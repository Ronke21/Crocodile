<text>The road hierarchy organizes roads according to their functions and capacities. While sources differ on the exact nomenclature, the basic hierarchy comprises freeways, arterials, collectors, and local roads. Generally, the functional hierarchy can more or less correspond to the hierarchy of roads by their owner or administrator.

The related concept of access management aims to provide access to land development, while ensuring traffic flows freely and safely on surrounding roads.

== General classification ==

=== Controlled-access highway ===

At the top of the hierarchy in terms of traffic flow and speed are controlled-access highways; their defining characteristic is the &quot;control of access&quot; to and from the road, meaning that the road cannot be directly accessed from properties or other roads, but only from specific connector roads. This indirection, in conjunction with high speed limits and multiple lanes, allows these roads to support fast traffic flow with high volume, in both urban and rural areas. They are at the bottom of the hierarchy in terms of access to property, allowing access to almost nothing besides other roads and rest areas.

They are also known as &quot;freeways&quot; in the U.S., South Africa, and parts of Australia; as &quot;motorways&quot; in the U.K., New Zealand, and parts of Australia; and as &quot;expressways&quot; in numerous countries.

Controlled-access highways do not have traffic signals nor at-grade crossings with other roads (intersections), railways, or pedestrian paths. When a road&#x27;s path would intersect a controlled-access highway, a flyover (US: overpass or underpass) will vertically separate the two roads, preventing the need for an intersection. Pedestrian footbridges and tunnels are also grade-separated. The opposing directions of travel are separated by a central reservation (UK) or median strip (US) generally a few meters to a few dozen meters wide, which may consist of a traffic barrier or a natural barrier like grass. This separation makes controlled-access highways a subset of dual carriageways (UK) or divided highways (US). Generally, these roads prohibit pedestrians and vehicles not powered by a motor (e.g., bicycles). Parking is also generally prohibited.

==== Highway systems ====

In many countries, the controlled-access highways form an expansive system that generally connect distant cities within the country to each other, but there are often more highways that only have local courses designed to improve connections in a smaller region, such as within a metropolitan area. Controlled-access highways are often given numbers to form a national highway system, such as the &quot;Bundesautobahn&quot; in Germany or the Interstate Highway System in the United States, but note that a national highway system may also consist of other numbered highways that are not implemented as controlled-access highways. Some countries may have more than one national highway system of a lower rank, such as the U.S. Highways (not to be confused with the Interstate system), only portions of which run on controlled-access highways. Conversely, there may also be controlled-access highways not part of a numbered system. Highways are usually given icons featuring the number of the highway called highway shields or route markers. In addition to the national highway system, there may be provincial-level or state-level (US) highway systems of a lower rank, which need not consist mainly of controlled-access highways.

Slip roads (UK) or ramps (US) are special connector roads that allow traffic access to and from a controlled-access highway. Their length is normally on the order of several hundred meters in order to allow vehicles a sufficient distance to safely change speed while transferring from one road to the other road. The course of a ramp is often curved as needed in order to connect the two roads without sharp turns, which require vehicles to slow down considerably to traverse them safely. In many cases, a ramp may be subject to grade separation and use a flyover. In the US, where the standard term for a flyover is &quot;overpass&quot; (or &quot;underpass&quot;, when the road with level altitude is the higher road), the word &quot;flyover&quot;, which is less common, is reserved for those that carry ramps. Entrance ramps (or on-ramps) allow &quot;ingress&quot; traffic to enter the highway, and exit ramps (or off-ramps) allow &quot;egress&quot; traffic to exit the highway.

Ramps may be described by their orientation. A &quot;directional&quot; ramp curves toward the desired direction of travel, a &quot;semi-directional&quot; ramp exits on the side of the road opposite to the desired direction of travel, then curves back toward the desired direction, and a &quot;non-directional&quot; ramp curves away from the desired direction of travel (such as the looping ramps in a cloverleaf interchange).

The full set of ramps that connect a controlled-access highway to another road is called a grade-separated junction (UK) or interchange (US). The interchange is classified as a system interchange if traffic remains in the highway system, traveling from one controlled-access highway to another, or a service interchange if the interchange serves a local area by allowing travel between a controlled-access highway and a road without access control. The controlled-access highway is called the &quot;mainline&quot;, and the uncontrolled road is called the &quot;crossroad&quot;. More complex interchanges involving many roads may have characteristics of both types of interchanges as required.

The number of directions one can travel toward or away from the interchange on all of the roads involved is the number of &quot;legs&quot;. When two roads meet, there are four paths to and from the interchange, and so the interchange has four legs, but if one of the roads terminates at the interchange, it will only have three legs. Interchanges with more legs require joining elements from four- and three-legged interchanges in order to permit travel from any one direction to any other direction. If all possible connections exist, it is a &quot;complete interchange&quot; providing &quot;complete access&quot;; if not, it is an &quot;incomplete interchange&quot; providing &quot;incomplete access&quot;.

=== Limited-access road ===

A limited-access road, often called a limited-access highway (US), divided highway (US), or dual carriageway (UK), and in some situations an expressway, is similar to a controlled-access highway in that it conforms to many or most of the standards that controlled-access highways follow, but does allow some uncontrolled access to local roads. They can be viewed as a middle ground between controlled-access highways and arterial roads. The degree of isolation from local traffic varies between countries and regions, as does a precise definition of the term itself.

Controlled-access highways can also be viewed as a subset of limited-access highways that has stricter requirements.

=== Arterial road ===

An arterial road or arterial thoroughfare is a road without controlled access that can carry a large volume of local traffic at a generally high speed, being below controlled-access highways in the hierarchy. Because their primary function is to connect collector roads (below) to controlled-access highways, some are considered limited-access roads.

Intersections of arterial roads are almost always at-grade, and use traffic signals to coordinate traffic that would otherwise intersect, but traffic signals are often omitted when minor collector roads intersect, usually placing a stop sign at the collector road to prevent the traffic on the arterial road from being impeded.

Arterial roads almost always have multiple lanes to allow for high capacity. They do not allow for access to residential properties under most circumstances.

=== Collector road ===
A collector road, also known as a distributor road, is a road that allows high access to properties and has a low to moderate capacity and a generally low speed limit. They are below arterial roads in terms of speed and capacity, but higher in terms of access, as they can allow access to residential properties.

Collector roads can vary widely in appearance. Some urban collectors are wide boulevards entering communities or connecting sections. Others are residential streets, which are typically wider than local roads, although few are wider than four lanes. Small-scale commercial areas can be found on collector roads in residential areas. Key community functions such as schools, churches, and recreational facilities can often be found on collector roads.

A collector road usually consists of a mixture of signaled intersections, roundabouts, traffic circles, or stop signs, often in the form of four-way stops. Two-way stops are generally used at intersections with local streets that favour traffic movement on the collector. In North America, a collector road normally has traffic lights at intersections with arterial roads, whereas roundabouts and two-way stops are more commonly used in Europe.

Speed limits are typically 20‑35 mph (30‑60 km/h) on collector roads in built-up areas, depending on the degree of development and frequency of local access, intersections, and pedestrians, as well as the surrounding area (the speed tends to be lowest in school zones). Traffic calming is occasionally used in older areas on collector roads as well.

=== Local road ===

A local road, also called a street, is a road in a built environment that has all kinds of properties beside it which can be accessed from the road or a parking lot connected to the road. Different types of local roads include residential streets, avenues, and alleys. They have the lowest speed limits and capacities in the hierarchy, but have the highest access to property.

Local roads have at-grade intersections and have similar specifications to collector roads. Local roads may be unpaved in some cases. A common feature of local roads is driveways, which connect the road to a residential property.

== United States and Canada ==
=== Freeways ===
At the top of the hierarchy are limited access roads: Freeways or on- and off-ramps. These allow the freeway to operate with less friction at an even higher speed and with higher flow. Often freeways are included in the next category, arterials.

=== Arterials ===
Arterials are major through roads that are expected to carry large volumes of traffic. Arterials are often divided into major and minor arterials, and rural and urban arterials.

In some places there are large divided roads with few or no driveways that cannot be called freeways because they have occasional at-grade intersections with traffic lights that stop traffic (expressways in California, dual carriageways in Britain) or they are just too short (superarterials in Nevada). Such roads are usually classified as arterials.

Frontage roads are often used to reduce the conflict between the high-speed nature of an arterial and property access concerns.

===Collectors===
Collectors (not to be confused with collector lanes, which reduce weaving on freeways), collect traffic from local roads, and distribute it to arterials. Traffic using a collector is usually going to or coming from somewhere nearby.

===Local roads===
At the bottom of the hierarchy are local streets and roads. These roads have the lowest speed limit, and carry low volumes of traffic. In some areas, these roads may be unpaved.

== Europe ==

Most of Europe has a legal system based on European and international treaties which define at European/international level three types of road: motorways, express roads, and other roads. This vision comes from the 20th century and is limited to traffic code and legal issues. Each nation has its own Hierarchy of roads, although there is also a European road numbering at European level, for European roads.

Most of Europe has adopted Motorways (Autoroutes/Autobahnen/Autopistas/Autostrade), usually similar to those in France and the UK. The idea was originally developed in Germany, where all motorways are toll-free, and has spread widely. All major through routes in the EU and neighbouring countries have a European E-Road number in addition, or in the case of some countries&#x27; motorways, instead of a national number. In the UK, Albania, Iceland, Andorra and Cyprus these numbers are not displayed (although in Cyprus, signposted E roads indicate miscellaneous roads).

Otherwise, most other European countries have some form of differentiating between national routes, regional and inter-regional roads and other local routes.
===Comparison of symbols and names===
Here there is a table comparing the symbols and generic names of the various route types in Europe. Not shown are the expressways and municipal-level routes, as these categories seldom have specific signage. Some countries have two categories of secondary routes, in which case they are shown here in hierarchical order.
===United Kingdom ===
====Motorway====
Motorways, similar to freeways, these high-speed roads are designated with an M prefix or (M) suffix. e.g. M1, A1(M). The speed limit is generally and there is a &quot;hard shoulder&quot;, an often slightly narrower lane next to lane 1, which is usually only to be used in cases of an emergency. Emergency telephones are located every mile along the route so motorists with broken-down vehicles can contact the authorities, although this is increasingly being done using mobile phones. Signs are blue with white text for both destinations and motorway numbers. In general, junctions are given numbers which are displayed prominently, sometimes with a letter suffix, in a small black box on all the signs for any given junction. Junctions are generally signed one mile before they exit, with three or four further signs as the junction is reached, although on busy urban stretches this first warning can reduce to about ⅓mile. Cyclists, pedestrians, mopeds, very slow vehicles and certain other traffic are banned.

====Primary A-road====
Green on maps and signs. A main recommended route these can be single track as in North West Sutherland or more usually single carriageway or dual carriageway. The primary road network is fully connected, meaning you can reach any part from any other without leaving the network. Some of the major dual carriageway primary routes have numbered junctions or hard shoulders in the style of the Continental semi-motorways. Many Primary Routes are largely or wholly subject to clearway restrictions, and in major cities they may be classed as red routes. Emergency telephones, if present at all, are usually infrequent - there may be some additional telephones operated by the UK&#x27;s two main motoring organisations, the RAC and the AA, but these are becoming rarer.

====Non-primary A-road====
Often exists where the route is important but there is a nearby primary route (A or motorway) which duplicates this road&#x27;s function. Shown as red on maps, and has white signage with black lettering. Some non-Primary A-class roads are partially subject to clearway restrictions.

====B road====
Regional in nature and used to connect areas of lesser importance. Usually shown as brown or yellow on maps and have the same white signs as non-Primary A-Class routes. If the route is primary, like the B6261, then it will be shown the same as a Primary A-Class route.

====C road====

C roads are used as local authority designations for routes within their area for administrative purposes. These routes are not shown on small-scale road maps, but have occasionally been known to appear on road signs.

====Unclassified====
Unclassified roads are local roads with no defined destination. Local destinations may, however, be signed along them.

=== France ===

In France, one hierarchy of road is based on the &quot;owner&quot; who manages the road.
Independently of that, roads can have various specificities such as speed or crossings.

====Autoroutes====
Along with the rest of Europe, France has Motorways or &quot;Autoroutes&quot; similar to the British network. Unlike in the UK, the network is mostly accessible on payment of a toll, which is usually distance-dependent; there are generally more Toll (&quot;péage&quot;) Motorways in the South of France. However, sections passing through or close to major towns and cities are usually free. As in the UK, destinations reached via a motorway are shown with white text on a blue background. Junctions are usually numbered, the numbers being shown on signs in a small oval in the corner of the sign.

====Route Nationale====
Before the construction of Autoroutes, the &quot;Routes Nationales&quot; were the highest classification of road. They are denoted by a route number beginning N, or occasionally, RN. Going back to a Napoleonic road classification system, these are main roads comparable with British Primary Routes. They are maintained directly by the state and are usually the shortest route between major centres. Many N-Class roads are dual carriageway for some or all of their length, with a few also being given the designation of semi-motorway, where junctions are grade-separated and there is a central reservation with crash barrier. The hard shoulder, or &quot;bande d&#x27;arrêt d&#x27;urgence&quot;, is often narrower than on full motorways and there are fewer emergency telephones.

====Routes Départementales====
France (including overseas territory) is split into 100 departments, the second-highest tier of local government, similar to a UK county or US state. The departments have responsibility for all roads beginning with a letter D, or occasionally RD. These roads vary in quality, from newly built local dual carriageways and downgraded &quot;Routes Nationales&quot; to winding roads that are barely wide enough for traffic to pass. Generally, they are quieter than the Routes Nationales, and of a reasonable standard.

====Routes Communales====
In general, each settlement in France is a Commune - akin to a British Civil Parish. This most local level of government is responsible for maintaining all the local roads, which are numbered with a letter C prefix. Except in major towns and cities, where their numbers are usually not marked on signs, they are usually single-track and may be in a state of poor repair due to the large number of roads covered by populations as small as 10.

=== Hungary ===
Hungarian road categories are as follows:
* Gyorsforgalmi út (controlled-access highway):
**Autópálya (motorway): at least 2+2 travel lanes and 1+1 emergency lane, central reservation, no at-grade intersections, speed limit: 130 km/h 
**Autóút (expressway): 1+1 or more travel lanes, optionally emergency lanes and central reservation, some at-grade intersections(only if 1+1 lanes), speed limit: 110 km/h 
*Főút (arterial road or main road) (with one digit in their name, e.g.: 6-os út)
*Megyei út (county road) (with two digits, e.g.: 16-os út)
*Helyi út (local road) (with three or more digits)
etc.

===Italy===
====Autostrade====


Italy was the first country in the world to build motorways, the so-called &quot;autostrade&quot;, reserved for fast traffic and for motor vehicles only. The &quot;Autostrada dei Laghi&quot; (&quot;Lakes Motorway&quot;), the first built in the world, connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore, and now parts of the Autostrada A8 and the Autostrada A9, was devised by Piero Puricelli and was inaugurated in 1924.

Other motorways (or &quot;autostrade&quot;) built before World War II in Italy were Naples-Pompeii, Florence-Pisa, Padua-Venice, Milan-Turin, Milan-Bergamo-Brescia and Rome-Ostia. The total length of the Italian motorway system is about , as of 30 July 2022. To these data are added 13 motorway spur routes, which extend for . The density is of motorway for every of Italian territory.

In particular, of the Italian motorway network have three lanes per carriageway, have four lanes per carriageway, have five lanes per carriageway, while the remaining part is two lanes per carriageway. The density is of motorway for every of Italian territory.

Italian motorways (or &quot;autostrade&quot;) are mostly managed by concessionaire companies. From 1 October 2012 the granting body is the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and no longer Anas and the majority ( in 2009) are subject to toll payments. On Italian motorways, the toll applies to almost all motorways not managed by Anas. The collection of motorway tolls, from a tariff point of view, is managed mainly in two ways: either through the &quot;closed motorway system&quot; (km travelled) or through the &quot;open motorway system&quot; (flat-rate toll).

Italy&#x27;s motorways (or &quot;autostrade&quot;) have a standard speed limit of for cars. Limits for other vehicles (or when visibility is poor due to weather) are lower. Legal provisions allow operators to set the limit to on their concessions on a voluntary basis if there are three lanes in each direction and a working SICVE, or Safety Tutor, which is a speed-camera system that measures the average speed over a given distance. 

In order for a road to be classified as an &quot;autostrada&quot;, various geometric and construction conditions must be satisfied and these, although very similar in basis (for example the width of the travel lanes must be ) are not constant: there are different technical-legal regulations for motorways built in urban or extra-urban areas.

&quot;Autostrade&quot; are mostly managed by concessionaire companies. In North and Central Italy, the Autostrade mainly consists of tollways managed by Autostrade per l&#x27;Italia, a holding company controlled by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. Other operators include ASTM, ATP, and Autostrade Lombarde in the north-west; Autostrada del Brennero, A4 Holding, , and in the north-east; , SALT, SAT, and Autocisa in the center; and CAS in the south.

====Extra-urban roads====
In Italy, a dual carriageway is often called &quot;superstrada&quot; (meaning &quot;expressway&quot;), but this name is unofficial. Italian Highway Code (&quot;Codice della strada&quot;) divides dual carriageways into three different classifications:
* &quot;strada extraurbana principale&quot; (meaning &quot;main highway&quot;) or &quot;type-B road&quot;: a road with separate carriageways, at least two lanes for each direction, paved shoulder on the right and no cross-traffic. This type of road is quite similar to an &quot;autostrada&quot; or &quot;type-A road&quot; (Italian official name for motorways or freeways), but its building standards are lower. Access limitations and drive behaviour on type-B roads are the same as the motorways (no pedestrians, bicycles and other slow vehicles), as well as the signage (except for the background color, that is blue instead of green). Speed limits on type-B roads are up to . Type-B roads are always toll-free.
* &quot;strada extraurbana secondaria&quot; (meaning &quot;secondary road&quot;) or &quot;type-C road&quot;. This category contains all the roads in non-urban context that are neither &quot;autostrada&quot; (type A) nor &quot;strada extraurbana principale&quot; (type B). This means that a dual carriageway that may not be classified as type-B road, since it does not meet such quality standards, belongs to this category. For type-C roads, there are neither special signage nor access restrictions, unless a specific sign is placed. The speed limit is , on both single and dual carriageways.

====Urban roads====
These are the roads present within inhabited centers. Urban roads are of three types:
* &quot;strada urbana di scorrimento&quot; (meaning &quot;urban expressway&quot;) or &quot;type-D road&quot;: a road in urban context, with separate carriageways, and at least two lanes for each direction. At-level junctions with smaller roads, regulated by traffic lights, are allowed as well as roundabouts. Unless a prohibition sign is placed, there are not access restrictions. Speed limits on this type of road are up to .
* &quot;strada urbana di quartiere&quot; (meaning &quot;urban neighborhood road&quot;) or &quot;type E road&quot;: single carriageway road with at least two lanes, paved shoulders and sidewalks; for parking there are areas equipped with a special maneuvering lane, outside the roadway;
** &quot;strada urbana ciclabile&quot; (meaning &quot;urban cycle road&quot;) or &quot;type E-bis road&quot;: urban road with a single carriageway, with paved shoulders and sidewalks, with a speed limit of no more than 30 km/h, defined by specific vertical and horizontal signs, with priority for bicycles.
* &quot;strada locale&quot; (meaning &quot;local road&quot;) or &quot;type F road&quot;: urban or extra-urban road not belonging to the other types of roads;
** &quot;strada vicinale&quot;: is a privately owned road of local interest located outside the town centre. In Italy the local road is a de facto communication route built to access a series of plots of land, or generally to connect to a road.
** &quot;itinerario ciclopedonale&quot; (meaning &quot;cycle/pedestrian itinerary&quot;) or &quot;type F-bis road&quot;: local, urban, extra-urban or local road, mainly intended for pedestrian and cycle travel, and characterized by intrinsic safety to protect vulnerable road users.

=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
The road hierarchy in the Czech Republic and Slovakia originates from the Czechoslovak 1961 road act, although both countries have made changes since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

==== Motorways ====
Motorways (, ) form the trunk of the road network, and similarly to other European countries they include at least 2 lanes in each direction, as well as an emergency lane on the right and auxiliary lanes for entering and leaving the motorway in intersections. In both countries, motorways use white-on-green directional signage. The general speed limit for motorways in both countries is 130 kilometers per hour, which is implicitly decreased to 80 km/h (Czech Republic) or 90 km/h (Slovakia) in urban areas.

In both the Czech Republic and Slovakia, motorways are designated by a number prefixed by the letter D. Both countries also use red rectangular shields with the motorway number in both countries, although in Slovakia the shield includes the D prefix, while in the Czech Republic it only contains the number itself.

Slovakia, as well as the Czech Republic before 2016, also operates a complementary expressway network (, ), which consists of limited access highways that don&#x27;t fully meet the motorway standards. They are designated by a number prefixed by the letter R. Slovak expressways use similar highway shields as motorways, albeit with the different prefix. The term &quot;motor vehicle road&quot; (, ) has also been used variably to refer to the network, although in both countries this term is now used for a separate category of roads.

The same rules of the road as on motorways also apply on expressways, including the speed limits and the white-on-green signage, although they used to be legally distinct from proper motorways and instead considered to be a part of the regular highway network. This led the Czech Republic to discontinue the system in 2016, when most former expressways were upgraded to motorway status, while Slovakia passed an amendment in 2020 that redefined expressways as a type of motorway.

In both countries, all motorways and expressways are owned and maintained by the state and the use of most of their sections is paid via electronic vignettes or toll. Bypasses of large towns and other sections that are used for local traffic tend to be exempt from the vignette requirement.

==== Highways ====
The highway network is divided into three classes, which are distinguished by the number of digits in the highway number. The class number can be optionally mentioned in written text alongside the road number, separated by a slash. First and second class roads in both countries use blue rectangular shields. Slovak third class roads use a white oval highway shield.

* First class roads (, ) are designated by an up to two-digit number and are owned by the state. Road numbers 61 and above run exclusively on Slovak territory under the original Czechoslovak numbering.
* Second class roads (, ) are designated by a three-digit number and are owned by the regions. The first digit identifies the general location of the route:
** 1xx - south Bohemia
** 2xx - north Bohemia
** 3xx - east Bohemia, Vysočina
** 4xx - Moravia and Silesia
** 5xx - Slovakia
** 6xx - former first class roads replaced by a motorway (Czech Republic only)
* Third class roads (, ) are also owned by the regions. In the Czech Republic, these are designated by four to five-digit numbers, where the first three digits are the number of a nearby higher class road, padded by zeroes if less than three digits. Slovakia renumbered these roads in 2015, and now uses a four digit numbering where the first three digits identify the district that the road runs in. The road numbers are not marked on most maps and road signs in the Czech Republic, however, Slovakia started doing so after the reform.

The general speed limit on highways is 90 kilometers per hour, reduced to 50 km/h in urban areas. A section of a highway can also be signed as a road for motor vehicles (, ), which are off-limits for other kinds of traffic. The speed limit on such roads in the Czech Republic is 90 km/h for single carriageways and 110 km/h for double carriageways, reduced to 80 km/h in urban areas.

==== Local roads ====
Local roads (, ) are public roads that serve local traffic and are not already part of a highway or a motorway. They are owned and maintained by municipalities. Similarly to highways, they are divided into four classes according to their importance, where the first class includes the most important collector roads in cities, while the fourth class includes walk paths and bike roads that are off-limits to automobiles. The Road Act also allows for so-called &quot;express local roads&quot; to be built up to expressway standards to accommodate for fast motor traffic.

In the Czech Republic, a first class local road can be signed as a road for motor vehicles if there are no intersections with other roads, auxiliary lanes are used for entering and exiting the road and access to adjacent buildings is forbidden. Local roads typically use the same directional signage as highways, i.e. white-on-blue signs with local destinations in black-on-white rectangles, although full black-on-white signs are increasingly adopted, notably by Prague.

==== Utilitarian roads ====
Utilitarian roads (, ) can be owned by any subject, private as well as public. Such roads are often subject of litigations because the legal status is a bit inconsistent and unclear. 
* Publicly accessible utilitarian roads have similar traffic mode as local roads; generally, forest roads and field roads are count among &quot;utilitarian/purpose roads&quot;. However, motor vehicles are prohibited at the forest roads by the Forest Act. The national law doesn&#x27;t concern over compensations or subventions to the owner, and the duty of maintenance is questionable and not stated explicitly by the law. 
* Closed utilitarian roads tend to be located in enclosed objects or facility; outside of them, the owner needs an administrative decision to exclude or restrict the public traffic. Traffic rules applies to such communications, but the owner can permit exceptions.

==== History ====
Until 1938, separate lands of Czechoslovakia have different laws and road systems, inherited from the Austro-Hungarian period. Just in 1938, a unified Czechoslovak road act passed. In 1935, there existed Czechoslovak state roads (not distinguished by class) and several types of non-state public roads: 
* in Bohemia, silnice zemské (land roads), silnice okresní (district roads), silnice a cesty obecní (municipal roads and ways) (there was only one remained 23 km land road in Bohemia, connecting Jilemnice, Vysoké nad Jizerou and Rokytnice nad Jizerou)
* in Moravia, silnice okresní (district roads) of 1st and 2nd class, silnice a cesty obecní (municipal roads and ways)
* in Czech Silesia, silnice okresní (district roads) of 1st and 2nd class, silnice a cesty obecní (municipal roads and ways) and veřejné cesty interesentů (public ways of interesents)
* in Slovakia and Zakarpattia, zemské cesty (land roads, formerly župné cesty, župa roads), príjezdné cesty (access roads), vicinální cesty (vicinal roads), cesty obecné (municipal roads and ways) and cesty interesentů (ways of interesents). 
Thus, in the Moravian-Silesian Land existed no land roads, in Slovakia and Zakarpattia were no district roads but existed a special class of &quot;access roads&quot;, and in Bohemian and Moravia existed not a status of &quot;public ways of interesents&quot;.

Historically, local communications is a successor term for the former obecní silnice (municipal roads) and obecní cesty (municipal ways). The terms &quot;utilitarian communications&quot; replaced the former term cesty interesentů or zájemnické cesty (ways of interesents) since 1961. However, in Bohemia and Moravia, public way on a private plot was concepted as a municipal way before the 1961 reform, and maintained by the municipality.

Příjezdní komunikace (access communications) to the railway stations were a special class of roads before 1938 in Slovakia nad Zakarpattia. Since 1938, access communications to railway stations, airports and ports should be built as municipal roads or district roads, as was the previous praxis in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. Paradoxically, the today&#x27;s main access road to the main Prague airport (Václav Havel International Airport in Prague-Ruzyně) is a private property of the airport and has a status of a &quot;utilitarian communication&quot;.

Czechoslovak act no. 147/1949 Sb. nationalized all previous státní (state), zemské (land), and okresní (district) roads and authorized the government to list other individual roads (vicinal, municipal and others) to be nationalized) or negotiate a transfer of redundant state roads to administration by municipalities. The Czechoslovak act no. 135/1961 Sb. stated a terminology and classification which is in essence continued in today&#x27;s Czech Republic and Slovakia.

=== Poland ===

Polish road categories are as follows:
* National roads (Drogi krajowe) – trunk roads, international E-road (motorways and express roads)
* Voivodeship road (Drogi wojewódzkie) – regional roads
* County roads (Drogi powiatowe)
* Communal roads (Drogi gminne) – communal/municipal roads

=== Portugal ===

Portugal roads&#x27; categories are as follows:
* Autoestradas (A) - Motorways, most of them with tolls
* Itinerários Principais (IP) - North-south and east-west country-wide roads
* Itinerários Complementares (IC) - Roads that branch from Itinerários Principais
* Estradas Nacionais (N) - Roads used to link cities, municipal seats, and other important sites that are not linked by one of the precedent road types
* Estradas Regionais (R) - Roads linking places of interest within the region they were built in
* Estradas Municipais (M) - Roads linking different places within a município

=== Romania ===
In Romania the roads are classified as:
* Autostrăzi (A) - Motorways
* Drumuri naționale și europene (DN, E) - National and European roads
* Drumuri naționale (DN) - National roads
* Drumuri județene (DJ) - County roads
* Drumuri comunale (DC) - Communal roads

=== Cyprus ===
In Cyprus the roads are classified as:

* A: The motorways of Cyprus (Αυτοκινητόδρομος) are mainly 2 lanes on each side but some areas in Nicosia and Limassol have 3 lanes on each side
* B: The trunk-roads of Cyprus. These are mainly the old roads the motorways have replaces but not all of them are. These link towns together and also include some ring-roads. Most of these are single-carriageway 2 lane roads but a few of them are 4 lane dual-carriageway.
* E: These are main roads which go through multiple villages and small towns and are built similarly to B roads. A few of them can also be 4 lane dual-carriageways.
* F: The small village roads which normally only serve 1 or a few villages. These can be 2 lane roads but also a few of them are 1 lane but wide enough for 2 cars to pass
* Unclassified: The broadest type of classifications. These can be dirt-roads leading to farms and can also be dual-carriageways. The majority of them are 1 or 2 lane roads in towns or villages.

<text>The Courier-Post is a morning daily newspaper that serves South Jersey in the Delaware Valley. It is based in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and serves most of Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester counties. The paper has 30,313 daily paid subscribers and 41,078 on Sunday.

As the fifth-largest newspaper published in New Jersey, the &quot;Courier-Post&quot;″s main competitors are &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania, and the &quot;Burlington County Times&quot; and &quot;South Jersey Times&quot; in South Jersey.

Established in 1875, the &quot;Post&quot; moved to Camden in 1879. It merged with &quot;The Telegram&quot; in 1899 to become &quot;The Post &amp; Telegram&quot;. In 1926, &quot;The Post &amp; Telegram&quot; and the &quot;Camden Courier&quot; consolidated under owner J. David Stern.

The merged paper was bought by the Gannett newspaper chain in 1959.

<text>Landoald &#x27;Lando&#x27; Ndasingwa (died 7 April 1994) was a Rwandan politician and businessman. He was killed on the first day of the Rwandan genocide.

== Life ==

Ndasingwa founded the hotel Chez Lando in the 1980s with his Canadian wife Hélène. Following Ndasingwa&#x27;s death, the hotel was taken over by his sister Anne-Marie Kantengwa.

Educated at the Collège Saint-André of Kigali, the Université Nationale du Rwanda at Butare, Université Laval at Quebec City, McGill University, and Université de Montréal, Ndasingwa was a former professor at the Université Nationale du Rwanda and ethnic Tutsi. As a politician, he was the leader and vice president of the moderate Liberal Party and was granted the portfolio of Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the Habyarimana transitional government put in place after the Arusha Accords. He was the only Tutsi member of the transitional government.

On February 17, 1994, UNAMIR commander Roméo Dallaire received information of a plot to assassinate Ndasingwa and Joseph Kavaruganda, both prominent political moderates. In his book &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, Dallaire claims that he informed them of this plot, and neither were surprised. As an outspoken and well-known public figure, Ndasingwa was the frequent target of attacks on propaganda radio station RTLM.

== Death ==
On April 7, 1994 , Ndasingwa and his Canadian wife, Hélène Pinski, both graduates of the Université de Montréal, were abducted from their house along with their two children, Malaika (age 17) and Patrick (age 15), and Ndasingwa&#x27;s mother by the government&#x27;s Presidential Guard, despite being under UNAMIR protection. All were subsequently killed the same day the assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira. During his final moments, he and his family requested UNAMIR troops for protection as the presidential guard assaulted their home, his final words being &quot;It&#x27;s too late.&quot;

One of his sisters, Louise Mushikiwabo, became much later (December 2009) Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in Paul Kagame&#x27;s government, and, then (October, 2018), Secretary General of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.

<doc id="1297662" wikidata="Q464075" url="?curid=1297662" title="2004 United States presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 2, 2004. Incumbent Republican President George W. Bush and his running mate, incumbent Vice President Dick Cheney, were re-elected to a second term. They narrowly defeated the Democratic ticket of John Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, and his running mate John Edwards, a senator from North Carolina.

Bush and Cheney were renominated by their party with no difficulty. Meanwhile, the Democrats engaged in a competitive primary. Kerry emerged as the early-front runner but was faced with serious opposition by former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who briefly surged ahead of Kerry in the polls. Kerry won the first set of primaries in January and re-emerged as the front-runner, and Dean dropped out in February. Kerry clinched his party&#x27;s nomination in March after a series of primary victories over runner-up Edwards, who he ultimately selected to be his running mate. 

The September 11, 2001, attacks decisively reshaped Bush&#x27;s foreign policy goals and garnered him near-universal support early in his term. However, by 2004 his handling of the war on terror attracted serious debate, particularly over his handling of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Bush presented himself as a decisive leader and attacked Kerry as a &quot;flip-flopper&quot;. Kerry criticized Bush&#x27;s conduct of the Iraq War, despite having voted for it himself. Domestic issues were debated as well, including the economy and jobs, health care, abortion, same-sex marriage, and embryonic stem cell research.

Bush won by a narrow margin of 35 electoral votes and took 50.7% of the popular vote. Bush swept the South and the Mountain states and took the crucial swing states of Ohio, Iowa, and New Mexico, the last two flipping Republican. Although Kerry flipped New Hampshire, Bush won both more electoral votes and states than in 2000. Ohio was the tipping-point state, and was considered to be the state that allowed Bush to win reelection. Some aspects of the election process were subject to controversy, although not to the degree seen in the 2000 presidential election. Bush won Florida by a 5% margin, a significant improvement over his razor-thin victory margin in the state four years earlier which led to a legal challenge in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;. This was the first presidential election since 1988 where a candidate won a majority of the popular vote. This was the last time a Republican candidate won the national popular vote until Donald Trump in 2024. It is also the most recent in which the Republican candidate won Colorado, New Mexico, and Virginia. 

This remains the most recent presidential election in which both major party candidates flipped at least one state, and the only presidential election since 1984 in which an incumbent Republican president won a second term. At the time, Bush also received the most popular votes in history, a record which would be broken in 2008. Bush also became the only incumbent president to win reelection after previously losing the popular vote and was the only Republican to win the popular vote between the eight elections of 1992 and 2020. In addition, this was one of only two elections in the 21st century in which a candidate from either party won fewer than 20 states, with the other being 2024, when Kamala Harris also won 19 states. This is the earliest presidential election of which all four of the presidential and vice presidential candidates of both major parties are still alive, and is the most recent to date in which both major party tickets did not include a woman or person of color. This along with the previous election would be the only ones between 1980 and 2024 where the winner won fewer than 300 electoral votes (or below 55% of the electoral college vote).

== Background ==
George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 after the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; remanded the case to the Florida Supreme Court, which declared there was not sufficient time to hold a recount without violating the U.S. Constitution. Just eight months into his presidency, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, suddenly transformed Bush into a wartime president. Bush&#x27;s approval ratings surged to near 90%. Within a month, the forces of a coalition led by the United States entered Afghanistan, which had been sheltering Osama bin Laden, suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks. The Taliban had been removed by December, although a long reconstruction would follow.

The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam&#x27;s regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the UN sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces; however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Nevertheless, on May 1, Bush landed on the aircraft carrier , in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of &quot;major combat operations&quot; in the Iraq War.

== Nominations ==

=== Republican nomination ===

Bush was able to ward off any serious challenge to the Republican nomination. Senator Lincoln Chafee from Rhode Island considered challenging Bush on an anti-war platform in New Hampshire but decided not to run after the capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003. On March 10, 2004, Bush officially attained the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. He accepted the nomination on September 2, 2004, and retained Vice President Dick Cheney as his running mate. During the convention and throughout the campaign, Bush focused on two themes: defending America against terrorism and building an ownership society. The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their Social Security in the stock market, increasing home and stock ownership, and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance.

=== Democratic Party nomination ===


==== Withdrawn candidates ====
==== Democratic primaries ====

The 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries took place from January 14 to June 8, 2004, to select the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for president. Before the primaries, Vermont governor Howard Dean was a favorite to win the nomination; however, Massachusetts senator John Kerry won victories in two early races: the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. These wins strengthened Kerry&#x27;s previously weak campaign. By March 11, Kerry had received enough delegates to win the nomination. Other major candidates included North Carolina senator John Edwards and retired U.S. Army general Wesley Clark. Kerry asked Republican senator John McCain to be his running mate but McCain turned down his offer. On July 6, Kerry selected Edwards as his running mate, shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention was held later that month in Boston.

==== Democratic National Convention ====
Heading into the convention, the Kerry–Edwards ticket unveiled its new slogan: a promise to make America &quot;stronger at home and more respected in the world&quot;. Kerry made his Vietnam War experience the convention&#x27;s prominent theme. The keynote address at the convention was delivered by Illinois state senator and U.S. Senate candidate and future president Barack Obama; the speech was well received, and it elevated Obama&#x27;s status within the Democratic Party.

=== Other nominations ===

There were four other presidential tickets on the ballot in a number of states totaling enough electoral votes to have a theoretical possibility of winning a majority in the Electoral College. They were:
* Michael Badnarik / Richard Campagna, Libertarian Party (campaign). Badnarik was nominated on the third ballot and Campagna on the first ballot at the Libertarian National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia, held May 28–31, 2004.
* David Cobb / Pat LaMarche, Green Party (campaign). Cobb was nominated on the second ballot at the 2004 Green National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, held June 23–28, 2004.
* Ralph Nader / Peter Camejo, independent (also Reform Party, Independent Party (DE), Populist Party (MD), Better Life Party, Cross-endorsements N.Y., Peace and Justice Party, Independence Parties of New York and South Carolina, and the Vermont Green Party who chose not to ratify the national party&#x27;s presidential nominee).
* Michael Peroutka / Chuck Baldwin, Constitution Party (also Alaskan Independence Party).  Peroutka and Baldwin were unanimously nominated at the Constitution Party National Convention at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania (June 23–26, 2004).

== Issues unique to the election ==
=== Electronic voting machines ===
Ahead of the 2004 election, some states implemented electronic voting systems. Critics raised several issues about voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems. Cybersecurity professionals found security vulnerabilities in Diebold machines. Voting machines made by several companies were also criticized for their lack of a paper trail, which would have made results easier to verify. Democrats also criticized various executives at Diebold, Inc. (the parent company of Diebold Election Systems) for their support of Bush&#x27;s campaign, stating that it constituted a conflict of interest. Following these issues, California banned the use of Diebold&#x27;s AccuVote TSX voting machines for elections in 2004.

=== Campaign law changes ===
The 2004 election was the first to be affected by the campaign finance reforms mandated by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. The act created restrictions on fundraising by political parties and candidates. A large number of independent 527 groups were created to bypass these restrictions. Named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code, these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes as long as they did not coordinate their activities with political campaigns. Examples of 527s include Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, MoveOn.org, the Media Fund, and America Coming Together. These groups were active throughout the campaign season, spending a record $556 million for all elections in 2004.

The Stand by Your Ad provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act required political advertisements on television to include a verbal disclaimer identifying the organization or campaign responsible for the advertisement. This provision was intended to force campaigns to take responsibility for negative advertisements. Campaign strategists criticized this requirement, stating that it would waste time and cause voters to be confused.

== General election campaign ==

=== Campaign issues ===

Bush focused his campaign on national security, presenting himself as a decisive leader and contrasted Kerry as a &quot;flip-flopper.&quot; This strategy was designed to convey to American voters the idea that Bush could be trusted to be tough on terrorism while Kerry would be &quot;uncertain in the face of danger.&quot; In the final months before the election, Kerry&#x27;s campaign focused on domestic issues such as the economy and health care. Kerry&#x27;s campaign managers believed that Kerry had an advantage on domestic issues. Bush&#x27;s campaign also focused on increasing voter turnout among conservatives. According to one exit poll, people who voted for Bush cited the issues of terrorism and traditional values as the most important factors in their decision. Kerry supporters cited the war in Iraq, the economy and jobs, and health care.

==== Economy ====

Tax cuts were passed in 2001 and 2003 under the Bush administration with Bush&#x27;s support. Kerry voted against these tax cuts. During the 2004 campaign, Bush praised these tax cuts, stating that they helped to grow the economy. On the other hand, Kerry attacked Bush for failing to create jobs under his presidency. Kerry stated that he wanted to reduce the United States budget deficit by capping government spending while ending various tax breaks for businesses. Kerry also supported tax credits for businesses that hire additional workers. Bush attacked Kerry for his economic proposals, stating that they would cause Americans to pay higher taxes. Bush also attacked Kerry for previously supporting tax raises, such as a proposed increase on the federal gas tax.

==== Foreign policy ====

Bush defended the Iraq War, arguing that it was necessary to stop terrorism. He also said that the United States had made progress stopping terrorism in other nations. Bush attacked Kerry for opposing the Iraq War after voting to authorize it in 2002, characterizing the shift as one of many flip-flops by Kerry. Kerry argued that Bush had misled the American public in pursuing the Iraq War, noting that no illegal weapons had been found in Iraq. He said that the Iraq War was a mistake and a diversion from terrorism in other nations such as Afghanistan. After the election, exit polls found that foreign policy concerns were the most important issues for voters.

==== Health care ====
Health savings accounts (HSAs) were introduced in 2004 as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, signed by Bush in December 2003. As part of his 2004 campaign, Bush supported the expansion of HSAs. He proposed tax cuts to help Americans purchase their own health insurance. He also proposed a plan that would allow small businesses to purchase health insurance in large groups. Kerry&#x27;s health care proposals included government subsidies for businesses that provide health insurance and the expansion of government-run health care programs. Health policy experts stated that Bush&#x27;s proposals would have a more limited impact than Kerry&#x27;s proposals. Kerry also attacked Bush for his policy on stem cell research. In 2001, the Bush administration restricted embryonic stem cell research to existing stem cell lines. Kerry stated that this restriction was a barrier to conducting important research.

==== Same-sex marriage ====
In July 2004, Bush announced his support for a Constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, shortly before the Senate voted on the amendment. Although Kerry stated that he opposed same-sex marriage, he also opposed the amendment, saying that the legality of same-sex marriage should be decided by individual states. The Senate vote failed on July 14.

=== Controversies ===

==== Bush military service controversy ====

During the campaign, Bush was accused of failing to fulfill his required service in the Texas Air National Guard. A scandal occurred at CBS News after they aired a segment on &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, introducing what became known as the Killian documents. These documents were allegedly written by Jerry B. Killian, Bush&#x27;s squadron commander, and they contained various allegations about Bush&#x27;s service. Serious doubts about the documents&#x27; authenticity quickly emerged, leading CBS to appoint a review panel that eventually resulted in the firing of the news producer and other significant staffing changes. The Killian documents were eventually concluded to be forgeries.

==== Kerry military service controversy ====

Kerry was accused by the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth of distorting his military service in Vietnam. The group challenged the legitimacy of each of the combat medals awarded to Kerry by the U.S. Navy, and the disposition of his discharge. The organization spent $22.4 million in advertisements against Kerry. After the election, political analysts described their advertising campaign as effective. The term swiftboating was used during the campaign to describe the organization&#x27;s negative advertising, which Democrats saw as unfair. It was also used after the campaign to generally describe a harsh attack by a political opponent that is dishonest, personal and unfair.

=== Presidential debates ===

Three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate were organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, and held in the autumn of 2004.

* The first debate was held on September 30, slated to focus on foreign policy. A consensus formed among mainstream pollsters and pundits that Kerry won the debate decisively, strengthening what had come to be seen as a weak and troubled campaign.
* On October 5, the vice presidential debate between Cheney and Edwards. An initial poll by ABC indicated a victory for Cheney, while polls by CNN and MSNBC gave it to Edwards.
* The second presidential debate was conducted in a town meeting format, less formal than the first presidential debate. This debate saw Bush and Kerry taking questions on a variety of subjects from a local audience.
* Bush and Kerry met for the third and final debate on October 13. 51 million viewers watched the debate. After Kerry, responding to a question about gay rights, reminded the audience that Vice President Cheney&#x27;s daughter was a lesbian, Cheney responded with a statement calling himself &quot;a pretty angry father&quot; due to Kerry using Cheney&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s sexual orientation for his political purposes. Polls taken by Gallup in found that Kerry pulled ahead in October, but showed a tight race as the election drew to a close.

=== Osama bin Laden videotape ===

On October 29, four days before the election, excerpts of a video of Osama bin Laden addressing the American people were broadcast on al Jazeera. In his remarks, bin Laden mentions the September 11 attacks, and taunted Bush over his response to them. In the days following the video&#x27;s release, Bush&#x27;s lead over Kerry increased by several points.

=== Electoral College forecasts ===
Elections analysts and political pundits issue probabilistic forecasts of the composition of the Electoral College. These forecasts use a variety of factors to estimate the likelihood of each candidate winning the Electoral College electors for that state. Most election predictors use the following ratings:
* &quot;tossup&quot;: no advantage
* &quot;tilt&quot; (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as &quot;lean&quot;
* &quot;lean&quot; or &quot;leans&quot;: slight advantage
* &quot;likely&quot;: significant, but surmountable, advantage
* &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot;: near-certain chance of victory

Below is a list of states considered by one or more forecast to be competitive; states that are deemed to be &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot; by forecasters &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and CNN.

=== Ballot access ===
=== 2004 United States Electoral College ===
One elector in Minnesota cast a ballot for president with the name of &quot;John Ewards&quot; written on it. The Electoral College officials certified this ballot as a vote for Edwards for president. The remaining nine electors cast ballots for Kerry. All ten electors in the state cast ballots for Edwards for vice president (Edwards&#x27;s name was spelled correctly on all ballots for vice president). This was the first time in U.S. history that an elector had cast a vote for the same person to be both president and vice president. Electoral balloting in Minnesota was performed by secret ballot, and none of the electors admitted to casting the Edwards vote for president, so it may never be known who the faithless elector was. It is not even known whether the vote for Edwards was deliberate or unintentional; the Republican Secretary of State and several of the Democratic electors have expressed the opinion that this was an accident.

During the campaign and as the results came in on the night of the election, there was much focus on Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. These three swing states were seen as evenly divided, and with each casting 20 electoral votes or more, they had the power to decide the election. As the final results came in, Kerry took Pennsylvania and then Bush took Florida, focusing all attention on Ohio.

The morning after the election, the winner was still undetermined. The result in Ohio would decide the winner, although the results in New Mexico and Iowa were also undetermined. Bush led in Ohio, but the state was still counting provisional ballots. In the afternoon of the day after the election, Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell announced that there were roughly 135,000 provisional ballots remaining. Kerry&#x27;s campaign believed that it was statistically impossible to erase Bush&#x27;s lead. Faced with this announcement, Kerry conceded defeat.

Bush became the first Republican to ever win without carrying New Hampshire, and the first to win the popular vote without Vermont and Illinois. This was the last time a president was re-elected to a consecutive term with a higher share of the electoral vote. Bush carried Colorado despite the state being Kerry&#x27;s birth state. Bush simultaneously lost his own birth state of Connecticut, making this the only election since 1864 where neither candidate carried their birth state. This election was the first time since 1976 that New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, Illinois, Michigan, and California voted for the losing candidate in the popular vote, as well as the first since 1980 that Maryland did so, and the first since 1948 that Delaware did so. Bush&#x27;s 2.4% popular vote margin is the smallest ever for a re-elected incumbent president surpassing the 1812 election.

Bush won three states that have not voted Republican since: Virginia, Colorado, and New Mexico. Virginia had voted Republican in every election from 1968 to 2004 but conversely has voted Democratic in every election since 2008. In contrast, this is the last election in which the losing candidate won any of the following states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. This is also the last time a Republican was elected without carrying Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. This election is the only time in history that every Northeastern state voted Democratic and every former Confederate state voted Republican in the same election. Thus, Bush is the only candidate to win without carrying any Northeastern electoral votes. Furthermore, this was the last election where both major party tickets consisted entirely of white men. This is also the last election where both parties flipped states and is also the most recent year when an incumbent candidate from either party would flip any states, with Bush taking the two which he did not win in 2000, in both New Mexico and Iowa.

, this was the last time Nevada voted for the Republican presidential candidate, and the only presidential election since 1988 in which the Republican nominee won the popular vote with a majority, and it remains the only presidential election since 1984 in which the incumbent Republican president won a second consecutive term. Bush also became the only incumbent president to win immediate re-election after previously losing the popular vote. Bush is the seventh Republican to have won re-election to a consecutive term, along with Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, William McKinley, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. The 2004 election had the highest turnout rate among eligible voters since 1968. This is one of only four U.S. presidential elections in which the winner did not carry any of the three Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; the others were 2000, 1916 and 1884.

== Aftermath ==
This is one of only two U.S. presidential elections, held since the Democrats and Republicans became the two major parties in U.S. politics, in which the winner did not carry any of the three Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; the other was 2000, when Bush was first elected.

=== Voting problems in Ohio ===
After the election, activists and election scholars criticized various issues with the election in Ohio. Long lines at polling places over seven hours were reported. An electronic voting machine erroneously gave thousands of extra votes to Bush. Professor Edward B. Foley stated that he believed that Ohio&#x27;s voting problems did not affect the outcome.

=== Objections and conspiracy theories ===


After the election, many blogs published false rumors claiming to show evidence that voter fraud had prevented Kerry from winning. Although the overall result of the election was not challenged by the Kerry campaign, Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb and Libertarian Party presidential candidate Michael Badnarik obtained a recount in Ohio. This recount was completed December 28, 2004, although on January 24, 2007, a jury convicted two Ohio elections officials of selecting precincts to recount where they already knew the hand total would match the machine total, thereby avoiding having to perform a full recount. Independent candidate Ralph Nader obtained a recount in 11 New Hampshire precincts that used Accuvote voting machines.

At the official counting of the electoral votes on January 6, an objection was made under the Electoral Count Act (now ) to Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes. Because the motion was supported by at least one member of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the law required that the two houses separate to debate and vote on the objection. In the House of Representatives, the objection was supported by 31 Democrats. It was opposed by 178 Republicans, 88 Democrats and one independent. Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats. Four people elected to the House had not yet taken office, and one seat was vacant. In the Senate, it was supported only by its maker, Barbara Boxer, with 74 senators opposed and 25 not voting. During the debate, no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote. Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome but &quot;to cast the light of truth on a flawed system which must be fixed now&quot;.

Kerry would later state that &quot;the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters&quot;. In the same article, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said: &quot;I&#x27;m not confident that the election in Ohio was fairly decided... We know that there was substantial voter suppression, and the machines were not reliable. It should not be a surprise that the Republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections. That&#x27;s what we suspect has happened.&quot;

<doc id="1297663" wikidata="Q7619153" url="?curid=1297663" title="Stoned Soul Picnic (The 5th Dimension album)">
<text>Stoned Soul Picnic is the third album by the American pop group The 5th Dimension, released in 1968. Early versions of the album had a lyric sheet inserted in the sleeve.

&quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot; was the third and final album by the group to be issued in both mono (SCM 91002) and stereo (SCS 92002) as monaural albums were being phased out during its release in 1968. As a result, mono copies were pressed in a limited quantity and are considered rare in the collectors market.

<text>Pär Anders Fridén (born 25 March 1973) is a Swedish vocalist, best known as the lead singer of the melodic death metal band In Flames. He was also the vocalist of Dark Tranquillity and side project Passenger.

==Career==

===Early career===
Fridén was originally the vocalist for Dark Tranquillity. He performed on their debut album, Skydancer, but left the band soon after. Two years later he joined In Flames. Coincidentally Mikael Stanne had left In Flames (being only a session player) and switched from rhythm guitar to lead vocals in Dark Tranquillity, so the two effectively traded places. Fridén was also the lead vocalist for another band known as Ceremonial Oath with In Flames founder Jesper Strömblad.

=== 1995–present: In Flames ===
Fridén started with In Flames on the 1996 album &quot;The Jester Race&quot;. On the album &quot;Whoracle&quot;, Niklas Sundin (of Dark Tranquillity) wrote the lyrics following the original synopsis by Fridén. On the 1999 album &quot;Colony&quot;, Fridén composed the lyrics himself, though Sundin still assisted by translating his lyrics from Swedish to English.

He is also the vocalist for the band Passenger as a side project.

Fridén also has done guest vocals on the album &quot;The Phantom Novels&quot;, by the metal band &quot;Grievance&quot;. He is the lead vocalist on the tracks&quot; Atrocity Upon Deceptions&quot;, &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Rhyme&quot; and &quot;The Mask of Sin.&quot;

In 2007 Fridén appeared as a guest vocalist on the Japanese bonus track &quot;See the Falling Sky&quot; on Caliban&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;The Awakening&quot;. As well as providing vocals for the track &quot;Dysfunctional Hours&quot; for the 20th anniversary Nuclear Blast Allstars compilation album, &quot;Out of the Dark&quot;.

His look changed dramatically following the release of In Flames 2002 release &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;. His previously clean-shaven look was replaced with a beard, and his long hair was put into dreadlocks. His vocal style has also changed, especially on the past three records. His low-tone, harsh death growl has evolved into a higher pitched scream, which is now supplemented by clean vocals and layers of backing vocals.

In addition to being a vocalist, Fridén is also a producer, with his most recent efforts being the albums: &quot;The Undying Darkness&quot; by Caliban in 2006 and &quot;Absolute Design&quot; by the band Engel in 2007.

He also co-wrote and performed scream vocals on the song &quot;Self vs Self&quot;, which appears on the third album of UK/Australian drum and bass band Pendulum alongside his bandmates Björn Gelotte and Peter Iwers.

In the summer of 2010, Fridén changed his appearance again by cutting off his dreadlocks, which he had grown since the release of &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;.

Fridén founded the ambient/electronic project If Anything, Suspicious in 2021. The project&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Lullabies for the Damned&quot;, was released in collaboration with OFFAIR in December 2021.

<doc id="1297672" wikidata="Q1604980" url="?curid=1297672" title="The Hendon Mob">
<text>The Hendon Mob are a group of four professional poker players from London, England: Joe Beevers, Barny Boatman, Ross Boatman, and Ram Vaswani.

The name of the group was first publicised by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper in September 2000. Joe Beevers is the only member of the group who actually comes from Hendon, but the others played in Hendon.

The Mob first became recognised for their appearances on the televised poker programme &quot;Late Night Poker&quot; (1999–2002). The Hendon Mob also regularly attends the annual World Series of Poker and other major tournaments. They have dozens of in the money results between them.
The Mob were used in series one of the British con-art documentary series &#x27;The Real Hustle&#x27;. Presenters R. Paul Wilson and Alexis Conran, posing as poker novices filming a documentary, beat the Mob by smuggling in decks stacked to their advantage.

==Sponsorship==
In 2004 and 2005, the Mob was sponsored by Prima Poker to the tune of $2 million worth of worldwide tournament buy-in fees. In exchange they played on the online Prima poker-room network. As part of the tour, the Mob challenged four-player teams of various nationalities to heads-up matches, culminating with the UK versus the U.S. in the inaugural Prima Transatlantic Cup in 2004. The Mob had won each of these international team matches until falling 3–1 to the US team of Phil Ivey, Andy Bloch, Chris Ferguson, and Paul Wolfe. The Mob&#x27;s deal with Prima expired at the end of 2005.

The Mob were then sponsored by Full Tilt Poker until September 2011, when the online poker site was accused of fraud. The deal was reinstated when Full Tilt Poker reached an agreement with the U.S Department of Justice.

==Other ventures==
The Hendon Mob is also a website that includes the biggest poker player database worldwide, that collects the results of every poker tournament in the world since 2000, indexed by location, date, and player. The origin of the information contained in the database was queried in a court action brought by rival website Pokerpages.com, and information sourced from Pokerpages.com has since been removed from the database. 
In July 2013 the Mob&#x27;s website was acquired by the Global poker index.

<text>Jakob Segal (17 April 1911 – 30 September 1995) was a Russian-born German biology professor at Humboldt University of Berlin in the former East Germany. He was one of the advocates of the conspiracy theory that HIV was created by the United States government at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin and two former members of East Germany&#x27;s secret police accused Segal of being a Soviet disinformation agent who worked for the KGB.

==Early life and education==

Segal was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, into a Lithuanian Jewish family, the son of Hermann Segal, a merchant from Kaunas (1880–1941), and Rebekka (&quot;née&quot; Schlimakowski; 1887–1941). He had an older brother, Moshe, an electrician. When he was 8, his family moved to Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). He was educated in Berlin and Munich, where he joined the Red Students&#x27; League (&quot;Roter Studentenbund&quot;) and the Communist Party of Germany. In 1933, he immigrated to France, where he furthered his studies in Toulouse before earning a doctorate in physiology from the Sorbonne in 1936.

During the Second World War, he and his German wife, Lilli (&quot;née&quot; Schlesinger, whom he had met at university in Toulouse) joined the resistance as part of the &quot;Main-d&#x27;œuvre immigrée&quot; and went underground. All of his family, including his parents and brother, were killed in the Holocaust. Lilli was arrested in 1943 and deported to Auschwitz in July 1944, but was sent to a work camp and survived by escaping that November. In 1946, he joined the Centre national de la recherche scientifique.

Following the Soviet annexation of Lithuania during the war, Segal and wife accepted Soviet citizenship. In the early 1950s, he moved to East Germany, reportedly on the recommendation of Soviet officials, becoming &quot;informeller Mitarbeiter&quot;. In 1952, he became a biology professor at Humboldt University in East Berlin, and in 1953 founded its Institute for Applied Bacteriology. From 1967 to 1970, he worked at the National Center for Scientific Research in Havana, Cuba. He moved to Mexico City, where he retired in the early 1970s before returning to East Berlin.

==Operation Infektion==
Segal was recruited out of retirement by the KGB for Operation INFEKTION, a disinformation campaign designed to spread the belief that HIV/AIDS was created by the United States Government. According to U.S. intelligence historian Thomas Boghardt, Segal possibly suspected it was a Soviet campaign when approached by the Stasi (MfS):

Segal, together with his wife and Ronald Dehmlow, a fellow retired professor from Humboldt, published a 47-page pamphlet titled &quot;AIDS—Its Nature and Origin&quot;, in which they speculated that AIDS was the creation of the U.S. government, which had first tested it on gay prison inmates. What became known as the &quot;Segal Report&quot; was distributed by the Stasi and KGB at the Eighth Conference of Non-Aligned Nations, held 1–6 September 1986 in Harare, Zimbabwe, which was attended by representatives of more than 100 Third World countries. It produced the desired effect at the conference, and its claims were reprinted in the press in more than 25 countries in Africa.

One of Segal&#x27;s claims was that Prof. Robert Gallo crossed the Visna sheep virus with the Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV I) in 1978 in the P4 laboratory of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick. Proponents of this theory claim that 90% of HIV RNA is found in Visna and 10% in HTLV I.

==HIV therapy hypothesis==

Segal suggested an HIV therapy of anti-inflammatory aspirin or ultraviolet radiation of the patient&#x27;s blood in order to reduce the metabolic activity of macrophages, which are host cells for HIV. He also supported the idea of a p24- vaccine without gp120 which was patented by Jonas Salk as &quot;Remune&quot;.

<text>Passion and Warfare is the second studio album by guitarist Steve Vai, released on May 22, 1990, through Relativity and Epic Records. It has been certified Gold by the RIAA.

==Background==
&quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; was written based on a series of dream sequences that Vai had when he was younger, and in the guitar music book of the album, Vai sums it up as &quot;Jimi Hendrix meets Jesus Christ at a party that Ben Hur threw for Mel Blanc&quot;. It was all recorded in The Mothership studio at his home in the Hollywood Hills, a building in which his guitar parts for Whitesnake&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; were also recorded. Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale has small spoken parts on the album; Coverdale, Adrian Vandenberg and Rudy Sarzo are credited with backing vocals. Vai states that planning the album started as early as 1982, but was shelved after joining the David Lee Roth band and not picked up again until parting ways with Roth in 1989.

&quot;The Audience Is Listening&quot; video received regular airplay on MTV.

===Recording methods===
Vai utilized many unusual recording techniques on the album. For what would come to be one of his most popular songs to date, &quot;For the Love of God&quot;, he fasted for ten days and recorded the song on the fourth day of the fast. &quot;Blue Powder&quot; was originally recorded in 1986 as a showcase track for Carvin, using their X-100B amplifier, and given away with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine in flexi disc format. Vai was introduced to Carvin by his mentor Frank Zappa, who had also used the X-100B. The drums were subsequently re-recorded for the album. The equipment used to record &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot; was: Ibanez JEM and Universe guitars; Charvel Green Meanie guitar; Marshall JCM900 and Carvin X-100B amplifiers; ADA MP-1 preamplifier; Boss DS-1 distortion pedal; Eventide H3000 harmonizer; Lexicon 480L. Like many other releases by Vai, the album is largely instrumental, with only spoken word pieces being featured in terms of vocals, which are performed by many guests.

===Legacy===
The song &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is available for download for the 2007 video game &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, and was voted the 29th best solo of all time by a readers&#x27; poll in &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine.

In 2016, Vai embarked on the Passion and Warfare 25th Anniversary World Tour, where he played the album in its entirety for the first time.

<text> (RTLM) (), nicknamed &quot;Radio Genocide&quot; or &quot;Hutu Power Radio&quot;, was a Rwandan radio station which broadcast from July 8, 1993, to July 31, 1994. It played a significant role in inciting the Rwandan genocide that took place from April to July 1994, and has been described by some scholars as having been a &quot;de facto&quot; arm of the Hutu regime in Rwanda.

The station&#x27;s name is French for &quot;Free Radio and Television of the Thousand Hills&quot;, deriving from the description of Rwanda as &quot;Land of a Thousand Hills&quot;. It received support from the government-controlled Radio Rwanda, which initially allowed it to transmit using their equipment.

Widely listened to by the general population, it projected hate propaganda against Tutsis, moderate Hutus, Belgians, and the United Nations Mission Assistant for Rwanda (UNAMIR). It is regarded by many Rwandan citizens (a view also shared and expressed by the UN war crimes tribunal) as having played a crucial role in creating the atmosphere of charged racial hostility that allowed the genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda to occur. A working paper published at Harvard University found that RTLM broadcasts were an important part of the process of mobilising the population, which complemented the mandatory &quot;Umuganda&quot; meetings. RTLM has been described as &quot;radio genocide&quot;, &quot;death by radio&quot; and &quot;the soundtrack to genocide&quot;.

==Prior to the genocide==

Planning for RTLM began in 1992 by Hutu hard-liners, in response to the increasingly non-partisan stance of Radio Rwanda and growing popularity of Rwandese Patriotic Front&#x27;s (RPF) Radio Muhabura. RTLM was established the next year, and began broadcasting in July 1993. The station railed against the on-going peace talks between the predominantly Tutsis RPF and President Juvénal Habyarimana, whose family supported the radio station. It became a popular station since it offered frequent contemporary musical selections, unlike state radio, and quickly developed a faithful audience among young Rwandans, who later made up the bulk of the Interahamwe militia.

Félicien Kabuga was allegedly heavily involved in the founding and bankrolling of RTLM, as well as &quot;Kangura&quot; magazine. In 1993, at an RTLM fundraising meeting organized by the MRND, Felicien Kabuga allegedly publicly defined the purpose of RTLM as the defence of Hutu Power.

The station is considered to have preyed upon the deep animosities and prejudices of many Hutus. The hateful rhetoric was placed alongside the sophisticated use of humor and popular Zairean music. It frequently referred to Tutsis as &quot;cockroaches&quot; (example: &quot;You [Tutsis] are cockroaches! We will kill you!&quot;).

Critics claim that the Rwandan government fostered the creation of RTLM as &quot;Hate Radio&quot;, to circumvent the fact they had committed themselves to a ban against &quot;harmful radio propaganda&quot; in the UN&#x27;s March 1993 joint communiqué in Dar es Salaam. However RTLM director Ferdinand Nahimana claimed that the station was founded primarily to counter the propaganda by RPF&#x27;s Radio Muhabura.

In January 1994, the station broadcast messages berating UNAMIR commander Roméo Dallaire for failing to prevent the killing of approximately 50 people in a UN-demilitarized zone.

After Habyarimana&#x27;s private plane was shot down on April 6, 1994, RTLM joined the chorus of voices blaming Tutsis rebels, and began calling for a &quot;final war&quot; to &quot;exterminate&quot; the Tutsis.

==During the genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda ==

During the genocide, the RTLM acted as a source for propaganda by inciting hatred and violence against Tutsis, against Hutus who were for the peace accord, against Hutus who married Tutsis, and by advocating the annihilation of all Tutsis in Rwanda. The RTLM reported the latest massacres, victories, and political event in a way that promoted their anti-Tutsi agenda. In an attempt to dehumanize and degrade, the RTLM consistently referred to Tutsis and the RPF as &#x27;cockroaches&#x27; during their broadcasts. The music of Hutu Simon Bikindi was played frequently. He had two songs, &quot;Bene Sebahinzi&quot; (&quot;Sons of the Father of the Farmers&quot;), and &quot;Nanga Abahutu&quot; (&quot;I Hate Hutus&quot;), which were later interpreted as inciting hatred against the Tutsis and genocide.

One of the major reasons that RTLM was so successful in communication was because other forms of news sources such as television and newspapers were not able to be as popularized because of lack of resources. In addition to this communication barrier, areas where there were high rates of illiteracy and lack of education amongst the citizens remain some of the most violent areas during the genocide against Tutsis. The villages outside of the transmission zone of RTLM experienced spillover violence from villages that actually received the radio transmissions. An estimated 10% of all the violence within the genocide against Tutsis resulted from the hateful radio transmissions sent out from RTLM. Not only did RTLM increase general violence, but full radio coverage areas increased the number of persons prosecuted for any violence by about 62–69%. However, a 2018 paper questions the findings of that study.

As the genocide was taking place, the United States military drafted a plan to jam RTLM&#x27;s broadcasts, but this action was never taken, with officials claiming that the cost of the operation, international broadcast agreements and &quot;the American commitment to free speech&quot; made the operation unfeasible.

When French forces entered Rwanda during Opération Turquoise, which was ostensibly to provide a safe zone for those escaping the genocide but was also alleged to be in support of the Hutu-dominated interim government, RTLM broadcast from Gisenyi, calling on &#x27;you Hutus girls to wash yourselves and put on a good dress to welcome our French allies. The Tutsis girls are all dead, so you have your chance.&#x27;

When the Tutsi-led RPF army won control of the country in July, RTLM took mobile equipment and fled to Zaire with Hutu refugees.

==Individuals associated with the station==

=== Presenters/&quot;animateurs&quot; ===

*Kantano Habimana, popularly known as &quot;Kantano&quot;. The most popular &quot;animateur&quot; in terms of airtime, Kantano called for &quot;those who have guns [to] immediately go to these cockroaches [and] encircle them and kill them...&quot;
*Valérie Bemeriki, the only female &quot;animateur&quot;. Bemeriki was known for her calls for machete violence; unlike Kantano, who called for the use of firing squads, Bemeriki told listeners to &quot;not kill those cockroaches with a bullet — cut them to pieces with a machete”.
*Noël Hitimana, who was previously an &quot;animateur&quot; at Radio Rwanda before getting fired for insulting President Juvénal Habyarimana on-air while intoxicated.
*Georges Ruggiu, a white man from Belgium of Italian descent who, after moving away from home at age 35 to work in Liège, came in contact with a Hutu man from Rwanda. After meeting President Juvénal Habyarimana, he would visit and eventually move to Rwanda a year before the genocide. At RTLM, Ruggiu preached Hutu Power despite his non-Rwandan origins, urging listeners to kill Tutsis and told listeners that &quot;graves were waiting to be filled&quot;.
*Froduald Karamira, the vice president of the MDR. Formally coined the term &quot;Hutu Power&quot;. Gave daily broadcasts encouraging the mass murder of Tutsis and oversaw roadblocks where massacres occurred. Executed in 1998.

=== Other figures of note ===
*Félicien Kabuga, &quot;Chairman Director-general&quot; or &quot;President of the General Assembly of all shareholders&quot;. A multimillionaire who was close friends with President Juvénal Habyarimana, Kabuga funded many Hutu ultranationalist media outlets.
*Ferdinand Nahimana, director. A respected historian who received his doctorate from the University Paris Diderot, Nahimana joined RTLM after being fired from Radio Rwanda in 1993.
*Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, chairman of the executive committee. Barayagwiza was an important political figure who served as policy director within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time of the Rwandan genocide.
* Gaspard Gahigi, editor-in-chief
* Phocas Habimana, day-to-day manager

==After-effects==
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&#x27;s (ICTR) action against RTLM began on 23 October 2000 – along with the trial of Hassan Ngeze, director and editor of the &quot;Kangura&quot; magazine.

On 19 August 2003, at the tribunal in Arusha, life sentences were requested for RTLM leaders Ferdinand Nahimana, and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza. They were charged with genocide, incitement to genocide, and crimes against humanity, before and during the period of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis.

On 3 December 2003, the court found all three defendants guilty and sentenced Nahimana and Ngeze to life imprisonment and Barayagwiza to imprisonment for 35 years - this was appealed. The Appeal judgment, issued on 27 November 2007 reduced the sentences of all three - Nahimana getting 30 years, Barayagwiza getting 32 and Ngeze getting 35, with the court overturning convictions on certain counts.

On 14 December 2009, RTLM announcer Valérie Bemeriki was convicted by a gacaca court in Rwanda and sentenced to life imprisonment for her role in inciting genocidal acts.

== Cultural references ==
Dramatised RTLM broadcasts are heard in &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;.

In the film &quot;Sometimes in April&quot; the main character&#x27;s brother is an employee of RTLM.
Controversy develops when attempting to prosecute radio broadcasters because of free speech issues.

The film &quot;Shooting Dogs&quot; makes use of recordings from RTLM.

The title of &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Bill Berkeley&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Graves are Not Yet Full&quot; (2001), is taken from a notorious RTLM broadcast in Kigali, 1994: &quot;You have missed some of the enemies. You must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full!&quot;

The Swiss theatre maker Milo Rau &#x27;re-enacted&#x27; an RTLM radio broadcast in his play &quot;Hate Radio&quot;, which premièred in 2011 and featured on the Berliner Festspiele in 2012 (with audience discussion). He also made it into a radio-play and a film and wrote a book about it.

<doc id="1297712" wikidata="Q15166" url="?curid=1297712" title="Central station (MTR)">
<text>Central () is an MTR station located in the Central area of Hong Kong Island. The station&#x27;s livery is firebrick red but brown on the platforms. The station is the southern terminus of the , a stop on the , and connects to Hong Kong station (via an underground passageway), which serves the and the .

The station was originally named Chater Station (due to its location near Chater Road). It was initially conceived to cater to 330,000 passengers daily and was planned to be long – one of the longest stations in the world. More than 200,000 passengers use this station daily. The longest distance between two exits is approximately 700m.

==History==

===Early plans===
Central station was included in the &quot;Hong Kong Mass Transport Study&quot;, a system proposed in September 1967. Together with Western Market station, it was intended to serve as an interchange station for the and Island line. In the recommended system, the Tsuen Wan line would terminate at (in the report also known as Naval Dockyard). The station was originally planned to be located under Des Voeux Road Central between Jubilee Street and Pedder Street.

In 1970, in the &quot;Hong Kong Mass Transit Further Studies&quot;, the station was proposed as two separate but connected stations: Chater station () under Chater Road and Pedder station () under Pedder Street), which would serve the Kong Kow line (now Tsuen Wan line) and Island line respectively.

===Modified Initial System and opening===

Contracts 106 and 809, which consist of the construction of the two stations and tunnels, were awarded to Metro Joint Venture, comprising Hochtief AG, Dragages et Travaux Publics, Gammon (HK) Limited, and Sentab.

The station first opened as Chater station on 12 February 1980 as the terminus of Only a portion of the station came into operation as the Island line had not been opened yet.

The station was named Chater in English but 中環 in Chinese. This would be misleading as many thought that the Chinese name would be 遮打, a transliteration and the Chinese name of the namesake road. 

When the Island line between Admiralty and Chai Wan opened on 31 May 1985, MTR renamed Chater to Central together with the renaming of some other stations on the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines.

The English name of the station was changed to &quot;Central&quot; in 1982.

The construction contract for the station on the Island line was awarded to the Aoki/ joint venture. Construction for the Island line was carried out in early 1983 and connected the new platforms with the original structure. The Island line began servicing Central on 23 May 1986 when it was extended beyond Admiralty to Sheung Wan and the Island line platforms came into service.

=== Island line ===
The construction contract for the station on the Island line was awarded to the Aoki/Tobishima joint venture. Construction for the Island line was carried out in early 1983 and connected the new platforms with the original structure. The Island line began servicing Central on 23 May 1986 when it was extended beyond Admiralty to Sheung Wan and the Island line platforms came into service.

===Passageway to Hong Kong station===
One component of the Airport Core Programme between 1991 and 1998 was a railway connecting the new Hong Kong International Airport to the city centre. To link Central with the nearby Hong Kong station, the southern terminus of the Tung Chung line and the Airport Express, a passageway was built under Connaught Road Central to connect the two stations. The passageway starts at the Pedder Street concourse and was built with a design similar to that of Hong Kong station. The passage connects the paid areas of both stations (particularly from Central to the Tung Chung line of Hong Kong station). There is no unpaid link (though access to the Airport Express line at Hong Kong station from other lines at Central or vice versa requires an out-of-system transfer as the Airport Express line follows a separate fare scheme from the rest of the MTR system).

==Station layout==

Central station has four platforms on three levels.

The top level includes platform 3 and is built beneath Des Voeux Road Central at the intersection of Pedder Street, stretching from World-Wide House to Alexandra House, on the northern side of the road. The platform serves Chai Wan-bound trains on the Island line and this level includes the connecting walkway to Hong Kong station.

The middle level includes platforms 1 and 2 using a shared island. They serve the Tsuen Wan line and were built directly under Chater Road, extending from Des Voeux Road Central to Club Street.

The bottom level, two levels from the top level, is platform 4, for Island line trains in the direction of Kennedy Town.

Passengers from platform 3 transferring to platforms 1 or 2 use the regular escalators on the Chater Road concourse. There are designated escalators from platforms 1 and 2 to platform 4 for the sole purpose of transfer.

The Tsuen Wan line platforms are straight and were built by cut-and-cover. Most of the length of the Island line platforms is the same, although the eastern part (towards ) is curved and the gap is large, as they are located in sections of bored tunnels and have the curved walls typical of most other stations on the Island line.

The end of the Admiralty stabling siding shared by Tsuen Wan and Island lines is located below the Tsuen Wan line platforms.

==Entrances and exits==
Central station stretches underneath Chater Road from Statue Square in the east and underneath Des Voeux Road to Li Yuen Street East in the west. The distance between the easternmost and westernmost exits is approximately 700m. There are 13 entrances, connecting buildings, shopping malls, main roads and ground transport facilities nearby.

Two other albums – &quot;An Evening with Il Divo: Live in Barcelona&quot; (2009) and &quot;Live in Japan&quot; (2014) – presented recordings of live concerts. The group has also collaborated with multiple other musical artists, with Barbra Streisand and Lea Salonga being examples.

Both the group&#x27;s concerts and its studio releases are known for featuring a variety of languages. Examples include media in French (such as with &quot;Pour Que Tu M&#x27;aimes Encore&quot;), in Italian (such as with &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot;), and in Spanish (such with &quot;Isabel&quot;), with most of Il Divo&#x27;s performances involving the Romance languages. The vocalists have additionally attracted notice due to their public image; for instance, they have almost exclusively worn suits by Giorgio Armani during their concerts and other social affairs.

Since its inception, Il Divo has enjoyed significant commercial success, with the group selling over thirty million copies of their albums worldwide as of 2018. An Australian news article has noted that, &quot;[w]hile other copycat&quot; type &quot;bands were formed after Il Divo’s success&quot;, &quot;most [of them] have split&quot; and additionally Il Divo stands out due to the vocalists proactive choices in managing their output, such as with the tenor Miller directing the music video for their song &quot;Hola&quot;. With 160 certified gold and platinum hits in 35 countries, the group has pioneered the genre of operatic pop, or &quot;popera&quot;, in classical crossover music.

Il Divo&#x27;s live concerts sold over two million concert tickets worldwide just from the group&#x27;s first four albums. In its first world tour, concerts in 69 cities in 18 countries were sold out.

==Members==
Il Divo was composed of four singers: former child performer, television and recording artist, and classical baritone Carlos Marin, born in Germany but raised in Spain; two classically trained tenors, Urs Bühler from Switzerland, and David Miller from the USA; and pop singer-songwriter Sébastien Izambard, from France. After Marín&#x27;s death in late 2021, fellow baritone Steven LaBrie, from the US, joined the band as a special guest on tour before being announced as a full-time member of the group on 17 August 2023.

==Conception and name==
The idea behind Il Divo came when Simon Cowell, inspired after listening to the Three Tenors, decided to form a multinational quartet of talented young singers to recreate the quality of Luciano Pavarotti, José Carreras, and Placido Domingo. Cowell searched worldwide for young singers who were willing to embark on the project from 21 January 2001, to 16 December 2003, when Miller was signed. Prior to Il Divo, each member enjoyed moderate success individually.

==Career==

==Artistry==

===Styling===
Besides music, the members of Il Divo are also known for their refined and elegant appearance, wearing almost exclusively suits by Giorgio Armani (Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Collezioni).

===Musical style===
Il Divo changed the genre of opera with their musical combination of opera singing and classical music, with themes of different genres, including Latin, folk, ballads, church music, bolero and pop.

===Multilingual===
Il Divo records their songs in several languages: Spanish (&quot;Regresa A Mí&quot;, &quot;Hasta Mi Final&quot;, &quot;La Vida Sin Amor&quot;), English (&quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&quot;), Italian (&quot;Senza Parole&quot;, &quot;Passerà&quot;, &quot;Notte Di Luce&quot;), French (&quot;Pour Que Tu M&#x27;Aimes Encore&quot;, &quot;Le Temps des Cathedrales&quot;), Latin (&quot;Panis Angelicus&quot;), Portuguese (&quot;Volta Pra Mim&quot;), and Japanese (&quot;Furusato&quot;). Some songs incorporate more than one language in the same song, such as &quot;The Man You Love&quot; (Spanish and English), &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (Italian and Latin), and &quot;I Believe In You&quot; (English &amp; French), whereas others are recorded in a single language, but sung live in two languages: &quot;She&quot; (Italian &amp; English) and &quot;Bring Him Home&quot; (English &amp; Spanish).

Most of the songs that they cover are reinterpreted from English and translated into the Spanish language, as the group have said that &quot;Spanish is the language of Romanticism&quot;.

==Other activities==
===Philanthropy===
On 25 April 2007, Il Divo performed on &quot;American Idol&quot; in one of the &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; episodes, which raised money for children in the US and Africa. For every vote cast during that show, Idol sponsors Coca-Cola, AT&amp;T, and others donated money to the Charity Projects Entertainment Fund and other groups such as Save the Children and America&#x27;s Second Harvest.

In 2011, they recorded &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; to raise money for the organisation Save the Children.

Il Divo is related indirectly in terms of sponsorship and help with the French NGO SMTA Assistance Médicale Toit du Monde since 2005, of which Izambard is the international official sponsor, and with Sanfilippo Children&#x27;s Foundation, for which Izambard is the global ambassador.

Between 20 and 30 September 2015, Miller and Bühler participated in a motorbike ride from Miami to Los Angeles to raise funds for the Nordoff Robbins music therapy charity.

<text>Dayton&#x27;s was an American department store chain founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1902 by George Draper Dayton. It operated several local high-end department stores throughout Minnesota and the Upper Midwest for almost 100 years. Although it was regionally known as a high-quality shopping destination, Dayton&#x27;s is best remembered for starting the discount shopping chain Target. The company was also instrumental in the history of shopping malls, opening the first indoor shopping mall in the United States—Southdale Center in Edina, Minnesota, in 1956. 

In 1969, Dayton&#x27;s merged with Michigan department store chain Hudson&#x27;s to form the Dayton-Hudson Corporation. The Target division of the company eventually grew so large that in 2000 the corporation was renamed the Target Corporation. Dayton-Hudson had acquired Chicago-based Marshall Field&#x27;s in 1990 and Target rebranded Dayton&#x27;s stores as Marshall Field&#x27;s stores in 2001 in an effort to focus more on discount retailing. In 2004, Marshall Field&#x27;s was purchased by May Department Stores, which subsequently merged in 2005 with Macy&#x27;s, turning the remaining Marshall Field&#x27;s stores into Macy&#x27;s department stores. 

For most of its history, Dayton&#x27;s was owned and operated by the Dayton family. The company&#x27;s mark on Minnesota remains with three Twin Cities shopping malls created by Dayton&#x27;s, Southdale, Rosedale, Ridgedale, with the original location still standing.

==History==

===Goodfellow &amp; Company===
Dayton&#x27;s has roots in R.S. Goodfellow &amp; Company, a dry goods business founded as Goodfellow and Eastman in 1878. George Draper Dayton constructed a six-story building at Nicollet Avenue and Seventh Street in 1902 and convinced Goodfellow&#x27;s, then the fourth-largest department store in Minneapolis, to become the tenant. Designed by Charles Sedgwick, the building made of brick, iron, plate glass, pressed brick and terra cotta, was one of the largest buildings in the city and had all of the latest displays and innovations, including passenger and freight elevators.
 The Goodfellow&#x27;s store opened June 24, 1902, and Reuben Simon Goodfellow retired shortly before, selling his interest to Dayton, who financed and partnered with George Loudon, F.H. Carleton, and J.B. Mosher to run the business.

===Dayton&#x27;s Dry Goods===
By 1903, George Dayton had bought out one partner and renamed the store Dayton&#x27;s Dry Goods Company. At this time, the company stated it would be known as Dayton&#x27;s. After the name change was completed, Dayton&#x27;s operations were handled by George Dayton along with his son, Draper Dayton, and J.B. Mosher. Mosher left the company in December 1905. In 1911, the name was changed again to The Dayton Company.

==Dayton&#x27;s==
Dayton&#x27;s officially became The Dayton Company in 1911, and also purchased the property at Nicollet and Eighth Street in downtown Minneapolis to expand Dayton&#x27;s retail footprint. By 1929, the downtown location consisted of three buildings: the original building from 1902 and two additions from 1913 and 1929, totaling about a million square feet.

Draper Dayton died unexpectedly at the age of 43 in 1923. Dayton&#x27;s founder, George Draper Dayton, died in 1938; and his surviving son, George Nelson Dayton, succeeded him as president of the company.

===1940s and 1950s===
Expanding its downtown Minneapolis location in 1947, Dayton&#x27;s added four floors to the existing eight-story building, bringing the total retail space to 12 floors, at a cost over $2 million (~$ in ).

In 1949, on the hunt for new and different items for its clientele, Dayton&#x27;s accepted several &quot;Cootie&quot; games on consignment from its inventor, Minnesota resident William &quot;Herb&quot; Schaper. The games sold very well, and reorders were placed. Dayton&#x27;s sold 5,500 Cootie games between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and the Game of Cootie was on its way to becoming a classic.

Dayton&#x27;s president George Nelson Dayton died at the age of 63 in 1950, 12 years after becoming president. One of the five sons of George Nelson Dayton, Donald C. Dayton, was named president of Dayton&#x27;s at that time, thus becoming the third-generation family member with the Dayton surname to helm the department store. George Nelson Dayton&#x27;s five sons each inherited 20% of the business after the death of their father; all are credited with managing and expanding Dayton&#x27;s into the modern retail era, along with the creation of Target Corporation, changing the dynamics of retail in not only Minnesota but also nationwide.

In August 1952, Dayton&#x27;s announced the acquisition of Knowlton Company in downtown Rochester, Minnesota. Knowlton had been in business since 1848, and became Dayton&#x27;s second store; thus the beginning of Dayton&#x27;s establishing itself as a department chain store company. After almost two years of expansion and renovations, the Rochester Dayton&#x27;s opened in March 1954.

Dayton&#x27;s pending development of its first shopping center, Southdale Center, was announced in June 1952. Southdale was planned, conceived, constructed, and owned by the Dayton Company. Southdale became the first fully enclosed, climate-controlled shopping mall in the United States, changing the retail landscape. Dayton&#x27;s purchased 500 acres in Edina, Minnesota, to construct the historic $10 million (~$ in ) complex, which opened in 1956 with around 50 shops. 40,000 visitors attended the grand opening of the mall and immediately its success exceeded all expectations. Southdale became Dayton&#x27;s third store; it was the company&#x27;s second location and first in a series of shopping centers in the Twin Cities.

In November 1954, Dayton&#x27;s announced it had acquired Fantle Bros. Department Store in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. This marked the first purchase and location for a Dayton&#x27;s-owned store outside of Minnesota, but it kept the Fantle name instead of converting to the Dayton&#x27;s nameplate.

In 1955, Dayton&#x27;s announced the acquisition of land in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, for a shopping mall. Before the opening of Southdale Center, Dayton&#x27;s was planning to construct a second shopping center called Northdale, but the name was changed to Brookdale. Brookdale was not scheduled to be constructed immediately.

In June 1958, Dayton&#x27;s announced plans with the Radisson Hotels, adjacent to the downtown store, to construct a joint parking ramp for customers and guests of both companies and downtown visitors in general. The ramp was constructed to accommodate 750 cars, which did not make it the largest in town, but was designed for quick and convenient accessibility for patrons to both properties.

Also in 1958, Dayton&#x27;s merged with Schuneman&#x27;s Department Store in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Dayton&#x27;s also announced it had acquired choice retail property in downtown St. Paul to construct a new store in the future. The Dayton&#x27;s-Schuneman&#x27;s store continued operations in the Schuneman&#x27;s building. Schuneman&#x27;s was thought to have annual sales of $12-$15 million at the time, while Dayton&#x27;s was thought to be around $80 million. By early 1960, Dayton&#x27;s owned all property on the block fronted by Wabasha, Cedar, and 6th and 7th Streets in St. Paul.

===1960s===
In February 1962, after acquiring additional property needed to expand in St. Paul, Dayton&#x27;s announced the plans for a new five-story building and parking ramp for 650 cars, all located in one structure.

Brookdale Center opened in Brooklyn Center in March 1962. Planned before the successful opening of Southdale Center, Brookdale was the second shopping center developed by Dayton&#x27;s, and further expanded its retail footprint into the growing suburbs. Dayton&#x27;s was to construct and open a 195,000 sq ft Dayton&#x27;s store at Brookdale in phase two of construction, opening in July 1966.

The new St. Paul store opened in August 1963 with 380,000 sq ft of retail space in five stories, taking up an entire city block. The estimated cost of the new project was $14 million. The old Dayton&#x27;s-Schuneman building across the street was razed for new development.

By 1964, Dayton&#x27;s had become the second-largest privately owned department-store chain in the country, with sales estimated to be at least $130 million (~$ in ) annually.

Dayton&#x27;s announced its third shopping center development in 1966, Rosedale Center. The name continued the convention of &quot;Dale&quot; with the complex located in Roseville, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul. Rosedale Center opened in August 1969 and became the location of the sixth Dayton&#x27;s store. This large Dayton&#x27;s location had three stories, employed more than 600 people, and had 190,000 sq ft of retail space.

Fantle&#x27;s Department Store in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was sold by Dayton&#x27;s, 13 years after purchasing it in 1967. Fantle&#x27;s had never converted to the Dayton&#x27;s name, and Dayton&#x27;s said the reason for the sale was that the company wanted to concentrate on stores in major metropolitan areas. However, Dayton&#x27;s returned to Sioux Falls with a store bearing its own nameplate 11 years later.

In the &#x27;60s, Dayton&#x27;s was one of the first retailers to recognize the buying power of the teen market, and it aggressively pursued it with youth-oriented merchandise, concerts, and attractions. From 1962 to 1966, it hosted a weekly teen dance with live music in the 8th-floor auditorium, attracting up to 5,000 teens per week. In 1966, it spearheaded a &quot;Super Youthquake&quot; movement at area Dayton&#x27;s stores featuring the latest fashions and music, with artists including Simon &amp; Garfunkel and The Yardbirds. The Yardbirds&#x27; appearance at Dayton&#x27;s was the first U.S. tour date played by Jimmy Page. Dayton&#x27;s efforts paid off, and in 1965, it won &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine&#x27;s award for outstanding youth retail. Dayton&#x27;s captured and enjoyed a trendsetter reputation, which contributed greatly to its success and standing apart from other area retailers.

In August 1967, Dayton&#x27;s changed its name to &quot;The Dayton Corporation&quot;, added outside members to its board (increasing the board to 12 persons), and prepared for its first public stock offering. The Dayton family still owned an estimated 85% of the corporation&#x27;s stock after the initial public offering in October of that year, and still owned 43% of the stock by 1977.

The 1960s closed with the merger of The Dayton Corporation and J.L. Hudson (Hudson&#x27;s) of Detroit, Michigan. At the time of acquisition, J.L. Hudson was the nation&#x27;s largest independently owned department-store company. Upon realization of the merger, Dayton Hudson Corporation became the 14th-largest nonfood retailer in the U.S., with combined sales over $800 million.

====Target Stores====
In an announcement made in July 1961, Dayton&#x27;s entered a new era of shopping with a discount store chain to operate separately from Dayton&#x27;s department stores. The new chain constructed stores in the Twin Cities area, and each store featured about 125,000 sq ft of retail space. This move was the first by a department store chain in the upper Midwest to enter the discount retailing field. Named Target, the new stores would become the model for continued success by U.S. retailers, in a class by itself, even as it approached its 60th anniversary. Its success was so great that, in time, Target Corporation survived Dayton&#x27;s, the original parent company.

The first Target store opened in May 1962 in Roseville, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota. Rapidly expanding, by the end of the year there were four Target stores, with locations in Roseville, Crystal, Duluth, and St. Louis Park, Minnesota.

====B. Dalton====
B. Dalton Booksellers was announced in April 1966 as a new book-store chain to be launched and wholly owned by Dayton&#x27;s. After research, Dayton&#x27;s believed book stores would be a successful merchandising field for the company, due in part to the increase in education and disposable income of Americans. Named after Bruce Dayton, the head of Dayton&#x27;s at the time (and one of George Nelson Dayton&#x27;s five sons), Dayton&#x27;s intent from the beginning was for B. Dalton to be a national book-store chain, with locations across the U.S. In 1966, the average book-store chain&#x27;s retail footprint per store was roughly 2,500–2,900 sq ft; B. Dalton&#x27;s first store was to be 7,200 sq ft. In August 1966, the first B. Dalton Bookseller, in the Dayton-owned Southdale Center in suburban Edina, opened. Expansion developed quickly, with the next store in the chain opening in February 1967 in St. Louis, Missouri; another six stores were planned at that time.

==Dayton Hudson Corporation Years==
===1970s===
The bombing of the women&#x27;s restroom at the St. Paul store occurred in 1970. Another, larger bomb was found nearby, but failed to detonate. A juvenile, 15 years old at the time of the bombing, was convicted of the crime.

Ridgedale, the fourth of the Dayton&#x27;s &quot;Dales&quot; shopping centers in the Twin Cities, along with a Ridgedale Dayton&#x27;s store, were announced in January 1972, amid concern over what was described as &quot;an ecologically destructive project.&quot; After pressure by environmental groups, Dayton&#x27;s moved ahead with construction, but shelved plans to further develop a new road by the property, and agreed to a moratorium on further development in the area until at least 1980. The shopping center, along with the new Dayton&#x27;s store, opened in July 1974, and became the final &quot;Dale&quot; location.

Dayton&#x27;s moved its Rochester store from downtown to Rochester&#x27;s new Apache Mall in 1972. The mall had been open for a short time when Dayton&#x27;s decided to leave the downtown area and construct a new 150,000 sq. ft. store at the mall. At that time, Apache Mall was the third-largest shopping center in Minnesota and the largest outside of the Twin Cities area. Dayton&#x27;s move was considered a tipping point in the movement of retail commerce away from downtown Rochester.

Previously announced in 1971, the first Dayton&#x27;s store outside of Minnesota opened in August 1973 in Fargo, North Dakota. The $5 million store was one of the anchors of the newly constructed West Acres Shopping Center, contained about 100,000 sq ft of retail space, and employed close to 200 people.

Crossroads Center in St. Cloud, Minnesota, opened in 1966 with Sears and J.C. Penney as anchors. The shopping center underwent an expansion in 1976, adding an additional 200,000 sq ft of retail space, resulting in the inclusion of a new Dayton&#x27;s store, marking its entrance in the St. Cloud market. The St. Cloud Dayton&#x27;s store opened in July 1976.

Dayton&#x27;s agreed in 1973 to join the planned Homart Development Company&#x27;s Burnsville Center shopping center project to be built in Burnsville, Minnesota. This was an unusual plan of action for Dayton&#x27;s, as this would be its first location in a Twin Cities area shopping center not developed, owned, or managed by Dayton Hudson Corporation. The 180,000 sq ft Burnsville store became Dayton&#x27;s 10th location when it opened in July 1977.

In September 1976, Dayton-Hudson Corporation announced the development of a new shopping center and Dayton&#x27;s store to be built in Grand Forks, North Dakota. This was the company&#x27;s first shopping center to be developed and constructed in North Dakota. The Columbia Mall (Grand Forks) opened in 1978, and while Dayton-Hudson remained at the mall, the company did not own the shopping center for long, selling it one year later.

Dayton&#x27;s had not owned a store in Sioux Falls since selling Fantle&#x27;s Department Store in 1967. In 1977, Dayton&#x27;s announced the construction of a new Sioux Falls store, which would become the first with the Dayton&#x27;s nameplate in South Dakota. The Sioux Falls market was chosen for a Dayton&#x27;s location based on the familiarity of the Dayton&#x27;s name with area residents, and because 1,500 Dayton&#x27;s credit-card account holders resided in the area, though the closest Dayton&#x27;s was about 250 miles away. The new Dayton&#x27;s location contained about 100,000 sq ft of retail space and $3 million (~$ in ) in inventory when it opened at the Empire Mall in July 1978. It was also a unique store for Dayton&#x27;s because it did not have the larger furniture, drapery, and carpet departments like its Minnesota counterparts, and was considered Dayton&#x27;s most forward store in design and décor at the time of its opening.

In 1978, Bob Dayton, son of former Dayton&#x27;s president Donald Dayton, walked away from his executive position to purchase a competing retailer, Harold, located just down the street on Nicollet Mall from Dayton&#x27;s flagship store in Minneapolis. Harold was a high-end women&#x27;s retailer in Minneapolis, and had been experiencing declining sales in recent years, due in part to previous absentee ownership. Bob Dayton had grown bored at Dayton&#x27;s and was excited by the opportunity to purchase Harold, and go head-to-head against the business his great grandfather founded. Besides owning Harold, he also developed The Conservatory, a retail shopping center on Nicollet Mall directly across the street from Dayton&#x27;s, and which was ultimately deemed a failure and demolished. Harold went out of business in 1990.

Dayton&#x27;s continued to expand and announced its fifth shopping center, and first Wisconsin Dayton&#x27;s store, in 1978. This would be its first shopping center to be built outside Minnesota, and would be located in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Valley View Mall (La Crosse, Wisconsin) opened in July 1980, with Dayton&#x27;s as one of the four anchor stores.

In March 1978, Dayton&#x27;s relocated its Home Store from Southdale Center to a newly constructed store nearby, also in Edina. This was unusual in that the Dayton&#x27;s Home Store was no longer located within the same mall as the Dayton&#x27;s store.

===1980s===
Kenneth Dayton, the last of the five Dayton brothers still affiliated with Dayton&#x27;s, responsible for leading and guiding the company through the modern era, announced his retirement in June 1983. His retirement resulted for the first time in the company&#x27;s history that a Dayton family member would no longer be employed by Dayton&#x27;s.

Dayton&#x27;s third North Dakota store was announced in November 1984. The store, located in Bismarck, North Dakota, at the Kirkwood Mall, was the site of a former F.W. Woolworth Company, later Woolco. The Bismarck store opened on August 1, 1985.

Dayton&#x27;s was a trendsetter in the marketing of exclusive plush animals available during the holiday season. In 1985, it introduced Santabear, a toy bear so hugely popular that it generated $300 million (~$ in ) in sales within nine years. Its success inspired other retailers such as Macy&#x27;s, Walmart, and Dayton&#x27;s sibling Target Corporation to introduce their own holiday plush animals to bring customers into their stores during the holidays.

In July 1988, Dayton&#x27;s announced future expansion by building larger stores for its Southdale and Rosedale locations, the first Dayton&#x27;s construction since the opening of the Bismarck store in 1985. This expansion was seen as a response to the planned Mall of America to be constructed in nearby Bloomington, Minnesota. The new Dayton&#x27;s stores were to be constructed next to the existing stores, which would be renovated to accommodate 50 new retailers at Southdale and 30 new retailers at Rosedale.

===1990s===
In April 1990, Marshall Field&#x27;s was acquired from Batus Inc. by the department-store division of the Dayton–Hudson Corporation in a $1.04 billion (~$ in ) deal. The new ownership planned to retain the Marshall Field&#x27;s name, as it was well-known and well-respected.

Dayton&#x27;s again expanded into Wisconsin, and opened a new store in August 1991 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, at Oakwood Mall. After previously announcing its intentions in 1988, Dayton-Hudson also opened a new Dayton&#x27;s in the summer of 1991 in Appleton, Wisconsin, at Fox River Mall, after closing a nearby Marshall Field&#x27;s location.

With the opening of the nearby Mall of America in 1992, Dayton&#x27;s is thought to have struck a deal with Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc, the owners of both Southdale Center and Rosedale Center. In exchange for Dayton&#x27;s agreement to stay put at both malls and not defect to the Mall of America, Equitable gave Dayton&#x27;s $40 million to construct two larger stores at both Southdale and Rosedale, and Dayton&#x27;s gave Equitable its two old stores, which were renovated into mall space.

Dayton&#x27;s new location opened at Southdale Center in August 1990. The new location was 370,000 sq ft, four stories, and featured many modern amenities, replacing the older, smaller original Dayton&#x27;s location. The new 260,000 sq ft Rosedale counterpart opened in the summer of 1991.

For the first time since 1978, when the Edina Home Store opened, Dayton&#x27;s opened a new store in the Twin Cities. The new location opened at Maplewood Mall in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood in October 1996. The store was located in the former Carson&#x27;s space, one of the eight area Carson&#x27;s spaces purchased by Dayton&#x27;s in a $74 million (~$ in ) cash deal in 1995 following the closure of the Twin Cities Carson&#x27;s locations.

Another remodeled former Carson&#x27;s property at Ridgedale Center was opened as a Dayton&#x27;s location. This property became Dayton&#x27;s second location at Ridgedale, housing the men&#x27;s and home stores. Dayton&#x27;s had been cramped at Ridgedale for years, so it was seen as advantageous to expand into two locations at the same mall; also, it was seen as a strategic move to keep Nordstrom out, as that company appeared to be interested in Ridgedale Center. Nordstrom eventually opened at the mall.

==Target Corporation==
Dayton-Hudson Corporation announced in January 2000 a name change to Target Corporation. Acknowledging that Target stores made up 80% of its revenue and that the Target name was better known nationally, Dayton-Hudson believed Target was the name, and direction, of the corporation&#x27;s future. Taking on the name of one of its brands was considered unusual for a corporation, but Target had been Dayton-Hudson&#x27;s top revenue producer for 23 years, and the corporate name change was met with enthusiasm by investors.

==Name change==
In January 2001, much to the dismay of shoppers in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit, Dayton&#x27;s and Hudson&#x27;s were rebranded with the Marshall Field&#x27;s nameplate, which has a higher national profile. This change was viewed as a strategic move and deemed necessary in the Internet age to create a unified presence. Dayton&#x27;s popular sales events - Daisy Sale in summer and Jubilee Sale in fall, were renamed &quot;Field Days&quot; after 2001. The first sign of the name change came with the discontinuation of the Dayton&#x27;s website in favor of the Marshall Field&#x27;s site in May 2001. The demise of the Dayton&#x27;s name in favor of the Marshall Field&#x27;s nameplate occurred later in 2001, and affected the existing Dayton&#x27;s stores, including eight in the Twin Cities, one in St. Cloud, one in Rochester, three in North Dakota, one in South Dakota, and three in Wisconsin.

==Sale and final name change==
After rumors dating back to 1995 that May Department Stores was interested in Dayton&#x27;s, in 2004, Target Corporation announced the sale of the Marshall Field&#x27;s department store group, including the 62 stores serving communities in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin, to May Department Stores. Target sold off its Mervyn&#x27;s stores in a $1.65 billion (~$ in ) deal to a private investment fund in 2004. (Mervyn&#x27;s went bankrupt in 2008).

In February 2005, May Department Stores merged with Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy&#x27;s, in an $11 billion (~$ in ) deal. Later that year, in September, Marshall Field&#x27;s stores were announced to be taking the Macy&#x27;s name, ending the run of Marshall Field&#x27;s – and the then-still freshly renamed Dayton&#x27;s and Hudson&#x27;s – as unique, upscale Midwestern department-store brands.

In 2017, Macy&#x27;s announced that the Dayton&#x27;s downtown Minneapolis flagship store, rebranded as Marshall Field&#x27;s in 2001, and Macy&#x27;s in 2006, would close, ending an era. Its final day of business was March 19, 2017, closing the book on more than a century of retail at that location. The building was purchased for $40 million by 601W Cos., an investment firm with a history of remodeling and reselling refurbished skyscrapers. In an innovative redevelopment of the property, with a nod to the past, it has been converted into &quot;The Dayton&#x27;s Project&quot;, a mixed-use retail, office space, and entertainment complex with some of the original Dayton&#x27;s elements restored, while being redesigned for the 21st century.

<doc id="1297743" wikidata="Q957943" url="?curid=1297743" title="National Revolutionary Movement for Development">
<text>The National Revolutionary Movement for Development (, MRND) was the ruling political party of Rwanda from 1975 to 1994 under President Juvénal Habyarimana, running with first Vice President Édouard Karemera. From 1978 to 1991, the MRND was the only legal political party in the country. It was dominated by Hutus, particularly from President Habyarimana&#x27;s home region of Northern Rwanda. The elite group of MRND party members who were known to have influence on the President and his wife are known as the akazu. In 1991, the party was renamed the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (, MRND or MRNDD).

Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, the party was banned.

==History==
The party was established by Habyarimana on 5 July 1975, exactly two years after he had ousted the first post-independence president Grégoire Kayibanda in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Habyarimana established a totalitarian state and banned the Parmehutu party, which had been dominated by Hutus from southern Rwanda. The MRND replaced Parmehutu as the sole legally permitted party in Rwanda. A new constitution was approved in a 1978 referendum. It codified the MRND&#x27;s status as the only legal party, and declared that every Rwandan citizen was automatically a member of the MRND.

Presidential elections were held in 1978 with Habyarimana as the sole candidate. He was re-elected with 99% of the vote. Parliamentary elections followed in 1981, with two MRND candidates contesting each of the 64 seats. Habyarimana was re-elected again in 1983 and 1988, whilst parliamentary elections were held under the same system in 1983 (with the National Assembly enlarged to 70 seats) and 1988.

The party&#x27;s name was changed after the legalisation of opposition parties in 1991. The youth wing of the party, the &quot;interahamwe&quot;, later developed into a militia group that played a key role in the Genocide against Tutsi. After Habyarimana&#x27;s death in April 1994, hardline elements of the party were among the chief architects of the genocide; the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which played a significant role, was originally a hard-line faction of the MRND that became a separate party.

After Rwanda was conquered by the rival Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front led by Paul Kagame, both the MRND and the CDR were driven from power and banned in July 1994.

==Ideology==
Habyarimana was described as relatively moderate, though he (and his regime) are said to have used propaganda methods, ethnically discriminating against the Tutsi (albeit less extreme than their predecessors), advanced a conservative social agenda and were anti-communist.

==Structure==
Habyarimana was the president of the party, and as such was the only candidate for president of the republic. However, in a minor concession to democracy, voters were presented with two MRND candidates at Legislative Assembly elections.

<doc id="1297752" wikidata="Q745009" url="?curid=1297752" title="The Beekeeper (album)">
<text>The Beekeeper is the eighth studio album by American musician Tori Amos. It was released on February 20, 2005, through Epic Records and is her second release for the label. As with many of Amos&#x27; releases throughout the 2000s, &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; is a concept album, heavily inspired by the practice of beekeeping and its connection to femininity and female empowerment. The album&#x27;s nineteen tracks are separated into six different &quot;gardens&quot; (denoted in the booklet of the limited edition of the album), and are inspired by topics such as her experiences with motherhood (&quot;Ribbons Undone&quot;), betrayal (&quot;Witness&quot;), and Christian mythology (&quot;Marys of the Sea&quot;).

&quot;The Beekeeper&quot; continues the stripped-back approach of Amos&#x27; previous album &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; (2002), now with strong elements of soul music, augmented by guest vocals from the London Community Gospel Choir and Amos&#x27; use of the Hammond B-3 organ. Supporting musicians on the album include frequent collaborators Matt Chamberlain on drums, Jon Evans on bass, and Mac Aladdin on guitar. Live performance was emphasized during the recording sessions, rather than having musicians record their parts separately using overdubs.

The album was a success upon its release, reaching the top five in the US and receiving generally positive reviews from critics, although some criticism was directed at its length and production. &quot;Sleeps with Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Sweet the Sting&quot; were released as singles to promote the album, with the former reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Alternative Airplay chart (her second-highest position on the chart to date). The album was supported by the Original Sinsuality and Summer of Sin tours, which ran from May through July and August through September of that year, respectively. Similar to &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot;, a double-disc limited edition of &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; was released, containing a bonus DVD with the extra track &quot;Garlands&quot; and a mini-documentary about the album&#x27;s songs and a &quot;Beekeeper Mix&quot; packet of wildflower seeds.

==Background==

After the release of the covers album &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot; in 2001, Amos left Atlantic Records for Epic to release &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot;. A primary motivation for the label switch was the company&#x27;s president Polly Anthony. Amos felt Anthony would commit to promoting her work properly, something she felt Atlantic had not done with her recent releases. However, with Anthony&#x27;s resignation in 2003 and Epic&#x27;s merger with BMG Entertainment, she ended up in a similarly frustrating position.

Like many of Amos&#x27; releases throughout the 2000s, &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; is a concept album. Alongside the inspiration from beekeeping, female spirituality and the experiences of women in Christianity play a large role, particularly in songs such as &quot;Original Sinsuality&quot; and &quot;Marys of the Sea&quot;. Songs from the album are separated into six different &quot;gardens&quot;, detailed in the limited edition booklet: &quot;roses and thorns&quot;, &quot;herbs and elixirs&quot;, &quot;the greenhouse&quot;, &quot;the desert garden&quot;, &quot;the orchard&quot;, and &quot;the rock garden&quot;.

During the writing of the album, Amos was concurrently writing her first book, &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; with journalist Ann Powers, which goes into detail about the background of many tracks appearing on &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; along with other songs from her discography.

==Recording==

&quot;The Beekeeper&quot; was recorded throughout 2004 at Martian Engineering Studios in Cornwall, England, with the mixing handled by Amos&#x27; husband Mark Hawley and Marcel van Limbeek. The album was self-produced. In addition to Chamberlain, Evans, and Aladdin, the London Community Gospel Choir appears on the tracks &quot;Sweet the Sting&quot;, &quot;Mother Revolution&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, and &quot;Hoochie Woman&quot;.

Special emphasis was put on recording the tracks live in lieu of recording various parts separately and using overdubs. In some instances, multiple keyboard instruments would be recorded within the same take; the piano stool was positioned in between Amos&#x27; piano and Hammond organ, allowing her to switch between the two without the need for separate takes.

== Music and lyrics ==

 The opening track, &quot;Parasol&quot;, takes inspiration from Georges Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Seated Woman with a Parasol (Study for &quot;La Grande Jatte&quot;)&quot;. The song depicts a woman who is exiting a relationship with a controlling partner. She now has to confront herself and her experience to be able to recover from said relationship. &quot;Sweet the Sting&quot; is a primary example of the album&#x27;s soul influence, enhanced by the prominent vocals of the London Community Gospel Choir and Amos&#x27; Hammond B-3 organ. Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; was a significant influence on the track. &quot;The Power of Orange Knickers&quot; features vocals from Irish singer-songwriter Damien Rice. The track was written as a response to frequent use of the word &quot;terrorist&quot; (particularly after the September 11 attacks) and to those who twist the term for their own personal or political gain. Amos wrote the lyrics with the intention of &quot;undressing&quot; the word and finding a more basic and universal definition for it.

&quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; features mandolin playing by Mac Aladdin. The song took inspiration from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name, and stories from Cornwall locals of ships running aground and being looted by wreckers. &quot;Barons of Suburbia&quot; features extensive use of mixed meter, alternating between , , and . The song reportedly took months to write, with the pre-chorus taking shape much earlier than the rest of the track. &quot;Sleeps with Butterflies&quot; continues the theme of nature and pollination-themed imagery. Much like portions of the previous track, its chorus took months for Amos to complete, eventually coming as a spur-of-the-moment creation on the piano. &quot;General Joy&quot; was written in July 2004 and criticizes the war on terror. &quot;Mother Revolution&quot; concerns the concept of mothers suffering the deaths of their children in global conflict. As Amos said in a 2005 interview with &quot;Uncut&quot;: &quot;what I find really disturbing about this global war, is you don&#x27;t see any of the world leaders sending their children to be butchered. It&#x27;s always someone else&#x27;s children, someone else&#x27;s blood.&quot; &quot;Ribbons Undone&quot; was inspired by Amos&#x27; daughter Natashya. &quot;Cars and Guitars&quot; features prominent upright bass playing by Evans and was inspired by the concept of a woman reaching an emotional breaking point and driving away to abandon her family.
&quot;Witness&quot;, a song described as being about betrayal, also heavily features elements of soul music. &quot;Original Sinsuality&quot; is a solo piano-and-vocal performance. The song gave its name to the album&#x27;s supporting tour and was used as the opening song in each of its shows. Amos stated the song &quot;suggests it&#x27;s not sin you find in the garden, it&#x27;s original sinsuality&quot;, a term created to represent a situation in which her character is encouraged to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, rather than being dissuaded from it. &quot;Ireland&quot; exerts a reggae influence and was inspired by writer James Joyce. The album&#x27;s title track was originally written after Amos&#x27; mother had suffered a medical emergency, and later took on new meaning after the passing of Amos&#x27; brother in a car accident: &quot;I was drawn to the idea that in a bee colony, the drones are the ones that go first. I thought that it was nature&#x27;s parallel for the loss of this man before his time.&quot; &quot;Martha&#x27;s Foolish Ginger&quot; is a track which Amos has said to have worked on over a period of several years, having created its title and written its chorus while struggling to finish the song until being inspired by a trip to San Francisco during her 2003 Lottapianos tour.

&quot;Hoochie Woman&quot; continues the soul-influenced theme of prior tracks combined with various percussive elements. Inspired in part by a book entitled &quot;Sextrology&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Pisces&quot; portrays the end of a relationship with lyrics influenced by astrological signs and ages. &quot;Marys of the Sea&quot; was heavily inspired by a translation of &quot;The Gospel of Mary Magdalene&quot; with commentary from Jean-Yves Leloup. Amos wrote the song with the intention of including multiple different sides to the story of Mary Magdalene; both as her being part of the sacred marriage, but also tackling the sexist attitudes towards women held by Saint Peter, Paul the Apostle, and many hailing from early Orthodox Christian tradition. The piano riff for the song&#x27;s verse was written prior to the section&#x27;s melody or lyrics; Amos said that while writing the song, she came up with &quot;about seventeen [melodies] that I sing in the shower&quot; before finding the right one to use. Amos also cited the tale of Melusine, a figure in European folklore described as having the upper-half of a woman and lower-half of a fish or serpent (similar to a mermaid), as an inspiration for the song. The album&#x27;s closer, &quot;Toast&quot;, was written in dedication to Amos&#x27; late brother. &quot;Garlands&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Washington Square&quot;) is a bonus track only available on the limited edition DVD.

== Promotion and release ==

Photography for the packaging of &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; was done by Kevin Mackintosh, with art direction handled by Sheri Lee and Dave Bett. It became the first of Amos&#x27; albums to not have any commercial physical single releases. Rather, &quot;Sleeps with Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Sweet the Sting&quot; were released to radio stations on promotional CDs and were available to stream online for the public. &quot;Sleeps with Butterflies&quot; peaked at number four on the US Triple A chart, her second-highest peak on the chart behind the previous album&#x27;s &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;, which peaked at number two. Amos promoted the track with various television appearances, including on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Weekend Today&quot;.

&quot;The Beekeeper&quot; was released in various territories through February 20–22, 2005. It reached a peak position of number five in the US, becoming her fifth top ten album. As with &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot;, a limited edition double-disc version of &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; was released, containing a DVD with the bonus track &quot;Garlands&quot; and a mini-documentary on the album entitled &quot;The Beekeeper: A Walk Through the Gardens&quot; and a &quot;Beekeeper Mix&quot; packet of wildflower seeds.

&quot;Sweet the Sting&quot; and &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; later appeared on the 2006 boxset &quot;A Piano: The Collection&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;The Beekeeper&quot; received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. While much of the material was praised, many critics felt the album was overproduced and overly long. Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album&#x27;s second half, highlighting the &quot;harrowing starkness&quot; of &quot;Original Sinsuality&quot; and the title track&#x27;s electronic elements, but found its length &quot;frustrating&quot; and stated that &quot;with some ruthless editing and remixing, this maddeningly uneven eighty-minute disc could have been her best in ages.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; rated the album 6 out of 10, naming &quot;Toast&quot;, &quot;Parasol&quot;, &quot;General Joy&quot;, and &quot;Original Sinsuality&quot; (the latter in particular) as highlights, yet derided &quot;Sleeps with Butterflies&quot;, &quot;Hoochie Woman&quot;, and &quot;Ireland&quot; and stated that the album&#x27;s production and arrangements led to it sounding like &quot;a collection of outtakes from a much better album.&quot;

Keith Phipps of &quot;the A.V. Club&quot; was critical of much of the album. While he did praise &quot;Parasol&quot;, he felt most of the album &quot;floats by without stirring much interest&quot;.
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album 3.5 stars out of 5. He praised the album&#x27;s sense of cohesion, stating it &quot;flow[s] with the grace and purpose of a song suite&quot;, and calling it &quot;an ambitious, restless work that builds on her past work without resting on her laurels.&quot;

===Aftermath===

Amos has gone on to express disappointment about the album&#x27;s stripped-back arrangements. She described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;no make-up, no airbrush, no nothing&quot;, going on to refer to it as &quot;not one of my favourite records because of that.&quot; Subsequently, Amos would apply a band-centric ethos to &quot;American Doll Posse&quot; (2007) and a heavy emphasis on arrangements for &quot;Abnormally Attracted to Sin&quot; (2009) in contrast with the approach of &quot;The Beekeeper&quot;.

== Tour ==

Two tours were held in promotion of &quot;The Beekeeper&quot;: the Original Sinsuality Tour, which ran through the spring and early summer of 2005, and the Summer of Sin Tour, which occurred in August and September that same year. Each show featured songs from &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; alongside tracks from Amos&#x27; previous albums, with a &quot;Tori&#x27;s Piano Bar&quot; segment in the middle of the main set consisting of a couple covers of songs by a wide range of artists. Aside from &quot;Original Sinsuality&quot;s permanent spot as the show-opener, each show contained a unique setlist as is typical of Amos&#x27; shows. Amos was joined by the London Community Gospel Choir during the June 4 show, appearing on &quot;Mother Revolution&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Sweet the Sting&quot;, and &quot;Hoochie Woman&quot;. The shows, particularly those from the Summer of Sin Tour, were positively received.

Select shows from the tours were released as a series of six live albums entitled &quot;The Original Bootlegs&quot;. The first five shows came from the Original Sinsuality Tour whilst the final volume came from an August show from the Summer of Sin Tour. Saratogian.com praised the August 23 performance at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, calling it &quot;magical&quot; and praising her lively stage presence and setlist choices. &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; called the September 6 concert at the USANA Amphitheatre &quot;smoldering&quot; and gave particular praise to the performance of &quot;Winter&quot;.

<text>Avondale () is one of Chicago&#x27;s 77 officially designated community areas. It is on the Northwest Side of the city. The northern border is Addison Street from the north branch of the Chicago River in the east to Pulaski Road in the west. The neighborhood extends further west along Belmont Avenue to the Union Pacific/Northwest Line. Its southern border is Diversey Avenue from the Union Pacific/Northwest Line to the Chicago River.

==History==
The first European settler in Avondale was Abraham Harris who settled the area three years after its 1850 incorporation into Jefferson Township. In 1869, Avondale was incorporated as a village. It has been speculated that developer and Pennsylvania native John Lewis Cochran named the village in honor of the miners and rescue workers who died in the Avondale coal mine fire. Atypical for the time, Avondale was racially integrated in the nineteenth century with twenty African American families moving to the area and building Avondale&#x27;s first church in the 1880s. Avondale, along with the rest of Jefferson Township, was annexed by the City of Chicago in 1889.

Factories and other industries sprang up around the start of the 20th century due to the Chicago River and Avondale&#x27;s dense network of transportation corridors that were built in the 1870s and improved after its annexation into Chicago including replacement of cable cars with electric powered streetcars. The resulting jobs in the area were responsible for drawing the initial wave of European immigrants.

Avondale was the site of one of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Seven Lost Wonders&quot;, the Olson Park and Waterfall complex at Diversey and Pulaski.

Beginning in the 1980s, Latino settlement began in Avondale. A multiplicity of other diverse Eastern European ethnicities came to the area following the End of Communism in 1989, leading to Avondale&#x27;s nickname as the neighborhood &quot;Where Eastern Europe meets Latin America&quot;.

Starting in the mid-2000s, gentrification began to take hold in the Avondale area as it had in neighboring Wicker Park, Logan Square and Bucktown.

==Demographics==

Avondale has traditionally had a large Polish population, with patches of German, Scandinavian, and Italians settlement as well. In recent years this blue-collar neighborhood has witnessed an increase in its social diversity. The collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe witnessed an influx of Eastern European immigrants such as Czechs, Slovaks, Ukrainians and Belarusians, particularly alongside Poles in the &quot;Polish Village&quot;. The emigration of peoples from the Soviet Bloc in Avondale since then has grown to include Russophone nationals from Central Asia and even Mongolia. A strong Filipino community is present in Avondale as well, which is home to Chicago&#x27;s Filipino TV outlet. Latino settlement beginning in the 1980s led to an increase in Avondale&#x27;s Hispanic population from 37.6% in 1990 to 62.0% in 2000, with increased numbers of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Central American immigrants. Because of gentrification, the last decade has seen a reversal of this trend, as the non-Hispanic white population has been expanding faster than the Hispanic population.
==Transportation==
Avondale is served by the &#x27;L&#x27; at two stations along the Blue Line. The station is on the northeastern edge next to the Kennedy Expressway at the intersection of Kimball Avenue and Belmont, less than three blocks away from St. Hyacinth&#x27;s former mission of Our Lady of Lourdes; the station is located in the median of the same expressway adjacent to the neighboring Villa District.

Avondale is also accessible by a number of bus routes run by the CTA.

==Neighborhoods==
===Polish Village===

The Polish Village or Jackowo and Wacławowo , together make up one of Chicago&#x27;s largest and most vibrant &quot;Polish Patches&quot;. The neighborhoods derive their Polish names from the two contiguous Polish Roman Catholic parishes- Saint Hyacinth&#x27;s Basilica (&quot;Bazylika Św. Jacka&quot;) and St. Wenceslaus Church (&quot;Kościół Świętego Wacława&quot;). Milwaukee Avenue is the district&#x27;s main commercial strip, which includes a number of sausage shops, restaurants, and bakeries. In English the area is usually referred to as the Polish Village - the name featured on signs hung on street lamps over the district. Pulaski Avenue, named after the Polish Revolutionary War hero, runs through the area.

The Polish communities of Jackowo and Wacławowo appeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Polish settlement spread further northwest along Milwaukee Avenue. The neighborhood experienced its heyday as the cultural nexus of Chicago&#x27;s Polonia during the 1980s and 1990s with the so-called Solidarity and Post-Solidarity waves of Polish migration to Chicago, including a number of political refugees. Until the recent installation of an automated system, on Sunday mornings the CTA driver would announce &quot;Yats- koh- voh&quot;, signaling the stop for St. Hyacinth Basilica as Poles shuttled off the bus on their way to Mass. Local landmarks and institutions increasingly became revitalized and renewed while taking on an increasingly ethnic hue by catering to these recent arrivals from Poland. The historic Milford Theatre served as the central Polish cinema arts venue like Jefferson Park&#x27;s Gateway Theater today, with locals giving it the nickname &quot;Cinema Polski&quot;, drawing even street photographer Vivian Maier.

A distinct flowering of Polish arts and culture took place here in Avondale, an environment where Poles could finally freely express themselves without worrying about incurring the wrath of government censors or political repression. The events and activities organized here by Chicago&#x27;s Polish community played a key role in shaping the chain of events that eventually resulted in the collapse of the Communist government in Poland, bringing down the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since after World War II. An expressive and now decaying mural in the McDonald&#x27;s parking lot combining Polish patriotic and folkloric motifs by Caryl Yasko titled &quot;Razem&quot;, or together in Polish, was painted thanks in part to funds furnished by the Polish American Congress in 1975. It now stands near the corners of Belmont and Pulaski in mute testament to this bygone renaissance.

Just to the north of Jackowo is Wacławowo and the parish of St. Wenceslaus, with its impressive church. Housing stock there primarily consists of brick two-flats built in the first half of the 20th century prior to World War II, although there are a number of bungalows present in the area neighboring the Villa District to the north.

===Belmont Gardens===
Belmont Gardens spans the Chicago Community Areas of Logan Square and Avondale like neighboring Kosciuszko Park, located within its northwest portion, where the Pulaski Industrial Corridor abuts these residential areas. The boundaries of Belmont Gardens are generally held to be Pulaski Road to the East, the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line to the West, Belmont Avenue to the North, and Fullerton Avenue to the South.

Most of the land between Fullerton Avenue and Diversey Avenue as well as Kimball Avenue to the Union Pacific/Northwest rail line was empty as late as the 1880s, mostly consisting of the rural &quot;truck farms&quot; that peppered much of Jefferson Township. This began to change with the annexation of this rustic hinterland to the city in 1889 in anticipation of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition that would focus the country&#x27;s eyes on Chicago just a few years later in 1893.

Belmont Gardens&#x27;s first urban development began thanks to Homer Pennock, who founded the industrial village of Pennock, Illinois. Centered on Wrightwood Avenue, which was originally laid out as &quot;Pennock Boulevard&quot;, was planned to be a hefty industrial and residential district. The development was so renowned that the village was highlighted in a &quot;History of Cook County, Illinois&quot; authored by Weston Arthur Goodspeed and Daniel David Healy. Thwarted by circumstances as well as the decline of Homer Pennock&#x27;s fortune, this district declined to the point that the Chicago Tribune wrote about the neighborhood in an article titled &quot;A Deserted Village in Chicago&quot; in 1903. The original name of the Healy Metra Station was originally named after this now lost settlement.

While Homer Pennock&#x27;s industrial suburb failed, Chicago&#x27;s rapid expansion transformed the area&#x27;s farms into clusters of factories and homes. At the start of the 20th century as settlement was booming, Belmont Gardens and Avondale were at the Northwestern edge of the Milwaukee Avenue &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;- a contiguous stretch of Polish settlement which spanned this thoroughfare all the way from Polonia Triangle at Milwaukee, Division and Ashland to Irving Park Road.

Belmont Gardens offered more than just a less congested setting for its new residents. Due to its proximity to rail along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, the area developed a plethora of industry that still survives in the city&#x27;s Pulaski Industrial Corridor. It was adjacent to his own factory that Mr. Walter E. Olson built what the Chicago Tribune put at the top of its list of the &quot;Seven Lost Wonders of Chicago&quot;, the Olson Park and Waterfall Complex, a 22-acre garden and waterfall remembered by Chicagoans citywide as the place they fondly reminisce heading out to for family trips on the weekend. The ambitious project took 200 workers more than six months to fashion it out of 800 tons of stone and 800 yards of soil.

Latino settlement in the neighborhood began in the 1980s. Today the area still retains its blue collar feel as much of surrounding Logan Square and Avondale undergo increased gentrification.

===Kosciuszko Park===

Kosciuszko Park spans the Chicago Community Areas of Logan Square and Avondale like neighboring Belmont Gardens, located within its northwest portion, where the Pulaski Industrial Corridor abuts these residential areas. Colloquially known by locals as &quot;Koz Park&quot;, or even the &quot;Land of Koz&quot;, the area is a prime example of a local identity born thanks to the green spaces created by Chicago&#x27;s civic leaders of the Progressive Era.

The boundaries of Kosciuszko Park are generally held to be Central Park Avenue to the East, Pulaski Road to the West, George Street to the North, and Altgeld to the South.

Most of the land between Fullerton Avenue and Diversey Avenue as well as Kimball Avenue to Pulaski Road was empty as late as the 1880s, mostly consisting of the rural &quot;truck farms&quot; that peppered much of Jefferson Township. This began to change with the annexation of this rustic hinterland to the city in 1889 in anticipation of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition that would focus the country&#x27;s eyes on Chicago just a few years later in 1893.

Kosciuszko Park&#x27;s first urban development began thanks to Homer Pennock, who founded the industrial village of Pennock, Illinois. Centered on Wrightwood Avenue, which was originally laid out as &quot;Pennock Boulevard&quot;, was planned to be a hefty industrial and residential district. The development was so renowned that the village was highlighted in a &quot;History of Cook County, Illinois&quot; authored by Weston Arthur Goodspeed and Daniel David Healy. Thwarted by circumstances as well as the decline of Homer Pennock&#x27;s fortune, this district declined to the point that the Chicago Tribune wrote about the neighborhood in an article titled &quot;A Deserted Village in Chicago&quot; in 1903.

While Homer Pennock&#x27;s industrial suburb failed, Chicago&#x27;s rapid expansion transformed the area&#x27;s farms into clusters of factories and homes. At the start of the 20th century as settlement was booming, Kosciuszko Park and Avondale were at the Northwestern edge of the Milwaukee Avenue &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;- a contiguous stretch of Polish settlement which spanned this thoroughfare all the way from Polonia Triangle at Milwaukee, Division and Ashland to Irving Park Road.

Kosciuszko Park offered more than just a less congested setting for its new residents. Due to its proximity to rail along the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, the area developed a plethora of industry that still survives in the city&#x27;s Pulaski Industrial Corridor.

Adjacent to Kosciuszko Park&#x27;s border with Avondale proper near the intersection of George Street and Lawndale Avenue is St. Hyacinth Basilica, which began in 1894 as a refuge for locals to tend to their spiritual needs. A local shrine, St. Hyacinth&#x27;s features relics associated with Pope John Paul II, as well as an icon with an ornate jeweled crown that was blessed by the late pontiff. Other institutions further enriched the institutional fabric of the Polish community in the area. In 1897, the Polish Franciscan Sisters began building an expansive complex on Schubert and Hamlin Avenues with the construction of St. Joseph Home for the Aged and Crippled, a structure that would also serve as the motherhouse for the order. When it opened in 1898, it became the city&#x27;s first and oldest Catholic nursing home. One of the industries the nuns took upon themselves to support these charitable activities was a church vestment workshop which opened in 1909 on the second floor. In 1928 the Franciscan Sisters further expanded the complex by building a new St. Joseph Home of Chicago, a structure that stood until recently at 2650 North Ridgeway. Designed by the distinguished firm of Slupkowski and Piontek who built many of the most prestigious commissions in Chicago&#x27;s Polish community such as the Art Deco headquarters of the Polish National Alliance and Holy Trinity High School among others, the brick structure was an imposing edifice. One of the building&#x27;s highlights was a chapel with an altar that was dedicated to the Black Madonna. The entire complex was sold to a developer who subsequently razed the entire complex, while the new &quot;St. Joseph Village&quot; opened in 2005 on the site of the former Madonna High School and now operates at 4021 W. Belmont Avenue. The park later became home to one of the two first Polish language Saturday schools in Chicago. While the school has since moved out of their small quarters at the park fieldhouse, the Tadeusz Kościuszko School of Polish Language continues to educate over 1,000 students to the present day, reminding all of its origins in Kosciuszko Park with its name.

It was the park of Kosciuszko Park however that weaved together the disparate subdivisions and people into one community. Dedicated in 1916, Kosciuszko Park owes its name to the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko. Best known as the designer and builder of West Point, Kosciuszko fought in the American Revolution and was awarded with U.S. citizenship and the rank of brigadier general as a reward. Kosciuszko was one of the original parks of the Northwest Park District which was established in 1911. One of the ambitious goals of the Northwest Park District that was in keeping with the spirit of the Progressive Movement popular at the time was to provide one park for each of the ten square miles under its jurisdiction. Beginning in 1914, the district began to purchase land for what would eventually become Mozart, Kelyvn, and Kosciuszko Parks, and improvement on these three sites began almost immediately. For Kosciuszko, noted architect Albert A. Schwartz designed a Tudor revival-style fieldhouse, expanded in 1936 to include an assembly hall, just two years after the 22 separate park districts were consolidated into the Chicago Park District. The park complex expanded during the 1980s with the addition of a new natatorium at the corner of Diversey and Avers.

The green space afforded by the park quickly became the backdrop for community gatherings. Residents utilized the grounds at Kosciuszko Park for bonfires, festivals and neighborhood celebrations, and for a time, even an ice skating rink that would be set up every winter. Summertime brought the opportunity for outdoor festivities, peppered with sports and amateur shows featuring softball games, social dancing, a music appreciation hour, and the occasional visit by the city&#x27;s &quot;mobile zoo&quot;.

Today &quot;The Land of Koz&quot; is a diverse neighborhood, and becoming even more so as gentrification advances further northwest. New people are entering Kosciuszko Park and joining earlier residents whose roots trace back to Latin America and Poland. Yet the park that lent the neighborhood its name still serves its residents, where through play, performance, and even the occasional outdoor film screening it functions as the venue where the community can come together.

==Economy==
In 1937, Dad&#x27;s Root Beer was founded in Avondale by Ely Klapman and Barney Berns. The company operated a bottling plant in the community before the company moved operations. The factory has since been converted into condominiums.

As of 2014, the top 5 employing industry sectors in Avondale are retail trade (20.9%), manufacturing (14.8%), utilities (12.4%), accommodation and food service (9.8%), and finance (7.4%). Over half of these workers come from outside of Chicago and 45.5% come from outside of Avondale within the city. The top 5 employing industry sectors of community residents are accommodation and food service (11.5%), healthcare (11%), professional (10.1%), retail trade (9.6%), and administration (8.3%).

==Education==
Avondale residents are served by Chicago Public Schools, which includes neighborhood and citywide options for students. There are also a number of private parochial schools run by Roman Catholic congregations in the area.

Carl Von Linne School, 3221 N. Sacramento, on Sacramento between Belmont and School is a neighborhood school. The school features a comprehensive gifted program and a dual language program. There is an emphasis on fine arts including visual arts, ceramic, music, dance, digital arts, and culinary arts. The school has a &quot;sprouting teens garden&quot; on the east side of the building and a &quot;kitchen community culinary garden&quot; in the main playground.

The United Neighborhood Organization operates the Carlos Fuentes School in Avondale.

==Public libraries==
The Chicago Public Library operates no branches located in the Avondale community area. Although the branch in nearby Kosciuszko Park was one of the system&#x27;s most utilized branches, it was closed by the 1950s. Branches are available nearby in adjacent neighborhoods, such as Logan Square, Irving Park, and Belmont Cragin.

==Politics==
The Avondale community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Avondale cast 10,290 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,345 votes for Donald Trump (83.77% to 10.95%). In the 2012 presidential election, Avondale cast 7,940 votes for Barack Obama and 1,415 votes for Mitt Romney (82.43% to 14.69%).

==Parks==
Avondale was cited by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as being in the top tier of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;park poor&quot; neighborhoods. This situation was further aggravated when Avondale Park was reduced to just over one acre in size during the building of the Kennedy Expressway, taking over most of its green space, including the park&#x27;s playfield, separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; playgrounds, a wading pool, a sand box and tennis courts while leaving the fieldhouse designed by Clarence Hatzfeld intact.

The substantial green spaces in the Avondale community area are Brands Park, followed by Avondale Park. Parks adjacent to Avondale such as Kosciuszko Park, Athletic Field Park and Ken-Well Park are heavily utilized by residents as well. Additionally, there are playlots under the supervision of other parks such as Grape Playlot, Park-view Playlot, Nelson Playlot, Elston Playlot, and Sacramento Playlot, found within Avondale.

==Culture==
Avondale has a number of strong and simultaneously diverse cultural centers. St. Hyacinth Basilica continues to be a strong cultural and civic institution for Chicago&#x27;s Polish Community. True to stereotype, the neighborhood &quot;where Eastern Europe meets Latin America&quot; is also home to the new second location of the Puerto Rican Arts Alliance in the former firehouse of Engine 91. The Hairpin Arts Center is located in Avondale near its border with Logan Square at the gateway to Chicago&#x27;s Polish Village, serving all of the diverse communities who make their home in these neighborhoods.

==Pete Soucy==
Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Soucy was born in Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, moved with his family to Gander in 1969, where he attended school before eventually attending NSCAD in Nova Scotia.

Soucy taught High School Visual Arts for five years between 1983 and 1989, four years in Clarenville High School, Clarenville, NL, and one at Bishops College in St. John&#x27;s.

Since 1986, Soucy has been acting, writing, designing, and directing for stage, radio and television. A graduate of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Soucy later taught Visual Arts for several years in secondary schools. His most successful play, &quot;FLUX&quot;, has been adapted for television, published, and performed in several provinces and states.

In 1987, Soucy co-founded the Day Job Theatre. Since then, he has appeared in many television commercials and has completed a three-year term as Artistic Director of Rebel Island Theatre and the NaGeira Theatre Festival in Carbonear.

Soucy unsuccessfully ran for the Liberals in the 1999 provincial election. He lost to Jack Harris, who was leader of the NDP at the time.

Soucy subsequently hosted VOCM&#x27;s Backtalk in St. John&#x27;s, NL.

<text>Political repression is the act of a state entity controlling a citizenry by force for political reasons, particularly for the purpose of restricting or preventing the citizenry&#x27;s ability to take part in the political life of a society, thereby reducing their standing among their fellow citizens. Repression tactics target the citizenry who are most likely to challenge the political ideology of the state in order for the government to remain in control. In autocracies, the use of political repression is to prevent anti-regime support and mobilization. It is often manifested through policies such as human rights violations, surveillance abuse, police brutality, imprisonment, involuntary settlement, stripping of citizen&#x27;s rights, lustration, and violent action or terror such as murder, summary executions, torture, forced disappearance, and other extrajudicial punishment of political activists, dissidents, or the general population. Direct repression tactics are those targeting specific actors who become aware of the harm done to them while covert tactics rely on the threat of citizenry being caught (wiretapping and monitoring). The effectiveness of the tactics differs: covert repression tactics cause dissidents to use less detectable opposition tactics while direct repression allows the citizenry to witness and react to the repression. Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership and by self-censorship within the public.

Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute state terrorism, genocide, politicide or crimes against humanity. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarian states and similar regimes. While the use of political repression varies depending on the authoritarian regime, it is argued that repression is a defining feature and the foundation of autocracies by creating a power hierarchy between the leader and citizenry, contributing to the longevity of the regime. Repressive activities have also been found within democratic contexts as well. This can even include setting up situations where the death of the target of repression is the result. If political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. Some examples are the FBI COINTELPRO operations from 1956 to 1971 and the Palmer Raids from 1919 to1920.

In some states, &quot;repression&quot; can be an official term used in legislation or the names of government institutions. The Soviet Union had a legal policy of repression of political opposition defined in its penal code and Cuba under Fulgencio Batista had a secret police agency officially named the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities. According to Soviet and communist studies scholar Stephen Wheatcroft, in the case of the Soviet Union terms such as &quot;the terror&quot;, &quot;the purges&quot; and &quot;repression&quot; are used to refer to the same events. He believes the most neutral terms are &quot;repression&quot; and &quot;mass killings&quot;, although in Russian the broad concept of repression is commonly held to include mass killings and is sometimes assumed to be synonymous with it, which is not the case in other languages.

== In political conflict ==
Political conflict strongly increases the likelihood of state repression. This is arguably the most robust finding in social science research on political repression. Civil wars are a strong predictor of repressive activity, as are other forms of challenges from non-government actors. States so often engage in repressive behaviors in times of civil conflict that the relationship between these two phenomena has been termed the &quot;Law of Coercive Responsiveness&quot;. When their authority or legitimacy is threatened, regimes respond by overtly or covertly suppressing dissidents to eliminate the behavioral threat. State repression subsequently affects dissident mobilization, though the direction of this effect is still an open question. Some strong evidence suggests that repression suppresses dissident mobilization by reducing the capacity of challengers to organize, yet it is also feasible that challengers can leverage state repressive behavior to spur mobilization among sympathizers by framing repression as a new grievance against the state.

== Violence ==
Political repression is often accompanied by violence, which might be legal or illegal according to domestic law. Violence can both eliminate political opposition directly by killing opposition members, or indirectly by instilling fear.

== Intolerance ==

Political repression is sometimes accompanied by intolerance. This intolerance is manifested through discriminatory policies, human rights violations, police brutality, imprisonment, extermination, exile, extortion, terrorism, extrajudicial killing, summary execution, torture, forced disappearance and other punishments against political activists, dissidents, and populations in general.

== State terrorism ==
When political repression is sanctioned and organized by the state, situations of state terrorism, genocide and crimes against humanity can be reached. Systematic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, totalitarian states and similar regimes. In these regimes, acts of political repression can be carried out by the police and secret police, the army, paramilitary groups and death squads. Sometimes regimes considered the democratic exercise political repression and state terrorism to other states as part of their security policy.

== Direct vs. indirect repression ==
Direct repression is a form of repression where the state targets an opposing political actor by obvious violent action. The target is clearly aware of the harm that is caused to their life and livelihood. Direct repression does not exclusively occur within the boundaries of a state, but also across borders. In personalist dictatorships, initiating conflicts with other states and people outside their own borders is more common because of a lack of accountability via extremely limited or no competitive elections.

Indirect repression relies on the threat of violence which constitutes harassment, intimidation, and administrative blockages. These tactics tend to be non-violent, yet still are built to control citizenry.

== Repressive success and monitoring ==
Individuals indirectly exposed to repression self-report higher trust in the leader and the ruling party. This phenomenon was observed in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe, where the effects of repression increased approaching elections, even with deteriorating social and economic conditions. A large signifier of whether or not repression is successful in a state is evidence of preference falsification– where the preference expressed by an individual in public diverges from their private preference. In North Korea, accused of highly repressive activity in media and public culture, 100% of citizens vote in ‘no choice’ parliamentary elections so the state can identify defectors. Citizens are required to show complete devotion to North Korea&#x27;s current leader and sacrifice their safety if they choose to speak out. Repressive measures including prison camps, torture, forced labor, and threats of execution are just some of the costs of defection. The Chinese Communist Party implements extensive surveillance measures in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, including Internet censorship, camera monitoring, and other forms of mass surveillance. These practices involve technologies such as AI, facial recognition, fingerprint identification, voice and iris recognition, big data analysis, DNA testing, and are closely linked to the Social Credit System in mainland China. At the same time, many domestic Chinese technology companies are also involved in the country&#x27;s large-scale surveillance programs. These primarily include companies such as Hikvision, Sensetime, Huawei, ZTE, and others.

<text>The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYS OPRHP) is a state agency within the New York State Executive Department charged with the operation of state parks and historic sites within the U.S. state of New York. the NYS OPRHP manages nearly of public lands and facilities, including 180 state parks and 35 historic sites, that are visited by over 78 million visitors each year.

==History==
The agency that would become the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYS OPRHP) was created in 1970; however, the history of state parks and historic sites in New York stretches back to the latter part of the 19th century. Management of state-owned parks, and guidance for the entire state park system, was accomplished by various regional commissions, private organizations, statewide advisory councils, and divisions within other state agencies prior to the establishment of NYS OPRHP, which grew from the framework created by these earlier organizations.

===Initial acquisitions===

State-level procurement and management of parks in New York began in 1883, when then-governor Grover Cleveland signed legislation authorizing the appropriation of lands near Niagara Falls for a &quot;state reservation&quot;. Two years later, the Niagara Reservation, known today as Niagara Falls State Park, opened to the public. The park is claimed to be the oldest state park in the United States, and was the first established via eminent domain.

The State Reservation on the St. Lawrence was authorized in 1896. By 1898, it included modest state holdings in the Thousand Islands region of New York. During the early 20th century, the state continued to expand its public parks system with several large additions, including Letchworth State Park in 1906, Fire Island State Park (known today as Robert Moses State Park) in 1908, John Boyd Thacher State Park in 1914, Enfield Glen State Park (today&#x27;s Robert H. Treman State Park) in 1920, and Allegany State Park in 1921. A coordinated effort to protect portions of the Hudson Palisades from the damaging effects of quarrying resulted in the creation of a number of state parks in the 1910s and 1920s, including Bear Mountain State Park and Harriman State Park.

===NYS Council of Parks===
Throughout these early acquisitions, the state lacked a formal statewide agency or organization to coordinate management and development of state parks. Instead, parks were managed by independent regional commissions, such as the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, or by organizations such as the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. To address the need for statewide coordination, the New York State Council of Parks was created by legislation adopted on April 18, 1924. The council served to plan development and set standard policies for all New York state-owned parks, reservations, and historic sites that were not under the authority of the New York State Conservation Commission (which notably included those lands that comprised the Forest Preserve in the Adirondacks and Catskills). Its formation was supported by governor Alfred E. Smith and based on plans by Robert Moses, who became the council&#x27;s first commissioner; Moses would remain in charge of the council until 1963.
The council initially included representatives from regional park commissions and other organizations involved in park management, including the Conservation Commission and the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. Prior to the creation of the Division of Parks (see below), the State Council of Parks was the highest-level organization overseeing park management in the state.

Although it later became an advisory body, the council continues to this day, known officially as the New York State Council of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. It includes representatives from the following departments and commissions as of 2014:
*New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation
*New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
*New York State Board for Historic Preservation
*Allegany State Park Commission
*Central State Park Commission
*Finger Lakes State Park Commission
*Genesee State Park Commission
*Long Island State Park Commission
*New York City State Park Commission
*Niagara Frontier State Park Commission
*Palisades Interstate Park Commission
*Saratoga-Capital District State Park Commission
*Taconic State Park Commission
*Thousand Islands State Park Commission
===NYS Conservation Department Division of Parks===
A reorganization of New York&#x27;s state government took place in 1926, which resulted in the creation of the New York State Conservation Department. The newly formed Conservation Department included a Division of Parks which assumed responsibility for management of New York&#x27;s parks and historic sites. The Council of Parks continued as a constituent unit of the Division of Parks. The council was also at this time given the additional responsibility of planning highway improvements to enable access to park facilities.
Although the Great Depression of the 1930s reduced available funding for New York&#x27;s state parks, the period was a time of development of existing parks&#x27; facilities. Construction teams comprising workers employed through federal programs such as the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps, Civil Works Administration, and Works Progress Administration cleared woodlands, performed maintenance tasks, and built roads, trails, golf courses, buildings, and furniture for New York&#x27;s parks through the 1930s and early 1940s.

As the Depression came to a close with the United States joining World War II in 1941, New York State was managing 74 parks welcoming a combined 20 million visitors annually. However, the Division of Parks&#x27; responsibilities were reduced in 1944 when 27 State Historic Sites were placed under the jurisdiction of the New York State Education Department. These sites were eventually returned to the Conservation Department in 1966; in the same year, the New York State Historic Trust (which later became the New York State Board for Historic Preservation) was created to help guide their management.
New York&#x27;s park system continued expansion after World War II ended. The creation or completion of various parkways in the state, such as the Palisades Interstate Parkway and Lake Ontario Parkway, received priority during the 1950s. As visitation to New York&#x27;s state parks increased following the war, new lands were sought for state parks, including unsuccessful attempts to expand into the Forest Preserve. Increased funding for parks made available in the 1960s did allow for the purchase of several large tracts throughout the state for parkland development. The state also began at this time to expand into new areas, such as an increase in boating facilities and establishment of parks within New York City.

===NYS Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation===
A major shift in New York&#x27;s park management came in 1970 with legislation that created the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which was tasked with all responsibilities of the former Conservation Department, with the exception of managing the state&#x27;s parks and historic sites outside of the Forest Preserve. The former Division of Parks was upgraded to become an independent agency, known as the New York State Office of Parks and Recreation. Legislation enacted in 1972 gave the agency direct control of New York&#x27;s park lands, with the State Council of Parks and regional commissions retaining an advisory role in management. The agency&#x27;s name was updated in 1981 to its current form, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYS OPRHP).
The state park system underwent a period of rapid expansion during former governor George Pataki&#x27;s administration. Between 1995 and 2007, Pataki, along with then-parks commissioner Bernadette Castro, opened 28 new state parks. Although the governor was lauded as a conservationist for his actions, the new parks increased financial burdens on the NYS OPRHP, whose funding for operations remained steady. In 2010, a statewide fiscal crisis led to an announcement that 55 state parks and historic sites would be closed. The threatened closures were eventually averted, with budget shortfalls made up through reduced staffing and hours at many parks, closure of some internal facilities such as campgrounds and golf courses, and increases in user fees.

The 2010 fiscal crisis resulted in decreased availability of funds for maintenance and upkeep at New York&#x27;s parks. To help address an estimated $1 billion in needed repairs, $143 million in funds were made available in 2012; the money came from a combination of state, federal, and private grant sources. Sustained funding for repairs was announced in 2015, with the state planning to spend $900 million by 2020 at parks and historic sites throughout the state.

<text>Trimmatom nanus, the midget dwarfgoby, is a species of marine goby native to the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. It can mainly be found on oceanic drop-offs at depths of from though it can occasionally be found in outer reef areas and lagoons at depths of from . This species can reach a length of SL.

&quot;T. nanus&quot; was until 2004 the smallest known fish and vertebrate. The recent discovery of &quot;Schindleria brevipinguis&quot; (called the stout infantfish) relegated it to second place. Later, the discovery of &quot;Paedocypris progenetica&quot; dropped &quot;T. nanus&quot; to third place. The record for the smallest known vertebrate being held by the frog &quot;Paedophryne amauensis&quot;, formally described in January 2012.

<text>The provinces of Sierra Leone are divided into 16 districts, as of July 2017. Previously, the country was divided into 14 districts. The Western Area is divided into two districts. Sierra Leone&#x27;s capital Freetown is located in the Western Area of the country and its makes up the Western Area Urban District.

One traditional leader from each district occupies a seat in Sierra Leone&#x27;s parliament. Each one of Sierra Leone&#x27;s sixteen administrative districts (with the exception of the Western Area Urban District) is governed by a directly elected district council headed by a council chairman. The national capital Freetown, which makes up the Western Area Urban District, and the other is the Western Area Rural with a main town known as Waterloo, is governed by a directly elected city council headed by a mayor. The districts are further divided into a total of 190 (prior to 2017, 149) chiefdoms, whose elected leaders provided most of local government from 1896 to 2004, when they were supplemented by elected local councils.

<text>Jesse Michaels (born April 1, 1969) is an American songwriter, painter, illustrator, musician, singer, and author from Berkeley, California. His lyrics deal with politics, racism, and general social issues. He is most well known as the vocalist for the ska punk band Operation Ivy (1987–1989), as well as Classics of Love (2009–approx. 2012). In 2023 Michaels formed the band DOOM Regulator. He is the son of the author Leonard Michaels, and was married to producer Audrey Marrs.

==Early life==
Jesse Michaels was born in 1969 and he grew up in Berkeley, California, his parents are professor Priscilla Older and professor and writer Leonard Michaels.

In Berkeley he became involved with the local punk and hardcore music scene in the eighties. As a very young participant, he attended performances by many formative punk and hardcore bands. The Bay Area was also home to a small but enthusiastic second wave ska scene and Michaels was exposed to much two tone ska music, including performances by Berkeley&#x27;s The Uptones. Michaels&#x27; early musical experimentation involved playing in garage bands including a primitive collaboration with Jeff Ott and Aaron Cometbus who would later go on to form the band Crimpshrine.

Throughout the eighties he was involved with the publication of fanzines, including 1987&#x27;s Kill Deal for 50 Cents.

He was married to Audrey Marrs.

== Music ==
In 1987 he formed the band Operation Ivy with guitarist Tim Armstrong, bassist Matt Freeman, and drummer Dave Mello. They quickly became a popular band especially at the Berkeley punk club 924 Gilman Street. In 1987, the group released its debut extended play &quot;Hectic&quot; on which Michaels wrote all of the lyrics. It was followed with an American tour which brought the group&#x27;s work all around the country, and made Operation Ivy a very well respected band. Operation Ivy recorded and released its only studio album &quot;Energy&quot; in 1989 and broke up the same year. Michaels also co-wrote the music to the Green Day song &quot;2,000 Light Years Away&quot; from their second album &quot;Kerplunk&quot; (1992). He later formed Big Rig in 1994. Big Rig released one extended play and played several gigs around 924 Gilman Street before breaking up.

In 1999 after a long hiatus he formed Common Rider with Squirtgun bassist and producer Mass Giorgini. They released two albums and toured around the country before breaking up in 2003. In August 2008, Jesse went on a short Southern California tour with long-time friend Jeff Ott, playing new solo songs.

In December 2008, he participated in a small Northern California tour with Mike Park and Kevin Seconds, as well as formed a new band, Classics of Love. Michaels has stated in interviews and biographical material that the reason for his sporadic / intermittent involvement with music is that he does not consider himself a full-time musician, instead preferring to play music as an avocation rather than a career.

Michaels collaborated with former Operation Ivy bandmate Tim Armstrong for the 2013 original song, &quot;Living In A Dangerous Land&quot; as part of the Tim Timebomb And Friends series.

In March 2023, Michaels and Tim Armstrong along with Circle Jerks drummer Joey Castillo and Trash Talk bassist Spencer Pollard formed the band Bad Optix and released their first single called &quot;Raid&quot;. Armstrong promised tons more songs to come. Less than a week after announcing the formation of the band, the band changed their name to DOOM Regulator due to a band from Seattle already being called Bad Optics.

== Visual artwork ==
In 1996, Michaels graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he received a BA degree in Literature. He is no longer an active musician, he cites punk music as a formative aesthetic influence and continues to direct his creative energies towards film, literature and visual art.

Michaels is also regarded as a talented artist, responsible for designing Operation Ivy&#x27;s well-known and widely recognized &quot;Ska Man&quot; logo as well as other artwork for the album. In addition to drawing logos, album covers and other assorted art for his own musical projects, his artwork has been used by bands such as Filth, Neurosis, Green Day (for the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;39/Smooth&quot;) and Against All Authority.

Michaels has recently been making reprints of sketches and other art available for sale on eBay on a limited basis. As an oil painter, Michaels has exhibited his work around the West Coast.

In 2005, Jesse collaborated with Chris Appelgren of Lookout! Records to launch Dynaformer, an art/design collective dedicated to showcasing the artwork of both individuals, as well as offering their artistic talents for hire. Although Dynaformer was short-lived, Michaels and Apelgren continue to collaborate. In 2013 the pair teamed up to produce the cover of Michaels&#x27; debut novel as well as creating an EP design for a solo record by Murder City Devils&#x27; Spencer Moody. In 2015, Jesse sang on the track &quot;System Fucked&quot; featured on the Leftöver Crack album &quot;Constructs of the State&quot;.

== Publications ==

Michaels has expressed an interest in writing. In a 2010 interview, he told Jewcy magazine, &quot;I have written one book. It&#x27;s a novella and I&#x27;m sort of shopping it around and it might get published this year.&quot; The book was originally titled &quot;What The Dead Have To Say&quot; but Michaels received interest from Soft Skull Press, an independent imprint which is known for bridging the gap between literary fiction and fringe cultural interests. Soft Skull agreed to publish Michaels&#x27; novel but the title was changed to, &quot;Whispering Bodies: A Roy Belkin Disaster&quot;. The book was released in September 2013. &quot;Whispering Bodies&quot; is a comic novel about a recluse who is forced to enter the world at large to clear the name of a woman who he believes has been falsely accused of a crime.

<text>The Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science is the University of Miami&#x27;s academic and research institution for the study of oceanography, atmospheric, and earth sciences. The Rosenstiel School is located east from the University of Miami&#x27;s main Coral Gables campus on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida, United States.

Founded in 1943, the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School is the only subtropical applied and basic marine, atmospheric, and earth research institute in the continental United States. The school is also home to SUSTAIN, the world&#x27;s largest hurricane simulation tank.

Up until 2008, Rosenstiel School was solely a graduate school within the University of Miami, though it jointly administrated an undergraduate program with the University of Miami&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences. In 2008, Rosenstiel School launched an undergraduate program, granting both Bachelor of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science (BSMAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Marine Affairs (BAMA) undergraduate degrees and Master&#x27;s degrees. Doctorate degrees are awarded to Rosenstiel School students by the University of Miami&#x27;s Graduate School.

The Rosenstiel School&#x27;s research includes the study of marine life, including aplysia and coral, climate change, tropical cyclones, air-sea interactions, coastal ecology, and oceanography law. The school operates a marine research vessel and has a research site at an inland sinkhole.

==History==


In 1940, University of Miami president Bowman Foster Ashe recruited F.G. Walton Smith, a British marine biologist who was working in the Bahamas to join the University of Miami&#x27;s Department of Zoology and develop of a marine laboratory at the university.

In 1943, the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami established the Marine Laboratory for the University. They invited researchers and oceanographers to associate themselves with the laboratory whose three original objectives were teaching, basic research, and applied marine research. The laboratory focused on subjects specific to a tropical environment. Initially, the Marine Lab was located in a private boathouse on an estate on Belle Isle in Miami Beach. In 1945, when the boathouse became structurally unsafe, the lab moved to a converted apartment building in Coral Gables, Florida near the main campus.

In 1947, a delegation from Dade County prompted the Florida State Legislature to support development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the State Board of Conservation, which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time. The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in St. Petersburg.

Since 1951, the School has published the &quot;Bulletin of Marine Science&quot;, a peer-reviewed scientific journal on ecology, fisheries management,geology, geophysics, marine biology, oceanography, meteorology, and related topics.

In 1953, the School&#x27;s classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed Institute of Marine Science in 1961, it became part of the University of Miami&#x27;s School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences.

In 1969, the institution was made into an independent school and named to honor Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel after a major contribution from Rosenstiel&#x27;s foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences.

In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami&#x27;s College of Arts &amp; Sciences. The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated Pew Institute for Ocean Science as a joint venture with the Pew Charitable Trusts; in 2008, the program relocated to Stony Brook University on Long Island.

In 2008, the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School took over administration of the university&#x27;s undergraduate Marine Science, Marine Affairs, and Meteorology programs.

Also in 2008, the school&#x27;s library merged with the central University of Miami Library. Recently, the Rosenstiel School started unique a one-year Master of Professional Science degree program aimed at students planning non-research careers in business, government, or non-profit organizations.

In June 2022, the faculty voted to change the name of the school to the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, reflecting the strengths in geosciences as well as the ocean and atmospheric sciences.

==Academics==
While the graduate programs are conducted by Rosenstiel School faculty who report to the dean of the Rosenstiel School, the University of Miami&#x27;s Graduate School awards the school&#x27;s graduate degrees. Rosenstiel School offers a joint program with the University of Miami School of Law, which awards its students both a Juris Doctor degree and a Master of Arts in Marine Affairs and Policy. The school also administers the University of Miami&#x27;s undergraduate programs in marine science, marine affairs, and meteorology on the university&#x27;s main Coral Gables campus.

The Rosenstiel School is divided into five academic departments:
* Atmospheric Sciences
* Environmental Science and Policy
* Marine Biology and Ecology
* Marine Geosciences
* Ocean Sciences

In addition to its academic departments, Rosenstiel School has several research units: Oceans and Human Health Center, National Resource for &quot;Aplysia&quot;, National Center for Coral Reef Research, Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS), and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. , 358 professors and scientists conduct research programs and teach at Rosenstiel School and the University of Miami&#x27;s main campus. Of these, 81 are regular full-time faculty members.

The school operates &quot;F.G. Walton Smith&quot;, a research vessel. Designed to meet the school&#x27;s specifications, the catamaran was put on water in 2000. It is equipped with a special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.

Rosenstiel School&#x27;s research invertebrate museum houses one of the world&#x27;s most extensive collections of invertebrate tropical marine life with 400,000 specimens. It includes Atlantic tropical marine invertebrates. The collection consists of 60,000 specimen lots, out of which 38,900 are cataloged and identified species.

Since 2005, Rosenstiel School has conducted an underwater photography contest that draws international submissions. It also makes underwater photographs available through its Digital Atlas of Marine Species and Locations, which is a database that includes photos of specific marine species.

Since 1951, Rosenstiel School has published &quot;Bulletin of Marine Science&quot; a scientific journal which publishes research papers in marine subject areas covered by the school. It is published four times a year.

The United States National Research Council ranked graduate research programs based on 2008 data, and the Rosenstiel School ranked 11th to 40th among Oceanography, Atmospheric Sciences, and Meteorology Rankings. Rosenstiel School entering graduate students&#x27; average quantitative Graduate Record Examination score was 681.

==Campus==
The University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School&#x27;s Virginia Key campus includes classroom facilities, laboratories, a dock, and a student center. The center, called F. G. Walton Smith Commons, holds a cafeteria and a bar (aka &quot;the wet lab&quot;) that was rated as one of Miami&#x27;s best secrets by &quot;Miami New Times&quot; in 2008. The campus features mangroves, sea grape trees, and dune plants to protect its sand dunes and the campus from storm damage. In 2009, UM received a $15 million federal grant to help construct a new $43.8 million, Marine Technology and Life Sciences Seawater Research Building. The Virginia Key campus is located at a marine research and education park that is also home to two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research laboratories and the Maritime and Science Technology Academy magnet school.

The school also operates a site on mainland Miami-Dade County that was formerly the United States Naval Observatory Secondary National Time Standard Facility, which already had buildings and a 20M antenna used for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Rosenstiel School&#x27;s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS) and Richmond Satellite Operations Center (RSOC) have research facilities located on what is now named the Richmond Campus.

In the 1990s, the school hosted the Miami Hoshuko, a part-time Japanese school for Japanese citizens and ethnic Japanese people in the area. While there, Miami Hoshuko used ten classrooms, a library, and a cafeteria facility.

==Research==
As of 2008, the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School receives $50 million in annual external research funding. Laboratories at Virginia Key are equipped with specialized instruments including a salt-water wave tank, the five-tank Conditioning and Spawning Systems, multi-tank &quot;Aplysia&quot; Culture Laboratory, Controlled Corals Climate Tanks, and DNA analysis equipment. The Richmond Campus&#x27; CSTARS provides Rosenstiel School with a near-real-time weather satellite downlink. Rosenstiel School also operates Bimini Biological Field Station, an array of oceanographic high-frequency radar along the U.S. east coast, and its Bermuda aerosol observatory.

Research projects at Rosenstiel School are in the domain of atmospheric and marine sciences and include:
*Coral reef research, focusing on corals survival in a new climate conditions; coral reef protection
*Field programs evaluating trace gas chemistry and transport
*The aquaculture program
*Climate change modeling
*Tropical weather, climate, and atmospheric/oceanic circulations
*Air-sea interactions research through buoys, remote sensing, analysis in situ, a wave tank laboratory, numerical modeling;
*Volcanoes in the Pacific, Everglades water level measurements and subsidence through satellite images
*Studies of coastal quality and their impact on human health.

Rosenstiel School&#x27;s Marine Affairs and Policy Division conducts archaeological and paleontological research at Little Salt Spring in Sarasota County. The site was donated to the University of Miami in 1982. Rosenstiel School also hosts the National Center for Coral Reef Research (NCORE), which works to understand, conserve and manage coral reefs worldwide.

Rosenstiel School has focused significant resources to studying the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and its long term environmental effect. The school is an active member of the State of Florida&#x27;s Oil Spill Academic Task Force that works with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on spill issues. In the summer of 2010, a CIMAS team working with the research vessel Walton Smith was able to document a long oil plume extending toward Dry Tortugas.

The quality of the school is evaluated through peer-reviewed competition for faculty research grants. In addition, each year, the National Science Foundation conducts a nationwide student competition for Graduate Research Award Fellowship, and in 2010, five Rosenstiel School students received such awards with two additional honorable mentions.

===Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies===

Since 1977, the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a scientific partnership between the University of Miami and NOAA, has been studying climate change, air-sea interactions and coastal ecology.

<doc id="1297796" wikidata="Q1890958" url="?curid=1297796" title="Oxygen mask">
<text>An oxygen mask is a mask that provides a method to transfer breathing oxygen gas from a storage tank to the lungs. Oxygen masks may cover only the nose and mouth (oral nasal mask) or the entire face (full-face mask). They may be made of plastic, silicone, or rubber.
In certain circumstances, oxygen may be delivered via a nasal cannula instead of a mask.

==Medical plastic oxygen masks==

=== Examples of medical plastic oxygen masks ===
Medical plastic oxygen masks are used primarily by medical care providers for oxygen therapy because they are disposable and so reduce cleaning costs and infection risks. Mask design can determine accuracy of oxygen delivered with many various medical situations requiring treatment with oxygen. 

Oxygen is naturally occurring in room air at 21% and higher percentages are often essential in medical treatment. Oxygen in these higher percentages is classified as a drug with too much oxygen being potentially harmful to a patient&#x27;s health, resulting in oxygen dependence over time, and in extreme circumstances patient blindness. For these reasons oxygen therapy is closely monitored. Masks are light in weight and attached using an elasticated headband or ear loops. They are transparent for allowing the face to be visible for patient assessment by healthcare providers, and reducing a sensation of claustrophobia experienced by some patients when wearing an oxygen mask. The vast majority of patients having an operation will at some stage wear an oxygen mask; they may alternatively wear a nasal cannula but oxygen delivered in this way is less accurate and restricted in concentration.

The global disposable oxygen masks market, according to Altus Market Research, has the potential to grow by US$1.1 billion between 2019 and 2023. The market&#x27;s growth pace will also pick up speed throughout this time.

==Silicone and rubber masks==
Silicone and rubber oxygen masks are heavier than plastic masks. They are designed to provide a good seal for long-duration use by aviators, medical research subjects, and hyperbaric chamber and other patients who require administration of pure oxygen, such as carbon monoxide poisoning and decompression sickness victims. Dr. Arthur H. Bulbulian pioneered the first modern viable oxygen mask, worn by World War II pilots and used by hospitals. Valves inside these tight-fitting masks control the flow of gases into and out of the masks, so that rebreathing of exhaled gas is minimised.

==Hoses and tubing and oxygen regulators==
Hoses or tubing connect an oxygen mask to the oxygen supply. Hoses are larger in diameter than tubing and can allow greater oxygen flow. When a hose is used it may have a ribbed or corrugated design to allow bending of the hose while preventing twisting and cutting off the oxygen flow. The quantity of oxygen delivered from the storage tank to the oxygen mask is controlled by a valve called a regulator. Some types of oxygen masks have a breathing bag made of plastic or rubber attached to the mask or oxygen supply hose to store a supply of oxygen to allow deep breathing without waste of oxygen with use of simple fixed flow regulators.

== Oxygen masks for aviators ==

=== History ===

An early 1919 high-altitude oxygen system used a vacuum flask of liquid oxygen to supply two people for one hour at . The liquid passed through several warming stages before use, as expansion when it evaporated, and absorbed latent heat of vaporization, would make the gasified oxygen so cold that it could cause instant frostbite of the lungs.

The first successful creation for the oxygen mask was by Armenian born Dr. Arthur Bulbulian, in the field of facial prosthetics, in 1941.

Many designs of aviator&#x27;s oxygen masks contain a microphone to transmit speech to other crew members and to the aircraft&#x27;s radio. Military aviators&#x27; oxygen masks have face pieces that partially cover the sides of the face and protect the face against flash burns, flying particles, and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by ejection seat or parachute. They are often part of a pressure suit or intended for use with a flight helmet.

=== Regulations ===

Three main kinds of oxygen masks are used by pilots and crews who fly at high altitudes: continuous flow, diluter demand, and pressure demand.

In a &quot;continuous-flow system&quot;, oxygen is provided to the user continuously. It does not matter if the user is exhaling or inhaling as oxygen is flowing from the time the system is activated. Below the oxygen mask is a rebreather bag that collects oxygen during exhalation and as a result allows a higher flow rate during the inhalation cycle.

&quot;Diluter-demand&quot; and &quot;pressure-demand&quot; masks supply oxygen only when the user inhales. They each require a good seal between the mask and the user&#x27;s face.

In a &quot;diluter-demand system,&quot; as the altitude increases (ambient pressure, and therefore the partial pressure of ambient oxygen, decreases), the oxygen flow increases such that the partial pressure of oxygen is roughly constant. Diluter-demand oxygen systems can be used up to .

In a &quot;pressure-demand system&quot;, oxygen in the mask is above ambient pressure, permitting breathing above . Because the pressure inside the mask is greater than the pressure around the user&#x27;s torso, inhalation is easy, but exhalation requires more effort. Aviators are trained in pressure-demand breathing in altitude chambers. Because they seal tightly, pressure-demand-type oxygen masks are also used in hyperbaric oxygen chambers and for oxygen breathing research projects with standard oxygen regulators.

Supplemental oxygen is needed for flying more than 30 minutes at cabin pressure altitudes of or higher, pilots must use oxygen at all times above and each occupant must be provided supplemental oxygen above .

==Aviation passenger masks and emergency oxygen systems==

Most commercial aircraft are fitted with oxygen masks for use when cabin pressurization fails. In general, commercial aircraft are pressurized so that the cabin air is at a pressure equivalent to no more than altitude (usually somewhat lower altitude), where one can breathe normally without an oxygen mask. If the oxygen pressure in the cabin drops below a safe level, risking hypoxia, compartments containing the oxygen masks will open automatically, either above or in front of the passenger and crew seats, and in the lavatories.

In the early years of commercial flight, before pressurized cabins were invented, airliner passengers sometimes had to wear oxygen masks during routine flights.

==Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)==
Firefighters and emergency service workers use full face masks that provide breathing air as well as eye and face protection. These masks are typically attached to a tank carried upon the back of the wearer and are called self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA). Open circuit SCBAs do not normally supply oxygen, as it is not necessary and constitutes an easily avoidable fire hazard. Rebreather SCBAs usually supply oxygen as this is the lightest and most compact option, and uses a simpler mechanism than other types of rebreather.

==Specialized masks for astronauts==
Specialized full-face masks that supply oxygen or other breathing gases are used by astronauts to remove nitrogen from their blood before space walks (EVA).

==Specialized masks for pets==
Specialized snout masks which supply oxygen to revive family pets have been donated to fire departments.

==Oxygen delivery to divers==
Divers only use pure oxygen for accelerated decompression, or from oxygen rebreathers at shallow depths where the risk of acute oxygen toxicity is acceptable. Oxygen supply during in-water decompression is via rebreather, open circuit diving regulator, full-face mask or diving helmet which has been prepared for .

===Built-in breathing system===
Oxygen supply to divers in decompression chambers is preferably through a built-in breathing system, which uses an oxygen mask plumbed into supply and exhaust hoses which supply oxygen from outside the chamber, and discharge the exhaled oxygen-rich gas outside the chamber, using a system equivalent to two demand valves, one upstream of the diver, to supply oxygen on demand, and the other downstream, to exhaust exhaled gas on demand, so that the oxygen partial pressure in the chamber is limited to relatively safe levels. If oxygen masks are used that discharge into the chamber, the chamber air must be replaced frequently to keep the oxygen level within safe operating limits.

==Anesthesia oxygen masks==
Anesthesia masks are face masks that are designed to administer anesthetic gases to a patient through inhalation. Anesthesia masks are either made of anti-static silicone or rubber, as a static electricity spark may ignite some anesthetic gases. They are either black rubber or clear silicone. Anesthesia masks fit over the mouth and nose and have a double hose system. One hose carries inhaled anesthetic gas to the mask and the other brings exhaled anesthetic gas back to the machine. Anesthesia masks have 4 point head strap harnesses to securely fit on the head to hold the mask in place as the anaesthetist controls the gases and oxygen inhaled.

==Masks for high-altitude climbers== 
Oxygen masks are used by climbers of high peaks such as Mount Everest. Because of the severe cold and harsh conditions oxygen masks for use at extreme altitude must be robust and effective. The oxygen storage tanks used with the masks (called oxygen bottles) are made of lightweight, high-strength metals and are covered in high-strength fiber such as kevlar. These special oxygen bottles are filled with oxygen at a very high pressure which provides a longer time duration of oxygen for breathing than standard pressure oxygen bottles. These systems are generally only used above .

In recent years oxygen mask systems for high-altitude climbing which pump oxygen constantly have been increasingly replaced by systems supplying oxygen on demand via nasal cannulas.

==Oxygen helmets==
Oxygen helmets are used in hyperbaric oxygen chambers for oxygen administration. They are transparent, lightweight plastic helmets with a seal that goes around the wearer&#x27;s neck that looks like a space suit helmet. They offer a good visual field. Light weight plastic hoses provide oxygen to the helmet and remove exhaled gas to the outside of the chamber. Oxygen helmets are often preferred for oxygen administration in hyperbaric oxygen chambers for children and patients that are uncomfortable wearing an oxygen mask.

==Mask retention systems==
Medical oxygen masks are held in place by medical personnel or the user by hand, or they may be fitted with a lightweight elastic headband so the mask can be removed quickly. Full-face masks are secured by several straps. Tightly fitting oxygen masks are secured at four points by two head straps. Aviators&#x27; masks are often equipped with &quot;quick don&quot; harnesses that allow those in pressurized aircraft to rapidly don the masks in emergencies. Military aviators&#x27; oxygen masks are secured to flight helmets with quick-release systems.

<doc id="1297813" wikidata="Q526050" url="?curid=1297813" title="French denier">
<text>The denier (; , , ;  d.) or penny was a medieval coin which takes its name from the Frankish coin first issued in the late seventh century; in English it is sometimes referred to as a silver penny. Its appearance represents the end of gold coinage, which, at the start of Frankish rule, had either been Roman (Byzantine) or &quot;pseudo-imperial&quot; (minted by the Franks in imitation of Byzantine coinage). Silver would be the basis for Frankish coinage from then on. The &quot;denier&quot; was minted in France, Cyprus and parts of the Italian peninsula for the whole of the Middle Ages, in states such as the patriarchate of Aquileia, the Kingdom of Sicily, the Republic of Genoa, the Republic of Siena, Kingdom of Cyprus, and the crusader state Kingdom of Jerusalem, among others.

==History==
===Coin===
Around AD 755, amid the Carolingian Reforms, Pepin the Short introduced a new currency system which was eventually adjusted so that 12 pence (; ) equaled one &quot;shilling&quot; (&#x27;; &#x27; or &#x27;) and 20 shillings equaled one pound (&#x27;, &#x27;, or &#x27;; &quot;&quot;). Later, three deniers equaled one liard. Only the denier was an actual coin; the rest were money of account. This system and the denier itself served as the model for many of Europe&#x27;s currencies, including sterling, the Italian lira, the Spanish dinero and the Portuguese dinheiro.

===Interest rates===
In Ancien Régime France, the denier was used as a notional measure of interest rates on loans. Thus, a rate of 4% (1/25) would be expressed as &quot;denier 25&quot;; a rate of 5% (1/20) as &quot;denier 20&quot;; and so forth.

<doc id="1297816" wikidata="Q6935433" url="?curid=1297816" title="Mummerset">
<text>Mummerset is a fictional English dialect supposedly spoken in a rustic English county of the same name. Mummerset is used by actors to represent a stereotypical English West Country accent while not specifically referencing any particular county.

The name is a portmanteau of mummer (an archaic term for a folk actor) and Somerset, a largely rural county.

Mummerset draws on a mixture of characteristics of real dialects from the West Country, such as rhoticism, forward-shifted diphthongs, lengthened vowels, and the voicing of word-initial consonants that are voiceless in other English dialects. Word-initial &quot;S&quot; is replaced with &quot;Z&quot;; &quot;F&quot; is replaced with &quot;V&quot;. It also uses perceived dialect grammar, replacing instances of &quot;am&quot;, &quot;are&quot; and &quot;is&quot; with &quot;be&quot;. The sentence &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen him, that farmer, since Friday&quot; could be parsed in Mummerset as &quot;Oi ain&#x27;t zeen &#x27;im that be varmer zince Vroiday&quot;.

Some speakers of East Anglian English have objected to media portrayals of characters from that area speaking in &quot;a strange kind of stage Mummerset&quot;, as in the TV adaptation of P.D. James&#x27; Adam Dalgliesh novel &quot;Devices and Desires&quot;.

==In literature==
A speech from Edgar in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, before his fight with Oswald in Act IV, scene 6, has been described as an example of mummerset:

<doc id="1297840" wikidata="Q7232229" url="?curid=1297840" title="Portrait (The 5th Dimension album)">
<text>Portrait is the fifth album by the American pop group the 5th Dimension, released in 1970. This is the group&#x27;s first album for Bell Records, having switched from the Soul City Records label. The cover features an impressionistic portrait by famous artist LeRoy Neiman.

The album languished in the mid-60s on the Billboard Top LPs chart after the release of its first three singles, none of which entered the top 20 of the American pop music charts. Bell Records, hoping to see a return on the investment they made by signing the 5th Dimension after the group&#x27;s contract at Soul City Records ended, made a fourth and final attempt at a hit – a relatively uncommon practice at the time – with the release of Burt Bacharach and Hal David&#x27;s &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot;. The single rose all the way to No. 2 by Christmas 1970, becoming one of the group&#x27;s greatest hits of all time. As a result, &quot;Portrait&quot; began climbing the charts once again, eventually peaking at No. 20. The single features Marilyn McCoo on lead vocal, and ushers in the 5th Dimension&#x27;s transition from pop to adult contemporary artists. McCoo from this point became the primary vocalist for the group&#x27;s subsequent chart hits, including &quot;Last Night (I Didn&#x27;t Get to Sleep at All)&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Lines, Angles and Rhymes&quot;, &quot;Never My Love&quot;, &quot;If I Could Reach You&quot;, &quot;House for Sale&quot;, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Been Changed&quot; and &quot;Flashback&quot;. This became a source of friction for the group as time went on, and was in part responsible for McCoo and husband Billy Davis Jr. leaving the group after the release of &quot;Earthbound&quot; in 1975.

<text>Geoffrey de Mandeville (died c. 1100), also known as de Magnaville (from the Latin &quot;de Magna Villa&quot; &quot;of the great town&quot;), was a Constable of the Tower of London. Mandeville was a Norman, from one of several places that were known as Magna Villa in the Duchy of Normandy. These included the modern communes of Manneville-la-Goupil and Mannevillette. Some records indicate that Geoffrey de Mandeville was from Thil-Manneville, in Seine-Maritime, Haute-Normandy (upper Normandy).

==Life==

An important Domesday tenant-in-chief, de Mandeville was one of the ten richest magnates of the reign of William the Conqueror. William granted him large estates, primarily in Essex, but in ten other shires as well. He served as the first sheriff of London and Middlesex, and perhaps also in Essex, and in Hertfordshire. He was the progenitor of the de Mandeville Earls of Essex. About 1085 he and Lescelina, his second wife, founded Hurley Priory by the River Thames in Berkshire, as a cell of Westminster Abbey.

==Family==

He married firstly, Athelaise (Adeliza) (d. bef. 1085), by whom he had:

* William de Mandeville (d. bef. 1130), married Margaret dau. of Eudo, dapifer, who m. 2ndly Otuer fitz Count.
* Beatrice de Mandeville, m. Godfrey fitz Eustace, natural son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne. Geoffrey was Lord of Carshalton, Surrey
* Walter, who was also one of his tenants in 1086.

He married secondly Lescelina, by whom he had no children.

<doc id="1297855" wikidata="Q3397848" url="?curid=1297855" title="Dead pool">
<text>A dead pool, also known as a deadpool or death pool, is a game of prediction which involves guessing when someone will die. Sometimes it is a bet where money is involved.

== Modern application ==
In the early 20th century, dead pools were popular in dangerous sports such as motorsport, for example the first edition of the Indianapolis 500.

=== Variants ===
A typical modern dead pool might have players pick out celebrities who they think will die within the year. Most games start on January 1 and run for 12 months, although there are some variations on game length and timing. 

In 2000, website Fucked Company claimed to be a &quot;dot-com dead pool&quot; which invited users to predict the next Internet startups to fail during that era&#x27;s dot com bust. The site itself folded in 2007 after a long history as a target for strategic lawsuits against public participation by companies.

Because of the high body count in the first seven seasons of the popular fantasy television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, dead pools were launched for its final season.

=== Application in contemporary society ===
Britain&#x27;s premier dead pool in recent years has been the Derby Dead Pool, which has run for over 25 years and received an article detailing its players on the BBC website.

The &quot;Rotten.com Dead Pool&quot;, formerly largest in the world, uses NNDB as its source of qualified celebrities, and as arbiter of their life status. 

The concept and success strategies are also detailed in a (previously) annual guide called &quot;The Dead Pool,&quot; written by KQRS-FM radio personality Mike Gelfand and author Mike Wilkinson. KQRS-FM in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota also does an annual on air dead pool contest, where show hosts and listeners will attempt to pick which celebrity will die in that calendar year.

In his AP news article &quot;Some say death pools are in poor taste&quot; (which brought national attention to &quot;The Old Blue Eyes Celebrity Death Watch&quot;), author Matt Sedensky writes, &quot;Players scour newspapers and Web sites for news on celebrities&#x27; health; they rely on tips from insiders; and they consider a public figure&#x27;s lifestyle, absence of recent appearances and rumors of illness.&quot;

==In popular culture==
A dead pool is a key plot element of the 1988 final installment of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film series, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;. Harry investigates the players, when several people listed in a game of dead pool die in suspicious circumstances.

The Marvel Comics character Deadpool (first appearing in 1991) takes his name after escaping from Ajax and Dr. Killebrew, who formed their own dead pool based on which of their experimental subjects would die first. In the 2016 film &quot;Deadpool&quot;, the titular character takes his hero name from a dead pool of mercenaries, himself included, who are regular patrons at his favorite bar.

In the MTV show &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, the main plotline of Season 4 (2014) revolves around a dead pool specifically targeting the supernaturals of Beacon Hills, which is set up by a mysterious character named The Benefactor.

<text>Aryan or Arian () is the first Persian pop band consisting of both male and female singers and players in Iran after the Islamic Revolution. Pahlavan and Salehi are the band&#x27;s lead vocalists, and the songwriters are Pahlavan, Salehi, Amirkhas, Khahani and Farnejad. Their second, third and fourth albums were the bestselling albums of their release years. They are the first Iranian band to feature in the &quot;International Who&#x27;s Who in Music&quot;. They have released four albums, and played concerts around the globe. They donate part of their profits to the &quot;United Nations World Food Programme&quot;. The reason Arian stopped making music was mentioned in an interview with Ali Pahlavan, one of the lead vocalists. First, Ninef Amirkhas, the arranger of all songs and an important member directing the band, left the country. The reason of Ninef Amirkhas leaving is unknown. With Ninef Amirkhas leaving, all of the responsibilities were now left to Pahlavan. &quot;But then came the disputes with our producer and problems with the officials. As the problems grew larger, members gradually lost their enthusiasm due to the lack of suitable conditions to work, and finally called it a day”, Pahlavan said in an interview back in 2015. There is not much known about Ninef Amirkhas. It&#x27;s not even known where currently is. Please contact the editor of this article if you have any information.

==Albums==
Their debut album, &quot;Gole Aftabgardoon&quot; (&quot;The Sunflower&quot;) was released in 2000. 

Their second album, however, had more complex lyrics. It was named &quot;Va Amma, Eshgh&quot; (&quot;And Now, Love&quot;) and released in 2001. It took three years to release the third album, &quot;Till Eternity...&quot;, released in 2004.

In a recent interview with BBC they said, &quot;Now we have a responsibility, we should be better and introduce ourselves all over the world. &quot;If you go to Iranian movies all you see is misery - nothing else. People think Iran is like this - everything is a desert, all the people are crying... We wanted to show the real Iran&quot;.

In 2008, they released their fourth album &quot;Bi to Ba to&quot; and they worked together with Chris de Burgh and produced an English-Persian version of de Burgh&#x27;s song &quot;The Words I Love You&quot; (A light for eternity). In 2009, Arian released a single called &quot;Here Comes Nowrouz, Here Comes Spring&quot; for the Iranian new year.

<text>The Grand College of Rites (officially, the Grand College of Rites of the United States of America) is a Masonic organization.

The Grand College of Rites was established by nine Master Masons in Washington, D.C., on May 12, 1932, for the purpose of controlling and preventing the resurrection of abandoned and unauthorized rituals in the United States. 

The college conducts searches around the world for obscure and defunct rituals of extinct Masonic organizations and prints them in a limited volume titled &quot;Collectanea&quot;, available only to members of the college, so as to establish copyright over them and prevent their resurrection. Its work has been credited with helping stamp out the spread of clandestine and irregular Masonic bodies in the United States.

Among the rituals over which the Grand College claims jurisdiction are those of the Egyptian Masonic Rite of Memphis, Ancient, Free, and Accepted Architects, Ancient and Primitive Rite, and others.

<doc id="1297869" wikidata="Q3516330" url="?curid=1297869" title="Airport improvement fee">
<text>An airport improvement fee or embarkation fee or airport tax or service charge or service fee is an additional fee charged to departing and connecting passengers at an airport. It is levied by government or an airport management corporation and the proceeds are usually intended for funding of major airport improvements or expansion or airport service. Some airports do not levy these fees on connecting passengers who do not leave the airport or whose connecting flight is within a specific timeframe after they arrive.

In the United States, the federal passenger facility charge (PFCs) program allows the collection of PFC fees up to $4.50 for every enplaned passenger at commercial airports controlled by public agencies. Airports use these fees to fund FAA-approved projects that enhance safety, security, or capacity; reduce noise; or increase air carrier competition. Federal law limits use of PFC funds strictly to the above categories.

Depending on the location, the airport improvement fee is included in the cost of traveller&#x27;s airline ticket, in which case the airline will forward the fee to proper agency. However, in some locations the fee must be paid at the point of embarkation. This often creates difficulties for departing passengers who are unfamiliar with this type of procedure, or for departing international passengers who have already exchanged all their local currency. The amount varies usually between US$10 and $30. In some instances, the fee continues to be charged long after construction has been completed (e.g. Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport). A legitimate reason for this is that the airport must finance the cost of the improvement and then pays off these costs over an extended period of time.

Airports currently collecting an explicit airport improvement fee include:
* Ministro Pistarini International Airport (Ezeiza), Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Almost all Brazilian airports administered by Infraero
* Almost all Canadian international airports
* All airports in China
* Ramón Villeda Morales International Airport  San Pedro Sula, Honduras
* Indira Gandhi International Airport New Delhi, India
* All airports in Indonesia
* Ireland West Airport, Knock, Republic of Ireland
* Jorge Chavez International Airport Lima, Peru
* Almost all public airports in the Philippines
* Carrasco International Airport, Montevideo, Uruguay
* Norwich International Airport, Norwich, United Kingdom
* Newquay Cornwall Airport, Newquay, United Kingdom
* All airports in Jamaica

<text>In aviation air safety, a tombstone mentality informally is a pervasive attitude of ignoring design defects until people have died because of them. 

Strictly speaking, tombstone mentality decisions are examples where there is no incentive for an economic actor to be a &#x27;first mover&#x27; and promote safety. Sometimes this is a result of market pressures (nobody wants to pay for extra safety, despite their talk), or, it may be a result of legal disincentives such as product liability lawsuits (if a design change is made that is not government approved and somebody is injured, even if the design change was not the reason for the injury, the company may be liable).

<doc id="1297903" wikidata="Q3437834" url="?curid=1297903" title="Rock music in Estonia">
<text>The Estonian rock music scene saw its beginnings in the mid-1960s during Khrushchev Thaw in the Soviet Union and the rise of British bands all over the world. The first Estonian rock-groups were primarily high school bands playing cover versions of the current UK Top 10. Despite the lack of official support from Soviet authorities (rock music was seen as undesirable Western influence) some of these groups, posing as dance music bands in various clubs, gained a large underground following. Some groups managed to make proper studio recordings and appear a couple of times on television.

The most notable groups of the 1960s were Juuniorid (the first, formed in 1963), Optimistid, Mikronid, Kontrastid and Virmalised.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as both rock and roll and the young Estonian musicians aged, the music became much more complex. Progressive rock, with hard rock influences, began to become more prevalent in Estonia. Musicians from the sixties, who continued their musical career either became established pop-stars or became interested in progressive rock. So called progressive or intellectual rock could be an indulgence, a way to prove the Soviet authorities that rock music could have a deeper meaning. Because of the lack of proper gear some young engineers like Härmo Härm started to make equipment like synthesizers for rock bands. During the seventies Estonian bands began touring in the Soviet Union, some of them becoming quite popular. The first EPs and LPs were released under the Melodiya label.

The most notable groups of the 1970s were Ruja, Gunnar Graps Group, Meie, In Spe and Apelsin.

The early eighties saw the rise of punk rock in Estonia. This rise could be described as a return to the basics. Much like early Estonian rock music was a copy of the UK Top 10 back in the sixties, the new Estonian punk music was highly influenced by UK77 and UK82 raw punk rock. American bands were unreachable. Much like rock music in the 1960s, punk rock was highly disliked by the Soviet authorities. Besides punk rock, the Estonian rock scene in the eighties had its own answer to everything that was going on in the free world - heavy metal, new romantics, and synthpop. However, there was a few years of delay between the Estonian scene and the rest of the world. Despite this, Estonia remained a step ahead of the rest of the Soviet Union and during the perestroika period a few underground bands like J.M.K.E. and Röövel Ööbik became well known in Finland.

The most notable bands of the 1980s were: Generator M, Radar, Rock Hotel, Vitamiin, J.M.K.E., and Singer Vinger.

The nineties saw the fall of music and musicians from previous decades. Youth, looking for something new as usual, got the first taste of electronic. In the early 1990s there were simultaneous small-scale outbreaks of indie rock and metal. A punk survivor from the 1980s - Vennaskond saw mainstream popularity and gained a large following, becoming arguably the most influential Estonian rock band ever. The late 1990s were the low point of the Estonian rock scene. Acts from the first half of the decade continued with minor success, and no new big acts appeared.

The most notable bands of the 1990s were: Vennaskond, Terminaator, The Tuberkuloited, Blind, Smilers and Psychoterror.

The new millennium has seen the slow but continuous rise of rock music. Currently strong metal and indie scenes exist, and Estonia has one of the highest rates of metal bands per capita in the world.

<text>Boricua College is a private college in New York City designed to serve the educational needs of Puerto Ricans and other Latinos in the United States.

==History==
The college was founded by a group of educators and community organizers, including Antonia Pantoja, Victor G. Alicea, Mildred Rodriguez, Francisco G. Ortiz, and Héctor A. Santiago. In 1970, Pantoja created the Puerto Rican Research and Resource Center in Washington, D.C. Through the center, Pantoja co-founded and became the president of the Universidad Boricua, which later evolved into Boricua College. In 1974 Victor G. Alicea was appointed president of the college and has remained in that role ever since.

==Faculty==
The school employs a largely bilingual faculty and staff of 130 full-time and 100 part-time members. According to its Self-Study Report (2014) to the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, in fall 2012-13 it had 59.5 full-time faculty and 25 part-time adjunct faculty. More than 90% are Latine. It serves a student population of 1,200.

==Campuses==
The college has four campuses: in Audubon Terrace, Washington Heights, Manhattan; North Williamsburg, Brooklyn; East Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and the Bronx.

==Accreditation==
Boricua College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In the spring of 2014 the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC/CAEP) evaluated Boricua College&#x27;s Audit Brief and recommended it &quot;above standard&quot; for TEAC&#x27;s three quality principles: Candidate Learning, Faculty Learning, and Capacity and Commitment of the institution. TEAC/CAEP met and accepted the recommendation and accredited, for the maximum allowable of seven years (spring 2014 to spring 2021), the college&#x27;s Bachelor of Science degree program in Childhood Education that included the Generic Studies Liberal Arts and Sciences core curriculum program, and the Masters in Science degree program in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). This national achievement complements the authorization of these programs by the New York State Education Department and the State Certification of the graduates.

==Student body and graduation==
The college&#x27;s courses are taught using Bloom&#x27;s taxonomy model from the 1950s. The model emphasizes the importance of critical thinking skills and clarification of values and increasing students&#x27; capacity for self-reflection. Its student body is 79% adult (over 25 years old with family responsibilities), which characterizes it as a nontraditional college. In his book &quot;Access to Freedom,&quot; James Hall explains that these kinds of colleges cater to adult, working students who may take longer than the six years taken by traditional students to graduate.

According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, Boricua College&#x27;s graduation rate is reportedly 54% among first-time college students who entered in 2006 and graduated in 2012. When students who transfer out to other colleges are taken into account, that positive completion rate is given by the National Center as 69%. Further, during the last 10 years the college&#x27;s education department has program completers who pass the New York State certification examinations at more than the required 80% rate.

===Notable alumni===

*Félix Ortiz, former New York State Assemblyman and Assistant Speaker of the New York State Assembly.
* Robert Torres (stage name Sabor Latino), Hip Hop artist and author

==Notable visitors==
In January 2000 President Bill Clinton visited the Brooklyn campus at its Graham Avenue learning center to inaugurate a Small Business Association at the college.

<text>La Vérendrye is a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1879, and has existed since that time, making it one of the oldest ridings in Manitoba.

Located in the southeastern region of the province, it is bordered within Manitoba by the neighbouring electoral divisions of Lac du Bonnet, Dawson Trail, Steinbach, Springfield-Ritchot, Midland, and Borderland to the west and north; by the province of Ontario to the east; and by the U.S. state of Minnesota to most of the south.

Communities in the riding include Buffalo Point (and Buffalo Point First Nation), Gardenton, Grunthal, Kleefeld, La Broquerie, Marchand, Middlebro, New Bothwell, Otterburne, Piney, St. Malo, St-Pierre-Jolys, Sarto, Sprague, Stuartburn, Sundown, Vassar, Vita, and Woodridge. The Lake of the Woods&#x27; Buffalo Bay is also in the riding.

La Vérendrye was a hotly contested riding between the Liberals and Conservatives in its earliest years. After 1922, it became dominated by the Progressives, who later became the Liberal-Progressives before metamorphosizing into the Liberals again. It remained with the Liberals even as the party dwindled to third-party status in the 1960s. The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba (PCs) seized the riding in 1973 and held it for the next three decades, during which time it was usually fairly safe for the PCs.

In the 1999 election, Ron Lemieux became the first New Democrat to be elected for the constituency. He was re-elected in the 2003 election with almost 60% of the popular vote. The boundary changes of 2008 greatly changed the borders of the riding, which contributed to the decisive victory of PC candidate Dennis Smook in the 2011 election. Lemieux was personally re-elected to the newly created riding of Dawson Trail.

The La Vérendrye riding has remained under PCs since 2011, with Konrad Narth most recently being elected in October 2023 to replace retiring MLA Smook.

The riding is named for Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de La Vérendrye, explorer and fur trader under whose authority Fort Rouge was built in 1738 in what is now Winnipeg.

== Demographics ==
The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,558. In 1999, the average family income was $49,308, and the unemployment rate was 5.9%. Manufacturing accounts for 12% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by the service sector at 11%.

Before the electoral boundaries redistricting done prior to the 2011 election, La Verendrye had the second-highest francophone population in Manitoba (after St. Boniface), at 23% of the total population. Nine percent of the riding&#x27;s residents were German, and 7% were Indigenous.

As of the 2021 census, the riding has a total population of 25,185, 92.5% of whom are Canadian citizens. The median age of constituents is 32.8. The construction industry accounts for 15.2% of the riding&#x27;s labour force, followed by agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting at 14%.

People of German ethnicity now make up the largest ethnic or cultural group of the riding&#x27;s population with 25.3%, followed by Mennonites at 17.6% and French at 14.5%. Seventeen point two percent of the population were identified to have Indigenous identity.

As of 2021, the community includes 2 hospitals, 4 personal care homes, and 17 schools.

<doc id="1297930" wikidata="Q932992" url="?curid=1297930" title="Grosvenor Square">
<text>Grosvenor Square ( ) is a large garden square in the Mayfair district of Westminster, Greater London. It is the centrepiece of the Mayfair property of the Duke of Westminster, and takes its name from the duke&#x27;s surname &quot;Grosvenor&quot;. It was developed for fashionable residences in the 18th century. In the 20th it had an American and Canadian diplomatic presence, and currently is mixed use, commercial.

==History==

Sir Richard Grosvenor obtained a licence to develop Grosvenor Square and the surrounding streets in 1710, and development took place between 1725 and 1731. The land was sold in individual plots, with 30 different builders or partnerships taking a lease; about half of these had become bankrupt by 1738. Grosvenor Square was one of the three or four most fashionable residential addresses in London from its construction until the Second World War, with numerous leading members of the aristocracy in residence.

The early houses were generally of five or seven bays, with basement, three main stories and an attic. Some attempt was made to produce impressive groupings of houses, and Colen Campbell produced a design for a palatial east side to the square featuring thirty Corinthian columns but this was not carried out and in the end most of the houses were built to individual designs. There were mews behind all four sides.

Many of the houses were rebuilt later in the 18th century or during the 19th century, generally acquiring an extra storey when this happened. Number 23 (later 26) was rebuilt in 1773–74 for the 11th Earl of Derby by Robert Adam, and is regarded as one of the architect&#x27;s finest works and as a seminal example of how grandeur of effect and sophisticated planning might be achieved on a confined site. It was demolished and rebuilt again in the 1860s. Nearly all of the older houses were demolished during the 20th century and replaced with blocks of flats in a neo-Georgian style, hotels and embassies.

===The garden===

Providing almost 2.5 hectares of open garden, Grosvenor Square is the second-largest garden square in central London after Russell Square at 2.5 hectares. While Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields at 4.5 hectares is a larger space, it is categorised as an Inn of Court, not a garden square.
Grosvenor Square was originally laid out by gardener John Alston in the 1720s; his &#x27;wilderness worke&#x27; design was a celebration of the countryside in the city. However, the gardens have been modified over time to meet the changing needs of those around them. Reserved for residents&#x27; use for much of its life, the Grade II-registered landscape was, after the Second World War, made a public space for everyone&#x27;s enjoyment, through the (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 83). It was then managed by the Royal Parks until 2018, when Grosvenor Britain &amp; Ireland took over its management.

Following an international Call for Ideas in 2018, Grosvenor confirmed that the square would be redesigned to enhance its contribution to the environment and local communities.  In June 2022, Westminster City Council approved a proposal to transform the square into &quot;an extraordinary garden with groundbreaking environmental credentials&quot;. It is expected that, once started, the works would take around two years to complete.

===Bentley Boys of the 1920s===
In the 1920s, four of the &quot;Bentley Boys&quot; – Woolf Barnato, Tim Birkin, Glen Kidston and Bernard Rubin – took adjacent flats in the fashionable south-east corner of the square, where their day-long parties became something of social legend. So common was the sight of their large, green sports cars parked &quot;ad hoc&quot; outside their flats, that for many years London cab drivers referred to the spot as &quot;Bentley Corner&quot;.

=== American presence ===

Grosvenor Square was long a center of American presence in London beginning when John Adams established the first American mission to the Court of St. James&#x27;s in 1785. Adams lived, from 1785 to 1788, in the house which still stands on the corner of Brook and Duke Streets.

During the Second World War American general Dwight D. Eisenhower established a military headquarters at 20 Grosvenor Square, and during this time the square was nicknamed &quot;Eisenhower Platz&quot;. Until 2009, the United States Navy continued to use this building as its headquarters for United States Naval Forces Europe. A statue of wartime president Franklin D. Roosevelt sculpted by Sir William Reid Dick stands in the square, as does a later statue of Eisenhower, and a statue of president Ronald Reagan. The square also contains the Eagle Squadrons Memorial.

The former United States Embassy of 1938–1960 on the square was purchased by the Canadian government and renamed Macdonald House. It was part of the Canadian High Commission in London until 2014, when all the functions of the Canadian High Commission were transferred to Canada House in Trafalgar Square.
In 1960, a new United States Embassy was built on the western side of Grosvenor Square. This was a large and architecturally significant modern design by Eero Saarinen, being at the time a controversial insertion into a mainly Georgian and neo-Georgian district of London. In March and October 1968, there were large demonstrations in the square against US involvement in the Vietnam War. On both occasions, the protest became violent. After 2001 a series of anti-terrorist devices were installed around the embassy, and the road running along the front of the building was closed completely to traffic. In 2006, the Grosvenor Square Safety Group residents association took out advertisements in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, accusing the Metropolitan Police and local government of a &quot;moral failure&quot; for not closing two other roads adjacent to the embassy.

In 2008, the United States Government chose a site for a new embassy in the Nine Elms area of the London Borough of Wandsworth, south of the River Thames. Construction of the new Embassy of the United States in London began in 2013, with relocation completed by 2017. In October 2009, following a recommendation by English Heritage, the Saarinen designed building was granted Grade II listed status. The listing means that the new owners will not be allowed to change the facade, which includes the 35-foot-wingspread gilded-aluminium eagle that hovers above the main entrance. In November 2009, the Grosvenor Square property was purchased by the Qatari Diar investment group.

=== Adlai Stevenson ===
On 14 July 1965, while walking with Marietta Tree, the then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson, suffered a heart attack, later dying at the old St George&#x27;s Hospital at Hyde Park Corner. As they reached the front of the Sportsman&#x27;s Club, his last words were reportedly to ask her to slow down.

===Oscar Wilde===
The writer Oscar Wilde lived in Grosvenor Square between 1883 and 1884, and references to the square appear in four of his works (see section below).

===Memorial to victims of 11 September 2001===
Since 2003, the east of the gardens has contained a memorial garden to 67 British victims of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. The poem &quot;For Katrina&#x27;s Sun-Dial&quot; by Henry van Dyke was chosen for inscription on an elliptical granite block engraved with the names of the victims, underneath which is buried a piece of the steel wreckage.

=== Diplomatic property sell-off ===
The former United States Navy building at 20 Grosvenor Square was sold in 2007 for £250 million to Richard Caring, who planned to turn it into 41 residential apartments. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council and property developer Finchatton then bought the building for the same amount in April 2013, with planning permission to convert the building into 31 luxury apartments.

In September 2013, the Government of Canada announced its intention to sell its High Commission building at 1 Grosvenor Square and &quot;consolidate its diplomatic activity in the UK in a single, central location in Canada House on Trafalgar Square&quot;.

<text>Paul Phillips (born August 9, 1972, in San Francisco, California) is an American software developer, entrepreneur and poker player.

==Programming==
Phillips wrote the Boa web server while attending the University of California, San Diego, but no longer maintains it. In 1994, one of his colleagues at college discovered he had an interest in blackjack and subsequently introduced him to poker.

In 1996, he became Chief Technical Officer for Go2Net. This success is the basis of his nickname Dot-com.

Phillips subsequently started working on the Scala compiler and standard library. He is co-founder of Akka.io (then known as Typesafe, later known as Lightbend), a company specializing in the production and support of an open-source platform for software development based on Scala and Akka. He left Lightbend in 2013 over differences in the architecture of the language, collections library and compiler.

==Poker==
Phillips is known as a controversial figure in the poker world. He was banned from competing in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in the early 2000s due to comments he made about the way in which the Horseshoe split entry money between players and casino employees. Despite being reinstated as a competitor in late 2001, he only played one event in 2002 (placing 2nd to John Juanda in the $1,500 triple draw lowball Ace to Five event).

Despite choosing not to play in the WSOP, Phillips finished 2nd in the 2003 Tournament Poker Money List.

In 2004, he made three WSOP final tables (one in Omaha hi-lo split and two in no limit hold&#x27;em.)

He spoke out against the inclusion of Phil Hellmuth Jr, Doyle &quot;Texas Dolly&quot; Brunson and Johnny &quot;Oriental Express&quot; Chan in the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, and subsequently became the subject of message board flame wars.

Phillips has played in both of the first two National Heads-Up Poker Championships, losing in second round play both years.

As of 2012, his total live tournament winnings exceed $2,300,000. However, Phillips has no tournament cashes since 2005.

In an April 27, 2009 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on neuroenhancement, Phillips was quoted at length discussing his use of prescription drugs such as Adderall and Provigil to improve his focus and concentration during tournament play.

==Personal life==
Phillips is married with two daughters, and has not played as many poker tournaments since 2005 to spend more time with his family.

Phillips is also active among internet bulletin boards and played tournament Scrabble regularly until 2007.

Phillips was popular on the platform LiveJournal in the early 2000s, where he opined on programming, poker, and lifestyle controversies.

<doc id="1297934" wikidata="Q3796728" url="?curid=1297934" title="Immunization (finance)">
<text>In finance, interest rate immunization is a portfolio management strategy designed to take advantage of the offsetting effects of interest rate risk and reinvestment risk. 

In theory, immunization can be used to ensure that the value of a portfolio of assets (typically bonds or other fixed income securities) will increase or decrease by the same amount as a designated set of liabilities, thus leaving the equity component of capital unchanged, regardless of changes in the interest rate. It has found applications in financial management of pension funds, insurance companies, banks and savings and loan associations. 

Immunization can be accomplished by several methods, including cash flow matching, duration matching, and volatility and convexity matching. It can also be accomplished by trading in bond forwards, futures, or options.

Other types of financial risks, such as foreign exchange risk or stock market risk, can be immunised using similar strategies. If the immunization is incomplete, these strategies are usually called hedging. If the immunization is complete, these strategies are usually called arbitrage.

== History ==
Immunisation was discovered independently by several researchers in the early 1940s and 1950s. This work was largely ignored before being re-introduced in the early 1970s, whereafter it gained popularity. See Dedicated Portfolio Theory#History for details.

===Redington===
Frank Redington is generally considered to be the originator of the immunization strategy. Redington was an actuary from the United Kingdom. In 1952 he published his &quot;Review of the Principle of Life-Office Valuations,&quot; in which he defined immunization as &quot;the investment of the assets in such a way that the existing business is immune to a general change in the rate of interest.&quot; Redington believed that if a company (for example, a life insurance company) structured its investment portfolio assets to be of the same duration as its liabilities, and market interest rates decreased during the planning horizon, the lower yield earned on reinvested cash flows would be offset by the increased value of portfolio assets remaining at the end of the planning period. On the other hand, if market interest rates increased, the same offset effect would occur: higher yields earned on reinvested cash flows would be offset by a reduction in the value of the portfolio. In either scenario, with offsetting effects on each side of the balance sheet, the shareholders&#x27; equity value of the business would be immunized from the effect of changes in interest rates.

===Fisher and Weil===
In 1971, Lawrence Fisher and Roman Weil framed the issue as follows: to immunize a portfolio, &quot;the average duration of the bond portfolio must be set equal to the remaining time in the planning horizon, and the market value of assets must be greater than or equal to the present value of the liabilities discounted at the internal rate of return of the portfolio.&quot;

== Applications ==
Pension funds use immunization to lock in current market rates, when they are attractive, over a specified planning horizon, and to fund a future stream of pension benefit payments to retirees. Banks and thrift (savings and loan) associations immunize in order to manage the relationship between assets and liabilities, which affects their capital requirements. Insurance companies construct immunized portfolios to support guaranteed investment contracts, structured financial instruments which are sold to institutional investors.

==How portfolios are immunized==
Immunization theory assumes that the yield curve is flat, and that interest rate changes are parallel shifts up or down in that yield curve.

===Cash flow matching===
Conceptually, the easiest form of immunization is cash flow matching. For example, if a financial company is obliged to pay 100 dollars to someone in 10 years, it can protect itself by buying and holding a 10-year, zero-coupon bond that matures in 10 years and has a redemption value of $100. Thus, the firm&#x27;s expected cash inflows would exactly match its expected cash outflows, and a change in interest rates would not affect the firm&#x27;s ability to pay its obligations. Nevertheless, a firm with many expected cash flows can find that cash flow matching can be difficult or expensive to achieve in practice. Once, that meant that only institutional investors could afford it. But the advent of the Internet and the personal computer relieved much of this difficulty. Dedicated portfolio theory is based on cash flow matching and is being used by personal financial advisors to construct retirement portfolios for private individuals. Withdrawals from the portfolio to pay living expenses represent the stream of expected future cash flows to be matched. Individual bonds with staggered maturities are purchased whose coupon interest payments and redemptions supply the cash flows to meet the withdrawals of the retirees.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows. Let the net cash flow at time formula_1 be denoted by formula_2, i.e.:

: formula_3

where formula_4 and formula_5 represent cash inflows and outflows or liabilities respectively.

Assuming that the present value of cash inflows from the assets is equal to the present value of the cash outflows from the liabilities, then:

: formula_6  

===Duration matching===

Another immunization method is duration matching. Here, a portfolio manager creates a bond portfolio with a duration equal to the duration of the liabilities. To make the match actually profitable under changing interest rates, the assets and liabilities are arranged so that the total convexity of the assets exceed the convexity of the liabilities. In other words, one can match the first derivatives (with respect to interest rate) of the price functions of the assets and liabilities and make sure that the second derivative of the asset price function is set to be greater than or equal to the second derivative of the liability price function.

===Rebalancing===
Immunization requires that the average durations of assets and liabilities be kept equal at all times. This makes it necessary to rebalance the portfolio investments regularly, because the years remaining in the planning period grow shorter with each passing year. Coupon income, reinvestment income, proceeds from maturities and sales proceeds must be reinvested in securities that will keep the portfolio&#x27;s duration equal to the remaining years in the planning period.

===Immunization in practice===
An immunization strategy is designed so that as interest rates change, interest-rate risk and reinvestment risk will offset each other. However, as Dr. Frank Fabozzi points out, the Macaulay duration metric and immunization theory are based on the assumption that any shifts in the yield curve during the planning period will be parallel, i.e. equal at each point in the term structure of interest rates. But when a non-parallel shift in the yield curve occurs, there is a risk that the portfolio will not be immunized even if its duration matches the liability duration. Immunization risk can be quantified so that a portfolio that minimizes this risk can be constructed. 

A principal component analysis of changes along the U.S. Government Treasury yield curve reveals that more than 90% of yield curve shifts are parallel shifts, followed by a smaller percentage of slope shifts and a small percentage of curvature shifts. Using that knowledge, an immunized portfolio can be created by creating long positions with durations at the long and short end of the curve, and a matching short position with a duration in the middle of the curve. These positions protect against parallel shifts and slope changes, in exchange for exposure to curvature changes. 

Immunization can be done in a portfolio of a single asset type, such as government bonds, by creating long and short positions along the yield curve. It is usually possible to immunize a portfolio against the most prevalent risk factors.

<text>Maharao Shekhaji (1433–1488) was a Rajput ruler in 15th-century India. He is the namesake of the Shekhawati region, comprising the districts of Sikar, Churu and Jhunjhunu in the modern Indian state of Rajasthan. His descendants are known as the Shekhawat.

==Birth==
On Rao Mokal&#x27;s Death in AD 1445, the twelve year old Maharao Shekhaji Succeeded his father&#x27;s estates at Amarsar. His parents are said to have sought prayers from a pir Sheikh, after whom Shekhaji was named.

Shekhaji succeeded as the head of the Nayan and Barwada estate, along with 24 more villages, at the age of 12, as a result of the untimely death of his father Mokal Ji in 1445.

==Life==
When Shekhaji inherited his father&#x27;s estate, his reputation and power attracted the jealousy of the Lord Paramount of Amber. He was attacked, but by the aid of the Punnee Pathans he successfully withstood the reiterated assaults of his suzerain lord. Up to this period they had acknowledged the Amber princes as liege lords, and in token of the alliance paid as tribute all the colts reared on the original estate. A dispute on this point was the ostensible cause (though subordinate to their rapid prosperity) of intermittent separations of the Shekhawat colonies from the parent state, which lasted until the reign of Sawai Jai Singh, who brought submission and pecuniary relief from them. Shekhaji left a well-established position to his youngest son Raimal.. After Rao Raimal, Rao Lunkaran (1548-1584) was made the Head of Amarsar. After is Death, the Ancestral seat of Amarsar was succeeded by his Son Rao Manohar. Later Shahpura, became the capital of Old Amarsar - Manoharpur line of Shekhawats.

==Death==

Shekhaji died in 1488 fighting the Gaur Rajputs in the war of Ghatwa defending the modesty and self-respect of a newlywed lady. Shekhaji took his last breath at Ralawta. A cenotaph (&quot;Chhatri&quot;) was built where he died. A statue of Shekhaji was also inaugurated in the same place by the President of India Smt. Pratibha Patil.

<doc id="1297946" wikidata="Q3504286" url="?curid=1297946" title="Super Robot Wars">
<text>Super Robot Wars, known in Japan as is a series of Japanese tactical role-playing video games produced by Bandai Namco Entertainment, formerly Banpresto. Starting out as a spinoff of the &quot;Compati Hero&quot; series, the main feature of the franchise is having a story that crosses over several popular mecha anime, manga and video games, allowing characters and mecha from different titles to team up or battle one another. The first game in the franchise was released for the Game Boy on April 20, 1991. Later spawning numerous games that were released on various consoles and handhelds. Due to the nature of crossover games and licensing involved, only a few games have been released outside Japan, and in English; &quot;Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation&quot; and its sequel were the first of these in 2006. The franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016, and its 30th anniversary in 2021, and &quot;Super Robot Wars 30&quot; was also released overseas.

==Games==
Most are standalone games, whose background stories may involve the plots of the included series, but no other &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; titles. However, there are several main continuities existing with a large Multiverse:

;Classic
:Consists of the &quot;2nd&quot;, the &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;EX&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F Final&quot; games (in that order). &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F Final&quot; replaced the &quot;4th&quot;, while &quot;2G&quot; is not considered canon, due to its non-inclusion in the &quot;Complete Box&quot; set. The side-story &quot;Masō Kishin - The Lord Of Elemental&quot; is divided into two parts: &quot;Part One&quot; occurs before the 2nd and &quot;Part Two&quot; after the &quot;4th&quot; (&quot;4th&quot; was released before &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F Final&quot;). The primary antagonist organization of this series is known as DC (Divine Crusaders).
;Masou Kishin
:Consists of &quot;Gaiden: Masou Kishin - The Lord of Elemental&quot;, &quot;OG Saga: Masou Kishin 2 - Revelation of Evil God&quot;, &quot;OG Saga: Masou Kishin 3 - Pride of Justice&quot; and &quot;OG Saga: Masou Kishin F – Coffin of the End&quot; (in that order). &quot;Gaiden: Masou Kishin - The Lord of Elemental&quot; for the SFC was ported as a remake for the NDS (with a series first use of the &quot;OG Saga&quot; prefix replacing &quot;Gaiden&quot;) and later as a remake of that DS version in a limited edition bundle with part 2 of this series, named &quot;OG Saga: Masou Kishin I &amp; II&quot;, for the PSP. The last two titles in this series were released for the PS3 (the former also was ported to the PS Vita).
;Alpha
:Consists of &quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Alpha Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Alpha 2&quot; and &quot;Alpha 3&quot; games (in that order). &quot;Part One&quot; of &quot;Masō Kishin - The Lord Of Elemental&quot; also provides relevant information, taking place before Alpha.
;Compact
:Consists of &quot;Compact&quot;, &quot;Compact 2&quot; and &quot;Compact 3&quot; games for the Wonderswan (in that order). The first series game on WS &quot;Compact&quot; was remade as &quot;Compact for WonderSwan Color&quot; for the Wonderswan Color. &quot;Compact 2&quot; was released as three chapters for the &quot;WonderSwan&quot;; the trilogy was later compiled with updated visuals, sound and new content as &quot;Impact&quot; for the PS2.
;Impact
:Consists of &quot;Impact&quot; and &quot;MX&quot; games for the PS2. Previously, &quot;Compact 2&quot; was released as three chapters for the &quot;WonderSwan&quot;; the trilogy was later compiled with updated visuals, sound and new content as &quot;Impact&quot; for the PS2. Despite the sharing of gameplay mechanics between all of the Wonderswan games, and the similarities between &quot;Impact&quot; and &quot;MX&quot;, &quot;Compact 2&quot; and &quot;Impact&quot; are not tied to any other games in the series. &quot;MX&quot; for the PS2 is seen as a direct sequel to &quot;Impact&quot; as it reuses several of the same series of the latter and has similar gameplay elements and much of its soundtrack remixed from the one in &quot;Impact&quot;. &quot;MX&quot; was ported to the PSP with minor adjustments and additions.
;Original Generation
:This series does not feature any manga or anime characters at all, instead starring the &quot;Banpresto Originals&quot;, original characters made specifically for previous games in the series. This timeline draws upon from all previous continuities. Both Original Generation games for the GBA which were released in the US were compiled with updated visuals and sound as &quot;Super Robot Wars Original Generations&quot;, followed by the sequel &quot;Super Robot Wars Original Generation Gaiden&quot;, the remake version of &quot;Masō Kishin - The Lord Of Elemental&quot;, &quot;Masō Kishin 2: Revelation of Evil God&quot;, &quot;2nd Super Robot Wars Original Generation&quot;, &quot;Masō Kishin 3: Pride of Justice&quot;, &quot;Masō Kishin F: Coffin of The End&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Moon Dwellers&quot;. Also part of the Original Generation series is the &quot;Endless Frontier series&quot;, composing of &quot;Endless Frontier&quot; and &quot;Endless Frontier Exceed&quot;, which is set after &quot;Original Generation Gaiden&quot;. This continuity was the only one to have had titles officially released in the West. &quot;The Moon Dwellers&quot; is one of the first in the series that has an English translation for the Japanese market.
;Z
:This continuity consists of &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;Z Special Disk&quot;, &quot;Z2&quot;, and &quot;Z3&quot; in that order. The story focuses on the Twelve Spheres, which play an important part in the game&#x27;s story line. This timeline is well-known for introducing an extremely large amount of debuting series, on a scale that previous &quot;SRW&quot; titles have never reached. In addition, &quot;Z3&quot; was the first &quot;SRW&quot; game to have HD sprites.
;International Era
:Consists of &quot;V, X, T&quot; and &quot;30&quot;. This continuity is commonly named this due to &quot;SRW V&quot; being the first mainline game to receive official translation and release outside of Japan. Using the engine utilized in &quot;Z3&quot;, these games are independent of each other plot-wise.
;Mobile games
:Consists of &quot;X-Omega&quot; and &quot;DD&quot;.&quot; X-Omega&quot; is a departure from &quot;SRW&quot;&#x27;s usual turn-based strategy formula, and is more similar to a defense-type game, where units are placed and commanded to defend against invading enemies. It is known to have an extremely large number of debuting series, and also have non-mecha anime crossovers. 
:&quot;DD&quot; returns to the usual &quot;SRW&quot; turn-based strategy formula, and battles are much more reminiscent of normal &quot;SRW&quot; games. However, players are only allowed to deploy 4 of their own units at a time, and instead of mechs being pulled from the gacha, attacks are instead.

==Recurring elements==
===Story===
In most games, the player selects or is given a Banpresto original character and machine, who is connected to the overarching storyline which ties together the events of the constituent anime for the game. Some featured anime also has their plots intertwined: in &quot;Super Robot Wars Alpha&quot;, the White Fang from &quot;New Mobile Report Gundam Wing&quot; allies with Paptimus Scirocco&#x27;s rebellion from &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, resulting in the two enemy forces working together. The stories play out the events of the anime, albeit altered to make room for characters, settings, and plot elements from other shows. It is said that the events of each game are caused by incursions known as Dimension Quakes that started several years prior with the explosion of a &quot;dimensional bomb&quot;, thereby constantly merging and separating the various universes without anyone knowing, and ensuring canonicity with both the other games and the properties they adapt.

One of the most notable recurring changes in the series is the near-complete absence of character death. Whenever the game gets to a point that a character died within their anime, the games will frequently use an element from another series to ensure the character&#x27;s survival. This is likely done in order for the games to appeal to a broader audience.

===Gameplay===
Battles in &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; are turn-based. The player usually gets to move their forces first, one at a time, then control switches to the game&#x27;s AI. When a unit attacks, the target reacts by blocking (increasing defense against the attack), evading (reducing the attack&#x27;s chance to hit), or countering (striking back with their own attack). Once chosen, the battle animation is played out. If the player unit is not destroyed and successfully damaged the enemy, then the unit gains experience points. All battles are carried out either the terrain of land, air, sea or space, which affects the performance of machines, pilots and weapons in various ways. The battlefield also contains objects which grant various effects. For example, besides providing repair and energy refill, a military base also provides land units with defense bonus but will hinder them from moving freely. In addition to standard mecha and vehicle units, the player often has one or more &quot;Battleships&quot;, air- or spacecraft units that in addition to powerful long-ranged attacks, can also dock other units to refill energy, repair damage.

Units in-game are generally separated into two categories: &quot;super-type&quot; and &quot;real-type&quot;. Super robots are heavy units with exceptionally high hit points and armor, and powerful, close-range weapons with high energy cost. On the other hand, real robots are light units which are faster and more agile, but have less armor and hit points, relying instead on dodging attacks. Their weapons have longer range and better accuracy at the cost of doing less damage per hit. Some units are treated as &quot;support units&quot;, regenerating hit points and/or energy to allies, while battleships and carriers serve as transports or to resupply all units, while also providing powerful fire support. Though every unit takes a single grid on the tactical map and has little visual difference in battle animations, a larger unit gains defensive and offensive bonus against smaller units, but carry a disadvantage to evasion and accuracy. In later titles, certain attacks can bypass the size attribute, nullifying the effect of size in combat. Some units have other unique characteristics: for example, Getter Robo can transform into different forms with new weapons and different attributes.

Weapons carry various attributes other than range, accuracy modifier and attack power. All weapons can be divided into melee and shooting categories that determine its effectiveness by pilots&#x27; status. Other attributes can be affected by terrain or a target&#x27;s defensive ability. In addition, some units make use of &quot;MAP Weapons&quot; which affect multiple squares at once, with some damaging everything in the area and others, such as Cybuster&#x27;s Cyflash, ignoring allies. Some games feature weapons which inflict status effects on enemies that drain their energy, weaken their armor or damage the pilot&#x27;s stats.

==History==
===Origins and development===
In 1990, Japanese video game developer Banpresto released &quot;SD Battle Ōzumō: Heisei Hero Basho&quot;, the debut entry in its &quot;Compati Hero&quot; series, for the Family Computer (Famicom). A crossover between &quot;super deformed&quot; versions of &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, it was created as a congratulatory gift for Yukimasa Sugiura, who at the time had been promoted president of Banpresto. &quot;SD Battle Ōzumō&quot; enjoyed a commercial success in Japan, prompting Banpresto to create a more mature-oriented successor, &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;, for the Game Boy in 1991. The original game borrowed several concepts from &quot;SD Battle Ōzumō&quot;, most notably its usage of characters from other Japanese entertainment properties. Its creation was also in part due to the popularity of both the Game Boy and Famicom in Japan, which continued to dominate the Japanese video game market. Banpresto turned the concept of &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; into a franchise following its commercial success, beginning with &quot;2nd Super Robot Wars&quot; several months later for the Famicom.

Banpresto outsourced development of earlier &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; games to Japanese studio Winkysoft. Beginning with &quot;Super Robot Wars Complete Box&quot; in 1999, the company moved production in-house, with Banpresto&#x27;s consumer game division Banpresoft handling development of future installments. Sugiura intended for &quot;4th Super Robot Wars&quot; to be the final entry, however the franchise&#x27;s lasting popularity prompted the creation of further sequels to meet demand. The company placed Takanobu Terada in the role of series producer; he at first showed little interest in its super-deformed character designs and gameplay structure. As &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; sequels added more original character designs and its scope expanded, Terada showed more appreciation and embraced his role. Sugiura hoped the series could help introduce its players to the anime and manga series featured in each installment, commenting that he hoped it would &quot;sell more and more for 20 years&quot;.

In 2005, Banpresto&#x27;s parent company Bandai merged with Namco, creating Namco Bandai Holdings and subsequently Namco Bandai Games. Banpresto became a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Holdings in 2006, where it continued to develop &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; games in addition to other projects. On April 1, 2008, Banpresto&#x27;s video game operations were absorbed by Namco Bandai Games, with Banpresto being reorganized into a toy and prize machine developer. Terada and other Banpresto employees were transferred to Namco Bandai Games, as the company assuming control of the property. In 2011, Banpresoft and BEC (Bandai Entertainment Company) merged to form B.B. Studio, a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Games that would handle further production of the series.

===Localization===
Many mecha titles included are released only in Japan and the number of titles involved within a single game make for complicated rights and licensing issues releasing it elsewhere. Before &quot;Super Robot Wars 30&quot;, only &quot;Original Generation&quot; games were officially released for the English market by Atlus USA. The titles of the games are given as &quot;Super Robot Taisen&quot;. The games do not have the licensing problems other games may have since only original creations not from any anime or manga series are used in the lineup, thus making it the first game in the series to be released outside of the Asian market. Atlus also released &quot;Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier&quot; for the &quot;Nintendo DS&quot; on April 28, 2009.

In early 2016, Bandai Namco have announced that &quot;Super Robot Wars OG: Moon Dwellers&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Wars V&quot; will be given an English release for the Southeastern Asian version along with a Chinese translation. In December 2017, Bandai Namco announced that Super Robot Wars X would be released in English for Southeast Asia market in 2018. In November 2018, Bandai Namco announced that &quot;Super Robot Wars T&quot; will be released in English for Southeast Asian market in 2019. &quot;Super Robot Wars 30&quot; has had a global release on the Steam platform in all regions, marking the first time in about 13 years that a &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; game was released in such a manner.

==Reception and sales==
As of April 2014, the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series has exceeded 16 million copies across all platforms. The debut entry sold a combined 190,000 units and became a best-seller for the Game Boy during its first few weeks on the market. The best-selling entry is &quot;Super Robot Wars α&quot; on the PlayStation, having sold over 715,000 copies. &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; games have become consistent best-sellers for both Banpresto and Bandai Namco, having regularly appeared on top sales charts in Japan as late as 2019. As of 2022, the series has shipped over 20 million copies worldwide.

Ollie Bardner, a writer for &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, described &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; as &quot;one of Japan&#x27;s most enduring mecha series&quot;, showing appreciation towards its turn-based gameplay and large roster of mecha series and characters. Bardner believes part of the franchise&#x27;s success is introducing its players to older mecha anime series: &quot;Originally intended as a mere mecha anime crossover vehicle,&quot; Super Robot Wars&quot; has become something else. Not only has it facilitated new generations of gamers to discover brilliant anime from times long past, but also birthed unique games and anime in their own right.&quot; &quot;USgamer&quot;″s Kat Bailey stated that the series serves as an &quot;extremely faithful tribute&quot; to the mecha genre and its history, writing that it &quot;beautifully [remixes] everything from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; to &quot;Voltron&quot;.&quot;

The games&#x27; main influence is the creation of animated shows influenced by original units and characters created for the games. The best examples are &quot;Getter Robo Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo&quot; and the &quot;Mazinkaiser&quot; OVA, released in the United States in 2002. Shin Getter Robo first appeared in &quot;Ken Ishikawa&#x27;s&quot; manga for &quot;Getter Robo Go&quot;, then became by its apparition in various Super Robot Wars games until receiving its aforementioned OVAs. Mazinkaiser appeared for the first time in &quot;Super Robot Wars F Final&quot;, released for the &quot;Sega Saturn&quot; and the Sony PlayStation in 1998, as an upgrade to the original Mazinger Z in order to allow the Mazinger franchise to compete with other super robots such as Shin Getter Robo. Mazinger Z writer and illustrator, Go Nagai, eventually implements it into his manga as the prototype of the other Mazinger machines, and the aforementioned OVA was also created.

The series was certified by the Guinness World Records for the &quot;most intellectual property licenses used in a role-playing video game series&quot;.

<text>Common Rider was an American ska punk band, formed in 1999 by Jesse Michaels (guitar, vocals), Mass Giorgini (bass) and Dan Lumley (drums). The band&#x27;s name is taken from a Japanese TV show, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; (Kamen Rider means &quot;Masked Rider&quot; in Japanese.)

== History ==
Michaels was formerly the lead vocalist for Operation Ivy, 1987 to 1989.

The band released two full-length albums and one EP. &quot;Last Wave Rockers&quot; was released in 1999 on Lookout! Records. &quot;Thief In a Sleeping Town&quot; EP was also released on Lookout! Records in 2001 and featured Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day (guitar/backing vocals). The band released &quot;This Is Unity Music&quot; on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band toured the US extensively the same year, including the 2002 Plea For Peace tour, sponsored by Asian Man Records. On the tour, Phillip Hill (from Teen Idols and also a major contributor on the album &quot;This is Unity Music&quot;) played guitar, along with Joe Mizzi. The band&#x27;s last release was a split with Against All Authority in April 2005, containing outtakes from 2002&#x27;s &quot;This Is Unity Music&quot;.

The band broke up in 2003. In 2005, bassist and producer Mass Giorgini went to Australia to record an album for Brisbane-based reggae/ska outfit Scarred Hope; he has also performed with Dan Lumley in the band Squirtgun. Michaels has continued to perform sporadically and to produce art. In late 2008, Michaels emerged with a new band named Classics of Love, after the Common Rider song.

<text>Israeli rock (, &quot;Rok Yisra&#x27;eli&quot;) is rock music created by Israeli bands and singers.

==History==

===1960s===

Israel&#x27;s initial attitude towards rock music was mixed, with the genre gaining popularity amongst the youth but receiving condemnation from the press and government, most notably in 1965 when the minister of education Hanoch Rinot prevented the funding for a possible concert in Ramat Gan by The Beatles, labeling their music as holding &quot;no artistic value&quot;. Israeli musicians of the time believed that it was a fad that would soon pass. The first Israeli rock bands began performing in the mid-1960s in nightclubs and discos, first in Ramla and later on HaMasger Street in Tel Aviv. These bands mainly performed cover versions of popular rock songs by bands like The Beatles and The Shadows. Rock culture, in the social and political sense, was nowhere in sight. Bands that stood out in the first wave of Israeli rock were Yarkon Bridge Trio, The Churchills, The High Windows, The Lions (aka The Lions of Juda), The Styles (aka Uzi and the Styles), The Fat and the Thins, The Blue Stars, The Goldstars, The New Stars, The Generals, The Monks, The Spiders, The Electric Stage, The Seventh Radiance, and The Sing-Sing.

In the euphoria that followed the Six-Day War, the performing groups of the Israel Defense Forces rose in status with a steady stream of songs about victory, bereavement and loss. Rock became part of the alternative music scene that was played mostly in clubs such as &quot;Hakarish&quot; and &quot;Calypso&quot;, formerly known as drug dens.

Near the end of the decade rock and roll gained legitimacy. Western musicians arrived in Israel, and influences of the pop revolution permeated local culture. Some of the local bands added English musicians to their ensemble, creating several new bands that were based on the original rhythm bands. In the second wave of rhythm bands, three main bands led the local rock scene. The first was The Churchills, which consisted of five musicians including Canadian singer Stan Solomon, and British guitarist Robb Huxley. These were the most creative of the Israeli rock bands; they played innovative combinations of psychedelic rock mixed with Mediterranean Arab music. In 1970 the Israeli composer Noam Sheriff initiated a concert played by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and The Churchills, and their shared work with Arik Einstein, Oshik Levi and other artists from the mainstream Israeli pop music scene granted the Israeli rock scene a public stamp of approval. The second band, The Lions, was considered to be the first Israeli band to experiment with reggae music.

The third prominent Israeli band of those years was the supergroup Uzi and the Styles, created by the former lead singer of The Fat and the Thins, Uzi Fox. The band&#x27;s varied style was derived from British pop and American soul music and was characterized by the compound-rich processings of wind instruments that resembled Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Chicago, etc.

By 1969, Arik Einstein had taken The Churchills under his wing as a backup band, and with their help he would record the groundbreaking album &quot;&quot;Poozy&quot;, which is often considered the mainstream breakthrough of the genre. The followup to the album would be the first of several fruitful collaborations with Shalom Hanoch with &quot;Snail&quot; and &quot;Plastilna&quot;&quot; both in 1970.

In the early 1970s, Israel had a burgeoning progressive rock scene. One of the first performers was Shlomo Gronich, whose 1971 debut was &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t You Tell Me?&quot;. Danny Ben Israel&#x27;s &quot;Bullshit 3&quot; was released in 1970, but overlooked for some thirty years. Other 70s prog bands included The Churchills, Zingale, and Sheshet.

Many bands formed in this decade. The rock band Tamouz gained much success in the 1970s. The most successful Israeli Rock band of the seventies was Kaveret which combined rock music and a unique sense of humor. The (consecutive 1st prize) winners of the 1976, 1977, and 1978 Chassidic Song Festival was the band that invented Jewish Rock, The Diaspora Yeshiva Band, who made several albums, had many hits (Hafachta, Malchutcha, Ivdu), and toured worldwide including Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.
At the end of the decade, singers who wrote and performed rock oriented music became very popular and very successful, including Shalom Hanoch (who previously collaborated with Arik Einstein), Ariel Zilber (formerly of Tamuz), Svika Pick (in combination with pop music and disco music), Efraim Shamir, Yitzhak Klepter (formerly of Kaveret and the Churchills) and Gary Eckstein.

===1980s===

During the 1980s a few rock bands became popular. Notable rock bands of the decade were The Click, Benzin, T-Slam, and Mashina which became the most successful Israeli rock band of the decade.

===1990s===

In the 1990s, a new wave of young rock bands and singers started. The entrance of some artists and bands that were formed in the 80s, like the famous duo of Rami Fortis and Berry Sakharof, Mashina, Korin Allal, Meir Banai and others into the Israeli mainstream, inspired many young rock artists such as Aviv Geffen, Inbal Perlmuter, Yermi Kaplan, Assaf Amdursky, and others, and just in the years of 1990-1994 an uncountable number of young rock bands were formed. Bands such as Eifo HaYeled, Monica Sex, HaYehudim, The Elders of Zfat, Rockfour, The Friends of Natasha, Dr. Kasper&#x27;s Rabbits Show, HaMehashefot (The Witches), Tractor’s Revenge, Nosei Hamigbaat, Cermella Gross &amp; Wagner, Knesiyat Hasechel, Ra’ash, Taarovet Eskot, Avtipus, and Noar Shulaim, were just the most noticeable bands of this period. An essential role in the rise of these bands and artists was the former Roxanne club in Tel Aviv, which hosted known artists and emerging artists of rock and alternative rock, exposing new bands to a growing audience. Since then, most of those bands have disbanded, but their members still continue to act in various music projects and mostly constitute the community of the Israeli music of the 2010s.

Notable in the field of Glam metal and Heavy metal was the band &quot;Stella Maris&quot; from Haifa, which began performing in the early 1990s. Stella Maris later integrated in the mainstream Israeli music scene and its vocalist, Pavlo Rosenberg, launched a solo career of his own.

Israel also developed a new style of rock/metal named Oriental metal, a crossover between death metal and doom metal, influenced by ancient Jewish traditions and the oriental culture both in lyrics and melody.

Two mid-1990s crises led to the decline of that early 1990s rock boom: First was the Arad festival disaster of July 1995, after which the popularity of these events declined. Then the nationally traumatic murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November that year, is largely considered to have shifted the whole cultural atmosphere of the country, and the prominence and success of the &quot;kicking&quot; rock of the early 1990s was replaced by more mellow directions. Yet, until the end of that decade, Israeli rock music kept its place as a central musical style, and important bands such as Hamachshefot and Monica Sex formed.

=== 2000s ===

Although Israeli rock became less popular in the 2000s, being edged out by Israeli pop, many new rock artists and bands emerged. Among the most prominent Israel rock bands of the 2000s are Beit HaBubot, playing melodic rock which focused on acoustic guitar, and Synergia, which had a melodic nu metal sound. Among the other successful emerging Israeli rock bands and artists of this decade were Girafot, Sheygets, Habiluim, Yoni Bloch, Hadag Nahash, Shy Nobleman, Vaadat Charigim and many more.

Many disbanded Israel rock bands began playing again during this decade, including T-Slam, Mofa Ha&#x27;arnavot Shel Dr. Kasper, Mercedes Band, Eifo HaYeled, Monica Sex, Mashina, etc.

At the end of the 2000s Mizrahi music gained massive popularity in Israel, further weakening the popularity of Israeli rock.

=== 2000-2010 ===
In the second decade of the 2000s, the creators of the classic rock style dwindled and songs that combine rock with pop and oriental music appeared. Prominent creators in this field are Dudu Tassa, who succeeds in combining the Iraqi folk music he grew up with at home with the alternative rock of the 90s, Keren Peles, who combines personal and exposed writing with rock arrangements alongside moving ballads, Hanan Ben Ari who broke out in this decade with rock songs of faith.

Also, the well-known rock artists continued to create - Aviv Gefen, with the albums &quot;Psifas&quot; (2012) and &quot;Sdakim&quot; (2014), Mosh Ben Ari with the albums &quot;Tistakel li Ba&#x27;enayim&quot; (2011) and &quot;As in Life&quot;. Avitar Banai released two successful albums in this decade - &quot;Yafa Kalevana&quot; and &quot;Leshonot Shel Esh&quot;, which were played a lot on the radio stations, and also had a successful collaboration together with Aviv Gefen in a joint show.

<doc id="1297960" wikidata="Q16821605" url="?curid=1297960" title="Rope trick effect">
<text>Rope trick is the term given by American nuclear physicist John Malik to the curious lines and spikes which emanate from the fireball of nuclear explosions under certain conditions, just after detonation.

==Description==

The adjacent photograph shows two unusual phenomena: bright spikes projecting from the bottom of the fireball, and the peculiar mottling of the expanding fireball surface.

The surface of the fireball, with a temperature over 20,000 Kelvin, emits huge amounts of visible light radiation, more than 100 times the intensity at the Sun&#x27;s surface. Anything solid in the area absorbs the light and rapidly heats. The &quot;rope tricks&quot; that protrude from the bottom of the fireball are caused by the heating, rapid vaporization and then expansion of guy wires that extend from the shot cab—the housing at the top of the bomb tower that contains the explosive device—to the ground. Malik observed that when the guy wires were painted black, spike formation was enhanced, and if it were painted with reflective paint or wrapped in aluminium foil, no spikes were observed – thus confirming the hypothesis that it is heating and vaporization of the rope, induced by exposure to high-intensity visible light radiation, which causes the effect. Because of the lack of guy wires, no &quot;rope trick&quot; effects were observed in surface-detonation tests, free-flying weapons tests, or underground tests.

The cause of a surface mottling is more complex. In the initial microseconds after the explosion, a fireball is formed around the bomb by the massive numbers of thermal x-rays released by the explosion process. These x-rays cannot travel very far in standard atmosphere before reacting with molecules in the air, so the result is a fireball that rapidly forms within about in diameter and does not expand. This is known as a &quot;radiatively driven&quot; fireball.

Inside the radiative fireball, the bomb itself is rapidly expanding due to the heat generated by the nuclear reactions. This moves outward at supersonic speeds, creating a hydrodynamic shock wave at its outer edge. After a brief period, this shock front reaches and then passes the initial radiative fireball. The shock wave contains so much energy that the compression heating created in the air causes it to glow. At the point in the explosion captured in the adjacent photo, the shock front has passed the original radiative fireball and has about twice its size.

In the first few microseconds after detonation, the bomb casing and shot cab are destroyed and vaporized. These vapors are accelerated to very high velocities, several tens of kilometers per second, faster than the shock front. However, this acceleration happens in a short period, so the material is trapped behind the shock front, even though it eventually travels faster than the shock front. The various light and dark patches are caused by the varying vapor density of the material splashing against the back of the shock front. The irregular variations in mass distribution around the bomb core create the mottled blob-like appearance.

==Sounding rockets==

After a few milliseconds, the energy of the shock front will no longer be great enough to heat the air into incandescence. At that point, the shock front becomes invisible, a process known as &quot;breakaway&quot;. This makes the shock wave difficult to diagnose beyond this boundary.

Photographs of nuclear tests often show numerous vertical rope-like lines to one side. These are typically created by small sounding rockets launched a few seconds before the firing, leaving smoke trails. The purpose of these trails is to record the passing of the now invisible shock wave, which causes an obvious visual effect on the smoke by compressing the air into a lens. This is not necessarily related to the rope trick effect in any physical way, but it is possible to confuse the two in some photographs. In the photograph of the Tumbler-Snapper test, the vertical lines in the lower-right corner are blast line poles, not smoke trails.

==Camera recording==
The photo was shot by a rapatronic camera (a high-speed camera invented by Harold Edgerton and colleagues) built by EG&amp;G. Each camera was capable of recording only one exposure on a single sheet of film. To create time-lapse sequences, banks of four to ten cameras were set up to take photos in rapid succession. The average exposure time was three microseconds.

<doc id="1297968" wikidata="Q94608609" url="?curid=1297968" title="Navajo Bridge">
<text>Navajo Bridge is the name of twin steel spandrel arch bridges that cross the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon National Park (near Lees Ferry) in northern Coconino County, Arizona, United States. The newer of the two spans carries vehicular traffic on U.S. Route 89A (US 89A) over Marble Canyon between Bitter Springs and Jacob Lake, allowing travel into a remote Arizona Strip region north of the Colorado River including the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.

Prior to completion of the first Navajo Bridge, one of the only Colorado River crossings between Arizona and Utah was located about upstream from the bridge site, at the mouth of Glen Canyon where Lees Ferry service had operated since 1873. The ferry site had been chosen as the only relatively easy access to the river for both northbound and southbound travelers. By the 1920s, automobile traffic began using the ferry, though it was not considered a safe and reliable crossing due to adverse weather and flooding regularly preventing its operation.

The bridge was officially named the Grand Canyon Bridge when it was dedicated on June 14–15, 1929. The state legislature changed the name to Navajo Bridge five years later in 1934. The original bridge was closed to vehicular traffic after the new span opened in 1995. The old span is still open for pedestrian and equestrian use.

The dual spans of Navajo Bridge are tied at ninth place among the highest bridges in the United States with nearly identical heights of for the original span, and for the second span.

==History==
Construction of the original Navajo Bridge began in 1927, and the bridge opened to traffic in 1929. The bridge was paid for by the nascent Arizona State Highway Commission (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) in cooperation with the United States Department of the Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Affairs, as the eastern landing is on the Navajo Nation. The steel spandrel bridge was designed and constructed by the Kansas City Structural Steel Company. During construction, worker Lane McDaniels died after falling to the Colorado River below. Supervisors had rejected the idea of rigging safety netting, believing that it would catch on fire from falling hot rivets.

The original bridge is in length, with a maximum height of from the canyon floor. The roadway offers an surface width with a load capacity of 22.5 tons (although the posted legal weight limit was 40 tons). During the design phase, a wider roadway was considered, but ultimately rejected, as it would have required a costly third arch to be added to the design, and the vehicles of the time did not require a wider road. When the Bridge officially opened on January 12, 1929, the Flagstaff paper proclaimed it &quot;the biggest news in Southwest history.&quot;

By 1984, however, Arizona Department of Transportation officials decided that the traffic flow was too great for the original bridge and that a new solution was needed. The sharp corners in the roadway on each side of the approach had become a safety hazard due to low visibility, and deficiencies resulting from the original design&#x27;s width and load capacity specifications were becoming problematic. The bridge had also become part of US 89A.

Deciding on a solution was difficult, due to the many local interests. Issues included preservation of sacred Navajo land, endangered plant species in Marble Canyon, and the possibility of construction debris entering the river. The original proposal called for merely widening and fortifying the 1928 bridge, but this was ultimately rejected as not sufficient to meet contemporary federal highway standards. Replacement became the only option, and it was eventually decided to entirely discontinue vehicular traffic on the original bridge. A new bridge would be built immediately next to the original and have a considerably similar visual appearance, but would conform to modern highway codes.

The new steel arch bridge was commissioned by the Arizona Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, and was completed in May 1995, at a cost of $14.7 million. A formal dedication was held on September 14, 1995.

The original Navajo Bridge is still open to pedestrian and equestrian use, and an interpretive center has been constructed on the west side to showcase the historical nature of the bridge and early crossing of the Colorado River. The original bridge has been designated as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1981.

California condors were reintroduced to the area in 1996 and can sometimes be seen on and around Navajo Bridge.

<text>Cleveland is a community in Klickitat County, Washington. It is located within the Bickleton CDP.

Cleveland was first settled in 1879 by Ripley Dodge, who named it for the city of his native state of Ohio.

Cleveland contains an old cemetery and a rodeo. The rodeo, the oldest in the state, has been completely refurbished. Also on the rodeo grounds is a 100-year-old Spillman carousel that has been completely refurbished thanks to grants and private funds. The closest town is Bickleton. An annual rodeo is held the 2nd weekend in June along with Pioneer days in which the carousel is restored to operating conditions as it was back in 1907, with the original carousel horses which are housed in the Museum in Bickleton.

Cleveland is home to a carousel. Per R. Bollinger, former owner of The Oaks amusement park and benefactor of the Oaks Park Association (the non-profit he set up to perpetuate The Oaks), the carousel was one of the few rides owned by The Oaks when it opened May 30, 1905. It was sold to the Bickleton/Cleveland group in 1928 along with the band organ and ticket booth. Over the years, the method used to turn this machine was modified from using donkeys or small horses to a steam engine and, later, a tractor engine. The communities of Bickleton and Cleveland have kept the carousel maintained throughout the years.

Cleveland&#x27;s most famous resident was William O. Douglas, the longest sitting member of the U.S. Supreme Court. Douglas&#x27;s father was a Presbyterian minister, and moved the family to Cleveland from California in order to serve the local residents, but when he died, the family moved to Yakima.

<doc id="1297997" wikidata="Q4872637" url="?curid=1297997" title="Kleinburg">
<text>Kleinburg is an unincorporated village in the city of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is home to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, an art gallery with a focus on the Group of Seven, and the Kortright Centre for Conservation. In 2001, the village and its surrounding communities had a population of 4,595; the village itself has 282 dwellings, with a population of 952. Kleinburg comprises a narrow section of hilly landscape situated between two branches of the Humber River. The historic village is bounded by Highway 27 on the west and Stegman’s Mill Road to the east. Kleinburg has subsumed the nearby hamlet of Nashville, but it has not itself been fully subsumed into the main urban area of Vaughan.

==Geography==
The village is located between two branches of the Humber River, and features dense forests throughout its 1.05 km² of land area. Its northern and western peripheries are primarily agricultural.

==History==
The community was founded in 1848 by John Nicholas Kline (1825–1854), a German-Canadian settler. A direct translation of the German word &quot;Kleinburg&quot; is &#x27;small castle&#x27;. Residents argue that the community of Kleinburg could be named after its founder or after its landscape (although the latter would necessitate the spelling &quot;Kleinberg&quot;, which is German for &#x27;small mountain&#x27;).

In its early days, Kleinburg was dependent on its many flour and wheat mills, located off the Humber River.

Kleinburg has historically been a small, quiet town, but it now attracts many affluent visitors and residents. Housing developments began during the 1950s in the west and continued during the 1970s in the southeast of Kleinburg. Other developments occurred during 1993 in the south, 1998 in the northeast, and during the 2000s in the north. During its major expansion in the 1990s and early 2000s, many new large homes were built.

==Main Street==
The historic commercial district of Kleinburg along Islington Avenue has many heritage buildings, as well as modern developments with mixed residential and commercial uses. Main street has local shops, restaurants, and national chains including Royal Bank. Its oldest extant building, built in 1867, is home of The Doctor&#x27;s House restaurant.

Local attractions include the McMichael Art Gallery, Kortright Centre, Humber River Trails, Bindertwine Park, Pierre Berton Heritage Centre, and Copper Creek Golf Course.

==Politics==
Kleinburg is not an incorporated entity; it has no political jurisdiction and no geopolitically-defined boundaries. Residents vote for a councillor in ward 1 of Vaughan City Council.

The community of Nashville, though distinct from Kleinburg, is considered part of Kleinburg. Residents of Nashville receive many of their services, such as postal and medical services, within Kleinburg.

==Education==
Most non-Catholic students were once bused to nearby King City Secondary School in King City. Since the opening of Emily Carr Secondary School, busing was eliminated, forcing students to walk far to get to the school as not even public busing services the area. There are not enough students for Kleinburg&#x27;s own secondary school. In 2008, the oldest and most historical school, Kleinburg Public Elementary school, was demolished and a new public elementary school by the same name was built and opened in September 2009. There are 5 schools in Kleinburg:
*Kleinburg Christian Academy (Private Elementary)
*Kleinburg Public Elementary School (Public Elementary)
*Ecole La Fontaine (French Public Elementary School)
*Montessori School of Kleinburg (Private School)
*The Hill Academy (Private Secondary for student-athletes)- moved to Caledon
*Pope Francis Catholic School (Public Catholic School)

==Parks and recreation==
Kleinburg is home to several parks, all of which are operated by the city of Vaughan&#x27;s Parks and Forestry Operations.

* Bindertwine Park
* Butterfly Heights
* East Corners Park
* Ross Gurreri Park
* Secord Park
* Summit Park
* Tinsmith Parkette
* Treelawn Parkette
* Wishing Well Park
* Woodgate Park
While Kleinburg does not have its own community centre, its residents make use of the Al Palladini Community Centre, located in nearby Woodbridge.

==Culture==
Binder Twine is a festival held annually that attracts 25,000 people on average. This tradition began in 1890 by Charles Shaw Jr. who distributed binder twine to local farmers. Kleinburg also has a Christmas tree lighting celebration where the community comes together to donate to &quot;The Red Bow Campaign&quot; and the &quot;KARA Holiday Food Drive&quot; while waiting for the lighting of the tree in front of the Kline house. There is also &quot;Canada Day in Kleinburg&quot; and Cartunes in Kleinburg events which allow the community to celebrate the history of the village.

==In film==
Kleinburg is home to the Cinespace Film Studios (formerly Toronto International Film Studios), a centre for television and motion picture production. The TV show &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot; was filmed here from 1963 to 1965. A reunion was held at the studios in June, 2013 with Gordon Pinsent and nine junior rangers in attendance.

Other films shot at the studio between 1960 and 1990 include: &quot;The Fox&quot;, &quot;The First Time&quot;, &quot;Recommendation for Mercy&quot;, &quot;Shoot&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Blood City&quot;, &quot;Death Weekend&quot;, &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, &quot;Rituals&quot;, &quot;Riel&quot;, &quot;Fish Hawk&quot;, &quot;The Amateur&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Love at Stake&quot;. Television shows filmed here include: &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Bay&quot;, &quot;Hatch&#x27;s Mill&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Timothy Pilgrim&quot;, &quot;Search and Rescue&quot;, &quot;Matt and Jenny&quot;, &quot;The Great Detective&quot; and &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;.

Downtown Kleinburg and the farmland surrounding it featured significantly in the 1st season of the 1971 television series, &quot;Dr. Simon Locke&quot;.

In 2006, the movie &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was filmed at the McMichael Art Gallery. In the movie, all of the Camp David scenes, both indoor and outdoor, were filmed on the grounds of the McMichael Art Gallery, most notably the scene on the &quot;Wedding Hill&quot; where they filmed the president&#x27;s helicopter taking off and being shot down by a missile (the explosion was added in after using special effects).

In 2015, Cinespace moved out of the studios they had been renting. The Vaughan Sports Centre, a private company, has repurposed them as baseball training facilities.

==Notable residents==
Kleinburg was home to Canadian author Pierre Berton for nearly 50 years until his death in 2004, and to his friend and business associate John G. McClelland, co-founder of McClelland &amp; Stewart. Kleinburg was also the home of former prime minister Lester B. Pearson. Stephen Lecce, an Ontario MPP and minister of various portfolios first elected in 2018, lived in Kleinburg at the time of his service as a provincial politician.

<doc id="1298010" wikidata="Q2896240" url="?curid=1298010" title="Yehuda Krinsky">
<text>Chaim Yehuda (&quot;Yudel&quot;) Krinsky (born December 3, 1933, in Boston, Massachusetts) is a rabbi and a leader in the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. He served in various positions of the movement&#x27;s administrative staff since 1954, and as a personal secretary to its chief rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, and is chairman of the movement&#x27;s main institutions.

In 1988, after Schneerson&#x27;s wife died, he named Krinsky sole executor of his will, later probated and recorded in New York.

As of 2004, Krinsky was among the most influential figures within the Chabad movement.

==Biography==
Krinsky grew up in Dorchester, Massachusetts and was educated at the Boston Latin School. At the age of 12, he was sent by his parents to study at the Central Lubavitch Yeshiva in Brooklyn, where he received his rabbinic ordination. He joined the Lubavitcher Rebbe&#x27;s staff in 1952 as a driver.

==Activities==
In 1956 Krinsky was invited by Schneerson to join his secretariat, headed by Chaim Mordechai Aizik Hodakov. Krinsky&#x27;s position included work on behalf of the Merkos L&#x27;Inyonei Chinuch, the educational arm of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. At that time, Schneerson also appointed Krinsky to direct the Lubavitch News Service, including disseminating Schneerson&#x27;s talks around the world via satellite.

In 1970, Shneerson appointed Krinsky to the administrative boards of the movement&#x27;s umbrella organization, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, its educational arm, Merkos L&#x27;Inyonei Chinuch and its social-services arm, Machne Israel.

Schneerson selected Krinsky to serve as the official secretary of the movement&#x27;s three central organizations, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, Merkos L&#x27;Inyonei Chinuch, and Machneh Israel, the movement&#x27;s social services arm.

==Family==
Krinsky married Devorah Kasinetz, daughter of Rabbi Zev and Ethel Kasinetz. Their children are:
*Rabbi Levi Krinsky, director of Chabad of New Hampshire
*Rabbi Hillel David Krinsky, who is married to Shterna Sarah Garelik, daughter of Rabbi Gershon Mendel Garelik, Chief Chabad Emissary of Milan, Italy. And is the founder of Jewish Educational Media.
*Menachem Mendel Krinsky, who is married to Miriam Turner of Chicago
*Rabbi Shmaya Krinsky, who is married to Rivkah Gutnick, daughter of Australian commodities magnate Joseph Gutnick
*Sheine B. Krinsky, who is married to Rabbi Yosef B. Friedman, associate director of the Kehot Publication Society
*Chana Krinsky, who is married to Rabbi Joseph Futerfas, director of Camp Gan Israel, New York

==Recognition==
Krinsky appeared in several lists of influential American Jews, including the Forward 50 in 2005.

From 2007 to 2013, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine compiled an annual list of the fifty most influential rabbis in the United States. Krinsky was in the top five every year.

<doc id="1298016" wikidata="Q3437862" url="?curid=1298016" title="Rock music in Norway">
<text>Rock music arrived in Norway following the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll musical revolution in the USA and Great Britain in the late 1950s. Norwegian rock quickly fostered capable musicians, but was strongly influenced by the Anglo-American starting point for the musical form. The leading Norwegian rock groups in the 1960s and 1970s largely expressed themselves in English, while Norwegian was long only used in the more traditional hit and pop music. Notable Norwegian rock bands include Titanic, a-ha, and Kaizers Orchestra.

==1950s and 1960s==
The most known rock and roll performers in the 1950s were Per Granberg, Per Hartvig (Rocke-Pelle), Jan Rohde and Odd Gisløy (&quot;Smiling Tommy&quot;). Gisløy even penned his own rock and roll composition: &quot;Dancing with My Rockin&#x27; Shoes&quot;.

In the early 1960s the so-called Shadow bands (named after the British instrumental group The Shadows) were popular. Among the most notable were The Beatniks and The Vanguards. In the mid-1960s The Pussycats recorded two albums: one in Great Britain and one in West Germany, both produced by Sven-Erik Børja. Most of the songs were composed by group member Trond Graff.

==1970s and 1980s==
Titanic reached # 5 on the UK singles chart in 1971. Norway also has a notable progressive rock scene, which began in 1971 with the release of Junipher Greene&#x27;s &quot;Friendship&quot;, the country&#x27;s first double album.

Beginning in the mid-1970s it slowly became more acceptable to sing in Norwegian. One of the foremost pioneers of rock in Norwegian was the &quot;trønder rocker&quot; Åge Aleksandersen. This movement was also combined with experimentation in combining elements from folk and old dance music into rock. More progressive bands like Folque incorporated elements of traditional Norwegian folk music in their recordings. Other bands include Ruphus, Aunt Mary and Høst. This scene was in large part fueled by the success Frank Zappa had in Norway.

On July 20, 1977, the Sex Pistols played a concert at the Penguin Club in Oslo; they also played in Trondheim that month. These shows brought punk to Norway, inspiring a Norwegian punk rock scene. The first Norwegian punk bands make their record debuts during 1979. In the punk scene it is not clear which band released the first Norwegian punk single release; the top candidates are Pink Dirt, Graxelaget, Front Page, Kjøtt, Oslo Børs, and Børres Kork. Trygve Mathiesen concludes that it was Børres Kork who&#x27;s single had the earliest release date. In 1982 the Blitz-huset in Oslo was established, and that remained a center of the punk scene throughout the 1980s. There was also a punk milieu in Trondheim associated with the Hard Rock Kafé, which produced bands like Wannskrækk and Liliedugg. Punk continues to have an active scene in Norway, centered around the Blitz in Oslo and the UFFA house in Trondheim. Other cities including Bergen, Stavanger, Bodø, and Tromsø have also had smaller but active scenes. Bands such as Raga Rockers, DumDum Boys, Honningbarna, and Kvelertak have clear influences from the punk scene.

In the 80s Norway had A-Ha, Artch, Return, Stage Dolls and TNT, the first Norwegian band to be featured on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In the latter years of this decade a new generation of bands started to gain popularity. These were bands who sang in Norwegian. Here Norway got the &quot;4 great ones&quot;: DumDum Boys, DeLillos, Raga Rockers and Jokke &amp; Valentinerne. All these bands except Jokke (Joachim &quot;Jokke&quot; Nielsen died in 2000) are still active.

==Since 1990==
More recently, the Norwegian rock-scene has been dominated internationally by bands such as Turbonegro, Gluecifer and Madrugada, but several bands (like BigBang, Euroboys and Span) concentrate on the domestic market. The Stavanger hard rock band Kvelertak has been touring around the world with Purified in Blood among others since the release of their self-titled debut album in 2010.

In the mid 1980’s &amp; early 1990s, Norway saw the growing of the underground black metal scene, which eventually became the Early Norwegian black metal scene with bands including Mayhem, Immortal, Enslaved, Darkthrone, Burzum, Gorgoroth, Satyricon, Solefald, and Dimmu Borgir. Industrial rock band Zeromancer was formed in 1999. A few members were formerly in the band Seigmen.

Since 2001, Kaizers Orchestra has been among the most important rock bands in Norway. The band employs a variety of unusual instruments including a pump organ and an accordion. They are known for their use of oil barrels, car wheels, and garbage cans as percussion instruments.

<text>Rock music and its subgenres are very popular in Portugal. The history of the Portuguese [[rock and roll|rock]] music scene spans several decades.

==History==

===1950s to 1970s===
In the late 1950s, singer Joaquim Costa was one of the first rock artists, but it was only during the 1960s that the genre&#x27;s popularity began rising, with bands such as &quot;Quinteto Académico&quot; and &quot;Sheiks&quot;, who played mostly in clubs and student associations. Most of these groups played covers of American and British bands or were influenced by artists such as the Beatles and The Shadows. The rock scene&#x27;s development was limited in its commercial and creative scope due to the country&#x27;s isolation, which was under a fascist dictatorship until 1974.

During the 1970s, and particularly after democracy was established after the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal became home to an active progressive rock scene, which included bands like Tantra, Petrus Castrus, Banda do Casaco and the highly successful Quarteto 1111. During the latter part of the decade, José Cid, Quarteto 1111&#x27;s vocalist and keyboardist, pursued a solo career, releasing the landmark symphonic album &quot;10,000 Anos Depois Entre Venus E Marte&quot; before turning to mainstream pop music. Portugal&#x27;s progressive rock epoch came to a close with the release of &quot;Ascenção e Queda&quot;, a rock opera by Petrus Castrus. Most of these records remain in short supply to this date.

Until the end of the 1970s, Portuguese folk music and protest songs were generally the most popular types of music - but gradually more rock bands and styles began to appear, benefiting from the country&#x27;s new-found openness.

===1980s===
Rock music finally hit the mainstream in 1980 with the release of &quot;Ar de Rock&quot; by Rui Veloso, which was the first popular Portuguese rock album.

During the 1980s, Veloso&#x27;s blues-rock sound achieved national success and inspired the creation of several rock and roll bands, which became popular with youths growing up in the post-1974 modernized Portugal. The success of groups like Taxi, Heróis do Mar and Trabalhadores do Comércio,and UHF,indicated that a solid rock scene was growing, despite the fact that these were all relatively ephemeral projects.

Xutos &amp; Pontapés are arguably the biggest success case in the Portuguese rock scene, having become the first band in the country to celebrate 30 years of career. Their early works had close roots to punk rock and rockabilly, but later incorporated hard rock and folk influences into their sound, becoming more diverse. UHF, another band that started in the early 80s, visually resembled the hard rock-playing hair bands that popped up in America and Europe - however, like Xutos, their sound was derived mainly from punk rock and folk influences.

Other major projects from this period include GNR, Roxigénio, Taxi and Peste &amp; Sida, which turned to ska as an inspiration and would later switch to punk. GNR abandoned ska after two years when they changed vocalists, adopting poetic, and nonsensical lyrics, and a bigger use of synthpop sounds.

Heavy Metal began building up a following among the younger generation living and bands proliferated, especially in the North of the country. Few made it to the studio and those that did released mostly low budget singles. 1982 saw the first release of a Heavy Metal LP in the country, &quot;Forte e Feio&quot; by NZZN, but the production was poor and the record was not well received by critics. The late 1980s saw the rise of Tarantula, probably the first Portuguese Heavy Metal band with relevant impact outside the country.

During the mid-1980s, synthpop became even more prevalent in Portuguese rock, with the success of Sétima Legião and Heróis do Mar, which were heavily influenced by acts such as Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode and Gary Numan. Combining synthesized sounds and beats with Portuguese lyrics exalting the country&#x27;s history, they attracted controversy and were accused of being political reactionaries and supportive of the extinct dictatorial regime. Heróis do Mar disbanded in 1990, but their momentum was taken over by other projects influenced not only by new wave, but also alternative rock and indie rock: Rádio Macau, Mler Ife Dada and Pop Dell&#x27;Arte, among others.

Punk rock remained mostly an underground phenomenon, although a circuit of venues and events in the country&#x27;s major cities grew during this decade. Relevant punk bands to emerge during this period include Censurados, Mata Ratos and Peste &amp; Sida.

Although most bands from this period were short-lived and none achieved international success, 1980&#x27;s Portuguese rock was extremely diverse - each major band developed their own signature sound, and the national rock scene became very rich, spanning a wide variety of themes and styles.

===1990s===
The 1990s were also a very creative and active decade, with openness to new trends and a growth in the music market marked by the increasing popularity of international music festivals that attracted major rock bands to the country. A handful of major 1980s rock artists (such as Rui Veloso, GNR, Xutos &amp; Pontapés) managed to maintain and grow their careers and fan bases.

This decade was notable for the rise of very active heavy metal, underground and alternative rock scenes.

Several major bands from the 1990s achieved both national and international success and were able to continue their careers into the 21st century, including Moonspell (an internationally renowned gothic / heavy metal band from Lisbon), Mão Morta (alternative and experimental rock project with a considerable cult following), Blasted Mechanism (a theatrical, sci-fi themed band that mixes rock with electronica, reggae and dub), Zen (alternative rock band), Ena Pá 2000 (a comedy rock outfit) and Da Weasel (a rock/hip-hop fusion band).

While some of the 1990s signature rock genres such as grunge, industrial rock and nu metal were very popular with Portuguese youngsters, few Portuguese bands fully adopted these styles and none achieved great success. Exceptions include Da Weasel (who incorporated elements of nu metal in their later albums), Blind Zero (pop/rock band that started out as a grunge outfit) and Bizarra Locomotiva (industrial metal band with a sizable cult following).

On the mainstream front (pop/rock), Quinta do Bill, a folk-rock group, achieved some notoriety, and two other bands rose to prominence: Silence 4, an English-singing pop/rock act from Leiria, and Ornatos Violeta, a Portuguese-singing rock band from Porto. Despite huge national success, critical acclaim (particularly for Ornatos Violeta) and lasting influence, both groups disbanded at the turn of the millennium.

===2000s===
Much like in other European and Anglo-American countries, the decade starting in 2001 saw the rise of hip-hop, dance music and more pop-oriented acts, with audiences for rock music dwindling.

Established bands who had begun their careers during the 1980s (Rui Veloso, Xutos &amp; Pontapés) and 1990s (Moonspell, Blasted Mechanism, Mão Morta) maintained thriving careers, although the rock music scene became more fragmented and directed at niche markets. Some popular groups and projects surfaced: Toranja (pop/rock, Lisbon), Wraygunn (blues-rock collective from Coimbra) and Legendary Tiger Man (WrayGunn vocalist Paulo Furtado&#x27;s solo project), and pop/rock acts influenced by electronic music such as Micro Audio Waves and Mesa.
Clã, another Portuguese-singing pop/rock act who had surfaced in Porto during the mid-1990s, scored their biggest commercial hits during the 2000s decade.

===2010s===
The trend continued into the 2010s, with new bands appearing and playing in a variety of rock subgenres including pop/rock (Amor Electro, Diabo na Cruz, Capitão Fausto, and Salvador Sobral&#x27;s band Alexander Search), blues-rock (Black Mamba), alternative and indie rock (PAUS, peixe : avião, Linda Martini, WhosPuto), as well as heavy metal (Serrabulho, Okkultist). This decade also saw a niche revival of psychedelic and stoner rock with artists like Black Wizards, The Quartet of Woah! and krautrock-influenced band 10000 Russos.

<text>Kaupō is a district of ancient Hawaii (&quot;moku&quot; in the Hawaiian language) of Maui island in Hawaii. Kaupō is a remote, sparsely populated, sustainable ranching community.

== Geography ==
Kaupō is located along the southeastern shore of Maui, west of Kīpahulu along the Kahikinui coastline. Kaupō is located on a rugged and desolate coast. The &quot;Kahikinui Forest Reserve&quot; is located in the area, as well as a section of Haleakalā National Park. A trail leads from near the summit of Haleakalā through Kaupō Gap to the coast. This trail has been designated as a National Recreation Trail.

Kaupō is connected to the rest of the island via the Pi&#x27;ilani Highway (Hawaii Route 31). The highway is primarily one lane wide and is not paved in all sections.

== History ==

Kaupō was &quot;Wahipana&quot; (Special Place) for ancient Hawaiians. In the early 1900s many families lived in Kaupō. Fishing, farming, hunting and ranching were primary occupations. In 1859 the district was combined with that of Hana.

The Loaloa Heiau and Huialoha Church are located there.

==Education==
Residents are served by public schools of the Hawaii Department of Education (HIDOE).

Kaupo School served the community from its 1923 opening until the 1960s. By 1964 the number of students was five, so the HIDOE closed the school with Hana High and Elementary School in Hana taking the students. The school reopened in circa 1982 as some landslides that happened that year obstructed the road to Hana. Kaupo School later closed when the road reopened.

<doc id="1298045" wikidata="Q1350160" url="?curid=1298045" title="Caupo of Turaida">
<text>Caupo of Turaida, Kaupo or Kaupo Lieven, sometimes Kubbe (died 21 September 1217) was a leader of the Finnic-speaking Livonian people in the beginning of the 13th century, in what are now parts of Latvia and Estonia by the Gulf of Riga. He is sometimes called a &#x27;King of Livonia&#x27;, the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia refers to him as &quot;quasi rex&quot;, &#x27;like a king.

He is considered to be the progenitor of the Lieven family.

==Biography==

He was most likely born in the Swedish settlement of Kaup in modern-day Kaliningrad, presumably a descendant of Varangians who participated in the founding of Kievan Rus’. 

Caupo was the first prominent Livonian to be christened. He was probably baptized around 1191 by Theoderic of Turaida, a preacher who would later become the abbot of Daugavgrīva Abbey. He became an ardent Christian and a friend of Albert of Buxhoeveden, Bishop of Riga, who, in 1203–1204, took him on a journey to Rome and introduced him to Pope Innocent III. The Pope was impressed by the converted pagan chief and presented him a Bible, hundred gold pieces, ennobled him and gave him the name “Lieven.” When he returned from the journey, his tribe rebelled against him and Caupo took part in a siege of his former fortress in Turaida in 1212. The wooden fort was rebuilt two years later out of brick and stone, closer to its present surviving form.

Caupo participated in a crusader raid against the still pagan Estonians and was killed in the Battle of St. Matthew&#x27;s Day in 1217, fighting against the troops of the Estonian leader Lembitu of Lehola. Caupo had male successors, his son Bertold had been killed 1210 in the Battle of Ümera. His grandson, Nicholas, was the first descendant who started using the name Lieven more frequently. 

Modern Estonians, Latvians, and remaining Livonians do not have a singular view about the historical role of Caupo. Baltic nationalists generally consider him a negative figure and a traitor to his people, however, such claims are sometimes dismissed by scholars as applying a modern viewpoint to a medieval chieftain. Some Latvian folk tales name him &quot;Kaupo the accursed, the scourge of the Livs... Kaupo who has sold his soul to the foreign bishops.&quot;

<text>Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CSAO) is the commonly used name for modern-day Conrail (reporting mark CRCX), an American railroad company. It operates three networks, the North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit Shared Assets Areas, where it serves as a contract local carrier and switching company for its owners, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway. When most of the former Conrail&#x27;s track was split between these two railroads, the three shared assets areas (a total of about 1,200 miles of track) were kept separate to avoid giving one railroad an advantage in those areas. The company operates using its own employees and infrastructure but owns no equipment outside MOW equipment.

==North Jersey Shared Assets Area==
The North Jersey Shared Assets Area stretches from the North Bergen Yard in North Bergen, New Jersey south into Jersey City and Newark, and beyond to Manville (Port Reading Junction) and Trenton, much of which is operated over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and New Jersey Transit lines through trackage rights. Primary connections are to CSX&#x27;s River Subdivision north to Albany, New York at North Bergen, NS&#x27;s Southern Tier Line northwest to Buffalo, New York at Croxton Yard in Jersey City, NS&#x27;s Lehigh Line west to Allentown, Pennsylvania and CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision southwest to Philadelphia at Manville, and the Conrail South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area at Trenton. Oak Island Yard in Newark is the principal yard for the region with smaller ones at Bayonne, Greenville (Jersey City), Linden, Manville, Metuchen, Newark, Old Bridge, and Port Reading in Woodbridge.

<text>Siren is the third studio album by Heather Nova, released in 1998.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;The singer and three different producers have combined folk-rock guitar, discreet synthbeats and lush keyboards and strings into a deftly eclectic contemporary sound. The only time this slick pop-rock doesn&#x27;t upstage Nova&#x27;s sensibility, however, is when she&#x27;s dispensing the breathless come-ons of songs like &#x27;Make You Mine&#x27;.&quot;

AllMusic concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s Nova&#x27;s unique vocal style and winning pop sensibilities that make &quot;Siren&quot; work as well as it does, doing double duty as substantive singer/songwriter statement and perfect pop-radio product.&quot;

<doc id="1298054" wikidata="Q515603" url="?curid=1298054" title="Sapelo Island">
<text>Sapelo Island is a state-protected barrier island located in McIntosh County, Georgia. The island is accessible only by boat; the primary ferry comes from the Sapelo Island Visitors Center in McIntosh County, Georgia, a seven-mile (11 km), twenty-minute trip. It is the site of Hog Hammock, the last known Gullah community. Access to the island is restricted to residents, landowners, or guests thereof. Public access must be obtained by getting a permit issued by state tourism authorities.

Approximately 97 percent of the island is owned by the state of Georgia and is managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources; the remainder is under private ownership. The western perimeter of Sapelo is the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve (SINERR) which is part of NOAA&#x27;s National Estuarine Research Reserve system (NERR). The University of Georgia Marine Institute, which is focused on research and education, is located on on the south end of the island. The Reynolds Mansion, a Georgia State Park, also lies on the south end of the island. Visitors to the island must be a part of an organized tour or guests of residents on the island.

==Hog Hammock==

The community of Hog Hammock, also known as Hogg Hummock, includes homes, a general store, bar, public library, and other small businesses including vacation rentals. There are two active church congregations in Hog Hammock: St. Luke Baptist Church, founded in 1885, and First African Baptist Church, established in 1866. The latter congregation has an older building known as First African Baptist Church at Raccoon Bluff, constructed in 1900 in the former Raccoon Bluff community north of Hog Hammock. It is used for special services and programs.

Many of the full-time inhabitants of the Hog Hammock Community are African Americans known as Gullah-Geechees, specifically Saltwater Geechees, who descended from enslaved native West African people brought to the island in the 1700s and 1800s to work on island plantations. The current population of full-time Gullah-Geechee residents in the community is estimated to be 47 (2009). The residents must bring all supplies from the mainland or purchase them in the small store on the island. The children of Hog Hammock take the ferry to the mainland and then take a bus to school, as the island school closed in 1978.

Hog Hammock is also home to the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society, Inc. (SICARS), a non-profit organization whose mission is to preserve and revitalize the Hogg Hummock Community. SICARS was founded in 1993 by Hogg Hummock residents and non-resident descendants who wanted to enhance the future of their community by educating all visitors to the island about the history and to increase awareness that Sapelo has existed as an African community for over 200 years. SICARS was incorporated in 1994, has over 600 members, and continues to grow each year. The organization hosts a Cultural Day festival every third Saturday in October.

The entire of the community was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as Hog Hammock Historic District.

In the 1990s, people from the mainland began acquiring parcels of land from the Gullah-Geechee people to construct vacation homes. In 2012, McIntosh County property tax appraisers notified Hog Hammock residents of huge property tax increases, even though there was no longer a school on the island and the DNR manages and pays for water, trash removal, and the ferry and barge system. There are no emergency services on the island, everything is volunteer-run by the residents and state staff. One Hog Hammock property owner&#x27;s annual tax bill soared from $600 to $2,100.

In 2013, a legal fight over the sudden tax hikes was well underway, with some residents claiming they would be driven from land they had owned for many generations for the benefit of mainlanders who would acquire more of Hog Hammock&#x27;s homes. The major paved roadways on the island were unmaintained by the county and had significant issues with flooding and overflowing ditch networks. A resolution was agreed, on which the county was to pay for new equipment for a volunteer fire station and revamp an aging building for a community center.

In 2023, McIntosh County again came under legal issues with the Hog Hammock community and Sapelo Island. They issued a zoning ordinance update which changed the historic area’s mandated restriction of only 1,400 sq ft indoor space to 3,200 sq ft. This came after a local non-descendant, Bill Hodges, who is also on the McIntosh County Industry and Development Authority Board, filed a complaint that he could not build a large enough vacation home for his family. This in turn led to McIntosh County Planning proposing a rather radical ordinance in contrast to their Comprehensive Plan, which stated it would protect the historic nature of Hog Hammock community. 
The community’s residents were barred from bringing recording equipment or phones into the public hearing for the new ordinance and the hearing was set with very little notice and after the last ferry left for the island that day, leaving many residents to choose between attending the hearing and sleeping in their home for the night.

Numerous complaints were heard, including officials from the state about the lack of capacity in the water system for larger homes, from residents about the changing historic nature of the island and the tax hike that would result, and from scientists stating the flooding would increase in the community from the added weight of larger homes, and from religious leaders who stated Hog Hammock was a religious center for Muslim and Christians alike and allowing large vacation homes and the other proposed changes would result in less affordable options for current historic homeowners. McIntosh County planning department pushed the ordinance forward anyways, stating that the commissioners could vote to send it back to them to fix all of the obvious problems instead of pulling the ordinance and reworking it with the community. They reassured the community several times stating that the commission would return it back to them to fix the issues, but they had to go ahead with it as written for now. Numerous lawyers present commented on the situation as the meetings procedure was “extremely out of the ordinary for a public hearing” and did not keep with Ga laws and regulations for “numerous reasons”.

At the first of two commission meetings, which were held not even 3 days later and again held after the last ferry left for the day, the public comment period was fraught with controversy and outcry. Then some of the county commissioners and the county manager maintained that the county was trying to keep residents happy and allow progress in the protected community, but several accused Commissioners of not abiding by their own regulations and comprehensive planning process to abide new developers&#x27; interests in the island over the residents. The County Manager, Patrick Zoucks, publicly accused the DNR of causing the issue as public lands in the states holding are not on the tax bracket in the county, forcing the county to be desperate for funds. He posted this to the county Facebook page and in newspaper articles.

After several complaints were filed, the press and recording devices were then allowed for the last commissioners meeting- during which the commission voted for the ordinance to be passed in a 3-2 vote. Three in favor were of the vote were the Chairman at the time, David Stevens, Commissioner Kate Karwacki (a local realtor), and Commissioner at large Davis Poole. The two votes not in favor were of Commissioner William E. Harrell and Commissioner Roger Lotson, whose district actually holds Sapelo Island and who had been on the island and seen firsthand why 3,400 sq ft homes would not work logistically. In a controversial move, Commissioner David Stevens ended the meeting after the vote by saying that “this new generation [on Sapelo] just didn’t have it” and insulted the community saying this was their own fault for “being greedy” and selling their land to developers to begin with. Numerous complaints, legal challenges, and referendums have now been filed and are still pending.

===2024 ferry gangway collapse===

On October 19, 2024, a gangway to a ferry at a marina collapsed during a Sapelo Island Cultural Day celebration, killing 7 and injuring another 8. Several people are also reported to be missing.

==History==

Sapelo Island is speculated to be the site of San Miguel de Gualdape, the short-lived (1526–1527) first European settlement in the present-day United States, and if true, it would also be the first place in the present-day U.S. that a Catholic mass was celebrated.

Sapelo, a name of Indian origin, was known to the Spanish as Zapala. During the 17th century, the island was part of the Guale missionary province of Spanish Florida. After 1680, several missions were merged and moved to the island under the mission Santa Catalina de Guale.
In the early 19th century, Thomas Spalding, a future senator and U.S. Representative, bought the island and developed it into a plantation, selling live oak for shipbuilding, introducing irrigation ditches, and cultivating Sea Island Cotton, corn, and sugar cane. Spalding brought 400 slaves to the island from West Africa and the West Indies to work the plantation and build what became the Spalding Mansion.

One of the slaves owned by Thomas Spalding was Bilali Muhammad, an Islamic scholar from West Africa who wrote a 13-page document about Islamic law on the island — possibly the first manuscript of Islamic law written in the United States.

In 1820, a Winslow Lewis brick lighthouse was built on the island. Although it remained dark for over 90 years, it was restored and relit in 1998.

Spalding opposed the abolition of slavery, and he died in 1851 returning from a convention to assert Georgia&#x27;s position on the matter. When freed, the former slaves established several settlements on the island; the last remaining is Hog Hammock, with approximately 70 remaining land owners. During the Civil War, the Spalding home was heavily vandalized and lay in ruins.

By the early 20th century, the International Road Races were attracting notables from the motor world to Savannah, Georgia. One attendee was Howard E. Coffin, founder of the Hudson Motor Car Company. Coffin purchased the entire island, except for the land owned by the former slaves, for $150,000 in 1912. Like Spalding, the Coffins embarked on numerous projects. Miles of shell-covered roads were laid, creeks were bridged, old fields were cultivated and large tracts were set aside for cattle grazing. The Coffins also renovated and enlarged the Spalding house, creating an island paradise unsurpassed on the coast. Former presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover as well as aviator Charles Lindbergh were guests in the home.

Tobacco heir Richard Joshua Reynolds Jr., of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company bought Sapelo from Coffin in 1934 during the Great Depression, and continued the tradition of agricultural experimentation of the previous owners. Reynolds and his family used his private island paradise as a part-time residence for three decades, consolidating the island&#x27;s African-American residents into Hog Hammock. Many worked as servants in South End House, later renamed the Reynolds Mansion by the State of Georgia.

=== Ecology research ===
In 1923, Sapelo owner Howard Coffin introduced imported chachalacas from Mexico to diversify the game bird population for his hunting pals. These chicken-like birds have established a stable, non-native population of 30 to 40 that at times has spread to neighboring islands.

Sapelo owner R.J. Reynolds, Jr. founded the Sapelo Island Research Foundation in 1949. He later funded the research of Eugene Odum, whose 1958 paper &quot;The Ecology of a Salt Marsh&quot; won wide acclaim in scientific circles. Odum&#x27;s paper helped show the fragility of the cycle of nature in the wetlands.

Reynolds&#x27; Sapelo Research Foundation also helped fund the University of Georgia&#x27;s research on the island. Reynolds&#x27; widow, Annemarie Reynolds, sold Sapelo to the state of Georgia for $1 million, a fraction of its worth, in two separate transactions in 1969 and 1976. The latter sale resulted in the creation of the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, a state-federal partnership between the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In part to the philanthropy of the Reynolds family, Sapelo is now open to the public by appointment.

=== Geologic history ===
Sapelo Island is located within the Georgia Bight, a tidally influenced coastline that experiences two tidal cycles each day. Average difference between low and high tides at Sapelo Island is ~. Consequently, Sapelo island is an example of a tidally influenced barrier island system. Over the last 2.5 million years (Neogene and Quaternary Periods), sea-level fall occurred in response to growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice cap. The resulting regression generated shoreline complexes that preceded the modern Holocene shoreline, with the most recent known as the late Pleistocene Silver Bluff Formation. The Silver Bluff deposits underlie Holocene Sapelo Island sediments, and they are visible along the southwestern bank of Blackbeard Creek as the Raccoon Bluff. During the last glacial maximum (LGM) approximately 18,000 years ago (latest Pleistocene), maximum regression forced the Sapelo Island shoreline eastward approximately from its present-day location. During the subsequent transgression, a Holocene shoreline formed the present Sapelo Island shoreline complex, including Cabretta and Nannygoat beaches.

===Hurricane Irma===
In 2017, storm surge from Hurricane Irma caused a tidal inlet to breach the southern end of Blackbeard Island, and it created a small island between Sapelo Island and Blackbeard Island.

==Climate==
==Tourism==
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) offers tours several days a week. These can be booked through the Sapelo Island Visitors Center. Additionally, many island residents offer private tours, which can often be customized to fit the interests of individual tourists. A state campground is also available to groups of 15 to 25 people on Cabretta Island, adjacent to Sapelo Island.

==In popular culture==
Sapelo Island resident and descendant of Bilali Muhammed, Cornelia Walker Bailey, wrote the book &quot;God, Dr. Buzzard, and the Bolito Man: A saltwater Geechee talk about life on Sapelo Island, Georgia&quot;, which is a first-person account of growing up on Sapelo; co-author Christena Bledsoe.

R. J. Reynolds&#x27; grandson Patrick Reynolds and author Tom Shachtman co-authored &quot;The Gilded Leaf: Triumph, tragedy, and tobacco – three generations of the R. J. Reynolds fortune and family&quot;, which offers an unvarnished view of R. J. Reynolds, Jr. during the time he owned Sapelo.

Author Tom Poland wrote a novel titled &quot;Forbidden Island ... an Island Called Sapelo&quot;.

Singer Larry Jon Wilson has recorded a song titled &quot;Sapelo&quot;, which is about the island on the album &quot;Testifying: The Country Soul Revue&quot;.

Author and island resident Michele Nicole Johnson published the photograph book &quot;Sapelo Island&#x27;s Hog Hammock&quot; in 2009.

Author T. C. Boyle set his 1990 novel &quot;East Is East&quot; on a fictional island in Georgia, much of which resembles Sapelo Island, such as the presence of Hog Hammock and proximity to Darien.

An episode of Season 6 of the show &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; featured the termite research program at the University of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island.

The Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) hosts a Podcast titled ‘Sapelo NERRds’ about the research being conducted on the island and across Coastal Georgia.

An episode of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; was filmed on Sapelo Island and the Hog Hammock community in 2013, documenting the childhood of Allen Bailey and telling the community&#x27;s story and current property tax issues.

The podcast &quot;Uncivil&quot; was mostly based on the experience of local Gullah people struggling to keep their land and culture intact despite many legal struggles. &quot;A 19th century promise, and a 21st century betrayal. The past and present of 40 acres and a mule.&quot;

&quot;PBS America Reframed&quot; has an episode on Sapelo. About 90 minutes, it includes extensive footage of interviews of Cornelia Walker Bailey and her family.

Ronda Rich has written an adventure novel set on the island, &quot;Sapelo Island&quot;. It is &quot;a Stella Bankwell mystery&quot;.

<doc id="1298056" wikidata="Q1771239" url="?curid=1298056" title="Robert Trent Jones">
<text>Robert Trent Jones Sr. (June 20, 1906 – June 14, 2000) was a British–American golf course architect who designed or re-designed more than 500 golf courses in 45 U.S. states and 35 countries. In reference to this, Jones took pride in saying, &quot;The sun never sets on a Robert Trent Jones golf course.&quot; He is often confused with the famous amateur golfer Bobby Jones with whom he worked from time to time. Jones received the 1987 Old Tom Morris Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, GCSAA&#x27;s highest honor. Also in 1987, he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Trent Jones was born on June 20, 1906, in Ince-in-Makerfield, England, to Welsh parents. At age five or six, Jones emigrated with his parents to the United States, where they arrived in East Rochester, New York. Jones worked as a caddie at The Country Club of Rochester and accepted a job as golf professional at Sodus Bay Heights Golf Club in nearby Sodus Point, New York. He met Donald Ross as a youth and, taking up the game, recorded the best score of all the amateur golfers at the 1927 Canadian Open and set a course record at Rochester.

While working as a golf professional, Jones attended Cornell University, undergoing a customized course of study that would allow him to pursue his interest in golf course design, during which time he designed nine holes of the university&#x27;s golf course, now known as the Robert Trent Jones Golf Course at Cornell University (he designed the other nine holes in 1954). While at Cornell, Jones joined Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) Fraternity.

Jones was married to Ione Jones, who died in 1987 and with whom he had two sons: Robert Jr. and Rees, both of whom became golf course architects.

== Career ==
Jones went into business with Canadian architect Stanley Thompson after concluding his studies at Cornell, and with him designed courses in Canada. Following his partnership with Thompson, Jones went into business on his own and began designing local courses in the United States in the 1930s. Many of these, such as the 1936 course at Green Lakes State Park (see photo), were built using labor provided by the Works Progress Administration.

Shortly after World War II, Jones got his first major assignment designing the Peachtree Golf Club in Atlanta in collaboration with golf legend Bobby Jones. At Bobby Jones&#x27; request, Jones redesigned the 11th and 16th holes at Augusta National Golf Club. Despite the similarity of their names, the two men were not related. To make this distinction clear, Robert began using the middle name &quot;Trent&quot; shortly afterward.

In 1955, Gene Hamm helped Jones build the Duke University Golf Course in Durham, North Carolina. He moved from there to Delaware to continue work with Jones, and then in 1959 moved back to Raleigh where he began his own design career. During the 1950s, Jones&#x27; annual income was reported as being $600,000—according to &quot;Golf Digest&quot;, no one other than Ben Hogan earned more money from golf at that time.

Jones&#x27; clients included U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, for a putting green at the White House and a single hole at Camp David, as well as the Rockefeller family, Aga Khan and Hassan II of Morocco, for private courses. He was commissioned in 1990 to design a set of 18 courses in Alabama, the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, the largest single golf design contract in history.

In 1979, the Northern California Golf Association selected Robert Trent Jones Jr., son Jones Sr., to design the Poppy Hills Golf Course situated in Pebble Beach, California. Jones Sr. had previously crafted the Spyglass Hill Golf Course in Pebble Beach, and during this project, he received valuable assistance from his son. Their combined expertise has led them to design of over 400 golf courses worldwide.

== Death ==
Jones continued to design golf courses in his later years until health problems prompted him to retire to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where he died on June 14, 2000, at age 93. His final course, the Southern Highlands Golf Club, was completed in 1999.

<doc id="1298084" wikidata="Q3437832" url="?curid=1298084" title="Rock music in Spain">
<text>Spanish rock is the term used for the variety of rock music produced in Spain. Most bands formed in Spain have sung in Spanish, but many others have sung in English, French and Italian, in addition to the other languages spoken in Spain, such as Catalan, Galician, Basque, Aragonese, and Asturian.

==History==
===Beginnings (1950s–early 1960s)===
At first, rock music was influenced by the surrounding countries like France or Italy. Despite Francoist censorship, many albums were released and mass media started to introduce the new sounds of international music. The most important rock scenes were in Madrid, Zaragoza, Sevilla, Cádiz, Barcelona, and Valencia.

===Beat, pop, psychedelia (1960s)===
Rock in Spain started to spread nationally. After the British Invasion, many artists such as Los Bravos, , Los Brincos and Miguel Ríos appeared. Los Brincos achieved some international success in France, Portugal and Italy. Los Bravos hit some international charts with their single &quot;Black Is Black&quot;, as did Mike Ríos with &quot;A Song of Joy&quot;.

===Progressive and hard rock (1970s)===

While mainstream Spanish rock declined during this decade, the underground scenes of progressive rock and rock urbano emerged. Spanish progressive rock was a commercial failure. In the mid-1970s, a new style called Andalusian rock that combined flamenco with prog rock started to gain some popularity with bands like Triana. During the Spanish transition to democracy in the late 1970s, hard rock acts appeared. Some hard rock bands influenced by early punk rock like Leño pioneered the rock urbano movement.

===Golden Era. New wave, post-punk, heavy metal and punk (1980s)===
Punk rock in Spain started its most successful stage with bands like Kortatu, La Polla Records and Eskorbuto. La Movida Madrileña was a countercultural movement that produced many bands influenced by punk and new wave, such as kaka de luxe, Derribos Arias, Radio Futura, Alaska y Dinarama, Gabinete Caligari, Nacha Pop, Loquillo y los Trogloditas and Los Secretos. Since many of the bands from La Movida did not achieve enough commercial success, many discographies left them supporting other bands like Mecano, which achieved some international success, Siniestro Total, or Aerolíneas Federales. Hard rock acts such as Los Suaves or Barricada emerged with lack of promotion. Heavy metal bands also appeared in the early 1980s like Barón Rojo and Obús.
Also of note is a Galician combo named Golpes Bajos part of a movement similar to the La Movida Madrileña but here since it was from Galicia (Spain) it was named Movida viguesa after the town of Vigo.

===Indie and alternative (1990s–present)===

The band Héroes del Silencio achieved international success, hitting some charts in Europe and Latin America. Los Rodríguez also became popular in Spain and Latin America. In the mid-1990s, some cult bands like Los Enemigos, Extremoduro and Platero y Tú started to achieve mainstream success. Indie rock bands like Los Planetas appeared. Ska-punk band Ska-P and folk metal band Mägo de Oz emerged, showing the rise of rock diversification.

<doc id="1298086" wikidata="Q1605373" url="?curid=1298086" title="Hennepin Avenue Bridge">
<text>The Hennepin Avenue Bridge is the structure that carries Hennepin County State Aid Highway 52, Hennepin Avenue, across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at Nicollet Island. Officially, it is the Father Louis Hennepin Bridge, in honor of the 17th-century explorer Louis Hennepin, the first European to see the Saint Anthony Falls. It is the fourth bridge on the site, having been preceded by the first bridge to cross the Mississippi and two other overpasses.

==History==
===Background===
The bridge crosses from the west bank of the Mississippi River to Nicollet Island. Another smaller bridge crosses from the island to the east bank. Three previous bridges had been on the location, two of which were suspension bridges, while a third—which existed nearly a century—was composed of steel arch spans. The original crossing, which opened as a toll bridge on January 23, 1855, was the first permanent span across the Mississippi. Other bridges were completed in 1876 and 1888.

While the previous century-old bridge was aging, there was opposition to the plans for the new bridge. A $28.6 million price tag , about three times more than a similar close by bridge, as well as a seen-as-unnecessary suspension design given the relatively short 625-foot length. Hennepin County defended the decisions, saying they wanted a &quot;landmark&quot; bridge at the site; comparisons were made to the Minneapolis suspension bridges of the past, as well as the Brooklyn Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge. Additionally, federal funding requested by Martin Sabo had been contingent on the construction of a suspension bridge.

===Design===
The bridge was designed by Howard, Needles, Tammen &amp; Bergerndoff. The bridge could have been shorter, but twenty feet were added to the towers to avoid a squat look. The suspension design was unnecessary from an engineering perspective but hailed as being &quot;elegant,&quot; while also having a &quot;Mussolini kind of quality&quot;. Two 150-foot-tall towers hold up the two 1,037-foot spans. Stairs and a ramp on the eastern bank connect pedestrians to West River Parkway below.

===Construction===

Some 900 tons of steel cable, more than 5,900 feet, were ordered from Bethlehem Steel Corp in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Johnson Bros. Corp. of Litchfield, Minnesota did the work on the suspension cables.

During construction, foundations of the 1855 bridge and 1870 bridge were uncovered and documented by the Minnesota Historical Society.

On July 31, 1989, a fire underneath the bridge blamed on vagrants caused an estimated $80,000 in damage to construction equipment. The fire was underneath a yet-undemolished part of the old bridge and did not damage the new construction. One lane of the new bridge was opened in August 1989.

In June 1990, a month before the schedule completion of the bridge, Hennepin County spent $16,550 to perform additional stress tests on the bridge, not wanting a repeat of the Golden Gate Bridge 50th anniversary celebrations where unexpectedly large crowds caused the deck of the bridge to significantly sag. Officials banned traffic-closing events and large crowds from the bridge in December 1990, finding that large crowds combined with dancing could cause unacceptable levels of stress.

All lanes of traffic on the bridge were opened for traffic on August 23, 1990. Originally budgeted at $25 million, the bridge was completed for $28.6 million. While locally known as the Hennepin Avenue Bridge, it is officially the Father Louis Hennepin Bridge after the explorer who was one of the first Europeans in the area, and whom Hennepin County was named after.

=== Renovation ===
In 2023, Howard, Needles, Tammen &amp; Bergerndoff (the original builders of the bridge) were selected by Hennepin County to help improve the safety and service life of the bridge, as well as modify the bridge deck to facilitate easier public transit, bicycle and pedestrian use.

== Archeological site ==
Each of the three previous bridges had historic value to the City of Minneapolis. Excavations in 1983, 1985, and 1987, and construction work during the building of the current bridge in 1988 and 1989, found substantial portions of the first and second bridges. Foundations of the first bridge, tunnels used for the construction of both, and various anchors and other elements of each bridge were discovered. The archeological site was included as an official part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District. Various pilings and artifacts exist at First Bridge Park next to the bridge.

==In popular media==
The bridge appears in the 1992 film &quot;Crossing the Bridge&quot;. The bridge depicts a fictional border crossing between the United States and Canada in Detroit, Michigan. A review panned the lack of continuity between the far shots showing a real bridge near Detroit and the close-ups of the very different Hennepin Avenue Bridge.

<text>Marble Canyon is the section of the Colorado River canyon in northern Arizona from Lee&#x27;s Ferry to the confluence with the Little Colorado River, which marks the beginning of the Grand Canyon.

Lee&#x27;s Ferry is a common launching point for river runners starting their journey through Marble Canyon and then onward to the Grand Canyon. Marble Canyon is also well known for the Navajo Bridge, where US Highway 89A crosses the Colorado River.

Marble Canyon marks the western boundary of the Navajo Nation. In 1975, the former Marble Canyon National Monument, which followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lee&#x27;s Ferry, was made part of Grand Canyon National Park.
The name Marble Canyon is a misnomer because there is no marble there. Although John Wesley Powell knew this when he named the canyon, he thought the polished limestone looked like marble. In his words, &quot;The limestone of the canyon is often polished, and makes a beautiful marble. Sometimes the rocks are of many colors – white, gray, pink, and purple, with saffron tints.&quot;

Marble Canyon is the site of one of the last great proposed dam projects on the Colorado, the Marble Canyon Dam. Proposed and investigated in the early 1950s by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, the proposal met substantial opposition, notably from the Sierra Club, when a revived proposal was considered by the state of Arizona as part of the Central Arizona Project from 1965 to 1968. The proposed dam was finally abandoned in 1968. Exploratory holes, which were drilled in the Redwall Limestone of the canyon walls in an early phase of the abortive project, can still be seen at Mile 39.2.


==Geology==
The uppermost walls of Marble Canyon are composed of Kaibab Limestone upon the Toroweap Formation upon Coconino Sandstone.

==Ecology==
Marble Canyon is the only home of the endangered cactus &quot;Pediocactus bradyi&quot;. The critically endangered California Condor occurs in Marble Canyon.

<doc id="1298090" wikidata="Q2454712" url="?curid=1298090" title="Country House (song)">
<text>&quot;Country House&quot; is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1995), on 14 August 1995 by Food Records and Parlophone. Released on the same day as the Oasis single &quot;Roll with It&quot; – in a chart battle dubbed the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot; – &quot;Country House&quot; reached number one in the UK Singles Chart (the first of two Blur singles to reach number one, the second being 1997&#x27;s &quot;Beetlebum&quot;). The song is the band&#x27;s best-selling single, with over 540,000 copies sold as of May 2014. Its music video was directed by Damien Hirst and nominated for Best Video in the 1996 BRIT Awards.

==Background and writing==
In an interview for the &quot;South Bank Show&quot;, Damon Albarn explained that it was inspired by former Blur manager Dave Balfe, who left Blur&#x27;s label Food Records and bought a house in the country. Balfe moved to &quot;The Bury&quot; in 1994 at Church End, Barton-le-Clay in southern Bedfordshire off the A6. The house had four acres of land, nine bedrooms with five en-suite. He moved with his wife Helen and their children aged 2 and 4, when he was 36. The house was advertised in 2015 for £2m. It was Grade 2 listed in February 1975.

==Content==
The song is about a man who retires to an expensive country house to escape the pressures of the city. The cover art features a horizontally-flipped image of Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria.

==Release and &quot;battle&quot; with Oasis==
&quot;Country House&quot; received a great deal of media attention when Blur&#x27;s label Food Records moved the original release date to the same day as Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Roll with It&quot;. The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands and this clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot, dubbed the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;. In the end, &quot;Country House&quot; won the &quot;battle&quot;, attaining the No. 1 spot while &quot;Roll with It&quot; came in at No. 2. Albarn himself was surprised that &quot;Country House&quot; topped the charts. He told &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;I sort of believed all the papers, including &quot;NME&quot;, who told me Oasis were going to win.&quot;

==Critical reception==
David Stubbs from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; felt the song &quot;sounds at first to be taunting us with that old Britpop standard, um, thingummy, the one that goes &quot;Our house is a very, very, very nice house/With two cats in the yard..&quot; but turns out to be a cynical account of the miserable fat-rat city achiever attempting to find solace in the big rural pile of his dreams — a seemingly chirpy but ultimately very unsettling vignette hinting at Blur&#x27;s darker edges.&quot; Mark Sutherland from &quot;NME&quot; named it Single of the Week, writing, &quot;Yup, Blur&#x27;s first new material since the epoch-shaping &quot;Parklife&quot; LP is nothing short of a classic pop single. In the space of the time-honoured three-and-a-bit minutes, it manages to recall everyone from Madness to The Beatles to, um, Chas and Dave, craft the most infectious chorus of modern times and still squeeze in the astonishing line &quot;He&#x27;s reading Balzac, knocking back Prozac&quot; before tea-time. And you can&#x27;t really ask for much more than that.&quot; Another &quot;NME&quot; editor, Johnny Cigarettes, described it as &quot;feisty, upbeat singalong pop&quot;. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave &quot;Country House&quot; five out of five, praising it as &quot;a classic pop tune.&quot;

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Country House&quot; was directed by English artist and art collector Damien Hirst, who had attended Goldsmiths, University of London, with members of Blur. It features the band and a businessman (played by Keith Allen) in a flat with the band playing a board game called &quot;Escape from the Rat Race&quot; before they become trapped in the game where they are with farm animals and other people before appearing in the flat again. The band appears in the video alongside British comic actor Matt Lucas and models Sara Stockbridge, Jo Guest and Vanessa Upton. It features pastiches of—or tributes to—Benny Hill (Lucas&#x27; doctor chasing scantily clad young women culminating in the entry of the milk van of Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)) and Queen&#x27;s 1975 video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. It was nominated for Best Video in the 1996 BRIT Awards.

The external shots of the video are at Pyrton Manor, Pyrton, in east Oxfordshire, west of junction 6 of the M40, near the B4009 and Watlington. It is now home of Vogue writer Laura Bailey, and is the former home of the 1956 High Sheriff of Oxfordshire. It is Elizabethan, built around the start of the 17th century.

<text>Gérard Anaclet Vincent Encausse (13 July 1865 – 25 October 1916), whose esoteric pseudonyms were Papus and Tau Vincent, was a French physician, hypnotist, and popularizer of occultism, who founded the modern Martinist Order.

== Early life ==

Gerard Encausse was born in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain on 13 July 1865 of a Spanish mother and a French father, Louis Encausse, a chemist. His family moved to Paris when he was four years old, and he received his education there.

As a young man, Encausse spent a great deal of time at the Bibliothèque Nationale studying the Kabbalah, occult tarot, magic and alchemy, and the writings of Eliphas Lévi. He joined the French Theosophical Society shortly after it was founded by Madame Blavatsky in 1884–1885, but he resigned soon after joining because he disliked the Society&#x27;s emphasis on Eastern occultism.

==Career==

===Overview===
In 1888, he co-founded his own group, the Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix. That same year, he and his friend Lucien Chamuel founded the &quot;Librarie du Merveilleux&quot; and its monthly revue &quot;L&#x27;Initiation&quot;, which remained in publication until 1914.

Encausse was also a member of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn temple in Paris, as well as Memphis-Misraim and probably other esoteric or paramasonic organizations, as well as being an author of several occult books. Outside of his paramasonic and Martinist activities he was also a spiritual student of the French spiritualist healer, Anthelme Nizier Philippe, &quot;Maître Philippe de Lyon&quot;.

Despite his heavy involvement in occultism and occultist groups, Encausse managed to find time to pursue more conventional academic studies at the University of Paris. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1894 upon submitting a dissertation on Philosophical Anatomy. He opened a clinic in the rue Rodin which was quite successful.

Encausse visited Russia three times, in 1901, 1905, and 1906, serving Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra both as physician and occult consultant. It has been incorrectly claimed that in October 1905, he conjured up the spirit of Alexander III (father of Tsar Nicholas), who prophesied that the Tsar would meet his downfall at the hands of revolutionaries. Encausse&#x27;s followers allege that he informed the Tsar that he would be able to magically avert Alexander&#x27;s prophesy so long as Encausse was alive. Nicholas kept his hold on the throne of Russia until 141 days after Papus&#x27; death.

Although Encausse seems to have served the Tsar and Tsarina in what was essentially the capacity of a mediumistic spiritual advisor, he was later curiously concerned about their heavy reliance on occultism to assist them in deciding questions of government. During their later correspondence, he warned them a number of times against the influence of Rasputin.

===Involvement and influences===
====Lévi, Tarot, and the Kabbalah====

Encausse&#x27;s early readings in tarot and the lore of the Kabbalah in translation was inspired by the occult writings of Éliphas Lévi, whose translation of the &quot;Nuctemeron&quot; of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; printed as a supplement to &quot;Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie&quot; (1855), provided Encausse with his pen name. &quot;Papus&quot; is the name of a Genius of the First Hour in the &quot;Nuctemeron&quot;, and is translated in the text as &quot;physician.&quot;

====1888 Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix====

Although Encausse claimed as his &quot;spiritual master&quot; the mysterious magician and healer known as &quot;le Maitre Philippe&quot; (Philippe Nizier), his first actual teacher in the intellectual aspects of occultism was the marquis Joseph Alexandre Saint-Yves d&#x27;Alveydre (1842 - 1910). Saint-Yves had inherited the papers of one of the great founders of French occultism, Antoine Fabre d&#x27;Olivet (1762 - 1825), and it was probably Saint-Yves who introduced Papus to the marquis Stanislas de Guaita (1861 - 1897).

In 1888, Encausse and de Guaita joined with Joséphin Péladan and Oswald Wirth to found the Rosicrucian &quot;Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Cross&quot;.

====1891 l&#x27;Ordre Martiniste====

In 1891, Encausse claimed to have come into the possession of the original papers of Martinez Paschalis, or de Pasqually (c. 1700-1774), and therewith founded an Order of Martinists called l&#x27;Ordre des Supérieurs Inconnus. He claimed to have been given authority in the Rite of Saint-Martin by his friend Henri Vicomte de Laage, who claimed that his maternal grandfather had been initiated into the order by Saint-Martin himself, and who had attempted to revive the order in 1887. The Martinist Order was to become a primary focus for Encausse, and continues today as one of his most enduring legacies.

====1893-1895 Bishop of l&#x27;Église Gnostique de France====

In 1893, Encausse was consecrated a bishop of l&#x27;Église Gnostique de France by Jules Doinel, who had founded this Church as an attempt to revive the Cathar religion in 1890. In 1895, Doinel abdicated as Primate of the French Gnostic Church, leaving control of the Church to a synod of three of his former bishops, one of whom was Encausse.

====1895 Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn====

In March 1895, Encausse joined the Ahathoor Temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in Paris.

====1901 Anti-Semitic writings====

In October 1901 Encausse collaborated with Jean Carrère in producing a series of articles in the &quot;Écho de Paris&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Niet&quot; (&quot;no&quot; in Russian). In the articles Sergei Witte and Pyotr Rachkovsky were attacked, and it was suggested that there was a sinister financial syndicate trying to disrupt the Franco-Russian alliance. Encausse and Carrère predicted that this syndicate was a Jewish conspiracy, and the anti-Semitic nature of these articles, compounded by Encausse&#x27;s known connection to the Tsar of Russia, may have contributed to the allegation that Papus was the author who forged The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

====1908 - 1913 Encausse, Reuss and paramasonry====

Encausse never became a regular Freemason. Despite this, he organized what was announced as an &quot;International Masonic Conference&quot; in Paris on 24 June 1908, and at this conference he first met Theodor Reuss, and the two men apparently exchanged patents:

Reuss elevated Encausse as X° of Ordo Templi Orientis as well as giving him license to establish a &quot;Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Ancient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris.&quot; For his part, Encausse assisted Reuss in the formation of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica as a child of l&#x27;Église Gnostique de France, thus forming the E.G.C. within the tradition of French neo-gnosticism.

When John Yarker died in 1913, Encausse was elected as his successor to the office of Grand Hierophant (international head) of the Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis and Mizraim.

==Death==
When World War I broke out, Encausse joined the French army medical corps. While working in a military hospital, he contracted tuberculosis and died in Paris on 25 October 1916, at the age of 51.

<doc id="1298105" wikidata="Q5323374" url="?curid=1298105" title="EMC E2">
<text>The EMC E2 was an American passenger-train diesel locomotive which as a single unit developed , from two (2) prime movers. These locomotives were typically operated as a unit set (A - B - B) or (A - B - A); where the three unit lashup developed 5400 horsepower. This was almost the ideal horsepower required () for the tonnage of a 15 - 18 car passenger train, operated over the ruling grades of virtually all of the mileage between major American cities. The units were of the A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC), later Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) of La Grange, Illinois.

Two sets (each of three units, A-B-B) () were produced in 1937 for named passenger trains; the first set (SF-1, SF-2, and SF-3) for the &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. These motive-power sets were jointly owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad, the Chicago and North Western Railway, and the Southern Pacific Railroad. The second A-B-B set (LA-1, LA-2, and LA-3) was used for the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;; and, was jointly owned and operated by the UP and CNW only. The first locomotive power unit was the control cab, or &quot;A&quot; unit, while the other two were cabless boosters, or &quot;B&quot; units. The control cab and booster units were designed for multiple unit operation (the first in diesel motive power). A single engine crew in the cab, remotely monitored and controlled all three motive power units from a single control station in the cab. The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two 900 hp Winton 201-A engines each, with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors. In addition the locomotives contained steam generators for passenger car heating. An independent auxiliary diesel powered electric generator was housed in the first car of the train consist. This car was a combination power/baggage/post office, or crew dormitory. This car provided electric power for train-line &quot;hotel&quot; power for their named train set(s), to include the air conditioning, dining, lounge, and entertainment. The power cars were required for these train sets because of the electrical demand of their feature cars. The E2 was the third model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.

The E2, along with the more-or-less simultaneous EA/EB units for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the E1 units for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, represented an important step in the evolution of the passenger diesel locomotive. While the EA, E1 and E2 were each built for a specific railroad and train, they were largely identical mechanically and were a step further away from the concept of custom-built motive power, integrated into a particular streamliner; and towards mass-produced standardized locomotives. This transition was achieved with the E3, E4, E5, and E6, EMC (later EMD)&#x27;s next models.

== Styling ==
The E2&#x27;s profile was more aggressive than the sloping snouts of previous EMC passenger power, so they gained a &quot;bulldog nose&quot; nickname. Subsequent blunt-snouted passenger units are sometimes also called this, but the E2&#x27;s nose is by far the most bulbous among the E and F series locomotives. The seven porthole windows on the sides were one less than its predecessors in Union Pacific&#x27;s diesel streamliner fleet, the M-10003 to M-10006. One of the nicknames that these locomotives acquired, because of these portholes and prominent nose, was &quot;Queen Mary,&quot; after the British Cunard liner had recently been put in service. The Union Pacific Railroad also referred to the schedule of the &quot;City of San Francisco,&quot; a passenger train hauled by these locomotives, as sailings. Later E units for Union Pacific, including E7 locomotives, were ordered modified with extra porthole style windows. The units were painted in Union Pacific&#x27;s Armour Yellow with Leaf Brown roofs and undersides, the same colors as UP&#x27;s previous streamliners (the M-10000 etc.). Color photographs indicate that UP modified their color scheme with slate gray roofs around mid-1941. There was extensive stainless steel on the noses, upon which were displayed the owning railroads&#x27; heralds in color. The bulbous nose and stainless steel ornamentation of the E2 evoked the nose design of the UP&#x27;s M-10003 to M-10006 streamliner locomotives, which were also bulbous, featuring a large stainless steel grille and pilot ornamentation. UP&#x27;s advertising from that era often had renditions of their locomotives emphasizing their bulbous and shiny noses.

== Replacement ==
All four &quot;B&quot; units (SF-2, SF-3, LA-2, LA-3) went to the Union Pacific; they were used until 1953, when they were &quot;rebuilt&quot; into E8 locomotives. These rebuilds utilised little of the previous locomotives and were effectively trade-ins. The driving &quot;A&quot; unit of the SF set, SF-1, (the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;) went to the Southern Pacific; it was likewise &quot;rebuilt&quot; into EMD E7 #6017. The &quot;A&quot; unit of the LA set, LA-1, went to the Chicago and North Western (#5003A) and was scrapped in 1953 after it was destroyed in a head-on collision near Rhinelander, Wisconsin.

No E2 survives today. However the pair of Winton Model 201A V12 diesel engines from SF-1 (the lead unit of the City of San Francisco set, nicknamed &quot;Queen Mary&quot;) were rescued from scrap and eventually became part of the collection of artifacts at the California State Railroad Museum at Sacramento. One of the engines has now (September 2009) been transferred to the Illinois Railway Museum at Union, Illinois.

<doc id="1298107" wikidata="Q941966" url="?curid=1298107" title="R. C. Sherriff">
<text>Robert Cedric Sherriff, FSA, FRSL (6 June 1896 – 13 November 1975) was an English writer best known for his play &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, which was based on his experiences as an army officer in the First World War. He wrote several plays, many novels, and multiple screenplays, and was nominated for an Academy Award and two BAFTA awards.

==Early life==
Sherriff was born in Hampton Wick, Middlesex, to insurance clerk Herbert Hankin Sherriff and Constance Winder. He was educated at Kingston Grammar School in Kingston upon Thames from 1905 to 1913. After he left school, Sherriff began working at an insurance office as a clerk in 1914.

==Military service==
Sherriff served as an officer in the 9th battalion of the East Surrey Regiment in the First World War, taking part in the fighting at Vimy Ridge and Loos. He was severely wounded at Passchendaele near Ypres in 1917.

==Post-war period==
After recovering from his wounds, Sherriff worked as an insurance adjuster from 1918 to 1928 at Sun Insurance Company, London. 

Sherriff read history at New College, Oxford, from 1931 to 1934. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the Society of Antiquaries of London.

==Career==

===Playwright===
Sherriff wrote his first play to help Kingston Rowing Club raise money to buy a new boat. Sherriff started writing his seventh play, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, probably his most famous, during the summer of 1927 in one of the railway carriage bungalows at Selsey. It was published in 1929 and was based on his experiences in the war. It was given a single Sunday performance, on 9 December 1928, by the Incorporated Stage Society at the Apollo Theatre, directed by James Whale and with the 21-year-old Laurence Olivier in the lead role. In the audience was Maurice Browne who produced it at the Savoy Theatre where it was performed for two years from 1929. The play was hugely successful and there was wide press coverage which reveals how audience responses provoked by this play shaped understanding of the First World War in the interwar years.

===Novelist===
Sherriff also wrote prose. A novelised version of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, co-written with Vernon Bartlett, was published in 1930. His 1939 novel, &quot;The Hopkins Manuscript&quot; is an H. G. Wells-influenced post-apocalyptic story about an earth devastated because of a collision with the Moon. Its sober language and realistic depiction of an average man coming to terms with a ruined England is said to have been an influence on later science fiction authors such as John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss. &quot;The Fortnight in September&quot;, an earlier novel, published in 1931, is a rather more plausible story about a Bognor holiday enjoyed by a lower-middle-class family from Dulwich. It was nominated by Kazuo Ishiguro as a book to &#x27;inspire, uplift and offer escape&#x27; in a list compiled by &quot;The Guardian&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic, describing it as &quot;just about the most uplifting, life-affirming novel I can think of right now&quot;.

His 1936 novel &quot;Greengates&quot; is a realistic novel about a middle-aged couple, Tom and Edith Baldwin, moving from an established London suburb into the new suburbs of Metro-land.

==Award nominations==
Sherriff was nominated along with Eric Maschwitz and Claudine West for an Academy award for writing an adapted screenplay for &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; which was released in 1939. His 1955 screenplays, &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; and &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot; were nominated for best British screenplay BAFTA awards.

<text>PetroChina Company Limited () is a Chinese oil and gas company and is the listed arm of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), headquartered in Dongcheng District, Beijing. The company is currently Asia&#x27;s largest oil and gas producer. Traded in Hong Kong and New York, the mainland enterprise announced its plans to issue stock in Shanghai in November 2007, and subsequently entered the constituent of SSE 50 Index. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, PetroChina was ranked as the 32nd-largest public company in the world.

== History ==
PetroChina was established as a joint stock company with limited liabilities under the Company Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (the PRC) on 5 November 1999, as part of the restructuring of CNPC. In the restructuring, CNPC injected into PetroChina most of the assets and liabilities of CNPC relating to its exploration and production, refining and marketing, chemicals and natural gas businesses.
Because of Sinopec&#x27;s link to Sudan through parent company China Petrochemical Corporation, several institutional investors such as Harvard and Yale decided, in 2005, to divest from Sinopec. Sudan divestment efforts have continued to be concentrated on PetroChina since then. Fidelity Investments, after pressure from activist groups, also announced in a filing in the US that it had sold 91 per cent of its American Depositary Receipts in PetroChina in the first quarter of 2007.

At the beginning of May 2007, the company announced it had made China&#x27;s largest oil find in a decade off the country&#x27;s northeast coast, in an oilfield named Jidong Nanpu oil field in Bohai Bay. In May 2008 these expectations were lowered.

On 7 November 2007, Hang Seng Indexes Company announced that PetroChina would be a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock, effective 10 December 2007. PetroChina also came under scrutiny from international organizations for its part in trading with the Sudanese government as it undertook the war in Darfur.

On 19 August 2009, PetroChina signed an A$50 billion deal with ExxonMobil to purchase liquefied natural gas from the Gorgon field in Western Australia, considered the largest contract ever signed between China and Australia, which ensures China a steady supply of LNG fuel for 20 years, and also forms as China&#x27;s largest supply of relatively &quot;clean energy&quot;. This deal has been formally secured, despite relations between Australia and China being at their lowest point in years, following the Rio Tinto espionage case and the granting of visas to Rebiya Kadeer to visit Australia.

PetroChina&#x27;s Dushanzi District refinery became fully operational on 24 September 2009. The refinery is China&#x27;s largest refinery with annual capacity of 10 million tons of oil and 1 million tons of ethylene. The refinery is an integral part of China&#x27;s ambitions to import oil from Kazakhstan.

In February 2011, PetroChina agreed to pay $5.4 billion for a 49% stake in Canada&#x27;s Duvernay shale assets owned by Encana. It was China&#x27;s biggest investment in shale gas to date. PetroChina&#x27;s subsidiary in Canada is named PetroChina Canada and has an office in Calgary. It operates under the direction of Li Zhiming.

China signed a deal in 2016 with the Nepal Oil Corporation to sell 30% of the total Nepalese petroleum consumption. China plans to build a pipeline to Nepal&#x27;s Panchkhal along with a storage depot.

In 2017, the shares of PetroChina upped after the rise of natural gas prices for commercial use.

In February 2019, as part of the Arrow Energy joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell, the company was granted leases for $10 billion (AUS) towards the Surat project in Queensland, Australia. Liaoyang Petrochemical Corp, a unit of PetroChina, in May 2019 exported to Europe for the first time. PetroChina posted a US$4 billion profit for 2019. In 2023, PetroChina received the equivalent of US$343 million in state subsidies.

PetroChina was allowed to accelerate its renewable energy business in 2022, installing 5.36 gigawatts of wind and solar power plants and 11.2 million square meters of geothermal projects during the first half of the year. This came after the company posted a 55.3 percent year-on-year increase in interim earnings.

==PetroChina Pipelines==
PetroChina Pipelines is a subsidiary (72.26%) of PetroChina that managed the first three pipelines of the project.

===West–East Gas Pipeline I===

====History====
The construction of the West–East Gas Pipeline started in 2002. The pipeline was put into trial operation on 1 October 2004, and the full commercial supply of natural gas commenced on 1 January 2005. The pipeline is owned and operated by PetroChina West–East Gas Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina. Originally, it was agreed that PetroChina would have owned 50% of the pipeline, while Royal Dutch Shell, Gazprom, and ExxonMobil had been slated to hold 15% each, and Sinopec 5%. However, in August 2004, the Board of Directors of PetroChina announced that following good faith discussions with all parties to the Joint Venture Framework Agreement, the parties had not been able to reach an agreement, and the joint venture framework agreement was terminated.

====Technical features====
The long pipeline runs from Lunnan in Xinjiang to Shanghai. The pipeline passes through 66 cities in the 10 provinces in China. Natural gas transported by the pipeline is used for electricity production in the Yangtze River Delta area.
The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas annually. The cost of the pipeline was US$5.7 billion. By the end of 2007, the capacity was planned to be upgraded to . For this purpose, ten new gas compressor stations will be built and eight existing stations are to be upgraded.

====Connections====
The West–East Gas Pipeline is connected to the Shaan-Jing pipeline by three branch pipelines. The long Ji-Ning branch between the Qingshan Distributing Station and the Anping Distributing Station became operational on 30 December 2005.

====Source of supply====
The pipeline is supplied from the Tarim Basin oil and gas fields in Xinjiang province. The Changqing gas area in Shaanxi province is a secondary gas source. In the future, the planned Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline will be connected to the West–East Gas Pipeline.

Starting from 15 September 2009, the pipeline is also supplied with coalbed methane from the Qinshui Basin in Shanxi.

===West–East Gas Pipeline II===

Construction of the second West–East Gas Pipeline started on 22 February 2008. The pipeline with a total length of , including of the main line and eight sub-lines, will run from Khorgas in northwestern Xinjiang to Guangzhou in Guangdong. Up to Gansu, it will be parallel and interconnected with the first west–east pipeline. The western part of the pipeline is expected to be commissioned by 2009, and the eastern part by June 2011.

The capacity of the second pipeline is of natural gas per year. It is mainly supplied by the Central Asia-China gas pipeline. The pipeline is expected to cost US$20 billion. The project is developed by China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), a joint venture of China National Petroleum Corporation and PetroChina.

===West–East Gas Pipeline III===

Construction of the third pipeline started in October 2012 and it is to be completed by 2015. The third pipeline will run from Horgos in western Xinjiang to Fuzhou in Fujian. It will cross Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces.

The total length of the third pipeline is , including trunkline and eight branches. In addition, the project includes three gas storages and a LNG plant. It will have a capacity of of natural gas per year with operating pressure of . The pipeline will be supplied from Central Asia–China gas pipeline&#x27;s Line C supplemented by supplies from the Tarim basin and coalbed methane in Xinjiang. Compressors for the pipeline are supplied by Rolls-Royce.

==Controversies==
===Chemical spills===
In November 2005, one of PetroChina&#x27;s chemical plants exploded in Jilin, China, resulting in 100 tons of benzene, which is a carcinogen and toxic, pouring into the Songhua River. There was a slick of chemicals that spanned 80 kilometres. Harbin, which is another city along the Songhua River, had to cut the water supply from almost 4 million people, for 5 days. More than 60 people were injured, five died, and one person was missing due to the incident. The spill reached as far as Khabarovsk, Russia, where residents stocked up on bottled water. The Russian city tried filtering its water of toxic substances, but could not guarantee the water was safe. China&#x27;s environmental agency fined the company one million yuan (approximately $125,000, £64,000) for its pollution, which was the maximum fine that can be handed out in China for breaking an environmental law. The Chinese government said that cleaning up the aftermath would require one billion US dollars. Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Foreign Minister at the time, issued a public apology to Russia due to the incident. The Chinese press responded harshly to the authorities&#x27; response to the disaster.

In 2014, Petrochina&#x27;s subsidiary Lanzhou Petrochemical was responsible for ethylene and ammonia leaks, benzene contamination of water supplies, and air pollution in Lanzhou. City officials criticized the company and demanded an apology.

=== The &quot;Western Gas to the East&quot; Pipeline Project ===

PetroChina&#x27;s development of gas reserves in Tarim Basin, Xinjiang has been the subject of controversy, as such a project could pose a threat to the environment.

=== Demonstration at Chengdu plant ===
In 2008, PetroChina began constructing a $5.5 billion petrochemical plant, expected to produce 800,000 tons of ethylene and refine 10 million tons of crude oil a year, in Chengdu, China. Although PetroChina claimed that $565 million of the total investment would be dedicated to environmental protection, residents of Chengdu believed it might bring pollution to the local area and took to the streets on 3 and 4 May 2008, to protest the petrochemical plant. The whole demonstration was peaceful, with little Chinese government intervention.

=== Trade anomalies ===
On 19 January 2022, Chinese authorities punished PetroChina&#x27;s subsidiary &quot;PetroChina Fuel Oil Co Ltd&quot; for alleged oil trade inconsistencies that &quot;severely disrupted oil products market order... facilitated blind development of outdated production capacity at independent refineries...caused losses in government tax revenue indirectly,&quot; said the National Development and Reform Commission.

=== Human rights ===
In 2011, Earthrights International accused PetroChina of complicity in serious human rights abuses in Burma, a country known for militarily furthering its economic interests through the use of forced labor.

=== Corruption ===
In September 2013, Jiang Jiemin, a former chairman of PetroChina, was abruptly removed from his role as director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and investigated for corruption and abuse of power, along with four other senior oil executives. Jiang was considered an ally of corrupt former security chief Zhou Yongkang, and part of a group of officials that had political ties with Zhou. On 12 October 2015, the court found Jiang guilty on all counts, including accepting bribes, possessing dark assets, and abusing his power. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

In January 2017, former vice chairman Liao Yongyuan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for abuse of power and accepting nearly $2 million worth of bribes.

In October 2021, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that it was investigating former vice president Ling Xiao, for “serious disciplinary violations”.

=== Tax issues ===
In January 2014, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published research based on leaked financial records from the British Virgin Islands, implicating CNPC, PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC in offshore tax evasion.

== Ranking==
PetroChina was ranked 30th in 2018 &quot;Forbes Global 2000&quot;, a list of top listed companies of the world. In 2019, PetroChina was ranked 22nd in &quot;Forbes Global 2000.&quot; In 2023, PetroChina was ranked #18 in Forbes&#x27; Global 2000 (World&#x27;s Largest Public Companies).

== Corporate bonds ==
PetroChina, on 24 October 2008 issued a series of medium-term corporate bonds worth 80 billion yuan ($11.7 billion), which was the biggest ever domestic issue by a listed company.

== Logo ==
The logo of PetroChina has represented the company in plenary capacity since 2004. The logo&#x27;s basic, abecedarian design consists of a rising sun, projected onto a petal-based graphic. The colors utilized in the graphic are red and yellow, auspicious in Chinese culture. Beneath the English-language version of the design is positioned the company&#x27;s name in an emboldened, black typeset, &quot;PetroChina&quot; ().

PetroChina&#x27;s current logo was adopted 26 December 2004. The contour of the logo is defined as a &quot;petal graphic equally divided by ten in red and yellow colors&quot;, which, according to description, &quot;are the basic colors of the national flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and which embody the characteristics of the oil and gas industry&quot;. The essentially spherical design of the logo, meant to exemplify PetroChina&#x27;s global development stratagem. The ten equanimous petals are indicative of PetroChina&#x27;s ten consolidated core businesses. The red substratum is intended to highlight &quot;an angle of a square shape, not only demonstrating PetroChina&#x27;s strong fundamentals, but also implicating the company&#x27;s huge power of cohesion and creativity&quot;. The general floral connotations of the logo are designed to capture PetroChina&#x27;s &quot;social responsibility of creating harmony between energy and environment&quot;. Finally, the sun ascending over the horizon in the center of the logo epitomizes the prosperous future hoped to lie within the future of PetroChina.

<text>The United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) is a research and development and product management command of the United States Army. It develops, acquires, fields and sustains aviation, missile and unmanned aerial vehicles. AMCOM is primarily responsible for lifecycle management of Army missile, helicopter, unmanned ground vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle weapon systems. 

The central part of AMCOM&#x27;s mission involves acquisition and sustainment support for aviation systems, missile systems, and Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) throughout their product life cycle, from initial concept to safe disposal. The command is headquartered at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, has a 2019 &quot;budget of more $3.7 billion, and a global workforce of more than 15,000 military and civilian employees&quot;. Its other installations include Corpus Christi Army Depot; Letterkenny Army Depot, and the Army Aviation Center at Fort Novosel.

AMCOM works closely with The U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation &amp; Missile Center (AvMC) which operates simulation facilities to evaluate missile components, such as seekers, in a variety of flights and countermeasures environments. AMCOM also has access to several wind tunnels to test full-size helicopters, a vertical motion simulator for flight control evaluation and a crash-testing tower used to improve safety.

==Chronology==
The U.S. Army Missile Command was formally established on 23 May 1962 at Redstone Arsenal to manage the army&#x27;s missile systems.

*October 1948: The Chief of Ordnance designates Redstone Arsenal as the center for ordnance research and development in the field of rockets.
*1 June 1949: The Chief of Ordnance officially activates the arsenal as the site of the Ordnance Rocket Center.
*28 October 1949: The Secretary of the Army approves the transfer of the Ordnance Research and Development Division Sub-Office (Rocket) at Fort Bliss, Texas, to Redstone Arsenal as the Ordnance Guided Missile Center.
*1 February 1956: The U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) established at Redstone Arsenal.
*March, 1958: Organizations placed under the new Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) include the ABMA, Redstone Arsenal, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, White Sands Proving Grounds and the Army Rocket and Guided Missile Agency (ARGMA).
*July-October 1958: ABMA&#x27;s scientific and engineering staff including Wernher von BraunSaturn I team at Redstone Arsenal, transferred to the newly created NASA Marshall Space Flight Center at the southern half of Redstone Arsenal. Nearly the entirety of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were transferred to NASA, completely crushing any hope of an independent Army space program.
*1958: The Pershing Project Manager&#x27;s Office was created.
*23 May 1962: U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) officially established;, fully staffed and operational on 1 August 1962.
*28 February 1964: The U.S. Army Aviation and Surface Material Command redesignated as the U.S. Army Aviation Materiel Command (AVCOM).
*23 September 1968: AVCOM redesignated the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command (AVSCOM).
*1 July 1977: AVSCOM discontinued and its readiness mission combined with that of the U.S. Army Troop Support Command (TROSCOM) to form the U.S. Army Troop Support and Aviation Materiel Readiness Command (TSARCOM). AVSCOM&#x27;s aviation research and development mission assigned to the newly established U.S. Army Aviation Research and Development Command (AVRADCOM).
*1 March 1984: AVSCOM reestablished and all missions and activities of AVRADCOM and the aviation related missions and activities of the Troop Support and Aviation Materiel Readiness Command transferred to AVSCOM.
*1 October 1992: Army Aviation and Troop Command established, consolidating the existing missions of AVSCOM and TROSCOM less those missions and organizations transferred to other commands.
*8 September 1995: Congress approves the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission list, disestablishing ATCOM and transfers its mission and organizations to Redstone Arsenal to merge with the Army Missile Command to form AMCOM.
*17 July 1997: Army Aviation and Missile Command is provisionally established.
*1 October 1997: AMCOM formally established at Redstone Arsenal with the merger of the U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) at Redstone Arsenal and the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) at St. Louis, Missouri

== Components ==
AMCOM&#x27;s TMDE Activity provides worldwide command and control over a broad metrology and calibration program.

<doc id="1298130" wikidata="Q361987" url="?curid=1298130" title="Wapno">
<text>Wapno is a village in Wągrowiec County, in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, close to the border with Żnin County. &quot;Wapno&quot; is Polish for lime and reflects the large gypsum deposits in the area, which can be processed to produce lime. There are also large deposits of rock salt that were mined extensively beginning in the nineteenth century.

Wapno lies in the so-called Gniezno Lake District, and is close to several lakes. The village is north of the town of Wągrowiec.

==Municipal organization==
The present municipality (&quot;gmina&quot;) of Wapno includes the following hamlets in addition to the central village of Wapno:
*Aleksandrowo
*Graboszewo
*Komasin
*Podolin
*Rusiec
*Srebrna Góra
*Stołężyn

==History==
The town is first mentioned in 1299, in an entry in the Codex Diplomaticus Majoris Poloniae, which records the appearance of one Count Adam of Wapno at a trial in the court of one Count Rozal, concerning the rights of the Cistercian monastery in Łękno &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; the village of Dębogóra. At that time, Wapno was part of the Kuyavian principality headed by Duke Władyslaw I Łokietek (Vladislaus the Short), who became the second king of Poland upon his election in 1330.

Under Prussian rule, Wapno was part of South Prussia (1793–1807) and again of the Bromberg Region (1815–1919) in the Province of Posen (&quot;Prowincja Poznańska&quot;), interrupted only by it forming part of the Duchy of Warsaw. After World War I, it became part of the Second Polish Republic.

During the Invasion of Poland, the elementary school in Wapno served as the headquarters of the Polish 26th Infantry Division, a component of the Intervention Corps. Under the German Reichsgau Wartheland occupation (1939–1945), it was briefly (1944–1945) renamed &quot;Salzhof&quot; — &quot;Saltyard.&quot; In 1945, Wapno once again became part of Poland.

Since mediaeval times, Wapno has been known for the quality of its gypsum, which was used in the construction of the cathedrals at Gniezno and Poznań. There are also large salt deposits, consisting of salt domes intruding through the gypsum layer in diapirism. The salt and gypsum deposits under Wapno were subject to increasingly intensive extraction from 1828 onward, when landowner Florian Wilkoński began exploratory surface mining.

Output increased from 200 tonnes per year at the beginning of modern mining, to over 5,000 tonnes per year in 1850, with the pace accelerating after the introduction of steam power in 1835. Output began increasing again in the 1950s, accompanied by the construction of housing for up to 3,000 workers. Gypsum was processed on site, whereas beginning in 1887, after the construction of a line connecting Wapno and Nakło to Gniezno, salt was transported by rail to Nakło for processing.

On September 28, 1977, the Tadeusz Koscziusko saltmine underneath the town center collapsed, forcing the evacuation of around 1,000 residents. Wapno has never recovered economically from the loss of mining jobs after the accident, which has never been fully explained.A 2014 study found that a likely cause of the accident was exploitation of resources at the tenth (and lowest) level of the mine, along with preparatory work at the eighth and ninth levels, which study authors called a &quot;mistake,&quot; as room and pillar mining of rock salt tends to lead to the accumulation of fractures, fissures, and leaching of liquified sand and soil that lead to subsidence.

His story is passed down to us by 12th-century English historian William of Newburgh in his &quot;Historia rerum anglicarum&quot;, Book I, Chapter 24 entitled &quot;Of bishop Wimund, his life unbecoming a bishop, and how he was deprived of his sight&quot;.

==Wimund&#x27;s origins==
William records that Wimund was &quot;born in the most obscure spot in England&quot;. He was educated at Furness Abbey, then in Lancashire, founded 1123–1127 by the future Stephen I of England. Wimund may have been a member of the party sent from Furness to found a house at Rushen on the Isle of Man by request of Amlaíb mac Gofraid, the King of the Isles, in 1134.

King Amlaíb granted the monks of Furness the right to elect the Bishop of the Isles, and it appears that Wimund was elected to the see during the time of Thurstan (II), Archbishop of York. Thurstan died in early 1140, so that Wimund became Bishop of the Isles in the period 1134–1140. This was a very rapid rise for a young man of apparently obscure origins.

However, as William of Newburgh relates, Wimund in time claimed to be the son of the mormaer of Moray. William, and some later writers, doubted Wimund&#x27;s claims. Modern historians have been more inclined to take this claim seriously. Some have proposed that Wimund was a son of Óengus of Moray (died 1130), grandson of King Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin. However, his link with Cumbria has led to the supposition that Wimund was a son (possibly illegitimate) of William fitz Duncan, son of King Duncan II. William held extensive lands in Cumbria through his mother, Octreda, daughter of Cospatrick of Northumbria, and is believed to have been Mormaer or Earl of Moray between Óengus&#x27;s death in 1130 and his own death in 1147.

==Bishop Wimund==

The following is a summary of William of Newburgh&#x27;s account of the life of Bishop Wimund.

Wimund&#x27;s bishopric of the Isles had its seat on the Isle of Skye. The ruins of Snizort Cathedral, dedicated to Columba, are still visible near Skeabost. William of Newburgh writes that Wimund, &quot;[n]ot content with the dignity of his episcopal office, he next anticipated in his mind how he might accomplish great and wonderful things; for he possessed a haughty speaking mouth with the proudest heart.&quot;

However, Wimund&#x27;s father, if he was indeed the son of William fitz Duncan, was alive for the first seven years at least of his time as a Bishop of the Isles. So long as his father was alive, Wimund need hardly &quot;[feign] himself to be the son of the earl of Moray and that he was deprived of the inheritance of his fathers by the king of Scotland&quot; as William says. But William may be anticipating himself; Wimund&#x27;s first conflict was not with his uncle King David I, but with a fellow bishop, and there is no reason to suppose that these two conflicts were linked.

During Wimund&#x27;s episcopate, or shortly before its beginning, Gille Aldan was consecrated Bishop of Whithorn, probably by the agreement of Fergus of Galloway and Archbishop Thurstan, and with the approval of Pope Honorius III. The lands of the recreated Bishopric of Whithorn had probably been subject to the Bishops of the Isles, and for rival bishops to employ armed force to drive off their rivals was hardly unknown. Thus, rather than to gain his inheritance, Wimund&#x27;s struggle with Gille Aldan was apparently an attempt to prevent his bishopric being partitioned in favour of a rival. 

After being captured, he was blinded and castrated and spent the rest of his life at the monastery at Byland Abbey in North Yorkshire.

<text>Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Nalliah (born 1964) is a Sri Lankan Australian evangelical Christian pastor. He was the leader of the now-dissolved Rise Up Australia political party and is the president of Catch the Fire Ministries. Nalliah defended against a lawsuit brought by the Islamic Council of Victoria under Victoria&#x27;s Racial and Religious Tolerance Act. In this case, Judge Michael Higgins found in favour of the Islamic Council of Victoria, which took the action against Catch the Fire, but his decision was overturned by the Victorian Court of Appeal.

Nalliah used to be associated with the Australian Christian Churches.

== Early years ==
According to his biography published by the Catch the Fire Ministries, Daniel Nalliah was born in Sri Lanka to minority Sri Lankan Tamil parents who spoke English as their first language. However, he was schooled at the Nugegoda Tamil Mahavidyalaya in Colombo, where all teaching was in done in Tamil. He was introduced to the &quot;ways of God&quot; by an Australian missionary. In his youth, he played at a number of night clubs in Colombo as a drummer before turning to religion. He also worked as an underground missionary in Saudi Arabia before migrating to Australia in 1997.

After moving to Australia and founding Catch the Fire Ministries, Nalliah travelled extensively, preaching to congregations in a number of countries. He asserts that he witnessed the healing of blind, deaf and crippled people at his prayer sessions and also claims that a dead girl was resurrected after he prayed for her.

He is a young earth creationist.

==Vilification of Muslims lawsuit==

On 9 March 2002, Daniel Scot spoke at a seminar regarding Islam, sponsored by Catch the Fire Ministries. The seminar was attended by three Australian Muslims; two of them were asked to attend by May Helou, an executive member of the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) and an employee of the Equal Opportunity Commission, Victoria. The third person was asked to attend by ICV members while he was at the ICV office. The three Muslims, along with the Islamic Council of Victoria, later launched action under the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act, claiming that the intent of the speech had been to vilify Muslims rather than to discuss Islam itself. After being considered by the Equal Opportunity Commission, the case was heard by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), becoming the first real test case under the act.

In a landmark ruling on 17 December 2004, the tribunal ruled that Nalliah, Scot and Catch the Fire Ministries had breached the law. Judge Higgins heard further submissions regarding &quot;remedies&quot; early in 2005. Nalliah publicly condemned the verdict and declared his intention to continue fighting the case, potentially as far as the High Court of Australia. &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper quoted him as stating, &quot;We may have lost the battle, but the war is not over. The law has to be removed, there is no question.&quot;

On 22 June 2005, Judge Michael Higgins of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal delivered his final verdict on the religious vilification issue regarding remedies. He found that financial compensation would be inappropriate but ordered Nalliah and Scot to take out newspaper advertisements to the value of $68,690 that summarised the findings in the case. Nalliah criticised the ruling, comparing the legislation to &quot;sharia law by stealth&quot;. He also said that he would rather go to jail than comply with the ruling. Lawyers for the defendants had previously appealed to the Supreme Court of Victoria, in an originating motion alleging that Higgins showed signs of bias, that there were errors in the decision and that the act itself was unconstitutional. Following the decision, an appeal was lodged with the Court of Appeal, and the originating motion was dropped. The appeal was heard in August 2006.

The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an interfaith public interest law firm based in Washington, D.C., had intervened on Scot&#x27;s behalf, engaging in discussion with the Attorney General of Australia, providing legal representation with local counsel and providing legal arguments employed for the legal appeal. On 14 December 2006, the Court of Appeal of Victoria upheld the appeal and ordered that the matter be redecided without hearing new evidence by a judge (other than Judge Higgins) of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The Islamic Council of Victoria was ordered to pay half of Scot&#x27;s and Nalliah&#x27;s legal costs of the appeal.

The matter was eventually resolved without a VCAT hearing after mediation between the two parties. On 22 June 2007 VCAT published a statement agreed to by both parties which affirmed everyone&#x27;s rights to &quot;robustly debate religion including the right to criticise the religious belief of another, in a free, open and democratic society&quot;.

== Political activity ==
===Family First party===
In November 2004, Nalliah campaigned for a seat in the Australian Senate as a candidate of the Family First Party. He was slotted second on the party&#x27;s Victorian Senate list but failed to be elected. Nevertheless, his candidacy caused considerable controversy when National Party Senate candidate Barnaby Joyce launched a heavily publicised attack on Family First and his own party&#x27;s preference deal with them the day before the election. Joyce highlighted a quote from one of Nalliah&#x27;s brochures that asked parishioners to pray that God would pull down &quot;Satan&#x27;s strongholds&quot;, which included brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and temples (including Freemason, Buddhist and Hindu temples). Joyce used Nalliah&#x27;s derogatory statements about minority groups to describe Family First as &quot;not the sort of people you do preference deals with.&quot;

In late October 2009, the Family First parliamentary leader, Senator Steve Fielding, noted that after the incident cited above Nalliah was asked to leave the party and did so. At the same time, Nalliah argued that the discovery of an adolescent &quot;satanist&quot; Black Mass site in Canberra&#x27;s Mount Ainslie indicated that the federal parliament was &quot;under attack&quot; and referred to witchcraft, liberal abortion laws and legislation that supported LGBT rights in Australia as the &quot;reason&quot; behind an apparent spate of parliamentary marriage crises.

===Rise Up Australia Party===
On 22 June 2011, Nalliah launched a new political party, Rise Up Australia, which he leads. Stated aims of the party include the protection of freedom of speech, freedom of religion and preserving Australia&#x27;s &quot;Judeo-Christian heritage&quot;.

==Political views==
===Black Saturday bushfires===
In the wake of the Black Saturday bushfires, in which 173 died, Nalliah claimed he had received &quot;prophetic dreams&quot; on 21 October 2008 that these bushfires were a &quot;consequence&quot; of Victoria&#x27;s decriminalisation of abortion in 2008, prompting criticism from a former Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello, that Nalliah&#x27;s assertion was &quot;beyond the bounds of decency&quot;.

===Holsworthy Barracks terror plot===
Nalliah planned to use the Holsworthy Barracks terror plot as an argument to explain that Christianity should be protected &quot;as the core value of the nation&quot; in his speech titled &quot;Is the West being de-Christianised?&quot; delivered at the Australian Christian Nation Association Annual National Conference held on 21 November 2009 at the Assyrian Sport and Cultural Club, Fairfield Heights, Sydney.

===Queensland floods in 2010-2011===
After the catastrophic 2010–11 Queensland floods, Nalliah declared on his website &quot;at once I was reminded of Kevin Rudd speaking against Israel in Israel on 14 December 2010. It is very interesting that Kevin Rudd is from QLD. Is God trying to get our attention? Yes, I believe so.&quot;

===Views on homosexuality===
In a 2011 interview with Perth&#x27;s &quot;Out in Perth&quot;, Nalliah stated that homosexuals can be turned back to heterosexual relationships through education and through Christ. &quot;As a political party, while we love the homosexual community and want to get to know them better, we also have a stand where we say, children need to be protected. We would love to see every man and woman come together, there&#x27;s a time in life when you do things, and maybe you feel yes you are locked into an agenda... [our position] is that homosexuality is not OK.&quot; He also said that &quot;Children should not be exposed to [public displays of homosexual affection] and other practices that go beyond morality.&quot;

===Views on multiculturalism===
&quot;We also know that Stalin and his communist ideologies were responsible for the murder of millions of people. Although communist ideologies seemed to be very good to many millions of people, the end result was much death and destruction. In other words, &#x27;One Word&#x27; becomes a gate way to lead to great disaster if we don&#x27;t wake up in time. We have seen Nazism and Communism destroy many nations.

&quot;So we need to take a good look at the word &#x27;Multiculturalism&#x27;. Although this word seems to sound so good, in reality it is currently destroying the Judeo-Christian West and replacing it with an &#x27;Interfaith&#x27; deceptive agenda led by the United Nations. It is Communism wearing a new uniform. It is also worth noting that the first few letters of this word is &quot;Multicult&quot;-uralism.&quot;

<doc id="1298153" wikidata="Q865222" url="?curid=1298153" title="Proclamation of Timișoara">
<text>The Proclamation of Timișoara was a thirteen-point written document, drafted on March 11, 1990, by the Timișoara participants in Romania&#x27;s 1989 Revolution, and partly issued in reaction to the first Mineriad. Organized as the &quot;Timișoara Society&quot; and other bodies of students and workers, the signers expressed liberal-democratic goals, which they saw as representing the revolutionary legacy. The best-known requirement formed the document&#x27;s 8th Point, calling for all former Romanian Communist Party &quot;nomenklatura&quot; and Securitate cadres to be banned from holding public office for a period of 10 years (or three consecutive legislatures), with an emphasis on the office of President (&quot;see Lustration&quot;). Questioning the status of the governing National Salvation Front, the Proclamation argued that the latter primarily represented a small group of Communist dissidents who had opposed Nicolae Ceauşescu&#x27;s authoritarian regime and had subsequently monopolized power. These requirements replicated the earlier manifesto authored in Bucharest by philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu (&quot;Apel către &quot;, the &quot;Appeal to the Scoundrels&quot;).

Over the following period, the document was recognized and advocated by hundreds of civic associations, while almost 4 million citizens signed appeals in favor of incorporating the 8th Point into electoral law. The latter was also one of the main requests of the Bucharest Golaniad (which was violently repressed during the third Mineriad in June of the same year).

==Character==
In its final shape, the text owed much to the inspiration of George Şerban, a local academic and writer. According to historian Victor Neumann, Șerban was in turn inspired by his collaborator Alexandra Indrieş, an influential intellectual and a former political prisoner during the 1950s. After being written down, the Proclamation was publicly read by Șerban from the National Opera&#x27;s balcony.

One of the purposes stated in the document was the explicit condemnation of Communism. Proclaiming class solidarity, the text opposed &quot;the typically communist method of domination by spreading feuds among social classes&quot;. While expressing the will of &quot;not copy[ing] the western capitalist systems with their drawbacks and inequities&quot;, the 10th Point of the Proclamation argued in favor of privatization (expressed ideally under the form of &quot;distributing the stocks equally among the workers, the state keeping only those funds that may ensure the control of the activity&quot;) and immediate investments in the public sector (as a means to prevent the consequences of inflation). The 11th Point also made mention of Timișoara&#x27;s openness to a market economy, decentralization, and foreign capital, proposing for a foreign trade bank to be opened in the city. The text also expressed a hope that members of the Romanian diaspora who had left the country under the Communist regime were to return to their homeland and contribute to the society, and set itself against the portion of the public &quot;who, instigated by obscure forces, abused the returned exiles&quot;.

A similar call for solidarity was expressed in regard to ethnic relations (the document stated opposition to all forms of &quot;chauvinism&quot;, depicting Timișoara as the paramount representative of &quot;the spirit of tolerance and mutual respect, the sole principles reigning in the future European House&quot;), and a multi-party system based on free elections was endorsed, with the exclusion of &quot;extremist [parties], be they leftist or rightist&quot;. The document also proposed that the Romanian Communist Party had failed to meet the criteria for participation in Romanian politics, having &quot;discredited itself by degenerating into red fascism&quot;. In its 7th Point, the Proclamation indicated that activists of the Communist Party had displayed &quot;cowardice&quot; as early as 1979, by refusing to join Constantin Pîrvulescu in open disobedience to Ceaușescu. The 6th point condemned &quot;prejudice&quot; and &quot;manipulation&quot; against the emerging opposition parties (specifically, the historical National Peasants&#x27; Party and National Liberals), citing examples where the &quot;groups interested in resuscitating communism&quot; had incited public sentiment with slogans of reportedly Stalinist inspiration.

Neumann attributed several of the radical social and economic goals, as well as the moral discourse associated with the 8th Point requirements, to the authors&#x27; awareness of Marxist theories (for a certain period, George Şerban had taught Marxism at the Timișoara Polytechnic University). While commending the document for thus identifying and radically condemning Communist practices, he expressed his personal opposition to the 8th Point, which he believed to be rooted in &quot;Marxist historicism&quot; and attempting to impose a &quot;moral code&quot; in &quot;situations [that] call for a series of compromises&quot;.

A final demand regarded proposals that December 22, the date of revolutionary victory in Bucharest, be proclaimed the national holiday of Romania. The text argued against such a move, and, citing the example of Bastille Day in France, proposed December 16, when revolution broke in Timișoara, as the moment of celebration. Eventually, the 1991 Constitution enforced an unrelated event, Union Day (December 1), as the legal holiday.

==Aftermath==
Authors have attributed the limited success of the Proclamation movement to both resistance from surviving Communist structures and the special characteristics of Timișoara in relation to the rest of the country. Victor Neumann mentioned contrasts observed during the Revolution itself, when &quot;only a few cities rebelled [...] alongside Timișoara: Arad, Lugoj, Sibiu, Cluj, Braşov, Bucharest, Iaşi&quot;. He attributed this pattern to political, economic and social discrepancies between various areas of the country, ones he believed to have been prolonged in post-Revolution Romania. Analyst Enikő Baga contended that policy differences also remained notable between Timișoara and its subordinate Timiș County.

While commenting on the multi-ethnic character of the Revolution as mirrored in the Proclamation itself, Steven D. Roper made mention of the nationalist revival which was made obvious less than a week after the document was publicized (culminating in the ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureş and the creation of the Romanian National Unity Party). At the time, the National Salvation Front accused the Proclamation of seeking political autonomy for the Banat.

The Proclamation of Timișoara was unsuccessful in its goal of shaping electoral procedures: the presidential and legislative election of May 1990 were carried without lustration requirements. Results confirmed the victory of the National Salvation Front as ruling party and of Ion Iliescu, a former Communist official who had opposed Ceaușescu, as President.

Despite this outcome, although reduced in amplitude, the Golaniad protests continued in Bucharest&#x27;s University Square, and gave ongoing support to the Proclamation. In his previous polemic with the demonstrators, Iliescu argued that the Proclamation was likely to cause &quot;a dangerous witch-hunt&quot;. Leaders of the protest rejected this view, indicating that the Proclamation did not call for punishment, but rather for accurate representation. After the controversial intervention of Romanian Police forces, and retaliation from the protesters, the newly-elected president made a public appeal which resulted in a violent intervention by groups of miners arriving from the Jiu Valley.

==Legacy==
The cause of lustration as prescribed by the Timișoara 8th Point was advocated in Parliament by representatives of National Peasants&#x27; Party and National Liberal Party, but faced opposition from the governing National Salvation Front and its successor party — which eventually grouped itself as the Social Democratic Party.

On May 27, 1999, following the elections of 1996 which confirmed the victory of the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR, comprising the National Peasants&#x27; and National Liberal Party together with other groups), a legislative project seeking this goal was proposed inside the Chamber of Deputies by George Şerban, elected as a National Peasants&#x27; Party member; however, since 1997, the 8th Point was disavowed by the new President Emil Constantinescu, who stressed his belief that it was &quot;no longer applicable&quot;.

The project remained to be analyzed by the Chamber&#x27;s Judicial Committee over the following seven months, and many of its provisions were ultimately objected to, while it failed to win a parallel verdict from Prime Minister Mugur Isărescu; it was outvoted by a new Social Democratic majority in February 2001, following the 2000 elections. (Șerban had died in late December 1998.)

According to several commentators, the project was intentionally blocked. The journal &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot; indicated the Social Democrat parliamentarian Dan Marţian, who served as president of the Commission and whose position was threatened by lustration, as one of those responsible for the alleged action.

In the wake of the 2004 elections, confirming the victory of the Justice and Truth grouping comprising National Liberals and Democrats, lustration was again brought to the attention of Parliament. This involved two separate projects: that of National Initiative Party politicians Cozmin Guşă, Lavinia Șandru and Aurelian Pavelescu was rejected in Senate (November 2005); a second one, advocated by National Liberal parliamentarians Adrian Cioroianu, Mona Muscă, Viorel Oancea, and Mihăiţă Calimente and backed by the &quot;Timișoara Society&quot;, was eventually adopted by the Senate in early April 2006. It won additional backing from the Association of Former Political Prisoners and its president, Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu.

Of the proposals, the former was more radical, calling for lustration to be applied permanently to all persons occupying public office under the Communist regime (whereas the National Liberal project restricts it to Communist Party and Union of Communist Youth active cadres, as well as to persons engaged in political policing in relation to the Securitate). At the time of its presentation to Parliament, Cioroianu stated: &quot;The law will be a real test of morality for the political parties&quot;. In parallel, British historian Dennis Deletant has argued that lustration was intrinsically connected with the necessity for publicizing Securitate files kept by the CNSAS and the Romanian Intelligence Service. He also contrasted the manifest delays in Romanian procedures with the similar processes in three other former Eastern Bloc countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary).

<text>Leonid Borisovich Kogan (; ; 14 November 1924 – 17 December 1982) was a preeminent Soviet violinist during the 20th century. Many consider him to be among the greatest violinists of the 20th century. In particular, he is considered to have been one of the greatest representatives of the Soviet School of violin playing.

==Life and career==
Kogan was born to a Jewish family in Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro), the son of a photographer. After he showed an early interest and ability for violin playing, his family moved to Moscow, where he was able to further his studies. From age ten he studied there with the noted violin pedagogue Abram Yampolsky. In 1934, Jascha Heifetz played concerts in Moscow. &quot;I attended every one,&quot; Kogan later said, &quot;and can remember until now every note he played. He was the ideal artist for me.&quot; When Kogan was 12, Jacques Thibaud was in Moscow and heard him play. The French virtuoso predicted a great future for Kogan.

Kogan studied at the Central Music School in Moscow (1934–43), then at the Moscow Conservatory (1943–48), where he studied as a postgraduate (1948–51).

At the age of 17, and while still a student, he performed throughout the Soviet Union. He was co-winner of the first prize at the World Youth Festival in Prague. In 1951, Kogan won first prize at the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels with a dazzling performance of Paganini&#x27;s first concerto that included an outstanding interpretation of Sauret&#x27;s cadenza.

His official debut was in 1941, playing the Brahms Concerto with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.

His international solo tours took him to Paris and London in 1955, and then South America and the United States in the following years. Kogan had a repertoire of over 18 concerti and a number of concerti by modern composers were dedicated to him.

In 1952, Kogan began teaching at the Moscow Conservatory, and in 1980 he was invited to teach at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, Italy.

Kogan, a brilliant and compelling violinist who excelled in both the concerto repertoire and in chamber music, shunned publicity. His career was always overshadowed by that of David Oistrakh, who was strongly promoted by the Soviet authorities. Like Oistrakh, Kogan made a few studio recordings in the West, mostly for EMI. The bulk of his recordings were made in the Soviet Union, however, and their availability outside that country was very rare until the release of the Brilliant box set &quot;Historic Russian Archives Leonid Kogan Edition&quot; 

Kogan was made a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR in 1964, and received the Lenin Prize in 1965.

Kogan married Elizabeth Gilels (sister of pianist Emil Gilels), also a concert violinist. His son, Pavel Kogan (b. 1952) became a famous violinist and conductor. His daughter, Nina Kogan (b. 1954), is a concert pianist and became the accompanist and sonata partner of her father at an early age.

Kogan died of a heart attack in the city of Mytishchi, while travelling by train between Moscow and Yaroslavl to a concert he was to perform with his son. Two days before, he had played the Beethoven Violin Concerto in Vienna. He was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery.

Many speculate that Kogan played on all steel strings, though there is not an outright confirmation. While his close associates indicate he played on gut strings except for a steel &#x27;e&#x27; string, it is most likely that he used different combinations over the course of his career.

==Instruments==
Kogan used two Guarneri del Gesù violins: the 1726 ex-Colin and the 1733 ex-Burmester. He used French bows by Dominique Peccatte. Kogan never actually owned these instruments; they were provided on loan from the Soviet government. Today they are worth more than US$4 million.

==Recordings==
Kogan formed a trio with pianist Emil Gilels and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Their recordings include Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Archduke Trio&quot;, the Schumann D minor, the Tchaikovsky, the Saint-Saëns, the Horn Trio by Brahms with Yakov Shapiro (horn), and the Fauré C minor Quartet with Rudolf Barshai (viola). Kogan later formed another trio with conductor Yevgeny Svetlanov (piano) and (cello). Kogan was the first Soviet violinist to play and record Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto. He also made a famous recording of Khachaturian&#x27;s Violin Concerto with Pierre Monteux and the Boston Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor (his American debut recording), a version still considered the most exciting reading of the work. Kogan recorded violin concerti by other Soviet composers, including the two by Tikhon Khrennikov. With Karl Richter, Kogan recorded J. S. Bach&#x27;s six Violin Sonatas in 1972.

There are more than 30 albums of his performances on the Arlecchino label. In 2006, EMI France issued a 4-CD box set (&quot;Les Introuvables de Leonid Kogan&quot;) containing his concerto recordings for that label, all digitally remastered the same year.

The EMI Kogan recordings from 1950s and 1960s used to belong to Columbia, who released about five stereo recordings of Kogan in the vinyl record period: Beethoven &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; (SAX 2386), Brahms &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; (SAX 2307), Tchaikovsky &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; (SAX 2323), Lalo &quot;Symphonie espagnole&quot; (SAX 2329) and Leclair/Telemann/Ysaye &quot;Sonatas for duo Violins&quot; (SAX 2531). Nowadays, these Kogan records are among the most sought-after records for classical vinyl collectors. For example, the price of the Beethoven &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; (SAX2386) record soars up to 10,000 dollars in eBay auctions.

<doc id="1298157" wikidata="Q3077582" url="?curid=1298157" title="Rand formula">
<text>In Canadian labour law, the Rand formula (also referred to as &quot;automatic check-off&quot; and &quot;compulsory checkoff&quot;) is a compromise arising from jurisprudence struck between organized labour (trade unions) and employers that guarantees employers industrial stability by requiring all workers affected by a collective agreement to pay dues to the union by mandatory deduction in exchange for the union agreement to &quot;work now, grieve later.&quot;

Historically, in some workplaces, some workers refused to pay dues to the union even after benefiting from wage and benefit improvements negotiated by the union representatives, resulting in friction and violence as they were seen as &quot;freeloaders&quot;; at the same time, absence of a peaceful grievance settlement mechanism created industrial instability as union members often walked off the job. The Rand formula compromise was designed to ensure that no employee will opt out of the union simply to avoid dues yet reap the benefits of collective bargaining, such as higher wages or health insurance.

Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ivan Rand, the eponym of this law, introduced this formula in 1946 as an arbitration decision ending the Ford Strike of 1945 in Windsor, Ontario. The &quot;Canada Labour Code&quot; and the labour relations laws of a majority of provinces contain provisions requiring the Rand formula when certain conditions are met. In those provinces where the labour relations laws do not make the Rand formula mandatory, the automatic check-off of union dues may become part of the collective bargaining agreement if both parties (i.e., the employer and the trade union) agree. If there are religious objections to paying dues the dues may be donated to a mutually agreed upon charity.

== Compulsory check-off ==
Union dues to be deducted

70. (1) Where a trade union that is the bargaining agent for employees in a bargaining unit so requests, there shall be included in the collective agreement between the trade union and the employer of the employees a provision requiring the employer to deduct from the wages of each employee in the unit affected by the collective agreement, whether or not the employee is a member of the union, the amount of the regular union dues and to remit the amount to the trade union forthwith.

Religious objections

(2) Where the Board is satisfied that an employee, because of their religious conviction or beliefs, objects to joining a trade union or to paying regular union dues to a trade union, the Board may order that the provision in a collective agreement requiring, as a condition of employment, membership in a trade union or requiring the payment of regular union dues to a trade union does not apply to that employee so long as an amount equal to the amount of the regular union dues is paid by the employee, either directly or by way of deduction from their wages, to a registered charity mutually agreed on by the employee and the trade union.

Designation by Board

(3) Where an employee and the trade union are unable to agree on a registered charity for the purposes of subsection (2), the Board may designate any such charity as the charity to which payment should be made.
== Freedom of association issue ==

The Rand formula applies to all employees whether they are union members or not in those workplaces where the majority of the employees vote to form a union. The Supreme Court of Canada has found that the freedom of association is not undermined by the Rand formula. In the 1991 &quot;Lavigne&quot; decision, the Justices of the Court held in various concurring reasons that if the Rand formula did violate section 2(d), it could be justified under section 1 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; as it fundamentally does no more than what is commonplace in a democratic society – the will of the majority prevails, as in the decisions of parliament, and those in the minority are bound by the decision of the majority.
I would suggest that a worker like Lavigne would have no chance of succeeding if his objection to his association with the Union was the extent that it addresses itself to the matters, the terms and conditions of employment for members of his bargaining unit, with respect to which he is &quot;naturally&quot; associated with his fellow employees. Few would think he should not be required to pay for the services the Union renders him in this context. Significantly, he does not object to these matters. With respect to these, the Union is simply viewed as a reasonable vehicle by which the necessary interconnections of Lavigne and his fellow workers is expressed.
When, however, the Union purports to express itself in respect to matters reflecting aspects of Lavigne&#x27;s identity and membership in the community that go beyond his bargaining unit and its immediate concerns, his claim to the protection of the Charter cannot as easily be dismissed. In regard to these broader matters, his claim is not to absolute isolation but to be free to make his own choices, unfettered by the opinion of those he works with, as to what associations, if any, he will be associated with outside the workplace.
==Reception==
The Rand Formula has been implemented in a variety of legal contexts and although interpreted by its critics as binding businesses to violate the free choice of their employees, and as having a negative effect in that it limits individual choice on whether or not to pay union dues in a manner incompatible with market economies it has been generally well received. The positive reception of the Rand formula came mostly from unions and their allies with conservative Canadians voicing the most opposition. The rationale for the Rand formula being stated as “unions are service providers entitled to appropriate compensation for the services they provide” demonstrating that the Rand formula was viewed by the judiciary as a reasonable limit on personal economic freedom in a free market economy such as Canada&#x27;s. The Formula was largely perceived by businesses and individuals in Canada as a compromise between the extremes of mandatory union membership and universal non-unionism.

<text>News design is the process of arranging material on a newspaper page, according to editorial and graphical guidelines and goals. Main editorial goals include the ordering of news stories by order of importance, while graphical considerations include readability and balanced, unobtrusive incorporation of advertising.
News design incorporates principles of graphic design and is taught as part of journalism training in schools and colleges. Overlapping and related terms include layout, makeup (formerly paste up) and pagination.

The era of modern newspapers begins in the mid-nineteenth century, with the Industrial Revolution, and increased capacities for printing and distribution. Over time, improvements in printing technology, graphical design, and editorial standards have led to changes and improvements in the look and readability of newspapers. Nineteenth-century newspapers were often densely packed with type, often arranged vertically, with multiple headlines for each article. A number of the same technological limitations persisted until the advent of digital typesetting and pagination in late 20th century.

== Process ==
Designers typically use desktop publishing software to arrange the elements on the pages directly. In the past, before digital pre-press pagination, designers used precise &quot;lay out dummies&quot; to direct the exact layout of elements for each page.

A complete layout dummy was required for designating proper column widths by which a typesetter would set type, and arrange columns of text. Layout also required the calculation of lengths of copy (text in &quot;column inches&quot;), for any chosen width.

Much of the variance and incoherence of early newspapers was because last minute corrections were exclusively handled by typesetters. With photographic printing process, typesetting gave way to paste-up, whereby columns of type were printed by machines (phototypesetters) on high-resolution film for paste-up on photographed final prints. These prints in turn were &quot;shot to negative&quot; with a large format production camera —directly to steel-emulsion photographic plates.

Though paste-up put an end to cumbersome typesetting, this still required planned layouts and set column widths. Photographic plates are (still) wrapped on printing drums to directly apply ink to newsprint (paper).
In the mid-1990s, the paste-up process gave way to the direct to plate process, where computer-paginated files were optically transmitted directly to the photographic plate. Replacing several in-between steps in newspaper production, direct to plate pagination allowed for much more flexibility and precision than before. Designers today still used column grid layouts only with layout software, such as Adobe InDesign or Quark.

== Design options ==
Designers choose photo sizes and headline sizes (both the size of the letters and how much space the headline will take). They may decide what articles will go on which pages, and where on the page, alone or in consultation with editors. They may choose typefaces for special pages, but newspapers usually have a design style that determines most routine uses.

== Notable news designers ==

John E. Allen in &quot;Linotype News&quot; of the 1930s was the first to write extensively about the design of the U.S. press, followed at mid century by Syracuse journalism professor Edmund Arnold, sometimes identified as the father of &quot;modern&quot; newspaper design, and journalist Harold Evans played a key role in British news design later in the century.
