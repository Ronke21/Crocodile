<text>The East Bay is the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay Area and includes cities along the eastern shores of the San Francisco Bay and San Pablo Bay. The region has grown to include inland communities in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. With a population of roughly 2.8 million in 2024, it is the most populous subregion in the Bay Area, containing the second- and third-most populous Bay Area counties of Alameda (1.7 million) and Contra Costa (1.1 million).

Oakland is the largest city in the East Bay by population and the third largest in the Bay Area. The city serves as a major transportation hub for the U.S. West Coast, and its port is the largest in Northern California. Increased population has led to the growth of large edge cities such as Alameda, Concord, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Pleasanton, San Ramon, and Walnut Creek.

==History and development==
Although initial development in the greater Bay Area focused on San Francisco, the coastal East Bay came to prominence in the middle of the 19th century as the part of the Bay Area most accessible by land from the east. The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 with its western terminus at the newly constructed Oakland Long Wharf, and the new city of Oakland rapidly developed into a significant seaport. Today the Port of Oakland is the Bay Area&#x27;s largest port and the fifth largest container shipping port in the United States. In 1868, the University of California was formed from the private College of California and a new campus was built in what would become Berkeley. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake saw a large number of refugees flee to the relatively undamaged East Bay, and the region continued to grow rapidly. As the East Bay grew, the push to connect it with a more permanent link than ferry service resulted in the completion of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge in 1936.

The Bay Area saw further growth in the decades following World War II, with the population doubling between 1940 and 1960, and doubling again by 2000. The 1937 completion of the Caldecott Tunnel through the Berkeley Hills fueled growth further east, where there was undeveloped land. Cities in the Diablo Valley, including Concord and Walnut Creek, saw their populations increase tenfold or more between 1950 and 1970. The addition of the BART commuter rail system in 1972 further encouraged development in increasingly far-flung regions of the East Bay. Today, the valleys east of the Berkeley Hills contain large affluent suburban communities such as Walnut Creek, San Ramon and Pleasanton.

The East Bay is not a formally defined region, aside from its being described as a region inclusive of Alameda and Contra Costa counties. As development moves generally eastward, new areas are described as being part of the East Bay. In 1996, BART was extended from its terminus in Concord to a new station in Pittsburg, symbolically incorporating the newly expanded Delta communities of Pittsburg and Antioch as extended regions of the East Bay. Beyond the borders of Alameda County, the large population of Tracy is connected as a bedroom community housing commuters traveling to or through the East Bay.

==Cities==
Except for some hills and ridges which exist as parklands or undeveloped land, and some farmland in eastern Contra Costa and Alameda Counties, the East Bay is highly urbanized. The East Bay shoreline is an urban corridor with several cities exceeding 100,000 residents, including the cities of Oakland, Hayward, Fremont, Richmond, and Berkeley. In the inland valleys on the east side of the Berkeley Hills, the land is mostly developed, particularly on the eastern fringe of Contra Costa county and the Tri-Valley area. In the inland valleys, the population density is less and the cities smaller. Cities exceeding 100,000 residents in the inland valleys include Antioch and Concord.

==Culture==
The East Bay has a free weekly newspaper, the &quot;East Bay Express&quot;, which has reported on the culture and politics of the East Bay for over 30 years, and has influenced the identification of the East Bay as a culturally defined region of the Bay Area. &quot;The East Bay Monthly&quot;, another free newspaper, has been published since 1970. In the early years of the evolution of &quot;USA Today&quot;, during the early 1980s, they operated regional newspapers, with the region&#x27;s paper entitled &quot;East Bay Today&quot;.

The Solano Avenue Stroll, the oldest and largest street festival in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, is held every September on the Solano Avenue shopping district in Albany and Berkeley.

The East Bay is the birthplace of many musical acts, including Creedence Clearwater Revival, Country Joe and the Fish. Counting Crows, Yesterday and Today, Digital Underground, Green Day, Operation Ivy, Primus, Rancid, Set Your Goals, Tower of Power (whose debut album is titled &quot;East Bay Grease&quot;), The Pointer Sisters, MC Hammer, Tony! Toni! Toné!, Tupac Shakur, Too Short, Spice 1, en Vogue, Pete Escovedo and Sheila E, Keyshia Cole, and Mac Dre. The region is a major center for the development of rock, folk, funk, jazz, hip hop, soul and women&#x27;s music.

Bay Area thrash metal has centered strongly on the East Bay, including the bands Exodus and Metallica, among others. Possessed and Death, both considered the first death metal bands, have roots or connections in the East Bay: Possessed formed in El Sobrante, with Death debuting nationally while in Concord.

Major music (and sports) venues include the Oakland Arena; adjacent Oakland Coliseum; the Oakland Paramount Theater, venue for the Oakland East Bay Symphony; the Fox Oakland Theatre, the UC Berkeley Greek Theater, the nonprofit The Freight and Salvage, and the Concord Pavilion (formerly Sleep Train Pavilion).

Major museums include the Oakland Museum of California, the Lawrence Hall of Science and the Chabot Space and Science Center.

The East Bay Regional Parks District operates over fifty parks, many consisting of significant acreage of wildlands, in the East Bay, many directly adjacent to urban centers. Tilden Regional Park, is one of the largest regional parks () located directly adjacent to the urban center of Berkeley. Briones Regional Park, at 5,000 acres, is another large wildlands park near an urban center, Walnut Creek.

The East Bay also has a rich political history. One of the revolutionary movements founded in Oakland was the Black Panther Party.

The East Bay is home to many of the restaurants central to the creation of California cuisine, including Chez Panisse.

==Transportation==

All vehicular crossings of the San Francisco Bay land in the counties comprising the East Bay. Interstate highways in the East Bay include Interstates 80, 580, 680, 880, 980, and 238. California State Routes 24, 4, 13, 92, 160, 242, 84, and Richmond Parkway are limited access highways for at least part of their lengths in the area. State Route 61, State Route 84, State Route 123, State Route 185, and State Route 238 are major surface streets that receive state funding for maintenance. San Pablo Avenue previously carried U.S. Route 40 until the terminus was moved progressively east to Utah.

AC Transit is the major bus transit agency for the region, and provides bus service throughout Alameda and Contra Costa counties, hence the &quot;AC&quot; moniker. County Connection, WestCAT, WHEELS, Tri Delta Transit and Union City Transit also provide bus service in the East Bay.

Ferry service is provided by San Francisco Bay Ferry from Jack London Square and Alameda Harbor, with service at Richmond Ferry Terminal slated to begin in 2018. Hercules may also see future ferry service to San Francisco.

Bicycle transportation is strongly promoted by city and county agencies, and by organizations like the East Bay Bicycle Coalition.

Major pedestrian paths across the region include the San Francisco Bay Trail, the Bay Area Ridge Trail, the Ohlone Greenway, Iron Horse Regional Trail, Contra Costa Canal Trail, and the Richmond Greenway.

===Rail===
Rail service in the East Bay dates to the First transcontinental railroad, when the Western Pacific Railroad was contracted by the Central Pacific Railroad to provide the link between the Bay and Sacramento. This railroad eventually became the Niles Canyon Railway. Service to Alameda commenced in September 1869, four months after driving the golden spike at Promintory, Utah. Oakland Long Wharf eventually became the western terminus before ferry service to San Francisco. This road provided the sole link to the rest of the country until about 1879 when a more direct route across the Carquinez Strait was completed. Today, Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) operates commuter rail services through Niles Canyon to San Jose.

Streetcar service across the East Bay was historically provided by the Key System, incorporated in 1902 as the San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway. An amalgamation of several streetcar companies established in the late part of the century, the Key System provided interurban routes across Alameda county, with connections to San Francisco ferries via their private Key System Pier. Southern Pacific ran a competing system, East Bay Electric Lines, until they, too, had the Key System take over operations. When the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge opened in 1936, Key System cars could make the trip directly to the Transbay Terminal across the lower deck. Streetcars were replaced with busses in 1948 and transbay service halted in 1958. The system&#x27;s assets were sold to the newly formed AC Transit in 1960.

The East Bay&#x27;s modern rail transit service is Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, which was primarily designed to deliver commuters to San Francisco via the Transbay Tube, and to a lesser extent Oakland and Berkeley.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot; terminates in Emeryville, providing connections as far as Chicago, and further stations across the East Bay are served by Amtrak California&#x27;s &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; and &quot;San Joaquin&quot;.

==Economy==
The East Bay has a mixed economy of services, manufacturing, and small and large businesses. The region is headquarters to a number of highly notable businesses, including Kaiser Permanente, Chevron, and Safeway, among others. The East Bay Economic Development Alliance was founded by Alameda County as the Economic Development Advisory Board in 1990 as a public/private partnership with the mission to promote the East Bay as an important region for development, with Contra Costa County joining in 1996, and the current name chosen in 2006.

<text>John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos (9 March 1492 – 12 April 1557) was an English courtier, Member of Parliament and later peer. His last name is also sometimes spelt Brugge or Bruges. He was a prominent figure at the English court during the reigns of Kings Henry VIII and Edward VI and of Queen Mary I.

==Biography==
He was born at Coberley, Gloucestershire, the son of Sir Giles Brydges of Coberley (c. 1462 – 1511) and Isabel Baynham. His father was a knight of the body to Henry VII and his brother Thomas Brydges of Cornbury, Oxfordshire also held public office and served as an MP. Bridges inherited his father&#x27;s Oxfordshire and Wiltshire estates as a minor in 1511, and was for two years the ward of Sir Edward Darrell.

He was knighted in 1513 after serving in France with Charles Brandon at Terouenne and Tournai. He attended Henry VIII on all subsequent state occasions in England and France (presumably including the famous meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, where Gloucestershire was represented by, amongst others, a Sir John Brydges).

His election in 1529 as junior knight of the shire for Gloucestershire was a tribute to his standing both locally and at court, but it was doubtless assisted by his influential connections, through his mother with the Baynhams and through his wife with the noble house of Grey of Wilton.

Brydges was High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1537, and took part in suppressing the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt in 1554. As Lieutenant of the Tower of London during the earlier part of Queen Mary&#x27;s reign, he had the custody not only of Lady Jane Grey and of Thomas Wyatt, but for a short time, of the Queen&#x27;s half-sister as well, the Princess Elizabeth Tudor (who would later become Queen Elizabeth I of England).

In 1554, Queen Mary I gave Sudeley Castle to John Brydges and created him Baron Chandos of Sudeley on 8 April 1554. The castle remained his property throughout her reign and the reign of Queen Elizabeth I as well and then passed down to his descendants. It was at Sudeley Castle that Queen Elizabeth was entertained three times. Also, later on in 1592, a spectacular three-day feast was held there to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

==Family==
It was around 1512 when Brydges married Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edmund Grey, 9th Baron Grey de Wilton (died 1511), and Florence Hastings, eldest daughter of Sir Ralph Hastings. They had eleven children.

Their son Edmund succeeded to the Chandos barony on his father&#x27;s death.
Their son Charles married Jane, daughter of Sir Edward Carne. Their daughter Katherine became a gentlewoman to Mary I, and married Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley.

==Death==

He died at Sudeley Castle on 12 April 1557 and was buried with heraldic ceremony on 3 May in Sudeley Church. His will, dated 2 March 1556, was proved on 28 May 1557. In his will, he styles himself as Sir John Bruges, Knight, Lord Chandos of Sudeley.

Lady Chandos died on 29 December 1559 and was buried on 6 January 1560.

<text>Brij Mohan Kaul (1912–1972) was a Lieutenant General in the Indian Army. He served as the Chief of General Staff during 1961–1962 and was regarded as a key architect of Indian military response to the Chinese challenge.
In October 1962, he was given the command of a newly raised IV Corps to counter the impending Chinese invasion of NEFA (modern day Arunachal Pradesh), but it got routed by the Chinese.
He resigned in the aftermath of the war, and was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal in 1960.

==Personal life==
He was born on 1 May 1912, in a Kashmiri Pandit family to Gaura and Jagmohan Kaul in Lahore, Punjab, British India. His birth date coincided with Buddha Jayanti. He had a sister (Dulari), and a half-brother (Shyam) and a half-sister (Nanni). He married Dhanraj Kishori; they had two daughters Anuradha and Chitralekha.

==Career==
A King&#x27;s Commissioned Indian Officer, Kaul attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant on the Unattached List for the Indian Army on 31 August 1933. He then spent the next year attached to a British Army regiment in India, the 1st battalion East Surrey Regiment, starting 5 November 1933. After his years attachment accepted for the Indian Army and he was posted to the 5th Battalion, 6th Rajputana Rifles on 10 November 1934 with his date of commission as a Second Lieutenant antedated to 2 February 1933. He was promoted to Lieutenant 2 May 1935 but by mid-1936 he was attached away from the battalion to the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, a posting that led to a permanent transfer on 18 February 1937.

At the outbreak of World War Two he was serving with the 26th Mechanical Transport Company. He was promoted Captain 2 February 1941, acting Major 7 November 1942 and local Lieutenant-Colonel 14 December 1942, War Substantive Major &amp; temporary Lieutenant Colonel 19 February 1944 and Major 1 July 1946.

In October–December 1946, he was the secretary to &quot;Armed forces nationalisation committee&quot; constituted by Viceroy. Coincidentally, it was led by N Gopalawami Ayengar, later defense minister, with members including future Chief of Army Staff General Thimayya, future Pakistan Army chief Muhammad Musa and future Indian MP H.N. Kunzru.

In May 1947, Kaul was promoted local colonel and appointed as India&#x27;s defence attache in Washington. He returned to India in the aftermath of Indian Pakistan hostilities over Kashmir, and was promoted to acting brigadier in 1950 and to the substantive rank of colonel on 2 February 1951. On 15 January 1956, by now a brigadier, he was appointed an area commander in the acting rank of major-general.

In 1962, he was appointed as the commander of &quot;IV Corp&quot;s in the north eastern region of India.

===Operation Leghorn===
In 1962, Lt General B.M. Kaul was appointed as the General officer Commanding (GOC) the North east, replacing Lt General Umrao Singh. Kaul was to head the newly appointed IV Corps at Tezpur, however no new troops were sent to the corps with only the new headquarter staff being deployed there. The entire NEFA (North East Frontier Agency), now Arunachal Pradesh was made Kaul&#x27;s domain.

On his first day of assignment, Kaul flew to Lumpu and then trekked to Namkachu valley. He was the first General officer to visit the valley. Under his leadership, the Indian patrol occupied Tse Jong, a hillock north-west of the Chinese settlement. Kaul reportedly fell ill during the assignment and returned to New Delhi. The Indian patrol occupying Tse Jong was wiped out when an 800 strong enemy force raided the post subsequently.

The battle with China in 1962, in the NEFA, is also known as the &quot;Battle of Namkachu&quot;. The Battle of the Namakachu is used today to teach Indian Army officers on things to not do.

==Honours==
Kaul was the recipient of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal instituted by the Indian government in 1960, for his work in successfully completing the construction of quarters for troops in Ambala.

==Controversies==
In 1968, Brigadier John Dalvi, the former commanding officer of the 7th Infantry Brigade that participated in the 1962 Sino-Indian War authored a book named &quot;Himalayan Blunder&quot;, where he gave his first hand accounts and perceptions of the causes for India&#x27;s defeat in the war. He was critical of Lt General B.M. Kaul and attributed the loss in 1962 war partly to him. 
Excerpt from the book: &quot;He managed to keep himself away from hardship and learning the nuances of a military commander as a junior officer and later in service, managed to grab important Army senior command appointments due to his &quot;pull&quot;. His involvement with Jawaharlal Nehru later turned out to be a major reason for shameful loss and massacre of Indian troops at the hands of the Chinese&quot;.

In 1991, K. Satchidananda Murty wrote a biographical book about the second President of India, Shri Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, named &quot;Radhakrishnan: His Life and Ideas&quot;. In the book, he quoted the former president as having expressed doubts over the capability of Lt General B.M. Kaul.
Excerpt from the book: &quot;The General Officer was well known in the Army and Political Circles to be a &quot;personal favourite&quot; of Jawaharlal Nehru since his junior officer days. He reportedly received a number of undue professional favours throughout his career due to this personal connection and he made full use of this opportunity with utter disregard to the Army organisation&quot;.

In the book &quot;The Unfought War of 1962: An Appraisal&quot;, by Raghav Sharan Sharma, he has mentioned that Lt General B.M. Kaul was a distant relation of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. As a result, V.K.Krishna Menon who was the then Defence Minister and Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s close aide, appointed Lt General B.M. Kaul as Chief of General Staff, against the recommendation of the outgoing Chief of Army Staff, General K.S.Thimayya and in spite of the fact that he was an Army Service Corps officer, with no prior combat experience and having never commanded a fighting unit earlier.

Both the books have been highly critical about Lt General B.M. Kaul. However, Lt General Kaul also authored a book named &quot;The Untold Story&quot;, where he gave his version of reasons for the loss in the 1962 war.

==Books authored==
He wrote his side of the story about operation leghorn in the book &quot;The Untold Story&quot; and, in another book, &quot; Confrontation with Pakistan&quot;.

<text>Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos (10 August 1621) of Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, was an English nobleman and courtier.

==Early life==

He was the only son of William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos, who died on 18 November 1602, and Mary Hopton, who was daughter of Sir Owen Hopton. He was M.P. for Cricklade, in 1597.

Brydges and his family were friendly with Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. His father visited Essex at Essex House on the Sunday morning (8 February 1601) of Essex&#x27;s insurrection, but he was not deemed by the government to be implicated in the conspiracy. The son, Grey Brydges, was, however, suspected of immediate complicity, and was sent to the Fleet Prison with Henry Cuffe and others; but he was soon released.

==Courtier and grandee==

Grey Brydges succeeded his father as Baron Chandos in 1602, attended King James I of England&#x27;s initial parliament on 19 March 1604, and was made Knight of the Bath, when Prince Charles Stewart was created Duke of York in January 1605. He visited Oxford with King James I, and was granted the degree of M.A. on 30 August 1605. On 2 July 1609, he was appointed keeper of Ditton Park, Buckinghamshire, for life. He attended the funeral of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. Grey also took an active part in the court masques and tournaments. It was reported at court on 9 September 1613 that a duel was to be fought by him and the King&#x27;s favourite, Lord James Hay. He became Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire and was called the &quot;King of the Cotswolds&quot;, owing to his generosity and his magnificent style of living at his residence, Sudeley Castle.

==Traveller==
In 1608 he went travelling with Degory Wheare. In 1610 he was appointed one of the officers under Sir Edward Cecil in command of an expedition to the Low Countries, in the War of the Jülich succession. The Emperor Rudolph II&#x27;s forces were besieging Juliers, and the English had combined with Holland and France to protect the town. Sir Edward Herbert was Chandos&#x27;s companion through this campaign. Chandos lodged at Juliers with Sir Horace Vere, but does not seem to have taken much part in the fighting. Afterwards he attended Antoine de Pluvinel&#x27;s academy in Paris, and then went to Blois.

==Later life==

On 23 July 1612, Grey Brydges visited Spa in the Low Countries, for his health; he had been there before during the Jülich campaign. On 14 July 1616, there was some talk of making him President of Wales, and on 8 November 1617, he was appointed to receive ambassadors from Muscovy, then in England. His health was still failing, and after trying in 1618, the waters of Newenham Mills in Warwickshire, he returned to Spa, where he died suddenly on 10 August 1621, while taking in the waters there. His body was brought to Sudeley Castle, and buried there. An elegy for him was written by Sir John Beaumont.

==&quot;Horae Subsecivae&quot;==

Chandos has been regarded by Horace Walpole and others as the author of some essays, &quot;Horae Subsecivae&quot;. These were published by Edward Blount, and from topical references would appear to have been written about 1615. The attribution is moot: Michael Lort and Samuel Egerton Brydges supported Walpole&#x27;s view. Anthony à Wood and White Kennett had earlier stated that Gilbert Cavendish, eldest son of William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, was the author of the work. Copies are extant with the name of Lord Chandos inscribed on the title page in seventeenth-century handwriting.

Edmond Malone and Thomas Park, the editor of Walpole, attributed the book on the grounds of Gilbert&#x27;s age to William, a brother. A modern view agrees to the extent that 10 of the essays can be shown to have been written by William (for his father) in 1615, at a time when Thomas Hobbes was his tutor. (There is another view, which is that this collection is Hobbes&#x27;s own work.) The published essays come as 12 shorter pieces (the 10 by William being among those); and four longer ones, now attributed one to William (on flattery, based on a piece from 1611) and three to Hobbes.

==Family==

On 28 February 1607, he married Lady Anne Stanley, daughter of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby and Lady Alice Spencer. His wife Anne, a great-great-granddaughter of King Henry VIII&#x27;s sister, Princess Mary Tudor, had been heiress presumptive to the throne of England; she was, however, passed over for King James VI of Scotland.

The couple had the following five children:

* Robert Brydges (b. 1611), died young.
* Anne Brydges (b. 1612): she did marry, reputedly to a Mr Torteson but little is known about her later life and whether there were any issue. Issue has never been ruled out, there is little firm evidence about her life after childhood.
* Elizabeth Brydges (1619–1678), married her stepbrother, James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven.

<text>George Brydges, 6th Baron Chandos (1620–1655), was an English peer who supported Charles I in the English Civil War.

==Life==
He was born 9 August 1620, the elder son of Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos (c. 1580 – 10 August 1621) and Lady Anne Stanley. His mother was the great-granddaughter of King Henry VIII&#x27;s sister, Mary Tudor. Following his father&#x27;s unexpected death in 1621, which left his mother with four young children and a modest income, his mother married the recently widowed Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven. George spent much of his childhood in the care of his maternal grandmother Alice Spencer, Countess of Derby. Following his death, Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester became his guardian. In February 1638 he went abroad to finish his education.

According to his later account, on reaching 21 and the end of his wardship he had an estate worth £3,120 per annum. His actual income was significantly reduced by the need to provide annuities for his mother and younger brother.

Through his possession of Sudeley Castle George was an important landowner in Gloucestershire, although his youth meant that he had not established himself as a political force. At the outbreak of the Civil War he received a Commission of array from the king. His attempt to execute this in Cirencester met with considerable opposition and he had to flee from the town. Rather than remain at Sudeley, a strategic stronghold, he went with men and plate to join the king, but remained an important figure in the royalist administration of the county. He subsequently distinguished himself at the first Battle of Newbury in 1643. However, following his failure to be appointed colonel-general by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1644 after the failure of the siege despite support from the Court, &#x27;out of pure weariness of the fatigue&#x27; he went to London to seek a composition with parliament. By petitioning to compound then, his eventual fine was only for a tenth of his estate rather than a third.

In 1649, after the end of the civil war, Parliament ordered the slighting of Sudeley Castle, to ensure that it could never again be used as a military post. In 1650, he received some financial compensation for the loss of the castle but not enough for reconstruction. The castle remained semi-derelict. On the death of his mother in 1647, Lord Chandos had inherited Harefield Place, Middlesex. Two daughters were baptised at Harefield in 1650 and 1651 and his wife was buried there in 1652.

In 1651 he corresponded with Charles II, raising hopes that he would again act as a royalist leader in Gloucestershire. He was arrested in April 1651, but although bailed he fled abroad in May 1652 after killing Colonel Henry Compton, son of Sir Henry Compton in one of the first recorded duels at Putney. He returned the following year and was convicted of manslaughter and burned in the hand &#x27;a strange doom for a nobleman&#x27;. 

On 6 February 1655, he died of smallpox at his house in Covent Garden, and was buried at Sudeley. As he had a number of daughters but no male heir, he was succeeded by his younger brother William

==Family==
He married twice:

1. Lady Susan Montagu (d. 1652), daughter of his guardian Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester

2. Lady Jane Savage, daughter of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers. 
She was left a substantial estate by her husband, including his Gloucestershire estates and the manor of Haresfield. She subsequently married Sir William Sedley and George Pitt.

<text>Irish linen () is the name given to linen produced in Ireland (including both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland). Linen is cloth woven from, or yarn spun from, flax fibre, which was grown in Ireland for many years before advanced agricultural methods and more suitable climate led to the concentration of quality flax cultivation in northern Europe.

== Production ==

Most of the world crop of quality flax is now grown in northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Since about the 1950s to 1960s, the flax fibre for Irish linen yarn has been imported almost exclusively from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It is bought by spinners who produce yarn, which is then sold to weavers (or knitters) who produce fabric. Irish linen spinning has now virtually ceased, yarns being imported from places such as the eastern part of the European Union and China. 

Weaving today consists mainly of plain linens for niche, top-of-the-range, apparel uses. Linen damask weaving in Ireland has less capacity, and it is confined at very much the top end of the market for luxury end-uses. Companies who continue to weave in Ireland, including Thomas Ferguson &amp; Co Ltd, tend to concentrate on the quality end of the market, and Jacquard weaving is moving towards the weaving of special and custom damask pieces, made to the customer&#x27;s specific requirements. Fabric woven outside of Ireland and then brought to Ireland to be bleached or dyed and finished cannot carry the Irish Linen Guild logo, which is the Guild trademark, and signifies the genuine Irish Linen brand.

== Definition ==

The Irish Linen Guild has defined Irish linen as yarn which is spun in Ireland from 100% flax fibres. It is not required that every stage from the growing of the flax to the weaving must take place in Ireland. To be Irish linen fabric, the yarns do not necessarily have to come from an Irish spinner; to be Irish linen (yarn), the flax fibre does not have to be grown in Ireland. However, the skills, craftsmanship, and technology that go into spinning the yarn must be Irish – as is the case with Irish linen fabric, where the design and weaving skills must be Irish. Finished garments or household textile items can be labelled Irish linen, although they may have been made up in another country. Irish linen does not refer to the making-up process (such as cutting and sewing).

<text>William Weber (May 8, 1957 – December 13, 2024) was an American television sports commentator best known for his work on TNT and NBC NASCAR broadcasts. Weber was also the lead announcer for Champ Car World Series events and other auto racing series on NBC and worked as an illusionist in St. Petersburg, Florida.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Weber was born in Middletown, New Jersey. He was born the second-eldest of four children, 2 boys and 2 girls. His career began at WISH-TV in Indianapolis as a sports reporter while a student at Butler University. After graduating in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in radio and television and a minor in journalism, Weber served as sports director at stations in Terre Haute, Indiana and Evansville, Indiana.

In 1987, Weber left television to work on the Miller Brewing Company&#x27;s Unlimited Hydroplane Racing program as a media relations consultant. He then returned to Evansville and radio. In 1990, he relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina to work for a Sunbelt Video, a production company, which has since been purchased by NASCAR and is known as NASCAR Digital Media.

Weber spent time working for TNN as part of the &quot;Inside NASCAR&quot;.

===ESPN===
Weber signed on with the ESPN and ESPN2 cable networks (and later with ABC) in 1994 as a pit-road reporter, and as a contributing reporter on &quot;RPM 2Night&quot; from 1996 until 2000.

===NBC Sports and TNT Sports===
In 2001, Weber was tapped as pre-race host and pit reporter for NBC and TNT&#x27;s coverage of NASCAR. For part of the 2004 season, Weber replaced Allen Bestwick as lap-by-lap announcer when Bestwick broke his leg during a charity ice hockey game in Rhode Island. On December 14, 2004, this switch was made permanent after weeks of rumors.

Prior to broadcasting NASCAR races, Weber had play-by-play experience. He was one of NBC&#x27;s play-by-play announcers for its regional coverage of the Arena Football League.

On July 30, 2006, TNT announced that Bill Weber would continue as voice of &quot;NASCAR on TNT&quot; even after contracts with NBC come to an end at the conclusion of the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series season.

The NBC and TNT partnership continued with Weber hosting coverage of the North American International Auto Show for NBC, and both Weber and Dallenbach assigned to NBC&#x27;s Champ Car World Series events in April 2007. The pair also called NBC&#x27;s American Le Mans Series races.

Weber and commentators Wally Dallenbach Jr. and Benny Parsons made cameo appearances as themselves in the 2006 Will Ferrell NASCAR comedy &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;.

In 2009, while in New Hampshire to cover the NASCAR Sprint Cup race, Weber was suspended by TNT and was not allowed to call the race or appear on the air. TNT senior vice president Sal Petruzzi stated: “As this is a private issue, it’s the policy of the company not to discuss personal matters involving our employees.” Other reports indicated that Weber got into a loud confrontation in his hotel lobby regarding complaints about his hotel room. On July 1, 2009, TNT and NASCAR announced that Weber would be replaced by Ralph Sheheen for the final two races of TNT&#x27;s 2009 schedule.

==Notable calls==
Weber was on the call for several notable races as lap-by-lap announcer. His only Daytona 500 call was in 2006, when Jimmie Johnson won his first Daytona 500. Later that season, Weber also called Johnson&#x27;s first Cup Series championship at the Ford 400, the first of five consecutive titles for Johnson. Weber also called the July Daytona race in 2005, 2007, and 2008.

==Later life and death==
Following his dismissal from TNT, Weber worked as an illusionist at a hotel in St. Petersburg, Florida.

His voice was heard on a commercial for Acorn Stairlifts and driver James Jakes during IndyCar Series races in April 2014.

Weber died on December 13, 2024, at the age of 67. He was survived by his wife of 24 years, Teresa.

<text>Air Chief Marshal Swaroop Krishna Kaul, PVSM, MVC, ADC (born 20 December 1935) is a former Chief of the Air Staff of the Indian Air Force. Kaul served as the Air Chief from 1993 to 1995.

== Personal life ==
Swaroop Krishna Kaul was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, into a Kashmiri Pandit family, to K K Kaul. He did his schooling from Besant college in Varanasi and his graduation from Government College, Allahabad in 1951.

== Career ==

Kaul joined the National Defence Academy in 1951 and was commissioned in the IAF on 17 July 1954 

During the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, as a Wing Commander Kaul led several missions into the Pakistani held areas of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to photograph strategically vital areas.

As Commanding Officer of 37 Squadron, he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, the second highest war-time military decoration in India.

After Commanding the Central Air Command and the Western Air Command, Kaul took over as the 16th Chief of the Air Staff of the Indian Air Force.

In November 1994, Kaul was appointed as the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. He retired from the Air Force in December 1995. He had over 3,700 hours of accident free flying to his credit.

== Awards ==
Kaul was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra for a show of conspicuous gallantry during the 1971 war and the Param Vishisht Seva Medal in 1992.

(Effective date of award – 4 December 1971)

&quot;At the outbreak of hostilities, Wing Commander Swaroop Krishna Kaul, the Commanding Officer of a fighter bomber squadron volunteered for an urgent task to photograph certain areas which were badly needed in order to finalise our Army’s assault plans. The officer carried out four missions deep into enemy territories to cover the heavily defended sectors of Comilla, Sylhet and Saidpur. At times, Wing Commander Kaul had to fly as low as 200 feet over the most heavily defended enemy locations. Undaunted, he flew through these barrages, making repeated runs in each of his missions, and successfully completed the task. On 4th December, 1971, Wing Commander Kaul again volunteered for another task, to photograph the Tezgaon and Kurmitola airfields. His reconnaissance flights over these two airfields, in the face of the most sustained and heavy enemy ground fire stand out as acts of heroism, extreme gallantry and devotion to duty. In addition to his reconnaissance exploits, Wing Commander Kaul led the very first eight aircraft strike mission over Dacca. In this raid, his formation encountered four enemy aircraft near the target area. With exemplary leadership, Wing Commander Kaul maneuvered his force in such a manner that two of the enemy aircraft were shot down and the other two fled. The target thus became clear for attack. Throughout the period of operations Wing Commander Swaroop Krishna Kaul displayed conspicuous gallantry, determination and professional skill.&quot;

<doc id="1307189" wikidata="Q158775" url="?curid=1307189" title="Mezen, Mezensky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast">
<text>Mezen () is a town and the administrative center of Mezensky District in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, located on the right bank of the Mezen River close to the point where it flows into the White Sea. Population: 

==History==
The settlement at the location of the present-day Mezen was founded in the 16th century and was known as Okladnikova Sloboda (). It was subsequently developed into the trading center of the Mezen River valley where annual trade fairs were held. Besides the trade, the main occupations of the Mezen inhabitants were fishery and seal hunting. In 1780, Okladnikova Sloboda was merged with the nearby settlement of Kuznetsovskaya Sloboda into the town of Mezen. In 1784, Mezen became the seat of Mezensky Uyezd of Vologda Viceroyalty. In 1796, the territory was transferred to Arkhangelsk Governorate. In 1929, several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished and Mezen became the administrative center of Mezensky District.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Mezen serves as the administrative center of Mezensky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with the village of Semzha, incorporated within Mezensky District as the town of district significance of Mezen. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Mezen, together with the territory of Lampozhensky Selsoviet (which comprises four rural localities) in Mezensky District, are incorporated within Mezensky Municipal District as Mezenskoye Urban Settlement.

==Restricted access==
The northern part of Mezensky District, including Mezen itself, is included into the border security zone, intended to protect the borders of Russia from unwanted activity. In order to visit Mezen, a permit issued by the local Federal Security Service department is required.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Economic activity in Mezen is currently limited to food industry and mechanical works. The Mezen sawmill and the Mezen sea harbor are both located in Kamenka across the Mezen River.

===Transportation===
The Mezen River is navigable; however, there is no passenger navigation in Mezen except for the ferry boat to Kamenka. There is an all-season road to Arkhangelsk (which crosses the Mezen near the village of Kimzha), completed in 2008. During winter, temporary roads (&quot;zimniks&quot;) are built in snow.

Mezen is served by the Mezen Airport, with several weekly flights to Arkhangelsk.

==Culture and recreation==
Mezen is one of the few former uyezd towns which generally preserved the historical center. There are many former merchant houses, mostly made of wood, in the town center.

Mezen hosts the Mezen Regional Museum.

A carved epitaph was found in 1957 on a nameless island in the White Sea, done by brothers Ivan and Ondriyan, fishermen from Mezen, who apparently got to the island after the shipwreck and lost any hope to be found again. The epitaph was featured in &quot;Laughter and Grief by the White Sea&quot;, a 1987 Soviet traditionally animated feature film directed by Leonid Nosyrev made at the Soyuzmultfilm studio.

==Climate==

Mezen has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long winters and short summers.

<doc id="1307208" wikidata="Q333238" url="?curid=1307208" title="James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos">
<text>James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, (6 January 16739 August 1744) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1698 until 1714, when he succeeded to the peerage as Baron Chandos, and vacated his seat in the House of Commons to sit in the House of Lords. He was subsequently created [[Earl of Carnarvon]], and then Duke of Chandos in 1719.

==Early life==

Brydges was born on the 6 January 1673 at Dewsall, Herefordshire, the fourth, but eldest surviving son of James Brydges, 8th Baron Chandos and his wife Elizabeth Barnard, daughter of Sir Henry Barnard, merchant of St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and of Bridgnorth, Shropshire. He was educated at Westminster School in 1686, and at New College, Oxford, from 1690 to 1692. He was at the Wolfenbüttel academy from 1692 to 1694 and in 1694 he was elected to the Royal Society.

== Political career==
Brydges was a Freeman of Ludlow in 1697, and was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Hereford at the 1698 English general election. In 1700 he was a member of the Old East India Company. He was returned as MP for Hereford in contests at the two general elections of 1701 and unopposed at the 1702 English general election. From 1702 to 1703 he was Commissioner of public accounts and was a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral from 1703 to April 1705. He was returned unopposed at Hereford again at the 1705 English general election. From April 1705 Brydges was paymaster-general of the forces abroad during the War of the Spanish Succession. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned for Truro, and in a contest for Hereford, and opted to sit at Hereford. In 1710 he was admitted to the Inner Temple. He was returned in a contest for Hereford at the 1710 British general election. In 1711 he was a commissioner for taking subscriptions to the South Sea Company. He was returned unopposed at the 1713 British general election.

Brydges succeeded his father as 9th Baron Chandos on 16 October 1714, and was created Earl of Carnarvon on 19 October 1714. He took up the role of joint clerk of hanaper in reversion in November 1714. In 1718 he became governor of the Levant Company until 1736. He was created Duke of Chandos on 29 April 1719. In 1721 he became a governor of Charterhouse. He was Lord Lieutenant of the counties of Hereford and Radnor and steward of crown manors for Radnorshire. He became a member of the Privy Council on 11 November 1721. He was Chancellor of the University of St Andrews (where he established the &quot;Chandos Chair of Medicine and Anatomy&quot; in 1721) from 1724 for the rest of his life. In 1737 he was appointed ranger of Enfield chase 1737. He became one of the founding governors of the Foundling Hospital in 1739.

==Wealth==
Brydges amassed great wealth through his public offices. The ethics of his financial operations were called into question at the time, but it was generally accepted that people could profit from public office. He continued to engage in speculative investments after being made Duke of Chandos in 1719, but lost money in the South Sea Bubble and the York Buildings Company.

Brydges built a magnificent house &quot;at vast expense&quot; at Cannons, an estate near Edgware in Middlesex. There he ran through several architects prominent in the English Baroque. He began in 1713 with William Talman, whom he dismissed in favour of John James in 1714; James had partly executed his designs before James Gibbs succeeded him in 1715. Howard Colvin (ref) concludes that the south and east elevations, as well as the chapel, were the designs of Gibbs. Brydges dismissed Gibbs in 1719, and completed the house under the supervision of John Price and, in 1723–25, Edward Shepherd. Cannons was demolished in 1747. On its site, now incorporated in Greater London, is Canons Park.

Brydges is said to have considered building a private road across his own lands between this place and his never completed house in Cavendish Square, London, probably also designed by Gibbs.

==Handel and Pope==

The Duke is chiefly remembered on account of his connections with George Frideric Handel, for whom he acted as a major patron, and with Alexander Pope, seen as having slandered Chandos in one of his poems. He served as an early patron to his relative George Rodney, later to become famous for his victory at the Battle of the Saintes, during his early career in the navy.

===Chandos and Handel===
Before Chandos was made a duke, he employed the young composer George Frideric Handel over a period of two years, 1717–18. Handel lived at Cannons, where he composed his oratorio &quot;Esther&quot; and his pastoral opera &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;. Handel also composed the &quot;Chandos Anthems&quot; for his patron; they were first performed at the parish church of St Lawrence, Little Stanmore, with the composer playing the organ of 1716 which has survived there to the present day.

In 1719 Chandos was one of the main subscribers in the Royal Academy of Music, not the currently well-known conservatoire of that name but a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage in London.

===Chandos and Pope===
Alexander Pope, who in one of his Moral Essays (the Epistle to Burlington) was alleged to have ridiculed Cannons under the guise of Timon&#x27;s Villa, later referred to the Duke in the line, &quot;Thus gracious Chandos is belov&#x27;d at sight&quot;; but Jonathan Swift, less complimentary, called him &quot;a great with every court&quot;. The poet was caricatured by Hogarth for his supposed servility to Chandos. Pope published a denial of his alleged satire of the Duke&#x27;s estate, in which he said that the estate of the poem &quot;differs in every particular from&quot; Chandos&#x27;s. According to Pope’s biographer Maynard Mack, Chandos thereafter assured Pope by letter that he believed him, i.e. that the Epistle to Burlington was not intended as a satire of his estate. The malice, indeed, was on the part not of Pope, but of the insinuators and slanderers, the hack writers whom Pope had ridiculed as dunces in his &quot;Dunciad&quot;; Mack calls the affair a &quot;falsehood of considerable damage to [Pope&#x27;s] character&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==
Chandos was married three times. On 2 February 1695, he married Mary Lake, daughter of Sir Thomas Lake, of Cannons, Middlesex and his wife Rebecca Langham.

The marriage produced two sons who survived childhood:
# John Brydges, Marquess of Carnarvon (15 January 17038 April 1727)
# Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos (1 February 170828 November 1771).

His first wife Mary died on 15 September 1712. He then married Cassandra Willoughby of Wollaton Hall, the daughter of Francis Willoughby and Emma Barnard on 4 August 1713.

His second wife Cassandra died on 18 July 1735. On 18 April 1736, he married Lydia Catherine Van Hatten, the daughter of John Van Hatten and Lydia Davall.

==Death and legacy==
Chandos died in Cannons on 9 August 1744. Chandos and several members of his family (his first two wives) are buried at the Chandos Mausoleum at the Church of St Lawrence, Whitchurch Lane, Little Stanmore, London. His third wife, who survived him, moved to Shaw House, Berkshire where she died in 1750.

Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu in a letter, dated Sandleford, 21 December 1750 to Miss Anstey, wrote: &quot;My dear Miss Anstey, ... A little before I went to London I lost my very good neighbour, the Dutchess of Chandos, a stroke of the palsy carried her off in a few days: her bodily pains were great, but her mind felt the serenity that gilds the evening of a virtuous life. She quitted the world with that decent fare-well which people take of it, who rather consider it as a place in which they are to impart good than to enjoy it Her character has made a great impression on me, as I think her a rare instance that age could not make conceited and stiff, nor retirement discontented, nor virtue inflexible and severe...&quot;

In a letter to Mrs. Donnellan dated Sandleford, 30 December 1750, Mrs. Montagu continued, &quot;My rich neighbours are dull, and my poor ones are miserable ... The Dutchess of Chandos is greatly missed by the poor in this rigorous season. There is a family at Donnington Castle who are very generous and charitable, but nothing can entirely avail in a part of the world where manufacture decays; daily labour must give daily bread; occasional alms like medicine to the diseased, but can hardly procure constant health. To make the poor happy one must make them industrious...&quot;

=== Succession ===
Chandos was succeeded by his son, Henry Brydges, 2nd Duke of Chandos, who found the estate so encumbered by debt that a demolition sale of Cannons was held in 1747, which dispersed furnishings and structural elements, with the result that elements of Cannons survive in several English country houses, notably Lord Foley&#x27;s house, Witley Court at Great Witley, with its chapel (ceiling paintings by Bellucci and stained glass by Joshua Price of York after designs by Francesco Sleter). The pulpit and other fittings from Chandos&#x27;s chapel were reinstalled in the parish church at Fawley, Buckinghamshire, by John Freeman of Fawley Court.

The 1st Duke&#x27;s sister, The Hon. Mary Brydges, married Theophilus Leigh. They were the great-grandparents of Jane Austen.

<doc id="1307216" wikidata="Q7156869" url="?curid=1307216" title="Payolas">
<text>Payolas (stylized as Payola$) was a Canadian rock band that was most prominent in the 1980s. Evolving from a new wave sound toward mainstream pop rock, they were best known for the single &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot;, from their 1982 album &quot;No Stranger to Danger&quot;, an album that won the band four Juno Awards.

Based in Vancouver, the band had experienced several changes to both its name and lineup, having been known as The Payola$, Paul Hyde and the Payolas, and Rock and Hyde. Vocalist and lyricist Paul Hyde and multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and producer Bob Rock were the band&#x27;s core members throughout its history. The band broke up in 1988, but reformed again from 2003 to 2008.

==Band history==

===Name===
The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the United States payola scandal of the early 1960s, which was a pay-for-play scheme involving commercial radio stations. The name caused issues with A&amp;M record executives who wanted to introduce the band to the American market and who were concerned about the term&#x27;s negative connotations, which resulted in the band&#x27;s name change to Paul Hyde and the Payola$ in 1985.

Rock told &quot;The Province&quot; in 2003 that their band&#x27;s name caused one record executive to tell him &quot;I won&#x27;t lift a finger to help you.&quot; Rock added that it was Hyde that came up with the name and that &quot;I was the idiot who put the dollar sign at the end.&quot;

===Early years (1978–1981)===
Paul Hyde, originally from Yorkshire, England, emigrated to Victoria, British Columbia at age fifteen. Hyde met Bob Rock while the pair were attending Belmont High School in Langford, a Victoria suburb. Rock, who moved to Victoria from Winnipeg at age twelve, described his first encounter with Hyde to the &quot;Times Colonist&quot; in 2007: &quot;He had his hair all cut off, and later I found out it was because he wanted to look like a skinhead when he immigrated to Canada so he wouldn&#x27;t get beat up. Being such a fan of English culture and bands, I saw this kid standing there in a long trenchcoat and shaved head and I went, &#x27;That&#x27;s a guy I wanna know.&#x27;&quot;

Influenced by musical artists such as David Bowie, Slade, T. Rex, Alex Harvey and Be-Bop Deluxe, the pair formed the Paul Kane Blues Band and toured Vancouver Island in the mid-1970s. In 1976, Rock landed a job as an apprentice recording engineer at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver and became acquainted with Vancouver&#x27;s punk scene. Rock and Hyde were joined by drummer Ian Tiles (of Pointed Sticks) and bass player Marty Higgs to form the pop-punk band Payola$. At the time, Rock was producing mainly punk acts, such as the Young Canadians, The Dils and the Pointed Sticks.

In 1979, Payola$ released their first single &quot;China Boys&quot; on their own Slophouse label. The song, whose lyrics reference the westernization of China, attracted the attention of A&amp;M Records. Higgs and Tiles left shortly after the single was recorded and were replaced by drummer Taylor Nelson Little and sax/bass player Gary Middleclass (&quot;né&quot; Bourgeois). The four track EP &quot;Introducing Payola$&quot; was released by A&amp;M in 1980. Middleclass left in 1980 (later becoming a teacher at the Vancouver Film School sound design program); he was replaced by Lawrence Wilkins on bass. Lee Kelsey was added on keyboards. This quintet recorded 1981&#x27;s &quot;In a Place Like This&quot;, first at Little Mountain studios, then completed at the famed Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec. The album&#x27;s sound contained both reggae and ska influences. Produced by Rock, &quot;In a Place Like This&quot; was a critical success, but didn&#x27;t do well commercially.

===Work with Mick Ronson (1982–1984)===
In 1982, Chris Taylor was added to the band lineup; he replaced Taylor Little on drums. Kelsey left the band as well. This line-up recorded the album &quot;No Stranger to Danger&quot;, with famed English musician, songwriter and producer Mick Ronson acting as the album&#x27;s producer. Ronson first heard of the Payolas when they were looking for a producer for &quot;In a Place Like This&quot;, but was unable to produce the album due to scheduling conflicts.

Incorporating elements of reggae, dub, pop, punk, and new wave, &quot;No Stranger to Danger&quot; included the hit single &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot;, which won the Juno Award for best single. Junos were also given to Rock and Hyde for their songwriting, Rock was awarded Recording Engineer of the Year, and the band as a whole won the Most Promising Group.

The band toured with New Zealand new wave band Split Enz on the Canadian leg of their 1982 tour. Ronson joined the Payola$ on stage on keyboards. In the 2011 book, &quot;Have Not Been The Same; The CanRock Renaissance 1985-1995&quot;, Rock said: &quot;The funniest things was that after we played the first date, all the guys in Split Enz were on stage going, &#x27;Is that Mick Ronson? Who&#x27;s this band?&#x27;&quot; After the album had been issued, Wilkins left the group; Barry Muir filled in on bass, but as a sessioneer, not a group member. Christopher Livingston was added on keyboards as a full new group member.

Ronson produced the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Hammer on a Drum&quot;, released in 1984. The album included the single &quot;Never Said I Loved You&quot; featuring Carole Pope, vocalist of rock band Rough Trade, which reached No. 8 in Canada.

===Work with David Foster (1985–1986)===
In 1985, producer and songwriter David Foster helped assemble the supergroup Northern Lights to record the song &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;. Hyde was one of over 50 musicians featured on the song and Rock served as one of the engineers. Rock and Hyde came up with the song&#x27;s title and contributed to the French lyrics along with Rachel Paiement.

That same year, A&amp;M Records recruited Foster to produce the band&#x27;s next recording, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s the World for Ya&quot;, with the hopes of bringing the band to the American market. The band&#x27;s name was also changed to Paul Hyde and the Payola$. By this point, the band consisted of Hyde, Rock, drummer Chris Taylor and bassist Alex &quot;A-Train&quot; Boynton. Both Foster and Hyde&#x27;s then-wife, Myriam Nelson, contributed some of the songwriting. &quot;Here&#x27;s the World for Ya&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track garnered six Juno Award nominations, including best group, album as well as best vocalist for Hyde, best sound engineer for Rock and songwriter of the year for both Rock and Hyde. The single, &quot;You&#x27;re the Only Love&quot; charted in the US, peaking at No. 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart—the first Payola$ single to do so.

The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound that alienated many of their longtime fans as a result. In 1987, Tim O&#x27;Connor of Canadian Press said that the album &quot;was glossy and tight, but it wasn&#x27;t the Payola$.&quot; In that same article Hyde said, &quot;We compromised ourselves somewhat artistically,&quot; adding &quot;We were untrue to ourselves and our fans.&quot; Rock said of the experience, &quot;We learned a lot from him, he&#x27;s a very good musician. We saw a complete other side of recording with David. It was very polished and professional,&quot; adding &quot;The thing with David (Foster) is that it swung far too much his way.&quot;

Despite the critical success, the album did not sell as well as hoped and the band was dropped by A&amp;M in 1986.

=== Rock and Hyde (1987) ===
In 1987, the band rebranded themselves as Rock and Hyde and released &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; on Capitol/EMI. The album marked a return to the politically and socially conscious lyrics of the Payolas&#x27; early work, with Rock also handling the sound engineering. The Rock and Hyde sound was more pop-oriented than that of the Payolas. &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; reached No. 24 on the top 100 album chart in Canada.

&quot;Under the Volcano&quot; was critically well-received, and Rock and Hyde had two hits in Canada with &quot;Dirty Water&quot; (No. 20) and &quot;I Will&quot; (No. 40). &quot;Dirty Water&quot; also peaked on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at No. 61.

Later that same year A&amp;M capitalized on the band&#x27;s renewed popularity and released a greatest hits package of Payolas work called &quot;Between a Rock and a Hyde Place: The Best of Payola$&quot;.

=== Hiatus (1988–2003) ===
After the release of &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;, Rock returned his focus to sound engineering and producing music from Little Mountain studios and became a go-to producer for hard rock and metal acts, producing albums for musical acts such as Loverboy, The Cult, Mötley Crüe, Metallica, Bon Jovi, and David Lee Roth. Along with ex-Payola$ drummer Chris Taylor, he was also involved in the band Rockhead that released an album in 1992.

The Payola$ reformed for a one-time gig on October 26, 1994, with Rock, Hyde, Boynton and new members Matt Frenette (drums) and Richard Sera (keyboards). Rock and Hyde then again went their separate ways. Paul Hyde pursued a solo recording career, releasing four albums between 1999 and 2002. These releases include 2000&#x27;s &quot;Living off the Radar&quot;. &quot;Living off the Radar&quot; is a Payola$ album in all but name as it featured Rock as the album&#x27;s producer, mixer, and guitarist; he was also the co-writer of several tracks. (Chris Taylor and Alex Boynton also played on a few tracks.)

&quot;The Best of the Payola$, 20th Century Masters, The Millennium Collection&quot; was released in 2002 in Universal Music&#x27;s 20th Century Masters Series. The compilation included the Rock and Hyde track &quot;Dirty Water&quot;.

=== Reunion (2003–2008) ===
Rock and Hyde played live in Vancouver in 2003, reformed as The Payolas. An EP called &quot;Missing Links&quot; was released for a charitable foundation, consisting of previously unreleased Payola$ songs and demos, a couple of which had surfaced earlier, in slightly different productions, on Paul Hyde&#x27;s solo album &quot;Living off the Radar&quot;.

In 2006, they reunited once more; further, on July 17, 2007, the Payola$ released a seven-song EP, &quot;Langford (Part One)&quot;. It was announced that there would be a full-length follow-up to the &quot;Langford (Part One)&quot; EP, possibly incorporating some of the EP&#x27;s tracks, however this release never materialized.

The band stopped performing live as of 2008, and the official Payolas website shut down in 2009. As with the band&#x27;s first break-up, no formal announcement was made that the Payola$ were ceasing operations; however, later in 2009 Paul Hyde resumed his solo career, releasing his fifth studio album. In a 2020 interview with the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, Hyde said that he hadn&#x27;t performed live music in five years and had changed his focus towards visual art. However, in a 2023 podcast interview, Hyde revealed that he and Rock had been working on a covers album, for release at an indefinite future time. Whether this newly recorded material would be issued under the Payola$ name, or as Rock and Hyde, or perhaps using some other guise, was not revealed.

<doc id="1307217" wikidata="Q7608962" url="?curid=1307217" title="Stephen Courtauld">
<text>Sir Stephen Lewis Courtauld (27 February 1883 – 9 October 1967) was an English philanthropist associated with geographical exploration, the restoration of Eltham Palace in south-east London, and cultural and education causes, both in the UK and in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he and his wife Virginia also donated to organisations promoting racial equality.

==Family, education and military service==
Courtauld was a member of the wealthy English Courtauld textile family. He was born in Bocking, Essex, the son of Sydney Courtauld (10 March 1840 – 20 October 1899) and Sarah Lucy Sharpe (1844–1906) and youngest brother of Samuel Courtauld, founder of the Courtauld Institute of Art. He was educated at Rugby and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He did not enter the family business but his wealthy background enabled him to travel extensively and to pursue cultural and philanthropic interests.

Serving in the Artists&#x27; Rifles, Worcestershire Regiment and the Machine Gun Corps during World War I, he was twice mentioned in despatches and awarded the Military Cross in 1918. After the war, in 1919, as an enthusiastic mountaineer, he completed the first ascent of the Innominata face of Mont Blanc in the French Alps. Also in 1919, he met his future wife, Countess Virginia Spinola (&quot;née&quot; Peirano) (c. 1883–1972), whom he married on 20 August 1923 at Fiume (then in Italy, now Rijeka, Croatia). In the month of their marriage artist Percy Metcalfe was commissioned to strike medals featuring busts of the couple and these are now held in the British Museum collection.

==Philanthropic work==
Courtauld became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1920. He later became a member of the Council and was Vice President of the Society (1944–1946). He was chairman of the committee to raise the necessary funds to equip the British Arctic Air Route Expedition (1930–1931), led by Gino Watkins. Courtauld&#x27;s first cousin Augustine Courtauld was a member both of the committee and of the expedition.

He funded construction of an ice rink in Westminster, the London Ice Club, which opened on 13 January 1927. World War II forced the club&#x27;s closure in 1940.

Courtauld collaborated with Basil Dean and Reginald Baker and made a substantial financial contribution to the construction and development of Ealing Studios. At the opening of two large sound stages in December 1931, providing facilities for 12 film productions a year, the ribbon-cutting ceremony was performed jointly by Virginia Courtauld and actress Gracie Fields. Courtauld was subsequently chairman of the Ealing Studios group of companies for 20 years and was instrumental in the appointment of Michael Balcon to take charge of the production programme in 1938. He was a trustee of the Royal Opera House in London&#x27;s Covent Garden, and provided financial support for the Courtauld Galleries in Cambridge&#x27;s Fitzwilliam Museum. He funded a Scholarship for the Art of Engraving at the British School at Rome.
He undertook the redevelopment of Eltham Palace in Eltham, south-east London with his wife Virginia during the 1930s. They employed architects John Seely and Paul Paget and fashionable Mayfair interior designer the Marchese Peter Malacrida (1889–1980) to design a new private house in the Art Deco style to adjoin the existing Palace building, which was extensively restored. Malacrida also designed the interiors of the Courtauld&#x27;s 712-ton luxury yacht, &quot;Virginia&quot; (launched in 1930 at Dalmuir on the Upper Clyde in Scotland).

Later in the Second World War, the Courtaulds left Eltham Palace in May 1944 to live in Muckairn, Taynuilt, Scotland, as the site was on one of the Luftwaffe bombing paths towards London and was subjected to some direct hits.

==The Rhodesia years==
In 1951, they moved again, to Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. They established a home at Penhalonga, near Mutare. The estate was named La Rochelle after the place of origin of his family. There they established an extensive botanic garden designed by an Italian landscape artist. The &quot;Lady Virginia Orchid&quot; is named after Lady Courtauld. The couple became Rhodesian citizens on 16 June 1954.

Courtauld was a very active philanthropist in Southern Rhodesia. His achievements included the funding of the construction of buildings for the Courtauld Theatre and Queen&#x27;s Hall in Mutare. An obituary noted that &quot;liberal in thought and open minded in his relations with people, it is said that when the question arose of racial segregation in his theatre he made it clear he would pull the building down before agreeing to such a measure.&quot; Stephen and Virginia Courtauld were leading donors to the Capricorn Africa Society, led by David Stirling, which promoted democratic and multi-racial development in East and Central Africa. He built a multi-racial residential club, the Rhodes Club (1961), in Mutare, and founded and endowed the Kukwanisa Farm School in Nyanga for African boys in 1964.

Stephen Courtauld was chairman of the board of trustees of the Rhodes National Gallery (now the National Gallery of Zimbabwe), which opened in 1957. An enthusiastic supporter, he contributed to the construction costs and provided a substantial endowment fund for the Gallery. He bequeathed 93 works of art to the gallery, including works by Rembrandt, Goya, Hogarth and Pissarro. These works are not on display in the gallery and their whereabouts has been described as a &quot;mystery.&quot; He also funded construction of the auditorium of what is now the Zimbabwe College of Music in Harare.

He was knighted in the 1958 New Year Honours.

Sir Stephen died in Salisbury in 1967, following the amputation of his second leg. Virginia moved to Jersey in 1970 where she died in 1972. The La Rochelle estate was bequeathed to the National Trust of Rhodesia (now the National Trust of Zimbabwe) in 1970.

<text>Prithivi Nath Kaul Bamzai (1910–2007) was a Kashmiri scholar and historian who wrote several books on the history of Kashmir and Central Asia.

==Works==
P. N. K. Bamzai was born in 1910 into a Kashmiri Pandit family of scholarly traditions, and received his first lessons in historical research from his father, Anand Koul, who was a pioneer of research on the history and folklore of Kashmir.

Bamzai graduated from the Punjab University with honours in English Literature. During his tenure as a student, he accumulated a series of accomplishments and awards, notable among which were the Lord Chelsford Gold Medal for all-round best graduate and the Suraj Narain Gold Medal for his research on the social and economic condition of Kashmir during his student life.

Bamzai then joined the Kashmir State Information Department as Special Officer. During this period, he was requested by Kashmir&#x27;s prime minister, Sheikh Abdullah, to research and write a comprehensive history of Kashmir. In 1954, Bamzai joined the Publications Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, as Editor of the &quot;Illustrated Kashmir&quot;. He went on to serve as Editor of almost every journal published by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and was instrumental in launching the &quot;March of India&quot;, a journal that recorded the aspirations and advances of newly independent India. Subsequently, he was deputed by the Government of India to work as Adviser to the Government of Ethiopia, where he established the publication wing of the ministry. During this period, he was awarded numerous fellowships and felicitations by several government and non-government organisations for his contribution to Kashmiri history.

Bamzai&#x27;s articles and papers pertaining to the history of Kashmir have been published in several journals in India and abroad. His books on the subject include &quot;A History of Kashmir&quot;, which carries a foreword by Jawaharlal Nehru.

Dr R. K. Parmu observed that Bamzai&#x27;s book lacked historical research and did not separate the historical material from the non-historical content. Sten Widmalm, an academic who specialises in comparative politics, has also expressed reservations, saying that Bamzai&#x27;s three-volume history of Kashmir is &quot;an important source of information but also contain[s] descriptions of the population that only reproduce the race biology of the 1930s&quot;. He also intimates that Bamzai may have re-used or closely copied &quot;formulations&quot; previously published by others. More contemporaneous with publication was a 1965 review in &quot;The English Historical Review&quot; which noted that &quot;A History of Kashmir&quot; was the first attempt by anyone to produce a comprehensive study of the region from pre-history to the present day and that it generally succeeded.

<doc id="1307221" wikidata="Q722604" url="?curid=1307221" title="Reliquary">
<text>A reliquary (also referred to as a &quot;shrine&quot;, by the French term , and historically also referred to as a &quot;phylactery&quot;) is a container for relics. A portable reliquary may be called a &quot;fereter&quot;, and a chapel in which it is housed a &quot;feretory&quot; or feretery.

Relics may be the purported or actual physical remains of saints, and may comprise bones, pieces of clothing, or some object associated with saints or with other religious figures. The authenticity of any given relic is often a matter of debate; for that reason, some churches require documentation of a relic&#x27;s provenance.

Relics have long been important to Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, and to followers of many other religions. These cultures often display reliquaries in shrines, churches, or temples to which the faithful make pilgrimages to gain blessings.

The term is sometimes used loosely for containers for the body parts of non-religious figures; in particular, the kings of France often specified that their hearts and sometimes other organs be buried in a different location from their main burial.

==In Christianity==
The use of reliquaries became an important part of Christian practices from at least the 4th century, initially in the Eastern Churches, which adopted the practice of moving and dividing the bodies of saints much earlier than the West, probably in part because the new capital of Constantinople, unlike Rome, lacked buried saints. Relics are venerated in the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Anglican Churches. Reliquaries provide a means of protecting and displaying relics. While frequently taking the form of caskets, they range in size from simple pendants or rings to very elaborate ossuaries.

The relics were enshrined in containers crafted of or covered with gold, silver, gems, and enamel. Ivory was widely used in the Middle Ages for reliquaries; its pure white color is an indication of the holy status of its contents. These objects constituted a major form of artistic production across Europe and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages.

Many were designed with portability in mind, often being exhibited in public or carried in procession on the saint&#x27;s feast day or on other holy days. Pilgrimages often centered on the veneration of relics. The faithful often venerate relics by bowing before the reliquary or kissing it; those churches that observe the veneration of relics distinguish between the honor given to the saints and the worship that is due to God alone (see Second Council of Nicea).

Sixteenth-century reformers such as Martin Luther opposed the use of relics since many had no proof of historical authenticity and objected to a cult of saints. Many reliquaries, particularly in northern Europe, were destroyed by Calvinists or Calvinist sympathizers during the Reformation, being melted down or pulled apart to recover precious metals and gems. Nonetheless, the use and manufacture of reliquaries continue to this day, especially in Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian countries. 

===Forms===
The earliest reliquaries were essentially boxes, either simply box-shaped or based on an architectural design, taking the form of a model of a church with a pitched roof. These latter are known by the French term chasse, and typical examples from the 12th to 14th century have wooden frameworks with gilt-copper plaques nailed on, decorated in champlevé enamel. Limoges was the largest production centre; NB the English usage differs from that of the French &quot;châsse&quot;, which denotes large size rather than shape.

Relics of the True Cross became very popular from the 9th century onward and were housed in magnificent gold and silver cross-shaped reliquaries decorated with enamels and precious stones. From about the end of the 10th century, reliquaries in the shape of the relics they housed also became popular; hence, for instance, the skull of Pope Alexander I was housed in a head-shaped reliquary. Similarly, the bones of saints were often housed in reliquaries that recalled the shape of the original body part, such as an arm or a foot.

Many Eastern Orthodox reliquaries housing tiny pieces of relics have circular or cylindrical slots in which small disks of wax-mastic are placed, in which the actual relic is embedded.

A philatory is a transparent reliquary designed to contain and exhibit the bones and relics of saints. This style of reliquary has a viewing portal to view the relic inside. The &quot;feretrum&quot; was a medieval form of reliquary or shrine containing the sacred effigies and relics of a saint.

During the later Middle Ages, the monstrance form, primarily used for consecrated hosts, was sometimes used for reliquaries. These housed the relic in a rock crystal, or glass capsule mounted on a column above a base, enabling the relic to be displayed to the faithful. Reliquaries in the form of large pieces of metalwork jewellery also appeared around this time, housing tiny relics such as pieces of the Holy Thorn, notably the Holy Thorn Reliquary now in the British Museum.

==In Buddhism==
In Buddhism, stupas are an important form of a reliquary and may be buried inside larger structures such as a stupa or chorten. Particularly in China and throughout East and Southeast Asia, these take the form of a pagoda; in Japan, this is known as a &quot;tō&quot;.

Two famous very early excavated reliquaries are the 1st-century Bimaran Casket and the Kanishka Casket of 127 AD, both believed to have contained part of the cremated remains of Gautama Buddha. Relics associated with Buddha are the most important in Buddhism, but those related to other enlightened figures like Sariputta and Moggallana are also highly revered. 

In Buddhism, relics are known as cetiya; one of the most significant is the relic of the tooth of the Buddha in Sri Lanka. In Japan, Buddhist relics are known as , and are often stored in a . (See also: Japanese Buddhist architecture) The Golden Pavilion at Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto is a well-known example of a &quot;shariden&quot;.

<doc id="1307223" wikidata="Q3051958" url="?curid=1307223" title="Ranji Trophy">
<text>The Ranji Trophy is a premier domestic first-class cricket championship played in India and organized annually by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The teams representing regional and state cricket associations participate. BCCI founded the championship in 1934, Since then, it has been organised across various grounds and stadia in India.

The competition currently consists of 38 teams, including at least one team from each of the 28 states of India and four of the eight union territories. When the tournament was founded, it was named &quot;the Cricket Championship of India&quot;, in 1935 it was renamed after Ranjitsinhji, who was the first Indian to play international cricket. He played for England from 1896 to 1902.

The Mumbai cricket team is the most successful team of the tournament, with a record 42 titles to their name.

The Mumbai cricket team holds the present title of the 2023–24 edition, which is its 42nd. It defeated Vidharbha cricket team in the final at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai.

==History==
The idea of a national level, first class championship tournament was proposed by BCCI&#x27;s founder A.S. De Mello. The competition was launched following BCCI&#x27;s meeting at Shimla in July 1934, with the first fixtures taking place in 1934–35 .Initially the tournament was named as &#x27;The cricket championship of India&#x27;, it later was renamed. The trophy was donated by Bhupinder Singh, the Maharaja of Patiala in memory of Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, Jam Sahib of Nawanagar who had died the previous year. The first match of the competition was held on 4 November 1934 between Madras and Mysore at the Chepauk ground in Madras (Now Chennai). Mumbai (Bombay) has won the tournament the most times with 42 wins, including 15 back-to-back wins from 1958–59 to 1972–73.

In 2015, Paytm became the first company to hold the tournament&#x27;s title sponsorship right by virtue of BCCI&#x27;s title sponsorship deal.

The 2020–21 Ranji Trophy tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first season since the tournament&#x27;s inception that it was not held.

==Participants==

State and regional teams with first-class status and owned–operated by BCCI members play in the Ranji Trophy. Most associations are regional such as the Mumbai Cricket Association or the Karnataka State Cricket Association, while Railways and Services are pan-Indian.

All 28 states of India are represented, as are four of the eight union territories: Delhi, Chandigarh, Puducherry, and Jammu and Kashmir (which also represents the union territory of Ladakh). In addition, four teams represent regions within states: Mumbai and Vidarbha (both within Maharashtra) and Saurashtra and Baroda (both within Gujarat), though Maharashtra and Gujarat play as separate teams; and there are two pan-Indian teams: Railways, representing Indian Railways, and Services, representing the Indian Armed Forces. The state of Telangana is represented by the Hyderabad cricket team.

===Current teams===
The following 38 teams currently participate in the Ranji Trophy:

===Defunct teams===

==Stadiums ==

==Format==
From the Ranji Trophy&#x27;s inception until the 2001 season (with the exception of 1948–49 season), the teams were grouped geographically into four or five zones – North, West, East, and South, with Central added in 1952–53. Initial matches were played within the zones on a knock-out basis until 1956–57, and thereafter on a league basis, to determine a winner; then, the five individual zone winners competed in a knock-out tournament, leading to a final which decided the winner of the Ranji Trophy. From the 1970–71 season, the knock-out stage was expanded to the top two teams from each zone, a total of ten qualifying teams. This was expanded again to the top three from each zone in 1992–93, a total of fifteen qualifying teams; between 1996–97 and 1999–2000, the fifteen qualifying teams competed in a secondary group stage, with three groups of five teams, and the top two from each group qualified for a six-team knock-out stage; in all other years until 2001–02, a full fifteen-team knock-out tournament was held.

The format was changed in the 2002–03 season with the zonal system abandoned and a two-division structure adopted – the Elite Group, containing fifteen teams, and the Plate Group, containing the rest. Each group had two sub-groups which played a round-robin; the top two from each Elite sub-group then contested a four-team knock-out tournament to determine the winner of the Ranji Trophy. The team which finished last in each Elite sub-group was relegated, and both Plate Group finalists were promoted for the following season. For the 2006–07 season, the divisions were re-labelled the Super League and Plate League respectively.

In the 2008–09 season, this format was adjusted to give both Super League and Plate League teams an opportunity to contest the Ranji Trophy. The top two from each Plate sub-group contested semi-finals; the winners of these two matches then joined the top three from each Super League sub-group in an eight-team knock-out tournament. The winner of this knock-out tournament then won the Ranji Trophy. Promotion and relegation between Super League and Plate League continued as before. In the 2010–11 season, Rajasthan won the Ranji Trophy after beginning the season in the Plate League.

From the 2012–13 season, this format was adjusted slightly. The Super League and Plate League names were abandoned, but the two-tier system remained. The top tier expanded from fifteen teams to eighteen teams, in two sub-groups of nine (known as Group A and Group B, and considered equal in status); and the second tier was reduced to nine teams in a single group (known as Group C). The top three teams from Groups A and B and the top two from Group C contest the knockout phase. The lowest placed team in each of Group A and Group B is relegated to Group C, and the top two from Group C are promoted to the top tier.

For the 2017–18 season, the two-tier system was abandoned to have 4 groups of seven teams each and two quarter-finalists from each group.

From the 2018–19 season, the teams contested in three-tiers. Five teams will qualify for the quarter-finals from the top tier (known as Elite Group A and Group B). Two teams will qualify from the second-tier (Elite Group C) and one team from the lower-tier (Plate Group) for the quarter-finals.

Round-robin matches are four days in length; knockout matches are played for five days. Throughout its history, if there is no outright result in a Ranji Trophy knock-out match, the team leading after the first innings is the winner.

Prior to the 2016–17 season, matches were played at the home ground of one of the two teams taking part. For the 2016–17 edition, the BCCI decided that all games would be staged at a neutral venues.

<doc id="1307226" wikidata="Q386787" url="?curid=1307226" title="Variable-width encoding">
<text>A variable-width encoding is a type of character encoding scheme in which codes of differing lengths are used to encode a character set (a repertoire of symbols) for representation, usually in a computer. Most common variable-width encodings are multibyte encodings (aka MBCS – multi-byte character set), which use varying numbers of bytes (octets) to encode different characters. (Some authors, notably in Microsoft documentation, use the term &quot;multibyte character set,&quot; which is a misnomer, because representation size is an attribute of the encoding, not of the character set.)

Early variable-width encodings using less than a byte per character were sometimes used to pack English text into fewer bytes in adventure games for early microcomputers. However disks (which unlike tapes allowed random access allowing text to be loaded on demand), increases in computer memory and general purpose compression algorithms have rendered such tricks largely obsolete.

Multibyte encodings are usually the result of a need to increase the number of characters which can be encoded without breaking backward compatibility with an existing constraint. For example, with one byte (8 bits) per character, one can encode 256 possible characters; in order to encode more than 256 characters, the obvious choice would be to use two or more bytes per encoding unit, two bytes (16 bits) would allow 65,536 possible characters, but such a change would break compatibility with existing systems and therefore might not be feasible at all.

==General structure==
Since the aim of a multibyte encoding system is to minimise changes to existing application software, some characters must retain their pre-existing single-unit codes, even while other characters have multiple units in their codes. The result is that there are three sorts of units in a variable-width encoding: singletons, which consist of a single unit, lead units, which come first in a multiunit sequence, and trail units, which come afterwards in a multiunit sequence. Input and display software obviously needs to know about the structure of the multibyte encoding scheme, but other software generally doesn&#x27;t need to know if a pair of bytes represent two separate characters or just one character.

For example, the four character string &quot;I♥NY&quot; is encoded in UTF-8 like this (shown as hexadecimal byte values): . Of the six units in that sequence, 49, 4E, and 59 are singletons (for &quot;I, N,&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;), is a lead unit and and are trail units. The heart symbol is represented by the combination of the lead unit and the two trail units.

UTF-8 makes it easy for a program to identify the three sorts of units, since they fall into separate value ranges. Older variable-width encodings are typically not as well-designed, since the ranges may overlap. A text processing application that deals with the variable-width encoding must then scan the text from the beginning of all definitive sequences in order to identify the various units and interpret the text correctly. In such encodings, one is liable to encounter false positives when searching for a string in the middle of the text. For example, if the hexadecimal values DE, DF, E0, and E1 can all be either lead units or trail units, then a search for the two-unit sequence DF E0 can yield a false positive in the sequence DE DF E0 E1, which consists of two consecutive two-unit sequences. There is also the danger that a single corrupted or lost unit may render the whole interpretation of a large run of multiunit sequences incorrect. In a variable-width encoding where all three types of units are disjunct, string searching always works without false positives, and (provided the decoder is well written) the corruption or loss of one unit corrupts only one character.

==CJK multibyte encodings==
The first use of multibyte encodings was for the encoding of Chinese, Japanese and Korean, which have large character sets well in excess of 256 characters. At first the encoding was constrained to the limit of 7 bits. The ISO-2022-JP, ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-KR encodings used the range 21–7E (hexadecimal) for both lead units and trail units, and marked them off from the singletons by using ISO 2022 escape sequences to switch between single-byte and multibyte mode. A total of 8,836 (94×94) characters could be encoded at first, and further sets of 94×94 characters with switching. The ISO 2022 encoding schemes for CJK are still in use on the Internet. The stateful nature of these encodings and the large overlap make them very awkward to process.

On Unix platforms, the ISO 2022 7-bit encodings were replaced by a set of 8-bit encoding schemes, the Extended Unix Code: EUC-JP, EUC-CN and EUC-KR. Instead of distinguishing between the multiunit sequences and the singletons with escape sequences, which made the encodings stateful, multiunit sequences were marked by having the most significant bit set, that is, being in the range 80–FF (hexadecimal), while the singletons were in the range 00–7F alone. The lead units and trail units were in the range A1 to FE (hexadecimal), that is, the same as their range in the ISO 2022 encodings, but with the high bit set to 1. These encodings were reasonably easy to work with provided all your delimiters were ASCII characters and you avoided truncating strings to fixed lengths, but a break in the middle of a multibyte character could still cause major corruption.

On the PC (DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms), two encodings became established for Japanese and Traditional Chinese in which all of singletons, lead units and trail units overlapped: Shift-JIS and Big5 respectively. In Shift-JIS, lead units had the range 81–9F and E0–FC, trail units had the range 40–7E and 80–FC, and singletons had the range 21–7E and A1–DF. In Big5, lead units had the range A1–FE, trail units had the range 40–7E and A1–FE, and singletons had the range 21–7E (all values in hexadecimal). This overlap again made processing tricky, though at least most of the symbols had unique byte values (though strangely the backslash does not).

==Unicode variable-width encodings==
The Unicode standard has two variable-width encodings: UTF-8 and UTF-16 (it also has a fixed-width encoding, UTF-32). Originally, both the Unicode and ISO 10646 standards were meant to be fixed-width, with Unicode being 16-bit and ISO 10646 being 32-bit. ISO 10646 provided a variable-width encoding called UTF-1, in which singletons had the range 00–9F, lead units the range A0–FF and trail units the ranges A0–FF and 21–7E. Because of this bad design, similar to Shift JIS and Big5 in its overlap of values, the inventors of the Plan 9 operating system, the first to implement Unicode throughout, abandoned it and replaced it with a much better designed variable-width encoding for Unicode: UTF-8, in which singletons have the range 00–7F, lead units have the range C0–FD (now actually C2–F4, to avoid overlong sequences and to maintain synchronism with the encoding capacity of UTF-16; see the UTF-8 article), and trail units have the range 80–BF. The lead unit also tells how many trail units follow: one after C2–DF, two after E0–EF and three after F0–F4.

UTF-16 was devised to break free of the 65,536-character limit of the original Unicode (1.x) without breaking compatibility with the 16-bit encoding. In UTF-16, singletons have the range 0000–D7FF (55,296 code points) and E000–FFFF (8192 code points, 63,488 in total), lead units the range D800–DBFF (1024 code points) and trail units the range DC00–DFFF (1024 code points, 2048 in total). The lead and trail units, called &quot;high surrogates&quot; and &quot;low surrogates&quot;, respectively, in Unicode terminology, map 1024×1024 or 1,048,576 supplementary characters, making 1,112,064 (63,488 BMP code points + 1,048,576 code points represented by high and low surrogate pairs) encodable code points, or &quot;scalar values&quot; in Unicode parlance (surrogates are not encodable).

<text>London Town (also known as My Heart Goes Crazy ) is a 1946 Technicolor musical film directed by Wesley Ruggles and starring Sid Field and Petula Clark. The screenplay was by Sig Herzig, Val Guest and Elliot Paul, based on a story by Ruggles. According to Allmovie, the film was &quot;one of the most notorious flops in the history of the British cinema.&quot;

==Plot summary==

==Production==
The critical and financial failure of the extravagant film, Britain&#x27;s first major Technicolor musical, is part of British film legend. Financed by the Rank Organisation at a time of rationing and shortages of materials in the period immediately after World War II, it was filmed in the shell of &quot;Sound City Shepperton&quot;, which had been made available as a film studio after being requisitioned during the war as a factory for aircraft parts. (The studio was later renamed Shepperton Studios and is still used for film production).

Music Hall performer Field had cheered up wartime London audiences with his hugely successful stage variety shows, including &quot;Strike a New Note&quot; (1943), &quot;Strike it Again&quot; (1944), and &quot;Piccadilly Hayride&quot; (1946), so he seemed a natural for the lead. As he was of the opinion that no British director was capable of making a good musical, he insisted on having an American at the helm, and the task fell to Wesley Ruggles, who produced as well.

Given that Ruggles had no experience with the genre – his best-known films at that point were the Academy Award-winning Western epic &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931) and the Mae West comedy &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; (1933), both more than a decade old – and his Hollywood career was on a downslide, he was an odd choice indeed.

Val Guest said he did not write the script but he &quot;did a script of all Sid&#x27;s stuff&quot; because they had worked together on stage. 

J. Arthur Rank spent large sums of money for American songwriters (Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke), musicians (Ted Heath and his orchestra), and costumes by the legendary designer Orry-Kelly, while at the same time re-equipping the studio from the ground up. He was confident that box-office business was booming at the time and that demand for a flashy musical entertainment would be such that he would make a healthy profit, so his financial controls were slack.

Kay Kendall was promoted as England&#x27;s answer to Lana Turner. &quot;Nobody had ever heard of me but they called me a star&quot;, she later recalled. &quot;I opened bazaars, signed autographs, went to premieres, did everything a star was supposed to do. My photograph was on magazine covers and front pages of newspapers. And all before we&#x27;d ever finished the picture.&quot;

Guest said &quot;Wes Ruggles needed somebody firm on top of him and he didn’t have anybody. I think they were overawed by his “weight” [gravitas] because his biography read like movie history. It just didn’t hang together, it was a very bad script&quot;. He added, &quot;I spent quite a lot of time down there trying to hot things up, it was heart-breaking. Sid was also doing a show at the same time, and was having slight drinking problems – not a lot... Wes was sober during shooting yes, absolutely paralytic at night.&quot;

==Reception==
So much was spent on production that the film needed to perform better than possible just to break even. However, dismissed by critics (who described it as &quot;tacky&quot; and &quot;tasteless&quot;) and ignored by audiences, it was a legendary flop. In hindsight, however, especially for nostalgia fans, many of its kitschy aspects make it fascinating, and film historians consider it an interesting record of the times in which it takes place. Following Britain&#x27;s victory in the war, it can be seen as a tribute to London and its residents, and as a celebration of popular Cockney culture, especially its music hall traditions.

It should also be pointed out that according to trade papers, the film was a &quot;notable box office attraction&quot; at British cinemas in 1946. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; it was a runner-up for best box office success in 1946 Britain.

Kay Kendall said after the film&#x27;s release there were &quot;no more bazaars to open, no more premieres, no more autographs.&quot; However her career later recovered and she became a major star of British films, before dying of leukaemia in 1959 at the age of just 32.

According to Val Guest &quot;after it folded in America, they took all Sid’s routines out of the picture and joined them all together and issued it. As a sort of comedy half-hour. And that became the rage in Hollywood, everybody had it at their parties because they thought he was quite fabulous. And Sinatra had special showings, it went around all the people there, it became a cult thing.&quot;

Ruggles and Guest were going to make a film together about the Rolls Royce family but those plans ended after the financial failure of &quot;London Town&quot;.

&quot;London Town&quot; was the starting point for the career of Susan Shaw.

==Music==
Songs in &quot;London Town&quot; include &quot;You Can&#x27;t Keep a Good Dreamer Down&quot;, &quot;The &#x27;Ampstead Way&quot; (most definitely inspired by &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot; from the earlier stage production &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;), &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows&quot;, a medley of Cockney songs (&quot;Knock &#x27;em in the Old Kent Road&quot;/&quot;Any Old Iron&quot;/&quot;Follow the Van&quot;), &quot;Don&#x27;t Dilly Dally on the Way&quot; (sung by Charles Collins), and &quot;My Heart Goes Crazy&quot;, which was the title under which an abridged U.S. version of the film was released by United Artists in 1953.

In September 2006, the film&#x27;s soundtrack – plus bonus tracks including four early studio recordings by Clark – was released on CD by Sepia Records.

==Media==
The original two-hour-12 minute version, which never was released commercially, is now available for viewing at the archives at the BFI Southbank.

In September 2011, the full-length version of the film was made commercially available for the first time, when it was released on a PAL DVD by Odeon Entertainment in the U.K. (Running time is listed as 122 mins. on Amazon UK, so that would be shortened. Or, that might simply be running fast at PAL speed, 25 frames per second instead of transferred correctly at film speed of 24 fps.)

<text>Sphere is a 1998 American science fiction psychological thriller film directed and produced by Barry Levinson, adapted by Kurt Wimmer, and starring Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson. It is based on Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film was released in the United States on February 14, 1998.

== Plot ==
A spacecraft presumed to be of alien origin is discovered on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, estimated to have been there for nearly 300 years. A team of experts, including marine biologist Dr. Beth Halperin, mathematician Dr. Harry Adams, astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding, psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman, and U.S. Navy Captain Harold Barnes, is assembled and taken to the Habitat, a state-of-the-art underwater living environment located near the spacecraft.

Examining the spacecraft, they are perplexed to learn it is not alien at all, but rather American in origin. However, its technology far surpasses any in the present day. The ship&#x27;s computer logs cryptically suggest a mission that originated either in the distant past or future, but the team deduces that the long-dead crew was tasked with collecting an item of scientific importance.

Norman and Beth discover the ship&#x27;s logs, with the last entry noting an &quot;unknown event&quot;. A holographic reenactment of the event reveals that hundreds of years in the future, the ship encountered a black hole, which apparently led to a crash landing in the ocean, back in the 1700s. Soon after, Norman and the others stumble on a large, yet perfect sphere hovering in the cargo bay. They cannot find any way to probe the inside of the sphere, as the fluid surface seems to be impenetrable. On observation, Norman ominously notes that the sphere reflects everything in the room, except them.

When they return to the Habitat, Harry hypothesizes that everyone on this team is fated to die. Harry notes that the black hole is referred to as an &quot;unknown event&quot; in the future logs. However, here in the present, they have knowledge of the historic event, yet it is unable to be explained later on. During the night, Harry returns to the spacecraft and is able to enter the sphere. Norman follows Harry, where he finds him unconscious next to the sphere, and returns him to the Habitat.

The next day, the crew discovers a series of numerically encoded messages appearing on the computer screens. The crew is able to decipher them, and comes to believe they are speaking to &quot;Jerry&quot;, an alien intelligence from the sphere. They find that Jerry is able to see and hear everything that happens on the Habitat.

A powerful typhoon strikes the surface, and the Habitat crew is forced to stay in the Habitat several more days. During that time, a series of tragedies strikes the crew, including attacks from aggressive jellyfish and a giant squid, and equipment failures in the base that kill Ted and the team&#x27;s support staff. The survivors, Beth, Harry and Norman, believe Jerry is responsible. Norman discovers that they had misinterpreted the initial messages from Jerry, and that the entity speaking to them through the computers is actually Harry himself, transmitted from his mind while he is asleep. Norman and Beth eventually realize that when Harry entered the sphere, he gained the ability to make anything he imagines a reality, and they conclude that all the horrors that have befallen the Habitat were manifestations of Harry&#x27;s fears.

Norman and Beth sedate Harry with enough sleeping drugs to put him into a dreamless sleep, to prevent him from doing any further damage. However, when Norman is attacked by a snake, Beth realizes that Harry alone could not have been responsible for everything that had happened on the Habitat, and she confronts Norman, accusing him of entering the sphere when he went to retrieve Harry. Beth&#x27;s suspicions prove to be correct, but after experiencing her own nightmarish vision, she confesses to Norman that she too entered the sphere.

When rejoined by Harry, the three of them realize that the crew of the ship must have also entered the sphere, and they ended up killing each other after being driven mad by their fears. Under the stress of the situation, Beth has suicidal thoughts, which causes the detonation mechanisms on a store of explosives to engage, threatening to destroy the base and the spacecraft. They race to the Habitat&#x27;s mini-sub, but their combined fears cause them to reappear back in the spacecraft. As a psychologist, Norman is able to see through the illusion. He triggers the mini-sub&#x27;s undocking process, and overrides the others&#x27; fears that they will not escape the destruction of the Habitat and spacecraft. The sphere is untouched by the explosions.

The mini-sub makes it to the surface as the surface ships return. As Beth, Harry and Norman begin safe decompression, they realize that they will be debriefed and their newfound powers discovered. They agree to erase their memories of the event using their powers, ensuring the &quot;unknown event&quot; paradox is resolved. The sphere rises from the ocean and accelerates into space.

== Production ==
Hoffman joined the cast because of Levinson&#x27;s involvement. Hoffman and Levinson had collaborated on several prior projects, and Hoffman had faith that Levinson could raise the project beyond its script.

Due to budgetary concerns, pre-production stopped in October 1996, and the script was revised. In the interim, Levinson directed &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, which also starred Hoffman.

Shooting on &quot;Sphere&quot; began in March 1997, with a budget that &quot;Variety&quot; estimates was $80 million. Shooting took place at a naval base on Mare Island in Vallejo, California. Principal photography ended in July 1997, after 68 days.

== Release ==
&quot;Sphere&quot; initially had a Christmas release date, but was moved forward to avoid competition. Warner Bros. released the film theatrically in the U.S. February 13, 1998, where it debuted in third place and grossed $37 million in total. &quot;Sphere&quot; did almost as well internationally, grossing $73.4 million worldwide.

== Reception ==
&quot;Sphere&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 13%, based on 55 reviews, with an average score of 4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;&quot;Sphere&quot; features an A-level cast working with B-grade material, with a story seen previously in superior science-fiction films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a &quot;C−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said that it was derivative of classic science fiction films and devoid of suspense.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;While this is no quick-witted treat on a par with Mr. Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, it&#x27;s a solid thriller with showy scientific overtones.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; characterized it as a flop. Kenneth Turan wrote: &quot;The more the movie explains itself, the more ordinary it becomes.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, and stated: &quot;&quot;Sphere&quot; feels rushed. The screenplay uses lots of talk to conceal the fact that the story has never been grappled with.&quot;

== Soundtrack ==
The score for &quot;Sphere&quot; was composed by Elliot Goldenthal.

Crew credits
* Music composed and produced by Elliot Goldenthal
* Orchestrated by Robert Elhai and Elliot Goldenthal
* Conducted by Stephen Mercurio and Jonathan Sheffer
* Recorded and mixed by Joel Iwataki
* Electronic music produced by Richard Martinez
* Film music editor: Curtis Roush
* Additional orchestrations by Deniz Hughes

== Legacy ==
Barry Levinson said he had been inspired to write the basic plot line for his subsequent film, &quot;Liberty Heights&quot;, based on a review of &quot;Sphere&quot; for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Its critic, Lisa Schwarzbaum, specified that Hoffman played &quot;the empathetic Jewish psychologist. Okay, so he&#x27;s not officially Jewish; he&#x27;s only Hoffman, who arrives at the floating habitat and immediately announces, noodgey and menschlike, &#x27;I&#x27;d like to call my family.&#x27; You do the math.&quot; Levinson remarked:

<text>Four destroyers in the United States Navy comprised the &quot;Cassin&quot; class. All served as convoy escorts during World War I. The &quot;Cassin&quot;s were the first of five &quot;second-generation&quot; 1000-ton four-stack destroyer classes that were front-line ships of the Navy until the 1930s. They were known as &quot;thousand tonners&quot; for their normal displacement, while the previous classes were nicknamed &quot;flivvers&quot; for their small size, after the Model T Ford.

They were the first to carry the new /50 caliber guns. The number of torpedo tubes was increased from the six carried by the to eight. The additional armament significantly increased their tonnage to over 1,000 tons and decreased their speed to less than , despite an increase from to .

The was built concurrently, and those four ships are often considered to be &quot;Cassin&quot;s. Both classes were ordered in fiscal year 1912.

The class performed convoy escort missions in the Atlantic in World War I. Hulls 43–45 served in the United States Coast Guard as part of the Rum Patrol in 1924–31. All were scrapped 1934–35 to comply with the London Naval Treaty.

==Design==
The increase in normal displacement to over 1,000 tons was due to the desire to combine a heavy armament with a substantial cruising range. The US Navy at the time had only three modern scout cruisers of the , so the destroyers had to double as scouts. The engineering arrangement of two-shaft direct drive turbines was similar to some previous ships, but the poor performance of early cruising turbines caused a reversion to reciprocating engines for cruising. Hulls 43 and 44 had a triple expansion engine that could be clutched to one shaft for cruising; the other pair of ships had a similar arrangement on both shafts.

===&quot;Thousand tonner&quot; development===
The &quot;thousand tonner&quot; type included 26 destroyers in five classes: four &quot;Cassin&quot;s, four &quot;Aylwin&quot;s, six s, six s, and six s. The ships were commissioned 1913–17. As the type developed the gun armament of four 4 inch (102 mm) guns remained the same, torpedo armament greatly increased, and displacement rose by about 100 tons. The &quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Aylwin&quot; classes had eight 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in twin broadside mounts, two mounts on each side. The &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;s introduced the torpedo to the US destroyer force, but the number of tubes remained at eight. In the &quot;Sampson&quot;s, torpedo armament was increased to twelve 21 inch (533 mm) tubes by replacing the twin mounts with triple mounts. The subsequent &quot;flush deck&quot; types retained the gun and torpedo armament of the &quot;Sampson&quot;s on a new hull with displacement increased by about 100 tons, and with a new engineering plant. The thousand tonners also debuted US destroyer anti-aircraft armament: two 1-pounder (37 mm) autocannons were specified for the &quot;Tucker&quot;s but not fitted until the &quot;Sampson&quot;s.

In engineering, cruising turbines were re-introduced with the &quot;Tucker&quot; and &quot;Sampson&quot; classes. had prototype fully geared turbines without cruising turbines; this arrangement was later adopted for the &quot;flush deckers&quot;; other flush deckers had geared turbines with varying cruising arrangements.

===Armament===
The gun armament of four /50 caliber Mark 9 guns was a significant increase from the five guns of the &quot;Paulding&quot; class, and remained the standard US destroyer gun armament through the &quot;flush deck&quot; &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers commissioned through 1921. It reflected the increasing size of foreign destroyers that the &quot;Cassin&quot;s might have to fight. The torpedo armament of eight 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes was an increase of two tubes over the &quot;Paulding&quot;s. A factor in the size of the torpedo armament was the General Board&#x27;s decision to use broadside rather than centerline torpedo tubes. This was due to the desire to have some torpedoes remaining after firing a broadside, and problems experienced with centerline mounts on previous classes with torpedoes striking the gunwales of the firing ship.

The class was probably equipped with one or two depth charge racks each for anti-submarine convoy escort missions in World War I.

===Engineering===
Most references list the propulsion plant of &quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Cummings&quot; as standard for the class. However, the Navy&#x27;s official &quot;Ships&#x27; Data Book&quot; for 1912 shows there was some variation. &quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Cummings&quot; had four Normand boilers supplying steam to two direct-drive Parsons-type steam turbines driving two shafts for a total of . A small triple-expansion engine could be clutched to one shaft for economical cruising at moderate speeds. Early steam turbines were inefficient at low speed, and this was only remedied with the rise in steam pressure and the introduction of geared cruising turbines during World War I. &quot;Downes&quot; had Thornycroft boilers and &quot;Duncan&quot; had Yarrow boilers. Both of these had Curtis steam turbines and triple-expansion cruising engines on both shafts.

&quot;Downes&quot; made on trials at . Normal fuel oil capacity was 312 tons.

<text>Fengbo (Chinese: 風伯), also known as Fengshi, is the Taoist deity of the wind. In ancient times, he was depicted as a grotesque deity with the body of a deer, the head of a bird, horns, the tail of a snake, and patterns of a leopard. Eventually, Fengbo was replaced by Feng Po Po. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, he was an object of state ritual from early times, with temples and festivals held in honor of him.

== Mythology of the Ming dynasty ==
In the mythology of the Ming dynasty, Fengbo was also known as the Count of the Wind (Chinese: 風伯方天君, pinyin: &quot;Fēng bó fāng tiān jūn&quot;). He is depicted as an old man holding a fan, with a yellow cloak, a blue and red cap, and a white beard. He holds a goatskin bag of winds and directs them as he pleases. He is considered a stellar divinity, under the control of the star Ch’i of the Sagittarius constellation. In some myths, Fengbo lives in this constellation, where he looks after the solar breezes; when the moon passes too close to his star, he gets a little flustered, allowing too much wind to escape from his sack.

== Fei Lian ==
Fei Lian is considered the dragon form of Fengbo. There are two origin stories of Fei Lian.

Legends say that Fei Lian was originally one of the supporters of the rebel Chi You, who was defeated by Huang Di. He was transformed into a spiritual monster and stirred up tremendous winds in the southern regions. Emperor Yao sent Shen Yi and three hundred soldiers to quiet the storms and appease Chi You relatives, who were wreaking their vengeance on the people. Shên I ordered the people to spread a long cloth in front of their house and secure it to the ground with stones; this caused the wind to blow against it and change direction. Shen Yi then flew through the wind to the top of a high mountain and they saw a monster, white and yellow in color breathing deeply. Shen Yi understood that the monster was the cause of all these storms and decided to shoot an arrow and try to kill it. The monster ran and hid in a deep cave. Shen Yi followed the monster which drew its sword and dared him to attack the Mother of Winds. Shen Yi bravely decided to face the monster and shot another arrow, this time hitting it in the knee. The monster was finally defeated. It immediately dropped its sword and begged for its life.

Another legend says that Fei Lian appears as a dragon. He was initially one of the tyrant Chou&#x27;s wicked ministers and could walk with unheard-of swiftness. Both he and his son E Lai, who was so strong that he could tear a tiger and rhinoceros to pieces with his bare hands, were killed while in service of Chou Wang. The legend says that Fei Lien had the body of a stag, about the size of a leopard, with a bird&#x27;s head, horns, and a snake&#x27;s tail, and was able to make the wind blow whenever he wished.

Some myths say that Fengbo is a subordinate of Chiyou and assists him in his struggle against the Yellow Emperor in the Battle of Zhuolu. He has been known to be friendly with the rain deity Yu Shi. Fengbo is considered a neutral god and does not belong to any faction. Fengbo, in his dragon form, is considered a troublemaker who needs to be watched by Shen Yi. In the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; (韓非子) or book of master Han Fei, when Huangdi the Yellow Emperor gathers all the demons at Mount Tai Fengbo sweeps the path.

<text>The Yug () is a river in Kichmengsko-Gorodetsky, Nikolsky, and Velikoustyugsky Districts of Vologda Oblast and in Podosinovsky District of Kirov Oblast in Russia. It is long, and the area of its basin is . The Yug joins the Sukhona near the town of Veliky Ustyug, forming the Northern Dvina, one of the biggest rivers of European Russia. 

The principal tributaries of the Yug are the Sharzhenga (left), the Kichmenga (left), the Yontala (right), the Pushma (right), and the Luza (right). Most of the course of the Yug runs through the Northern Ridge, and the Yug is one of the biggest rivers crossing the ridge.

The name of the river is identical to the Russian word for &quot;south&quot;, but has Finno-Ugric origins and originates from the Komi word &quot;ju&quot;, which means &quot;water&quot;. It is cognate with &quot;joki&quot; &quot;river&quot; in the most river names in Finland and further with Oka, Vuoksi, Vakh, Yogan, etc. in Russia.

The towns of Veliky Ustyug and Nikolsk, as well as the district centers Kichmengsky Gorodok and Podosinovets, are located on the banks of the Yug.

The source of the Yug is in the southern part of Kichmensko-Gorodetsky District, south of the village of Kaleplikha. The river flows southwest, enters Nikolsky District, runs all the way almost to the border of Kostroma Oblast and sharply turns northwest. The town of Nikolsk is located on both banks of the Yug, and upstream from Nikolsk the valley is already densely populated. Downstream from Nikolsk, the Yug is navigable, although there is no passenger navigation with the exception of several ferry crossings. The river course runs further to the north, re-enters Kichmengsko-Gorodetsky District, turns northeast, accepts the Kichmenga from the left in the &quot;selo&quot; of Kichmengsky Gorodok, and enters Kirov Oblast. In Podosinovets, the Yug accepts the Pushma from the right, turns north, then turns west, and enters Velikoustyugsky District of Vologda Oblast. The Yug accepts the Luza, its biggest tributary, from the right, and turns north before joining the Sukhona.

There are a number of bridges in the upper course of the Yug, but downstream from Kichmengsky Gorodok there is only one bridge, located in Podosinovets.

==History==
In 14th-15th century the upper course of the Yug, around Nikolsk, was a disputed territory between Grand Duchy of Moscow and Novgorod Republic. Novgorod controlled the major part of Russian North, and, in particular, all areas along the Sukhona, whereas Moscow controlled Veliky Ustyug, which it inherited from the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The Yug was the waterway Moscow used to get to Veliky Ustyug. In the end of 15th century, Novgorod was appended to Grand Duchy of Moscow, and Nikolsk became one of the key points on the way from Moscow to the White Sea, which until 1703 was the main route for the foreign trade in Russia. In particular, the harbor in Nikolsk was used to transport cargo.

<doc id="1307275" wikidata="Q5188437" url="?curid=1307275" title="Cross and circle game">
<text>Cross and circle is a board game design used for race games played throughout the world.

== Design ==

The basic design comprises a circle divided into four equal portions by a cross inscribed inside it like four spokes in a wheel; the classic example of this design is Yut. However, the term &quot;cross and circle game&quot; is also applied to boards that replace the circle with a square, and cruciform boards that collapse the circle onto the cross; all three types are topologically equivalent. Ludo and &quot;Parcheesi&quot; (both descendants of Pachisi) are examples of frequently played cruciform games.

The category may also be expanded to include circular or square boards &quot;without&quot; a cross which are nevertheless quartered (Zohn Ahl), and boards that have more than four spokes (Aggravation, Trivial Pursuit). The game board for the Aztec game Patolli consists of a collapsed circle &quot;without&quot; an interior cross and thus has the distinction of being a cross that &quot;is&quot; a circle (topologically), without being a cross &quot;plus&quot; circle.

Tokens are moved around spaces drawn on the circle and on the cross, with the goal of being the first player to move all tokens all the way around the board. Generally the circle of the cross and circle forms the primary circuit followed by the players&#x27; pieces. The function of the cross is more variable; for example, in Yut the cross forms shortcuts to the finish, whereas in Pachisi the four spokes are used as player-specific exits and entrances to the pieces&#x27; home. In non-race games (like Coppit and Trivial Pursuit) all paths may be undifferentiated in function.

== History ==
Although these board game designs may be of considerable antiquity, firm evidence is sparse. In India, there are uncited claims that the most ancient board games would date back to BC 3500 in the time of legendary Ruler King Bharata. Noted writer and translator Gilles Schaufelberger lists Sanskrit words for board and dice games from ancient India (based on Heinrich Lüders&#x27; work). For cruciform boards, the monumental Pachisi or Chaupat boards of the Moghul ruler Akbar (1542–1605), designed to accommodate humans as playing pieces, &quot;still represent the earliest secure evidence for the existence of the game in India.&quot; Culin found evidence for a Nyout-like game existing in China in the 3rd century AD, though this does not seem to be accepted by H. J. R. Murray. Mayan cross and circle boards have been found on stones from the 7th century AD. Although frequently encountered among the native tribes of North America (particularly as a &quot;quartered circle&quot; design) these boards were not made of durable materials, so generally the writings and collections of European-Americans constitute their earliest attestations.

== Esoteric connections ==

Cross and circle boards may suggest a variety of mystical, symbolic, or esoteric designs such as mandalas; sun and earth symbols; swastikas; or Celtic, Coptic, and Greek crosses. However, mere visual similarities do not prove a deeper connection; and demonstrating any historical connection has proven to be a slippery matter. Many modern discussions of the religious, magical, or divinatory genesis of board games stem from the work of Stewart Culin who postulated a single source: the &quot;classification of all things according to the Four Directions&quot; by means of divinatory arrows, and that &quot;[s]urvivals of these magical processes constitute our present games&quot; (including &quot;all&quot; dice, board, card, and domino games). He quotes, for example, an &quot;account of the Zuñi War Gods&quot; which explicitly links divination, the 4 quarters of the earth, and games. Nyout (Yut) and Native American games like Zohn Ahl are integral to his argument. However, later scholars have called into question our ability to assign historical precedence among randomizing activities such as divination, impartial decision-making, gambling, and game-playing, and elements of his monolithic genealogy of games have been called &quot;absurd&quot;.

Nevertheless, some historical connections are in evidence. E.g., in the 19th century, Yut stick dice were used for divination, with the results being looked up in a book not unlike the I Ching.

<doc id="1307278" wikidata="Q389948" url="?curid=1307278" title="Silver Meteor">
<text>The Silver Meteor is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak between New York City and Miami, Florida. Introduced in 1939 as the first diesel-powered streamliner between New York and Florida, it was the flagship train of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) and one of the flagship trains of its successor, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). The train was transferred to Amtrak when it took over intercity passenger rail service in 1971.

The train was part of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Service&quot; brand, along with its former sister train, the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, SAL&#x27;s other former flagship streamliner. The two trains were the remnants of the numerous long-distance trains that operated between New York and Florida for most of the 20th century. On November 10, 2024, Amtrak temporarily combined the and &quot;Silver Star&quot;, producing a Chicago–Washington–Miami route, the , leaving the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; as the only remaining New York–Florida passenger train.

During fiscal year 2024, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; carried 298,328 passengers, an increase of 5.1% from FY2023.

==History==
The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; was inaugurated by the SAL on February 2, 1939. The name was selected via contest, with 30 people among 76,000 entrants proposing the winning name. Utilizing EMC E4 diesel locomotives originally purchased for SAL&#x27;s flagship all-Pullman train, the &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;, it became the first diesel-powered streamliner to Florida. Its introduction later prompted SAL&#x27;s competitor, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL), to introduce its own New York-Florida streamliner, the &quot;Champion&quot;, on December 1, 1939. The SAL emphasized the train&#x27;s modernity, referring to it as the &quot;Train of Tomorrow&quot; and having its first trip to Florida begin not from New York Penn Station, but from the Long Island Rail Road station at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The original schedule took 25 hours.

The train used seven new cars manufactured by the Budd Company: a baggage-dormitory-coach, a diner straddled by two coaches on either side, and a coach-lounge-observation. The train was originally tri-weekly, alternating service between Miami and St. Petersburg every other day. However, the train proved so popular that after delivering new equipment, SAL upgraded the train to daily operation on both coasts in December 1939. Heavyweight sleeping cars would be added to the train in 1941, and would be upgraded to lightweight sleeping cars in 1947. Also in 1947, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; upgraded its end-of-train lounge car to a Budd-built tavern-lounge-observation car. In 1956, SAL introduced the Sun Lounge to the train. These cars included five double-bedrooms on one end and a lounge with glass panels on the roof. This was because full dome cars could not fit through the tunnels on the Northeast Corridor between New York and Washington D.C.

The Pennsylvania Railroad carried the train from New York to Washington along its mainline—now the Northeast Corridor—under a haulage agreement. Between Washington and Richmond, Virginia, it used the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, jointly owned by the SAL and five other railroads. South of Richmond, the train used SAL&#x27;s own mainline via Raleigh, North Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, and Ocala, Florida, and operated as train 57 southbound and train 58 northbound. At Wildwood, Florida, the train was split roughly in half into east and west coast sections. The east coast section continued to Miami and retained the tavern-observation car, and after 1956, the train&#x27;s Sun Lounge. The west coast section continued to Tampa and eventually St. Petersburg, operating as trains 157 southbound and 158 northbound. At Tampa, the train would be split again, with a small section containing a coach and a sleeper continuing to Venice via Sarasota as train 257 southbound and 258 northbound. This section&#x27;s small consist is primarily because from the mid-50s through June 1967, the Venice section was usually handled by SAL Motorcar 2028. 
The Seaboard Air Line Railroad merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967, and in 1968 the new railroad reshuffled the Florida streamliners. The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; lost its west coast section and began serving Miami only. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Transportation in 1968, which inherited the longstanding haulage agreement for the &quot;Silver Meteor.&quot; Amtrak retained the train when it took over most intercity passenger trains on May 1, 1971.

===Amtrak era===

From December 17, 1971, to April 15, 1972, and September 10, 1972, to April 27, 1973, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; bypassed Jacksonville, running over the Gross Cutoff between Gross near the Georgia state line and Baldwin. Between November 14, 1971, and January 16, 1972, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; made a major shift in its route, shifting from its traditional path on the old SAL mainline via Raleigh and Columbia to the old ACL mainline through Florence and Charleston, South Carolina. Between June 11 and September 10, 1972, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; was extended to Boston and called the Meteor. Service to St. Petersburg returned with the train splitting at Auburndale, Florida.

On several occasions during the 1970s, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; was combined with the &quot;Champion&quot;, the main rival of the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; until the SCL merger. In the summer of 1972, Amtrak split the trains in Savannah, with the &quot;Champion&quot; continuing to St. Petersburg and the &quot;Meteor&quot; continuing to Miami. They were combined again for the summers of 1975, 1976, and 1977, splitting in Jacksonville. Finally, in 1979, the &quot;Champion&quot; was permanently consolidated into the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; as its St. Petersburg section. Although the &quot;Champion&quot; name was preserved for a time, it disappeared with the October 1, 1979, timetable.

On September 30, 1979, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; was rerouted between Savannah and Jacksonville over the former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad route due to the abandonment of the old SAL route. On January 31, 1984, the &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; Florida west coast terminus was cut back from St. Petersburg to Tampa, ending almost 100 years of rail passenger service to St. Petersburg. By October 26, 1986, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; had shifted to the old ACL route north of Savannah, as the abandonment of the SAL route north of Raleigh affected only the &quot;Silver Star&quot;. On June 11, 1988, the tracks between Coleman and Auburndale, Florida were abandoned, then removed to create the General James A. Van Fleet State Trail, shifting the Miami section west to Lakeland.

By the end of 1988, the &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; Miami section had train numbers 97 and 98, while the Tampa section had train numbers 87 and 88. The Tampa section (87 and 88) was discontinued in 1994, and the Miami section (97 and 98) was rerouted through Orlando, and are still used today.

The best timing for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; between Miami and New York City was 27 hours in 2008; SAL&#x27;s first edition took 25 hours in 1939. Late trains often add more hours to today&#x27;s schedules, most often caused by freight delays.

In the January 2011 issue of &quot;Trains&quot; Magazine, this route was listed as one of five routes to be looked at by Amtrak in FY 2011, as the previous five routes (&quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Capitol&quot;, and &quot;Cardinal&quot;) were examined in FY 2010.

In October 2019, the &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; dining car discontinued serving freshly cooked meals in a traditional, restaurant-style setting, otherwise known as &quot;traditional dining.&quot; Amtrak introduced the &quot;flexible dining&quot; system to the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, which includes pre-prepared meals heated in either a convection oven or a microwave oven at the time of purchase. In a Rail Passengers Association webinar that took place on November 16, 2022, Amtrak&#x27;s vice president of long-distance service revealed that traditional dining service was planned to be reintroduced on the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and the &quot;Silver Star&quot; in early 2023. Following this announcement, beginning on northbound train 92 on March 15, 2023, traditional dining was reintroduced to the &quot;Silver Star&quot; in the form of a 3-month pilot program gauged to test the success of the service. Southbound train 91 received the pilot on March 17. On June 24, 2023, traditional dining service was formally launched on the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; on northbound train 98, and the pilot program on the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was replaced by a permanent service. Southbound train 97 received traditional dining on June 26. However, coach passengers were not allowed access to the dining car on either the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; or &quot;Silver Star&quot;, unlike on Amtrak&#x27;s western long-distance trains. Shortly after the formal rollout in another interview with the Rail Passengers Association, Amtrak&#x27;s vice president of long-distance service stated that Coach Class access to the dining car was planned to be allowed by the end of 2023, however by January 2024 coach passengers still did not have access. On March 4, 2024, dining car access was finally expanded to coach passengers, mirroring service on Amtrak&#x27;s western long-distance trains.

Since 2012, issues have prevented Amtrak from moving from their current station to the Miami Intermodal Center (MIC), primarily regarding the length of the platforms and lease agreements. Amtrak argued that the platforms were insufficient in length, as extra cars are normally added to the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; during the winter season to accommodate increased demand. Tri-Rail began serving the MIC on April 5, 2015, and Greyhound began using the station on June 24, 2015. Amtrak had been expected to move to the MIC by the Fall of 2016, but in 2018 Amtrak rejected the terms of a lease agreement with FDOT and said it had no plans to move to the MIC. In 2021, Amtrak reached out to FDOT to begin negotiations again for utilization of the MIC, and in February 2022, negotiations officially restarted. Later in March 2022, a test train operated into and out of the station and proved that the platforms are sufficient in length to hold a standard 10 car train. However, the platforms are not long enough to accommodate an 11 to 12 car train, which could be possible in the winter months. In September 2022, Amtrak management announced that it had restarted lease negotiations with FDOT regarding the use and maintenance of the terminal. However, one issue is the deadheading move that will need to occur between the MIC and Hialeah. Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner stated, &quot;The company is evaluating technical and operational aspects of the move.&quot; In an Amtrak Public Board Meeting Q&amp;A on December 1, 2022, it was revealed that Amtrak was in the final stages of its preparations for relocating from their current Miami station, and had planned to relocate to the MIC in 2023. However, additional track area would need to be constructed for the Amtrak trains to turn back north, and by 2024 Amtrak had no date indicated for when service will start at the MIC. Amtrak then unexpectedly reversed course in December 2024, sending a short letter to transportation officials negotiating the station lease&#x27;s final details. The letter said Amtrak was no longer interested in running trains to the station and had determined that operating its trains from the station would be too expensive.

On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the Chicago–Washington–Miami , leaving the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; as the only New York City–Miami route.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
On July 6, 2020, Amtrak reduced the frequency of this train to four times per week as opposed to daily due to the impact of ridership from the worldwide COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic. Southbound &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; trains departed New York Monday through Thursday, while &quot;Silver Star&quot; trains departed Friday through Sunday. Similarly, northbound &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; trains departed Miami Sunday through Wednesday, while &quot;Silver Star&quot; trains departed Miami on Thursday through Saturday. Both trains resumed daily services on June 7, 2021, after additional Amtrak funding was included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

From January 24 to October 14, 2022, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; was suspended due to the Omicron variant surge of the coronavirus pandemic and its effect on staffing and equipment availability. During this period, the &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; sister train, the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, continued to operate. Additional coach and sleeping car capacity was added to the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, creating a train that carried as many as six coaches and five sleepers. During this period, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; provided once-daily service to stations normally served by trains between New York and Rocky Mount, NC, and Savannah and Miami. Furthermore, a stop was temporarily added at Jesup, Georgia, usually only served by the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;. Once-daily service remained available to &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; stations between Rocky Mount, North Carolina and Savannah via the daily daytime &quot;Palmetto&quot;, which operates between New York and Savannah. The &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; resumption date was pushed back a total of six times. Originally scheduled to return on March 27, it was pushed back to May 23, September 11, and finally, October 3. However, Hurricane Ian caused extensive damage to the Central Florida Rail Corridor in late September, which Amtrak uses to get to central and southern Florida. In response, Amtrak pushed the suspension back to October 6, then to October 11, and finally to October 14 after the full extent of the damage became apparent.

==Equipment==

The original &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; used lightweight cars built by the Budd Company. Three consists were needed for a daily train between New York and Miami; each had a baggage-dormitory-coach (22 seats), three 60-seat coaches, a tavern-lounge-coach (30 seats), a dining car, and a coach-observation-lounge (48 seats). The Pennsylvania Railroad owned some of the coaches. Budd delivered more cars in November–December 1940, allowing daily service to St. Petersburg: three baggage-dormitory-coaches (18 seats), seven 56-seat coaches, two dining cars, and three coach-buffet-observation cars (30 seats).

By the early 1960s, the SAL&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; typically had 17 cars or more, consisting of nine Pullman sleeping cars, including its highly touted glass-topped Sun Lounge introduced in 1956, several coaches, two dining cars, and an observation car with a tavern and lounge. The train began using rebuilt Heritage Fleet equipment in 1981.

The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; now uses Amtrak&#x27;s standard long-distance single-level equipment: Viewliner baggage cars, Viewliner sleeping cars, Viewliner dining cars, Amfleet café-lounges and Amfleet coaches. An ACS-64 electric locomotive is used between New York City and Washington, D.C., while two diesel-electric locomotives, either GE P42DC or Siemens ALC-42 locomotives, are used for power south of Washington, D.C. Amtrak began replacing the older P42DC locomotives with ALC-42 locomotives in 2023.

A typical &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; consist as of January 2025 is made up of:

* ACS-64 locomotive (New York–Washington)
* P42DC or ALC-42 locomotive (Washington–Miami)
* P42DC or ALC-42 locomotive (Washington–Miami)
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Café/Lounge Car
* Viewliner II Dining Car
* Viewliner I/II Sleeping Car
* Viewliner I/II Sleeping Car
* Viewliner I/II Sleeping Car
* Viewliner II Baggage Car

==Route details==

The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; operates over a combination of Amtrak and CSX Transportation trackage:
* New York – Washington D.C. (Amtrak)
** Northeast Corridor: 
* Washington D.C. – DeLand, Florida (CSXT)
** RF&amp;P Subdivision
** Richmond Terminal Subdivision
** North End Subdivision
** South End Subdivision
** Charleston Subdivision
** Savannah Subdivision
** Nahunta Subdivision
** Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision
** Sanford Subdivision 
* DeLand - Poinciana, Florida (SunRail)
** Central Florida Rail Corridor
* Poinciana - Mangonia Park, Florida (CSXT)
** Carters Subdivision
** Auburndale Subdivision
** Miami Subdivision
* Mangonia Park - Miami, Florida (Tri-Rail)
** South Florida Rail Corridor

The &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; uses the same route as the between Washington and Miami save for two segments: Selma, North Carolina – Savannah, Georgia, and Kissimmee, Florida – Winter Haven, Florida. Between Selma and Savannah, the &quot;Floridian&quot; travels inland over the CSX S-Line to serve the Carolinas&#x27; state capitals of Raleigh and Columbia, while the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; travels closer to the coast on the CSX A-Line and serves Fayetteville, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. Between Kissimmee and Winter Haven, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; turns south to go directly to Miami at Auburndale, Florida, while the &quot;Floridian&quot; continues west to Lakeland, Florida and Tampa before coming back to Auburndale and turning south to Miami. In addition to these diversions, between Sebring, Florida and West Palm Beach, Florida, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; makes no intermediate stops, while the &quot;Floridian&quot; makes an additional stop at Okeechobee, Florida. Inversely, between Savannah and Jacksonville, Florida, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; makes an additional stop at Jesup, Georgia, while the &quot;Floridian&quot; makes no intermediate stops. The daytime &quot;Palmetto&quot; operates from New York to Savannah over the same route as the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, allowing cities in the Carolinas and Virginia on the route of the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; to have service during the day.

In its present form, the southbound &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; leaves New York in mid-afternoon, arriving in Washington at dinner time and traveling overnight through Virginia and the Carolinas for arrival at breakfast time the following morning in Savannah, rush hour in Jacksonville, lunchtime in Orlando, and early evening in Miami. Northbound trains leave Miami just before rush hour, arriving in central Florida at lunchtime and Jacksonville in the late afternoon and dinner time in Savannah, then passing through the Carolinas and Virginia overnight for arrival at breakfast-time in Washington, mid-morning in Philadelphia and lunchtime in New York.

Like other long-distance trains operating on the Northeast Corridor, local travel between NEC stations is prohibited on the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;. Northbound trains only stop to discharge passengers from Alexandria, Virginia northward, and southbound trains only stop to receive passengers from Newark, New Jersey to Washington. This policy is in place to keep seats available for passengers making more extended trips. Passengers wanting to travel locally must use the more frequent &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; or &quot;Acela&quot; trains. Additionally, the &quot;Silver Meteor,&quot; like the &quot;Floridian,&quot; does not allow local travel between West Palm Beach and Miami. Southbound trains only discharge passengers, while northbound trains only stop to receive passengers bound for points beyond West Palm Beach. This is due to the availability of Tri-Rail, South Florida&#x27;s commuter rail system.

<text>Feilian () or () is a Chinese wind spirit from a southern tradition, later identified with and subsumed under the primary wind deity Fengbo. Feilian has also been identified with a late Shang dynasty minister as well as with the mythical phoenix bird, and retained a separate identity as a mythical creature after losing its status as master of the wind.

==Concept==
===Southern origin===
Feilian is first attested in the influential poem &quot;Li sao&quot; by Qu Yuan, wherein Feilian assists the poet in part of his mystical journey. This work comes from Chu, a Zhou dynasty state which was on the periphery of the Zhou cultural sphere, and is typically dated to the 300s or 200s . Wang Yi, who collated and annotated the transmitted &quot;Chu ci&quot; collection centuries later, annotates this mention of Feilian with the text &quot;Feilian is Fengbo&quot;, which demonstrates that the various wind spirits were already being systematised under a single identity. Wang Yi goes on to explain that in order to ride a dragon through the clouds as the &quot;Li sao&quot; narrator does, one must borrow the strength of &quot;jifeng&quot; (). This term &quot;jifeng&quot; acts as a gloss for Feilian in the &quot;Shiji&quot;. According to Deng Xiaohua (), &quot;fēilián&quot; (Old Chinese: ZS &quot;*pɯl-ɡ·rem&quot;; B&amp;S &quot;*Cə.pə[r]*(k-)[r]em&quot;), might be a dialectal variant of (OC: ZS &quot;*plum&quot;; B&amp;S &quot;*prəm&quot;) &quot;wind&quot;. This same relationship was explored by Tôdô in 1959. Sun Zuoyun&#x27;s () influential 1943 study of Feilian argues that the term &quot;feilian&quot; was an alternative written representation of the sound in Old Chinese that was the pronunciation of . Feilian appears twice more in the &quot;Chu ci&quot; collection: once in &quot;Jiu bian&quot; and once in &quot;Yuan you&quot;, each time as a helpful spirit assisting the narrator.

===Evolution===
Early Chinese wind spirits were many. The Shang had the masters of the four directions, an eastern tradition had the naturalistic &quot;Great Wind&quot; (), another tradition considered the winnowing basket constellation (箕星, comprising four stars in Sagittarius) as the controller of the winds, the south had Feilian, and theorists have speculated that a number of named mythical birds from early Chinese culture – including the phoenix and the great &quot;peng&quot; bird () of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; – should be considered originally to have been wind spirits. The Zhou culture had two competing wind spirits: Fengshi and Fengbo, the latter of whom would end up subsuming all these traditions, and lives on in the Taoist pantheon as Fang Daozhang ().

In Feilian&#x27;s identity as Fengbo, he carries wind with him in a bag and stirs up trouble. Feilian is kept in check by Houyi, the heavenly archer and Shang legendary culture hero. Feilian has become attached to the later mythology of the Yellow Emperor, against whom he contended under the leadership of Chiyou.

Before consolidation into the Fengbo entity, Feilian was also thought to be able to grant immortality. Emperor Wu of Han (141–87 ) believed this sufficiently to order the construction of several buildings dedicated to Feilian worship in pursuit of this gift of eternal life. In the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;, Feilian is mentioned as a creature one can ride astride into the world of spirits where nothing perishes.

===As an individual===
In histories of the consolidation of the Zhou conquest of Shang, the Duke of Zhou pursued Shang king Di Xin&#x27;s minister Feilian to the seacoast and killed him there. This episode is narrated in the &quot;Mengzi&quot; as well as the excavated text &quot;Xinian&quot;, part of the Qinghua University bamboo slips collection, a product of Chu provisionally dated around 370 . According to the &quot;Shiji&quot;, which carries a not dissimilar account, Feilian&#x27;s descendants would later found the state of Qin. Various theories have attempted to explain how the name Feilian was attached both to an individual minister at the end of the Shang dynasty and a Chu cultural wind spirit.

==Form==
Modern English language sources state Feilian is a winged dragon with the head of a deer and the tail of a snake. Hawkes states Feilian is commonly depicted as a winged deer, but it can encompass a multiplicity of different winged creatures.

Commentary to the &quot;Shiji&quot; provide earlier textual depictions. Where Emperor Wu of Han ordered the construction of buildings dedicated to Feilian worship, Eastern Han commentator Ying Shao defined Feilian as a sacred beast, able to control the winds. Jin dynasty commentator Jin Zhuo provided a more detailed description, saying Feilian had a deer&#x27;s body with a bird&#x27;s head, horns, and a snake&#x27;s tail, with markings like a leopard&#x27;s spots. Similarly, in the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;, where Feilian is ridden like a horse in the world outside the world, Eastern Han commentator Gao You states that Feilian is the name of a winged beast with long fur. Western Han rhapsodist Sima Xiangru&#x27;s &quot;Shang lin fu&quot; () mentions Feilian next to another mythical creature, the &quot;xiezhi&quot; (). In annotation, Eastern Jin dynasty commentator Guo Pu equates Feilian with the &quot;dragon sparrow&quot; (), saying it has the head of a deer and the body of a bird, in a neat inversion of Jin Zhuo&#x27;s roughly contemporaneous description.

===As other mythical creatures===
Sun Zuoyun expanded upon his reconstruction of &quot;feilian&quot; as an alternative written representation of the word , using the fact that it was often used to write the word since the graphical forms had not yet differentiated, to identify Feilian with the mythical phoenix. He went on to claim that several Han dynasty stone mortuary figures from Luoyang and Ya&#x27;an, all with wings, horns, claws, and feathers, should be understood as representing the Feilian. During the Shang dynasty, the word for &quot;phoenix&quot; was sometimes written using the words for &quot;deer&quot; and &quot;long-tailed bird&quot; squished together into a single glyph; a direct reflection of the Feilian&#x27;s chimeric appearance.

Lin Tongyan argues that given the first character of the term &quot;feilian&quot; () means &quot;flying&quot;, and the second character () is pronounced similarly to , Feilian should be conceptualised as a type of &quot;qilin&quot; capable of winged flight.

<text>The Sukhona () is a river in the European part of Russia, a tributary of the Northern Dvina. The course of the Sukhona lies in Ust-Kubinsky, Sokolsky, Mezhdurechensky, Totemsky, Tarnogsky, Nyuksensky, and Velikoustyugsky Districts of Vologda Oblast in Russia. It is long, and the area of its basin . The Sukhona joins the Yug near the town of Veliky Ustyug, forming the Northern Dvina, one of the biggest rivers of European Russia.

The biggest tributaries of the Sukhona are the Vologda (right), the Lezha (right), the Pelshma (left), the Dvinitsa (left), the Tolshma (right), the Tsaryova (left), the Uftyuga (left), and the Gorodishna (right).

== Etymology ==
According to the Max Vasmer&#x27;s Etymological Dictionary, the name of the river originates from the Russian and most likely means &quot;a river with a dry (hard) bottom&quot;.

==Physical geography==
The river basin of the Sukhona comprises vast areas in the central and eastern parts of Vologda Oblast, in the south of Arkhangelsk Oblast, and in the north of Kostroma Oblast. In particular, the city of Vologda is located in the river basin of the Sukhona. The basin also includes Lake Kubenskoye, one of the biggest lakes of Vologda Oblast. The river basin is bounded from the south by the western part of the Northern Ridge, which separates the basins of the Sukhona and the Kostroma. From the north, the Sukhona river basin is bounded in the western part by the Kharovsk Ridge hill chain which separates it from the river basin of the Vaga.

The towns of Sokol, Totma, and Veliky Ustyug, as well as the villages and district centers Shuyskoye and Nyuksenitsa, are located on the banks of the Sukhona.

The source of the Sukhona is in the south-eastern part of Lake Kubenskoye. The Sukhona flows out in the south-eastern direction, accepts the Vologda and the Lezha from the right and turns northeast. Most of the river course runs over hilly landscape with tall banks. The Sukhona freezes up in late October - November and stays under the ice until late April - early May.

==Navigation and canals==
The Sukhona is navigable, but there is no passenger navigation except for ferry crossings. The lower course of the Kubena and Lake Kubenskoye are navigable as well. The northern part of Lake Kubenskoye, which belongs to the basin of the Sukhona, is connected by Northern Dvina Canal with the town of Kirillov and the Sheksna, thus connecting the basins of the White Sea and the Volga. In the 19th century, the canal and Lake Kubenskoye were the main waterway connecting the Volga with the White Sea. However, in the 1930s the White Sea – Baltic Canal was built, and the Northern Dvina Canal lost its significance. The canal is still in operation, serving cargo traffic and occasional cruise ships, which then proceed to Lake Kubenskoye.

== History ==
The area was populated by Finnic peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic, with the exception was Veliky Ustyug, which was part of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. Totma has been first mentioned in the chronicles in 1137, and Veliky Ustyug — in 1207. In the 13th century the Novgorod merchants already reached the White Sea. The area was attractive in the first instance because of the fur trading. The main waterway from Novgorod into the Northern Dvina was along the Volga and its tributary, the Sheksna, along the Slavyanka into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa into Lake Kubenskoye and further to the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina.

Until the 1700s, Arkhangelsk was the main trading harbour for the sea trade of Russia and Western Europe, and the Sukhona was on the main trading route connecting the central Russia with Arkhangelsk. Peter the Great drastically changed the situation, by founding Saint-Petersburg in 1703, thus opening the way for the Baltic Sea trade, and by constructing the highway between Saint-Petersburg and Arkhangelsk via Kargopol. The river quickly lost its role as the leading trading route, which was accelerated by the construction of the railway between Vologda and Arkhangelsk between 1894 and 1897.

<text>Ravi Kichlu () (December 24, 1932 – September 1993), popularly known as Pandit Ravi Kichlu, was a prominent classical Hindustani vocalist of Agra gharana, who formed a well-known duo with his brother Vijay Kichlu. He studied Dhrupad under the Dagar Brothers, Ustad Moinuddin and Ustad Aminuddin Dagar and was later a &#x27;shagird&#x27; of Ustad Latafat Hussain Khan, a doyen of the Agra Gharana. He thus imbibed a unique style, a mix of &#x27;Dagar Bani&#x27; and Agra &#x27;Gharana&#x27;. Pandit Ravi Kichlu was well known not only as a classical vocalist, but as a leading exponent of semi classical and folk forms - such as Thumri, Dadra, Kajri, Chaiti - and a collection of Ghazals, the music of which he composed himself.

<text>Samtskhe–Javakheti (, , ) is a region (mkhare) in southern Georgia with a population of 147.400 (2023) and an area of . The region has Akhaltsikhe as its administrative center. Samtskhe–Javakheti is made up of the historical Georgian provinces Meskheti, Javakheti and Tori.

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the South Caucasus natural gas pipeline, and the Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway pass through the region.

The population of the region is made up of Georgians and Armenians, as well as smaller numbers of Russians.

== Geography ==

Samtskhe–Javakheti borders Adjara and Guria in the northwestern tip, Imereti in the north, Shida Kartli in the northeast and Kvemo Kartli in the east. The southern border is formed by Armenia, the southwestern flank borders Turkey. The region covers the Javakheti Plateau, a highland of volcanic origin and the northern extension of the Armenian highlands. The plains are between 1500 and 2000 meters above sea level. Samtskhe–Javakheti is bordered by several mountain ranges, the most important being the Meskheti Range and Trialeti Range in the north and the Samsari Range and Javakheti Range in the east.

The highlands are home to some of Georgia&#x27;s largest lakes, such as Paravani Lake, Tabatskuri Lake, Khanchali Lake and Kartsakhi Lake. Georgia&#x27;s largest river, the Mtkvari, flows through the region from Turkey, a few miles north of Kartsakhi Lake. The river has carved a canyon through in the highlands and forms the eastern boundary of the Erusheti Highlands, a mountain range along the border with Turkey. In this gorge the large historic cave monastery Vardzia is situated, an important tourist attraction. The river flows initially in a northwesterly direction through the gorge to Akhaltsikhe via Khertvisi Fortress where the Paravani River joins the Mtkvari. The river gorge has a depth of approximately 500 meters. At Akhaltsikhe the river turns to the northeast and streams to Borjomi between the Meskheti Range (left bank) and Trialeti Range (right bank), after which the river leaves the region through the Shida Kartli plain.

Due to its high location, the region has cold and snowy winters. In the northern situated Bakuriani, not far from the tourist attraction Borjomi, there is a ski resort.

==History==

The current division of Georgia into &quot;regions&quot; (&quot;Mkhare&quot;) was introduced by the Shevardnadze government in the mid-1990s, partly as a response to the secession of Abkhazia and the South Ossetia conflict. Samtskhe–Javakheti was basically formed by combining the two traditional provinces of Meskheti (Samtskhe) and Javakheti.

===Meskheti===
The ancient tribes of Meskhi (or Moschi) and Mosiniks are the first known inhabitants of the area. Some scholars credit the Mosiniks (or &quot;Mossynoeci&quot;) with the invention of iron metallurgy. From the 2nd millennium to the 4th century BC, Meskheti was believed to be part of the Kingdom of Diauehi, in the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD part of the Kingdom of Iberia. From the 10th to the 15th century it was part of the united Georgian Kingdom. In the 16th century Meskheti was integrated into the Safavid Empire, followed by the Ottoman Empire. After the conclusion of the Russo-Persian War of 1826-28, it was a part of Russian Tiflis Governorate from 1817 till 1829, from 1918 to 1921 part of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, and from 1921 to 1990 part of the Georgian SSR. After independence from the USSR Meskheti was reinstalled as a province of Georgia, and later cast into the new Samtskhe–Javakheti region.

===Javakheti===
In ancient sources, the region was recorded as &quot;Zabakha&quot; in 785 BC, by the king Argishti I of Urartu. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Javakheti was part of the Iberian duchy of Tsunda from the 4th or 3rd century BC. Saint Nino entered Iberia from Javakheti, and, following the course of the River Kura, she arrived in Mtskheta, the capital of the kingdom, once there, she eventually began to preach Christianity, which culminated by Christianization of Iberia.

In struggle against the Arab occupation, Bagrationi dynasty came to rule over Tao-Klarjeti and established the Kouropalatate of Iberia. rulers of Tao-Klarjeti fought the Arabs from there, gradually incorporating the surrounding lands of Samtskhe and Javakheti, along with a few other lesser lands, from the Arab dominance. For a long time the region became a cultural safe-house and one of the most important religious centers of Georgia.

In the mid-10th century, Javakheti was incorporated into Kingdom of Abkhazia. In 964 Leon III of Abkhazia extended his influence to Javakheti, during his reign was built Kumurdo Cathedral. In subsequent centuries, Javakheti was integral part of unified Georgian monarchy and had a period of significant development: lot of bridges, churches, monasteries, and royal residences (Lgivi, Ghrtila, Bozhano, Vardzia) were built. From the 11th century, the center of upper Javakheti became Akhalkalaki. From the 10th century, the center of lowland Javakheti was Tmogvi. From the 12th century, the domain was ruled by representatives of the feudal family of Toreli.

In the 15th century, Javakheti was incorporated to principality of Samtskhe-Saatabago. In the 16th century, the region, as well as the adjacent territories of western Georgia, was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. The Georgian population of Javakheti was displaced to inner regions of Georgia such as Imereti and Kartli. Those who remained gradually became Muslim.

As a result of the struggles of the Russian Empire with the Ottomans, Russian authorities settled Christian Armenians and Caucasus Greeks in the area after 1828. Armenian refugees from the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire came in the early 20th century. Also a large number of Russian Doukhobor sect members settled the region.

=== Soviet era ===
Georgia came fully under Soviet control in 1921, after the Red Army invasion of Georgia. The remaining Muslim minority in Meskheti, also known as &quot;Meskhetian Turks&quot;, were deported in cattle-trucks to Central Asia by order of Stalin and settled within an area that overlaps the boundaries of the modern nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Today, many are still dispersed across those countries. Of the 100,000 forcibly deported, as many as 30,000-50,000 perished.

==Tourist attractions==
The major tourist attractions are the cave monasteries of Vardzia (which was founded by Queen Tamar in 1185), Vanis Kvabebi (which dates from the 8th century), Rabati Castle and Khertvisi Fortress. Also, among national visitors is very popular 10th century Sapara Monastery, Tmogvi fortress, and 8th century Zarzma monastery.

<doc id="1307315" wikidata="Q7915123" url="?curid=1307315" title="Vannie Higgins">
<text>Charles &quot;Vannie&quot; Higgins (1897 – June 19, 1932) was a New York mobster and one of the most prominent bootleggers during the Prohibition era. Known as &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Last Irish Boss&quot;, Higgins was notorious for his escapes from law enforcement.

==Early life and Prohibition==
Higgins was born in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York in 1897. Learning pickpocketing and petty theft as a child, by 1916, he had been arrested for assault twice but was put on probation. At the beginning of Prohibition he had formed a small-time gang which started to operate outside of Bay Ridge after taking control of &quot;Big Bill&quot; Bill Dwyer&#x27;s bootlegging operations with partner Frank Costello in 1927, importing high quality Canadian liquor for Dwyer&#x27;s high-society clientele.

By the mid-1920s, Higgins&#x27; rum-running operations included a fleet of taxis and loading trucks, as well as several planes and numerous speedboats which were used in smuggling alcohol into the United States from Canada (one of which, the &quot;Cigarette&quot;, was described as &quot;the fastest rum-runner in New York waters&quot;). Higgins, himself a flying enthusiast and licensed pilot, often used his planes for personal use. During a business trip in Baltimore, Higgins was a witness to a gang fight between rival bootleggers while visiting a local speakeasy and, while deciding to leave the premises, he was mistaken for one of the fighting bootleggers and shot in the leg by a local police officer.

==Manhattan bootleg wars==
Higgins soon began moving into Manhattan, where he would come into conflict with Dutch Schultz and during the Manhattan Beer War, aligned himself with Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond, Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll, and Anthony &quot;Little Augie Pisano&quot; Carfano against Schultz.

Higgins reportedly stated &quot;I don&#x27;t let my boys take risks I don&#x27;t take.&quot; at the scene of many gun battles between himself and Schultz during 1928. During one such incident, Higgins and gunman William &quot;Bad Bill&quot; Bailey were seen fleeing the scene after fighting rival gunmen at Brooklyn&#x27;s Owl Head Cafe at 69th Street and Third Avenue in which a patrolman Daniel J Maloney was killed in the crossfire by fellow arriving police officers in March 1929.

Higgins, Bailey and another gunman were arrested several weeks later in connection with the death of Brooklyn bootlegger Samuel Orlando, identified by witnesses as the rival gangsters who had gunned Orlando down. By the time of his trial, however, none of the witnesses could be found and he was acquitted of all charges.

Several months later, Higgins and Bailey were shot at in an attempted drive-by shooting by rival gunmen, although the two, driving in another car at the time of the attack, were able to escape their pursuers.

A colorful character in public life, Higgins made public appearances and often posed for news photographers, as he dressed in expensive British imported suits and was driven around in various limousines. Although almost always surrounded by bodyguards, Higgins had earned a reputation for recklessness in gang battles as his offices and residence were known to be well-stocked with weapons. When Higgins acquired a shipment of grenades from a military arsenal, he and &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond used them against Schulz&#x27;s speakeasies during their battles with the rival gangster.

Enjoying extensive political protection from many of New York&#x27;s politicians and public officials, Higgins was allowed to land his plane at the state prison of Comstock, New York, where he had dinner with childhood friend Warden Joseph H. Wilson. Although Wilson was criticized by then-New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wilson maintained he had the right to entertain anyone he wanted.

In 1931, Higgins led his men into the Manhattan&#x27;s Blossom Heath Inn on West 57th Street, where he visited the owner, Frank McManus (McManus was the brother of George &quot;Hump&quot; McManus, a suspect in the 1928 murder of Arnold Rothstein). When Higgins refused to leave, arguing with the owner over a shipment of beer and liquor, a fight broke out in which Higgins suffered serious knife wounds. Although taken to Polyclinic Hospital, Higgins refused to identify his attacker while recuperating.

Later that year, Higgins and Bailey were suspected in the death of Robert &quot;Whitey&quot; Benson, a member of Higgins&#x27; organization who was suspected of secretly working for rival Dutch Schultz and informing him on information regarding Higgins&#x27; organization, including details on liquor shipments. Although arrested for the murder, the two were once again acquitted due to lack of evidence.

==Death==
On the night of June 18, 1932, after attending his daughter&#x27;s tap dance recital at the Knights of Columbus clubhouse in Prospect Park, Higgins was gunned down in the street while trying to protect his 7-year-old daughter. He was taken to the Methodist Episcopal Hospital by a local patrolman and, despite police attempts to question him, Higgins refused to answer any questions regarding the shooting and died the following afternoon.

In his Letters to Jack Conroy, 1926–1990, Frank Mead mentions that Higgins was a 2nd. cousin : &quot;A relative of mine (2nd. cousin), by name Vannie Higgins, was machine-gunned to death in Brooklyn when the syndicate got going good.&quot;

==Legacy==
In recent years another mysterious death has been ascribed to Higgins. The British criminal historian, Jonathan Goodman did a thorough study of the death of Starr Faithfull, whose body was found on the beach at Long Beach, Nassau County, New York, on 8 June 1931. Although Faithfull&#x27;s cause of death was determined to be drowning, it was unclear whether the death was a homicide, suicide, or accident. As the weeks passed and the story was stripped by the newspapers, it turned out Starr&#x27;s life was a tangle due to sexual mistreatment as a teenager by her mother&#x27;s cousin, Mayor Andrew Peters of Boston. Peters (best recalled as the Mayor during the 1919 Boston Police Strike) kept the sexual relationship going for years, and paid the mother and stepfather of Starr money for their silence. Starr was also interested in other men, including a steamship physician, Dr. George Jameson Carr. But Carr appeared to be breaking the relationship off. So there
was a strong possibility that Starr committed suicide.

Goodman discovered that Higgins had learned that Starr had an irregular sexual relationship with Peters, and her family had been extorting money from this Mayor. Goodman concluded that Higgins had Starr kidnapped and driven to Island Park, Long Island, where he tried to force her to divulge details of her affair with Peters. He was unsatisfied with her answers, and beat her. Thinking he had beaten her to death, he ordered the body dumped. However, Faithfull was still alive when she was thrown into the ocean, because her cause of death was drowning.

<text>Marvel Next was a short lived imprint that was launched by the American comics publisher Marvel Comics in early 2005. Marvel&#x27;s press release stated that Marvel Next was &quot;not a new line or imprint&quot; but rather &quot;a collection of titles&quot; intended to &quot;spotlight young characters.&quot; Like the Tsunami imprint before it, it aimed to attract young readers. Marvel Next titles carried a &quot;Marvel Next&quot; tag on the cover, but not always in the typical imprint location near the regular Marvel logo. The title may have been an attempt to appeal to or identify with Generation Next.

The titles were set in the Marvel Universe and most of them (&quot;Araña: The Heart of the Spider&quot;, &quot;Young Avengers&quot;, &quot;Runaways&quot; and &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;) had connections to pre-existing titles, taking advantage of settings, characters and events from previous stories.

==Logo Use==
While the Marvel Next press release included &quot;Young Avengers&quot; and &quot;Runaways&quot; among the forthcoming Marvel Next books, neither series ever carried the Marvel Next logo. Of the series that did carry it, only &quot;X-23&quot; and &quot;Araña Heart of the Spider&quot; displayed it for their entire runs. The logo was used from March 2005 through February 2006, exactly matching the run of &quot;Araña&quot;, imprint&#x27;s longest lasting series.

==Marvel Next titles==

===Ongoing (with logo on at least some issues)===
*&quot;Araña: The Heart of the Spider&quot;
*&quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;

<doc id="1307322" wikidata="Q4748907" url="?curid=1307322" title="Amtrak Thruway">
<text>Amtrak Thruway is a system of through-ticketed transportation services to connect passengers with areas not served by Amtrak trains. In most cases these are dedicated motorcoach routes, but can also be non-dedicated intercity bus services, transit buses, vans, taxis, ferry boats and commuter rail trains.

Train and Thruway tickets are typically purchased together from Amtrak for the length of a passenger&#x27;s journey and connections are timed for guaranteed transfers between the two services.

In addition to providing connecting service to unserved areas, some Thruway services operate as redundant service along passenger rail corridors to add extra capacity.

== History and purpose ==
Amtrak operates the Thruway network to extend the reach of its train services, offering connections to destinations not directly served by Amtrak trains. The earliest incarnation of such a service was launched in January 1973, to provide a connection between Amtrak&#x27;s Inter-American in Laredo, Texas, and the Aztec Eagle train run by N de M from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The following year, Amtrak launched an agreement with Greyhound allowing for passengers to buy combined bus and rail tickets for connecting services run by the two companies. These services were the predecessors of Thruway Motorcoach. The first Amtrak bus service to bear the name &quot;Amtrak Thruway&quot; was launched in California in 1993. Amtrak launched a significant expansion of Thruway Motorcoach services across the United States in 2014.

<doc id="1307328" wikidata="Q812569" url="?curid=1307328" title="Baynard's Castle">
<text>Baynard&#x27;s Castle refers to buildings on two neighbouring sites in the City of London, between where Blackfriars station and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral now stand. The first was a Norman fortification constructed by Ralph Baynard ( 1086), 1st feudal baron of Little Dunmow in Essex, and was demolished by King John in 1213. The second was a medieval palace built a short distance to the south-east and later extended, but mostly destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. According to Sir Walter Besant, &quot;There was no house in [London] more interesting than this&quot;. 

The original castle was built at the point where the old Roman walls and River Fleet met the River Thames, just east of what is now Blackfriars Station. The north wall of the castle used as its foundation the Roman-era river wall from the 3rd century, distinguished by a tile-course of Roman brick. The Norman castle stood for over a century before being demolished by King John in 1213. It appears to have been rebuilt after the Barons&#x27; Revolt, but the site was sold in 1276 to form the precinct of the great Blackfriars&#x27; Monastery.

About a century later, a new mansion was constructed on land that had been reclaimed from the Thames, south-east of the first castle. The house was rebuilt after 1428, and became the London headquarters of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses. The accession of King Edward IV was agreed and proclaimed in the castle on 3 March 1461.

The house was reconstructed as a royal palace by King Henry VII (1485–1509) at the end of the 15th century, and his son Henry VIII gave it to Katherine of Aragon on the eve of their wedding. In 1551, after Henry&#x27;s death in 1547 and during the reign of King Edward VI, the house was granted to Earl of Pembroke (1501–1570), brother-in-law of Henry&#x27;s widow, Queen Katherine Parr. Pembroke built a large extension around a second courtyard in about 1551. The Herbert family took the side of Parliament in the English Civil War, and after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy the house was occupied by Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury, a Royalist. Baynard&#x27;s Castle was left in ruins after the Great Fire of London in 1666, although fragments survived into the 19th century. The site is now occupied by a BT office called Baynard House and the castle is commemorated by Castle Baynard Street and the Castle Baynard Ward of the City of London.

==Norman castle==
Today the River Fleet has been reduced to a trickle in a culvert under New Bridge Street that emerges under Blackfriars Bridge, but before the modern development of London it was the largest river in the area after the Thames. It formed the western boundary of the Roman city of London, and the strategic importance of the junction of the Fleet and the Thames means that the area was probably fortified from early times.

Richard of Cirencester suggests that King Canute spent Christmas at such a fort in 1017, where he had Eadric Streona executed. Some accounts claim this was triggered by an argument over a game of chess; Historian William Page suggests that Eadric held the fort as Ealdorman of Mercia and after his death it may have been granted to Osgod Clapa, who was a &quot;staller&quot;, a standard-bearer and representative of the king (see Privileges section).

This fort was apparently rebuilt after the 1066 Norman Conquest of England by Ralph Baynard, a follower of William the Conqueror and Sheriff of Essex. It was on the river-bank inside the Roman walls; a second Norman fort, Montfichet&#x27;s Tower, stood to the north.

The site of Baynard&#x27;s Castle was adjacent to the church of St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe, on the southern side of today&#x27;s 160 Queen Victoria Street (the former &quot;Times&quot; office and now The Bank of New York Mellon Centre); archaeologists have found fortifications stretching at least south, onto the site of the proposed development at 2 Puddle Dock. This may be the &quot;Bainiardus&quot; mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 who gave his name to springs near Paddington called Baynard&#x27;s Watering, later shortened to Bayswater.

The castle was inherited by Ralph Baynard&#x27;s son Geoffrey and his grandson William Baynard, but the latter forfeited his lands early in the reign of Henry I (1100–1135) for having supported Henry&#x27;s brother Robert Curthose in his claim to the throne. After a few years in the hands of the king, the castle passed to Eustace, Count of Boulogne, by 1106. John Stow gives 1111 as the date of forfeiture.

Later in Henry&#x27;s reign, the feudal barony of Little Dunmow and the soke of Baynard&#x27;s Castle were granted to the king&#x27;s steward, Robert Fitz Richard (1064–1136), younger son of Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare (d. 1090), 1st feudal baron of Clare in Suffolk, near Dunmow. The soke was coterminous with the parish of St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe, which was adjacent to the Norman castle; the soke roughly corresponds to the present Castle Baynard ward of the City of London. Both Little Dunmow and Baynard&#x27;s Castle were eventually inherited by his grandson, Robert Fitzwalter (d. 1234).

==Fitzwalter and the barons&#x27; revolt==
Fitzwalter was the leader of the barons&#x27; revolt against King John, which culminated in the Magna Carta of 1215. The &quot;Chronicle of Dunmow&quot; relates that King John desired Fitzwalter&#x27;s daughter, Matilda the Fair (also known as Maid Marian Fitzwalter—the real-life Maid Marian of the legend of Robin Hood) and Fitzwalter was forced to take up arms to defend the honour of his daughter.

This romantic tale may well be propaganda giving legitimacy to a rebellion prompted by Fitzwalter&#x27;s reluctance to pay tax or some other dispute. He plotted with the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and Eustace de Vesci of Alnwick Castle in 1212. John got wind of the plot and exiled Fitzwalter and de Vesci, who fled to France and Scotland, respectively. On 14 January 1213 John destroyed Castle Baynard.

Fitzwalter was forgiven under the terms of the king&#x27;s submission to Pope Innocent III in May 1213. His estates were restored on 19 July 1213 and according to Stow he was given licence to repair Castle Baynard and his other castles.

It is not clear to what extent the castle was rebuilt, but in 1275 Robert FitzWalter, 1st Baron FitzWalter (Fitzwalter&#x27;s grandson), was given licence to sell the site to Robert Kilwardby, Archbishop of Canterbury, to serve as the precinct of the great Dominican Priory at Blackfriars built in 1276. Montfichet&#x27;s Tower was included in the sale, having also been destroyed by King John in 1213.

Building of the priory required a section of the City Wall to be repositioned and the former military functions of the castle were taken up by a new &quot;tower&quot; in the river at the end of the wall. Started under the great castle-builder King Edward I (1272–1307), it was completed during the reign of his son Edward II (1307–1327) and was demolished in 1502. This was probably the tower of &quot;Legate&#x27;s Inn&quot; given by Edward III to William de Ros.

==Privileges==

The lord of Castle Baynard appears to have had held a special place among the nobility of London. Robert Fitzwalter explicitly retained all the franchises and privileges associated with the lordship of Baynard when he made the sale. He claimed them in 1303, his son Robert tried again before the King&#x27;s Justices in 1327 and his brother John FitzWalter tried again in 1347 in front of the Lord Mayor of London and Common Council, all without success.

These law-suits centred on a claim to be the &quot;Chief Banneret&quot; of London. Created in the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), knights banneret led troops into battle under their own banner not that of a feudal superior. It seems that the tenure of Castle Baynard had entitled FitzWalter&#x27;s ancestors to carry the banner of the City of London, and hence be leaders of the London forces. In 1136 Robert Fitz Richard had claimed the &quot;lordship of the Thames&quot; from London to Staines, as the king&#x27;s banner-bearer and as guardian of the whole City of London.

In times of peace, the soke of Castle Baynard held a court which sentenced criminals convicted before the Lord Mayor at the Guildhall, and maintained a prison and stocks. Traitors were tied to a post at Wood Wharf and were drowned as the tide overwhelmed them. Fitzwalter was invited to the Court of Privilege, held at the Great Council in the Guildhall, sitting next to the Lord Mayor making pronouncements of all judgments. This may represent a combination of the post-Conquest Anglo-Norman roles of feudal constable and local justiciar with the ancient Anglo-Saxon office of &quot;staller&quot;. The latter was the king&#x27;s standard-bearer in war who was his spokesman at the Danish &quot;thing&quot;, the 11th-century governing assembly.

==New site==
A &quot;Hospice called le Old Inne by Pauls Wharfe&quot; is listed in the possessions of Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He may have acquired the house by his marriage to Philippa de Mohun, widow of Walter Fitzwalter (d. 1386).

A declaration of 1446 appears to identify this building with a town-house built on land reclaimed from the river, south-east of the original castle. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, rebuilt the house after a &quot;great fire&quot; in 1428, with four wings in a trapezoidal shape around a courtyard. Excavations have shown that the Roman riverside wall, on the south side of the medieval Thames Street, formed the foundation of the north wall of the new house. It seems that the nearby waterfront was known as Baynard&#x27;s Castle even after the original castle was destroyed, and the name was transferred to the building on the new site.

Gloucester died within days of being arrested for treason in 1447. The house was forfeited to the crown before being occupied at some time before 1457 by Edward&#x27;s nephew Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, the former Lord Protector, who kept 400 gentlemen and men-at-arms at the castle in his pursuit of his claim to the throne; he was killed at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460.

This London powerbase allowed York&#x27;s son to be crowned as King Edward IV in the great hall of the castle, whilst Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou were campaigning in northern England. Edward gave the castle to his mother Cecily Neville on 1 June 1461, a few weeks before his coronation, and he housed his family there for safety before the decisive Battle of Barnet.

After the young princes Edward V and his brother Richard were declared illegitimate in 1483 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, never to be seen again, Edward IV&#x27;s brother was offered the crown as King Richard III at Baynard&#x27;s Castle, as recounted in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;. His coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 6 July 1483.

==Tudors==

In 1501 King Henry VII &quot;repayred or rather new builded this house, not imbattoled, or so strongly fortified castle like, but farre more beautiful and commodious for the entertainement of any prince or greate estate&quot; (Stow). Henry&#x27;s alterations included five projecting towers between two existing polygonal corner towers on the river-front. Henry stayed at the castle when attending functions at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His son Henry VIII gave the castle to his first wife Katherine of Aragon on 10 June 1509, the day before their wedding, and the Queen took up residence there. Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV of Scotland, came to stay at Baynard&#x27;s Castle in May 1516. Katherine Howard journeyed to Baynard&#x27;s Castle in May 1541. Later one of Henry&#x27;s favourite courtiers, Sir William Sidney (–1554), tutor to his son the future Edward VI, lived in the castle and made his will there in 1548.

By 1551 the house had passed to William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1501–1570), the year in which that influential courtier was created Earl of Pembroke. It was at Baynard&#x27;s Castle that the Privy Council met to end the claim of Lady Jane Grey to the throne and proclaim Mary as Queen of England. Pembroke&#x27;s wife Anne Parr (sister of Queen Katherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII) died in the castle in 1552. The house was extended to the west in about 1550 with three wings of brick, faced with stone on the river-front. The second courtyard formed by this extension is clearly visible on Hollar&#x27;s view of London before the Great Fire. Old prints show a large gateway in the middle of the south side, a bridge of two arches and steps down to the river.

The house remained in the Herbert family until the death of Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, Chancellor of the University of Oxford. He preferred to live at Whitehall Palace while his wife Anne Clifford (1590–1676) took up residence in Baynard&#x27;s Castle, describing it in her memoirs as &quot;a house full of riches, and more secured by my lying there&quot;. The 4th Earl sided with the Parliamentarians in the Civil War and died in 1650. By 1660 and the Restoration of the Monarchy, the house was occupied by Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury, who had fought on the side of the Royalist army in their defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Samuel Pepys records that on 19 June 1660 &quot;My Lord (i.e. his relative Edward Montagu) went at night with the King to Baynard&#x27;s Castle to supper ... [the next morning he] lay long in bed this day, because he came home late from supper with the King&quot;.

==After the Great Fire==

Baynard&#x27;s Castle was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666. The engraver Wenceslaus Hollar depicted considerable ruins standing after the fire, including the stone facade on the river side, but only a round tower was left when Strype was writing in 1720. This tower had been converted into a dwelling, whilst the rest of the site became timber yards and wood wharves with Dunghill Lane running through the site from Thames Street. Richard Horwood&#x27;s map of c. 1813 shows a wharf which in 1878 belonged to the Castle Baynard Copper Company. The remaining tower (some sources say two survived) was pulled down in the 19th century to make way for warehouses of the Carron Company.
In the 1970s the area was redeveloped, with the construction of the Blackfriars underpass and a Brutalist office block named Baynard House, occupied by the telephone company BT Group. Most of the site under Baynard House is a scheduled monument.

==Archaeology==
Most of the archaeological evidence for the second Baynard&#x27;s Castle comes from excavations in 1972–5, before the construction of Baynard House office block. Parts of the north wing of both the original house and extension were found, including the north gate and gatetower, and the cobbled entrance from Thames Street. Two east–west &quot;limestone&quot; walls were found; the excavator suggested that the more northerly one was the curtain wall of the pre-1428 castle, and the other was a post-1428 replacement. The latter was surmounted by a brick facing with a rubble core, to which a rectangular pier was attached. The castle had foundations of chalk, ragstone and mortar and was built entirely on reclaimed land. Several phases of building in the late 17th century were also identified. Excavations in 1981 at the City of London School uncovered the SE corner tower of the Tudor castle. The London Archaeological Archive codes for the excavations are BC72/GM152, UT74, BC74, BC75 and BYD81.

<text>The Alliance of Builders or Developers of Islamic Iran (; ), usually shortened to Abadgaran (), was an Iranian conservative political federation of parties and organizations. Described as &quot;Iran&#x27;s neocons&quot;, main groups within the alliance were Front of Followers of the Line of the Imam and the Leader members and Society of Devotees of the Islamic Revolution.

According to the &quot;Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism&quot;, the Abadgaran &quot;seems to have been formed in 2003 and is made up broadly of figures under the age of fifty, who are non-clerics&quot;. The group originally consisted of Basij and Revolutionary Guards veterans who rose to mid- and senior-level administrative positions but marginalized during government of Hashemi Rafsanjani.

The alliance, mostly active in Tehran, won almost all of Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat and Eslamshahr&#x27;s seats in the Iranian Majlis election of 2004 and the 2003 Iranian City and Village Councils elections. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former mayor of Tehran (who was chosen by the Abadgaran–dominated Tehran City Council) was considered one of the main figures in the alliance and won the 2005 presidential election backed by the group. The victory could be said to have put to an end a long period of infighting within the Islamic Republic followed by death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989.

Embracing social justice with a promise to recreate the utopian &quot;original revolutionary spirit at the battlefields of the &quot;Sacred Defence&quot;&quot;, develop a &quot;renewed and truly revolutionary Islamic Republic&quot; for the people and “guarding the revolution and the independence of the country”, they aimed to crush the reformists as a political force, a process began by reducing power of then–President Mohammad Khatami. Controlling the parliament&#x27;s majority, they soon enacted laws that made foreign investment difficult and hampered Khatami administration&#x27;s efforts to negotiate with international companies. On the Nuclear program of Iran, they refused to ratify the Additional Protocol that Hassan Rouhani had negotiated with EU-3. They also demanded to pull out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, an action which was not permitted by Ayatollah Khamenei.

The group&#x27;s name, reflects its focus on the issue of development to present them as a rival to the ruling reformist economic policies. Fred Halliday states that the name &quot;Developers&quot; has an implicit contrast with the title of &quot;Executives of Construction&quot;, and suggests that it is closer to people and the poor than the latter group, since it conveys a sense of rural roots and values (&quot;Abadi&quot; means village in Persian). Michael Axworthy believes that the name was an &quot;awkward choice&quot;, as it sounds like it was selected because the terms for &#x27;reforms&#x27; (&quot;Eslahat&quot;) and &#x27;construction&#x27; (&quot;Sazandegi&quot;) were already taken.

Political historian Ervand Abrahamian credits the victory of Abadgaran and other conservatives in the 2003, 2004, and 2005 elections to the conservatives&#x27; retention of their core base of 25% of the voting population, their recruiting of war veteran candidates, their wooing of independents using the issue of national security, and most of all &quot;because large numbers of women, college students, and other members of the salaried middle class&quot; who make up the reformists&#x27; base of support &quot;stayed home&quot;. Turnout in the 2004 Majlis election fell below 51%, for example.

<doc id="1307344" wikidata="Q1436747" url="?curid=1307344" title="Ford Bronco II">
<text>The Ford Bronco II is a compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was manufactured by the American manufacturer Ford. Closely matching the first-generation Ford Bronco in size, the Bronco II was sold for the 1984 to 1990 model years, alongside the third and fourth generations of Ford&#x27;s full-size Bronco. Derived from the Ford Ranger compact pickup truck, the Bronco II was produced in a single generation as a three-door wagon only, competing against the three-door version of the Jeep Cherokee introduced the same year, and the compact Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy which GM had launched as smaller, similar-named SUVs alongside their full-size Blazer and Jimmy a year prior.

For the 1991 model year, Ford replaced the Bronco II with a larger but still Ranger-derived SUV, the mid-size Explorer. Alongside a three-door wagon, a five-door version was also built to better meet consumer demands. Ford&#x27;s next compact SUV was the 2001 Escape, available only as a five-door. Ford did not release another three-door SUV until the 2021 mid-size Bronco. 

The Bronco II was assembled alongside the Ford Ranger in the Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky from January 1983 to January 1990. 

==History==
The first Bronco II was developed in parallel with the Ranger pickup truck that was introduced for the 1983 model year. Introduced in March 1983, Ford marketed the Bronco II as a &quot;vehicle for men, single people, or young couples ... almost like John Wayne vehicles ... that gave people the sense that they could conquer anything ...&quot; The Bronco II was nearly a foot shorter than the competing Chevrolet S-10 Blazer (introduced for the 1983 year), and the use of the Ranger chassis allowed for lower production costs by using a common assembly line with many shared components.

All Bronco IIs were four-wheel drive until 1986 when the rear-wheel-drive layout became standard. Rear-wheel-drive models were still equipped with a transfer case, capped or sealed where the front driveshaft was connected on four-wheel-drive versions.

=== 1989 update ===
For the 1989 model year, the Bronco II was restyled alongside the Ranger. The exterior featured new front bodywork with a new hood, front fenders, and a closer-fitting front bumper. Inside, the dashboard was redesigned, featuring a new instrument panel. Alongside the overall change in appearance, the new bodywork marked improvements in structural support. The 1989 Bronco II was short-lived as it was built for a little less than a year when production ended in early 1990. It was succeeded by the larger Ford Explorer for 1991.

As a running change, four-wheel drive 1990 models produced after November 1989 were produced with Dana 35 front axles, replacing the previous Dana 28 front axle.

==Engines==
The 1984 and 1985 models were equipped with the German-built carbureted 2.8 L Cologne V6 with at 4600 rpm, which was also used in the 1984 and 1985 Ford Ranger. It was originally available exclusively with four-wheel drive. The 1986 model year introduced the fuel injected 2.9 L Cologne V6 engine.

A Mitsubishi 4-cylinder 2.3 L turbodiesel was optional during the 1986 &amp; 1987 model years; however it delivered poor performance and had low sales.

== Discontinuation ==
Before the 1991 model year, the Bronco II was discontinued in February 1990, with its role in the Ford light-truck line largely taken over by the Ford Explorer. While the Explorer was also based upon the Ranger (to the point of also sharing parts of its interior with the Bronco II and Ranger), the Explorer was a mid-size SUV. Sized slightly larger than the S-10 Blazer, the five-door Explorer was nearly longer than a 1990 Bronco II. As a more direct successor, a shorter-wheelbase three-door Explorer Sport was introduced (though still a foot longer than a Bronco II). The Explorer was solely powered by a 160 hp 4.0 L &quot;Cologne&quot; V6 engine shared with the Ranger and Ford Aerostar, no smaller engines were available.

The Explorer would be developed in parallel with the Ranger through its first generation until its major update in the 1995 to 2001 model years where it lost all its exterior styling shared with the Ranger.

==Safety controversy==
Stability problems with Bronco II were noted during the design phase, as well as in the verification tests by 1981. For example, the J-turn test was canceled during the testing procedures by Ford officials &quot;out of fear of killing or injuring one of its own drivers.&quot; Engineering modifications were suggested, but Ford officials declined the modifications because they would have delayed the marketing of the new vehicles. Eight months before production began, Ford&#x27;s Office of General Counsel collected 113 documents concerning the new vehicle&#x27;s handling problems. However, 53 of these test, simulation, and related reports about the stability of the Bronco II &quot;disappeared&quot; in an &quot;unusual document handling procedure&quot; that forebode the lawsuits against Ford starting in the late-1980s.

The Bronco II was dogged by reports that it was prone to rollovers. Some of the headlines in 1989-90 included &quot;NHTSA Investigates Bronco II Rollovers,&quot; &quot;Automotive News&quot; (March 20, 1989) &quot;Magazine Gives Ford&#x27;s Bronco II &#x27;Avoid&#x27; Rating,&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (May 8, 1989), and &quot;Consumer Reports Criticizes Ford Bronco II&#x27;s Handling,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (May 18, 1989).

After analysis of SUV crashes of the Suzuki Samurai, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal study of the Ford Bronco II in 1989. There were 43 Bronco II rollover fatalities in 1987, compared with eight for the Samurai, but accident data in four states showed the Bronco II&#x27;s rollover rate was similar to that of other SUVs, so the investigation was closed. NHTSA declined to reopen the investigation in 1997 after more Bronco II crashes.

It was estimated that 260 people had died in Bronco II rollover crashes, a rate that is several times more than in any similar vehicle according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. By 1995, Ford had paid $113 million to settle 334 injury and wrongful death lawsuits. A class-action settlement with owners of its controversial Bronco II provided &quot;new safety warnings and up to $200 for repairs and modifications.&quot; Ford ended production of the Bronco II in 1990, but &quot;always contended that rollovers are overwhelmingly caused by bad driving or unsafe modifications to the vehicle.&quot;

Individual lawsuit examples include famed jockey Bill Shoemaker, that awarded him one million dollars. Shoemaker was paralyzed from the neck down after rolling his Bronco II in California in 1991 while intoxicated. Thereafter, he was confined to a wheelchair. The largest award involving the Bronco II up to 1995 was a $62.4 million verdict for two passengers, one of whom who received brain injuries and left her in need of a legal guardian, after the 1986 model in which they were riding rolled over.

The safety record was &quot;frightening&quot; with &quot;one in 500 Bronco II&#x27;s ever produced [being] involved in a fatal rollover.&quot; Automobile insurer GEICO stopped writing insurance policies for the Bronco II. By 2001, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the &quot;notorious bucking Bronco II&quot; rollover lawsuits had &quot;cost the company approximately $2.4 billion in damage settlements.&quot;

One of the reasons for the significant losses by the automaker was a deal Ford made with a former engineer, David Bickerstaff. He worked on the Bronco II and had published SAE reports about Ford truck suspensions. In 1990, Bickerstaff testified in court that the Bronco II had a dangerously low stability index. His credibility was questioned by attorneys.

<doc id="1307353" wikidata="Q646574" url="?curid=1307353" title="Jowhar">
<text>Jowhar (, , Italian: &quot;Giohar&quot;) is the capital city of Hirshabelle state of Somalia. Jowhar is also the administrative capital of Middle Shabelle region of Somalia. 

Along with Baidoa, it used to form the joint administrative capital of the Transitional Federal Government, which it captured from the Islamic Courts Union.

The city lies 90 km (50 mi) along a major road north of the national capital of Mogadishu.

== Etymology ==
Jowhar, (also &quot;Jawharad&quot; or &quot;Johoorad&quot;) is the word for a precious stone in Somali, and the city may have been named after the lush lands it&#x27;s situated on, near the Shabelle river. Originally from Persian, this word is also used in Arabic and other languages to describe gemstones and other jewels.

==History==
During the Middle Ages, Jowhar and much of the surrounding area in southern Somalia was governed by the Ajuran Empire. The town later came under the administration of the Hiraab Imamate in the late 17th century after the collapse of the powerful Ajuran Empire. At the turn of the 20th century, Jowhar was incorporated into Italian Somaliland. After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official Jowhar District.

===Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi===

The Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi was founded by a senior member of the Italian Royal Family, H.R.H. Principe Luigi Amedeo, Duca degli Abruzzi in 1920, who first came to the African continent in 1905 and liked the place. The Duke raised funds to build dams, roads, a railway, schools, hospitals, a church and a mosque.

The village called Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi (or &quot;Villabruzzi&quot;) was founded as an agricultural settlement in Italian Somalia experimenting with new cultivation techniques. In 1926, the colony comprised 16 villages, with some 3,000 Somali and 200 Italian inhabitants. It was commonly known as &quot;Villabruzzi&quot;.

Starting around 1911, Italians like the Duca degli Abruzzi started to take the local farmers and resettle them in specific new villages in an attempt to improve the economy of Italian Somalia. The area around Villabruzzi was the most agriculturally developed of Somalia before World War II and had some food industries.

==Administrative capital==
As part of a 2004 agreement, Jowhar and the town of Baidoa were to form a joint administrative capital of the Transitional Federal Government, sited away from Mogadishu for security reasons. Continued fighting threatened to derail the peace process. However, in July 2005, President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed relocated to the town from his base in Bosaso, moving the process forward and joining Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Ghedi, who had already been resident in the town for a month. Part of the parliament became based in Jowhar, while some ministries were established in Mogadishu. By February 2006, despite Ghedi&#x27;s security concerns, the two leaders had left to Baidoa, where it was decided the parliament would convene.

==Demographics==
The district had estimated population of 269,851 as of 2014, a survey was done by (UNDP) in 2014 and it is primarily inhabited by Abgaal clan.

==Recent history==

=== Ethiopian invasion and occupation (2006–2009) ===
During the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia, the city was captured from the Islamic Courts Union during the Battle of Jowhar on December 27, 2006. ICU insurgents recaptured Jowhar on 12 July 2008 and took over the towns administration.

=== Somali Civil War (2009–present) ===
On May 17, 2009, the Islamist al-Shabab militia took the town, and imposed new rules, including a ban on handshaking between men and women. TFG and ICU paramilitary forces were dispatched to seize back the town.

On December 9, 2012, Somali National Army forces assisted by AMISOM troops re-captured the city from the militants.

<text>The Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon (), better known by the acronym Hukbalahap, was a Filipino communist guerrilla movement formed by the farmers of Central Luzon. They were originally formed to fight the Japanese, but extended their fight into a rebellion against the Philippine government, known as the Hukbalahap rebellion in 1946. It was eventually put down through a series of reforms and military victories by Defense Secretary, and later President, Ramon Magsaysay.

A monument dedicated to the Huks in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija, was constructed to honor their actions during World War II.

On October 14, 2023, the Luis M. Taruc Hukbalahap Monument at Garden of Peace Memorial Park in Santa Monica, San Luis, Pampanga, was unveiled to honor about 400 guerrilla fighters (including Luis Taruc, the late Antonio Sumang and 96-year-old Praxedes Clarin, in the statue, one of the nine surviving Huks) including Olimpia Ingal, Narciso Garcia, Josefa Tolentino, and Clemente Miranda, all 94, Dominga Sanchez, Anastacia Sali, and Natalia Lacanlale, all 98 and Francisca Salas, 99).

Constituted in March 1942, the Hukbalahap was to be part of a broad united front resistance to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. This original intent is reflected in its name.

By 1950, the Communist Party of the Philippines (PKP) had resolved to reconstitute the organization as the armed wing of a revolutionary party, prompting a change in the official name to &quot;Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan&quot;, likely in emulation of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

Notwithstanding this name change, the HMB continued to be popularly known as the &quot;Hukbalahap&quot;, and the English-speaking press continued to refer to it and its members, interchangeably, as the Huks (Singular: Huk) during the whole period between 1945 and 1952.

==Background==
The Hukbalahap movement has deep roots in the Spanish &quot;encomienda&quot;, a system of grants to reward soldiers who had conquered New Spain, established in 1570. This developed into a system of exploitation. In the 19th century, Filipino landlordism, under the Spanish colonization, arose further abuses.

After the opening of ports in Manila, Luzon&#x27;s economy was transformed to meet the demands for exports of rice, sugar, and tobacco. Landowners increased the demands on farmers who rented parcels of land. These demands included increased rents, demands for proceeds from the sale of crops, and predatory lending agreements to fund farm improvements.

Only after the coming of the Americans were reforms initiated to lessen tensions between tenants and landlords. The reforms, however, did not solve the problems, and with growing political consciousness produced by education, peasants began to unite under educated but poor leaders. The most potent of these organizations was the Hukbalahap, which began as a resistance organization against the Japanese but ended as an anti-government resistance movement in 1946.

==Inception during World War II==
The idea of a guerrilla organization was conceived as early as October 1941, months before the Philippines&#x27; entry to World War II. As early as 1941, Juan Feleo, a well-known peasant leader and member of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP), had begun to mobilize peasants in his home province of Nueva Ecija for the conflict. Pedro Abad Santos, The founding member of the Socialist Party of the Philippines, had also ordered Luis Taruc to mobilize forces in Pampanga.

At the outbreak of World War II in the Philippines and the capture of Manila, top-ranking leaders of the PKP were captured by the Japanese military. Crisanto Evangelista, its founder, was among those who were captured and executed in 1942. Abad Santos was similarly captured but was released in 1943. Dr. Vicente Lava took the reins of the PKP and tried to re-organize the party.

In February 1942, a &quot;struggle conference&quot; was held in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija to discuss organization, strategy, and tactics. Members of the PKP, the Popular Front Party, the League for the Defense of Democracy, KPMP, AMT, and KAP convened to create a structure for unified resistance against the Japanese.

A united front tactic was agreed upon as a means of attracting the broadest sections of population, not necessarily communists. A three-front resistance was agreed upon: military, political, and economic. The military aim was to harass the Japanese continuously and keep it off-balance so as to prevent it from focusing on activities aimed at winning the goodwill of the people. The political aim was to discredit the Japanese-sponsored republic and build the concept of a functioning democracy as a grass roots level, while the economic objective was to prevent the enemy&#x27;s looting. The result was the creation of the Central Luzon Bureau (CLB), an organization meant to lead resistance against the Japanese. Key positions were filled out as follows:

At the advent of this conference, several armed groups were immediately organized and began operating in Central Luzon. A significant event was on March 13, 1942, when a squadron headed by Felipa Culala (alias Dayang-Dayang) encountered and defeated Japanese forces in Mandili, Candaba, Pampanga. News of Culala&#x27;s successful raid raised morale for the resistance fighters.

On March 29, 1942, peasant leaders met in a forest clearing located in Sitio Bawit, Barrio San Julian, at the junction of Tarlac, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija to form a united organization. &quot;Hukbong Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon&quot; was chosen as the name of the organization. After the meeting, a military committee was formed with Taruc (&quot;Supremo&quot;), Castro Alejandrino (Vice Commander), Bernardo Poblete (), and Culala as members. The Hukbalahap high command was also joined by the military commissariat; a party apparatus that provided guidance to the Huks.

The CLB was regarded as the &quot;wartime version of the PKP&quot;. While PKP officials did assume important positions in the Huk structure, the movement encompassed more that simply members of the PKP and its affiliated organizations.

Robert Lapham reports either Luis Taruc or Casto Alejandrino met with Lieutenant Colonel Claude Thorp at Camp Sanchez in the spring of 1942, and the conferees agreed to cooperate, share equipment and supplies, with the Americans providing trainers. However, though the Huks fought the Japanese, they also &quot;tried to thwart United States Army Forces in the Far East guerrillas&quot;, &quot;therefore, they were considered disloyal and were not accorded U.S. recognition or benefits at the end of the war.&quot;

After its inception, the group grew quickly and, by late summer in 1943, It was claimed to have 15,000 to 20,000 active men and women military fighters and 50,000 more in reserve. These fighters&#x27; weaponry was obtained primarily by stealing it from battlefields and downed planes left behind by the Japanese, Filipinos, and Americans. They fought Japanese troops, worked to subvert the Japanese tax-collection service, intercepted food and supplies to the Japanese troops, and created a training school where they taught political theory and military tactics based on Marxist ideas. In areas that the group controlled, they set up local governments (, Barrio United Defense Corps) and instituted land reforms, dividing up the largest estates equally among the peasants and often killing the landlords. In some cases, however, landlords were welcomed as participants in Huk resistance, swayed by anti-Japanese sympathies. PKP organizers quickly went to work to set up BUDCs in Huk controlled barrios, which contributed to its success as a resistance army, although in reality there was an overlap between independently formed barrio governments, &quot;neighborhood committees&quot; set up by the Japanese, and BUDCs.

The Huk movement was notable for its inclusion of women peasants, who advocated for inclusion in the movement in resistance to the word of Japanese war atrocities against women, including rape and mutilation. Many of these women fought, but the majority of the resistance remained in villages, collecting supplies and intelligence. Women in the forest camps were forbidden from entering combat, but often trained in first aid, communication/propaganda, and recruitment tactics.

The Huks enjoyed early successes with their continuous attacks, aimed at raising morale through quick successes as well as to acquire weapons for the severely unarmed group. The Japanese conducted two counterattacks against the Huks, on September 6 and December 5, 1942. Both attacks did nothing to dampen the frequency of Huk raids, and only served to intensify Huk operations. On March 5, 1943, the Japanese struck the Huk headquarters in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija in a surprise attack. A large number of CPP cadres and Huk soldiers were captured during the raid. By the end of the war, the Huks had 1,200 engagements, and inflicted some 25,000 enemy casualties. The Huks&#x27; strength consisted of 20,000 fully armed regulars and some 50,000 reservists.

===Relationship with other guerrillas===
The Hukhbalahap&#x27;s methods were often portrayed by other guerrilla leaders as terrorist; for example, Ray Hunt, an American who led his own band of 3,000 guerrillas, said of the Hukbalahap that

My experiences with the Huks were always unpleasant. Those I knew were much better assassins than soldiers. Tightly disciplined and led by fanatics, they murdered some Filipino landlords and drove others off to the comparative safety of Manila. They were not above plundering and torturing ordinary Filipinos, and they were treacherous enemies of all other guerrillas (on Luzon).

However, the Hukbalahap claimed that it extended its guerrilla warfare campaign for over a decade merely in search of recognition as World War II freedom fighters and former American and Filipino allies who deserved a share of war reparations.

==Post-war and rebellion==

The end of the war saw the return of American forces in the Philippines. While the Hukbalahap expected to have their war efforts recognized and be treated as allies, the Americans, with the help of USAFFE guerrillas and former PC members, forcibly disarmed Huk squadrons while charging other guerrillas of treason, sedition, and subversive activity, leading to the arrests of Luis Taruc and Casto Alejandrino in 1945, as well as incidents such as the massacre of 109 Huk guerrillas in Malolos, Bulacan.

In September 1945, President Sergio Osmeña released Taruc, Alejandrino, and other Huk leaders from prison. The PKP, through Huk leaders, then formally disbanded the movement and formed the Hukbalahap Veterans&#x27; League in an effort to get the Hukbalahap recognized as a legitimate guerrilla movement. Alejandrino was its nominal chairman.

In 1946, peasants in Central Luzon backed members of the Democratic Alliance in that year&#x27;s election, with six candidates eventually winning seats in the Senate. Among these candidates was Luis Taruc. However, they were blocked from sitting in Congress by the government, which only exacerbated negative sentiment among the peasants in Central Luzon. The new Roxas administration attempted a pacification program, with help from Taruc, Alejandrino, Juan Feleo, and other representatives. They would be accompanied by MP guards and government officials to try and pacify peasant groups, however this did not result in any sort of success. Within days of the so-called &quot;truce&quot;, violence once again erupted in Central Luzon. Taruc and others claimed that civilian guards and government officials were &quot;sabotaging the peace process&quot;.

On August 24, 1946, Feleo was stopped by a large band of &quot;armed men in fatigue uniforms&quot; in Gapan, Nueva Ecija. He had planned to present the peasant&#x27;s concerns to the Secretary of the Interior Jose Zulueta, before he was taken and killed. Thousands of Huk veterans and PKM members were sure that Feleo was murdered by landlords, or possibly the Roxas administration itself. The incident led to Taruc joining the peasants and re-igniting the insurrection. The Roxas administration then outlawed the Hukbalahap on March 6, 1948.

In 1949, Hukbalahap members ambushed and murdered Aurora Quezon, Chairman of the Philippine Red Cross and widow of the Philippines&#x27; second president, Manuel L. Quezon, as she was en route to her hometown for the dedication of the Quezon Memorial Hospital. Several others were also killed, including her eldest daughter and son-in-law. This attack brought worldwide condemnation of the Huks, who claimed that the attack was done by &quot;renegade&quot; members. The continuing condemnation and new post-war causes of the movement prompted the Huk leaders to adopt a new name, the &quot;&quot; or the &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot; in 1950.

Public sympathies for the movement had been waning due to their postwar attacks. The Huks confiscated funds and property to sustain their movement and relied on small village organizers for political and material support. The Huk movement was mainly spread in the central provinces of Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Bulacan, and in Nueva Vizcaya, Pangasinan, Laguna, Bataan, and Quezon.

An important movement in the campaign against the Huks was the deployment of hunter-killer counter guerrilla special units. The &quot;Nenita&quot; unit (1946–1949) was the first of such special forces whose main mission was to eliminate the Huks. The Nenita force was commanded by Major Napoleon Valeriano. The Nenita terror tactics which were not only committed against dissidents but also towards law-abiding people sometimes helped the Huks gain supporters as a consequence.

In July 1950, Major Valeriano assumed command of the elite 7th Battalion Combat Team (BCT) in Bulacan. The 7th BCT would develop a reputation toward employing a more comprehensive, more unconventional counterinsurgency strategy and reduced the random brutality against the civilian population.

In June 1950, American alarm over the Hukbalahap rebellion during the Cold War prompted President Harry Truman to approve special military assistance that included military advice, sale at cost of military equipment to the Philippines and financial aid under the Joint United States Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG). On August 26, 1950, in an &quot;anniversary celebration&quot; of the Cry of Pugad Lawin, the Huks temporarily seized Santa Cruz, Laguna, and Camp Makabulos, Tarlac, confiscating money, food, weapons, ammunition, clothing, medicine, and office supplies. In September 1950, former USAFFE guerrilla, Ramon Magsaysay was appointed as Minister of National Defense on American advice. With the Hukbalahap rebellion growing in strength and the security situation in the Philippines becoming seriously threatened, Magsaysay urged President Elpidio Quirino to suspend the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for the duration of the Huk campaign. On October 18, 1950, Magsaysay captured the Secretariat, including General Secretary José Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila.

American assistance allowed Magsaysay to create more BCTs, bringing the total to twenty-six. By 1951, army strength had increased by 60 percent over the previous year with 1,047-man BCTs. Major military offensive campaigns against the Huks were carried out by the 7th, 16th, 17th, and 22nd BCTs.

Another major effort against the Huks was Operation &quot;Knockout&quot; of the Panay Task Force (composed of the 15th BCT, some elements of the 9th BCT and the PC commands of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique) under the command of Colonel Alfredo M. Santos. The Operation conducted a surprise attack on Guillermo Capadocia, commander of the Huk Regional Command in the Visayas, erstwhile Secretary General and one of the founders of the PKP. Santos&#x27; masterstroke was the enlistment of Pedro Valentin, a local mountain leader who knew the people and the terrain like the back of his hand. Capadocia died on Panay, of battle wounds, on September 20, 1952.

In 1954, Lieutenant Colonel Laureño Maraña, the former head of Force X of the 16th PC Company, assumed command of the 7th BCT, which had become one of the most mobile striking forces of the Philippine ground forces against the Huks, from Valeriano who was now a colonel. Force X employed psychological warfare through combat intelligence and infiltration that relied on secrecy in planning, training, and execution of attack. The lessons learned from Force X and Nenita were combined in the 7th BCT.

With the all out anti-dissidence campaigns against the Huks, they numbered less than 2,000 by 1954 and without the protection and support of local supporters, active Huk resistance no longer presented a serious threat to Philippine security. From February to mid-September 1954, the largest anti-Huk operation, &quot;Operation Thunder-Lightning&quot; was conducted and resulted in the surrender of Luis Taruc on May 17. Further cleanup operations of guerrillas remaining lasted throughout 1955, diminishing its number to less than 1,000 by year&#x27;s end.

==Organization==
The Hukbalahap was regarded by the PKP as its &quot;citizen&#x27;s army&quot; against the Japanese. It was headed by the Central Luzon Bureau, with Vicente Lava as its secretary, and a secretariat, ostensibly a party apparatus meant to keep the Huks in line with PKP ideology. There were five committees which composed the Huk structure:
#Finance and Provisions – responsible for supplying provisions and other necessities to the guerrillas.
#Organization and Communication – responsible for coordinating the relationship between the leadership and its support base.
#Military Committee – responsible for the guerrilla&#x27;s army regiments.
#Intelligence and Education – responsible for political education and information on enemy activity, and
#United Front – responsible for propaganda and mobilizing support.

The Huk military structured was modeled after the Chinese Red Army. It was composed of squads and platoons, consisting of 100 officers and men, which formed a squadron. Two squadrons formed one battalion, and two battalions formed a regiment. These numbers were not always followed though: For example, Squadron 8, based in Talavera, Nueva Ecija, had twelve squads, each with a dozen men.







The initial force of 500 armed Huks which was organized into five squadrons had increased to a fully armed guerrilla force of 20,000 men. By 1944, Huk strength numbers at 76 squadrons. After the Cabiao raid by the Japanese, the PKP adopted a &quot;retreat for defense&quot; policy, which broke up squads to smaller groups of three to five men.

In areas controlled by Huk guerrillas, the Huks organized an ad-hoc police force to keep the peace and stop looters and thieves. Huks also formed &quot;Sandatahang Tanod ng Bayan&quot; (Barrio United Defense Corps), which acted as neighborhood governments in support of the Huk forces in the field. These BUDC&#x27;s were composed of KPMP and AMT members, which organized popular support for Huks, shielded harvest from the Japanese, and attacked Filipino collaborators; in effect, setting up protected zones and safe havens for the Huks. The Hukbalahap also set-up a government, composed of a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and five policemen. The barrio government also had three departments, with a person-in-charge leading it. One department collected intelligence information about the military, another handled communication between different barrios and Huk members, and the third arranged for supplies. The Hukbalahap government also performed civil tasks, such as officiating in weddings, baptisms, funerals, and issued marriage licenses and birth certificates.

<text>Ernest L. Martin (April 20, 1932 – January 2002) was a meteorologist, minister in the Worldwide Church of God and author on Biblical topics. He is best known for his controversial works on the Star of Bethlehem and the location of the Temple in Jerusalem.

==Background==
Martin was born in Meeker, Oklahoma. He attended grade and high school in Exeter, California, and graduated from the College of the Sequoias in Visalia, California, which specialized in meteorology. From 1950 to 1954, he was a member of the United States Air Force which sent him to the University of New Mexico to further his education in meteorology, and following this he became a weather forecaster in Greenland. He spent another year at Lowry AFB working in research and development for High Altitude studies in Denver, Colorado.

==Ministry and teaching==
During 1955, Martin became a supporter of the ministry of Herbert W. Armstrong and the Radio Church of God (later known as the Worldwide Church of God). He attended Ambassador College at Pasadena, California, in 1958 and later transferred to the campus in Bricket Wood, England. He was ordained as a minister of the Radio Church of God in 1959 and continued with his studies at Ambassador College to finally earn an unaccredited Ph.D. in education in 1966. From 1960 to 1972, he taught history, theology and elementary meteorology at the Ambassador College campus in Bricket Wood where he became Dean of Faculty.

Between 1969 and 1973, Ambassador College entered into an alliance with Hebrew University in Israel which had been negotiated by Martin. This undertaking commenced a five-year archaeological program with students from Ambassador College working on Dr. Benjamin Mazar&#x27;s excavation near the Western Wall of the Temple Mount. During this period, Martin supervised 450 participating college students during summer months. The partnership was mentioned in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article.

Following the closure of the Ambassador College campus in England, Martin became Chairman of the Department of Theology at Ambassador College in Pasadena, California, in 1973. In the following year, he severed his membership in the Worldwide Church of God. In 1974, he created the Foundation for Biblical Research in Pasadena where he remained as chairman until 1985. In the same year, he founded Associates for Scriptural Knowledge and became a member of various other societies.

==Author==
In 1974, Martin wrote the first of five editions of &quot;The Tithing Dilemma&quot; of which over 100,000 copies were sold. It was this work which triggered the first of many major schisms within the Worldwide Church of God.

Martin proposed a recalculation of the birth of Jesus in his books &quot;The Birth of Christ Recalculated&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Star that Astonished the World&quot; (1996). He argued that the &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot; was the planet Jupiter, called Zedeq (&quot;Righteousness&quot;) in Hebrew, leading the wise men to Jesus in Bethlehem on December 25, 2 BCE, coinciding with the Jewish Festival of Hanukkah that year. Martin argued that the birth of Jesus happened on the evening of September 11, 3 BCE, which corresponds to Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year on the first of Tishri on the Jewish calendar.

In his 1999 book &quot;The Temples that Jerusalem Forgot&quot;, Martin argued that the Haram al-Sharif is not the location of the last Temple. This was significant given his relationship with Herbert W. Armstrong whose editorial in &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine was cited by Denis Michael Rohan as a reason for setting fire to the Al Aqsa mosque during the 1960s.

The basis of this work began with Martin&#x27;s first visit to Jerusalem in 1961 when he first met Benjamin Mazar and later his son Ory Mazar, who informed him of his belief that the Temples of Solomon and Zerubbabel were located on the Ophel mound to the north of the original Mount Zion on the southeast ridge. In a 1996 draft report to support this theory, Martin wrote, &quot;I was then under the impression that Simon the Hasmonean (along with Herod a century later) moved the Temple from the Ophel mound to the Dome of the Rock area.&quot; However, after studying the words of Josephus concerning the Temple of Herod the Great, which was reported to be in the same general area of the former Temples, he then read the account of Eleazar who led the final contingent of Jewish resistance to the Romans at Masada which stated that the Roman fortress was the only structure left by 73 C.E.. &quot;With this key in mind, I came to the conclusion in 1997 that all the Temples were indeed located on the Ophel mound over the area of the Gihon Spring.&quot; From these conclusions, Martin produced his book in which he asserted that the Temples of Jerusalem were located over the Gihon Spring and not over the Dome of the Rock. He wrote, &quot;What has been amazing to me is the vast amount of Jewish, Muslim, and Christian records that remain available from the first to the sixteenth centuries that clearly vindicate the conclusions that I have reached in this book of research.&quot;

His other works are &quot;Restoring the Original Bible&quot; (1984), &quot;Secrets of Golgotha&quot; (1987), &quot;101 Bible Secrets&quot; (1991), &quot;The Biblical Manual&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Essentials of New Testament Doctrine&quot; (1999).

<doc id="1307367" wikidata="Q463185" url="?curid=1307367" title="Allen Collins">
<text>Larkin Allen Collins Jr. (July 19, 1952 – January 23, 1990) was an American guitarist, and one of the founding members of the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. He co-wrote many of the band&#x27;s songs with frontman and original lead singer Ronnie Van Zant.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Collins was born in Jacksonville, Florida. He started playing guitar at 12 years of age, with a few lessons from his stepmother, Leila Collins, a country-and-western guitarist, and received his first guitar and amplifier from his mother. Inspired by the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964, he formed his first group, The Mods, with friends Larry Steele (bass), Donnie Ulsh (guitar), and James Rice (drums). Collins attended Nathan B. Forrest High School.

In 1970, Collins married Kathy Johns. All of his bandmates were in his wedding party, but Kathy worried that the band&#x27;s long haired appearance would disturb her parents. To solve this problem, she required all the band members to keep their hair under wigs at the wedding ceremony. The wedding reception was one of the first public performances of &quot;Free Bird&quot; complete with the trademark extended guitar jam at the end. Collins&#x27;s family grew with the birth of his daughter Amie, followed quickly by Allison. Collins was fond of cars, and had an extensive car collection, one of his favorites being a 1932 Plymouth coupe nicknamed &quot;Dixie Blue&quot;.

=== Career with Lynyrd Skynyrd ===
Collins joined Skynyrd in Jacksonville, Florida, just two weeks after its formation by Ronnie Van Zant and Gary Rossington, along with Bob Burns and Larry Junstrom. Knowing that Collins played guitar and owned his own equipment, the band decided to approach him about joining them. Van Zant and Burns both had a reputation for trouble, and Collins fled on his bicycle and hid up a tree when he saw them pull up in his driveway. They soon convinced him that they were not there to beat him up and he agreed to join the band, then known as &quot;The One Percent&quot;.

Collins and lead singer Ronnie Van Zant co-wrote many of the biggest Skynyrd hits, including &quot;Free Bird&quot;, &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot;, and &quot;That Smell&quot;. The band received national success beginning in 1973 while opening for the Who on their &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; tour.

On October 20, 1977, an airplane carrying the band crashed into a forest in Mississippi, killing three band members, including Van Zant. Collins was seriously injured in the crash, suffering two broken vertebrae in his neck and severe damage to his right arm. Amputation was recommended but Collins&#x27; father refused, and he eventually recovered.

=== Later life and death ===

During the early 1980s Collins continued to perform onstage in the Rossington Collins Band, which enjoyed modest success, releasing two albums (&quot;Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere&quot; and &quot;This Is the Way&quot;), and charting a few singles (notably &quot;Don&#x27;t Misunderstand Me&quot;).

In 1980, during the first days of the band&#x27;s debut concert tour, Kathy died suddenly of a hemorrhage during the miscarriage of their third child. This forced the tour&#x27;s cancellation. The Rossington Collins Band disbanded in 1982. Collins continued to pursue music, starting the Allen Collins Band, which released one album, &quot;Here, There &amp; Back&quot; in 1983. The six members included two Skynyrd bandmates – keyboardist Billy Powell and bassist Leon Wilkeson – along with lead singer Jimmy Dougherty, drummer Derek Hess, and guitarists Barry Lee Harwood and Randall Hall. In 1984, Collins tried to resurrect the band, hiring Jacksonville guitarist Mike Owings and bassist Andy Ward King. Later members included guitarist-vocalist Michael Ray FitzGerald and bassist &quot;Filthy Phil&quot; Price.

On January 29, 1986, Collins was driving a new black Ford Thunderbird in Jacksonville on Plummer Grant Road when he lost control of the car just south of Old St. Augustine Road and crashed. The crash claimed the life of his girlfriend, Debra Jean Watts, and paralyzed the guitarist from the waist down, with limited use of his arms and hands. Collins pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter as well as driving under the influence of alcohol. Due to his injuries, he would never play guitar on stage again.

Collins&#x27; last performance with Lynyrd Skynyrd was at the band&#x27;s first reunion after the plane crash at the 1979 Volunteer Jam V in Nashville, Tennessee. All remaining members of Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited officially in 1987, but Collins served only as musical director, due to his paralysis. As part of his plea bargain for the 1986 accident, Collins addressed fans at every Skynyrd concert with an explanation of why he could not perform, citing the dangers of drinking and driving, as well as drugs and alcohol. Also, because of Collins&#x27; crash, the band donated a sizable amount of concert proceeds from the 1987–88 tour to the Miami Project, which is involved in treatment of paralysis. Collins founded Roll For Rock Wheelchair Events and Benefit Concerts in 1988 to raise awareness and to provide opportunities for those living with spinal cord injuries and other physical disabilities.

Collins died on January 23, 1990, from chronic pneumonia, a complication of the paralysis. He is buried beside his wife in Jacksonville, Florida.

== Instruments ==

In the early days of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Collins used a black Gibson Flying V. This guitar was stolen, along with Gary Rossington&#x27;s white Gibson SG, when the band&#x27;s van was broken into after a gig. For most of his tenure in Skynyrd, Collins used a Gibson Firebird fitted with a chrome-covered, &quot;dog-eared&quot; P-90 pickup in the bridge position and a Gibson &quot;teaspoon&quot; nickel vibrato arm. In 1976 he switched to a natural-finished korina 1958 Gibson Explorer that he had bought for about $3,000, and used that guitar throughout his tenure with the Allen Collins Band.

In late 1977 Collins began occasionally playing a Gibson Les Paul Special, with a double cutaway, P-90s, a sunburst finish, and modded with a Lyre Tremolo. He continued to use this guitar in the Rossington Collins Band as well. On &quot;Gimme Back My Bullets&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, and &quot;Every Mother&#x27;s Son&quot; Collins used a Sunburst Fender Stratocaster after Ed King had left. Collins was also filmed playing an all-black Stratocaster with a rosewood fingerboard, white pickups and white control knobs.

<text>Seisdon is a rural village in the parish of Trysull and Seisdon, Staffordshire approximately six miles west of Wolverhampton and the name of one of the five hundreds of Staffordshire. The population recorded at the 2011 census does not distinguish this hamlet from the rest of the parish, which had a population of 1,150.

==Etymology==
The name appears to mean &quot;hill of the Saxons&quot;, deriving from the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;Seis&quot; meaning Saxon and &quot;Dun&quot; meaning hill. The first element may alternatively be a personal name.

==Location and Sites==
Seisdon is a hamlet within the parish of Trysull and Seisdon (formerly named Trysull, only), lying one mile north-west of the village of Trysull, near the border with Shropshire. There is a narrow bridge of several arches over the river Smestow, which is of 18th-century origin. On the county boundary there is a high position which formed an ancient entrenchment named Abbot&#x27;s Wood (Apewood) Castle.

Seisdon Hall is a grade II Listed Building dating from the 17th century and greatly extended around 1840-1850 by the Aston-Pudset family. It was previously known as Green Farm.

==History==
The hamlet is remarkable for giving the name to the Hundred, for which no adequate authority can now be adduced. However, a large number of Hundred names refer to hills or mounds. It seems likely that such sites were chosen as being remote, and where interference was most easily avoided. Place-name evidence suggests a fairly early Anglo-Saxon origin for the name. Certainly the village of Seisdon was of sufficient importance prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066 to have its owners and value recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Having been held by four English free men before the conquest, it came into the hands of William Fitz-Ansculf who held 600 acres in Seisdon and also land in Trysull and other parts of the parish.

Almost all of its residents were originally employed in the agricultural industry.

==Seisdon Hundred==
Each hundred was formed to support a military unit. Seisdon Hundred contains the smallest area of the five hundreds of Staffordshire, but it has a relatively high population density and agricultural productivity. It formed the south-western portion of the county, bounded on the west by Shropshire, on the south by Worcestershire, on the east by Offlow Hundred, and on the north by Cuttleston Hundred. The old Forest of Brewood formed the boundary of Seisdon and Cuttleston.

Seisdon Hundred was divided into North and South Divisions. each with their own High Constable.

The Hundred contained Wolverhampton, the largest town of the county, and many populous villages, which were constituted into 18 parishes, part of two others and two extra parochial areas. Wolverhampton parish contained several townships some of which were in Offlow Hundred. The parishes in 1834 were as follows:

The Hundred presented a great diversity of soil and scenery. It was rich in coal, ironstone, lime, and freestone, and renowned for its extensive mines and iron works, and for the manufacture of a great variety of articles in iron, steel, and other metals.

There was a Seisdon Rural District from 1894 to 1974.

<doc id="1307383" wikidata="Q5161126" url="?curid=1307383" title="Conivaptan">
<text>Conivaptan, sold under the brand name Vaprisol, is a non-peptide inhibitor of the receptor for anti-diuretic hormone, also called vasopressin. It was approved in 2004 for hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels). The compound was discovered by Astellas and marked in 2006. The drug is now marketed by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Conivaptan inhibits two of the three subtypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2). Effectively, it causes iatrogenic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Conivaptan has not been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. However, in theory, vasopressin receptor antagonism would be particularly useful in this setting, and an initial study shows that it has some promise.

==Medical uses==

Conivaptan is most commonly used in the hospital in cases of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, conditions where the sodium level in the blood falls significantly below normal. In the United States hyponatremia affects about four percent of hospitalized patients. Although many patients do not show symptoms, extreme cases may result in brain swelling, respiratory arrest and even death. Hypervolemic hyponatremia specifically is when the body’s serum sodium levels fall below the total body water increase, which results in edema. This is associated with congestive heart failure, liver disease and kidney failure.

==Pharmacology== 
Conivaptan hydrochloride is an arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonist with affinity for human V1A and V2 receptors in the nanomolar range in vitro. AVP levels in blood are crucial for water and electrolyte regulation and balance. V2 receptors maintain plasma osmolality and are coupled to aquaporin channels in the collecting ducts of kidneys where they regulate AVP levels. 
Conivaptan hydrochloride functions by antagonizing V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts and thus causing aquaresis or water secretion. Typical pharmacodynamic effects of the drug are an increase in net fluid loss, increase in urine output, and decrease in the osmolality of urine. 
Conivaptan inhibits its own metabolism in the body, displaying non-linear pharmacokinetics. About 99% of conivaptan found is bound to human plasma proteins over the range of 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL. The mean half-life of the drug is 5 hours and mean clearance is 15.2 L/hr.

==Adverse effects== 
Most adverse reactions to conivaptan are found at the site of infusion. Other complications include blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders as well as vascular disorders. There is risk of too rapid correction of hyponatremia causing fatal osmotic demyelination syndrome.

==Chemistry== 
Conivaptan hydrochloride is an off-white or a pale yellow power with a solubility of 0.25 mg/mL in water at 23 °C. The injectable formulation consists of 20 mg conivaptan hydrochloride, 0.4 g ethanol, 1.2 g propylene glycol and water.

==Development and commercialization== 
Conivaptan hydrochloride was discovered by Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals and marketed by Astellas. Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals filed a new drug application to the FDA for conivaptan hydrochloride to treat hyponatremia on 2 February 2004. On 1 December, Yamanouchi received approval for investigational hyponatremia treatment using conivaptan hydrochloride. Yamanouchi pharmaceuticals and Fujisawa Pharmaceuticlas merged and were renamed as Astellas’ in 2005. Astellas gained FDA approval for Conivaptan hydrochloride on 29 December 2005, and marked the drug under the brand name of Vaprisol in 2006.

On 2 March 2007, vaprisol also gained FDA approval for the treatment of hypervolemia hyponatremia. On 22 October 2008, Vaprisol further gained approval as a 5% Dextrose premixed formulation for the treatment of hyponatremia. In 2014 Cumberland pharmaceuticals bought Vaprisol from Astellas and took full responsibility of all development and marketing of the drug.

Cumberland Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company based in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to Vaprisol, Cumberland produces Acetadote, Caldolor, Kristalose, Omeclamox, and Ethyol. Hepatoren, Boxban, Vasculan, and currently in phase II clinical trials. Protaban, Methotrexate, and Totect are waiting for pre-approval.

<text>Racha (also Račha, , &quot;Račʼa&quot;) is a highland area in western Georgia, located in the upper Rioni river valley and hemmed in by the Greater Caucasus mountains. Under Georgia&#x27;s current subdivision, Racha is included in the Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti region (mkhare) as the municipalities of Oni and Ambrolauri. Native inhabitants of Racha are called Rachians, an ethnographic group of Georgians.

Racha occupies 2,854 km2 in the north-eastern corner of western Georgia. Spurs of the Greater Caucasus crest separates Racha from the Georgian historical regions of Svaneti and Lechkhumi on the north-west and from Imereti on the south, while the main Caucasus ridge forms a boundary with Russia’s North Ossetia. On the east, Racha is bordered by breakaway South Ossetia, officially part of Georgia&#x27;s Shida Kartli region.

==History==
Racha had been part of Colchis and Caucasian Iberia since ancient times and its main town Oni was said to have been founded by King Parnajom of Iberia in the 2nd century BC. Upon the creation of the unified Georgian kingdom in the 11th century, Racha became one of the duchies (saeristavo) within it. Rati of the Baghvashi family was the first duke (eristavi) appointed by King Bagrat III. Descendants of Rati and his son Kakhaber, eponymous father of Racha&#x27;s ruling dynasty of Kakhaberisdze, governed the province until 1278. In 1278 King David VI Narin abolished the duchy during his war against the Mongols. In the mid-14th century, the duchy was restored under the rule of the Charelidze family.

The next dynasty of Chkhetidze governed Racha from 1465 to 1769. Vassals of the King of Imereti, they revolted several times against the royal power. The 1678–1679 civil war resulted in the most serious consequences. In this war, Duke Shoshita II of Racha (1661–1684) supported Prince Archil, a rival of the pro-Ottoman Imeretian king Bagrat IV. On the defeat of Archil, Racha was overrun and plundered by an Ottoman punitive force. Under Rostom (1749–1769), the duchy became virtually independent from Imereti. However, towards the end of 1769, King Solomon I of Imereti managed to arrest Rostom and to abolish the duchy. In 1784, King David II of Imereti revived the duchy and gave it to his nephew Anton. Local opposition attempted to use an Ottoman force to take control of Racha, but the victory of King David at Skhvava (January 26, 1786) temporarily secured his dominance in the area. In 1789, the next Imeretian king Solomon II finally abolished the duchy and subordinated the province directly to the royal administration.

<doc id="1307385" wikidata="Q317291" url="?curid=1307385" title="Abdul Haris Nasution">
<text>Abdul Haris Nasution (; 3 December 1918 – 6 September 2000) was a high-ranking Indonesian general and politician. He served in the military during the Indonesian National Revolution and he remained in the military during the subsequent turmoil of the Parliamentary democracy and Guided Democracy. Following the fall of President Sukarno from power, he became the Speaker of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly under President Suharto. Born into a Batak Muslim family, in the village of Hutapungkut, Dutch East Indies, he studied teaching and enrolled at a military academy in Bandung.

He became a member of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, but following the Japanese invasion, he joined the Defenders of the Homeland. Following the proclamation of independence, he enlisted in the fledgling Indonesian armed forces and fought during the Indonesian National Revolution. In 1946, he was appointed commander of the Siliwangi Division, the guerrilla unit operating in West Java. After the end of the national revolution, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the army, until he was suspended for his involvement in the 17 October affair. He was reappointed to the position in 1955.

In 1965, an attempted coup occurred, later officially blamed on the Communist Party of Indonesia. Nasution&#x27;s house was attacked, and his daughter was killed, but he managed to escape by scaling a wall and hiding in the Iraqi ambassador&#x27;s residence. In the following political turmoil, he assisted in the rise of President Suharto and was appointed Speaker of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly. He had a falling-out with Suharto, who saw him as a rival, and he was pushed out of power in 1971. Once he was removed from positions of power, Nasution developed into a political opponent of Suharto&#x27;s New Order Regime, though he and Suharto began to reconcile in the 1990s. He died on 6 September 2000 in Jakarta, after suffering a stroke and going into a coma. His body was interred at Kalibata Heroes&#x27; Cemetery.

== Early life ==

Nasution was born on 3 December 1918 in the village of Hutapungkut, Mandailing Natal Regency, North Sumatra, into a Batak Muslim of Mandailing family. He was the second child of his parents and the oldest son. His father was a trader who sold textiles, rubber, and coffee and was a member of the Sarekat Islam organisation. His very religious father wanted his son to study at a religious school, while his mother wanted him to study medicine in Batavia. However, after graduating from school in 1932, Nasution received a scholarship to study teaching at Bukitinggi. In 1935 Nasution moved to Bandung to continue his studies, where he remained for three years. His desire to be a teacher gradually faded as his interest in politics grew. He secretly bought books written by the Indonesian nationalist Sukarno and read them with his friends. Following his graduation in 1937, Nasution returned to Sumatra and taught in Bengkulu, living near the house where Sukarno lived in exile. He occasionally spoke with Sukarno and heard him give speeches. A year later Nasution moved to Tanjungraja, near Palembang, where he continued to teach, but became more and more interested in politics and the military.

In 1940, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands and the Dutch colonial authorities established an officer reserve corps that admitted pribumi (native Indonesians). Nasution applied to join, as this was the only way to obtain military training. Along with a few other Indonesians, he was sent to the Bandung Military Academy for training. In September 1940 he was promoted to corporal, then three months later to sergeant. He subsequently became an officer in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL). In 1942 the Japanese invaded and occupied Indonesia. At the time, Nasution was in Surabaya, having been posted there to defend the port. Nasution then found his way back to Bandung and went into hiding, as he was afraid of being arrested by the Japanese. However, he later assisted the Japanese-backed PETA militias by carrying messages but did not become a member.

== Indonesian National Revolution ==

=== Siliwangi Division ===

After Sukarno declared Indonesia&#x27;s independence on 17 August 1945, Nasution joined the fledgling Indonesian Army, then known as the People&#x27;s Security Army (TKR), which was fighting the Indonesian National Revolution against the Dutch. In May 1946, he was appointed Regional Commander of the Siliwangi Division, which looked after the security of West Java. In this position, Nasution developed the theory of territorial warfare which would become the future defense doctrine of the Indonesian Army. In January 1948, the Indonesian Government and the Dutch Government signed the Renville Agreement, dividing Java between areas under Dutch and Indonesian control. Because the territories occupied by the Dutch included West Java, Nasution was forced to lead the Siliwangi Division across to Central Java and into Indonesian-controlled territory.

=== Deputy commander ===

1948 would also see Nasution rise to the position of Deputy TNI Commander. Despite being only a Colonel, this appointment made Nasution the most powerful person in the TNI, second only to the popular General Sudirman. Nasution immediately went to work in his new role. In April, he assisted Sudirman in reorganising the structure of the troops. In June, at a commanders&#x27; meeting, his suggestion that TNI should fight guerrilla warfare against the Dutch was approved. Although not the Commander of the TNI, Nasution gained experience in the role of Armed Forces Commander in September 1948 with the Madiun incident. Following the takeover of the city of Madiun in East Java, by former Prime Minister Amir Syarifuddin and Musso of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). When the news reached the TNI Headquarters in Yogyakarta, a meeting was held between senior military officers.

Sudirman was anxious to avoid violence and wanted negotiations to be conducted. Sudirman then commissioned Lieutenant Colonel Suharto, to negotiate a deal with the communists. After taking his trip, Suharto returned to Nasution and Sudirman and reported that everything seemed to be peaceful. Nasution did not trust this report and with Sudirman down with an illness, Nasution was left in charge. Nasution then decided on a crackdown, sending troops to go after the communists to put down and end the rebellion. On 30 September Madiun was taken over by republican troops of the Siliwangi Division. Thousands of communist party members were killed and 36,000 were imprisoned. Amongst the executed were several leaders including Musso, who was killed on 31 October, allegedly while trying to escape from prison. Other PKI leaders such as D.N. Aidit went into exile in China.

On 19 December 1948, the Dutch launched a successful attack on Yogyakarta and occupied it. Nasution, together with the TNI and the other commanders, retreated into the countryside to fight a guerrilla war. With President Sukarno and Vice-President Mohammad Hatta in Dutch captivity, the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was set up in Sumatra. In this interim government, Nasution was given the position of the Army and Territorial Commander of Java. Following Dutch recognition of Indonesia&#x27;s independence, the PDRI returned its powers to Sukarno and Hatta, and Nasution returned to his position as Deputy Commander to Sudirman.

== Parliamentary democracy era ==
=== First term as chief of staff ===
In December 1949, Nasution took on his position as army chief of staff, with T. B. Simatupang replacing Sudirman as the commander of the newly dubbed TNI (Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia). In 1952, Nasution and Simatupang decided to adopt a policy of restructuring and reorganisation for TNI. Under this arrangement, Nasution and Simatupang hoped to create a smaller army but one that was more modern and professional. It did not take long, however, before factional interests came into play. Nasution and Simatupang, who had both been trained by the Dutch colonial government wanted to discharge the soldiers trained by the Japanese and integrate more soldiers trained by the Dutch. The Japanese-trained troops, led by Bambang Supeno, began speaking out against this policy. In adopting their policy, Nasution and Simatupang had the backing of Prime Minister Wilopo and Defense Minister Hamengkubuwono IX. However, Supeno managed to find support from among the opposition parties in the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR). The DPR members then began making their disagreements on the restructuring of TNI known. Nasution and Simatupang were not happy to see what they perceived to be interference in military affairs by civilians. On 17 October 1952, Nasution and Simatupang mobilised their troops in a show of force. Protesting against civilian interference in military affairs, Nasution and Simatupang had their troops surround the Presidential Palace and point their tank turrets at it. Their demand to Sukarno was that the current DPR be dismissed.

For this cause, Nasution and Simatupang also mobilised civilian protesters. Sukarno came out of the Presidential Palace and convinced both soldiers and civilians to go home. Nasution and Simatupang had been defeated. Nasution and Simatupang were then questioned by Attorney General Suprapto. In December 1952, they both lost their positions in ABRI and were suspended from the service.

=== Second term as chief of staff ===

On 27 October 1955, after three years of exile, Nasution was re-appointed to his old position as Army Chief of Staff. He immediately began working on the army and its structure by adopting a threefold approach. First, he formulated a tour of duty system so that officers would be stationed around the country and gain experience. This would also result in army officers being more professional, instead of feeling personal attachment and loyalty to the province and region they came from. Nasution&#x27;s second change was to centralise military training. All training methods would now be uniform, instead of regional commanders setting up their methods. Nasution&#x27;s third and most important reform was to increase the army&#x27;s influence and power so that it would be able to take care of itself, instead of relying on civilian decisions. Nasution did not have a problem applying the first two changes, but he would have to wait to apply the third. By 1957, President Sukarno had begun to introduce the concept of Guided Democracy, in response to his disenchantment with the Parliamentary Democracy approach which Indonesia had adopted since November 1945. In this, he found a common bond with Nasution and the army, who still harboured resentment of civilian interference with army affairs in 1952.

On 14 March 1957, after the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and his Cabinet, Sukarno declared a State of Emergency. This move not only ended Sukarno&#x27;s merely ceremonial presidential role but also increased the army&#x27;s influence and power as Nasution had wished for. Under this arrangement, regional commanders were able to interfere in civilian matters such as the economy and administrative matters. At the behest of Sukarno himself, the army also began participating in politics, filling in positions that ranged from cabinet ministers to provincial governors and even DPR members. In December 1957, Nasution further increased the army&#x27;s role by ordering officers to take over the recently nationalised Dutch companies. Aside from increasing the army&#x27;s role, this move was also designed to stop the influence of the increasingly powerful PKI. In 1958, Nasution made a speech that would become the basis for the &quot;Dwifungsi&quot; Doctrine which the Suharto regime would adopt. Speaking at Magelang in Central Java, Nasution declared that ABRI should adopt a &quot;middle way in its approach to the nation. According to Nasution, ABRI should not be under the control of civilians. At the same time, ABRI should not dominate the nation in such a way that it became a military dictatorship.

In late 1956, there were demands by regional commanders in Sumatra for more autonomy in the provinces. When these demands were not met by the central government, the troops began to rebel, and by early 1957, had forcefully taken over the governance of Sumatra. Then, on 15 February 1958, Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Husein declared the establishment of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI). This prompted the central government to deploy troops. As army chief of staff, Nasution would normally have been involved in mobilising the troops to Sumatra. However, it would be his second deputy, Colonel Ahmad Yani who would make his name by successfully putting down the rebellions. On 5 July 1959, Sukarno issued a decree declaring that Indonesia would now revert to the original 1945 Constitution. Parliamentary democracy system would be ended and Sukarno was now the Head of Government in addition to being the Head of State. Nasution was appointed minister of defense and security in Sukarno&#x27;s Cabinet while continuing to hold the position as army chief of staff.

== Guided Democracy era ==

=== Corruption in the army ===

Since 1956, Nasution had been trying to stamp out corruption in the army, but the return to the 1945 Constitution seemed to have renewed his resolve in this matter. He believed that the army should set an example for the rest of society. Not long after Sukarno&#x27;s decree, Nasution sent Brigadier General Sungkono to investigate the financial dealings of Military Area Command IV/Diponegoro (Kodam) and its commander, Colonel Suharto. Sungkono&#x27;s findings revealed that during his time as regional commander, Suharto had set up foundations to help local people. However, these foundations were funded through compulsory levies (instead of voluntary donations) on production and service industries.

Suharto was also involved in illegally bartering sugar for rice with Thailand. Nasution wanted to take action against Suharto and considered expelling him from the army. However, Deputy Army Chief of Staff Gatot Soebroto intervened. Gatot had taken Suharto under his wing when he was Commander of Kodam IV/Diponegoro and had noticed Suharto&#x27;s talents. Gatot asked Nasution not to expel Suharto because Suharto&#x27;s talent could be further developed. Nasution listened to Gatot&#x27;s advice. He decided to remove Suharto from his position and to punish him by sending him to the Army Staff College (Seskoad).

=== West Irian ===

During the struggle for independence, Sukarno had always perceived Indonesia as also including West Papua. When the Dutch finally recognised Indonesia&#x27;s independence, West Papua continued to be a Dutch colony. Sukarno did not give up and continued to push for it to be included as part of Indonesia through the United Nations and through the Bandung Conference, where the attending nations promised to support Indonesia&#x27;s claim. The Dutch remained adamant and by 1960, Sukarno had run out of patience. In July, he met with his top advisors, including Nasution, and it was agreed that Indonesia would pursue a policy of confrontation against the Dutch on the matter of West Papua. As part of the preparation for this campaign, Nasution turned to Suharto, who had finished his Seskoad course in November 1960.

Suharto, now a brigadier general, was commissioned by Nasution to create a strategic force unit that would be on standby, ready to be called into action at any time. Suharto was placed in charge of this task force and in March 1961, the General Army Reserve (Caduad) was formed, with Suharto being appointed as its commander. Caduad would in 1963 change its name to the Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad). At the beginning of 1962, Nasution and Yani were the overall commanders of the so-called Liberation of West Irian, with Suharto stationed in east Indonesia as the field commander.

=== Rivalry with the Communists ===

Around this time, Sukarno had begun to see the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) instead of the army as his main political ally. Although he had set Indonesia on a non-aligned course during the Cold War, the revelation that the PRRI was assisted by the United States, caused Sukarno to adopt an anti-American stance. In this, he had the PKI as a natural ally. For the PKI, an alliance with Sukarno would only add to its political momentum as its influence continued to grow in Indonesian politics. Nasution was wary of the PKI&#x27;s influence over Sukarno and in turn, Sukarno was aware that Nasution was not happy about the PKI&#x27;s influence and made a move to weaken his power. In July 1962, Sukarno reorganised the structure of ABRI. The status of the heads of the Armed Forces branches would now be upgraded from chief of staff to commander. As commanders, the heads of the armed forces branches would have more power and would answer only to Sukarno as the Supreme Commander of ABRI.

Assisting Sukarno as supreme commander of ABRI would be an ABRI chief of staff. Sukarno appointed Nasution to the position of ABRI chief of staff and appointed Yani as the army commander. By doing this, Sukarno had decreased Nasution&#x27;s powers as the ABRI chief of staff was only responsible for administrative matters and commenced no troops. Now in a powerless position, Nasution began to think of other ways to stop the PKI&#x27;s momentum. The right moment came at the Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPRS) General Session in May 1963. During the General Session, Nasution had the Indonesian National Party (PNI) as well as the Army members present put forward the motion that Sukarno be appointed president for life. The rationale behind this was that with Sukarno being appointed president for life, there would be no elections, and without elections, the PKI would not be able to get in power no matter how much the party grew. The motion was carried through and Sukarno became president for life.

=== Division with Yani ===

Nasution soon began developing an attitude of hostility towards Yani. Both Nasution and Yani were anti-communists, but their attitude towards Sukarno was different. Nasution was critical of Sukarno for backing and supporting the PKI, while Yani, a Sukarno loyalist, adopted a softer stance. Nasution criticised Yani&#x27;s soft stance and relations between the two soured. To make matters worse, Yani began replacing regional commanders who were close to Nasution with those who were close to himself. On 13 January 1965, a delegation of officers representing Nasution and Yani met in an attempt to reconcile the differences between the two officers.

The meeting was unsuccessful in persuading Yani to distance himself from Sukarno, but delegates agreed to hold seminars where officers could talk about the current political climate and the role of the army in politics. As the year went on, a document was circulated in Jakarta. Dubbed the Gilchrist Document, it was a letter purporting to come from British ambassador Andrew Gilchrist, and mentioned &quot;our local army friends&quot;. Suspicion was immediately cast on the army wanting to launch a coup. Although Yani was quick to deny the allegations, the PKI began running a smear campaign, claiming that a Council of Generals was planning to overthrow the president. As the most senior officers in the Army, Nasution and Yani were implicated to be part of this Council.

== G30S and Transition to New Order ==

=== Kidnapping attempt ===

On the morning of 1 October 1965, troops calling themselves the 30 September Movement (G30S) attempted to kidnap seven anti-communist Army officers including Nasution. Lieutenant Arief was the leader of the squad assigned to capture Nasution, and his team in four trucks and two military cars travelled down a deserted Jalan Teuku Umar at 4:00 am. Nasution&#x27;s home was at No. 40, a modest single-story home. The guard in the sentry box outside the house saw the vehicles coming, but upon seeing the men were soldiers he was not suspicious and did not call his superior, Sergeant Iskaq, who was in charge of the army detail guarding the house. The sergeant was in a guardroom in the front room along with half a dozen soldiers some of whom were asleep. A guard was asleep in the front garden and another was on duty at the rear of the house. In a separate cottage, two of Nasution&#x27;s aides were asleep, a young army lieutenant Pierre Tendean, and assistant police commissioner Hamdan Mansjur.

Before the alarm could be raised, Arief&#x27;s squad had jumped the fence and overpowered the sleepy guards in the sentry box and guard room. Others entered from around the side of the house and covered it from the rear. About fifteen soldiers broke into the house. Both Nasution and his wife were bothered by mosquitoes and were awake. Neither heard the guards being overpowered but Mrs Nasution heard a door being forced. She got out of bed to check and on opening the bedroom door, she saw a Cakrabirawa (presidential bodyguard) soldier with a gun ready to shoot. She slammed the door shut and yelled a warning to her husband. Nasution wanted to take a look himself and when he opened the door, the soldier shot at him. He flung himself to the floor and his wife slammed and locked the door. The men on the other side began to smash the door down and fired a volley of shots into the bedroom. Mrs. Nasution pushed her husband out through another door and down a corridor to a side entrance to the house. He dashed across his garden to the wall separating his garden and that of neighbouring Iraqi ambassador. He was spotted by soldiers who fired off a volley of shots but missed. Scaling the wall, Nasution, broke his ankle as he fell into the ambassador&#x27;s garden to hide. He was not pursued.

The entire Nasution household was awakened and frightened by the shooting. Nasution&#x27;s mother and sister, Mardiah, also lived in the house and ran to his bedroom. Mardiah grabbed Nasution&#x27;s five-year-old daughter, Irma, from her bed, cradling the child protectively in her arms, and tried to run to safety. As she ran past, a corporal from the palace guard fired a round of shots at her through a door. Mardiah was hit in the hand and Irma received three bullets in her spine. She died five days later in hospital. Nasution&#x27;s eldest daughter, 13-year-old Janti, and her nurse Alfiah had run to the cottage housing Nasution&#x27;s aides and hid under a bed.

Tendean loaded his weapon and ran from the house, but was caught within a few steps. In the darkness, he was mistaken for Nasution and taken away at gunpoint. After pushing her husband out of the house, Mrs Nasution ran inside and picked up her wounded daughter. As she phoned for a doctor, Cakrabirawa troops demanded she tell them her husband&#x27;s whereabouts. Reportedly she had a brief and angry exchange with Arief telling him that Nasution had been out of town for a few days. A whistle blew outside and the men in the house left taking Tendean with them. The whole affair had taken nine minutes. Mrs Nasution took her wounded daughter to the Central military hospital and guards sounded the alarm. The Jakarta garrison commander, Major General Umar Wirahadikusumah, rushed to the Nasution home.

A guard outside the house of Johannes Leimena, a neighbour of Nasution&#x27;s and one of Indonesia&#x27;s three deputy premiers, heard the commotion and walked down to the Nasution house. In the confusion, the guard was shot and killed. This led to stories of Lemeina being on the plotter&#x27;s list and of an attack on Lemeina&#x27;s house. However, the killing of the guard was unplanned.

Nasution continued hiding in the garden of his neighbour until 6 am when he returned to his house with a broken ankle. Nasution then asked his adjutants to take him to the Ministry of Defense and Security because he thought it would be safer there. He was driven there crouching on the floor of a car. Nasution then sent a message to Suharto at Kostrad headquarters, telling him that he was alive and safe. After knowing that Suharto was taking command of the army, Nasution then ordered him to take measures such as finding the whereabouts of the president, contacting navy commander RE Martadinata, marine corps commander Hartono as well as the chief of police Sucipto Judodiharjo, and securing Jakarta by closing off all roads leading up to it. The air force was excluded because its Commander Omar Dhani was suspected of being a G30S sympathiser. Suharto immediately integrated these orders into his plan to secure the city.

At around 2 pm, after the G30S Movement announced the formation of a Revolutionary Council, Nasution sent another order to Suharto, Martadinata, and Judodiharjo. In the order, Nasution said that he was convinced that Sukarno had been kidnapped and taken to the G30S headquarters in Halim. He therefore ordered ABRI to free the president, restore security to Jakarta, and most importantly, appointed Suharto to head the operations. Just as Suharto began working, however, a message came from Sukarno at Halim. Sukarno had decided to appoint Major General Pranoto Reksosamudro – a Sukarno loyalist – to the position of Army Commander and now wanted Pranoto to come to see him. Suharto did not allow Pranoto to go but he knew that Sukarno would not give up in trying to summon Pranoto. To strengthen his bargaining position, Suharto asked Nasution to come to the Kostrad Headquarters.

Nasution arrived at the Kostrad headquarters at around 6 pm, just as Suharto began deploying Sarwo Edhie Wibowo&#x27;s troops to secure Jakarta from the G30S Movement. There, Nasution finally received first aid for his broken ankle. Once Jakarta was safely secured, Martadinata came to the Kostrad headquarters with a copy of the Presidential Decree which appointed Pranoto. After seeing the decree, Suharto invited Martadinata and Nasution into a room to discuss the situation.

Nasution asked Martadinata how the president came to appoint Pranoto. Martadinata replied that during the afternoon he, Judodiharjo, and Dhani had attended a meeting with Sukarno at Halim to decide who should become the army commander now that Yani was dead. The meeting had decided that Pranoto should become army commander. Nasution said that Sukarno&#x27;s appointment could not be accepted as the appointment came when Suharto had begun with the operations. Nasution also added that he would back Suharto&#x27;s decision to not let Pranoto go to Halim. Nasution and Suharto then invited Pranoto in and convinced him to delay accepting his appointment as army commander until after Suharto finished putting down the attempted coup d&#x27;état.

With Sarwo Edhie&#x27;s troops, Jakarta was quickly secured. Suharto then turned his attention to Halim and began making preparations to attack the air base. To assist him, Nasution ordered the navy and the police to assist Suharto in putting down the G30S Movement. To the Air Force, Nasution issued an order saying that they would not be charged with insubordination if they refused to obey Dhani&#x27;s orders. By 6 am on 2 October, Halim was overtaken and the G30S Movement was officially put down.

=== Missed opportunity ===

Although Suharto had been the man of the hour on 1 October, many of the other Army officers still turned to Nasution for leadership and had expected him to take more decisive control of the situation. However, Nasution seemed indecisive, and slowly but surely the support began to swing away from him. Perhaps this reason was because he was still grieving over his daughter, Ade Irma, who died on 6 October. In the first few weeks after G30S, Nasution was the one who constantly lobbied Sukarno to have Suharto appointed Army Commander. Sukarno, who after 1 October wanted to keep Pranoto, had originally only made Suharto the Commander of Kopkamtib, but with Nasution&#x27;s constant lobbying, Sukarno was finally persuaded and on 14 October 1965, appointed Suharto as the army commander. A golden opportunity came to Nasution in December 1965 when there was talk of his being appointed as vice president to assist Sukarno in times of uncertainty. Nasution did not capitalise on this and chose to do nothing. Suharto, whose political momentum was growing, took the initiative in early 1966 by issuing a statement saying that there was no need to fill the vacant vice presidency.

On 24 February 1966, Nasution was removed from his position as Minister of Defense and Security in a cabinet reshuffle. The position of ABRI Chief of Staff was also abolished. By this stage, the expectation that Nasution would do something was now gone as army officers and student movements alike rallied behind Suharto. Nevertheless, he continued to be a respected figure as many army officers visited him in the days leading up to the signing of the Supersemar document handing over authority from Sukarno to Suharto. When Suharto was about to go to the Kostrad Headquarters to wait for the delivery of the Supersemar, he called Nasution and asked him for his blessing. Nasution&#x27;s wife gave the blessing on behalf of Nasution, who was not present. Nasution&#x27;s political senses seemed to have returned after Suharto received the Supersemar. It was perhaps he who first realised that Supersemar not only gave Suharto emergency powers but also gave him executive control. On 12 March 1966, after Suharto had the PKI banned, Nasution suggested to Suharto that he form an emergency Cabinet. Suharto, still cautious about what he could or could not do with his new powers replied that forming a cabinet was the responsibility of the president. Nasution encouraged Suharto, promising him full support but Suharto did not respond and the conversation ended abruptly.

=== Chairman of the MPRS ===

With his new powers, Suharto began purging the government of what he perceived to be communist influence. After the arrest of 15 cabinet ministers on 18 March 1966, Suharto went after the Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPRS), removing members thought to be communist sympathizers and replacing them with members more sympathetic to the army&#x27;s cause. During the purge, the MPRS also lost its chairman, Chaerul Saleh, and there was a need to fill in the vacant position. Nasution was an overwhelmingly popular choice as all of the factions in the MPRS nominated him for the position of MPRS chairman. However, Nasution waited until Suharto expressed support for his nomination before accepting the nomination. On 20 June 1966, the MPRS General Session began. Nasution set Supersemar (Order of the Eleventh of March) as the first agenda on the list by walking into the assembly hall with the physical document. The next day, on 21 June, the MPRS ratified Supersemar, making it illegal for Sukarno to withdraw it.

On 22 June, Sukarno delivered a speech entitled Nawaksara (Nine Points) in front of the assembly. Nasution and the other MPRS members, who had hoped for Sukarno&#x27;s account of G30S were disappointed. Nothing about the G30S was mentioned. Instead, Sukarno seemed to give an account of his appointment as president for life, his plan of work as president, and how the Constitution worked in practice. This MPRS would refuse to ratify this speech. Over the next two weeks, Nasution presided over a busy MPRS General Session. Under his Chairmanship, the MPRS took measures such as banning Marxism-Leninism, revoking Sukarno&#x27;s life presidency, and ordering a legislative election to be held by July 1968. The MPRS General Session also increased Suharto&#x27;s power by officially ordering him to formulate a new cabinet. A decree was also passed which stated that if the president was unable to carry out his duties, he would now be replaced by the holder of the Supersemar instead of the vice-president.

As 1966 wore on, Sukarno was increasingly on the defensive and his popularity was at an all-time low. Suharto, who knew that his political victory was near, took to playing the role of the polite Javanese by constantly giving Sukarno reassuring words and defending him from the protests. Other generals such as Nasution were not as merciful, as the year drew to a close, Nasution claimed that Sukarno should be held responsible for the dire situation in which his Government left Indonesia. Nasution also called for Sukarno to be taken to trial. On 10 January 1967, Nasution and the MPRS assembled again as Sukarno submitted his report (he did not deliver it in person as a speech) which was hoped to finally address the issue of G30S. Dubbed the &quot;Pelengkap Nawaksara&quot; (Nawaksara Addendum), the report spoke about Sukarno&#x27;s insistence on calling G30S the 1 October Movement (Gestok). On G30S, Sukarno said that PKI made a big mistake on the morning of 1 October but also added that this was due to the cunning of the neo-colonialists.

In a subtle jab towards Nasution, Sukarno added that if he was going to be blamed for the G30S, the Minister of Defense and Security at the time should also be blamed for not seeing the G30S coming and stopping it before it happened. The report was once again rejected by the MPRS. In February 1967, the DPR called for an MPRS Special Session in March to replace Sukarno with Suharto. Sukarno seemed resigned to his fate, officially handing day-to-day control of the Government to Suharto on 22 February 1967 and requiring him only to report if necessary. Finally, on 12 March 1967, Sukarno was officially removed from power by the MPRS. Nasution then swore Suharto into office as the acting president. A year later on 27 March 1968, Nasution presided over Suharto&#x27;s election and inauguration as full President.

== In the New Order ==

=== Fall from power and opposition ===

Despite the assistance that Nasution gave him in his rise to power, Suharto viewed Nasution as a rival and immediately began working to remove him from power. In 1969, Nasution was barred from speaking at Seskoad and the Military Academy. In 1971, Nasution was suddenly discharged from military service at the age of 53, two years before the designated retirement age of 55. Nasution was finally removed in 1972 as the new batch of MPR members (elected during the 1971 legislative election) came in and elected Idham Chalid to replace him as MPR chairman. Nasution&#x27;s drastic fall earned him the nickname of &quot;gelandangan politik&quot; (political bum). Once he was removed from positions of power, Nasution developed into a political opponent of the New Order regime. By the late 70s, Suharto&#x27;s regime had turned from popular to authoritarian and corrupt. At this time many voices began to openly speak out and criticise the regime. After the 1977 legislative election, in which there was alleged electoral fraud by Suharto&#x27;s Golkar party, Nasution said that there was a crisis in leadership in the New Order.

In July 1978, together with former vice-president Hatta, Nasution set up the Institute for Constitutional Awareness Foundation (YLKB). Suharto&#x27;s government moved quickly and did not allow YLKB to conduct its first meeting in January 1979. Nasution and the YLKB did not give up. In August 1979, it managed to hold a meeting which DPR members attended. Perhaps significantly, ABRI members attended the meeting. During the meeting, Nasution criticised the New Order for not fully implementing Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. Suharto did not take the criticism lightly. On 27 March 1980, at an ABRI Meeting, Suharto in a speech said that ABRI members should be ready to defend their seats in the DPR and that they should align themselves with forces that are for Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution such as Golkar. Suharto followed this up with another speech on 16 April 1980, on the occasion of Kopassus&#x27; anniversary. in which he denied allegations of corruption and claimed that if he had to, he would kidnap MPR members if that would prevent the MPR from having the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution.

Nasution then decided that the opponents of the regime should make a major statement. He gathered ABRI members who were disgruntled with the Suharto regime such as former governor of Jakarta Ali Sadikin, former chief of police Hoegeng Imam Santoso, and former deputy army chief of staff . Former prime ministers Mohammad Natsir and Burhanuddin Harahap as well as PDRI chairman Syafruddin Prawiranegara joined in. Together with many other well-known critics of the government, they signed a petition that would become known as &quot;Petisi 50&quot; (Petition of Fifty), so-called because there were 50 signatories. The petition was signed on 5 May 1980 and delivered to the DPR on 13 May 1980. It called for Suharto to stop interpreting Pancasila to suit his ends and for ABRI to be neutral in politics instead of favouring Golkar. The DPR, especially members of the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party took the petition seriously and asked Suharto to respond on the issue. Suharto replied that his speeches on 27 March 1980 and 16 April 1980 were sufficient response. He added if there were any problems, the DPR could pass a motion for a special investigation. Here the PPP and PDI members stopped, knowing that their motion would be defeated because of Golkar&#x27;s dominance. For signatories to the petition such as Nasution, Suharto imposed travel bans and made business dealings difficult so that the petition signatories would have a hard time making a living.

=== Reconciliation ===

By the beginning of the 1990s, Suharto was beginning to adopt a policy of political openness, and enforcement of the Petition of 50 Signatories&#x27; punishment was loosened. In June 1993, when he was in hospital because of illness, Nasution was visited by the army&#x27;s top brass. He then received a visit from BJ Habibie, Suharto&#x27;s Minister of Technology. Habibie then invited Nasution and the other signatories to visit his shipyard and the aircraft factory which had been put under his jurisdiction. The government also began claiming that although there was a travel ban for the Petition of 50 Signatories, the ban did not apply to Nasution. For his part, Nasution denied criticising the government, preferring to call it a &quot;difference of opinion&quot;. Finally, in July 1993, Suharto invited Nasution to the Presidential Palace for a meeting. This was followed by another meeting on 18 August 1993, after the Independence Day celebrations. Nothing political was talked about, but it was clear that both men were keen to reconcile their differences.

In an interview in 1995, Nasution encouraged Indonesia to go through a reconciliation process so that the nation could be united under the leadership of Suharto. On 5 October 1997, on the occasion of ABRI&#x27;s anniversary, Nasution was given the honorary rank &quot;Jenderal Besar&quot;, a rank that he shared with Suharto and Sudirman.

== Death ==

Nasution died on 6 September 2000 in Jakarta after suffering a stroke and going into a coma. He was buried at the Kalibata Heroes&#x27; Cemetery, South Jakarta.

== Family ==

Nasution was married to Johanna Sunarti (1 November 1923 – 20 March 2010), a Surabaya-born humanitarian, with whom he had two daughters, Hendriyanti Sahara (1952 – 18 June 2021) and Ade Irma Suryani.

== Miscellaneous ==

Umar Wirahadikusumah served as Nasution&#x27;s adjutant from 1946 to 1947.

The former residence of Nasution at Jl Teuku Umar No 40, Menteng, in central Jakarta has been converted into a museum.

<text>The Ford Bronco is a model line of SUVs manufactured and marketed by Ford. The first SUV model developed by the company, five generations of the Bronco were sold from the 1966 to 1996 model years. A sixth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2021 model year. The nameplate has been used on other Ford SUVs, namely the 1984–1990 Bronco II compact SUV and the 2021 Bronco Sport compact crossover.

Originally developed as a compact off-road vehicle using its own chassis, the Bronco initially competed against the Jeep CJ-5 and International Scout. For 1978, Ford enlarged the Bronco, making it a short-wheelbase version of the F-Series pickup truck; the full-size Bronco now competed against the Chevrolet K5 Blazer and Dodge Ramcharger.

Following a decline in demand for large two-door SUVs, Ford discontinued the Bronco after the 1996 model year, replacing it with the four-door Ford Expedition; followed by the larger Ford Excursion. After a 25-year hiatus, the sixth-generation Bronco is now offered as a mid-size two-door SUV for the first time. It is also offered as a full-size four-door SUV with a longer wheelbase. It competes directly with the Jeep Wrangler as both a two-door and a four-door (hardtop) convertible.

From 1965 to 1996, the Ford Bronco was manufactured by Ford at its Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where it also manufactures the sixth-generation version.


== First generation (1966) ==
The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey in the early 1960s (who also conceived the Ford Mustang) and was engineered by Paul G. Axelrad, with Lee Iacocca approving the final model for production in February 1964, after the first clay models were built in mid-1963. Developed as an off-road vehicle (ORV), the Bronco was intended as a competitor for the Jeep CJ-5, International Scout and Toyota Land Cruiser. Today a compact SUV in terms of size, Ford marketing shows a very early example of promoting a civilian off-roader as a &quot;Sports Utility&quot; (the two-door pickup version).

Initially selling well, there was a decline in demand for the Bronco following the introduction of the Chevrolet Blazer, Jeep Cherokee, and International Scout II (from 1969 to 1974), as demand shifted towards SUVs with better on-road capability.

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Bronco is built upon a chassis developed specifically for the model range, shared with no other Ford or Lincoln-Mercury vehicle. Built on a 92-inch wheelbase (sized between the CJ-5 and Scout; only an inch shorter than the later CJ-7), the Bronco used box-section body-on-frame construction.

To simplify production, all examples were sold with four-wheel drive; a shift-on the-fly Dana 20 transfer case and locking hubs were standard. The rear axle was a Ford 9-inch axle, with Hotchkiss drive and leaf springs; the front axle was a Dana 30, replaced by a Dana 44 in 1971. In contrast to the Twin I-Beams of larger Ford trucks, the Bronco used radius arms to locate the coil-sprung front axle, along with a lateral track bar, allowing for a 34-foot turning circle, long wheel travel, and antidive geometry (useful for snowplowing). A heavier-duty suspension system was an option, along with air front springs.

==== Powertrain ====
At its August 1965 launch, the Bronco was offered with a 170-cubic-inch inline six. Derived from the Ford Falcon, the 105-hp engine was modified with solid valve lifters, a oil pan, heavy-duty fuel pump, oil-bath air cleaner, and carburetor with a float bowl compensated against tilting. In March 1966, a 200-hp 289-cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option. For the 1969 model year, the 289 V8 was enlarged to 302 cubic inches, remaining through the 1977 model year. For 1973, a 200 cubic-inch inline six became the standard engine, offered through 1977.

To lower production costs, at its launch, the Bronco was offered solely with a three-speed, column-shifted manual transmission and floor-mounted transfer case shifter (with a floor-mounted transmission shifter later becoming a popular modification). In 1973, in response to buyer demand, a three-speed automatic transmission was offered as an option.

=== Body design ===
In a central theme of the first-generation Bronco, styling was subordinated to simplicity and economy, so all glass was flat, bumpers were straight C-sections, and the left and right door skins were symmetrical (prior to the fitment of door-mounting hardware).

For 1966, three Bronco body configurations were offered, including a two-door wagon, a half-cab pickup, and an open-body roadster. With a base price of $2,194 ($20,055 in 2022 dollars), the Bronco included few amenities as standard. However, a large number of options were offered through both Ford and its dealers, including front bucket seats, a rear bench seat, a tachometer, and a CB radio, as well as functional items such as a tow bar, an auxiliary gas tank, a power take-off, a snowplow, a winch, and a posthole digger. Aftermarket accessories included campers, overdrive units, and the usual array of wheels, tires, chassis, and engine parts for increased performance.

For 1967, Ford introduced the Sport option package for the Bronco wagon. Consisting primarily of chrome exterior trim and wheel covers, the Sport package was distinguished by red-painted &quot;FORD&quot; grille lettering. For 1970, the Bronco Sport became a freestanding model rather than an option package.

To comply with federal regulations, the Bronco was fitted with back-up lights and side marker lamps in 1967 and 1968, respectively. After struggling with sales, the open-body Bronco roadster was withdrawn after the 1968 model year.

After 1972, the Bronco half-cab was withdrawn; along with its lower sales compared to the wagon, Ford had introduced the larger Ford Courier compact pickup.

In a minor revision, for 1977, the exterior-mounted fuel tank caps were replaced behind hinged doors (as on all other Ford trucks).

=== Trim ===
Initially offered as a single trim level with a long option list, for 1967, Ford introduced the Sport option package for the Bronco wagon. Consisting primarily of chrome exterior trim and wheelcovers, the Sport package was distinguished by red-painted FORD grille lettering. For 1970, the Bronco Sport became a freestanding model rather than an option package.

For 1972, in line with the F-Series trucks, the Ranger trim became the top-of-the-line Bronco, offering body stripes, model-specific wheel covers, cloth seats, woodgrain door panels, and carpeted interior.

In a 1975 interior revision, the Bronco Sport and Bronco Ranger adapted the two-spoke steering wheel from the F-Series.

The optional full wheel covers on all first generation Broncos were the same ones used on the 1966 Galaxie.

=== Sales ===
=== Racing ===
In 1965, race car builder Bill Stroppe assembled a team of Broncos for long-distance off-road competition. Partnering with Holman-Moody, the Stroppe/Holman/Moody (SHM) Broncos competed in the Mint 400, Baja 500, and Mexican 1000 (later named the Baja 1000). In 1969, SHM again entered a team of six Broncos in the Baja 1000. In 1971, a &quot;Baja Bronco&quot; package was marketed through Ford dealers, featuring quick-ratio power steering, automatic transmission, fender flares covering Gates Commando tires, a roll bar, reinforced bumpers, a padded steering wheel, and distinctive red, white, blue, and black paint. Priced at US$5,566, versus the standard V8 Bronco price of $3,665, only 650 were sold over the next four years.

In 1966, a Bronco &quot;funny car&quot; built by Doug Nash for the quarter-mile dragstrip finished with a few low 8-second times, but it was sidelined by sanctioning organizations when pickups and aluminum frames were outlawed.

== Second generation (1978) ==
For the 1978 model year, the second-generation Bronco was introduced; to better compete with the Chevrolet K5 Blazer, Dodge Ramcharger, and Jeep Cherokee, the Bronco entered the full-size SUV segment. In place of a model-specific chassis, the Bronco was adapted directly from the Ford F-Series, becoming a shortened version of the F-100 4x4. Originally intended for a 1974 launch, the second-generation Bronco (named &quot;Project Shorthorn&quot; during its development) was postponed to 1978 in response to fuel economy concerns related to the 1973 fuel crisis; the second-generation Bronco was released for sale after development was nearly finalized on its 1980 successor.

In a notable break from a period of downsizing in the American automotive industry, the second-generation Bronco grew significantly in size, adding 12 inches of wheelbase, approximately 28 inches of length, 11 inches of width, and 4 inches of height; based on powertrain configuration, the Bronco gained 1,100 to 1,600 pounds of curb weight over its predecessor.

The second-generation Bronco marks the introduction of design commonality with the Ford F-Series and retained the lift-off hardtop body style for the three-door wagon, though now fiberglass over the rear seat area only (and not a full-length steel top), continued through the 1996 withdrawal of the model line. In spite of its short production cycle (only two years), the second-generation Bronco proved successful, overtaking the Blazer and Ramcharger in sales for the first time; initial demand was so strong that customers waited several months to receive vehicles from dealers.

=== Chassis ===
The second generation Bronco is based on the Ford F-100 pickup truck chassis (1973–1979 sixth generation). Approximately one foot shorter than the shortest F-100, the Bronco has a 104-inch wheelbase (12 inches longer than the previous Bronco). The second generation Bronco is still fitted exclusively with four-wheel drive; a part-time system was standard with a New Process 205 gear-driven transfer case with the option of permanent four-wheel drive and a New Process 203 chain-driven transfer case.

The second generation Bronco has a coil-sprung Dana 44 front axle and a leaf-sprung rear Ford 9-inch axle (similar to the later first generation Broncos). The first and second generation Broncos both have non-independent front suspension (solid front axle). Third generation and later have the Ford/Dana twin traction beam independent front suspension system. These were also later used in the Ford Transit 4x4 range.

Two different V8 engines were offered for the second generation Bronco: the 5.8L 351M and the 6.6L 400. While offering virtually the same horsepower output, the 400 produced a higher torque output over the 351M. As the 460 V8 was restricted to rear-wheel drive F-Series trucks, it was not offered in the Bronco.

For 1979, Ford added emissions controls to its light-truck engines; the Bronco gained a catalytic converter (among other equipment) in both engine configurations.
=== Body ===
Replacing the multiple body configurations of the first generation, the second-generation Bronco was offered solely as a 3-door wagon with a lift-off rear hardtop. During its development as Project Shorthorn, a central requirement by Ford was to adopt bodywork from the F-100 with minimal modification. As with its chassis, the second-generation Bronco derives much of its body from the F-Series truck line, sharing the doors, front roofline and sheetmetal, and interior with the F-Series.

Retaining the wagon body from its predecessor, Ford designers shifted from a full-length hardtop (as with the previous Bronco and on the Jeep CJ-7) to a lift-off hardtop from behind the B-pillars. Designed by Dick Nesbitt, the configuration achieved higher commonality with the F-100 (sharing the doors and overhead roof stamping); attention was focused on minimizing leaks around the top seals (a problem related to the design of the K5 Blazer hardtop of the time). In a configuration similar to the Ford LTD Country Squire, the glass of the rear window rolled down into the tailgate (via a dash-mounted switch or from using the key on the outside), allowing the tailgate to fold down.

Coinciding with its commonality with the F-100, the second-generation Bronco introduced features new to the model line for the first time, including air conditioning, radio, and tilt steering. While a two-seat interior remained standard, the 11-inch wider interior allowed for a three-passenger front bench seat; with a folding and removable rear seat, the Bronco became a six-passenger vehicle for the first time.

For 1979, the Bronco saw little change from 1978 models. Along with the F-Series, rectangular headlamps (introduced on the Ranger trim for 1978) became standard on all Broncos. In an interior revision, captain&#x27;s chair front seats became an option.
=== Trim ===
For the second-generation Bronco, the model line adopted the same trim nomenclature as the F-Series. The Bronco Custom served as the standard-trim model with the Bronco Ranger XLT as the top-level trim. For 1978, as with the F-Series trucks, Customs were fitted with round headlamps while Ranger XLTs had rectangular units, which became standard for all Broncos for 1979.

During 1978 and 1979, alongside the Econoline, F-Series, and Courier, the Bronco was sold with a &quot;Free-Wheelin″&quot; cosmetic option package for both Custom and Ranger XLT trims. Featuring tricolor striping and blacked-out exterior trim, the package featured revised exterior striping for 1979.

=== Sales ===
== Third generation (1980) ==

Beginning production development in 1977 (before its predecessor was released for sale) the 1980–1986 Bronco was designed to address many concerns that held the 1978–1979 Bronco out of production. Nominally shorter and lighter, the 1980 Bronco was designed to adopt a more efficient powertrain while retaining its full-size dimensions.

In 1982, the Ford Bronco II made its debut; unrelated to the full-size Bronco, the Bronco II was a compact SUV based on a shortened Ranger pickup truck and sized similarly to the 1966–1977 Bronco.

=== Chassis ===
Again based on the Ford F-Series, the 1980–1986 Bronco is based upon the Ford F-150 (1980–1986 seventh generation). Although based on an all-new chassis, the Bronco retained its wheelbase. Ford engineers attempting to get as much fuel economy from weight reduction of curb weight from the previous year, the 1980-81 models had a much weaker frame with holes stamped out at the factory. This extra lightened frame was dropped in 1982 for more strength and rigidity gaining curb weight. Both transfer cases were replaced with a New Process 208 or Borg Warner 1345 version.

In front, the 1980–1986 Bronco is fitted with a Dana 44 front axle with Ford TTB (Twin Traction Beam) independent front suspension. As with the 1978–1979 Bronco, the rear axle was first a leaf-sprung Ford 9-inch axle in early models, however Ford transitioned all half ton trucks to their 8.8 rear axle by the end of 1986.

For the first time since 1977, the Bronco came with an inline-six engine as standard; the 4.9L 300 I6 was available solely with a manual transmission. The 400 V8 was discontinued, with the 351M taking its place and the 302 V8 making its return as the base-equipment V8. The 351 Windsor made its debut in the Bronco as it replaced the 351M in 1982; gaining a 210 hp &quot;high-output&quot; version in 1984. In 1985, the 5.0L V8 (302) saw its carburetor replaced by a multiport electronic fuel-injection system, rising to 190 hp (the standard 156 hp 5.8L V8 was discontinued for 1986).

=== Body ===
As with its 1978–1979 predecessor, the 1980–1986 Bronco shares much of its external sheetmetal with the F-Series pickup line, with the same parts from the doors forward. Based on a design proposal originally used in the development of the previous-generation Bronco, the B-pillar of the roofline was modified slightly to produce an improved seal for the hardtop. Prior to 1984, the hardtop included sliding window glass as an option.

For 1982, the Bronco saw a slight facelift as it adopted Ford&#x27;s blue oval emblem, taking the place of &quot;F-O-R-D&quot; lettering on the hood, and the bronco horse was removed from the fender emblems.

=== Trim ===
The 1980–1986 Bronco adopted the same trim levels as the Ford F-Series pickups. Following the introduction of the Ford Ranger compact pickup, the Bronco adopted Bronco (base, replacing Custom), Bronco XL, and Bronco XLT.

In 1985, Ford added an Eddie Bauer trim package for the Bronco. Featuring a color-keyed two-tone exterior, the trim package featured an outdoors-themed interior.

=== Sales ===
=== Australian assembly ===
Outside of the US, the third generation Bronco was also assembled in Australia by Ford Australia, utilizing locally produced 4.1-litre six-cylinder and 5.8-litre V8 engines. It was marketed in Australia from March 1981 through to 1987.
== Fourth generation (1987) ==

For the 1987 model year, the fourth-generation Bronco was designed as a short-wheelbase version of the eighth-generation Ford F-150. Sharing its chassis with the previous generation, the 1987 Bronco was given a number of updates to both the exterior and interior. Sharing a common front fascia with the F-Series, the Bronco received a reshaped front bumper, flatter front grille, and reshaped hood; composite headlamps replaced the previous sealed-beam units. In another body revision, the wheel openings were reshaped. The interior was given redesigned front seats, door panels, dashboard and controls (including a new steering wheel), and instrument panels.

The Bronco returned its 4.9L inline-6, 5.0L V8, and the 5.8L H.O. V8 engines from the previous generations; first introduced on the 5.0L V8 in 1985, fuel injection was added to the inline-6 for 1987 and to the 5.8L V8 for 1988. For the 1988 model year, a Mazda-sourced 5-speed manual was introduced. The 3-speed C6 automatic was offered from 1987 to 1990, phased out in favor of the overdrive-equipped 4-speed AOD (1990 only) and heavier-duty E4OD (1990-1991).

In the interest of safety, rear-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS) became standard for the 1987 model. As an option, push-button control was introduced for the four-wheel drive system for 1987. For 1988, skid plates for the transfer case became standard equipment.

=== Special editions ===
To commemorate 25 years of production, Ford offered a Silver Anniversary Edition Bronco for the 1991 model year. A cosmetic option package, the Silver Anniversary Edition featured Currant Red exterior paint (package exclusive) and a gray leather interior (the first time leather seating was available for a Bronco).

For 1991 through 1992, the Nite option package featured a completely blacked-out exterior with contrasting graphics. Alongside the top-line Eddie Bauer trim, both special editions were available only with a V8 engine and automatic transmission.

=== Sales ===


== Fifth generation (1992) ==

For the 1992 model year, the fifth-generation Bronco followed the design development of the ninth-generation Ford F-150. Again retaining the chassis introduced for the 1980 model year, the front fascia of the Bronco adopted additional aerodynamic revisions. While designed with a larger grille, front bumper, and headlight units, the front fascia was given a slightly rounded design.

=== Model changes ===

The interior again saw updates to the dashboard and instrument panel, with the addition of leather front seats as an option for XLT and Eddie Bauer trims as well as optional remote keyless entry with an anti-theft alarm. Maroon and blue leather seats were offered from 1992 through the end of production. After having power windows and locks as an option throughout the 1980s, power mirrors were offered for the first time for 1992. For 1996, the Ford Bronco became the first Ford vehicle to incorporate turn signal lights into its side mirrors.

The fifth generation introduced additional changes related to safety. 4-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS) replaced rear-wheel ABS for 1993, with a driver-side airbag introduced for 1994. The redesign included a safety front crumple zone into the frame and a center-mounted brake light to the hardtop; the hardtop was now the mounting point of 3-point seatbelts for the rear passengers.

In the aftermath of the safety upgrades, the Bronco was no longer able to be marketed as a lift-off hardtop (from a legal standpoint). While still physically possible, the hardtop contained the upper mounts for the now required 3 point seatbelts and the required center brake light was mounted above the rear window on this hardtop (unlike Jeep mounting the 3rd brake light to the spare tire). To discourage owners from removing the hardtop, Ford removed all literature in the vehicle owner&#x27;s manual related to its removal. To further inhibit its removal, Ford secured the hardtop in place with #40 Security Torx bolts, instead of the standard bolts used on previous model years. Removal of the hardtop could lead to a traffic citation, for tampering with the center brake light and/or inoperable rear seatbelts, depending on local and state laws.

=== Powertrain ===
The fifth-generation Bronco carried over the previous 4.9L inline-6, 5.0L V8, and the 5.8L H.O. V8 engines from the previous generation. For 1994, the Bronco became powered solely by V8 engines, as the 4.9L inline-6 was withdrawn from the model line. For 1996, the two V8 powertrains became OBD-II compliant.

=== Special editions ===

The monochrome Nite edition was again available, though 1992 was its last offering. Monochrome paint versions were reintroduced from 1993 (1994 model) to 1996, as the XLT Sport variant of the Bronco available in black, red, or white. Another variant of the XLT was a two-tone light teal green and white (charcoal gray interior); approximately 600 were produced each year.

The Eddie Bauer outdoors-themed edition made its return, offered from 1992 to 1996. Again combining nearly every option for the Bronco with a trim-specific exterior and interior combination, the Bronco Eddie Bauer introduced an overhead console for 1994 along with lighted sun visors and an auto-dimming rearview mirror (both offered as option on the XLT). For 1995, the Eddie Bauer saw the addition of front bumper vents (added to the XLT for 1996).

=== Discontinuation ===

The last fifth-generation Bronco built rolled off the Wayne, Michigan assembly line on June 12, 1996. According to Ford, the discontinuation of the model line was unrelated to any stigma created from the then-recent O.J. Simpson police chase, as sales of the model line had been in decline previous to the incident. To better compete with the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban and the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon, Ford introduced the Ford Expedition for 1997 to replace the Bronco.

Following the lineage of the 1978–1996 Bronco, the Expedition was derived from the tenth-generation F-150, but shifted from a two-door body with a lift-off hardtop to a five-door wagon/SUV body, slotted above the Ranger-based Ford Explorer. 

=== Centurion Classic (1987–1996) ===

A four-door Ford competitor for the Chevrolet Tahoe was not released until the introduction of the Expedition for the 1997 model year (and the 2000 Excursion, competing against the ¾-ton version known as the Chevrolet Suburban 2500). As the Bronco was produced solely as a two-door wagon after 1972, all four-door Broncos were developed and produced on a license-built basis by the aftermarket.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Centurion Vehicles, a converter specializing in Ford trucks based in White Pigeon, Michigan, constructed the Centurion Classic, a four-door version of the fourth- and fifth-generation Bronco. In the construction of each Classic, Centurion would mate the cab of an F-Series crew-cab pickup (from the C-pillar forward) to body of a Bronco (from the B-pillar rearward), including the rear quarter panels, hardtop, and tailgate of the SUV. Early models used fiberglass rear body panels, but later, these were made from steel. As the body conversion retained the rear seat of the Bronco, a Centurion Classic was equipped with three-row seating for up to nine people.

Centurion Vehicles offered two models of the Classic: the C-150 (based on the Ford F-150 chassis, with optional four-wheel drive) and the C-350 (based on the F-350, four-wheel drive was standard). Both models used a 140-inch wheelbase (9 inches longer than the Suburban); as the F-150 was not produced as a crew cab, a C-150 was constructed from three different vehicles (crew cab, Bronco rear, and F-150 frame). In contrast to the ¾-ton Suburban 2500, the C-350 Classic utilized a one-ton chassis. The C-150 was offered with 5.0L and 5.8L V8 engines; the C-350 used the 7.3L diesel V8 and 7.5L gasoline V8 (the only Bronco variants to use these engines).

The Centurion Classic was offered until the end of Bronco production in 1996; though the Bronco was directly replaced by the Expedition, the C-150/C-350 is closest in size to the Ford Excursion introduced for the 2000 model year. As of current production, the C-350 is the only SUV produced on a one-ton chassis (the 2000–2005 Ford Excursion was produced on a ¾-ton chassis).

=== O.J. Simpson chase ===

The Ford Bronco gained notoriety on June 17, 1994, when Al Cowlings drove his white 1993 Bronco XLT with his accused friend O.J. Simpson in the back seat, in a low-speed police chase on Interstate 405, ending in his eventual surrender. The incident was simulcast on television worldwide, with approximately 95 million North Americans watching live.

== Sixth generation (U725; 2021) ==
Ford released its sixth generation Bronco for the 2021 model year, after a 25-year hiatus of the Bronco nameplate. Styling recalls many elements from the 1966–1977 series, and the design chief&#x27;s 1976 Bronco was digitally scanned as a reference during the design process. Conceived as a direct competitor to the Jeep Wrangler, the Bronco is offered in a two and four door SUV, each reconfigurable as a convertible. Moreover, just like on a Wrangler, the doors can easily be removed, but unlike the Jeep&#x27;s, the Bronco&#x27;s doors are frameless, and with the door-glass wound down, the doors can be carried in dedicated covers, &quot;within&quot; the vehicle, while riding door-less. A &quot;Bronco&quot; and a &quot;bucking horse&quot; emblem on the tailgate and steering wheel replace the Ford Blue Oval. The Bronco is now a mid-size SUV, bringing its chassis and powertrain closer in size to the Ford Ranger.

=== Background ===
The potential revival of the Bronco came up in 2016 negotiations between Ford and the UAW. At the time, it was discussed that Michigan Assembly would cancel production of the fourth-generation Ford Focus and the C-Max, which would move to Mexico. The UAW ultimately announced the factory would remain open, to be retooled for the revival of the Ford Ranger in North America and the Ford Bronco. The Bronco was developed as Ford expected the Ranger would not be enough to fill factory capacity, and needed a second model to be built alongside it.

While Ford did not share future product plans with the UAW, the company confirmed the return of the Bronco at the 2017 North American International Auto Show. Packaged as a direct competitor to the Jeep Wrangler, Ford announced two and four-door variants. Intended for a 2021 model year release, the sixth generation would be based on the Ford Ranger, retaining body-on-frame construction. In contrast to the Ford Everest sold overseas, the Bronco would receive a distinct body recalling the first generation with further off-road capability.

Ford showed a pre-production prototype to a group of dealers in March 2019. On November 1, 2019, an announcement was made for a spring 2020 reveal, intended for the 2021 model year. Originally scheduled for a March 2020 unveiling, the Bronco was unveiled on July 13, 2020, following multiple delays, mostly in relation to the global COVID-19 pandemic; Ford unintentionally scheduled the unveiling for July 9 (the date of O.J. Simpson&#x27;s birthday). On March 27, 2021, at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auto Auction, the first production Bronco, a First Edition, sold for $1,075,000 (~$ in ) with all the funds going to a charity Ford helped establish to help preserve forests.

When the reveal officially premiered, Ford accepted $100 (~$ in ) reservations, with production scheduled for 2021.

The first production units rolled off the assembly line, on Monday, June 14, 2021 at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, the production facility of the previous five generations.

The take rate for the seven-speed manual transmission was reported to be around 15% for the initial orders.

=== Specifications ===

The standard engine is a 2.3-liter turbocharged &quot;EcoBoost&quot; inline-four that makes and of torque. A 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged &quot;EcoBoost&quot; V6 is optional; the larger variant makes and of torque. The 2.7-liter V6 is only available with a 10-speed automatic transmission while the 2.3-liter can be mated with either the 10-speed automatic or a standard 7-speed Getrag manual. Despite the nomenclature, the Getrag transmission is not a true seven-speed transmission, instead being a traditional six-speed unit with a dedicated crawler gear (the &quot;C&quot; on the shift knob) as the &quot;seventh gear&quot;.

Recalling the original Bronco Roadster, removable doors with frameless glass combined with a detachable roof allow open-air driving on both two- and four-door models, and boast ground clearance. Doors can be user-removed and stored in the rear cargo area, and the mirrors are attached to the body cowl instead of on the doors, allowing the user to remove the doors and still have the mirrors attached to the vehicle. The leading edge of the front fenders feature raised black brackets, called trail sights, to facilitate navigation and serve as tie-downs and accessory mounts.

The body-on-frame construction uses front twin A-arm independent suspension and a rear five-link coilover suspension and a solid axle. The optional HOSS (High-Performance Off-Road Stability Suspension) setup replaces these with position-sensitive Bilstein shocks, with multiple compression and rebound zones, at all four corners. On some trims the front sway bar features a hydraulic disconnect to increase articulation when crawling, automatically reconnecting when brought back to speed. An option package, marketed as &quot;Sasquatch&quot;, includes a mild suspension lift, and 35-inch tires - the largest of any production vehicle besides the upcoming 3rd generation Ford Raptor, which has optional 37-inch tires.

Standard equipment includes Dana axles with front and rear electronic differentials, both user-lockable via dashboard switches. The drivetrain can toggle between 4WD Low, 4WD High, 4WD Automatic, and 2WD High (rear-wheel drive), controlled by a dial near the gear selector rather than a secondary shifter aside the main shift lever.

Optional equipment includes a terrain management system, marketed as &quot;G.O.A.T. Modes&quot; (Goes Over Any Type of Terrain). The system calibrates throttle response, four-wheel drive, traction control, and transmission shifts to maximize traction when offroading. Up to seven modes are available with this system: Normal, Eco, Sport, Slippery, and Sand, along with Baja, Mud and Ruts, and Rock Crawl. The available Trail One-Pedal Drive automatically applies and holds the brakes when the driver lifts off the gas pedal, removing the need for left-foot braking and preventing unexpected rollbacks. The sixth-generation Bronco also offers Trail Turn Assist, which utilizes the torque-vectoring system to help the vehicle turn in tight offroad corners.

An optional topographical map software, marketed as &quot;Trail Maps&quot;, allows owners to share smartphone-downloaded topo maps to the vehicle&#x27;s In-car entertainment system and record videos of trail runs, display telemetry or map data, and upload to the cloud. The sixth generation features a tray that slides from under the rear cargo compartment. An action mount on the front dash to allow for phone and camera mounting, waterproof switches and rubber floors are also available.

=== Bronco Raptor ===
Ford announced a Raptor trim level for 2022 in a 4-door version only. Developed by Ford Performance, the Bronco Raptor has a EcoBoost 3.0 TT V6 with a &quot;Baja Mode&quot;, making 418 hp and 440 lb-ft of torque. The vehicle will also have an upgraded cooling system, which would allow the Bronco Raptor to run better in higher temperatures.

The Bronco Raptor is also wider at and sits on a new Fox suspension with of ground clearance (1.6 inches (41 mm) more than the Bronco with the Sasquatch package). Many other components in the Bronco Raptor have been upgraded or added such as stronger axles, more rigid cross bars, a dual exhaust with several different exhaust modes, 37 inch tires, a higher strength frame, reinforced front bumper, larger drive shafts for increased wheel torque, better brakes (from the F-150 Raptor), Ford nameplate grill (unlike Bronco on other trims), and a tow/haul mode. The Bronco Raptor is capable of towing which is more than the standard Bronco. Due to the Bronco Raptor&#x27;s width, there is additional government-mandated lighting. The interior of the Bronco Raptor is also different from other trims. Unique &quot;code orange&quot; accents and stitching, additional bolstering to the seats with Raptor embroidered stitching, carbon fiber trim, a thicker steering wheel, magnesium paddle shifters, a leather stitched dashboard, and a larger center touchscreen.

=== Trim levels ===
The Bronco is available in several trim levels:

* The entry-level trim of the Bronco is known as the Base. Available as either a two-door or a four-door model, the Base comes equipped with the 2.3-liter EcoBoost twin-scroll turbocharged inline four-cylinder (I4) gasoline engine mated to a seven-speed manual transmission, the SYNC 4 eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system with wired and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, a six-speaker audio system, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a 4G LTE wireless modem, cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, sixteen-inch silver-painted steel wheels with 30&quot; tires, and keyless entry.

The Raptor is the second of three vehicles to join the Raptor lineup, following the Ford F-150 Raptor, and will also be followed by an all-new Ford Ranger Raptor model.
* The First Edition model, based on the equipment of the Badlands trim and available as either a two-door or a four-door model, was also available for the 2021 model year. Production was initially limited to only 7,000 units, although Ford later increased the amount of First Edition Broncos it would build due to increased demand.

=== China ===
The Chinese market Bronco went on sale in January 2024. Produced by Jiangling Ford Auto, the Bronco received upgraded interior materials and quality to meet Chinese customers expectations. It is solely powered by the 2.3-liter Ecoboost turbocharged gasoline engine, and only the 4-door version is available. The infotainment system is also unique to the Chinese market with a Ford SYNC+ system that supports over-the-air software update, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 high-computing chip, 16 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal storage.

=== 1966 Bronco Dune Duster ===
For the 1965 Detroit Auto Show Ford constructed a special Bronco roadster. According to Ford,

&quot;A special, customized version of Ford Division&#x27;s 1966 Bronco, the Dune Duster, will be displayed at the Detroit Auto Show from November 27 through December 5. The utility/sports-type vehicle was designed in Ford&#x27;s Styling Center in Dearborn and built by Parris Kustom in North Hollywood, California. Exterior paint is a specially formulated Golden Saddle Pearl and modifications include an NHRA-approved roll bar with integral headrests, a windshield designed to complement the contour of the roll bar, walnut appliques on the rear side panels and exposed chrome exhaust pipes. Custom interior appointments include a walnut steering wheel and front bucket seats with russet suede bolsters and perforated leather cushions and seatbacks. The instrument panel is trimmed with suede padding and outfitted with walnut-trimmed control knobs. Jump seats have been added to the rear compartment over the wheels and a tonneau cover for rear compartment protection was added for attachment with quick-fastening snaps.&quot;

=== 1970 Bronco Wildflower ===
For 1970, Ford re-dressed the Dune Duster as the Wildflower:

&quot;The Wildflower, a specially customized version of Ford Division&#x27;s popular four-wheel-drive Bronco, is sure to be one of the most colorful show cars on display at automobile shows this year. The unique vehicle, planned in Ford&#x27;s Design Center in Dearborn, Mich., was extensively modified, inside and out, to achieve a lively carefree appearance with added luxury and safety features. The dominant exterior characteristic of the Wildflower is the lively multi-colored paint treatment. The psychedelic design of blues, yellows and reds is topped off by a pink grille.&quot;

=== 1973 Big Bronco prototypes ===
In 1973, Ford Advanced Light Truck Engineering developed four future Ford Bronco prototypes. To better match the market success of the Chevrolet Blazer, Ford required its designers to shift from a dedicated chassis used by the model line to a shortened F-100 as the basis for a future Bronco. Dubbed &quot;Project Shorthorn&quot;, the prototype was constructed using the top and tailgate from a Chevrolet K5 Blazer, mating it to a shortened-wheelbase F-100. While the use of Chevrolet components was used purely for proof of concept, further development by Ford adopted a half-cab design (one design objective was the use of F-Series doors, along with a removable top).

Project Shorthorn was among four prototypes, alongside Longhorn (a four-door wagon-style SUV, similar to the Chevrolet Suburban), Midhorn (sized between the Jeep Wagoneer and International Travelall; a precursor to the Chevrolet Tahoe), and the Widehorn (a wide-body F-100 4x4, a precursor to the Ford Raptor).

As the development of Project Shorthorn happened during the OPEC oil crisis, the model program was postponed to the 1978 model year as Ford sought a more promising outcome. While the Longhorn/Midhorn four-door wagons saw a positive response, they were ultimately shelved, as the Project Shorthorn was introduced for only a two-year production (before a full redesign). Ford would not produce a production four-door SUV until the 1991 Ford Explorer (smaller than the Midhorn) and the 1997 Ford Expedition (between the Midhorn and Longhorn in size).

=== 1981 Bronco Montana Lobo ===
Built on a 1977 Bronco chassis, it included &quot;a pair of expansive Plexiglas bubble doors that were removable and that had a vague resemblance to the expanse of clear plastic that passed for four-weather doors on the Dune Duster. It included a rollbar that – though likely not NHRA certified and though integrated with side louvers and lights – still had a rough airfoil shape like the Dune Duster&#x27;s. It included side pipes like the Dune Duster&#x27;s. It included fold-up bench seats for bed seating like the Dune Duster&#x27;s In addition, the Montana Lobo included foam bumpers, a winch integrated into the front bumper, a retractable loading ramp built into the tailgate, storage compartments integrated into the bed sides, a T-top roof, and a massive tinted window between the cab and the bed that slid open.&quot;

=== 1988 Bronco DM-1 ===
Built on a Ford Escort platform, the DM-1 concept was a &quot;4-wheel drive concept vehicle was the winning design in a Ford sponsored contest for industrial art students. Mr. Derek Millsap, who created the 5-seat sport-utility vehicle, lent his initials to the Bronco DM-1 name. The bulbous body was made of steel-reinforced fiberglass, and the large hatch extended into the roof.&quot;

=== 1992 Boss Bronco ===
The Boss Bronco concept was a restyled Bronco made for a &quot;new generation of light truck buyers&quot;, with a modern design and car-like features. It went on display at various auto shows in 1992. The Boss Bronco featured an all-new, modern front end, and a retractable fastback roof. The exterior was painted &quot;lone star&quot; yellow, while the interior trim had a blue/black leather finish. 

=== 2001 U260 ===
In 1999, a new Bronco was secretly developed under Moray Callum, as a simple inexpensive off-roader in the spirit of the first generation Bronco, rather than the later full-size models. Planned as a 2-door and 4-door, it was codenamed U260, U meaning utility, 2 meaning 2-door, and 60 referring to the Ford Ranger&#x27;s T6 platform it would have used. Land Rover underpinnings were considered but was deemed too costly. The project did not progress to a drivable state and was canceled in 2001 due to company cutbacks stemming from the Firestone and Ford tire incident. The project was publicly revealed for the first time in the leadup to the sixth gen Bronco&#x27;s release, with a full-size research model displayed at the 2021 Concours d’Elegance Of America.

=== 2004 Bronco Concept ===

At the 2004 North American International Auto Show, a Ford Bronco concept vehicle was unveiled. Inspired by the first-generation (1966–1977) Ford Bronco, the 2004 concept adapted a short wheelbase, round headlamps, and squared-off roofline; the concept marked one of the first uses of a three-bar grille on Ford vehicles. Using a minimalist exterior design, the Bronco design was unveiled alongside a Shelby Cobra Concept at the same show.

Using the Ford CD2 platform of the Ford Escape, the Bronco concept was powered by a 2.0L four-cylinder turbodiesel (from the Ford Mondeo) and a six-speed manual transmission. Replacing ControlTrac II, an &quot;Intelligent&quot; 4-wheel drive system was intended for improved stability and fuel economy.

A new production Bronco was attempted in 2006, adapting the Bronco concept&#x27;s design over the International Ford Ranger&#x27;s chassis. It was to be exported to the US from South Africa, where it would have been built alongside the Ranger in Pretoria. It was canceled as it was seen as a risk due to rising gas prices, slowing SUV sales and weakening economy ahead of the Great Recession.

Dwayne Johnson&#x27;s character drives the Bronco concept in his 2018 film, &quot;Rampage&quot;.

=== 2013 Expedition &quot;special edition” concept ===
Ford marketer Mark Grueber spoke of a Ford Expedition show build concept that wore an intentionally nondescript rear Bronco badge, solely to prevent expiration of the Bronco trademark. It is unclear which concept he is referring to.

=== 2020 Bronco R Prototype ===
At the 2019 Baja 1000, Ford introduced the Ford Bronco R prototype with the drivetrain of the new as-yet unreleased 2021 Bronco with the intent of testing the engine, transmission and four-wheel-drive system to be used in the production-spec sixth-generation Bronco. The Baja 1000 was thought to be the perfect test for the new off-road vehicle Ford is producing, with 1000 miles of some of the world&#x27;s roughest terrain. The 2020 race was also tougher after being delayed for 24 hours due to excessive rainfall in the days before the event. With the excessive rainfall, one of the Class One co-drivers Ford used in the race referred to it as the &quot;Mud Bog 1000&quot;.While the Bronco R prototype model used for the Baja 1000 shared some components with the production Bronco, Ford upfitted the Bronco R with off-road-tuned racing suspension as well as off-road wheels and 37-inch off-road tires. The Bronco R also used a 70-gallon fuel tank during the race, allowing the prototype to travel up to 315 miles of the course before refueling. While this would have been a significant advantage to the Bronco R team, it was not taken advantage of. The Bronco R team made a stop every 130 miles to swap drivers, as well as checking the vehicle&#x27;s condition and making sure there were no repairs needed at the time.

Ford did not disclose details of the engine used in the Bronco R. The only information that is known was that the engine was a twin-turbo EcoBoost engine. When it came to the four-wheel drive system, the vehicle experienced no issues with muddy sections of the course. While the drivers only had to use four-wheel drive with low gearing to get out of thick mud, the Bronco R stopped multiple times along the course to tug other competitors out of the mud, including a near 6,000 pound trophy truck. While the Bronco R&#x27;s engine, transmission and four-wheel drive held up with no issues, many of the aftermarket suspension components did not fare the same. Around mile 495 of the 1000 mile journey, the passenger side spindle, lower-control arm and CV joint had been destroyed. The team was able to fix most issues and were able to continue the race until around mile 580, when the engine cooling fans began giving out (one fan had completely seized up, while the other was not working at max speed) causing the Bronco R to overheat and needing to be towed about eight miles to the next filling station. After about 30 minutes of working on the Bronco R to try to get it back on course, Ford pulled the vehicle out of the race due to severe mechanical issues.

<doc id="1307398" wikidata="Q4752942" url="?curid=1307398" title="Ancient and Primitive Rite">
<text>The Ancient and Primitive Rite, also called the &quot;Order of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Mizraim&quot;, is a Masonic Rite first popularized by John Yarker. It has been considered irregular by Masonic organisations such as the United Grand Lodge of England since at least 1860.

==History==
John Yarker&#x27;s Ancient and Primitive Rite grew out of the Rite of Memphis-Misraim, which itself was a combination, formed in 1881, of the &quot;Rite of Memphis&quot; and the &quot;Rite of Misraïm&quot;, both of which appeared in France at the beginning of the 19th century.

Yarker had been introduced to the &quot;Rite of Memphis&quot; in 1871 during a visit to New York. As well as establishing the Ancient and Primitive Rite, Yarker would later become Deputy International Grand Master (1900) and International Grand Master (1902) of the Rite of Memphis-Misraim. He formed the Ancient and Primitive Rite with 33 degrees by eliminating duplicative degrees from the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm.

Yarker&#x27;s Rite claimed a history going to Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s armies in Egypt, and traced the development of the Rite until his present day. He professed also that &quot;Its Rituals embrace all Masonry, and are based on those of the Craft universal; they explain its symbols, develope [sic] its mystic philosophy, exemplify its morality, examine its legends, tracing them to their primitive source, and dealing fairly and truthfully with the historical features of Symbolical Masonry. They contain nothing in their teaching but what Mahommedan, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, Brahmin, or Parsee may alike acknowledge.&quot; Until Yarker&#x27;s death in 1913, there was never more than a total of 300 members.

<text>HMS &quot;Ravager&quot; (D70) was an built in the United States (as part of the ) and operated by the Royal Navy during World War II.

&quot;Ravager&quot; was initially constructed in the U.S. by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding in Tacoma, in 1942. She was purchased by the U.S. Navy and was converted to an escort carrier at Commercial Iron Works, Portland, Oregon. Upon completion in 1943 she was transferred to the Royal Navy and named HMS &quot;Ravager&quot;.

The ship initially served as a convoy escort in the Atlantic theatre. Later in the war she was used mainly as a deck-landing training carrier. In February 1946 she was returned to the US Navy and sold for civilian use in July 1947, being renamed Robin Trent and later Trent. She was scrapped in 1973.

==Construction==
&quot;Ravager&quot; (AVG-24) was laid down as MC hull 240 on 11 April 1942, by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Tacoma, Washington. She was intended to be named &quot;Charger&quot;, but was named &quot;Ravager&quot; when launched 16 July 1942; sponsored by Mrs. C. G. Mitchell; acquired by the U.S. Navy and transferred to the United Kingdom under lend-lease on 25 April 1943; and commissioned in the Royal Navy the same day.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft, two boilers and a steam turbine giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two /50, /38 or 5 in/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen Bofors 40 mm Automatic Gun L/60 anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==Service history==

During World War II, &quot;Ravager&quot;, redesignated on U.S. Navy records as CVE-24 on 15 July 1943, operated in the Atlantic protecting Allied shipping from German U-boats. After the war ended, she arrived Norfolk, 9 February 1946, and was returned to the U.S. Navy there on 27 February, the day she was decommissioned by the Royal Navy. &quot;Ravager&quot; was sold to William B. St. John, of New York City, 1 July 1947, and was placed in merchant service as &quot;Robin Trent&quot;.

<text>Illegal Art is a sampling record label that was started in 1998. The label gained immediate notoriety from legal threats surrounding &quot;Deconstructing Beck&quot;, a compilation made exclusively from sampling Beck&#x27;s music. This was followed by two other theme-based compilations, &quot;Extracted Celluloid&quot; and &quot;Commercial Ad Hoc&quot;. All three were co-released with Negativland&#x27;s Seeland Records label and sponsored by RTMark. After these theme-based compilations, Illegal Art focused on artist releases. One of the most popular artists on the label is Girl Talk (Gregg Gillis), who in 2006 released his third album, &quot;Night Ripper&quot;, to critical acclaim on the label, earning a &quot;Wired&quot; magazine Rave Award a year later.

Illegal Art also released the &quot;Steinski Retrospective&quot;, spanning his work from 1983 to 2006. It includes the legendary &quot;Lessons&quot;, which have been described as &quot;one of the most desirable and prized bootleg recordings in hip hop&quot; (Antidote). It also contains a variety of other essential tracks, and his critically acclaimed &quot;Nothing to Fear: A Rough Mix&quot;, an hour-long mashup that was produced for Solid Steel/BBC London and hailed as &quot;the closest to a masterpiece the genre has produced.&quot;

As of 2024, Illegal Art&#x27;s website states that the label has been on an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; since 2012.

<doc id="1307420" wikidata="Q964998" url="?curid=1307420" title="Al Matthews (actor)">
<text>Alexander Basil Matthews (November 21, 1942 – September 22, 2018), commonly known as Al Matthews, was an American actor, singer, and radio personality. He was best known for his appearance as Gunnery sergeant Apone in the 1986 film &quot;Aliens&quot;.

==Early life and military career==
Matthews was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 21, 1942. He was a member of the United States Marine Corps who graduated at Parris Island on May 25, 1966, and served during the Vietnam War. On his website, he stated:I spent six years in the United States Marine Corps; I hold thirteen combat awards and decorations, including two purple hearts. I was the first black Marine in the 1st Marine Division in Vietnam to be meritoriously promoted to the rank of sergeant; I served with Kilo Battery, Fourth Battalion, 11th Marines, 1st Marine Division, of that I am very proud.

==Acting and musical career==
===Music===
Similar to US supply sergeant Chuck Bennett who was stationed in Germany, sang soul music and had a couple of chart hits as well as acted, Matthews was stationed away from his home and he had an earlier career in music.

In 1975, he scored a musical hit in the UK Singles Chart, &quot;Fool&quot;, which reached number 16 in the fall of that year. One of the session singers on the record was Maxine Nightingale who had appeared in the German production of &quot;Hair&quot; in the early 1970s. Pierre Tubbs who produced Matthews&#x27; hit was impressed with Nightingale and he asked Nightingale&#x27;s &quot;Hair&quot; co-star, J. Vincent Edwards to co-write a song with him which turned out to be “Right Back Where We Started From”.

In August 1976, Al Matthews &amp; the Last Word were appearing at the Clouds in Brixton, The Pavilion in Bath and the BLue Lagaoon in Newquay.

In 1977, he recorded the single &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;. Backed with &quot;Stormy Days and Lonely Nights&quot; it was released on Mercury 6007 152.

In 1978, he released the single &quot;People Are People&quot; / &quot;Run to You&quot;.

At some stage, Alan Mair played bass in the Al Matthews Band.

===Film===
Matthews played various acting roles, such as Ferguson in &quot;Rough Cut&quot; (1980), a workman in &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot; (1981), a Vietnam veteran in &quot;The Sender&quot; (1982), a fire chief in &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), Benedict in &quot;The American Way&quot; (1986), Sergeant Apone in &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), General Tudor in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997) and Master Sergeant #3 in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997). He also worked in British television, appearing in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; as Sam Green, the father of Benny Green, as well as in theater and radio; for the latter, as both an actor (on BBC Radio 4) and a presenter (on BBC Radio 1 and Capital Radio).

He reprised his &quot;Aliens&quot; role 27 years later, providing the voice of Apone for the video game &quot;&quot; (2013).

==Death==
On September 22, 2018, Matthews was found unresponsive by a neighbor in his Orihuela, Spain, home. Matthews had retired there in 2005 after working in the United Kingdom. He was later pronounced dead at age 75. Local reports claim he had battled severe illnesses over the years.

== In popular culture ==
Matthews&#x27; portrayal of Sgt. Apone was the inspiration for Sgt. Avery Johnson of the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise.

<text>Pensnett is a village of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, West Midlands County, England, south-west of Dudley. Pensnett has been a part of Dudley since 1966, when the Brierley Hill Urban District, of which it was a part, was absorbed into the County Borough of Dudley, later the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley from 1974.

==Pensnett Chase==

The present Pensnett covers a small portion of what was a large common called Pensnett Chase in Kingswinford parish, but contiguous with Dudley Wood in Dudley. As such, it belonged to the lords of the manor, descending as part of the Dudley estate from medieval times. With Dudley Wood, it is probably the woodland mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to those manors. There is a rifle range on the chase at barrow bank which was being used for practice firing by volunteer regiments from at least 1860 through till 1920 with many Martini–Henry bullets being found by local metal detectorists.

The name Pensnett is from the Celtic &#x27;pen&#x27;, for hill and the Anglo-Saxon for &#x27;a piece of woodland&#x27;. For many years, it was used as commonland, for animal grazing and a hunting reserve of the lords of Dudley. Pensnett Chase was inclosed under the Pensnett Chase Inclosure Act 1784 (24 Geo. 3. Sess. 2. c. &quot;18&quot; ). This reserved mining rights to the lord of the manor, but included a clause to compensate people for mining subsidence. The mining of coal and ironstone was long established, and probably goes back to medieval times.

==History of Pensnett==
The present settlement of Pensnett dates only from the period after the inclosure of Pensnett Chase. Pensnett was made part of the parish of St Mark&#x27;s, Pensnett in 1844. Towards the end of the 19th century the area began a period of dramatic change. Several factories were built in Pensnett and the factory workers were mostly employed in the iron and steel industries. Many terraced houses with shop fronts were developed along the village&#x27;s High Street around the start of the 20th century, but the biggest changes were yet to come.

After World War I, Brierley Hill Urban District Council followed the example of almost every local authority in Britain and built houses which were to be rented to working-class families. Several hundred council houses were built in the Pensnett area between 1920 and 1966, although a large percentage of the village&#x27;s homes were privately owned.

==Location==

Pensnett lies in the Brierley Hill DY5 postal district. As it is close to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre, built during the 1980s, the roads around Pensnett are often congested. As long ago as the early 1990s, there were plans to build a relief road around Pensnett, but nothing has yet come of them.

==Trading estate==

The Pensnett Trading Estate has gradually expanded since about 1970. It was mostly developed in the 1980s. It includes many industrial and commercial businesses, and since 2000 has included a National Express West Midlands bus depot which replaced a depot in the Merry Hill Shopping centre.

Pensnett Halt railway station closed in 1932 and the freight sidings closed in 1994 although some sections of track remain buried in the undergrowth.

==Education==
The nearest primary school is Bromley Pensnett Primary School, situated just around the corner from the site of Pensnett High School.

The local secondary school was Pensnett High School in Tiled House Lane which was previously known as Pensnett School of Technology and Pensnett Secondary Modern School, having opened in 1932. The school changed from Pensnett School of Technology to Pensnett High School in 2007. However, after much speculation about its future, it was scheduled for a phased closure beginning in July 2011, with the 12- and 13-year-old pupils transferring to new schools in September that year, and no 11-year-olds being admitted. However, the school&#x27;s oldest two year groups remained at the school to complete their studies before it finally closed completely in July 2013. Most children living in the Pensnett area now attend Crestwood School in Kingswinford or Holly Hall Academy in Dudley.

The local authority&#x27;s Learning Support centre was situated on Birds Meadow from 1978 until 1989, within the buildings of the former Birds Meadow Infant School which dated back to the 1930s. The site was redeveloped for private housing in the early 1990s.

==Barrow Hill Local Nature Reserve==
Barrow Hill Local Nature Reserve is situated in Pensnett, near St Mark&#x27;s Church. The hill in the reserve is formed by an extinct volcano, which erupted around 315 million years ago.

<text>Dosage is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock rock band Collective Soul. The album was released on Atlantic Records in February 1999 and peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart. The album&#x27;s title was derived from a catchphrase they used to describe burnout after their previous tour.

The first single from the album, &quot;Heavy&quot;, gave the band another number-one hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and spent a then record-breaking 15 weeks on the top spot. &quot;Heavy&quot; was also featured in the opening of the video game &quot;NHL 2001&quot; and in the 2014 Golden Corral ad. The second single released, &quot;Run&quot;, also gained broad mainstream radioplay and was featured on the soundtrack for the 1999 film &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;.

Over nine years after the album&#x27;s release, the single &quot;Tremble for My Beloved&quot; was featured in the 2008 film &quot;Twilight&quot; and its accompanying soundtrack.

In 2012, the band performed the album in its entirety (save &quot;Dandy Life&quot;) during their Dosage Tour.

==Recording==
&quot;Dosage&quot; marked a change in recording and style for Collective Soul. Unhappy with the production and sound of the previous album &quot;Disciplined Breakdown&quot;, the band focused more on production and technique for the recording of &quot;Dosage&quot;. The result led to an arduous six-month recording period where according to guitarist Dean Roland: &quot;The way we recorded &quot;Dosage&quot;, we were really meticulous about everything that we did for that record.&quot; More than before, the band progressed to a high production pop-rock sound. This status was obvious with the extensive use of loops, Pro Tools effects, and synth-pop sounds, especially in comparison with the band&#x27;s previous three albums, which are more organic and raw in sound.
Ed Roland also said, &quot;Anthony brought an unbelievable spirit and attitude. He has more gadgets than we do so we all had a good time just plugging stuff in and seeing what sounds would work.&quot; Dean Roland said of working with Anthony J. Resta, &quot;We started working with Anthony in 1999 or 1998 when we recorded &quot;Dosage&quot; and we just met him through another friend of ours. And initially, he just came in to help us with some programming ideas and drum arrangements, he&#x27;s an amazing drummer and he&#x27;s got that natural rhythmic thing going on. So he came in there and helped us with some of those things and that relationship just grew into other things you know like ultimately co-producing and co-writing with us. He&#x27;s just a great soul, a great spirit to have around when you&#x27;re working and creating&quot;.

Guitarist Ross Childress wrote two songs that were considered for &quot;Dosage&quot;, &quot;Dandy Life&quot; and the unreleased song &quot;Tell&quot;. Ed Roland gave Childress the option to include one of the two songs for the album, so Childress picked &quot;Dandy Life&quot;, which featured him on lead vocals.

<doc id="1307448" wikidata="Q5694245" url="?curid=1307448" title="Heatherton Village">
<text>Heatherton Village (or Heatherton) is a residential area of Derby, England, located at the southern end of the village of Littleover, and approximately south west of Derby city centre. It comprises a range of modern housing, several public parks, shops, churches, a school and a nursery.

==History==
During its development in the 1990s the area was initially referred to as &quot;Hollybrook&quot;. This was after one of two brooks flowing through the area, the other being the Hell Brook. The former goes through the grounds of the Holly Brook pub before flowing into the latter which comes from Mickleover past Littleover Community School.

The area is situated off the A5250, three miles south-west of the Derby city centre, with easy access to Burton and Birmingham via the A38 and to the M1 via the A50.

The majority of the Heatherton development is highly sought-after property, and has been popular among professional footballers. During Derby County F.C.&#x27;s first stint in the Premiership from 1996 to 2002, Heatherton was home to Fabrizio Ravanelli. Other players who have lived there include Christian Dailly, Giles Barnes and Mart Poom.

==Education==
Griffe Field Primary School lies within the estate on Grosvenor Drive, built as a part of the initial development by Birch plc (since acquired by Edinburgh-based Miller Homes) but since expanded to double its original size early in the 2000s.

==Community facilities==
There is a small shopping arcade on Hollybrook Way, at the south-western entrance to the estate, across the road from the Haven Church, the Hollybrook pub and a doctor&#x27;s surgery. An Aldi supermarket was opened on a greenfield site adjacent to the Hollybrook pub in 2022.

Since the late 1990s, Heatherton has been served by a bus route operated by Trent Barton, known as &quot;The Harlequin&quot;. It circles the estate and runs to a terminus on Gower Street in Derby&#x27;s city centre during daytime from Monday to Saturday.

<doc id="1307467" wikidata="Q609139" url="?curid=1307467" title="Shenmue II">
<text>Shenmue II is a 2001 action-adventure game developed by Sega AM2 and directed by Yu Suzuki. It was published by Sega in Japan and Europe for the Dreamcast in 2001, while an enhanced version was published by Microsoft Game Studios in Western markets for the Xbox in 2002.

Like the original &quot;Shenmue&quot; (1999), &quot;Shenmue II&quot; consists of open-world environments, brawler battles and quick-time events. It features a day-and-night system, variable weather effects, non-player characters with daily schedules, and various minigames. The player controls the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki as he arrives in Hong Kong in 1987 in pursuit of his father&#x27;s killer. His journey takes him to Kowloon and the mountains of Guilin, where he meets a girl who is part of his destiny.

Some of &quot;Shenmue II&quot; was developed alongside the original &quot;Shenmue&quot;, which was the most expensive video game ever developed at the time. The Dreamcast version was not released in North America, where Microsoft secured console exclusivity for the Xbox. &quot;Shenmue II&quot; received acclaim for its story and scale and has appeared in several lists of the greatest games of all time. Reviews of the Xbox version were less positive, with critics finding its graphics lacking compared to other Xbox games.

&quot;Shenmue II&quot; sold poorly and further games in the series entered a period of development hell lasting over a decade. In December 2006, &quot;Shenmue II&quot; was released on Xbox Live marketplace for the Xbox 360. In 2018, Sega released high-definition ports of &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot; for Windows, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. &quot;Shenmue III&quot;, developed by Suzuki&#x27;s company Ys Net, was released in 2019 following a successful crowdfunding campaign.

==Gameplay==

Like the original &quot;Shenmue&quot;, the player controls the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki in his journey for revenge. Most of the game is spent exploring the open world, searching for clues, examining objects and talking to non-player characters for information. The game features a 3D fighting system similar to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series; Ryo can fight multiple opponents at once and practice moves to increase their power. In quick-time events, the player must press the right combination of buttons at the right moment to succeed.

&quot;Shenmue II&quot; adds several features. Players can ask for directions from passersby, and fast-forward the game clock when waiting for a scheduled event to occur, such as a shop opening or character arriving. Unlike the first &quot;Shenmue&quot;, taking a job is not part of the main story, and the player can choose how to earn money—for example, by gambling, arm wrestling, street fighting or running a pachinko stand. Ryo can spend money on items such as capsule toys or 1980s arcade games including &quot;Hang-On&quot;, &quot;After Burner,&quot; &quot;Space Harrier&quot; and &quot;Out Run&quot;. The Dreamcast version allows the player to import their save data from the first &quot;Shenmue&quot;, transferring money, items and martial arts moves.

== Plot ==
In 1987, the teenage martial artist Ryo Hazuki arrives from Japan in Wan Chai, Hong Kong, on the trail of his father&#x27;s killer, Lan Di, of the criminal Chi You Men organization. He searches for Master Lishao Tao, the only link to the whereabouts of Yuanda Zhu, a martial arts expert who sent Ryo&#x27;s father a letter warning him of Lan Di&#x27;s intentions. When Ryo finds Tao, whose real name is Xiuying Hong, she refuses to help, considering his quest for vengeance reckless. The two part ways, but Xiuying continues to monitor Ryo&#x27;s progress.

Ryo encounters Wuying Ren, the wily leader of a street gang. Ren decides to help Ryo after deciding there may be money to be made in Ryo&#x27;s mysterious phoenix mirror; Lan Di took the second mirror, the dragon mirror, when he killed Ryo&#x27;s father. Wong, a street boy who admires Ren, and Joy, a free-spirited motorcyclist, assist Ryo in his journey.

Ren informs Ryo that Zhu is hiding from the Chi You Men in Kowloon Walled City, a densely populated, crime-ridden enclave of Hong Kong. They locate Zhu there but are ambushed by the criminal Yellow Head organization and Zhu is kidnapped. Ryo and his allies infiltrate the Yellow Head headquarters, but Wong and Joy are captured. Ryo defeats a powerful martial artist and rescues Joy. On the rooftop of the Yellow Head building, Ryo rescues Wong and Zhu from the Yellow Head leader, Dou Niu, as Lan Di departs by helicopter.

At Ren&#x27;s hideout, Zhu reveals that Lan Di killed Ryo&#x27;s father because he believes Iwao killed his own father. He also reveals that the mirrors will lead to the resurrection of the Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China. Zhu advises Ryo to continue his search in Bailu Village in Guilin, where he says Lan Di is also heading.

In the mountains of Guilin, Ryo rescues a girl, Shenhua Ling, after she dives into a river to rescue a deer. Shenhua&#x27;s family is connected to the legacy of the mirrors, and she seems to have magical abilities. They walk through the mountains to her village. At Shenhua&#x27;s family home, a tree named Shenmue (Chinese for &quot;sedge tree&quot;) is in bloom; she explains that her name means &quot;flower of the Shenmue tree&quot;. The pair go to a stone quarry on the village outskirts to meet Shenhua&#x27;s father, but find he is missing. They discover a cryptic note and sword; Ryo combines the sword with the phoenix mirror, triggering a device that reveals a large mural of the dragon and phoenix mirrors.

== Development ==
&quot;Shenmue II&quot; was developed by Sega AM2 and directed by Yu Suzuki. Part of the game was developed in tandem with the first &quot;Shenmue&quot;, which was most expensive video game ever developed at the time and is reported to have cost Sega US$70 million; in 2011, Suzuki said the figure was closer to $47 million including marketing. According to &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Shenmue II&quot; was completed for &quot;a much more reasonable sum&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Shenmue II&quot; was published by Sega for Dreamcast in 2001 in Japan and Europe. The Japanese version included &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot; &quot;Passport&quot;, promoting Sega&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Virtua Fighter 4&quot;. By 2003, the Dreamcast version had sold 100,000 copies, a tenth of the original game&#x27;s sales.

The Dreamcast version was not released in North America, where Microsoft Game Studios secured console exclusivity rights for &quot;Shenmue II&quot; on Xbox in October 2001. The Xbox version was published by Microsoft on October 29, 2002. It features an additional camera mode, optional filter effects, improved frame rate and lighting, and English-language voice acting. It also contains a DVD of &quot;Shenmue: The Movie&quot;, a compilation film comprising cutscenes from the original &quot;Shenmue&quot; that was released in Japanese theaters. An of the first two &quot;Shenmue&quot; games premiered on February 6, 2022.

Sega released remastered versions of &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue II&quot; games for Windows, Xbox One, and the PlayStation 4 on 21 August 2018. The remaster include updated graphics and control options, improved user interfaces and Japanese and English voices.

==Reception==

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Shenmue II&quot; received positive reviews. &quot;GameSpot&quot; found that it greatly improved on &quot;Shenmue&quot; and refined &quot;nearly every aspect&quot;, with an &quot;epic feel&quot;. Tom Bramwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; felt it was an effective swan song for the Dreamcast, which it took to &quot;the very brink of its capabilities&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; felt that, like the first game, &quot;Shenmue II&quot; had some uninteresting elements, but praised the expanded scale and action.

Reviews of the Xbox version were less positive. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the story and soundtrack, but criticized the English-language voice acting and found the graphics lacking compared to other Xbox games. Matt Keller of &quot;palgn.com&quot; also criticized the English-language voice acting but concluded: &quot;&quot;Shenmue II&quot; is a great example of the fusion of two different genres, and it provides an excellent, engrossing narrative to compliment the excellent gameplay.&quot; &quot;Eurogamer&quot; Martin Taylor criticized the port as &quot;lazy&quot;, and concluded: &quot;Your perseverance with the sluggish pacing can be rewarding, but &quot;Shenmue II&quot; consistently proves itself an ageing game with ageing looks.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Shenmue II&quot; is an extremely satisfying yarn that breaks into new visual and gameplay territory. The Xbox needed a game like this.&quot; It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Story on Xbox&quot; award, but lost to &quot;Dead to Rights&quot;.

&quot;Shenmue II&quot; was voted the tenth-best game of all time by &quot;IGN&quot; readers in 2008. In 2013, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; named &quot;Shenmue&quot; and &quot;Shenmue&quot; &quot;II&quot; the best Dreamcast games, and in 2014 &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;Shenmue II&quot; the 51st-best game of all time.

==Sequel==

After the commercial failure of the first two games, &quot;Shenmue III&quot; entered a period of development hell lasting over a decade. In September 2011, Suzuki left Sega to focus on his development studio, Ys Net. In June 2015, he launched a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to develop &quot;Shenmue III&quot; with Ys Net for the PlayStation 4 and Windows, having licensed the rights from Sega. It was released in November 2019.

<text>Barjik (died 731) was a Khazar prince who flourished in the early 8th century. He is described by al-Tabari as &quot;the son of the Khagan&quot;; his exact status and position is unknown though he may have been the Bek.

Barjik led the Khazar armies in the Khazar-Arab wars of the early 8th century. In 730, he won a victory at the Battle of Marj Ardabil, sacking and occupying the city. He killed the Arab general al-Jarrah al-Hakami and mounted the latter&#x27;s head on his throne as a trophy. This enraged the Umayyad troops who faced him the following year outside of Mosul, and Barjik was defeated and slain in the ensuing battle.

<doc id="1307478" wikidata="Q67987" url="?curid=1307478" title="Albrecht von Graefe (ophthalmologist)">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Albrecht von Gräfe, often Anglicized to Graefe (22 May 182820 July 1870), was a Prussian pioneer of German ophthalmology. Graefe was born in Finkenheerd, Brandenburg, the son of Karl Ferdinand von Graefe (1787–1840). He was the father of the far right politician Albrecht von Graefe (1868–1933).

== Background ==
At the University of Berlin, Graefe studied philosophy, logic, natural sciences and anatomy, under notable names such as Dove, H. Rose, Müller, and Schlemm, eventually obtaining his medical doctorate in 1847. He continued his studies at Prague, Paris, Vienna and London, and having devoted special attention to ophthalmology, in 1850, he began to practice as an oculist in Berlin. Here, he founded a private institution for the treatment of eyes. During the same year, he received his habilitation with the thesis &quot;Über die Wirkung der Augenmuskeln&quot;.

In 1858 he became an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Charité in Berlin, where in 1866 he was appointed a full professor. In 1870, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 1862 he married Anna Knuth. The couple had three children, two of whom died in infancy.

Graefe died in Berlin from pulmonary tuberculosis on 20 July 1870. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. II of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.
== Contributions ==

Graefe made many contributions to ophthalmological science, being considered one of the more important (if not the most important) figures in 19th century ophthalmology. Among his achievements were a method of treating glaucoma and a new operation for cataract.

He introduced iridectomy for glaucoma, identified retardation of the eyelid in Basedow&#x27;s disease, and described the combination of retinitis pigmentosa and perceptive deafness in Usher&#x27;s syndrome. Also, he provided early descriptions of optic neuritis (1860), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (1868). and papilledema (involving four patients with brain tumor and a swelling of the optic disc). In addition, he is credited with design of a specialized knife, the &quot;Von Graefe knife&quot;, for cataract surgery. This knife was used till the 1960s. The eponymous &quot;Gräfe&#x27;s sign&quot; is associated with Graves-Basedow disease.

In 1855 he founded the &quot;Archiv für Ophthalmologie&quot;, in which Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812–1887) and Franciscus Donders (1818–1889) collaborated. In 1863 he founded the Deutsche Ophtalmologische Gesellschaft.

<text>The &quot;Aylwin&quot; class was a class of four destroyers in the United States Navy; all served as convoy escorts during World War I. The &quot;Aylwin&quot;s were the second of five &quot;second-generation&quot; 1000-ton four-stack destroyer classes that were front-line ships of the Navy until the 1920s. They were known as &quot;thousand tonners&quot;. All were scrapped in 1935 to comply with the London Naval Treaty.

All four ships were built by William Cramp &amp; Sons in Philadelphia.

These ships were built concurrently with the and in some references are considered to be in that class. In design and armament they were essentially repeats of the &quot;Cassin&quot; class.

==Design==
Unlike the other &quot;thousand tonner&quot; classes, the &quot;Aylwin&quot;s were not a significant improvement on the previous class.

===Armament===
They retained the &quot;Cassin&quot;s&#x27; armament of four /50 caliber Mark 9 guns and eight 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in twin broadside mounts. Compared with the previous of the &quot;flivver&quot; type, the increased gun armament reflected the increasing size of foreign destroyers they might have to fight. The broadside (two twin mounts each side) torpedo armament reflected the General Board&#x27;s desire to have some torpedoes remaining after firing a broadside. The class was probably equipped with one or two depth charge racks each for anti-submarine convoy escort missions in World War I. &quot;Benham&quot; was equipped with four twin 4-inch mounts in 1917, but these were replaced with single mounts before she deployed overseas. By 1929 all except &quot;Parker&quot; had a /23 caliber anti-aircraft gun added.

===Engineering===
The ships were equipped with four White-Forster boilers supplying steam to two Cramp direct-drive steam turbines driving two shafts for as designed; all of the class exceeded this on trials. Compound steam engines could be clutched to the shafts for economical medium-speed cruising. &quot;Aylwin&quot; achieved on trials at ; this was typical for the others of the class. Normal fuel oil capacity was 307 tons.

<text>Çankırı, historically known as Gangra (Greek: Γάγγρα), is a city in Turkey, about northeast of Ankara. It is situated about 800 m (2500 ft) above sea level. It is the seat of Çankırı Province and of Çankırı District. Its population is 90,564 (2021).

== History ==

Çankırı was known in antiquity as Gangra (), and later Germanicopolis (). The city has also been known as Changra, Kandari, Kanghari, or Kangri.
Α town of Paphlagonia that appears to have been once the capital of Paphlagonia and a princely residence, for it is known from Strabo that Deiotarus Philadelphus (before 31 BC–5/6 AD), the last king of Paphlagonia, resided there. Notwithstanding this, Strabo describes it as only &quot;a small town and a garrison&quot;.

According to 1st-century BC writer Alexander the Polyhistor the town was built by a goat herder who had found one of his goats straying there; but this origin is probably a mere philological speculation as &quot;gangra&quot; signifies &quot;a goat&quot; in the Paphlagonian language.
Gangra was absorbed into the Roman province of Galatia upon the death of Deiotarus in 6/5 BC. The earlier town was built on the hill behind the modern city, on which are the ruins of a late fortress, while the Roman city occupied the site of the modern city.
In the writings of the 2nd-century AD Greco-Roman writer Ptolemy, the city is referred to as Germanicopolis (Greek: ). It was named Germanicopolis, after Germanicus or possibly the emperor Claudius, until the time of Caracalla.
In Christian times, Gangra was the metropolitan see of Paphlagonia. Hypatios, bishop of Gangra, is considered a saint in the Orthodox Christian tradition. He was killed by Arians on his return from the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), in which he took part.

In the 4th century, the town was the scene of an important ecclesiastical synod, the Synod of Gangra. There is disagreement about the date of the synod, with dates varying from AD 341 to 376. The synodal letter states that twenty-one bishops assembled to take action concerning Eustathius of Sebaste and his followers. The synod issued twenty canons known as the Canons of Gangra; these were declared ecumenical by the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Under these canons, the sect disowned marriage, disparaged the offices of the church, held conventicles of their own, wore a peculiar dress, denounced riches, and affected special sanctity. The synod condemned the Eustathian practices, declaring however that it was not virginity that was condemned, but the dishonouring of marriage; not poverty, but the disparagement of honest and benevolent wealth; not asceticism, but spiritual pride; not individual piety, but dishonouring the house of God.

Over the centuries the settlement witnessed the hegemony of many cultures and races, such as Hittites, Persians, ancient Greeks, Parthians, Pontic Greeks, Galatians, Romans, Byzantine Greeks, up to the Seljuks and finally the Ottoman Turks. Traces from its long past are still visible throughout the city.

<text>François Marius Granet (17 December 1775 – 21 November 1849) was a French painter.

==Biography==
François Marius Granet was born on 17 December 1775 in Aix-en-Provence; his father was a small builder. As a boy his strong desires led his parents to place him, after some preliminary teaching from a passing Italian artist, in a free school of art directed by M. Constantin, a landscape painter of some reputation. In 1793, Granet followed the volunteers of Aix to the siege of Toulon, where he obtained employment as a decorator in the arsenal.

Whilst a lad he had, at Aix, made the acquaintance of the young comte de Forbin, and upon his invitation Granet, in the year 1797, went to Paris. De Forbin was one of the pupils of David, and Granet entered the same studio. Later he got possession of a cell in the convent of Capuchins, which, having served for a manufactory of &quot;assignats&quot; during the Revolution, was afterwards inhabited almost exclusively by artists. In the changing lights and shadows of the corridors of the Capuchins, Granet found the materials for that one picture to the painting of which, with varying success, he devoted his life.

In 1802, he left Paris for Rome, where he remained until 1819, when he returned to Paris, bringing with him besides various other works one of fourteen repetitions of his celebrated &quot;Chœur des Capucins,&quot; executed in 1811. The figures of the monks celebrating mass are taken in this subject as a substantive part of the architectural effect, and this is the case with all Granet&#x27;s works, even with those in which the figure subject would seem to assert its importance, and its historical or romantic interest. &quot;Stella painting a Madonna on his Prison Wall,&quot; 1810 (Leuchtenberg collection); &quot;Sodoma à l&#x27;hôpital,&quot; 1815 (Louvre); &quot;Basilique basse de St François d&#x27;Assise,&quot; 1823 (Louvre); &quot;Rachat de prisonniers,&quot; 1831 (Louvre); &quot;Mort de Poussin,&quot; 1834 (Villa Demidoff, Florence), are among his principal works; all are marked by the same peculiarities, everything is sacrificed to tone.

In 1819, Louis Philippe decorated Granet, and afterwards named him Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre St Michel, and Conservateur des tableaux de Versailles (1826). He became a member of the institute in 1830; but in spite of these honours, and the ties which bound him to M. de Forbin, then director of the Louvre, Granet constantly returned to Rome. In 1821, he presented his painting &#x27;Interior view of the choir in the Church of the Capuchin monastery in the Piazza Barberini in Rome&#x27; to Alexander I of Russia. In 1834, Granet was elected an honorary associate of the Imperial Academy of Arts.

After 1848, he retired to Aix, immediately lost his wife, and died himself on 21 November 1849. He bequeathed the greater part of his fortune to his native town and all his collections (including the very fine portrait by Ingres from 1811 ) to the Museum of Aix en Provence, which was renamed the &quot;Musée Granet&quot; in 1949, the centenary of his death.

==Gallery==
==Memorial==
A museum in the centre of Aix-en-Provence is named after him, the &quot;Musée Granet&quot;. It was built in 1838, and holds eight paintings by Paul Cézanne.

<text>Jason Emanuel Gould (; born December 29, 1966) is an American actor and singer.

== Early life ==
Gould was born on December 29, 1966, in New York City, the only child of singer and actress Barbra Streisand and actor Elliott Gould. His parents separated in 1969 and divorced July 9, 1971. He is Jewish.

== Career ==
Gould appeared as Mike Cameron in the romantic comedy-drama film &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989) and the romantic drama film &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1991) (which was directed by and starred his mother) but has seldom appeared in front of the camera since then.

In 1997, he made his West End theatre début in the drama play &quot;The Twilight of the Golds&quot; at the Arts Theatre in London; he played the part of David Gold, a theatre-designer.

Gould wrote, produced, and directed the short comedy film &quot;Inside Out&quot; (1997), playing Aaron in the story of the child of two celebrities who is outed by the tabloids. His father Elliott Gould played his father in the short film, and his half-brother Sam Gould played his brother. The short was later combined with other features for the compilation film &quot;Boys Life 3&quot; (2000).

Gould has since focused on a singing career. He released the 2012 EP &quot;Jason Gould&quot;, with the single &quot;Morning Prayer/Groove&quot; the following year. Gould performed with his mother during her 2012 North American and 2013 European Barbra Live tour. The two recorded &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean?&quot; for her 2014 album &quot;Partners&quot;. Gould released the album &quot;Dangerous Man&quot; in 2017.

== Personal life ==
At the age of 21, Gould came out to his parents as gay. By 1991, he was outed by tabloids. In an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot; published on August 17, 1999, Streisand said:

<doc id="1307551" wikidata="Q375525" url="?curid=1307551" title="Kyle Korver">
<text>Kyle Elliot Korver (born March 17, 1981) is an American professional basketball executive and former player who is the assistant general manager for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Creighton Bluejays. He is regarded as one of the greatest three-point shooters of all-time.

Korver was drafted in the second round of the 2003 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. He was immediately traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. After four and a half seasons in Philadelphia, he was traded to the Utah Jazz. During his first stint with the Jazz in 2009–10, Korver shot 53.6 percent from three-point range, which set an NBA single-season three-point field goal accuracy record. In 2010, he joined the Chicago Bulls. In 2012, he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, where in 2015 he was named an NBA All-Star. In 2017, he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he was a member of back-to-back Finals teams. In 2018, he was traded back to the Jazz. In 2019, he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks.

Korver ranks among the most prolific 3-point shooters in NBA history, ranking eighth all-time in 3-point field goals made and tenth all-time in 3-point field goal percentage. He is the only player to lead the NBA in three-point shooting percentage four times. Korver holds the Hawks and Jazz single-season three-point field goal percentage records and depending on the source/minimum threshold he is the Hawks career three-point percentage record-holder. He holds the NBA record for the highest three-point percentage (.536) in a season.

==Early life==
Korver was born in Paramount, California, and is the oldest of four children of Kevin Korver, a pastor for the Third Reformed Church in Pella, Iowa, and Laine Korver. Both of his parents played basketball at Central College in Pella. His grandfather, Harold Korver, is also a pastor at the Emmanuel Reformed Church in Paramount, California. He grew up in the Los Angeles area and was a Los Angeles Lakers fan as a child. Watching Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the Showtime Lakers instilled a love of basketball in Korver that made him want to pursue it himself. He moved to Iowa in 1993 when his father accepted his current pastoral position and graduated from Pella High School. In 2018, he and his three brothers were still in the top 10 in both career scoring and rebounding at Pella High.

==College career==
As a freshman at Creighton in 1999–2000, Korver was named to the MVC&#x27;s All-Bench team, All-Freshman team, and All-Newcomer team while averaging 8.8 points per game. He came off the bench in all but one game, hitting 43.4 percent of his three-pointers and 89.5 percent at the free-throw line.

As a sophomore in 2000–01, Korver earned second-team All-MVC honors while leading the league champion Jays with 14.6 points per game. He made a then-record 100 three-pointers while ranking 12th nationally with 45.2 percent accuracy from downtown. He was also named to the MVC All-Tournament team.

As a junior in 2001–02, Korver led Creighton in scoring (15.1), rebounding (5.5), assists (3.3) and steals (1.6) while earning MVC Player of the Year and honorable-mention All-America honors. He ranked 12th nationally in free throw percentage (89.0) and 41st in three-point percentage (42.9) while leading the Jays to MVC regular-season and Tournament titles.

As a senior in 2002–03, Korver became one of six players to repeat as MVC Player of the Year, joining Larry Bird, Hersey Hawkins, Xavier McDaniel, Lewis Lloyd, and Junior Bridgeman. He was a consensus All-American, including second-team honors from the Associated Press, ESPN.com, and the USBWA. Korver earned MVC tournament MVP honors for the second year in a row. In 34 games as a senior, he averaged 17.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals in 31.8 minutes per game.

Korver finished his career at Creighton fourth all-time in scoring (1,801), first in three-pointers made (371), first in three-point attempts (819), first in three-point accuracy (45.3), first in free throw accuracy (89.1), eighth in assists (294), ninth in blocked shots (58) and fourth in steals (172). His 371 career made three-pointers is an MVC record and tied for sixth most in NCAA history. Korver also holds Creighton single-season records for three-pointers made (129), three-point percentage (.480), and free-throw percentage (.908).

Korver graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in visual communications. He returned to Creighton in May 2019 to deliver the keynote at the university&#x27;s graduation ceremony.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia 76ers (2003–2007)===

On June 26, 2003, Korver was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the 51st overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft. The Nets, fresh off an Atlantic Division win and an appearance in the NBA Finals, were low on cash and had none of their preferred draft choices remaining on the board. The organization selected Korver and immediately sold his draft rights to the 76ers for $125,000. The $125,000 reportedly covered the Nets&#x27; summer league costs and a new copy machine, with the &quot;traded for a copy machine&quot; incident becoming a rallying cry for Korver for the rest of his career. In 2019, Korver used the experience to help motivate that year&#x27;s graduating class at his alma mater, Creighton University, explaining, &quot;a few years ago, the copy machine broke...and I&#x27;m still playing.&quot;

As a rookie in 2003–04, he averaged 4.5 points and 1.5 rebounds in 74 games. On December 21, 2003, he scored a season-high 18 points against the Boston Celtics.

In 2004–05, Korver appeared in 82 games (57 starts), and averaged 11.5 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.2 assists. He set the Sixers record for three-pointers made (226) and attempted (558). He led the league in three-pointers made, and ranked among NBA leaders in attempts (third) and percentage (18th, .405). On November 26, 2004, he scored a season-high 26 points against the Washington Wizards.

On August 2, 2005, Korver re-signed with the 76ers to a six-year, $25 million contract. On February 24, 2006, he scored a career-high 31 points in a 116–111 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. In 82 games (43 starts) in 2005–06, he averaged 11.5 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.0 assists in 31.3 minutes. He shot .430 from the field and .849 from the free-throw line and ranked fifth in the league in three-pointers made and 11th in three-point percentage.

In his last full year in Philadelphia in 2006–07, Korver appeared in 74 games (one start) and averaged a career-high 14.4 points. He led the NBA in free throw percentage and ranked ninth in three-point shooting. On February 21, 2007, he made six 3-pointers and matched a career high with 31 points to lead the 76ers to a 104–84 victory over the New York Knicks.

===Utah Jazz (2007–2010)===

On December 29, 2007, Korver was traded to the Utah Jazz in exchange for Gordan Giriček and a future first-round draft pick. On February 6, 2008, he scored a season-high 27 points against the Denver Nuggets.

In 2008–09, Korver appeared in 78 games (two starts) and averaged 9.0 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 1.8 assists. On March 14, 2009, he scored a season-high 25 points against the Miami Heat.

On October 28, 2009, Korver underwent surgery to remove a bone spur in his left knee. He subsequently missed the first 23 games of the 2009–10 season. On March 31, 2010, he scored a season-high 21 points against the Golden State Warriors. In 52 games, he averaged 7.2 points and 2.1 rebounds. He led the NBA in three-point shooting at .536 (59–110 3FGM), setting the NBA single season three-point shooting record, edging the record percentage of .524 that Steve Kerr set in 1994–95. His spot-on shooting surged after he finally returned fully healthy after the All-Star break, having struggled with wrist and knee issues following surgeries to both over the previous year.

===Chicago Bulls (2010–2012)===

On July 13, 2010, Korver signed with the Chicago Bulls. On November 24, 2010, he scored a season-high 24 points against the Phoenix Suns. In 2010–11, Korver, for the third time in his career, appeared in all 82 regular-season games (all coming off the bench), and averaged 8.3 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in 20.1 minutes. After finishing as the first seed in the East with a 62–20 record, the Bulls advanced through to the Eastern Conference finals, where they were defeated in five games by the Miami Heat. 

Korver appeared in 65 games (seven starts) with the Bulls in 2011–12, averaging 8.1 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 1.7 assists in 22.6 minutes. On March 10, 2012, he scored a season-high 26 points in a 111–97 win over the Utah Jazz. He hit 6 of 11 3-pointers and had seven rebounds and six assists.

===Atlanta Hawks (2012–2017)===
====2012–13 season====
On July 16, 2012, Korver was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for cash considerations. In 2012–13, he averaged 10.9 points in 30.5 minutes per game, while recording percentages of .461 FG%, .457 3FG%, and .859 FT%. He finished second in the NBA in three-point percentage and fourth in three-point field goals made with 189. He made at least one three-pointer in his final 73 games of the season, the longest active streak in the NBA at the time, a career-best and the fourth longest streak in league history (Dana Barros 89, Michael Adams 79, Dennis Scott 78). In addition, his 189 made threes was the fourth-best single season total in franchise history.

====2013–14 season====
On July 12, 2013, Korver re-signed with the Hawks to a four-year, $24 million contract. On December 6, 2013, Korver passed the NBA record for most consecutive games with a made three-pointer (90) originally set by Dana Barros (89). The streak eventually ended at 127 games on March 5, 2014. Korver finished the 2013–14 season with a 47.2 percent three-point shooting percentage which led the NBA. It broke Tyronn Lue&#x27;s (45.7%) franchise single-season three-point percentage (47.2%) record.

====2014–15 season: All-Star selection====
On December 15, 2014, Korver passed Jason Richardson for 15th all-time in three-pointers made. Five days later, in the Hawks&#x27; 104–97 win over the Houston Rockets, Korver scored a game-high 22 points and made all four of his free-throw attempts. This gave him 49 consecutive made free-throws on the season to set a new Hawks franchise record. The streak ended at 50 in the Hawks&#x27; next game against the Dallas Mavericks. On February 10, 2015, Korver received his first NBA All-Star selection as a reserve for the Eastern Conference in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, replacing the injured Dwyane Wade. At 33 years and 11 months old, he became the fourth-oldest first-time All-Star. On March 11, in a loss to the Denver Nuggets, Korver passed Kobe Bryant for 12th on the all-time three-pointers made list. Four days later in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Korver left the game with a broken nose after taking an offensive foul from Ed Davis with 8:59 left in the first half. The injury ended a streak of 51 consecutive games with a three-pointer by Korver, who missed both of his shots from behind the arc. After missing three games with the injury, he returned to action on March 22 against the San Antonio Spurs with protective gear on his face to cover the nose. Despite having the mask on March 31, 2015, Korver made four straight long-range shots, including three 3-pointers, in a 65-second span against the Milwaukee Bucks. Korver led the league in three-point shooting percentage for a third time (the second year in a row) with a 49.2%, which still stands as an Atlanta Hawks single-season franchise record.

On April 29, 2015, Korver was named the recipient of the Joe Dumars Trophy for winning the 2014–15 NBA Sportsmanship Award. During the 2015 playoffs, Korver suffered a right ankle sprain playing against the Cleveland Cavaliers on May 22 in the Eastern Conference Finals. The following day, he was ruled out for the rest of the playoffs.

====2015–16 season====
On November 6, 2015, Korver scored 22 points, hitting all eight of his shots, including four from three-point range, as the Hawks won their sixth straight with a 121–115 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 26, in a win over the New York Knicks, Korver hit one three-pointer and passed Rashard Lewis for ninth place on the all-time list for three-pointers made. However, his late December shooting slump marked one of the worst shooting stretches of his career. In four games between December 23–29, Korver shot 5-of-33 from the field and a woeful 2-of-27 from three-point range. Korver continued to struggle with his shot in January, missing all six of his shots on January 31 against the Miami Heat, marking just the third time in his career that he went 0-of-6 or worse as a starter. Over 47 games to begin the season, his 42% field goal shooting was the worst it had been since the 2004–05 season, and his 37% three-point shooting was a career-low success rate.

====2016–17 season====
On December 16, 2016, Korver scored a season-high 19 points and hit a season-high six three-pointers in a 125–121 win over the Toronto Raptors. The win gave the Hawks a 13–13 record after 26 games; they began the season 9–2. He set a season high on December 30, scoring 22 points in 29 minutes off the bench in a 105–98 win over the Detroit Pistons. Depending on the source/minimum threshold, Korver left the Hawks as the franchise career three-point percentage all-time leader (.452). NBA.com shows him as the leader, but Sports Reference does not (Tony Snell, 62–109 56.9%).

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018)===

==== 2016–17 season: First Finals appearance ====

On January 7, 2017, Korver was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Mike Dunleavy, Mo Williams, cash considerations and a protected future first round draft pick. The trade would pair Korver with fellow 2003 draftee LeBron James. He made his debut for the Cavaliers three days later, recording two points and three rebounds in 17 minutes off the bench in a 100–92 loss to the Utah Jazz. Korver went 2-of-10 over his first two games for the Cavaliers, with both games resulting in losses. On January 13, he scored 18 points off the bench to help the Cavaliers defeat the Sacramento Kings 120–108. On February 1, he had his best game yet as a Cavalier, scoring 20 points off the bench on 8-of-11 from the field with four three-pointers in a 125–97 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, on February 8, Korver scored a season-high 29 points on 10-of-12 from the field and 8-of-9 from the three-point line in a 132–117 win over the Indiana Pacers. He subsequently passed Jason Kidd (1,988) for seventh on the all-time three-pointers made list. A week later, on February 15, also against the Pacers, Korver became the seventh player in NBA history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, joining Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Jason Terry, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, and Jamal Crawford. On April 4, 2017, he returned after missing 11 games with a sore left foot and scored 11 points in 12 minutes in a 122–102 win over the Orlando Magic. Korver helped the Cavaliers go 12–1 over the first three rounds of the playoffs to reach the 2017 NBA Finals. There they faced the Golden State Warriors and were defeated in five games.

==== 2017–18 season ====
On July 12, 2017, Korver re-signed with the Cavaliers. On November 13, 2017, he scored 19 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter to spark a huge comeback for the Cavaliers, lifting them to a 104–101 win over the New York Knicks after they outscored New York 43–25 in the fourth. On January 6, 2018, in a 131–127 win over the Orlando Magic, Korver tied Paul Pierce for fourth place on the career 3-pointers list with 2,143. Two days later, he hit four 3-pointers and had 19 points off the bench in a 127–99 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, passing Pierce for fourth place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time list in 3-pointers made with 2,147. On February 9, 2018, he scored a season-high 30 points in a 123–107 win over the Atlanta Hawks. He made 7 of 13 from 3-point range and finished two points from matching his career high of 32. It was his first 30-point game since February 21, 2007. Korver went 794 games between 30-point games, marking the longest stretch between 30-point games in NBA history. The Cavaliers returned to the NBA Finals in 2018, where they lost 4–0 to the Warriors.

==== 2018–19 season ====
On October 30, 2018, in a 136–114 win over the Atlanta Hawks, Korver reached 11,000 career points.

===Return to Utah (2018–2019)===
On November 29, 2018, Korver was traded to the Utah Jazz in exchange for Alec Burks and two future second-round draft picks. On January 12, 2019, against the Chicago Bulls, Korver passed Jason Terry (2,282) to move into fourth place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time 3-pointers list.

On July 6, 2019, the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Korver from the Jazz as part of a package for Mike Conley Jr. The following day Korver was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Jevon Carter in exchange for Josh Jackson, De&#x27;Anthony Melton, and a 2020 second-round pick. He was subsequently waived by the Suns.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2019–2020)===
On July 25, 2019, Korver signed a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Bucks.

On March 8, 2020, in a game where Korver saw increased minutes due to injuries, he scored a season-high 23 points, and tied a season-high five three-pointers made, in a 109–95 loss to the Denver Nuggets. On August 10, 2020, Korver scored 19 points and grabbed 4 rebounds in only 22 minutes of playing time in a 114–108 loss to the Toronto Raptors.

Korver&#x27;s final NBA game was played in Game 5 of the 2020 Eastern Conference Semifinals on September 8, 2020, in a 94–103 loss to the Miami Heat. In his final game, Korver played for 6 minutes and recorded 3 points. He did not sign with any team for 2020–21 season to spend more time with his family, despite not announcing his retirement.

==Coaching career==
In August 2021, Korver was hired by the Brooklyn Nets as a player development coach.

== Executive career ==
On July 20, 2022, Korver joined the Atlanta Hawks as the team&#x27;s director of player affairs and development. On January 16, 2023, the Atlanta Hawks named Korver their assistant general manager.

Korver founded the Kyle Korver Foundation, which contributes to many philanthropic causes. He held a coat drive while with the 76ers, where he collected and donated coats to children in need. Korver added a new line of clothing called Seer Outfitters connected to his foundation to help underprivileged children. In 2013, he started in October the &quot;Socktober Drive&quot; in which he collects socks to donate to homeless people in Atlanta. Korver has also participated in the NBA&#x27;s Basketball Without Borders outreach program in Africa, China, Brazil and India. Korver is a Christian.

In March 2018, Korver took a leave of absence from the Cavaliers following the death of his brother Kirk, who died just before he was about to receive a liver transplant after suffering an unknown illness that caused multiple organ failure.

<text>George Monro Grant (December 22, 1835 – May 10, 1902) was a Canadian church minister, writer, and political activist. He served as principal of Queen&#x27;s College, Kingston, Ontario, for 25 years, from 1877 until 1902.

==Early life, education==
Grant was born in Stellarton, Pictou County, Nova Scotia. He was educated at the Pictou Academy and the anti-burgher seminary in West River in Nova Scotia, and, from 1853 to 1860, in Scotland at the University of Glasgow, where he had a brilliant academic career. Having entered the ministry of the Church of Scotland in 1861, he returned to serve in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, before being called to the St Matthew&#x27;s congregation in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he was minister from 1863 to 1877.

==Support of Confederation, railway development==
He quickly gained a high reputation as a preacher and as an eloquent speaker on political subjects. In 1867, Nova Scotia was the province most strongly opposed to federal union. Grant threw the whole weight of his great influence in favour of Canadian confederation, and his oratory played an important part in securing the success of the movement. When the consolidation of the Dominion by means of railway construction was under discussion in 1872, Grant traveled across Canada, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, with the engineers, including lifelong friend, Sir Sandford Fleming, who surveyed the route of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Grant&#x27;s book &quot;Ocean to Ocean&quot; (1873) was one of the first things that opened the eyes of Canadians to the value of the immense heritage they enjoyed. He never lost an opportunity, whether in the pulpit or on the platform, of pressing on his listeners that the greatest future for Canada lay in unity with the rest of the British Empire; and his broad statesmanlike judgment made him an authority which politicians of all parties were glad to consult.

==Ecclesiastical leadership==
He was very involved with the 1875 Union of the four Presbyterian groups that become the Presbyterian Church in Canada; not all of his contemporaries in the Synod of the Presbyterian Church of the Maritime Provinces of British North America joined with him in this new group, that eventually elected him Moderator of their General Assembly in 1889.

==Principal of Queen&#x27;s University==

In 1877 Grant was appointed Principal of Queen&#x27;s College in Kingston, Ontario, by the Third General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.
Through Grant&#x27;s efforts and influence, Queen&#x27;s expanded from a small denominational college into a large and influential educational centre. He attracted to it an exceptionally able body of professors, whose influence in speculation and research was widely felt during the quarter of a century that he remained at its head. Grant&#x27;s great friend Sir Sandford Fleming served as chancellor of Queen&#x27;s for most of Grant&#x27;s tenure. Grant served as president of the Royal Society of Canada from 1890 to 1891.

In 1888 Grant visited Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The effect of this experience was to strengthen still further the imperialism which was the guiding principle of his political opinions. On the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, Grant was at first disposed to be hostile to the policy of British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and Joseph Chamberlain; but his eyes were soon opened to the real nature of President Paul Kruger&#x27;s government, and he enthusiastically welcomed and supported the national feeling which sent men from the outlying portions of the British Empire to assist in defeating the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. Grant did not live to see the conclusion of the war, his death occurring at Kingston, Ontario, on May 10, 1902.

==Legacy==
Late in 1901, while lying ill in Kingston General Hospital, Grant was visited by the Duke of Cornwall and York, the future King George V, who was touring Canada following the death of Queen Victoria earlier that year. The Prince appointed Grant Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in honour of his achievements. The medal of this British decoration, which went missing for many years, was rediscovered in 2008.

At the time of his death &quot;The Times&quot; observed &quot;that it is acknowledged on all hands that in him the Dominion has lost one of the ablest men that it has yet produced.&quot;

In 1872 Grant married Jessie Lawson, who was the granddaughter of the first president of the Bank of Nova Scotia, William Lawson. Among their descendants was their grandson, the philosopher George Parkin Grant; their great-grandson, Michael Ignatieff, served as leader of the Official Opposition during his term as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Grant Hall, a prominent clock tower and meeting hall at Queen&#x27;s, is named in his honour.

==Major works==
* &quot;Ocean to Ocean&quot; (1873)
* &quot;Advantages of Imperial Federation&quot; (1889)
* &quot;Our National Objects and Aims&quot; (1890)
* &quot;Religions of the World in Relation to Christianity&quot; (1894)
Grant also published several volumes of sermons and lectures.

<text>Atosiban, sold under the brand name Tractocile among others, is an inhibitor of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin. It is used as an intravenous medication as a labour repressant (tocolytic) to halt premature labor. It was developed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals in Sweden and first reported in the literature in 1985. Originally marketed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, it is licensed in proprietary and generic forms for the delay of imminent preterm birth in pregnant adult women.

The most commonly reported side effect is nausea.

== Medical uses ==
Atosiban is used to delay birth in adult women who are 24 to 33 weeks pregnant, when they show signs that they may give birth pre-term (prematurely). These signs include regular contractions lasting at least 30 seconds at a rate of at least four every 30 minutes, and dilation of the cervix (the neck of the womb) of 1 to 3 cm and an effacement (a measure of the thinness of the cervix) of 50% or more. In addition, the baby must have a normal heart rate.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Atosiban is a nonapeptide, desamino-oxytocin analogue, and a competitive vasopressin/oxytocin receptor antagonist (VOTra). Atosiban inhibits the oxytocin-mediated release of inositol trisphosphate from the myometrial cell membrane. As a result, reduced release of intracellular, stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myometrial cells and reduced influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space through voltage-gated channels occur. In addition, atosiban suppresses oxytocin-mediated release of PGE and PGF from the decidua.

In human preterm labour, atosiban, at the recommended dosage, antagonises uterine contractions and induces uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence.

== Other uses ==
=== Atosiban use after assisted reproduction ===
Atosiban is useful in improving the pregnancy outcome of &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in patients with repeated implantation failure. The pregnancy rate improved from zero to 43.7%.

First- and second-trimester bleeding was more prevalent in ART than in spontaneous pregnancies. From 2004 to 2010, 33 first-trimester pregnancies with vaginal bleeding after ART with evident uterine contractions, when using atosiban and/or ritodrine, no preterm delivery occurred before 30 weeks.

In a 2010 meta-analysis, nifedipine is superior to β2 adrenergic receptor agonists and magnesium sulfate for tocolysis in women with preterm labor (20–36 weeks), but it has been assigned to pregnancy category C by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so is not recommended before 20 weeks, or in the first trimester. A report from 2011 supports the use of atosiban, even at very early pregnancy, to decrease the frequency of uterine contractions to enhance success of pregnancy.

== Pharmacovigilance ==
Following the launch of atosiban in 2000, the calculated cumulative patient exposure to atosiban (January 2000 to December 2005) is estimated as 156,468 treatment cycles. To date, routine monitoring of drug safety has revealed no major safety issues.

== Regulatory affairs ==
Atosiban was approved in the European Union in January 2000 and launched in the European Union in April 2000. As of June 2007, atosiban was approved in 67 countries, excluding the United States and Japan. It was understood that Ferring did not expect to seek approval for atosiban in the US or Japan, focusing instead on development of new compounds for use in Spontaneous Preterm Labor (SPTL). The fact that atosiban only had a short duration before it was out of patent that the parent drug company decided not to pursue licensing in the US.

== Systematic reviews ==
In a systematic review of atosiban for tocolysis in preterm labour, six clinical studies — two compared atosiban to placebo and four atosiban to a β agonist — showed a significant increase in the proportion of women undelivered by 48 hours in women receiving atosiban compared to placebo. When compared with β agonists, atosiban increased the proportion of women undelivered by 48 hours and was safer compared to β agonists. Therefore, oxytocin antagonists appear to be effective and safe for tocolysis in preterm labour.

A 2014 systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration showed that while atosiban had fewer side effects than alternative drugs (such as ritodrine), other beta blockers, and calcium channel antagonists, it was no better than placebo in the major outcomes i.e. pregnancy prolongation or neonatal outcomes. The finding of an increase in infant deaths in one placebo-controlled trial warrants caution. Further research is recommended.

=== Clinical trials ===

==== Atosiban vs. nifedipine ====
A 2013 retrospective study comparing the efficacy and safety of atosiban and nifedipine in the suppression of preterm labour concluded that atosiban and nifedipine are effective in delaying delivery for seven days or more in women presenting with preterm labour. A total of 68.3% of women in the atosiban group remained undelivered at seven days or more, compared with 64.7% in the nifedipine group. They have the same efficacy and associated minor side effects. However, flushing, palpitation, and hypotension were significantly higher in the nifedipine group.

A 2012 clinical trial compared tocolytic efficacy and tolerability of atosiban with that of nifedipine. Forty-eight (68.6%) women allocated to atosiban and 39 (52%) to nifedipine did not deliver and did not require an alternate agent at 48 hours, respectively (p=.03). Atosiban has fewer failures within 48 hours. Nifedipine may be associated with a longer postponement of delivery.

A 2009 randomised controlled study demonstrated for the first time the direct effects of atosiban on fetal movement, heart rate, and blood flow. Tocolysis with either atosiban or nifedipine combined with betamethasone administration had no direct fetal adverse effects.

==== Atosiban vs. ritodrine ====
Multicentre, controlled trial of atosiban vs. ritodrine in 128 women shows a significantly better tocolytic efficacy after 7 days in the atosiban group than in the ritodrine group (60.3 versus 34.9%), but not at 48 hours (68.3 versus 58.7%). Maternal adverse events were reported less frequently in the atosiban group (7.9 vs 70.8%), resulting in fewer early drug terminations due to adverse events (0 versus 20%). Therefore, atosiban is superior to ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labour.

<doc id="1307572" wikidata="Q131016" url="?curid=1307572" title="Czech koruna">
<text>The koruna, or crown (sign: Kč; code: CZK, ), has been the currency of the Czech Republic since 1993. The koruna is one of the European Union&#x27;s eight currencies, and the Czech Republic is legally bound to adopt the euro in the future.

The official name in Czech is (plural , though the zero-suffixed genitive plural form is used on banknotes and coins of value 5 Kč or higher). The ISO 4217 code is CZK and the local acronym is Kč, which is placed after the numeric value (e.g., &quot;50 Kč&quot;) or sometimes before it (as is seen on the 10-koruna coin). One crown is made up of 100 &quot;hellers&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;h&quot;, official name in Czech: singular: , nominative plural: , genitive plural: – used with numbers higher or equal to 5 – e.g. ), but hellers have now been withdrawn from circulation, and the smallest unit of physical currency is 1 Kč.

==History==
In 1892, the Austro-Hungarian krone replaced the gulden at the rate of two kronen to one gulden (which is also the reason why the 10 Kč coin had been nicknamed or &quot;fiver&quot; - and has been in use in informal conversation up until nowadays). The name was suggested by the emperor, Franz Joseph I of Austria. After Austria-Hungary dissolved in 1918, Czechoslovakia was the only successor state to retain the name of its imperial-era currency. In the late 1920s, the Czechoslovak koruna was the hardest currency in Europe. During the Second World War, the currency on the occupied Czech territory was artificially weakened. The Czechoslovak crown was restored after the war. It underwent a highly controversial monetary reform in 1953.

The Czech koruna replaced the Czechoslovak koruna in 1993 after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. It first consisted of overstamped 20 Kčs, 50 Kčs, 100 Kčs, 500 Kčs, and 1,000 Kčs banknotes, and a new series was properly introduced in 1993.

In November 2013, the Czech National Bank (ČNB) intervened to weaken the exchange rate of the koruna through a monetary stimulus to stop the currency from excessive strengthening. This was meant to support the Czech economy, mainly focused on export, but people were unhappy about this step because it was set up before Christmas, which led to raising the prices of imported goods. In late 2016, the ČNB stated that the return to conventional monetary policy was planned for mid-2017. After higher-than-expected inflation and other figures, the national bank removed the cap at a special monetary meeting on April 6, 2017. The koruna avoided significant volatility and City Index Group stated: &quot;If you want to drop a currency peg, then the ČNB can show you how to do it&quot;.

==Euro adoption discussion==

The Czech Republic planned to adopt the euro in 2010, but its government suspended that plan indefinitely in 2005. Although the country is economically well positioned to adopt the euro, there is considerable opposition to the move within the Czech Republic. According to a survey conducted in April 2014, only 16% of the Czech population was in favour of replacing the koruna with the euro. As reported by an April 2018 survey by CVVM (Public Opinion Research Center), this value remained at nearly identical levels between 2014-18, with only 20% of the Czech population above 15 years old supporting euro adoption.

==Coins==

The coins of the Czech koruna increase in size and weight with value.

In 1993, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 haléřů (h), 1 Kč, 2 Kč, 5 Kč, 10 Kč, 20 Kč and 50 Kč. The 10 h and 20 h coins were taken out of circulation by 31 October 2003 and the 50 h coins by 31 August 2008 due to their diminishing purchasing power and circulation. However, financial amounts are still written with the accuracy of 1-haléř (CZK 0.01); prices in retail shops are usually multiples of CZK 0.10. When cash transactions are made, the amount is rounded to the nearest integer.

In 2000, the 10 Kč and 20 Kč coins were minted with different obverses to commemorate the millennium. In 1993 and 1994, coins were minted in Winnipeg and Hamburg, then in the Czech Republic. The 10 Kč and 50 Kč coins were designed by (1934–2007).

Since 1997, sets for collectors are also issued yearly with proof-quality coins. Also, a tradition exists of issuing commemorative coins – including silver and gold coins – for numismatic purposes.

For a complete listing, see Commemorative coins of the Czech Republic.

==Banknotes==
The first Czech banknotes were issued on 8 February 1993 and consisted of Czechoslovak notes with adhesive stamps affixed to them. Only the 100 Kčs, 500 Kčs and 1,000 Kčs notes were overstamped, the lower denominations circulated unchanged during this transitional period. Each stamp bears a Roman and Arabic numeral identifying the denomination of the banknote to which it is affixed (C and 100, D and 500, M and 1,000). Subsequent issues of the 1,000 Kč note replaced the adhesive stamp with a printed image of same.

A newly designed series of banknotes in denominations of 20 Kč, 50 Kč, 100 Kč, 200 Kč, 500 Kč, 1,000 Kč and 5,000 Kč were introduced later in 1993 and are still in use at present – except for 20 Kč, 50 Kč and the first versions of 1,000 Kč and 5,000 Kč notes, since the security features of 1,000 Kč and 5,000 Kč notes were upgraded in the subsequent issues (The 2,000 Kč note, which was introduced in 1996, is still valid in all versions, with and without the new security features). These banknotes, designed by Oldřich Kulhánek, feature renowned Czech persons on the obverse and abstract compositions on the reverse. Modern protective elements can be found on all banknotes.

In 2007, the Czech National Bank started issuing new upgraded banknotes with upgraded security features. These include a new colour-shifting security thread, additional watermarks and EURion constellations. The first denomination to be issued with the new features was the 2,000 Kč, followed by the 1,000 Kč in 2008, the 500 Kč and 5,000 Kč in 2009 and finally ending with the issuance of the 100 Kč and 200 Kč notes in 2018.

In practice, the 5000 Kč is not commonly found in circulation due to them being prone to misuse or illicit activity (e.g., money laundering). At the end of December 2023, there were 26 million of those banknotes in circulation. In contrast, the next-highest denomination, the 2000 Kč, is the most widely circulated banknote in the country, with almost 190 million in circulation.

<text>General Sir James Hope Grant, GCB (22 July 1808 – 7 March 1875) was a British Army officer. He served in the First Opium War, First Anglo-Sikh War, Indian Rebellion of 1857, and Second Opium War.

== Early life ==
Grant was the fifth and youngest son of Francis Grant of Kilgraston, Perthshire.

==Military career==
He entered the British Army in 1826 as cornet in the 9th Lancers, and became lieutenant in 1828 and captain in 1835. In 1842 he was brigade-major to Lord Saltoun in the First Opium War, and distinguished himself at the capture of Chinkiang, after which he received the rank of major and the CB. There is a popular, possibly apocryphal, story that he was selected by Saltoun (a keen violinist) because he wanted a cellist to accompany him and Hope Grant was the only officer he could find who played the cello. In the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1845–1846 he took part in the battle of Sobraon; and in the Punjab campaign of 1848–1849 he commanded the 9th Lancers, and won high reputation in the Battles of Chillianwalla and Gujarat.

He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel and shortly afterwards to the same substantive rank. In 1854 he became brevet-colonel, and in 1856 brigadier of cavalry. He took a leading part in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, holding for some time the command of the cavalry division, and afterwards of a movable column of horse and foot.

After rendering valuable service in the operations before Delhi and in the final assault on the city, he directed the victorious march of the cavalry and horse artillery dispatched in the direction of Cawnpore to open up communication with the commander-in-chief Sir Colin Campbell, whom he met near the Alambagh, and who raised him to the rank of brigadier-general, and placed the whole force under his command during what remained of the perilous march to Lucknow for the relief of the residency. After the retirement towards Cawnpore he greatly aided in effecting there the total rout of the rebel troops, by making a detour which threatened their rear; and following in pursuit with a flying column, he defeated them with the loss of nearly all their guns at Serai Ghat.

He also took part in the operations connected with the recapture of Lucknow, shortly after which he was promoted to the rank of major-general, and appointed to the command of the force employed for the final pacification of India. Before the work of pacification was quite completed he was created KCB. In 1859 he was appointed, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, to be Commander of British Troops in China and Hong Kong and to lead the British land forces in the Anglo-French expedition against China. The object of the campaign was accomplished within three months of the landing of the forces at Pei-tang (1 August 1860). The Taku Forts had been carried by assault, the Chinese defeated three times in the open and Peking occupied.

== Later life ==
For his conduct in this, which has been called the most successful and the best carried out of Britain&#x27;s &quot;little wars,&quot; he received the thanks of parliament and was gazetted GCB.

In 1861, he was made lieutenant-general and appointed commander-in-chief of the Madras Army; on this appointment he was automatically made a member of the Madras Legislative Council and held a seat from 1861 to 1864.

On his return to England in 1865 he was made Quartermaster-General to the Forces at headquarters; and in 1870 he was transferred to the command of Aldershot Division, where he took a leading part in the reform of the educational and training systems of the forces, which followed the Franco-German War. The introduction of annual army manoeuvres was largely due to Grant. In 1872 he was promoted to full general.

He died in London on 7 March 1875. He is buried in Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh.

<doc id="1307591" wikidata="Q545234" url="?curid=1307591" title="Tocolytic">
<text>Tocolytics (also called anti-contraction medications or labor suppressants) are medications used to suppress premature labor (from Greek τόκος &quot;tókos&quot;, &quot;childbirth&quot;, and λύσις &quot;lúsis&quot;, &quot;loosening&quot;). Preterm birth accounts for 70% of neonatal deaths. Therefore, tocolytic therapy is provided when delivery would result in premature birth, postponing delivery long enough for the administration of glucocorticoids (which accelerate fetal lung maturity) to be effective, as they may require one to two days to take effect.

Commonly used tocolytic medications include β2 agonists, calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, and magnesium sulfate. These can assist in delaying preterm delivery by suppressing uterine muscle contractions and their use is intended to reduce fetal morbidity and mortality associated with preterm birth. The suppression of contractions is often only partial and tocolytics can only be relied on to delay birth for a matter of days. Depending on the tocolytic used, the pregnant woman or fetus may require monitoring (e.g., blood pressure monitoring when nifedipine is used as it reduces blood pressure; cardiotocography to assess fetal well-being). In any case, the risk of preterm labor alone justifies hospitalization.

== Indications ==
Tocolytics are used in preterm labor, which refers to when a baby is born too early before 37 weeks of pregnancy. As preterm birth represents one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality, the goal is to prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality through delaying delivery and increasing gestational age by gaining more time for other management strategies like corticosteroids therapy that may help with fetus lung maturity. Tocolytics are considered for women with confirmed preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation age and used in conjunction with other therapies that may include corticosteroids administration, fetus neuroprotection, and safe transfer to facilities.

==Types of agents==
There is no clear first-line tocolytic agent. Current evidence suggests that first line treatment with β2 agonists, calcium channel blockers, or NSAIDs to prolong pregnancy for up to 48 hours is the best course of action to allow time for glucocorticoid administration.

Various types of agents are used, with varying success rates and side effects. Some medications are not specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in stopping uterine contractions in preterm labor, instead being used off-label.

According to a 2022 Cochrane review, the most effective tocolytics for delaying preterm birth by 48 hours, and 7 days were the nitric oxide donors, calcium channel blockers, oxytocin receptor antagonists and combinations of tocolytics.

Calcium-channel blockers (such as nifedipine) and oxytocin antagonists (such as atosiban) may delay delivery by 2 to 7 days, depending on how quickly the medication is administered. NSAIDs (such as indomethacin) and calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine) are the most likely to delay delivery for 48 hours, with the least amount of maternal and neonatal side effects. Otherwise, tocolysis is rarely successful beyond 24 to 48 hours because current medications do not alter the fundamentals of labor activation. However, postponing premature delivery by 48 hours appears sufficient to allow pregnant women to be transferred to a center specialized for management of preterm deliveries, and thus administer corticosteroids for the possibility to reduce neonatal organ immaturity.

The efficacy of β-adrenergic agonists, atosiban, and indomethacin is a decreased odds ratio (OR) of delivery within 24 hours of 0.54 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.91) and 0.47 within 48 hours (OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.30-0.75).

Antibiotics were thought to delay delivery, but no studies have shown any evidence that using antibiotics during preterm labor effectively delays delivery or reduces neonatal morbidity. Antibiotics are used in people with premature rupture of membranes, but this is not characterized as tocolysis.

==Contraindications to tocolytics==
In addition to drug-specific contraindications, several general factors may contraindicate delaying childbirth with the use of tocolytic medications.
* Fetus is older than 34 weeks gestation
* Fetus weighs less than 2.5 kg, or has intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or placental insufficiency
* Lethal congenital or chromosomal abnormalities
* Cervical dilation is greater than 4 centimeters
* Chorioamnionitis or intrauterine infection is present
* Pregnant woman has severe pregnancy-induced hypertension, severe eclampsia/preeclampsia, active vaginal bleeding, placental abruption, a cardiac disease, or another condition which indicates that the pregnancy should not continue.
* Maternal hemodynamic instability with bleeding
* Intrauterine fetal demise, lethal fetal anomaly, or non-reassuring fetal status

==Future direction of tocolytics==
Most tocolytics are currently being used off-label. The future direction of the development of tocolytics agents should be directed toward better efficacy in intentionally prolonging pregnancy. This will potentially result in less maternal, fetal, and neonatal adverse effects when delaying preterm childbirth. A few tocolytic alternatives worth pursuing include Barusiban, a last generation of oxytocin receptor antagonists, as well as COX-2 inhibitors. More studies on the use of multiple tocolytics must be directed to research overall health outcomes rather than solely pregnancy prolongation.

Aspect was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger, &quot;for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science&quot;.

==Education==

Aspect is a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS Cachan, today part of Paris-Saclay University). He passed the &quot;agrégation&quot; in physics in 1969 and received his PhD degree in 1971 from the École supérieure d&#x27;optique (later known as Institut d&#x27;Optique Graduate School) of Université d&#x27;Orsay (later known as Université Paris-Sud). He then taught for three years in Cameroon as a replacement for then compulsory military service.

In the early 1980s, while working on his doctorat d&#x27;État (habilitation thesis), he performed the Bell test experiments that showed that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen&#x27;s putative reductio ad absurdum of quantum mechanics, namely that it implied &#x27;ghostly action at a distance&#x27;, did in fact appear to be realized when two particles were separated by an arbitrarily large distance (see EPR paradox and Aspect&#x27;s experiment). A correlation between the particles&#x27; wave functions remains, as long as they were once part of the same undisturbed wave function before one of the child particles was measured. He defended his doctorat d&#x27;État in 1983 at Université Paris-Sud (today part of Paris-Saclay University).

Aspect received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2008.

==Research==
Aspect&#x27;s experiments, following the first experiment of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972, were considered to provide further support to the thesis that Bell&#x27;s inequalities are violated in its CHSH version, in particular by closing a form of the locality loophole. However, his results were not completely conclusive since there were loopholes that allowed for alternative explanations that comply with local realism.

After his work on Bell&#x27;s inequalities, Aspect turned toward studies of laser cooling of neutral atoms, and Bose–Einstein condensates at the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory.

Aspect was deputy director of the French &quot;grande école&quot; École supérieure d&#x27;optique until 1994. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and French Academy of Technologies, and a professor at the École Polytechnique.


==Distinctions==
Aspect was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2015. His certificate of election reads 

In 2005 he was awarded the gold medal of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, where he is Research Director. The 2010 Wolf Prize in physics was awarded to Aspect, Anton Zeilinger and John Clauser. In 2013 Aspect was awarded both the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal and the UNESCO Niels Bohr Medal. In 2011, he was assigned the Medal of the City of Paris. In 2013, he was also awarded the Balzan Prize for Quantum Information Processing and Communication. In 2014, he was named Officer of the Legion of Honour.

Asteroid 33163 Alainaspect, discovered by astronomers at Caussols in 1998, was named after him. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 ().

Aspect was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger &quot;for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell&#x27;s inequalities and pioneering quantum information science&quot;.

<doc id="1307603" wikidata="Q1384203" url="?curid=1307603" title="Hale Irwin">
<text>Hale S. Irwin (born June 3, 1945) is an American professional golfer. He was one of the world&#x27;s leading golfers from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. He is one of the few players in history to win three U.S. Opens, becoming the oldest ever U.S. Open champion in 1990 at the age of 45. As a senior golfer, Irwin ranks second all-time in PGA Tour Champions victories. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in Champions Tour history. He has also developed a career as a golf course architect.

==Early life==
Irwin was born in Joplin, Missouri, and raised in Baxter Springs, Kansas, and Boulder, Colorado. His father introduced him to the game of golf when he was four years old; he broke 70 for the first time at age fourteen. Irwin was a star athlete in football, baseball, and golf at Boulder High School and graduated in 1963.

== Amateur career ==
Irwin then attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, played football for the Buffaloes under head coach Eddie Crowder, was a two-time All-Big Eight defensive back (1965, 1966), and academic All-American. He won the individual NCAA championship in golf in his senior year in 1967.

==Professional career==
In 1968, Irwin turned professional. Irwin&#x27;s first PGA Tour victory was at the 1971 Sea Pines Heritage Classic.

Irwin&#x27;s first U.S. Open triumph came at Winged Foot in 1974 at the age of 29. In what became known as &quot;The Massacre at Winged Foot&quot;, Irwin won with a score of 7-over par, the second-highest winning score in relation to par of any U.S. Open since 1945. The course conditions at Winged Foot in 1974 were described as &quot;brutal&quot;. Johnny Miller and several other players suggested that the USGA had intentionally made the Winged Foot course setup particularly treacherous in response to Miller&#x27;s record-breaking round of 63 at Oakmont the year before. Irwin, however, said in 1974: &quot;I&#x27;ve always enjoyed playing tough courses. It&#x27;s much more of a challenge to me.&quot; Irwin earned $35,000 for his victory at Winged Foot and said that he had a vivid dream three weeks earlier that he won the U.S. Open, which he only told his wife about.

Irwin won the Piccadilly World Match Play Championship at Wentworth Club in 1974 and 1975. He missed out on a record-breaking third straight victory when he was beaten in the 1976 final by Australian David Graham on the second sudden-death playoff hole.

Between January 1975 to the end of the 1978 season, Irwin made the cut in 86 consecutive PGA Tour events. To date, this is the fourth-longest streak of consecutive cuts made on the PGA Tour.

In 1977, Irwin&#x27;s three wins on the PGA Tour included a five-shot victory in the Colgate Hall of Fame Classic at Pinehurst Resort. Irwin shot a second round of 62 at Pinehurst for a 15-under par opening 36-hole total of 127, which was the best in any PGA Tour event for over a decade.

Irwin&#x27;s tournament victories kept him ranked high among his peers - he was ranked among the top five in McCormack&#x27;s World Golf Rankings in every year from 1975 to 1979, inclusive. He ranked in the top-10 of the Official World Golf Rankings for a few weeks in 1991.

Irwin added a second U.S. Open title in 1979 at Inverness Club. With its narrow fairways and heavy rough, the Inverness course was a stern test for the players. Irwin&#x27;s final round of 75 tied the post-World War II tournament record for the highest final round score by a U.S. Open champion. The next month in The Open Championship at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club, Irwin came to the final round with a two-shot lead. He was bidding to become one of the few golfers in golf history to win the U.S. Open and British Open in the same year. Irwin said in 1979: &quot;I would dearly love to win the British Open. It is special.&quot; However, he was thwarted in his attempt at an historic double by the incredible recovery play of Seve Ballesteros.

In 1983, Irwin had another close tilt at The Open Championship, but lost by a shot to Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale, after whiffing on a tiny putt of about an inch, during his third round of play. Irwin said that his mistake, which cost him the chance of a playoff with Watson, was &quot;a mental lapse&quot; and that he learned a lesson from it, later being very careful on short putts.

Irwin later said that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: &quot;A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought it would be great to win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer then and I thought it would be wonderful to give him a victory. I destroyed myself with the pressures I&#x27;d built up.&quot;

After his victory in the 1985 Memorial Tournament, Irwin had occasional top-10 finishes in tournaments for the remainder of the decade but he did not have a further official PGA Tour win until an incredible year in 1990, which was capped by his third U.S. Open victory. In a remarkable tournament, Irwin holed an improbable birdie putt on the 72nd hole to join a playoff against fellow American Mike Donald. In the 18-hole Monday playoff, Donald was two shots ahead of Irwin with three holes to play. Donald missed a 15-foot par putt on the 18th which would have given him victory. Both men shot rounds of 74 in the playoff and Irwin won the title with a birdie on the first sudden-death playoff hole. After becoming the oldest ever U.S. Open champion at the age of 45, winning his first PGA Tour event for five years, Irwin was gracious in victory. He said of his playoff opponent Mike Donald: &quot;God bless him. I almost wish he had won.&quot; The following week, Irwin won the Buick Classic.

During his career, Irwin won professional tournaments on all six continents on which golf is played: Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Irwin played on five Ryder Cup teams: 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, and 1991. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.

Irwin&#x27;s final PGA Tour win was at the 1994 MCI Heritage Golf Classic. This win at the age of nearly 49 made him one of the oldest winners in Tour history. Overall, he won prize money of just under six million dollars in his career.

Former U.S. Open champion and television analyst Ken Venturi said of Irwin: &quot;Aesthetically and technically, Hale stands at the ball as well as any player I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

=== Senior career ===
Irwin qualified to play on the over-50 Senior PGA Tour in 1995, and enjoyed even greater success at this level than he did on the PGA Tour. Through the 2021 season, he is the career leader in wins and earnings with 45 victories and over $26 million. Irwin won three consecutive PGA Seniors&#x27; Championships between 1996 and 1998, including a 12-stroke victory in the 1997 tournament, which was the largest ever margin of victory in a 72-hole Champions Tour event until Bernhard Langer&#x27;s 13-stroke victory in the 2014 Senior Open Championship. Irwin&#x27;s nine victories in 1997 tied the Senior Tour record set by Peter Thomson in 1985.

Irwin won the U.S. Senior Open in 1998 and 2000 for a career total of five USGA titles. He narrowly missed out on a third U.S. Senior Open title in 2004 when he finished one stroke behind Peter Jacobsen.

Irwin is the oldest player to finish in the top five in a senior major, with a third-place finish at the 2012 Senior PGA Championship at the age of 66. In the 2012 3M Championship, Irwin shot a score under his age for the first time in his career. His round of 65 included an eagle on the 9th hole and six consecutive birdies on the back nine. Irwin has since gone on to shoot his age 44 times in official PGA Tour Champions events (as of August 11, 2020), well ahead of Gary Player&#x27;s second-place 30. While he has continued to play PGA Tour Champions well into his seventies, he has significantly cut back his tournament schedule, competing in no more than eight tour events in any season since 2015.

In 2000, Irwin was ranked as the 19th greatest golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine.

==Personal life==
Irwin is married to wife Sally and has two children. Irwin&#x27;s son Steve qualified for the 2011 U.S. Open. Steve Irwin said of his father: &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of him. The U.S. Open is what truly defined his career. It&#x27;s been my ultimate goal in golf to play in the U.S. Open since I began competing.&quot;

For 25 years, Hale Irwin helped to raise money for the St. Louis Children&#x27;s Hospital, which named a wing in his honor. Irwin also enjoys hunting and fishing and spending time with his grandchildren. He is the uncle of former CU lineman Heath Irwin.

In 2019, in acknowledgement of his character, sportsmanship and commitment to charity, Irwin received the PGA Tour&#x27;s Payne Stewart Award presented by Southern Company.
