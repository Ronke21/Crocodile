<text>The Agency for French Education Abroad, or Agency for French Teaching Abroad, (; AEFE), is a national public agency under the administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France that assures the quality of schools teaching the French national curriculum outside France. The AEFE has 495 schools in its worldwide network, with French as the primary language of instruction in most schools.

The AEFE head office is in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.
==Curriculum==
Schools are either directly managed (&quot;gestion directe&quot;), contracted (&quot;conventionné&quot;) or accredited (&quot;homologué&quot;). The schools provide an education based on the French national curriculum for pupils of various cultures from preschool through secondary school, and some receive substantial financial support from the French government. The schools provide an education leading to a baccalauréat, and students have access to all other French schools at their own educational level.

In addition, the schools have a curriculum linked to the individual countries in which they are established. The Lycée Français de San Francisco (formerly Lycée Français La Pérouse) and the International School of the Peninsula in San Francisco, for example, include American History and English Literature in its program, and the Lycée Français de Caracas in Venezuela includes History of Venezuela (ICV) from 6th to 9th grade.

Schools are located throughout Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa. Most of their pupils are children of French expatriates but they also include many regular pupils attracted by the quality of schooling provided. In any given academic year, around 160,000 students study in these schools.

==School names==
While there are no public guidelines for naming schools in the AEFE network, they tend to have some similarities. A school that follows the French curriculum through secondary school (high school in the United States and sixth form college in Great Britain) is often named a &quot;Lycée Français&quot; and prepares students for the French baccalauréat. Schools that combine the local and French curricula are often called French-American or Franco-Mexicain schools. Schools that offer the International Baccalaureate are often called International School or &quot;Lycée International&quot;.

<text>The Lamborghini V12 refers to the flagship V12 engine used by Lamborghini. Lamborghini has had two generations of V12 engines through their history, both of which were developed in-house. The first-generation Lamborghini V12 was a sixty degree (60°) V12 petrol engine designed by Lamborghini, and was the first internal combustion engine ever produced by the firm.

It entered production in 1963 as a 3.5 litre displacing fitted on Lamborghini&#x27;s first car, the Lamborghini 350GT. The engine remained in use for almost fifty years; the final version of 6.5 litre displacement was installed in the Lamborghini Murciélago. Lamborghini discontinued their first-generation V12 after the Murcielago, opting for a brand-new V12 that first saw use on the Lamborghini Aventador.

==History==

When Ferruccio Lamborghini set out to compete with Ferrari, he contracted Giotto Bizzarrini to design the engine for his car and, according to some accounts, paid him a bonus for every horsepower over what Ferrari&#x27;s V12 could produce. The finished V12, with minor improvements, went on to become the 6.5 litre powering the Lamborghini Murciélago LP 640, and completed its service for Lamborghini with the final version of the Murciélago, the Murciélago LP 670-4 SuperVeloce.

==Technical overview==
The engine was designed from the start to be a quad cam 60 degree V12 - as an intentional snub to Ferrari&#x27;s single overhead camshaft per-bank design. When the prototype was tested in 1963, it was able to produce at 9,000 (rpm), or almost per litre. Bizzarrini insisted the engine was mechanically capable of reaching at 11,000 rpm with an uprated fuel system, but the design was judged adequate, and when fitted with production carburettors, all the auxiliary systems, and detuned for road use, the engine still made .

Over the years, this V12 engine has nearly doubled in displacement - first to , and later to . It has seen the modification of the cylinder heads to allow four valves per cylinder, the replacement of Weber carburettors with electronic fuel injection, and the re-engineering of the lubrication system from a wet to a dry sump design. However, the engine that powers the Murciélago LP 640 can trace its lineage directly to the F1-inspired design of Bizzarrini and his team more than forty years ago.

==Audi ownership and V12 successor==

When Automobili Lamborghini was purchased in 1998 by the German Volkswagen Group subsidiary Audi AG, the V12 engine continued undergoing constant upgrades, growing its displacement from 5.7 litres (Diablo VT) to the final displacement of 6.5 litres in the Murciélago LP670-4 Superveloce.
It took years to decide that a new engine was needed to be built from scratch, finally an all-new engine codenamed L539 having a displacement of 6.5 litres for the 2011 Aventador was developed. The new engine has a maximum power output of , is 18 kg lighter, is over-square (95mm bore, 76.4mm stroke) and has a different firing order: 1–12–4–9–2–11–6–7–3–10–5–8 instead of 1–7–4–10–2–8–6–12–3–9–5–11.

==Formula One==
Lamborghini made the move to Formula One in when the FIA outlawed turbocharged engines. Former Scuderia Ferrari designer / engineer Mauro Forghieri was commissioned to design and build a new, 3.5 litre V12 engine for use by the French Larrousse team in 1989. Dubbed the Lamborghini LE3512, (Lamborghini Engineering 3.5 liters 12 cylinders) the , 80° V12 engine was reported to be the best sounding engine of the new 3.5L naturally aspirated formula. Lamborghini representatives stated at the engines début race, the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, that they chose a lower ranked team to join Formula One (Larrousse was in its third season using Lola chassis&#x27;) as it was felt at the early stage of its development the 3512 would not be able to do justice to one of the teams usually closer to the front of the grid. Also, the front running teams already had existing engine suppliers in place (McLaren with Honda, Williams with Renault, Benetton with Ford, and Ferrari who made their own V12 engines).

The Lamborghini V12 did impress many in 1989 despite its unreliability, and the engines best result in its first year came thanks to fast but accident prone Larrousse driver Philippe Alliot when he qualified his Lola LC89 in 5th position for the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez, only 1.417 seconds slower than the V10 McLaren-Honda of pole winner Ayrton Senna. Alliot then backed up that performance by scoring the engine&#x27;s first point in Formula One by finishing 6th in the race and setting the 4th fastest race lap in the process. Unfortunately, Alliot&#x27;s teammate for the second half of 1989, former Ferrari driver Michele Alboreto, never came to grips with either the Lola or the Lamborghini. In his eight races for Larrousse he recorded four DNF&#x27;s, two failures to pre-qualify, one failure to qualify, and a single 11th-place finish in Portugal.

The Lamborghini V12&#x27;s best finish came when Larrousse driver Aguri Suzuki finished 3rd in the infamous 1990 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka. Its time in Formula One (1989-1993) would prove to be frustrating though as poor reliability became the norm for the engine, despite being used by Grand Prix winning teams such as Lotus and Ligier who could boast driving talent such as Derek Warwick (Lotus - 1990), and Thierry Boutsen (Ligier - 1991). In a 2014 interview, Warwick said of the 3512 that it was &quot;All noise and no go&quot;.

In 1993 after four years in Formula One with only one significant result for the engine, Bob Lutz of Lamborghini&#x27;s parent company Chrysler, did a hand-shake deal with McLaren boss Ron Dennis for the team to test the LE3512 to evaluate its potential as a race winner. McLaren made a modified version of their race car, the McLaren MP4/8 dubbed the MP4/8B, to test the engine (the test car took three months to modify to fit the longer and heavier V12). Testing was completed by triple World Champion Ayrton Senna, and future dual World Champion Mika Häkkinen at both the Silverstone Circuit in England and the Estoril circuit in Portugal. After his first drive of the car at Silverstone, Senna suggested certain changes to Forghieri (a less brutal &#x27;top end&#x27; and a fatter mid-range), and he complied with engine power increased from to approximately and both drivers were very impressed despite the engine still being somewhat unreliable (Häkkinen reported a massive engine blow up while testing at Silverstone, though he did manage to lap the 5.226 km (3.260 mi) circuit some 1.4 seconds faster than the teams MP4/8 race car powered by a Ford V8 engine). According to reports, Senna even wanted to race the engine at the Japanese Grand Prix believing that while reliability might be a problem, at least he would be quicker than with the Ford powered race car (ironically Senna would win in both Japan and the last race in Australia with the existing MP4/8). Despite this however, Ron Dennis decided to go with Peugeot V10 engines in due to a better commercial agreement that would give long term stability to the team and at the end of the 1993 season, the Lamborghini LE3512 was retired from Grand Prix racing after the company was sold by Chrysler to an Indonesian investor group led by Tommy Suharto.

The Lamborghini, which on all cars it powered carried the words &quot;Chrysler powered by Lamborghini&quot; (other than the McLaren MP4/8B which was all virgin white, though the test engines were badged as Chrysler), was one of only five V12 engines used in the naturally aspirated era from 1989–2013, the others being from Ferrari (1989-1995), Honda (1991-1992), Yamaha (1991-1992), and Porsche (1991). The only other 12 cylinder engines in Formula One during this time were disastrous efforts by Life Racing Engines with their W12 engine and Subaru who reintroduced the Flat 12 to the sport, both appearing in the first half of 1990.

<text>Lummi sticks, named after the Lummi Native American peoples, are hardwood cylindrical sticks, usually roughly 7 inches long and 0.75 inches in diameter, used as percussive musical instruments. They are generally struck against one another, and used frequently in musical education to teach rhythm.

Another variety, called simply a rhythm stick, is 12 inches long and painted blue. These are generally either cylindrical or fluted, and come in sets containing an equal number of both.

The sticks are used in elementary school education in the US and Canada.

<text>Yosu National University () was a government-run university in Yeosu City, on the coast of South Jeolla province, South Korea. It is now the Yosu campus of Chonnam National University, after merging with it in March 2006. Although it has a strong traditional focus on fisheries study, the university now offers programs in a wide range of fields, such as Chinese studies and business administration. The 2002 undergraduate enrollment was reported at 6,461, with 453 graduate students. 166 full-time instructors were employed.

==History==
Yosu was the first school of fisheries science to be opened in Korea. It was founded in 1917 as &quot;Yosu Public Miniature Fisheries School&quot; (여수공립간이수산학교). University presidents during this period were all Japanese. After national liberation in 1946, the school moved to its current location, and management was taken over by the South Korean government. It was made a technical school in 1963, and a technical college in 1975. In 1987, it became a full college with seven departments but remained specifically a Fisheries College. The school became a university (Yosu National Fisheries University) in 1993 and changed its name to simply Yosu National University in 1998. The school began granting doctoral degrees in 1997.

In March 2006, Yosu National University merged with Chonnam National University.

<text>River Heights is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957, and formally came into existence in the 1958 provincial election. The riding is located in the south-central region of the City of Winnipeg.

River Heights is bordered to the east by Fort Rouge (formerly Lord Roberts), to the southeast by Fort Garry, to the south by Fort Whyte, to the north by Wolseley (across the Assiniboine River), and to the west by Tuxedo.

From 1958 to 1986, River Heights was represented by members of the Progressive Conservative Party. Since that time, however, it has generally been represented by leaders of the provincial Liberal Party. Sharon Carstairs represented the riding from 1986 until her appointment to the Senate of Canada in 1994, and Jon Gerrard represented the riding from 1999 until 2023 when he lost the seat to NDP candidate Mike Moroz. Moroz is the first New Democrat ever to represent the constituency.

The Liberal Party has many prominent backers in this riding, including members of the Asper family (see Izzy Asper).

==Statistical overview==
The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,950. The riding&#x27;s character is middle- and upper-middle class. In 1999, the average family income was $77,701, and the unemployment rate was 5.90%. River Heights includes many of Winnipeg&#x27;s oldest and stateliest homes: the average value of dwelling house in the riding in 1999 was $117,937.

River Heights has a significant Jewish population, at 9% of the total. The highest percentage of people in Manitoba at the riding level have university degrees, at 38.5%. Voter turnout also tends to be extremely high in this riding; in its first four decades, turnout usually exceeded 80% of the eligible population.

The service sector accounts for 15% of industry in River Heights, with educational services following at 14%.

<doc id="1279651" wikidata="Q168565" url="?curid=1279651" title="Ghost station">
<text>A ghost station is a disused train station through which revenue-service passenger trains (especially rapid transit trains) pass but at which they do not stop. The term is also sometimes used for any unused underground station or any unused station, whether or not trains pass through them. In Germany, a station that has been built in the course of constructing something else as a so-called &quot;Bauvorleistung&quot; (roughly: construction pre-effort) is referred to as a &quot;ghost station&quot;, despite the different purpose and origin of the terms. Some English-language publications also refer to &quot;pre-built&quot; stations or parts thereof that have yet to see service as &quot;ghost stations&quot;.

==Origin of the term==
The term &quot;ghost station&quot; is a calque of the German word (plural ). The German term was coined to describe certain stations on Berlin&#x27;s and metro networks that were closed during the period of Berlin&#x27;s division during the Cold War because they were an integral part of a transit line mostly located on the other side of the Berlin Wall.

==Ghost stations in Berlin==

===Background===
In August 1961 the East German government built the Berlin Wall, ending freedom of movement between East and West Berlin. As a result, the Berlin public transit network, which had formerly spanned both halves of the city, was also divided into two. Some and lines fell entirely into one half of the city or the other; other lines were divided between the two jurisdictions, with trains running only to the border and then turning back. However, there were three lines—the lines now designated U6 and U8, and the Tunnel on the —that ran for the most part through West Berlin but passed for a short distance through the borough of Mitte (the historic city centre), which was East Berlin territory. These lines continued to be open to West Berliners; however, trains did not stop at most of the stations located within East Berlin, though for technical reasons they did have to slow down significantly while passing through. (Trains did stop at , on which more below.) The name was soon aptly applied to these dimly lit, heavily guarded stations by travellers from West Berlin, who watched them pass by through the carriage windows. However, the term was never official; West Berlin maps of the period simply labelled these stations &quot; (&quot;stations at which the trains do not stop&quot;). East Berlin maps neither depicted the West Berlin lines nor the ghost stations. maps in the transfer station were unique: They depicted all the Western lines, but not the , and showed the city divided into &quot;&quot; (&quot;Berlin, capital of the German Democratic Republic&quot;) and &quot;&quot;, the official terminology used by East Germany.

The lines were a vital part of the West Berlin transit network, but because part of the route of some of the lines lay in East Berlin territory, it was difficult for Western support staff to perform maintenance work on the tracks and tunnels. If a train on a West Berlin line broke down in East Berlin territory, then passengers had to wait for Eastern border police to appear and escort them out. The East German government occasionally hinted that it might someday block access to the tunnels at the border and run its own service on the East Berlin sections of these lines. However, this awkward status quo persisted for the entire 28-year period of the division of Berlin.

At the closed stations, barbed wire fences were installed to prevent any would-be escapees from East Berlin from accessing the track bed, and the electrically live third rail served as an additional and potentially lethal deterrent. An alarm was triggered if anyone breached one of the barriers. As for the entrances, the signage was removed, walkways were walled up and stairways were sealed with concrete slabs. Police stations were built into the windowed platform service booths, from which the whole platform area could be monitored.

A wide white line on the wall marked the exact location of the border. Later, gates were installed at some stations that could be rolled into place at night while the guards were off-duty. Guard posts at other stations were staffed continuously, creating additional employment positions with the transport police. In the platform area, the guards always worked in pairs, and care was taken in their assignment to assure that there would be no personal ties between them. In addition, superior officers could conduct surprise inspections at any time, thus, maintaining maximum security. Other stations were secured by the East German border guards.

===Particular stations===
station, though served by Western lines and located in East Berlin territory, was not a . Instead, it served as a transfer point between U6 and several lines. Western passengers could walk from one platform to another without ever leaving the station or having to show papers, much like air travellers changing planes at an international airport. Westerners with appropriate visas could also enter East Berlin there (they could even get a visa in the station). There was an Intershop in the station that could be accessed without having to pass a border or customs checkpoint of either East or West Germany and it was thus a popular place for westerners to buy cheap alcohol in D-Mark, but the West Berlin customs considered goods bought there contraband and did spot checks on what they considered customs evasion.

The station was the only ghost station not located in a tunnel. It was situated close to the wall near the border crossing. West Berlin trains passed through it without stopping. East Berlin trains passed the same station but on different tracks. The tracks used by Western and Eastern trains were sealed off from each other by a tall fence.

Another oddity was station. Like , it was an stop served by West Berlin trains, but located on East Berlin territory just behind the border. However, was in use and accessible for West Berliners, as one of its exits opened on a West Berlin street. This exit was exactly on the border line, a warning sign next to it informing passengers about the situation. Its other exits to East Berlin streets were blocked.

===Reopening===

The first people to enter the ghost stations after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 found that they lived up to their informal name, with ads and signage on the walls unchanged since 1961. None of them have been preserved.

The first ghost station to reopen to passenger traffic was (U8) on 11 November 1989, two days after the fall of the Wall. It was equipped with a checkpoint within the station akin to , where East German customs and border control were provisionally installed to facilitate passengers heading to or coming from East Berlin. Hand-drawn destination signs were hung up covering the old ones from pre-1961; these signs were both crumbling from age and obviously missing the termini of post-1961 line extensions. On 22 December 1989, (U8) was reopened with a similar provisional checkpoint.

On 12 April 1990, the third station to reopen was (U8). As its northern exit was directly on the border, it could be opened with direct access to West Berlin without the need of a checkpoint. Its southern exit towards East Berlin was not reopened until 1 July 1990.

Discussions on reopening all the U6 and U8 stations including the S-Bahn station , and had begun on 13 April 1990 without border controls. These took two months to clean up, removing all the dirt and refurbishing the interiors; all stations had been reopened on 1 July 1990 at 11 a.m., as East Berlin and East Germany had adopted the West German currency (DM), leaving the border checkpoints abandoned.
On 2 July 1990, was the first ghost station on the to reopen. On 1 September 1990, and were opened following reconstruction works. On 12 December 1990, was reopened for West Berlin trains; a second platform for East Berlin trains allowing interchange followed on 5 August 1991. The very last ghost station to reopen was , which opened on 3 March 1992, following an extensive restoration of the entire North–South tunnel.

In the following years, the city and German government put a great deal of effort into restoring and reunifying the and networks in Berlin. The U-Bahn system reached its pre-war status in 1995 with the reopening of on U1. The system reached a preliminary completion in 2002 (with the reopening of the ring), even though there are still disused sections of lines closed in the aftermath of the wall. Decisions on reopening of some of these sections are still to be made. There was a political promise made in the course of reunification that all S-Bahn lines and services shut down due to partition were to be restored - with federal funds if need be - but as of 2021 this is still not the case and some former services are seen to be as of lower importance than proposed entirely new construction.

===List of all Berlin ghost stations===
This list only includes those stations in East Berlin territory that western trains passed through without stopping. There were other stations on both sides of the wall that were closed during the division because those sections of track were not in use.

Temporary checkpoints were set up for stations with access to East Berlin that were reopened before 1 July 1990. Checkpoints were no longer necessary for those reopened after that date when border checks were eliminated with the currency union between East and West Germany.

===New ghost stations after reunification===
In contrast with the above-listed stations, multiple stations in the Berlin area that were of high importance during the Cold War rapidly lost importance and passengers after reunification, some to the point of becoming ghost stations. The most notable examples are:

* : station on the Berlin Outer Ring located due south of Berlin, quite far from any populated place, lost its importance with the resumption of direct routes from the Potsdam area to East Berlin and due to the reduction of the workforce in the factory located nearby. Trains running between Potsdam and the station stopped at the station until December 2012. Since then all passenger trains pass through without stopping and it was officially reclassified to a (service station). A train stop named was built 2 km to the west (closer to populated areas) and brought into service with the closure of the station.
* : an interchange station also located on the Berlin Outer Ring on the outskirts of Potsdam, named (Potsdam Main station) between 1961 and 1993, was the most important station of Potsdam when the traffic flow to West Berlin (Berlin–Magdeburg railway) was severely restricted. After resumption of service between Potsdam and station, the station lost its importance, became unstaffed in 1994. Tracks on the upper deck were demolished in 1999 (leaving only a pair of through tracks not adjacent to any platform), and on the lower deck only a single platform was left in service for use by the local trains from Potsdam to . Although its present-day importance is negligible and its decaying appearance is not unlike &quot;real&quot; ghost stations from the Cold War era, it still has regular passenger trains stopping at it.
* Due to the delays in opening Berlin Brandenburg Airport the train station serving it (which was ready for use on the originally planned opening date in 2012) was served by empty trains to prevent mold.
*Französische Straße (Berlin U-Bahn) mentioned above shut down permanently in December 2020 when the new interchange station with the extended U5 opened as the two are too close to each other. It is thus the only Berlin U-Bahn station to be a ghost station twice over and for entirely different reasons.

==Ghost stations elsewhere==
===Argentina===

The Underground has four ghost stations. The two stations on Line A were originally two single-platform stations closed in 1953 since their close proximity meant trains had to stop in quick succession and frequencies were reduced. Their opposing platforms, located just metres away from each of the ghost stations, still remain open as and stations. The stations are preserved to maintain their original appearance and can still be seen when travelling on the line, even being used as a display for a time.

On Line E, the two stations were closed in 1966 when the line was re-routed closer to the centre of in order to improve passenger numbers. They have both been used as maintenance areas for Line E and Line C, while one of the stations served as a set for the 1996 Argentine film . The stations were under consideration to be re-purposed as part of the new Line F, however it was later decided to build new tunnels instead.

There are also two stations ( and ) on Line E and Line D which were designed to be used as temporary stations while their respective lines were being extended. Though the platforms remain, they cannot be considered true ghost stations since they were never intended to be a permanent part of the network and designed to be re-purposed as electrical substations once the permanent stations were built.

===Australia===
* General Motors on the Gippsland railway line. (Not an underground station, nor part of an underground network).
* Nyanda on the Gold Coast railway line. (Not an underground station, nor part of an underground network).
*Woollahra on the Eastern Suburbs railway line. (Not an underground station, partially constructed but never opened).

===Austria===
* Vienna Underground Railway (): Station of line U2 closed in 2003 and the old station. The U2 station is planned to be in use in 2024, but not yet opened. 
* Vienna Rapid Transit (): several stations have been closed: , , in 1939, the old station, in 2000, in 2004, in 2010

===Belgium===
* The Charleroi light rail system is notable for several stations and lines built but never opened.

===Brazil===
* (São Paulo Metro), platforms of the Moema branch, never opened
* (São Paulo Metro), underground docks that would serve the Southeast-Southwest line, but which would not have been put into service
* Pirelli Station (CPTM São Paulo) in Santo André
* Paranapiacaba Station (CPTM São Paulo) in Paranapiacaba in Santo André
* station, in . An old station formerly used in a passenger train line from to , and currently only cargo trains pass through it in service, while metropolitan trains operated by the line only pass there while maneuvering. station of the Trensurb, serving Porto Alegre airport, was built right beside the station.

===Bulgaria===
* St. Naum Station () and NDK Station () of the Sofia Metro. Both stations were built in the 1980s, together with the National Palace of Culture and the redevelopment of the surrounding area. Currently these stations are fully completed and had become operational on 31 August 2012. St. Naum Station is operating under the name of European Union Metro Station.
* Station (). The station should be in operation with lines 2 &amp; 4 by 2035.

===Canada===
* Lower Bay in Toronto. Below the main platform for Bay station is an abandoned level which was used for only six months in 1966 when the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) experimentally interlined portions of both the Yonge–University and Bloor–Danforth lines. This abandoned platform is sometimes referred to as &quot;Lower Bay&quot; by the general public or &quot;Bay Lower&quot; by the TTC.
* Municipal Building in Calgary. A downtown subway was originally planned under 8th Avenue for the Calgary C-Train. In preparation, a short section of tunnel and underground LRT station were built under the Calgary Municipal Building when it was constructed in 1985. Subway plans were halted because the initial surface line on 7th Avenue turned out to have much more passenger capacity than expected. The underground station and downtown subway may be completed in the foreseeable future as future C-Train lines which are under construction and proposed will exceed the capacity of the 7th Avenue surface line.
* Edmonton LRT. An underground LRT station was built between Stadium and Churchill stations as a proposed future light rail station. There is concrete poured to form two elevator shafts and part of the platform. There are concrete walls that block stairs that go to the Edmonton Remand Centre and to the Edmonton Law Courts.

===Chile===
* Libertad station, located between Cumming and in Line 5 of the, is a ghost station that was never opened because of insufficient passenger demand for the station due to the low density of people traveling around and through it.
* Echeverría is a ghost station located in Line 4A, also closed because of the low density of people traveling around and through it.
* The original project of the line 3 side of Puente Cal y Canto metro station is also a ghost station. The entire line 3 was canceled because of the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake.

===China===
*The western part of Line 1 of the Beijing Subway (Fushouling and 53# station) has not yet been opened to the public. Fushouling station is under renovation and will open to the public in 2024.

*Liaoning Road station on Line 3 of the Changchun Rail Transit was permanently closed in 2017 and will no longer reopened, making it the first light rail station to be permanently close in China. The station was demolished in August 2021.

* was the former terminus of Line 1 of the Tianjin Metro. After Line 1 was shut down for renovation on 2001, the station was permanently closed. It was the first subway station in Chinese history to be permanently closed. The surface entrance has been demolished, and it can only be accessed via the track. Line 1 also has 2 stations unopened to the public due to low ridership, which are Lishuanglubei and Shangguozhuang, it also have 1 relocated station Yingkoudao, which relocated to the east side of now-abandoned former station.

*On Line 7 of the Shenzhen Metro, there are two stations that have not been opened to the public. They are and Fulin station. Fulin station was initially opposed by most of the surrounding residents during construction, so it was reserved for the development of the Lok Ma Chau Loop area. Currently, all trains on Line 7 can only pass through Fulin station without stopping. Although Wenti Park station has been fully built, it is currently only open to internal subway employees commuting to the Shenyun depot and has not yet been opened to the public. The opening date is yet to be determined.

*Due to housing demolition issues, Shahe station on Line 6 of the Guangzhou Metro cannot have a station lobby and equipment floor, so only the platform level was built. Therefore, it is unable to handle passenger boarding and alighting services, and all trains pass through the station without stopping. In response to changes in land planning, the station is currently being constructed as an interchange station on Line 11 and is expected to be opened simultaneously with that line.

===Denmark===
* station is a former surface station on (line A), which is a part of the network in Copenhagen. The station was closed in 2007 when the station (&quot;New station&quot;) was built when (line F) was extended, with connections between these two lines.

===Finland===
*The Kamppi metro station has an unused north–south station, below and at right angles to the east–west one currently in use. Excavated at the same time as the east–west station, it was never outfitted, because the corresponding north–south metro line was never built. 
*The Hakaniemi metro station has another similar ghost station, built for the U-line which was eventually not constructed, and its excavation remains incomplete. They have no trains and are not accessible. 
*The University of Helsinki metro station is a former ghost station, since it was excavated in the late 1970s, but opened to the public in 1995. 
*Under Munkkivuori Shopping Centre in Helsinki is an unfinished space for Helsinki Metro station. The space was reserved during expansion work of the shopping centre in early 60s but never used.

===France===

===Germany===
Apart from Berlin (which also has provisions for future extensions that serve no current purpose):

* Light Railway (): station , built, but never opened
* Rapid Transit (): station closed since 1990 and Station at Airport since 1998
* Underground Railway (): station , built, but never opened; station on line U2 and station 
* Hanover Light Railway (): part of station , built, but never opened
* Cologne Light Railway (): station closed in 2003, , built, but never opened
* Tramway: tramway underground stations and (partially)
* Munich Rapid Transit (): München Olympiastadion station closed in 1988
* Nuremberg Ring Railway: stations and closed in 1992; the former station &quot;Märzfeld&quot; served the Nazi party rallying grounds and later deportations to the Nazi death camps. It can be visited in guided tours.
* Nuremberg U-Bahn: minor provisions made for a future infill station between Flughafen station and Ziegelstein station; there is an emergency exit near the proposed site of this tentative &quot;Marienberg station&quot;

On some German high speed lines there are provisions made at overtaking stations (which serve an important function for operating trains, but do not appear obvious to most passengers as having any purpose) to allow for (conversion to) passenger service more easily in the future. In some cases this is as little as leaving more space between tracks to allow for the future construction of platforms, while in others there are significant parts of a passenger station constructed before the decision to not serve it after all is made. An example that has attracted particular public debate regarding the feasibility and desirability of passenger service is Ilmenau-Wolfsberg service station in a forest near Ilmenau along the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway.

=== Hong Kong ===
* Rumsey station in the MTR. This platform was originally reserved for the East Kowloon line proposal in the 1970s, in order to minimise the effects on the Island line. However, these platforms are now abandoned and brick walls have been placed at the two ends of the long platforms to block them off. The station is now merged into and formerly served as the terminus of the Island line before the opening of West Island line. Since the platforms were built as the upper platforms, and the proposed Rumsey station concourse was redeveloped as east concourse of Sheung Wan station, passengers going to and from exit E (proposed exit for Rumsey station) must pass through the abandoned platforms. In preparation for the opening of the West Island line extension the station was renovated, and the track area along the platforms was walled off.
* A ghost station, Kwu Tung exists on the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line of the East Rail line. Currently, the station only has an underground station box structure and a ventilation shaft. Construction of the station resumes in 2023 and will start operations in 2027.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesia has some ghost stations like Gunung Putri railway station and Pondok Rajeg railway station.

===Ireland===
Brennanstown station exists on the Green Line of the Luas tram system in Dublin, between Ballyogan Wood and Carrickmines. It was intended to service new suburbs, but, the post-2008 Irish economic downturn meant that the suburbs were never built and the tram passes through empty fields at that point on the line. The station is labelled &quot;Future Stop&quot; on the route map.

===Israel===
Rosh HaAyin South railway station became a ghost station on Israel Railways network in 2003, when the line it served as a terminus was extended towards Kfar Saba–Nordau railway station, and a new station, serving Rosh HaAyin was built a couple of kilometers to the north.

=== Italy ===
Italy does not have a long list of ghost stations. Amongst the few examples is Quintiliani, on Line B of the Rome Metro. It was built in 1990 as part of the extension towards the northeast of Line B, but was kept unused because it was meant to serve a planned business district called &quot;Sistema Direzionale Orientale&quot; (&quot;Eastern Directional District&quot;) that was never realized.

In the early 2000s the project of the S.D.O. was cancelled and the station, which was in the middle of nowhere, was taken in charge by the Municipality of Rome and renewed to make it compliant with the new security rules issued in the meantime; a new bus line was established to link the station to the nearby Sandro Pertini general hospital. On 23 June 2003 it was officially opened to passenger traffic, ending a 13-year long period of ghost station status.

===Japan===

<text>Machine Gun Etiquette is the third studio album by English punk rock band the Damned, released on 9 November 1979 by Chiswick Records. The album peaked at No. 31 on the UK Charts

The album was the group&#x27;s first since reforming with a new lineup of previous members Dave Vanian on vocals, Captain Sensible on lead guitar, Rat Scabies on drums, plus newcomer Algy Ward of Australian punk band The Saints on bass guitar on his only album with the band.

== Background ==
On &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot;, the band brought more variety to their usual punk rock to add wide-ranging influences from hard rock and heavy metal to psychedelic rock, a tinge of progressive rock and even classic 1960s rhythm and blues and the record has been described by journalists and fans alike as The Beach Boys meets Motörhead with T. Rex and Judas Priest influences thrown in for good measure. The album also features more fast-paced punk tracks, and has been cited as a &#x27;proto-hardcore&#x27; record crucial for the later rise of hardcore punk into the 1980s.

The voice at the album&#x27;s start is actor Jack Howarth, taken from his 1971 album &quot;″Ow Do&quot;, a recording of Lancastrian monologues.

The album features multiple guest musicians. Lemmy plays bass on the band&#x27;s take on The Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Ballroom Blitz&quot;, which was not on the album at time of release but released as a single; the song was also added to the reissued version of the album. Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon also appear on the album. Philip Lloyd-Smee contributed to the sleeve and logo design work on &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot;.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review reported that when it was released, &quot;Machine Gun Etiquette&quot; was &quot;deservedly hailed as another classic from the band&quot;. The website praised the variety of styles explored and the group&#x27;s typically strong wit. 

Scott Rowley of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, reviewing the 25th Anniversary Edition of the album, defined it as &quot;a riotous, ballsy rush of an album [...] the sound of a band coming into its own&quot;, adding that &quot;while the Clash looked to America for inspiration, the Damned remained resolutely British&quot;, perhaps ironically given that the front cover depicted the band in a New York street scene at 704 7th Avenue, New York City.

*&quot;Smash It Up (Part 1)&quot; and &quot;Smash It Up (Part 2)&quot; are listed as one track on the CD, as &quot;Smash It Up (Parts 1 and 2)&quot; (track 11).

<text>The Podolian Voivodeship or Palatinate of Podolia was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland, from 1434 until 1793, except for the period of Ottoman occupation (1672–1699), when the region was organized as Podolia Eyalet. Together with the Bracław Voivodeship it formed the region of Podolia, which in the Kingdom of Poland was part of Lesser Poland Province. Its capital was in Kamieniec Podolski, where local sejmiks took place and where the seat of the starosta was as well.

The voivodeship was created 1434, out of former Duchy of Podolia, which had become part of the Kingdom of Poland in the second half of the 14th century. After the Second Partition of Poland, it was seized by the Russian Empire, which in 1793 created the Podolia Governorate. Today the region belongs to Ukraine.
Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book &quot;Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland&quot; gives a detailed description of Podole Voivodeship:
In ancient times, Podole was a borderland of permanent Slavic settlements, behind which were steppes, inhabited by nomadic tribes. Proximity of these Barbaric tribes made it impossible for the Slavs to take full advantage of Podole, which is the most beautiful and the richest of all Slavic lands (...) For many years borders of Podole were not defined. The province was captured by the Tatars in the 13th century. They in return were chased away by the Lithuanians, who in the mid-14th century clashed here with Poland. Podole was in 1352 captured by Algirdas, and in 1396 King Wladyslaw Jagiello placed this land under Spytek of Melsztyn. Later on, Podole was ruled by Svitrigaila, and finally in 1434 the Sejm created Podole Voivodeship, naming Piotr Odrowaz the first voivode. Still, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania continued to claim this land, and the conflict was ended by the 1569 Union of Lublin (...) If it had not been for thousands of Polish szlachta families, who since the 14th century settled here, Podole would remain a deserted steppe (...)

Boundaries of the new voivodeship were as follows: in northwest it bordered Trembowla County of Ruthenian Voivodeship, in the north it bordered Volhynian Voivodeship, while in the east it touched Braclaw Voivodeship. Whole southern and southwestern border went along the Dniestr and the Stypa rivers (...) In its early years, Podole Voivodeship had a number of small counties, which were located around royal castles. In the 15th century, there were counties of Skala Podolska, Smotrycz, Bakota, Latyczow, Miedzyboz, Chmielnik, Zinkow, and Bar. Finally, in 1542 only three counties were established, at Czerwonogrod, Kamieniec and Latyczow (...)

In the 16th century, Podole Voivodeship had 37 towns, and according to the 1578 census, there were 650 villages. By 1583, the number of villages was reduced to only 434, due to constant Crimean Tatar raids. The voivodeship also had 35 castles and forts (...)

Podole Voivodeship had three senators: the Bishop, the Voivode and the Castellan of Kamieniec. Local starosta, who also used the title &quot;General of Podolian Lands&quot;, governed two towns, those of Kamieniec and Latyczow. There also were starostas at Czerwonogrod, Bar, Chmielnik, Kopajgrod, Mukarow, Ploskirow and others. Sejmiks took place at Kamieniec, where six deputies to the Sejm were elected, as well as two deputies to the Lesser Poland Tribunal at Lublin (...) Podole Voivodeship had two border judges, who cooperated with officials of the Ottoman Porte, solving border conflicts.

<text>The Bracław Voivodeship (; ; , &quot;Braclavśke vojevodstvo&quot;) was a unit of administrative division of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Created in 1566 as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it was passed to the Kingdom of Poland in 1569 following the Union of Lublin. After Second Partition of Poland in 1793 the voivodeship was taken by the Russian Empire and replaced with the Bratslav Viceroyalty.

In 1648-57 the territory of voivodeship was a part of Cossack Hetmanate following the Khmelnytsky Uprising and Truce of Andrusovo, while in 1672-99 it became part of Ottoman Ukraine which was a vassal Ottoman Empire (see: Treaty of Buchach and Treaty of Karlowitz).

==Overview==
Together with the Podolian Voivodeship it formed the historical region of Podolia and part of a bigger Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

Officially, the capital of the voivodeship was in Braclaw (today Bratslav), but local voivodes also resided in Winnica (Vinnytsia). It was divided into County of Braclaw and County of Winnica. The County of Braclaw itself was divided into two districts—Braclaw and Zwinogródek (some sources claim there was a separate County of Zwinogródek). In 1791, the Great Sejm also created Boh County (Polish: powiat nadbohski), but it was never created due to the Polish–Russian War of 1792. Braclaw Voivodeship had two senators—the Voivode and the Castellan of Braclaw. It also had six deputies to the Sejm—two from Braclaw County, two from Winnica County, and two from District of Zwinogródek. Local sejmiks took place in Winnica. Today the region belongs to Ukraine and Transnistria in Moldova.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book &quot;Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland&quot; gives a detailed description of Braclaw Voivodeship:

After the Union of Lublin, the province of Podolia was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland. Soon afterwards, Ukrainian Podolia, located lower than Podole Voivodeship, between the Dniestr and the Boh rivers, was turned into Braclaw Voivodeship. It had three castles at Braclaw, Winnica and Zwinogrod (...) In 1570, a special royal commission was created to mark the borders of the voivodeship. Its western boundary was marked by the Murachwa river, and in the southeast, it was separated from Wallachia by the Dniestr. The commission marked northern border of the voivodeship along the Black Tatar Trail, and to settle arguments between Braclaw and Kijow Voivodeships, King Stefan Batory in 1584 stated that boundary line was to be marked by the Uhorski Tykicz river (...)

In the late 16th century, most of Braclaw Voivodeship was a depopulated wild field. Political and social life existed only in the agricultural belt, located in the immediate vicinity of royal castles. Settlers however began to move into the desert, even along southern border of the province, in the area called Pobereze (...) After the Union of Lublin, when Ukrainian lands were annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, life became more organized, with Polish-style starostas, voivodes, nobility, sejmiks, and courts (...) 

The County of Winnica was smaller, but more populated. It had the area of 200 sq. miles, in northwestern corner of the voivodeship, along the Boh river. The County of Braclaw had the area of 420 sq. miles, and consisted of two districts - Bracław and Zwinogrod. The district of Zwinogrod covered the desert of the Blue Waters (see also Battle of Blue Waters), but due to destruction of the Zwinogrod Castle, it did not emerge as a separate county (...) In 1584, Stefan Batory divided this area between Braclaw and Kijow Voivodeship, along the Uhorski Tykicz river (...)

In 1569, first voivode of Braclaw was Prince Roman Sanguszko, while first castellan was Knyaz Jedrzej Kapusta. In 1589 Polish Sejm ordered that all official documents in Braclaw Voivodeship should be written in Old East Slavic language (...) The voivodeship had two senators (the voivode and the castellan of Braclaw), six deputies to the Sejm, and two deputies to the Lesser Poland Tribunal at Lublin. Furthermore, like in neighbouring Podole Voivodeship, Braclaw had its own border judges, who cooperated with officials of the Ottoman Porte and the Crimean Khanate, solving conflicts between citizens of the two countries (...)

In 1598 the Sejm ordered that all courts and sejmiks be moved from Braclaw to Winnica. As a result, Winnica came to be regarded the capital of the voivodeship. Since in the 18th century the population of the region grew, in 1791 the Sejm created another county, called Boh County, increasing number of deputies from the voivodeship from six to eight. After the Partitions of Poland, Russian authorities created Braclaw Governorate (1793 - 1796), whose lands were then divided between Podolia Governorate, Volhynian Governorate, and Kiev Governorate (...) 

According to the 1625 census, Braclaw Voivodeship had 285 villages, but its population grew so fast that in the early 1790s, the number of villages grew to 1,500 (...) Before the Union of Lublin, there were some 30 castles, forts and strongholds in the province. Fifty years after the union, the number of castles grew significantly. Most of them were private, with the strongest one being Uman (...) In the 18th century, the voivodeship had several grand residences of Polish magnates, among them was Zofiowka of the Potocki family, located in close proximity to Uman.

<text>French was an official language of Cambodia for over a century, from the establishment of the French protectorate in the mid-19th century to the start of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1975. Cambodia is the smallest of the three Francophone communities in Southeast Asia, the others being Vietnam and Laos. Out of all Asian Francophone nations, Cambodia is where French has declined the most since the end of the Indochina Wars. Nevertheless, French remains an administrative and cultural language in the country. 
In 2022, French was fluently spoken by a little under half a million people, which is about 3% of the country&#x27;s population, but only by 873 people as a mother tongue according to the country&#x27;s 2008 census.

==History==

The French language was introduced to Cambodia in the mid-19th century after French explorers and merchants made their way from Vietnam into Cambodia. In 1863, Cambodia became a protectorate of France and was incorporated into French Indochina in 1887. Unlike Vietnam, the French initially did not exert much influence on Cambodia and Khmer still remained the medium of education in schools, with French being limited to politicians. 

After the turn of the 20th century, French began to be widely introduced into Cambodian education, initially being limited to the elite class before spreading to the masses nationwide as the economy grew significantly by the 1920s. This was particularly notable in urban areas, where French usage became widespread in business in addition to education and government. The French language&#x27;s growth continued until the Japanese invasion of Cambodia in World War II. Under the Japanese, Khmer was also made a government language alongside French and the two were taught alongside in schools. After the war, French again became the sole official language. When Cambodia became independent in 1953, the French language maintained its official status, now alongside Khmer, and continued to be used in education, government, business, and media.

Despite its strong presence in the government and education, French declined much heavier in Cambodia by the end of the conflicts that embroiled Indochina in the mid-1970s than in Vietnam and Laos. After its victory in the Cambodian Civil War in 1975, the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia and began executing thousands of individuals who were educated or formed part of the professional class before the regime&#x27;s takeover. Members of these groups were overwhelmingly French-speaking, though ironically top Khmer Rouge leaders were often themselves fluent in French or educated in France. By the end of their reign in 1979, French had almost been completely wiped out in Cambodia. Following a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia that overthrew the Khmer Rouge, the transitional State of Cambodia government established in 1989 reintroduced French into the nation&#x27;s government as a secondary language in government and education.

After the establishment of the present government of Cambodia in 1993, French was relegated to administrative language status and Khmer became the sole official language and primary language of education. Beginning in the late 1990s, the English language became more widely taught in Cambodia and French stagnated as English was seen as a more useful international language. Revival of the French language has gained ground much later in Cambodia than in Vietnam and Laos. In 1997, a French-language center opened in Phnom Penh and French-language education began to revive in Cambodia and dozens of Cambodian students study abroad each year in France. A handful of higher education institutes established under the current government use French as a medium of instruction and many schools in urban areas have implemented the language as a medium of instruction either solely or alongside Khmer. Communities of returned refugees from France and Quebec as well as students who have studied in Francophone nations have also added to the French-speaking population of Cambodia.

==Current status==
While French lost its official status under the Khmer Rouge regime, it was reimplemented as an administrative language of Cambodia after the regime&#x27;s downfall. It is a working language alongside the official Khmer in the country&#x27;s judiciary system and in diplomacy. In particular, many law codes remain exclusively written in French and court proceedings may be conducted in the language. French is also a working language in medicine, although political and education officials have expressed concern with the introduction of English usage in a few medical schools that undermine established standards and quality on the country&#x27;s health system by adding an additional language for students.

At the establishment of the current government, French-language education was initially limited to schools and universities built or funded by Francophone governments such as those of France or Canada. However, since the first decade of the 2000s, French language education has grown in other government schools. The language is particularly popular among upper and middle class families in urban areas, in part due to historic and cultural reasons, despite increased compulsory English language education. 

In 2023, the Cambodian government launched an initiative to strengthen and promote French language education in the country to address decreased proficiency among diplomats and due to the strengthening of ties with other Francophone countries. 

==Media==
French-language media is present in Cambodia, though less so than in Vietnam and Laos. The nation boasts a French-language newspaper, &quot;Cambodge Nouveau&quot; (and had another, &quot;Cambodge Soir&quot;, until 2010), as well as French-language television channels.

<doc id="1279719" wikidata="Q8004075" url="?curid=1279719" title="William A. Webb">
<text>William Augustin Webb (1824-1881) was an American sailor and Mexican–American War veteran who resigned his United States Navy commission after more than 20 years of service to join the Confederate States Navy in the American Civil War. Webb was decorated for his service as Captain of the CSS &quot;Teaser&quot;, part of the James River Squadron, during the Battle of Hampton Roads (1862).

In 1863, his orders sent him to Savannah, where he commanded a squadron that included the ironclad CSS &quot;Atlanta&quot;. He was captured in June 1863 and imprisoned in Boston. He was released as part of a prisoner exchange in October 1864 and returned to action on the CSS &quot;Richmond&quot;.

==Early life and career==
William A. Webb grew up in Virginia. He joined the United States Navy at an early age and attained the rank of Midshipman on January 26, 1838. His young wife Elizabeth Ann Webb endured the lonely life of a navy spouse. He was the brother-in-law to another naval officer John Randolph Tucker.

On July 2, 1845, Webb was promoted to Passed Midshipman. He served in the Mexican–American War on the 6-gun storeship USS &quot;Southampton&quot;. Webb departed from Norfolk, Virginia on February 7, 1847, traveling to the Pacific Ocean by way of Cape Horn, eventually reaching Japan in 1854. He was afterwards appointed as Master on October 9, 1853, and Lieutenant on June 12, 1854.

==Civil War==
Webb resigned his commission on May 17, 1861, four months after the Secession, enrolling instead in the Confederate Navy as a First Lieutenant in June. He served at Fernandina, Florida in mid-1861 and then Richmond Station from 1861 to 1862.

===CSS &quot;Teaser&quot; and the Battle of Hampton Roads===

In early 1862, First Lieutenant Webb was made commander of the armed gunboat CSS &quot;Teaser&quot; (or &quot;Teazer&quot;). Prior to the secession it was the property of the Virginia State Navy (then called the York River). The 64 ton, 80 by 18 foot tugboat was armed with a 32 and a 12-pounder rifled cannon. The CSS &quot;Teaser&quot; was part of the James River Squadron, operating on the homonymous river from Norfolk. The squadron&#x27;s chieftain was Flag-Officer Franklin Buchanan, on the ironclad steamer CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; (ex-&quot;Merrimack&quot;). The squadron consisted of 3 steamers (24 guns in all) and 3 supporting gunboats, each with one gun.

On March 8–9, 1862, at the Battle of Hampton Roads, the Confederate flotilla tried to break a blockade maintained by two wooden Union frigates, the USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; and the USS &quot;Congress&quot;. The Union ships were escorted by some gunboats and backed by shore batteries. Buchanan wrote later: &quot;The general order under which the gunboat squadron went into action required that, in the absence of all signals, each commanding officer was to exercise his own judgment and discretion in doing all the damage he could to the enemy and to sink before surrendering.&quot; To support the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; in this action, Capt. John Randolph Tucker, commanding the rest of the James River Squadron, ran past the shore batteries to join the battle, with the CSS &quot;Teaser&quot; &quot;puffing with all the energy of a short-winded tug.&quot; They arrived just as the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; had managed to sink the USS &quot;Cumberland&quot;.

The squadron immediately joined in the battle with the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; against the Union blockade and shore batteries. One eyewitness described the &quot;little &quot;Teaser&quot;... pushed her way in between the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; and &quot;Jamestown&quot;, and advancing close to the shore fired her one gun in face of the battery of sixty guns. Probably her insignificance saved her, for now every shot seemed concentrated upon the [&quot;Virginia&quot;]...&quot; The Confederate squadron now concentrated their fire on the USS &quot;Congress&quot; and forced its surrender. When the Confederate ships charged with accepting the surrender and escorting the captured officers were fired upon by Union shore batteries, Buchanan then ordered another boat to burn her, with Webb&#x27;s &quot;Teaser&quot; as cover. When they were also fired upon, Buchanan then ordered his men to destroy the USS &quot;Congress&quot; using &quot;hot shot and incendiary shell&quot;.

The arrival of the USS &quot;Monitor&quot; on the following day resulted in the &quot;world&#x27;s first battle between ironclads&quot;. Neither the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, nor the USS &quot;Monitor&quot; suffered major damage. However, the Monitor&#x27;s arrival forced the Confederate ships eventually to retreat without having broken the blockade.

Webb was reported later as &quot;slightly wounded&quot; during the battle. Buchanan took pride in his gunboats: &quot;Their judgment in selecting their positions for attacking the enemy was good; their constant fire was destructive, and contributed much to the success of the day.&quot; The Confederate Congress also &quot;thanked&quot; Webb.

===&quot;Special duty&quot;===
During 1862–1863, Webb was stationed at Charleston station for &quot;special duty.&quot; This term was typically used for a secret activity. In this case, Webb was made commander of the &quot;Special Expedition&quot;, a squadron of small boats manned by sixty officers and men, on February 19, 1863. The squadron was stationed behind Fort Sumter in order to stop any Union ships that made it past the obstructions. What made this flotilla unusual, and hence its appellation of &quot;special&quot;, was that the boats were armed with spar torpedoes, a highly controversial weapon of war that some considered &quot;uncivilized&quot;. Webb assembled this squadron with a few cutters and a lot of canoes and skiffs, all armed with 20-foot long poles with a 60-pound torpedo.

The only thing the small flotilla was lacking were steamers and Capt. John Randolph Tucker ordered Webb to contact a local merchant and acquire the steamers &quot;quietly and pleasantly if possible&quot; or seize them, if not.

While present when Admiral Du Pont&#x27;s fleet crossed the Charleston Bar on April 6, 1863, Webb&#x27;s squadron was not called into action that day. Eager to make use of the torpedoes, Tucker, Gen. Beauregard and Webb hatched a plan on April 10 that would &quot;shake Abolitiondom to [its] foundation.&quot; They decided to attack each of the seven Union ironclads by three torpedo boats, but in the several days it took to get the extra boats required, the Union ironclads had left Charleston.

===CSS &quot;Atlanta&quot;===
Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, Flag Officer commanded the southern region of the Confederate States, especially Savannah, Georgia. He was expected to repeat his success commanding the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; in crushing the wooden Union ships in the James River. Tattnall was handicapped in bringing this to fruition because of the blockade. In May 1863, Webb replaced Tatnall as commander of the CSS &quot;Atlanta&quot; ironclad, launched in 1862, and flag officer of the Savannah Squadron, with &quot;the implied condition of his appointment being that he should &#x27;do something&#x27; with her...&quot; Webb proclaimed that &quot;the whole abolition fleet&quot; had &quot;no terror&quot; for him.

Considered by the citizens of Georgia to be the most powerful Confederate warship because of its fast speed of 7 knots, as well as its armament of four Brooke rifles, the &quot;Atlanta&quot; was difficult to maneuver. Special difficulties were caused by its 16-feet draft in the shallow waters surrounding Savannah. Another problem was the scarce airflow of its tight, armored roof, which caused profound heat and humidity. The &quot;Atlanta&quot; suffered profuse leaking. The ship&#x27;s helm was already difficult to steer because it was simply unwieldy: the ship frequently stalled into sand banks along the side of the river. Webb marshaled the CSS &quot;Atlanta&quot;, though, removing the boat of unnecessary comfort - including sanitation and ventilation, as well as fully outfitting it with weaponry. Webb also had to deal with inexperienced sailors, most of whom were recruited from the Confederate Army around the mountainous regions of Georgia. For instance, his pilots arrived just two weeks before the ship engaged in the Battle of Wassaw Sound.

Although beset by problems, Webb was still excited about his prospects. He formulated ambitiously elaborate plans for the CSS &quot;Atlanta&quot;&#x27;s first mission to clear the region of nearby Union forces. Webb was supposed to await reinforcement: the Confederate Congress voted to reinforce his squad with another ship still under construction: the CSS &quot;Savannah&quot; ironclad. Webb, however, waged action in Wassaw Sound against orders on June 17, 1863. He was escorted by two wooden steamers, the CSS &quot;Isondiga&quot; and the CSS &quot;Resolute&quot;. A percussion torpedo was attached to a large, projecting ram.
The Union expected Webb&#x27;s move per intelligence reports and dispatched Captain John Rodgers in the USS &quot;Weehawken&quot;, escorted by the USS &quot;Nahant&quot;. The &quot;Atlanta&quot; suddenly ran aground and swayed at an angle which made it difficult to shoot. The USS &quot;Weehawken&quot; held fire until it was at 300 yards and then pounded the immobile ship, basically turning into target practice for the Union ship. After receiving five of the &quot;Weehawken&quot;&#x27;s 350-pound shots, which knocked a hole in her casemate, crushed the pilot house and port shutter and severely wounded its pilots and several helmsmen, Webb was compelled to surrender immediately. The &quot;battle&quot; lasted only a few minutes, and the &quot;Atlanta&quot; became the first Confederate ironclad to surrender to the Union. He told his crew: &quot;I most earnestly wish that it had happened otherwise, but Providence, for some good reason, has interfered with our plans ...&quot; Meanwhile, the two boats escorting the &quot;Atlanta&quot; scurried upriver for safety. The USS &quot;Nahant&quot; had watched the action without firing a shot.

However, the news stunned the South and Webb faced criticism even after the war from experienced naval officers. He was brave, yes, but lacked good sense. Criticism also fell on Secretary of the Navy, Stephen R. Mallory for his policy of replacing older officers with younger ones and for not firmly opposing Webb in his decision.

The CSS &quot;Atlanta&quot; suffered the sole fatality of the battle, as well as 16 wounded. From 136 to 165 men were taken captive and moved to the ships USS &quot;Cimarron&quot; and USS &quot;Oleander&quot;. These travelled to Fort Lafayette, in New York Harbor, and arrived in late June at Fort Warren on Georges Island in Boston Harbor.

Fort Warren was a relatively modern jail where the prisoners were registered and photographed. However, they were deprived of blankets, food, and clothing. Among the captive sailors, there were 12 deaths due to injuries, as well as death by pneumonia and dysentery, caused by the poor conditions in which they were held. Three healthy crew members escaped. Webb was the first to gain parole, in September 1864, and was later exchanged in October of the same year.

===CSS &quot;Richmond&quot;===

Webb was paroled on September 28, 1864, and exchanged at Cox&#x27;s Wharf, Virginia on October 18, 1864. He was then again fighting on the James River, as Commander of the CSS &quot;Richmond&quot; from October through November 1864. Webb was in command of the &quot;Richmond&quot;, when the James River Squadron, of which Richmond was a member, during a routine patrol of the James River, were surprised on the morning of October 22, 1864, when the Union Army revealed their new battery at Boulware House, two miles from Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. To cover the retreat of the wooden vessels of the fleet, the flagship &quot;Virginia II&quot; approached the battery, followed by the &quot;Richmond&quot; and &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;, and effected the retreat upstream to Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. Though they were caught by surprise, this small action helped determine the effectiveness of the ironclads&#x27; casemates against close rifled fire, and in the case of the &quot;Richmond&quot; the results were favorable: her armor withstood the fire, though her smokestack was shot off.

==Retirement==
William A. Webb subsequently relinquished command of the CSS &quot;Richmond&quot; because of declining health. For this reason, as well as unspecified business matters, he left the Confederacy, in December, 1864, for England. While in London, he took the Oath of Allegiance before Francis A. Adams, the U.S. Consul in that city, on 31 May 1865, and left England the next month, to return home to his native state of Virginia. By mid-1865, after the close of the war, he was already back in Richmond, Virginia, and requested a pardon from President Andrew Johnson, which was approved shortly afterwards.

He died at his home in Goochland County on December 1, 1881.

<text>Carbonaceous refers to something relating to, containing, or composed of carbon. It is a descriptor used for the attribute of any substance rich in carbon. Particularly, &quot;carbonaceous hydrocarbons&quot; are very unsaturated, high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, having an elevated carbon:hydrogen ratio. The carbonaceous chondrites are meteorites that are rich in carbon.

The word &quot;carbonaceous&quot; was first used in 1791.

In geology, metamorphism of a carbonaceous geological material is expressed as a graphitisation process, referring to the graphite generated. Graphitisation may be accelerated or retarded in dependence on various metamorphic or lithological factors involved.

<doc id="1279731" wikidata="Q3104950" url="?curid=1279731" title="Ghost Stations">
<text>Ghost Stations is a series of books by the British military historian Bruce Barrymore Halpenny, containing ostensibly true ghost and mystery stories generally connected to the RAF, airfields and other military or war connected stories.

== History ==

Bruce Halpenny had been writing ghost stories in the 1960s and encountering ghost stories in his exhaustive research into airfield histories, when he decided they should form the subject of a special book, and so started to add to and research his “ghost-mystery” files about abandoned airfields that &quot;murmur and whisper with ghosts&quot;. Halpenny had by 1984 become acknowledged as a respected British military historian, expert in airfield histories, and expert in &quot;RAF ghosts&quot;, especially surrounding airfields.

In the 1960s, Halpenny began presenting what he believed to be evidence of paranormal activity on airfields. He also campaigned for the British government to do their part by preserving a Second World War airfield in its original condition for future generations to see, and for the history of each airfield to be recorded fully and the men and sacrifice never forgotten.

&quot;Ghost Stations&quot; was officially launched at RAF Wittering on Thursday 16 October 1986. The book took 18 months to compile and drew upon the author&#x27;s knowledge and experience working in airfields and documenting their history. &quot;Ghost Stations&quot; proved a best seller and was followed by a second book, entitled, &quot;Aaargh!&quot; that was published with over 30 &quot;ghostly and mysterious&quot; tales, one of which was &quot;The eerie mystery of Lightning 894&quot;. &quot;Aaargh!&quot;, was later to become &quot;Ghost Stations 2&quot; as six more books followed over the years.

&quot;GHOST STATIONS&quot; became a trademark in the late 1980s and in 2008 the new Ghost Stations series, based on the original series, was brought out. In the new series the stories had been shuffled around and merged, thus a story that was being investigated by Bruce Halpenny that was in several books in the old series, were merged into one story in one book in the new series. Also regional books were created in the new series, with &quot;Ghost Stations Lincolnshire&quot;, already for some Lincolnshire bookshops, one of their best sellers. The author&#x27;s son, commercial artist, book editor and writer, Baron Barrymore Halpenny had a hand in the book cover design from the original series to the new series.

The author expresses his beliefs in the supernatural:

<doc id="1279732" wikidata="Q1509829" url="?curid=1279732" title="Impersonal verb">
<text>In linguistics, an impersonal verb is one that has no determinate subject. For example, in the sentence &quot;It rains&quot;, &quot;rain&quot; is an impersonal verb and the pronoun &quot;it&quot; corresponds to an exophoric referrent. In many languages the verb takes a third person singular inflection and often appears with an expletive subject. In the active voice, impersonal verbs can be used to express operation of nature, mental distress, and acts with no reference to the doer. Impersonal verbs are also called weather verbs because they frequently appear in the context of weather description. Also, indefinite pronouns may be called &quot;impersonal&quot;, as they refer to an unknown person, like &quot;one&quot; or &quot;someone&quot;, and there is overlap between the use of the two.

==Valency==
Impersonal verbs appear only in non-finite forms or with third-person inflection. In the third person, the subject is either implied or a dummy referring to people in general. The term &quot;impersonal&quot; simply means that the verb does not change according to grammatical person. In terms of valency, impersonal verbs are often avalent, as they often lack semantic arguments. In the sentence &quot;It rains&quot;, the pronoun &quot;it&quot; is a dummy subject; it is merely a syntactic placeholder—it has no concrete referent. In many other languages, there would be no subject at all. In Spanish, for example, &quot;It is raining&quot; could be expressed as simply &quot;llueve&quot;.

==Use in meteorological expressions==
Temperature expressions (&quot;it is hot&quot;), weather expressions (&quot;it is snowing&quot;), and daylight expressions (&quot;it is dark&quot;) tend to lack independent participants with distinct semantic roles. While snow participates in snowing, very few other types of participants can participate, and the participant is indistinguishable from the event itself; this is similar to the phenomenon of cognate objects. In addition, the participating snow is non-specific, and lacks a clear semantic role. Therefore, assigning the participating snow the role of &#x27;referent&#x27; in the default English expression &quot;it is snowing&quot; would seem inappropriate. Instead, linguistics classify the &quot;is snowing&quot; in &quot;it is snowing&quot; as an impersonal verb.

Meteorological expressions are often constructed with impersonal verbs in English. However, meteorological expressions are obviously not restricted solely to impersonal verbs, even in English; furthermore, different languages use different strategies for their default meteorological expressions and common idioms. In Palestinian Arabic, &quot;Id-dunya ti-shti&quot; translates to &quot;It (the world) is raining&quot; and uses a non-impersonal verb. &quot;Vreme je sunčano&quot;, which means &quot;the weather is sunny&quot;, is a common Serbian construction that uses a (non-impersonal) adverb rather than a verb.

==Forms==

===Invisible arguments===
When an agent is unspecified, impersonal verbs are also known as zero person construction, or impersonal construction. An implicit argument (an argument that is put forth without stating it directly) is present on a semantic level for both Estonian and Finnish. The Finnic impersonal construction enables an event or state to be described without specifying the identity of the agent (actor). Despite this, the interpretation of the impersonal includes a referent of some sort (dummy). The zero person is not entirely the same as an impersonal.

Finnish:
Estonian:
There is a lack of an overt nominative subject in these constructions.

===By-phrase===
Some languages require their counterpart to the English by-phrase be present (like Palauan and Indonesian, Austronesian languages). Other languages disallow the presence of a by-phrase. For example, Polish does not allow the use of a by-phrase in its passive.

The content in the parenthesis causes the Polish sentence to be ungrammatical as who did the knocking cannot be overtly stated. As such, it might seem like it would be more grammatical to use impersonal verbs in such cases.

==Impersonal verbs by language==

In some languages such as English, French, German, Dutch and Swedish, an impersonal verb always takes an impersonal pronoun (&quot;it&quot; in English, &quot;il&quot; in French, &quot;es&quot; in German, &quot;het&quot; in Dutch, &quot;det&quot; in Swedish) as its syntactical subject:

:&quot;It snowed yesterday&quot;. (English)
:&quot;Il a neigé hier&quot;. (French)
:&quot;Es schneite gestern&quot;. (German)
:&quot;Het sneeuwde gisteren&quot;. (Dutch)
:&quot;Det snöade igår&quot;. (Swedish)

Occasionally an impersonal verb will allow an object to appear in apposition to the impersonal subject pronoun:

:&quot;It is raining diamonds.&quot;

Or as an instrumental adjunct:

:&quot;It was pouring with rain.&quot; (British English)

In some other languages (necessarily null subject languages and typically pro-drop languages), such as Portuguese, Spanish, Occitan, Catalan, Italian, Romanian, in Hungarian and all the Slavic languages, an impersonal verb takes no subject at all, but it is conjugated in the third-person singular, which is much as though it had a third-person, singular subject.

:&quot;Nevó ayer.&quot; (Spanish)
:&quot;Nevou ontem.&quot; (Portuguese)
:&quot;Ha nevicato ieri.&quot; (Italian)
:&quot;A nins ieri.&quot; (Romanian)
:&quot;Sniježilo je jučer.&quot; (Croatian)
:&quot;Havazott tegnap.&quot; (Hungarian)
:&quot;Вчера вееше снег. / Včera veeše sneg.&quot; (Macedonian)

Other languages, those which require a subject, may permit an adjunct to assume that role.

:&quot;Unfortunately the next day poured with rain.&quot;

===Indo-European===

====English====
The following sentences illustrate impersonal verbs:

:(1) It rains.
:(2) It is cold.
:(3) It is growing dark.
:(4) It seems that there is no end to this.
:(5) It is unclear why he cut the rope.

The expletive pronoun &quot;it&quot; in these sentences does not denote a clear entity, yet the meaning is clear. In other words, the pronoun &quot;it&quot; has no clear antecedent. English is so strict about requiring a subject that it supplies them for verbs that do not really require them. In sentences (4) and (5), &quot;it&quot; is in the subject position, while the real subject has been moved to the end of the sentence.

A simple test can be done to see if the sentence contains an impersonal verb. One checks to see if a given subject pronoun takes an antecedent in the previous clause or sentence, e.g.

::Bukit Timah is 163.63 metres tall. It is the highest point in Singapore.

::Bukit Timah is 163.63 metres tall. It rains frequently there.
The two examples may seem similar, but only the pronoun &quot;it&quot; in the first example links with the previous subject. The pronoun &quot;it&quot; in the second example, on the other hand, has no referent. The hill (Bukit Timah) does not rain, &quot;it&quot; rains. This demonstrates that &quot;rain&quot; is an impersonal verb.

====Spanish====
There is no equivalent of the dummy subject &quot;it&quot; in Spanish. In Spanish, there are a few true impersonal avalent verbs. Most of them are &quot;atmospheric verbs&quot;:

:&quot;Llueve&quot;
:It&#x27;s raining
:&quot;Ha helado&quot;
:It froze

Most &quot;impersonal&quot; constructions in Spanish involve using a special verb in third-person defective verb with a direct object as its only argument or use of &quot;impersonal se&quot; (not to be confused with other uses of &quot;se&quot;).

There are two main impersonal verbs in Spanish: &quot;haber&quot; (to have, to be (there is/are, there were)) and &quot;hacer&quot; (to do). &quot;Haber&quot; is an irregular verb. When used as an impersonal verb in the present tense, it has a special conjugation for the third person singular (&quot;hay&quot;). Clauses with the verb &quot;haber&quot; do not have an explicit subject; its only argument is a direct object noun phrase that does not agree with the verb. &quot;Haber&quot; has its &#x27;natural meaning&#x27; of &quot;tener&quot; &#x27;to have&#x27;.
:&quot;Hay un libro (aquí).&quot;
:There is a book (here).
:&quot;Hay muchos libros.&quot;
:There are many books.
:&quot;Hubo muchos libros (que no se vendieron).&quot;
:There were many books (that were not sold).

Less frequently, and only in some expressions with a limited number of nouns in singular, the verb &quot;hacer&quot; in the 3rd singular is used as impersonal (&quot;Hacer&quot; is a very common verb meaning &#x27;to do&#x27;).
:&quot;Hace frío.&quot;
:It&#x27;s cold.
:&quot;Hizo frío ayer.&quot;
: It was cold yesterday.
:&quot;Hace viento.&quot;
:It&#x27;s windy.

Spanish will add the pronoun &quot;se&quot; in front of verbs to form general sentences. Impersonal voice using &quot;se&quot; will use a singular verb since &quot;se&quot; can be replaced by &quot;uno&quot;.

:&quot;¿Cómo se escribe &quot;Apple&quot;?&quot;
:How do you spell &quot;Apple&quot;?

The passive voice in Spanish has similar characteristics following that of the impersonal &quot;se&quot;. It is normally formed by using &quot;se&quot; + the third person singular or plural conjugation of a verb, similar to the impersonal &quot;se&quot;. This use of &quot;se&quot; is easily confused with the medial &quot;se&quot;.
:Active voice:
:&quot;Mis amigos comieron torta&quot; (European and American Spanish)
:My friends ate cake (i.e. some of the cake)
:&quot;Mis amigos comieron la torta&quot; (American Spanish, less frequent in European Spanish)
:My friends ate the cake

:Medial meaning:
:&quot;Mis amigos se comieron la torta&quot;
:My friends ate all the cake
:Passive voice:
:Esta torta &quot;se come tradicionalmente en Navidad.&quot;
:This cake is normally eaten during Christmas
:&quot;Se vende esta casa.&quot;
:This house is for sale

====French====

Verbs can be impersonal in French when they do not take a real personal subject as they do not represent any action, occurrence or state-of-being that can be attributed to a person, place or a thing. In French, as in English, these impersonal verbs take on the impersonal pronoun - &quot;il&quot; in French.

:&quot;Il faut que tu fasses tes devoirs.&quot;
:It is necessary that you do your homework.
The &quot;il&quot; is a dummy subject and does not refer to anything in particular in this phrase. The most common impersonal form is &quot;il y a&quot;, meaning &quot;there is&quot;, &quot;there are&quot;. Note its other tenses &quot;(il y avait, il y a eu, il y aura, etc.)&quot;.

French makes a distinction between a dummy subject and an actual subject in clauses with infinitives by the use of a different preposition. The preposition &quot;de&quot; is used with dummy subjects and the preposition &quot;à&quot; is used with real subjects. Compare:

:It&#x27;s important to learn. (= Learning is important.) - dummy subject
:&quot;Il est important d&#x27;apprendre.

:It&#x27;s important to learn. (= This is important to learn.) - real subject
:&quot;Il est important à apprendre.&quot;

====German====

Impersonal verbs are relatively common in German, often in constructions about a state or process. Common examples include &quot;es brennt&quot; (&quot;there is a fire&quot;, literally &quot;it burns&quot;), &quot;es zieht&quot; (&quot;there is a draft&quot;, literally &quot;it draws&quot;) and &quot;es klopft&quot; (&quot;there is a knock at the door&quot;, literally &quot;it knocks&quot;), as well as the whimsical &quot;es weihnachtet sehr&quot; (&quot;it is very Christmassy&quot;, literally &quot;it is Christmas-ing hard&quot;).

Many statements asserting existence also use an impersonal form. Often the equivalent sentences in English start with &quot;there&quot;.

:&quot;Es gibt&quot;
:There is
:&quot;Es kamen&quot;
:There came

====Celtic languages====

The Celtic languages also possess impersonal verbal forms though their use is usually translated into English by forms such as &#x27;one sees&#x27; (Welsh: &quot;gwelir&quot;), &#x27;one did&#x27; (Welsh: &quot;gwnaethpwyd&quot;), &#x27;one is&#x27; (Irish: &quot;táthar&quot;) etc., in which the &#x27;one&#x27; is taken to be an empty subject. For weather, personal verbs are used in Celtic languages, e.g. Welsh &quot;Mae hi&#x27;n bwrw eira&quot; &#x27;it is snowing&#x27;.

Verbs meaning existence may also be impersonal.

:Mae llyfrau.&quot; / Mae llyfr.&quot; (Welsh)
:Tá leabhair ann. &quot;/ Tá leabhar ann.&quot; (Irish)
:There are (some) books. / There is a book.

However, sometimes there are intransitive verbs with more or less the same meaning:

:Mae llyfrau&#x27;n bodoli.&quot; / Mae llyfr yn bodoli.&quot; (Welsh)
:(Some) books exist. / A book exists.

==== Latin ====
Latin has several impersonal verbs, most often seen in the third person singular. The real subject of the sentence will not be in the nominative case but is most often in the dative or accusative case. These verbs include:

* Decet – it becomes/suits; it is right/proper
* Libet – it pleases
* Licet – it is permitted/allowed
* Oportet – it is proper/fitting
* Placet – it is agreed/resolved

===Tai-Kadai===

====Thai====
Impersonal verbs in Thai do not allow for an overt grammatical subject. The impersonal verbs occur only with transitive verbs.

There is no allowance for the presence of a non-referential subject &quot;man&quot; &#x27;it&#x27; in the case frame. In general, it is not allowed in formal speech, such as news reports. However, the presence of non-referential subject &quot;man&quot; can occur in the colloquial form.

Subdivision into non-inception and inception subclasses can occur depending on whether the verb may occur with the path adverb &quot;khin&quot; &#x27;up&#x27;.
===Constructed languages===

In the auxiliary language Interlingua, verbs are not conjugated by person. Impersonal verbs take the pronoun &quot;il&quot;:

:&quot;Il ha nivate heri.&quot;

In the auxiliary language Esperanto, where verbs also are not conjugated for person, impersonal verbs are simply stated with no subject given or implied, even though Esperanto is otherwise &quot;not&quot; a null subject language:

:&quot;Neĝis hieraŭ.&quot;

In the logical language Lojban, impersonal verbs simply have no first argument filled and might not have any arguments filled at all:

:&quot;carvi ca lo prulamdei&quot;

where &quot;carvi&quot; is a verb meaning &quot;x1 rains to x2 from x3&quot; (&quot;x1&quot;, &quot;x2&quot;, and &quot;x3&quot; being core arguments).

==Comparison to other linguistic classifications==

===Weather verb===
Verbs which are used to describe the weather, are often noted to be impersonal verbs in some languages. Some linguists consider the impersonal subject of a weather verb to be a &quot;dummy pronoun&quot;, while others have been critical of this interpretation on the basis of their role as objects in the arguments of verb clauses. In Mandarin Chinese, there are weather verbs which may take no subject or object.

===Impersonal pronoun===
An impersonal pronoun, or dummy pronoun, lacks a reference; in English, the usual example is &quot;it&quot; when used with an impersonal verb. Some sources classify certain uses of &quot;one&quot; (ex. &quot;what should one say?&quot;) or &quot;you&quot; (ex. &quot;you only live once&quot;) as &quot;human impersonal pronouns&quot;. An impersonal pronoun, when used, serves as an empty placeholder, or &quot;dummy subject&quot;, for the sentence.

Examples:
: You would think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
: The young comedian was awful; one felt embarrassed for him.
: If one fails, then one must try harder next time.

When the pronoun &quot;one&quot; is used in the numerical sense (rather than as a dummy pronoun), a different pronoun can be used subsequently to referring to the same entity.
: We watched as one [of the ospreys] dried its feathers in the sun.
: One [driver] pulled her car over to the side.

Generally, it is not ideal to mix the impersonal pronoun one with another pronoun in the same sentence.

: If &quot;one&quot; fails, then he/you must simply try harder.

===Null objects===

While the concept of impersonal verbs is closely related to phenomenon of null subjects, null objects have to do with the lack of the obligatory projection of an object position.

In French
:&quot;C&#x27;est pas lui qui l&#x27;a écrit, son livre, le pape, c&#x27;est quelqu&#x27;un qui lui écrit&quot; __.
:The Pope didn&#x27;t write his book himself, someone writes __ for him.

In English
:Why then do the psychic gifts often seem to tease __, confuse __ and obstruct __?

Null objects can be understood as implicit anaphoric direct objects, that is, those whose referents can be understood from the prior or ongoing discourse context as well as sufficiently salient in that context not only to be encoded pronominally, but even to be entirely omitted. However, it is not imperative that the referent of the direct object has been referred to explicitly previously in the discourse; it could instead be accessible extra-linguistically due to its salience to the interlocutors.

===Defective verb===

An impersonal verb is different from a defective verb in that, with an impersonal verb, only one possible syntactical subject is meaningful (either expressed or not), whereas with a defective verb, certain choices of subject might not be grammatically possible, because the verb does not have a complete conjugation.

==In universal grammar theory==

Impersonal verbs can be considered null subject data. They involve a general concern in generative grammar: determining the nature and distribution of phonetically null but syntactically present entities (empty categories). Since, by definition, these entities are absent from the speech signal, it is of interest that language learners still can come to have information about them. As this phenomenon could not have resulted from sufficient prior experience, it suggests the role of universal grammar.

<doc id="1279733" wikidata="Q7736345" url="?curid=1279733" title="The Ghosts of London">
<text>The Ghosts Of London is a book written by Henry Vollam Morton (&quot;H.V.&quot;), published in 1939 by Methuen &amp; Co Limited in London. Far from being on the subject of ghosts and the supernatural, Morton&#x27;s book is instead a sentimental portrait of historic London juxtaposed with contemporary (1930s) London. The book is made up of 30 short histories and anecdotes, likely collected from his work as a journalist.

Subjects profiled in the book include snuff, herb shops (including a recipe for making Aqua vitae), the London curfew, hansom cabs, lamplighters, Ely Place, the Royal Waxworks, the bells of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Lambeth Palace, Big Ben and Huguenot weavers.

A dozen black-and-white photos appear in the original edition, mostly credited to the London &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.

<doc id="1279739" wikidata="Q573976" url="?curid=1279739" title="Anthony Sampson">
<text>Anthony Terrell Seward Sampson (3 August 1926 – 18 December 2004) was a British writer and journalist. His most notable and successful book was &quot;Anatomy of Britain&quot;, which was published in 1962 and was followed by five more &quot;Anatomies&quot;, updating the original book under various titles. He was the grandson of the linguist John Sampson, of whom he wrote a biography, &quot;The Scholar Gypsy: The Quest For A Family Secret&quot; (1997). He also gave Nelson Mandela advice on Mandela&#x27;s famous 1964 defence speech at the trial which led to his conviction for life.

==Early life and education==
Sampson was born in Billingham, County Durham, and was educated at Westminster School. In 1944 he joined the Royal Navy, and by the time he left, in 1947, he was a sub-lieutenant in the RN Volunteer Reserve. He then studied English at Christ Church, Oxford. 

==Career==
In 1951 Sampson went to Johannesburg, South Africa, to become editor of the magazine &quot;Drum&quot;, remaining there for four years. After his return to the United Kingdom, he joined the editorial staff of &quot;The Observer&quot;, where he worked from 1955 to 1966.

He was the author of a series of books, starting with &quot;Anatomy of Britain&quot; (1962), in which he explored the workings of the British state and other major social institutions, in particular the large corporation. He took an interest in broad political and economic power structures, but he also saw power as personal. He occasionally offered psychoanalytical interpretations of power players, as in this passage from &quot;The Money Lenders&quot;:&quot;[Bankers] seem specially conscious of time, always aware that time is money. There is always a sense of restraint and tension. (Is it part of the connection which Freud observed between compulsive neatness, anal eroticism and interest in money?)&quot;

Sampson was a personal friend of Nelson Mandela before Mandela became politically active. In 1964 Sampson attended the Rivonia Trial in support of Mandela and other ANC leaders, and in 1999 he published the authorised biography of Mandela.

Sampson was also a founding member of the now defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP).

Sampson&#x27;s personal archive, catalogued by the Bodleian Library, was made public for the first time in 2012.

==Personal life==
He married Sally on his return from South Africa. She was a Justice of the Peace and was a bench chairman of the Youth Court at Camberwell, London.

<text>The Kiev Voivodeship (; ; ) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1471 until 1569 and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland from 1569 until 1793, as part of Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. On some maps Kiev Voivodeship was also named as the Lower Volhynia.

The voivodeship was established in 1471 upon the death of the last prince of Kiev Simeon Olelkovich and transformation of the Duchy of Kiev (appanage duchy of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) into the Voivodeship of Kiev.

==Description==
The voivodeship was established in 1471 under the order of King Casimir IV Jagiellon soon after the death of Semen Olelkovich. It had replaced the former Principality of Kiev, ruled by Lithuanian-Ruthenian Olelkovich princes (related to House of Algirdas and Olshansky family).

Its first administrative center was Kiev, but when the city was given to Imperial Russia in 1667 by Treaty of Andrusovo, the capital moved to Zhytomyr (), where it remained until 1793.

It was the biggest voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by land area, covering, among others, the land of Zaporizhian Cossacks.

==Municipal government==
The governor of the voivodeship was voivode (List of voivodes of Kiev). In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the other two major administrative positions were castellan and bishop (biskup kijowski).

<text>Lord Roberts was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba, located in the south-central section of the City of Winnipeg. It was created by redistribution in 1999, and consists primarily of territory taken from the now-defunct ridings of Osborne and Crescentwood. The district is named after Field Marshal Lord Roberts.

Lord Roberts was bordered to the south by Fort Garry and St. Vital, to the west by River Heights, to the north by Fort Rouge and St. Boniface and to the east by St. Vital.

Lord Roberts&#x27; population in 1996 was 20,469. The average family income in 1999 was $44,963, with an unemployment rate of 7.70%. Thirty-one per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low income. Over 47% of the riding&#x27;s dwelling houses in 1999 were rental units, and over 20% of the riding&#x27;s families were single-parent.

Over 19% of the riding&#x27;s population was above 65 years of age. 14% per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents were immigrants, including 5% German and 4% Ukrainian. Four percent of the riding&#x27;s residents were Jewish.

The service sector accounts for 19% of Lord Roberts&#x27;s industry, followed by 13% in health and social services.

The riding was only ever held by the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), and was generally considered safe for the party. Its only MLA was Diane McGifford, who was re-elected in 2003 with over 60% of the riding&#x27;s popular vote.

For the 2011 election, the riding was dissolved into Fort Rouge, River Heights, and the new riding of Fort Garry-Riverview

<doc id="1279749" wikidata="Q1918932" url="?curid=1279749" title="Melancton Smith">
<text>Melancton Smith (May 7, 1744 – July 29, 1798) was a merchant, lawyer and a New York delegate to the Continental Congress. Praised for his intelligence, liberality, and reasonableness, Smith had attained considerable respect in the State of New York by 1787 and he has been described by modern scholars as the most important Anti-Federalist theorist and spokesman. Additionally, Smith played an active and central role in the ratification of the United States Constitution.

==Biography==
Melancton Smith was born in Jamaica, Long Island, New York, and was homeschooled by his parents. When his family moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, he became involved in the mercantile business. Smith manifested a life-long interest in metaphysics and religion, and in 1769 he helped organize the Washington Hollow Presbyterian Church and purchased one of its pews.

===Career in New York===
He became a delegate to the first New York Provincial Congress in New York on May 22, 1775. He served in the Continental Line Regiment on June 30, 1775, which he organized as the Dutchess County Rangers. On Feb. 11, 1777, he became one of three members of a Dutchess County commission for &quot;inquiring into, detecting and defeating all conspiracies ... against the liberties of America;&quot; he served for the next six months administering oaths of allegiance, arresting suspects, informing upon and examining Loyalists. While wielding this powerful civil and military authority, he was also serving as sheriff of Dutchess County. He extended his land holdings by purchasing some of the forfeited Loyalist estates. In May 1777 was appointed Sheriff of Dutchess County, an office he retained until 1781. In the following year, the Provincial Commission selected Smith to be the Second Judge on the Court of Common Pleas. He was also elected to be the Justice of the Peace in Dutchess County and held both positions until 1784, when he and his family moved to New York City.

===US Constitution===
Smith moved to New York City in 1784 where he became a prominent merchant. He helped found the New York Manumission Society in opposition to slavery and served in the Continental Congress from 1785 to 1787. He played an active role in the writing of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

Smith was the most important Anti-Federalist member of the State gratification convention at Poughkeepsie in 1788, where he made many of the same arguments as the Federal Farmer, bore the brunt of the Federalist attack and got into heated debates with Alexander Hamilton. Smith was so successful in opposing even Hamilton that he had been characterized as &quot;one of the ablest debaters in the country&quot;. Following the ratification of the Constitution by New Hampshire and Virginia, and a letter he received from Nathan Dane, Smith became convinced that New York had no choice but to accept the ratification of the Constitution and could not afford to wait until it had been amended because of external threats. His vote for the Constitution, albeit with the recommendation of amendments, broke Anti-Federalist ranks and brought down Governor George Clinton&#x27;s wrath.

He was one of the few important landowners and merchants among the Anti-Federalists, and Smith continued in the Clintonian party. He was elected to the Assembly in 1791 and canvassed the state for Clinton in 1792 against John Jay. Smith died during the yellow fever epidemic in New York City in 1798 and is buried in Jamaica Cemetery, Jamaica, Queens, New York. The homonymous Unionist naval officer Melancton Smith was his grandson.

==Anti-Federalist Papers==
Smith has been cited as the likely author of some of the more prominent Anti-Federalist essays written to encourage voters to reject ratification of the Constitution: the essays of Brutus and The Federal Farmer. While many believed Robert Yates to have been the author of the Brutus essays and Richard Henry Lee to have written the Federal Farmer, scholars have recently cast doubt on those attributions. In a computational analysis of the known writings of Smith, Yates, Lee, and other prominent Antifederalists, John Burrows concluded that Smith was the most likely author of both sets of essays. He found that &quot;Brutus is consistently unlike... Yates&#x27;s other writings.&quot; However, &quot;the resemblance to Smith is strong and unfaltering.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;[a]ll of the tests employed upheld Smith&#x27;s authorship of Federal Farmer&#x27;s papers, while the claim for Richard Henry Lee found no support at all.&quot; Michael Zuckert and Derek Webb, noting that it would be odd for one person to write two separate sets of essays covering similar topics and publishing at the same time, suggest that Smith instead collaborated closely with other Antifederalists. They find it more probable that he wrote one of the sets of essays, while another person or persons close to him wrote the other.

<doc id="1279756" wikidata="Q842809" url="?curid=1279756" title="Bond order">
<text>In chemistry, bond order is a formal measure of the multiplicity of a covalent bond between two atoms. As introduced by Gerhard Herzberg, building off of work by R. S. Mulliken and Friedrich Hund, bond order is defined as the difference between the numbers of electron pairs in bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.

Bond order gives a rough indication of the stability of a bond. Isoelectronic species have the same bond order.

==Examples==

The bond order itself is the number of electron pairs (covalent bonds) between two atoms. For example, in diatomic nitrogen N≡N, the bond order between the two nitrogen atoms is 3 (triple bond). In acetylene H–C≡C–H, the bond order between the two carbon atoms is also 3, and the C–H bond order is 1 (single bond). In carbon monoxide, , the bond order between carbon and oxygen is 3. In thiazyl trifluoride , the bond order between sulfur and nitrogen is 3, and between sulfur and fluorine is 1. In diatomic oxygen O=O the bond order is 2 (double bond). In ethylene the bond order between the two carbon atoms is also 2. The bond order between carbon and oxygen in carbon dioxide O=C=O is also 2. In phosgene , the bond order between carbon and oxygen is 2, and between carbon and chlorine is 1.

In some molecules, bond orders can be 4 (quadruple bond), 5 (quintuple bond) or even 6 (sextuple bond). For example, potassium octachlorodimolybdate salt () contains the anion, in which the two Mo atoms are linked to each other by a bond with order of 4. Each Mo atom is linked to four  ligands by a bond with order of 1. The compound (terphenyl)–CrCr–(terphenyl) contains two chromium atoms linked to each other by a bond with order of 5, and each chromium atom is linked to one terphenyl ligand by a single bond. A bond of order 6 is detected in ditungsten molecules , which exist only in a gaseous phase.

===Non-integer bond orders===

In molecules which have resonance or nonclassical bonding, bond order may not be an integer. In benzene, the delocalized molecular orbitals contain 6 pi electrons over six carbons, essentially yielding half a pi bond together with the sigma bond for each pair of carbon atoms, giving a calculated bond order of 1.5 (one and a half bond). Furthermore, bond orders of 1.1 (eleven tenths bond), 4/3 (or 1.333333..., four thirds bond) or 0.5 (half bond), for example, can occur in some molecules and essentially refer to bond strength relative to bonds with order 1. In the nitrate anion (), the bond order for each bond between nitrogen and oxygen is 4/3 (or 1.333333...). Bonding in dihydrogen cation can be described as a covalent one-electron bond, thus the bonding between the two hydrogen atoms has bond order of 0.5.

==Bond order in molecular orbital theory==

In molecular orbital theory, bond order is defined as half the difference between the number of bonding electrons and the number of antibonding electrons as per the equation below. This often but not always yields similar results for bonds near their equilibrium lengths, but it does not work for stretched bonds. Bond order is also an index of bond strength and is also used extensively in valence bond theory.

:&quot;bond order&quot; = 

Generally, the higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. Bond orders of one-half may be stable, as shown by the stability of (bond length 106 pm, bond energy 269 kJ/mol) and (bond length 108 pm, bond energy 251 kJ/mol).

Hückel molecular orbital theory offers another approach for defining bond orders based on molecular orbital coefficients, for planar molecules with delocalized π bonding. The theory divides bonding into a sigma framework and a pi system. The π-bond order between atoms &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; derived from Hückel theory was defined by Charles Coulson by using the orbital coefficients of the Hückel MOs:

:formula_1,

Here the sum extends over π molecular orbitals only, and &quot;ni&quot; is the number of electrons occupying orbital &quot;i&quot; with coefficients &quot;cri&quot; and &quot;csi&quot; on atoms &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; respectively. Assuming a bond order contribution of 1 from the sigma component this gives a total bond order (σ + π) of 5/3 = 1.67 for benzene, rather than the commonly cited bond order of 1.5, showing some degree of ambiguity in how the concept of bond order is defined.

For more elaborate forms of molecular orbital theory involving larger basis sets, still other definitions have been proposed. A standard quantum mechanical definition for bond order has been debated for a long time. A comprehensive method to compute bond orders from quantum chemistry calculations was published in 2017.

==Other definitions==
The bond order concept is used in molecular dynamics and bond order potentials. The magnitude of the bond order is associated with the bond length. According to Linus Pauling in 1947, the bond order between atoms &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; is experimentally described as

:formula_2

where &quot;d&quot;1 is the single bond length, &quot;dij&quot; is the bond length experimentally measured, and &quot;b&quot; is a constant, depending on the atoms. Pauling suggested a value of 0.353 Å for &quot;b&quot;, for carbon-carbon bonds in the original equation:

:formula_3

The value of the constant &quot;b&quot; depends on the atoms. This definition of bond order is somewhat &quot;ad hoc&quot; and only easy to apply for diatomic molecules.

<doc id="1279759" wikidata="Q257271" url="?curid=1279759" title="Loretta Devine">
<text>Loretta Devine (born August 21, 1949) is an American actress. She is known for numerous roles across stage and screen. Her most high profile roles include Lorrell Robinson in the original (1981) Broadway production of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, Gloria Matthews in the film &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; (1995), and her recurring role as Adele Webber on the medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Devine also played Juanita Sims in the film adaptation of &quot;For Colored Girls&quot; (2010).

== Early life ==
Loretta Devine was born in Houston, Texas, on August 21, 1949. She grew up in the Acres Homes area of Houston, where her mother was a single mother to six children. She was very active on the pep squad, and performed in talent shows at George Washington Carver High School.

In 1971, Devine graduated from the University of Houston with a Bachelor of Arts in Speech and Drama. In 1976, she received a Master of Fine Arts in Theater from Brandeis University.

== Career ==
=== Stage work ===
Devine has worked extensively on Broadway. Her Broadway debut was in 1978 in a musical called &quot;A Broadway Musical&quot;, which closed after 14 previews and only one performance on December 21, 1978. She captured attention in her second Broadway show, called &quot;Comin&#x27; Uptown,&quot; which featured Gregory Hines.

She rose to stardom in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, a smash 1983 Broadway musical loosely based on the history of The Supremes, in which she originated the role of Lorrell Robinson (a fictional character based on Mary Wilson). The story of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; was created during workshops that were carried out in six-week workshops over the period of three years, which Devine, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Jennifer Holliday developed via improv. She also received raves in the 1995 Apollo revival of &quot;The Wiz&quot; as Glinda the Good Witch of the South. In May 2024, she starred in &quot;The Preacher’s Wife&quot;, a musical that began its run in Atlanta at The Alliance Theatre and is based on the previous films.

=== Film ===
While rehearsing for &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; with a little girl in 1981, Devine was cast in Jessie Maple&#x27;s &quot;Will&quot;, the first independent feature-length film directed by an African-American woman. For her featured role in the low-budget film, Devine earned $500.

Minor roles for Devine followed in films such as &quot;Little Nikita&quot; and &quot;Stanley &amp; Iris&quot;.

In 1995, she landed a major role as Gloria Matthews in &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, opposite Whitney Houston, Gregory Hines, and Angela Bassett. The role earned her an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, as did her next film, &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;, her second film with Houston and Hines. She later co-starred opposite Alfre Woodard in &quot;Down in the Delta&quot; (1998) and &quot;Funny Valentines&quot; (1999).

She has a cameo performance in the film version of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;.

=== Television and continued film successes ===
Devine played roles as a repertory character in the play &quot;The Colored Museum&quot; with Vickilyn Reynolds. Devine and Reynolds both went on to play sisters in the short-lived TV series &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;. During the period between the play and the series, Devine appeared in the first season of the TV series &quot;A Different World&quot; as Stevie Rallen, a dormitory director at the fictional Hillman College.

From 2000 to 2004, Devine starred as high school teacher Marla Hendricks on the Fox drama series &quot;Boston Public&quot;. Devine won three more Image Awards for her work in the series. She also continued to work in film, playing prominent roles in &quot;Urban Legend&quot;, &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot;, and &quot;I Am Sam&quot;. Devine earned yet another Image Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her work in the 2004 film &quot;Woman Thou Art Loosed&quot;. She also appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Crash&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in &quot;This Christmas&quot;, and in the next year had a series regular role on the ABC comedy-drama &quot;Eli Stone&quot;. Devine also was part of the ensemble casts of two Tyler Perry-directed films &quot;For Colored Girls&quot; and &quot;Madea&#x27;s Big Happy Family&quot;. In 2008, she was featured prominently on George Michael&#x27;s remake of the song &quot;Feeling Good.&quot; She also appeared in &quot;First Sunday&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot; and &quot;Jumping the Broom&quot;.

Devine had a recurring role in the Shonda Rhimes drama series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; as Dr. Richard Webber&#x27;s first wife, Adele. In 2011 she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance. She was nominated for a second time for her performance in 2012. Devine also won Gracie Allen Award for Outstanding Female Actor in a Feature Role for &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in 2012.

In 2011, she also starred on the short-lived ABC Family comedy &quot;State of Georgia&quot;. In 2012, she was part of &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot; cast. She also voiced the character Hallie, on the Disney Junior series &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;. Later that year she began starring in the Lifetime series &quot;The Client List&quot;, playing the role of Georgia Cummings, the owner of the massage parlor where the lead character Riley Parks works. The series was canceled after two seasons. Devine also played Cynthia Carmichael on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Carmichael Show&quot;. Devine starred on the Netflix series, &quot;Family Reunion&quot;, with Richard Roundtree and Tia Mowry-Hardrict.

<text>The , which is Japanese for &quot;falcon-people&quot;, were a people of ancient Japan who lived in the Satsuma and Ōsumi regions of southern Kyushu during the Nara period. They frequently resisted Yamato rule. After their subjugation they became subjects of the government under Ritsuryō, and the Ministry of the Military had an office known as the in charge of their governance. The name also came into use by samurai as a title, . In modern times, Hayato is a Japanese male given name.

== History and culture ==
The Hayato might have been the same as the Kumaso group of around the same time, but while the Kumaso are mentioned in the more legendary portions of the Nihon Shoki, the Hayato are recorded in various historical texts until the beginning of the Heian period. Though the Kumaso are generally portrayed as rebellious, the Hayato are listed among the attendants of emperors and princes from as early as Emperor Nintoku&#x27;s reign. This, along with a mention of Hayato crying before the grave of Emperor Yūryaku after his death, suggests that the Hayato were naturalized as personal servants by the late 7th century.

Even after pledging allegiance to the Japanese court, the Hayato continued to resist its rule. After the establishment of Ōsumi Province in 713, the Ōsumi Hayato fought back in 720 with the Hayato Rebellion, but were defeated in 721 by an army led by Ōtomo no Tabito. The Handen-Shūju system was implemented in their lands in 800. The population of Yamato immigrants in Kagoshima Prefecture in the early 8th century has been estimated at around 9,000 people and one-seventh of the total population. By this estimate, the Hayato population of the time can be calculated as consisting of around 54,000 people (not including Hayato emigrants to Honshū).

The Hayato were made to emigrate to the Kinai region, and were active in the protection of the court, the arts, sumo, and bamboo work. Many lived in Yamashiro Province, in the south of modern Kyoto. There remains an area called in Kyōtanabe, Kyoto, where many Ōsumi Hayato lived. These were the Hayato governed by the &quot;Hayato-shi&quot;.

The language spoken by the Hayato is not known, except for two words and several personal names documented in contemporary sources. In the Ōsumi Fudoki, an ancient Japanese text from the 8th century, two words from the Hayato language can be found: &quot;kusera&quot; (Man&#x27;yōgana: 久西良) and &quot;pisi&quot; (Man&#x27;yōgana: 必志). &quot;Kusera&quot; probably means &quot;comb&quot;. Although the meaning &quot;head hair&quot; was suggested as well, the gloss 髪梳 ‘head.hair comb’ in the Ōsumi Fudoki strongly suggests the first meaning. The comparison with Western Old Japanese &quot;kusi&quot; (modern Japanese &quot;kushi&quot; 櫛) and Reconstructed Ryukyuan &quot;*kusi&quot; suggests borrowing from local Kyushu Old Japanese, as indicated by the diminutive suffix &quot;-ra&quot;. The second word, &quot;pisi&quot; (shoal) is probably a native Hayato word. It suggests a common origin with adjacent languages for this word when compared with Reconstructed Ryukyuan &quot;*pisi&quot;, Ainu &quot;pis&quot; (&quot;shore&quot;), and Eastern Old Japanese &quot;pîⁿzi³&quot;. Despite efforts by some scholars, such as Kakubayashi in 1998, to associate these words with the Austronesian language family, the dominant perspective holds that the Hayato language was related to Japonic languages. Nonetheless, it is thought to have diverged early from the languages spoken on the islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu. 

Their culture is also believed to have been unique from those of other regions of Japan. In particular, their folk song and dance became famous in the Kinai region as the . An excavation of Heijō Palace discovered wooden shields with a distinctive reverse-S-shaped marking. These shields match those described in the &quot;Engishiki&quot;, which the Hayato used in court ceremonial functions. The Hayato had roles in various state ceremonies, including those for the new year, imperial enthronement, and visiting foreign officials.

According to the ancient records of Hizen province, the Gotō Islands were also inhabited by a people resembling the Hayato. The New Book of Tang describes a minor king of , and this Haya has also been interpreted as referring to the Hayato.

There are three types of graves archaeologically associated with the Hayato: the widely distributed around the border of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, the of the southern Satsuma peninsula, and the found north of the Satsuma peninsula. Another large group of tunnel tombs is located near the Ōsumi area of Kyotanabe. Because of the proximity and because the gravelly soil of the area is not suited to such tombs, these may also be associated with the Hayato.

In Japanese mythology, the deity Umisachihiko is considered the ancestor of the ruler of the Ata Hayato. The Hayato Dance may be intended to portray Umisachihiko&#x27;s pain at being outdone by his younger brother Yamasachihiko.

== Regional distribution ==
;, or Satsuma Hayato
:A Hayato tribe who lived on the Satsuma Peninsula. Before the establishment of Satsuma Province, the area was known as Ata. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;&#x27;s section on 682 calls them the Ata Hayato, while the section of the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; on the year 709 refers to them as the Satsuma Hayato.
:A Hayato tribe who lived in the northern Ōsumi Peninsula, or by another theory the Kimotsuki plain region. They are mentioned in &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; article on 682.
:A Hayato tribe who lived in Tane Province. In 702, the court dispatched an army and conquered the region.
:A Hayato tribe who lived on the Koshikijima Islands. They are mentioned in the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;&#x27;s section on 769.
:A Hayato tribe who lived in Hyūga Province. The &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; records that in 710, their leader submitted to the court and was awarded the rank of . However, this was before the separation of Ōsumi province from Hyūga Province in 713. The history of Usa Shrine records that later, in 719, the Ōsumi and Hyūga Hayato attacked Japan, perhaps a precursor to the rebellion of 720.

== Skeletal findings ==
Anthropological research on human skeletons of the Kofun period on southern Kyushu has shown that male skeletons found inland differ from those on the Miyazaki plain. Inland skeletons resembled those of Jōmon people and northwestern Kyushu Yayoi people, and some groups on the plain also resembled northern Kyushu Yayoi people. Additionally, skeletons excavated from late Yayoi-period ruins on Tanegashima are smaller than those found on Kyushu, and show signs of artificial cranial deformation.

<doc id="1279775" wikidata="Q4818600" url="?curid=1279775" title="Attorney-General (New Zealand)">
<text>The Attorney-General () is a political and legal officer in New Zealand. The Attorney-General is simultaneously a ministerial position and the chief law officer of the Crown, and has responsibility for supervising New Zealand law and advising the government on legal matters. The Attorney-General serves both a political and apolitical function. The current Attorney-General is Judith Collins.

==Responsibilities and powers==
The Attorney-General has two main areas of official responsibility. One, the Attorney-General has ministerial jurisdiction over the Crown Law Office and the Parliamentary Counsel Office. They also had responsibility for the Serious Fraud Office from its founding in 1990 until 2008, when it was transferred to the Minister of Police. Two, the Attorney-General is the principal law officer of the Crown, responsible for supervising the state&#x27;s administration of the law and for providing legal advice to the government. This includes upholding the rule of law and advising on compliance with domestic and international obligations. In the latter role (but strictly not in the former), the Attorney-General is assisted by the Solicitor-General, a non-partisan official. This reduces the extent to which the Attorney-General&#x27;s actions on behalf of the state (as opposed to the government) can be influenced by their political allegiance.

A more complete description of the Attorney-General&#x27;s powers can be found in the briefings to the incoming Attorney-General prepared by the Crown Law Office (most recently in 2020).

At present, there is no statutory basis which establishes the office of Attorney-General, although the position is referenced by a number of other legal documents, such as the Constitution Act 1986 which allows the Solicitor-General to exercise the functions of the Attorney-General. The functions of the Attorney-General are also described in the Cabinet Manual.

There is no constitutional duty on the government to follow the advice of the law officers. The Cabinet Manual outlines the process by which the legal advice provided by the Attorney-General (and others) may be disclosed.

The Attorney-General is also responsible for advising the Governor-General on who should be appointed judges of the courts of New Zealand.

==History==
The post of Attorney-General has existed since the separation of New Zealand as a distinct Crown Colony from New South Wales. It is a distinct position from that of Minister of Justice, although the two posts are sometimes held by the same person, for example, Martyn Finlay held both positions from 1972 to 1975.

Historically, the post could be held either by a politician or by a senior jurist, but today, it is invariably held by a member of Parliament. The Attorney-General is a member of the Executive Council and is usually appointed as a member of the Cabinet. (An exception is when David Lange was appointed Attorney-General outside Cabinet from 1989 to 1990.)

By tradition, persons appointed Attorney-General have been lawyers. Only two attorneys-general have not been lawyers, Prime Minister George Forbes who held the post from 1933 until 1935 and most recently Michael Cullen who held the post in 2005 and again from 2006 to 2008. In November 1906, when Albert Pitt died, there was no lawyer in the governing Liberal Party who was free take up the position. Hence Joseph Ward appointed John Findlay to the Legislative Council on 23 November 1906 and appointed him Attorney-General and Colonial Secretary on the same day.

The table below is an incomplete listing of New Zealand politicians who have held political appointment as Attorney-General since 1856. It does not show non-political attorneys-general. There were two previous attorneys-general before responsible government was introduced in New Zealand in 1856: Francis Fisher who held office for less than one year in 1841, and William Swainson who held office until 7 May 1856. Peter Wilkinson was the half-brother of his successor, Jim McLay.

<text>The Rodovia Anchieta (Anchieta Highway, official designation SP-150) is a highway connection between São Paulo and the Atlantic coast, the cities of Cubatão and Santos, in Brazil. In the plateau, the highway serves several cities of Greater São Paulo, such as São Bernardo do Campo, São Caetano do Sul, Santo André and Riacho Grande and traverses a picturesque region of dams and rain forests.

The Rodovia Anchieta is a major pride of the Brazilian engineering, because it was built with a great number of bridges and tunnels along the steep cliffs of the Serra do Mar; and the first modern, concrete-paved road built in São Paulo in the 1930s. Its north lane was inaugurated on Tuesday, 22 April 1947, and its south on Thursday, 9 July 1953.

The highway is one of the busiest of the country, because of the movement of goods to and from Santos&#x27;s seaport. Traffic problems are common, mainly if there is bad weather or in long weekends when many families living in São Paulo go to Santos or Guarujá beaches. The Rodovia Anchieta is approximately 60 km long.

It is named after the Jesuit priest, Father José de Anchieta, who often called the trail &quot;the worst trail in the world&quot; it was given this nickname because it badly hurt his feet when he would walk the trail. It connected to the city of São Vicente by the sea with the village he helped to found in the high plateau, São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, in 1554.

The highway is managed by a state concession to the private company Ecovias, and therefore is a toll road.

The two carriageways of the Rodovia Anchieta are both fully reversible. Traffic is managed to flow either bidirectionally (uphill on one carriageway and downhill on the other) or unidirectionally (uphill or downhill on both carriageways), depending on demand. In the unidirectional mode, the opposing traffic is diverted to the Rodovia dos Imigrantes.

<text>Baijiu (), or shaojiu (), is a colorless Chinese liquor typically coming in between 35% and 60% alcohol by volume (ABV). Each type of baijiu uses its own type of &quot;qū&quot; for fermentation to create a distinct and characteristic flavor profile.

Baijiu is a clear liquid usually distilled from fermented sorghum, although other grains may be used; some southeastern Chinese styles may employ rice and glutinous rice while other Chinese varieties may use wheat, barley, millet, or Job&#x27;s tears () in their mash bills. The &quot;qū&quot; starter culture used in the production of &quot;baijiu&quot; is usually made from pulverized wheat grain or steamed rice.

Because of its clarity, &quot;baijiu&quot; can appear similar to several other East Asian liquors, e.g. Japanese &quot;shōchū&quot; (25%) or Korean &quot;soju&quot; (20–45%), but it often has a significantly higher alcohol content (35–60%).

==History==

No exact dates are known for the invention of the modern form of baijiu as it emerged gradually with the historical development of distillery technology.

* Prototypical alcohol making in China dates back to as early as the Neolithic Age with archaeological discoveries of alcoholic beverage containers belonging to that period. 
* A systematic distillery process was likely developed during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) with archeological finds of brick arts depicting distilling scenes.
* The first proto-baijiu was likely made during the Tang dynasty (618–907) as the drink was described by poets Bai Juyi (白居易) and Yong Tao (雍陶) at the time. 
* The flourishing of Song dynasty (960–1279) commerce and urbanization likely popularized alcohol consumption with a boom of &quot;Jiuguan&quot; (酒馆, &#x27;pub, bar&#x27;) in major cities. 
* By this time the proto-baijiu was likely to be only about 15% ABV as literature from the time recorded &quot;bowls of alcohol consumed&quot; suggesting that it must have been weaker than the modern form baijiu. 
* During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Middle Eastern distillery technology spread to China, which probably improved the existing distillery techniques, allowing for higher-degree distilled alcohol to be possible. 
* The distillation technology matured as baijiu began to resemble its modern form around the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Detailed description of Baijiu was recorded in &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; (本草纲目, Compendium of Materia Medica) by Li Shizhen. 
* Baijiu continued to evolve with the refinements of baijiu making techniques over the centuries until today.

Baijiu is characterized by solid-state fermentation and distillation using a grain culture called &quot;qū&quot;, which allows for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. This is a typical feature of liquors produced in East Asia. Chinese &quot;baijiu&quot; is always distilled from grain, produced in batches and blended.

==Image==

Outside of East Asia, baijiu is widely regarded as an acquired taste. In response to one 2015 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, third-party commenters compared baijiu&#x27;s aroma and taste profile to &quot;jet fuel, kerosene, poison, nail polish remover, drain cleaner, Burgundy cheeses, and salty garbage water&quot;, and the tenor of these remarks was &quot;representative of most English-language writing about baijiu at the time&quot;. Such harsh critiques have been disputed by Western experts on baijiu, who believe Westerners are shocked and repulsed by baijiu&#x27;s unexpectedly intense flavor because they expect a clear liquor to have a mild flavor similar to vodka. These experts prefer to compare baijiu to Western liquors with strong flavors and aromas, such as peaty whisky, Scotch whisky, grappa, or tequila. Additionally, some believe these negative judgments are reflective of broader Western attitudes toward Chinese cuisine. They argue the opinions of the hundreds of millions of people who enjoy baijiu should be given as much weight as the opinions of foreign critics.

==Serving==

=== Traditional etiquette ===
The Chinese traditionally serve &quot;baijiu&quot; neat at room temperature, in small cups or glasses, though drinkware varies by region. It is traditional to drink &quot;baijiu&quot; with food rather than on its own, though it is often infused with fruit or medicinal herbs and spices.

The ceremonial includes the following steps:

# Execute the &quot;Baili&quot; (拜礼) greeting to show respect to the host.
# Spill a moderate amount of baijiu in the cup onto the ground to show gratitude to nature.
# Take a sip and taste the baijiu, and tell the host your opinion.
# Finish the baijiu in the small glass in one go after the &quot;Ganbei&quot; (干杯, &#x27;Cheers&#x27;) and clinking of glasses.

Note that the host should initiate and invite for a cup, and the guest should reply with a cup.

=== Modern etiquette ===
In modern days, ceremonial parts of the etiquettes are ignored. Commonly with a group of friends or family, the host would initiate with &quot;Cheers for...!&quot; (为...干杯!), and then guests would finish their cups after clinking the glasses. Tasting is also appreciated.

In 2007, a report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine mentioned integrating baijiu into cocktails, and in the years since several bars around the world have added baijiu to their cocktail programs.

=== Baijiu and Chinese business culture ===
Chinese business culture is known to be intense. It is believed that one&#x27;s true self is shown when intoxicated. Therefore, when negotiating a business partnership, there is a tradition of serving high-degree Baijiu on the dinner table, in order to judge one&#x27;s trustworthiness. There are also folk beliefs, especially in rural China, that consuming alcohol excessively equates to manliness and that one should not reject a serving offered by an elderly or higher-up. Many inexperienced Chinese drinkers are persuaded to overdrink on such occasions. These experiences are commonly referred to as the reason for Baijiu&#x27;s unpopularity among some. This negative association of Baijiu with extreme drinking culture can sometimes lead to fear of Baijiu in the younger generation or people who have yet to try the drink.

==Pricing and the baijiu market==

Although most baijiu are priced similarly to other liquors with similar alcohol percentage, some high-end baijiu can be highly collectible due to the intricate skills and traditional artisanship involved in the making of baijiu, the age of the baijiu, or the rarity of the bottle etc. With the gifting tradition in some areas of China, sometimes expensive baijiu could also be gifted instead of being consumed. There is a sizable market for high-end baijiu collection for the above reasons. For example, the highest grade of Wuliangye retails for (US$3,375). Top-tier baijiu are likely to be from traditional baijiu distillery such as Kweichow Maotai, Wuliangye, Luzhou Laojiao, Shuijing Fang etc.

On the opposite side of the spectrum. Low-end &quot;baijiu&quot; can be as inexpensive as a can of beer per volume. For example, Erguotou and Jiang Xiaobai. Although some deride the low ends for their taste, they are more casually consumed with meals, or just when drinkers want to simply get drunk.

=== Global baijiu market ===
&quot;Baijiu&quot; is the world&#x27;s bestselling liquor, with sold as of 2016, and 10.8 billion liters sold in 2018, more than whisky, vodka, gin, rum and tequila combined. As well as the most consumed liquor, with 1.2 billion nine-liter cases consumed in 2018, mostly in China – three times the global consumption of vodka. Outside of China it is gaining popularity, as seen with the sale of Ming River Baijiu in US and EU markets from late 2010s, a strong-aroma (nongxiang) type baijiu sourced from the Luzhou Laojiao distillery.

=== International production ===
In 2013 and 2014 an American company, Byejoe, based out of Houston, Texas won a number of awards for their Baijiu product. Byejoe used imported baijiu and distilled it in South Carolina.
In 2019, Australian sorghum exported to China accounted for approximately 78.3 percent of Australia&#x27;s total sorghum export market, which was valued at 29.9 million U.S. dollars. Exports of Australian sorghum to China are largely driven by demand for baijiu manufacture.

==Classification==
=== By aroma profile ===
Throughout the evolutionary history of baijiu, numerous regional variations in alcohol production technique across the country have been incorporated into baijiu making. The practice of infusing alcohol with herbs, spices, fruits and other ingredients has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine, but is also done purely for flavor. The practice of infusing spirits is a common practice.
Baijiu has a distinctive smell and taste that is highly valued in Chinese culinary culture, and connoisseurs focus especially on its fragrance. This classification system began in 1952 and was updated in August 1979 at the third nationwide baijiu competition held in Dalian. Even so, during the competition, experts rated various baijiu based on their taste rather than aroma.

There are 4 major categories of baijiu based on aroma profile:

# Qingxiang (, &quot;qīngxiāng; light aroma, &quot;Q-&quot; is pronounced akin to &quot;Ch-&quot;&quot;): 
#* Delicate, dry, and light, with a smooth and light mouthfeel.
#* The flavors of this distilled liquor is contributed primarily by ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, and succinic acid and give the spirit a taste of dried fruit with floral notes. 
#* It is made from sorghum fermented in a stone vessel with &quot;qu&quot; made from wheat, barley and peas. 
#* The two primary styles of this liquor are &quot;Fenjiu&quot; (汾酒, &quot;fénjiǔ&quot;) from Shanxi and &quot;Erguotou&quot; (二锅头, &quot;èrguōtóu&quot;) from Beijing, the latter of which is known as Kaoliang (高粱, &quot;gāoliáng&quot;, lit. &#x27;sorghum&#x27;) in Taiwan. Formerly this style was called Fenxiang &quot;Fen-aroma&quot; (, &quot;fēnxiāng&quot;) after the Shanxi Xinghuacun Fenjiu Distillery (). 
# Mixiang (, &quot;mǐxiāng; rice aroma&quot;): 
#* This class of liquor is exemplified by baijiu distilled from rice, such as &quot;Sanhuajiu&quot; (三花酒) from Guilin, Guangxi province. 
#* This fragrance has long history and is made using rice-based &quot;Rhizopus spp.&quot;-type Qu starters (小曲, &quot;xiǎoqū&quot;, lit. &#x27;little &quot;qu&quot;). 
#* It has a clean sensation and a slight aroma, dominated by ethyl lactate with lesser flavor contributions by ethyl acetate.
# Nongxiang (, &quot;nóngxiāng; strong aroma&quot;): 
#* A class of distilled liquor that is sweet tasting and mellow, with a gentle lasting fragrance contributed by the high levels of esters, primarily ethyl hexanoate, which give the spirit a strong taste of pineapple, banana and anise. 
#* Most alcohols of this aroma are distilled from sorghum, sometimes in combination with other grains, continuously fermented in mud pits. 
#* This style is formerly known as Luxiang &quot;Lu aroma&quot; (, &quot;lúxiāng&quot;), as it is thought to be invented in the Luzhou Laojiao Distillery in Luzhou, Sichuan province. Other notable examples of this type of liquor are &quot;Wuliangye&quot; from Yibin, Sichuan; &quot;Jiannanchun&quot; from Mianzhu, Sichuan; and &quot;Yanghe&quot; from Suqian, Jiangsu province. The Ming River Baijiu for the western market is also this category.
# Jiangxiang (, &quot;jiàngxiāng; sauce aroma&quot;): 
#* A fragrant distilled sorghum liquor of bold character, named for its similarity in flavor to fermented bean pastes and soy sauces. 
#* It is made from sorghum repeatedly fermented in stone brick pits. It has large amounts of ester compounds, which impart a layered umami flavor. 
#* A highly controversial profile – like it or hate it. Not recommended for beginners but highly recommended for experienced drinkers. Some consider it as funky. It is an acquired taste, like peaty whisky.
#* To the initiated, it is considered a complement for preserved and pickled foods (酱菜, &quot;jiàngcài&quot;). This class was formerly known as Maoxiang &quot;Mao-aroma&quot; (茅香), after the best known spirit of this class, &quot;Maotai&quot;.

Various other niche aroma profiles:

*&quot;Chi&quot; xiang (豉香, &quot;chǐxiāng; douchi /douban flavored), or &quot;Zhi&quot; xiang (脂香, &quot;zhīxiāng; fat aroma): 
** Named after &quot;douchi&quot;, the popular Chinese condiment made from fermented bean, this is a savory rice-based baijiu from Guangdong notable for the addition of pork fat during the aging process.
*Fuyu xiang (馥郁香, &quot;fùyùxiāng; extra-strong aroma&quot;): 
** This category refers to the liquor produced by the Jiugui (酒鬼) Distillery in Hunan. Distilled from sorghum, rice, glutinous rice, wheat, and corn that has been fermented with big &quot;qu&quot; and medicinal small &quot;qu&quot;.
*&quot;Laobaigan&quot; xiang (老白干香, &quot;lǎobáigānxiāng; laobaigan aroma&quot;): 
** Similar to light-aroma baijiu, but fermented with wheat-based big &quot;qu&quot; and bottled at extremely high proof. Most often associated with the Hengshui Ruitian (衡水瑞天) Distillery in Hebei.
*Yao xiang (藥香, &quot;yàoxiāng; medicinal aroma&quot;): 
** A pungent liquor that originates at the Dongjiu (董酒) Distillery in Guizhou. Medicine aroma is distilled from the combination of two separate pit-fermented sorghum mashes, one fermented with wheat &quot;qu&quot; in a large pit and one fermented with medicinal rice &quot;qu&quot; in a small pit.
*Jian xiang (, &quot;jiānxiāng; mixed aroma&quot;): 
** A class of distilled liquors that is a blend of two or more varieties of baijiu. As such, liquors of this class vary widely in their aroma, mouth-feel, and dryness.
*Feng xiang(, &quot;fèngxiāng; Xifeng style aroma&quot;): 
**A class of distilled liquor fermented in mud pits and aged in rattan containers. Liquors of this class have a fruity taste similar to strong-aroma baijiu, but also an earthier quality and an expanding finish. An example of this type of liquor is &quot;Xifengjiu&quot; from Fengxiang County in Shaanxi.
*Zhima xiang (芝麻香, &quot;zhīmaxiāng; sesame aroma&quot;): 
** A class of liquor distilled from sorghum, millet, or barley in stone pits with mud floors. Invented by the Jingzhi Distillery in the 1950s, sesame aroma employs similar production techniques to sauce-aroma baijiu, and has a charred, nutty flavor.
*Xiaoqu Qingxiang (小曲清香, &quot;xiǎoqū qīngxiāng; qingxiang with small-batched qu&quot;): 
** A style of baijiu distilled from sorghum that has been fermented with rice-based small &quot;qu&quot;.
*Te xiang (特香, &quot;tèxiāng; Si&#x27;te distillery special aroma&quot;): 
** A rice-based baijiu fermented in brick pits with big qu, it originates from the Si&#x27;te (四特) Distillery in Jiangxi, where the iconic &quot;Si&#x27;tejiu&quot; originated&quot;.&quot;

===Regional varieties ===
Other than by aroma, Baijiu can also differ by styles, production methods, ingredients etc. Regional varieties of Baijiu are often somewhat unique in flavor profile and production method.

Some examples of regional varieties include: 
* Daqujiu (大曲酒/大麴酒, &quot;Dàqūjiǔ&quot;): Originally from Sichuan. This liquor is made with sorghum and wheat &quot;qu&quot; and is fermented for two to three months in mud pits. Nongxiang type baijiu.

It is often inexpensive and thus particularly popular amongst blue-collar workers across northern and northeastern China. It is probably the most commonly-drunk &quot;baijiu&quot; in Beijing and is frequently associated with that city. Beijing Hongxing, more commonly referred to simply as &quot;Hongxing&quot; (, &quot;Red Star&quot;) is a popular brand.

* Fenjiu (汾酒, &quot;fénjiǔ&quot;): Grain alcohol in Fenyang, Shanxi dates back to the Northern and Southern dynasties (AD 550). Most commonly associated with the Xinghuacun Distillery, Fenjiu is a Qingxiang type sorghum baijiu fermented with &quot;qu&quot; made from barley and peas.

Alcohol content by volume: 32% and 38–39% respectively. &quot;Samshu&quot; was the name by which most foreign travelers knew baijiu during the Qing dynasty.

==== Popular infusions ====
Throughout the evolutionary history of baijiu, numerous regional variations in alcohol production technique across the country have been incorporated into baijiu making. The practice of infusing alcohol with herbs, spices, fruits and other ingredients has its roots in traditional Chinese medicine and herbology, but is also done purely for flavor. Infusing spirits is a common practice.

==Baijiu brands==

Baijiu are often distinguishable by distillery. The distinct aroma and taste profile is likely to be the specialty of that region. Therefore, often the name of the brand is the same as the name of the baijiu and the distillery. However, bigger brands tend to have a series of different types of baijiu as well as their signature baijiu. Beginners are recommended to try the signature baijiu of the brand first, to learn about their style of baijiu making.

Due to its long history, almost every province in China has at least one regional specialty baijiu. However, Guizhou and Sichuan are the two biggest, particularly famous baijiu-making provinces, where numerous distilleries can be found. Below is a non-exhaustive list of relatively well-known Baijiu brands, grouped by place of origin, in descending order of popularity (semi-arbitrary and subjective).

&quot;*Many other brands exist, but usually only produced, sold and consumed locally and therefore lesser-known and not included in the list.&quot;

<text>The Central-West or Center-West Region of Brazil ( ) is composed of the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul; along with the Distrito Federal (Federal District), where Brazil&#x27;s national capital, Brasília, is situated. The region comprises 18.86% of the national territory, and is the least populated in Brazil.

With the move of the country&#x27;s federal capital from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília in the 1960s, the construction of roads and railways to the interior of the country made access to the region easier, speeding up population growth and contributing significantly to the region&#x27;s development.

Mato Grosso do Sul was created in 1979, materializing the decision of the government to divide the then called state of Mato Grosso in two states to facilitate to administration and the development of the region.

Brasília International Airport, Marechal Rondon International Airport, Campo Grande International Airport and Santa Genoveva Airport connects the Center-West region with many Brazilian cities and also operates some international flights.

The Center-West is home to the University of Brasília, University Center of Brasília, Federal University of Goiás, Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Federal University of Mato Grosso and Federal University of Rondonópolis.

The most populous state of the region, Goiás presents a landscape of plateaus and &quot;chapadões&quot;. At the height of the drought, from June to September, the lack of rain makes the level of the River Araguaia go down and brings up almost 2 km of beaches.

At the Emas National Park in the municipality of Chapadão do Céu, it is possible to observe the typical fauna and the flora from the region. At the Chapada dos Veadeiros the attractions include canyons, valleys, rapids and waterfalls. Other attractions are the historical city of Goiás (or Old Goiás), at 132 km from Goiânia, established at the beginning of the 18th century, and Caldas Novas, known for its hot springs.

===Federal District===
Located in the state of Goiás in a region called Planalto Central, the Federal District is divided in 31 administrative regions. Brasília - where the three branches of the federal government are located - is the main attraction of this dry area with only two seasons. The rainy season is from October to March.

During the dry season, the humidity can reach critical levels, mainly in the peak hours of the hottest days. The artificial lake of Paranoá, with almost 40 km2 and 500 million m3 of water, was built to minimize the severe climatic conditions of the winter. The region also attracts mystics, and in its surroundings one can find many temples of different religions and sectarian groups.

==Tourism and recreation==

Tourism has grown at impressive speed in the last decades there, attracting visitors from several parts of Brazil and the world; who all enjoy the Region&#x27;s flora and fauna riches, as well as its numerous marvelous views.

Located in the middle of the vast Central Upland, the Central-West Region reveals how attractive the tours in the interior of the country can be. Starting in the west part of Mato Grosso do Sul State and the southeast part of Mato Grosso State, we have Pantanal Mato-grossense; the largest swampy plain area in the world, cut by the Paraguai River. Its fauna and flora riches draw the attention of the world. In the same state, it&#x27;s possible to take tours through pleasant places, such as Alta Floresta, where ecotourism is the greatest attraction; Bonito, one of the places with the most crystalline waters in the country; and Chapada dos Guimarães National Park, full of mountains and beautiful landscapes offered by the meadow vegetation.

Dividing the States of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás, the Araguaia River attracts numerous fishermen from all parts of Brazil and the world. And in the state of Goiás, historical attractions, such as Pirenópolis draw many visitors all year long, with its steep stone-paved streets and its colonial houses. Other attractions in the same state include Chapada dos Veadeiros and the National Park of Emas, where the contact with nature is the essence of the tours. In the Federal District, the National Park of Brasília is one of the greatest local attractions.

==Infrastructure==

===International airports===
*Brasília
Brasília International Airport - President Juscelino Kubitschek (BSB/SBBR) serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights.
Brasília International Airport is the third largest in Brazil in terms of passenger movement. Because of its strategic location it is considered a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual flights to have to wait in the holding pattern to land. Following the airport&#x27;s master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. 

*Cuiabá
The runway at Marechal Rondon International Airport was opened to traffic in 1956. In February 1975, Infraero took over the airport&#x27;s administration and began various upgrades to meet the needs of the airport complex. As of 1996, Marechal Rondon Airport, located from the city center, started receiving international flights. Currently it serves more than 900 thousand passengers a year.
*Campo Grande
The operation of Campo Grande International Airport is shared with the Campo Grande Air Base. The airport has two runways.
Construction of the main runway, made of concrete, began in 1950 and was finished in 1953. The passenger terminal was concluded in 1964, and in 1967 concrete aprons were built for both military and civilian aircraft. As commercial aviation demand grew, it became necessary to widen the civil aircraft apron, which was completed 12 years after its construction. The airport has been administered by Inferaero since 1975.

===National Airport===
*Goiânia
Santa Genoveva Airport is the main airport of Goiânia, providing flights to major cities in Brazil. Modernization work is underway to construct a new runway and terminal to handle the growing number of air passenger in and out of Goiânia.

<text>Purple Noon (; ; also known as Full Sun, Blazing Sun, Lust for Evil, and Talented Mr. Ripley) is a 1960 crime thriller film starring Alain Delon (in his first major role), alongside Marie Laforêt and Maurice Ronet; Romy Schneider, Delon&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, makes a brief cameo appearance in the film. The film follows Tom Ripley, a young American sent to Italy to convince wealthy playboy Philippe Greenleaf to return home. As Tom becomes obsessed with Philippe&#x27;s luxurious lifestyle, he devises a plan that will allow him to take over Philippe&#x27;s life. 

Directed by René Clément, the French/Italian international co-production is loosely based on the 1955 novel &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith. Anthony Minghella&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; and the 2024 streaming television series &quot;Ripley&quot; are adaptations of the same source novel. The majority of the film&#x27;s dialogue is spoken in French, although there are brief sequences in Italian and English.

==Plot==
Handsome young American Tom Ripley has been sent to Italy by the father of wealthy playboy Philippe Greenleaf to persuade him to return to San Francisco and take over the family business. Philippe has no intention of doing so, and the impoverished Tom falls into sharing in his escapades.

Tom becomes fixated on Philippe and his fiancée, Marge, and covets the other man&#x27;s life of luxury and leisure in the beautiful seaside town of Mongibello. Philippe eventually grows bored with Ripley&#x27;s fawning and becomes cruel and abusive to him. The final straw for Tom is reached during a yachting trip when Philippe strands him in the dinghy and accidentally leaves him to drift for hours in the blazing sun.

Back on board, Tom hatches a plan to kill Philippe and steal his identity. First, he leaves evidence of Philippe&#x27;s philandering for an outraged Marge to find. Finding that Tom has obtained his bank records, Philippe seeks to draw him out. After Marge goes ashore following a blow-up with Philippe, he confronts Tom, who admits his plan quite casually. Philippe offers Tom a substantial sum to leave him and Marge alone, but Tom rebuffs it, saying he is interested in far more. He fatally stabs Philippe, and after wrapping the corpse in canvas and weighting it with an anchor, he is preparing to dump it overboard when he is hit by the ship&#x27;s boom and knocked in the sea, taking Philippe&#x27;s corpse with him. Tom narrowly manages to make it back onto the ship.

Upon returning to Mongibello alone, Tom informs Marge that Philippe has decided to stay away. He then goes to Rome, skillfully replaces Philippe&#x27;s picture with his own in Philippe&#x27;s passport, masters forging Philippe&#x27;s signature, and successfully takes over the dead man&#x27;s wealth, identity, and lifestyle.

When Philippe&#x27;s friend Freddy Miles tracks down &quot;Philippe&#x27;s&quot; hideaway, he is surprised to only find Tom there. Feeling that Freddy is beginning to suspect the truth, Tom impulsively murders him and dumps the body outside town. Freddy&#x27;s body is soon found, and the Italian police become involved, suspecting &quot;Philippe&quot; in the murder. Tom continues his charade, switching between his own identity and Philippe&#x27;s to give the illusion that Philippe is still alive and on the run. 

Tom survives a string of close calls, throwing the Italian police off his trail and seemingly outwitting everyone. After forging Philippe&#x27;s suicide note and a will that leaves Philippe&#x27;s entire fortune to Marge, Tom thinks he is finally in the clear. He returns to Mongibello and then seduces Marge, in Philippe&#x27;s home.

Philippe&#x27;s father arrives in Mongibello to settle the transfer of Philippe&#x27;s estate and the sale of his yacht. Marge leaves Tom at the beach to go meet Philippe&#x27;s father, while Tom goes to a seaside cafe and celebrates the success of his gambit by ordering the best drink in the house. As Philippe&#x27;s boat is being pulled out of the water so a potential buyer can inspect it, Marge is horrified to see Philippe&#x27;s canvas-wrapped body dragged up the slipway behind it, the loose end of the lashing having become wrapped around the sailboat&#x27;s propeller. A police inspector from Rome who has been watching Tom goes to the cafe, where he has the waitress tell Tom, who is lounging in the sun, that there is a phone call for him. Tom smirks smugly and, unsuspecting, walks into a trap.

== Cast ==
Director Clément has an uncredited cameo appearance in the film as a clumsy waiter, and Romy Schneider, who was Delon&#x27;s girlfriend when the film was made, has an uncredited cameo appearance as one of Freddy&#x27;s female companions in the film&#x27;s opening scene.
==Production==
Delon was cast after Clément saw him in &quot;Women Are Weak&quot; (1959). Billy Kearns was an expatriate American actor well-liked in France.

Screenwriter Paul Gégauff wrote a variation on the same story in 1968 when he worked on &quot;Les biches&quot; with Claude Chabrol.

==Reception==
&quot;Purple Noon&quot; was lauded by critics and made Delon a star. In 1962, Clément and Gégauff won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Foreign Film Screenplay. The film enjoys a loyal cult following even today, with fans including film director Martin Scorsese.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars (compared to the four-star review he gave to 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;), writing that &quot;the best thing about the film is the way the plot devises a way for Ripley to create a perfect cover-up&quot;, while criticizing the &quot;less than satisfactory ending&quot;, about which he wrote: &quot;&quot;Purple Noon&quot; ends as it does only because Clement doesn&#x27;t have Highsmith&#x27;s iron nerve&quot;.

James Berardinelli rated &quot;Purple Noon&quot; higher than &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, giving it a four-star review (compared to two-and-a-half stars for &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;). Berardinelli praised Delon&#x27;s acting, writing that &quot;Tom is fascinating because Delon makes him so&quot;, and also complimented the film for &quot;expert camerawork and crisp direction&quot;. In the entry for &quot;Purple Noon&quot; on Berardinelli&#x27;s All-Time Top 100 list, he compared it to the 1999 film, saying: &quot;The remake went back to the source material, Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. The result, while arguably truer to the events of Highsmith&#x27;s book, is vastly inferior. To say it suffers by comparison to &quot;Purple Noon&quot; is an understatement. Almost every aspect of Rene Clement&#x27;s 1960 motion picture is superior to that of Minghella&#x27;s 1999 version, from the cinematography to the acting to the screenplay. Matt Damon might make a credible Tom Ripley but only for those who never experienced Alain Delon&#x27;s portrayal.&quot;

Nandini Ramnath, writing for Scroll.in, said: &quot;The definitive portrayal of crime novelist Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s most enduring creation was as early as 1960. Damon and Hopper come close to conveying the ruthlessness and ambition of Tom Ripley, but Delon effortlessly captures his mystique.&quot;

Highsmith&#x27;s opinion of the film was mixed. She felt that Alain Delon was &quot;excellent&quot; in the role of Tom Ripley and described the film overall as &quot;very beautiful to the eye and interesting for the intellect&quot;, but criticized the ending (in which it is implied that Ripley is to be caught by the police): &quot;[I]t was a terrible concession to so-called public morality that the criminal had to be caught.&quot;

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;Purple Noon&quot; as one of his 100 favorite films.

==Restoration and re-release==
In 2012, StudioCanal funded a restoration of the film by the laboratory, to be shown at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival as part of an homage to Delon&#x27;s career prior to a theatrical re-release in (at least) France.

On 4 December 2012, The Criterion Collection released the high-definition digital restoration of &quot;Purple Noon&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD. Special features include an interview with René Clément scholar and author Denitza Bantcheva, archival interviews with Alain Delon and Patricia Highsmith, the film&#x27;s original English-language trailer, and a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien and excerpts from a 1981 interview with Clément. The film has also been released on Blu-ray in the UK and Germany (by StudioCanal in 2013), and Japan (by Kinokuniya in 2011).

<doc id="1279801" wikidata="Q522915" url="?curid=1279801" title="Madelyn Pugh">
<text>Madelyn Pugh (March 15, 1921 – April 20, 2011), sometimes credited as Madelyn Pugh Davis, Madelyn Davis, or Madelyn Martin, was an American television writer who became known in the 1950s for her work on the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; television series.

==Early life and education==
Pugh was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to I. Watt Pugh, a bank treasurer, and Louise Huff. She had two older sisters, Audrey and Rosalind.

During her senior year at Shortridge High School, she was co-editor of the high school newspaper, along with her classmate Kurt Vonnegut. She graduated in 1938, two years before Vonnegut.

In 1942, she graduated from Indiana University&#x27;s School of Journalism.

==Career==
Pugh became interested in writing while serving as Friday editor of the Shortridge High School daily newspaper in Indianapolis, Indiana with classmate Kurt Vonnegut. At Shortridge she also served as vice president of her senior class. Her first professional writing job was writing short radio spots for WIRE, an Indianapolis radio station.

When her family moved to California, she got work as a radio writer, first for NBC and then CBS, where she met Bob Carroll. Pugh credits some of her breakthrough as &quot;the girl writer&quot; to the war effort, which limited the pool of qualified male writers; she was frequently the only female writer on staff.

Early in her career, as a staff writer for CBS Radio in Hollywood, Pugh forged a partnership with Bob Carroll Jr. which lasted more than 50 years. Together they wrote some 400 television programs and roughly 500 radio shows. While the team was writing for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, they became interested in writing for Lucille Ball&#x27;s new radio show, &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. They paid Allen to write his own show one week so they could focus on creating a script submission for &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. Under the supervision of head writer Jess Oppenheimer, the pair wrote Ball&#x27;s radio program for its 2½ years.

Pugh and Carroll helped create a vaudeville act for Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, which became the basis for the pilot episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Together with Oppenheimer and/or Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf, who joined the show at the beginning of the fifth year, the team tackled 39 episodes per season for the run of the series. Although they never won, Pugh and Carroll were nominated for three Emmy Awards for their work on the series.

Pugh and Carroll are credited with helping create the &#x27;Lucy&#x27; character, which Ball played in one form or another for over 40 years. The pair also wrote episodes for &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot; (aka &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;) and Ball&#x27;s final series, &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; (1986).

The pair&#x27;s other writing credits include work on the television series &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;, &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot;, &quot;Dorothy&quot;, &quot;Those Whiting Girls&quot;, &quot;Kocham Klane&quot; (an &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; series remake in Poland) and &quot;The Tom Ewell Show&quot;. They also worked on the films &quot;Forever, Darling&quot; and &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;, starring Ball. They created and wrote the Desi Arnaz Productions series &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot; (filmed at Desilu), which starred actresses Kaye Ballard and Eve Arden. The two served for seven years as executive producers of the long-running television series &quot;Alice&quot; and occasionally contributed scripts, one of which was awarded a Golden Globe Award.

In September 2005, Madelyn Pugh Davis, who lived in California, released her memoirs, titled &quot;Laughing with Lucy&quot;, written with Bob Carroll Jr.

==Personal life and death==
Pugh was married twice, first to TV producer Quinn Martin on December 24, 1955, in Los Angeles, until their 1960 divorce. They had a son, Michael Quinn Martin. She later married Dr. Richard Merrill Davis in 1964, and they remained married until his death in 2009.
 Pugh Davis died on April 20, 2011, aged 90, in Bel Air, California, and her ashes were in a place of honor on display in the Chapel columbarium, at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Works and publications==

Pugh was played by Alia Shawkat (younger) and Linda Lavin (older) in &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot;, a 2021 film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin.

<doc id="1279803" wikidata="Q478465" url="?curid=1279803" title="North Region, Brazil">
<text>The North Region of Brazil ( ) is the largest region of Brazil, accounting for 45.27% of the national territory. It has the second-lowest population of any region in the country, and accounts for a minor percentage of the national GDP. The region is slightly larger than India and slightly smaller than the whole European Union. It comprises the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins.

It has the lowest population density out of all the regions of Brazil, with only 4.5 inhabitants per km2. Most of the population is centered in urban areas.

Belém International Airport and Manaus International Airport connect the North Region with many Brazilian cities and also operate some international flights. The region is home to the Federal University of Amazonas and the Federal University of Pará, among others.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the North Region, as in the rest of Brazil, were the Native Brazilians, who shared a diverse number of tribes and villages, from the pre-Columbian period until the arrival of the European people.

The Spaniards, among them Francisco de Orellana, organized exploratory expeditions by the Amazon River to know the region. After long journeys alongside Francisco de Orellana, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés wrote a letter addressed to Cardinal Pedro Bembo in Venice, extolling the fauna and flora existing in the region at the time of the expedition.

The 17th century marked the arrival of the Portuguese people, where they built military strongholds to defend the region against the invasion of other peoples, in 1616, causing in the foundation of Belém do Pará. The richness of the Amazon Rainforest has also become interesting for the Portuguese Crown. With the Portuguese explorers, the Catholic missionaries came to the region, in order to catechize the natives. The natives were assembled by missionaries in villages, called missions, many of which gave birth to several cities, such as Borba and Óbidos.

Some of the Region&#x27;s oldest towns: Bragança, Xapuri, Tefé, Natividade and Amapá. In order to work on rubber extraction, Brazilians from other states, mainly from the Northeast Region, moved to the region. Also many Japanese families came to work in the agricultural colonies.

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, military governments implemented a major plan to integrate the region with other regions of Brazil, including the construction of several highways (such as the BR-010), the installation of industries and the creation of the Free Economic Zone of Manaus.

===Settlement===
The territorial division into countries does not necessarily coincide with the indigenous occupation of the geographical space; in many cases, there are people living on both sides of international borders, which were created long after they were already in the region.

From the beginning of the colonization from the 17th century to the present day, the inhabitants of Amazônia dedicated themselves to extractive and mercantilist activities, inserting between 1840 and 1910 the monopoly of rubber, mainly in Amazonas and Acre. All this process of colonization has brought about changes such as the reduction of the indigenous population, the increase of the &quot;Caboclo identity&quot;, the mixing of whites, blacks and indigenous people, the reduction of species of plants and animals and other consequences.

After World War II, the Brazilian Amazon became part of the national development process. The creation of the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA) in 1952, the establishment of regional development agencies such as the Superintendency of Development for the Amazon (SUDAM) in 1966 and the Free Economic Zone of Manaus in 1967 began to contribute to the settlement of region and in the execution of projects focused on the region.

==Geography==
The Amazon represents over half of the planet&#x27;s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world.
Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than 1/3 of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.
The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2000 birds and mammals species. To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 3,000 fish, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region. Scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone.

The diversity of plant species is the highest on earth with some experts estimating that one square kilometre may contain over 75,000 types of trees and 150,000 species of higher plants. One square kilometre of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants. This constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world. One in five of all the birds in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon. To date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogue

Some latitudes can create a region with hot and humid climates. The existence of heat and the enormous liquid mass favor evaporation and make the region a very humid area.

Dominated by an equatorial climate, the region presents high temperatures throughout the year (averages from 24 °C to 26 °C), a low thermal amplitude, with the exception of some areas of the states of Amazonas, Rondônia and Acre, where the phenomenon of &quot;friagem&quot; occurs, due to La Niña&#x27;s activity, allowing cold air masses coming from the South Atlantic Ocean to penetrate the states of the South Region of the country, pass through the Central-West region and reach the Amazonian states, causing rapidly falling temperature.

The Amazonian heat provides an area of low latitude that attracts masses of polar air. Occurring in winter, the effect of &quot;friagem&quot; lasts a week or so.

==Political Subdivisions==

==Culture==

With its own folklore, the main attractions are the Parintins Folklore Festival, Círio de Nazaré in Belém, Rio Branco and Macapá; Sairé Festival, in Santarém, ExpoAcre (the largest in the North region) and typical dances, Marujada, Carimbó, Brazilian Calypso, Tecno brega and Cirandas such as Samba lelê and others.

In the region, there are some of the most beautiful theaters and palaces in Brazil: The Amazon Theatre, located in Manaus, Palácio Rio Branco, in Rio Branco, Palácio Senador Hélio Campos, in Boa Vista, Teatro das Bacabeiras, in Macapá and the Peace Theatre, located in Belém.
The gastronomic culture of the northern region of Brazil is quite rich, has Indigenous, African and Portuguese roots, in addition to other influences from both within Brazil and other cultures outside the country, the strong Amazonian indigenous influence in its main dishes is remarkable, among the main highlights are delicacies such as duck in tucupi sauce, maniçoba, tacacá and a menu of a wide variety of species of Amazonian fish, such as pirarucu, tambaqui, jaú, piramutaba, among other species; a huge menu of fruits, such as the local açaí, pupunha, tucumã, cupuaçu, buriti, abiu, urucu, Malay apple, cumaru, guaraná, and ingá, among other fruits. The whole region has a rich variety of ingredients, but also foods based on cassava such as water flour, uarini flour, tapioca flour, tapioca gum, tucupi, among others.

==Ethnic groups==
The population of northern Brazil is largely made up of Caboclos, descendants of Native Brazilians and Europeans - mostly Portuguese, French and Spanish.

North of Brazil has received and continues to receive large migration of people from South and Southeast regions of the country. In the 20th century, also received great migration from the Northeast, who were working in the rubber plantations of Amazonas and Acre.

==Economy==

The economy of the North Region is essentially based on the vegetal plantation and extraction, such as latex, açaí, woods and Brazil nuts; and mineral extraction of gold, precious stones, cassiterite and tin (metal); as well as mining exploitation, mainly iron, at Carajás Mountain Range (in the State of Pará) and manganese, at Navio Mountain Range (in the State of Amapá). Small-scale Buffalo creation and the Free Economic Zone of Manaus are also important to the local economy.

==Infrastructure==
Vehicles: 1,746,501 (March/2007);
Telephones: 1,805,000 (April/2007);
Cities: 449 (2007).

Portuguese language is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. However, English and Spanish are also part of the official high school curriculum.

<text>The South Improvement Company was a short-lived Pennsylvania corporation founded in late 1871 which existed until the state of Pennsylvania suspended its charter on April 2, 1872. It was created by major railroad and oil interests, and was widely seen as part of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s early efforts to organize and control the oil industry in the United States under Standard Oil. The company&#x27;s purpose was to end a rate war with the rail trunk lines by dividing oil traffic more evenly between the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Erie Railroad, and the New York Central railroads. The second purpose of the company was to limit the production of refined oil - the country had a daily refining capacity of 40,000 barrels and a market for only 16,000. Although the company never shipped any oil, the South Improvement Company scheme caused widespread attention to be focused on the relationships between big railroads and big businesses that wanted and demanded favorable treatment. In what would become known as the Cleveland Massacre, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler bought eighteen refineries, only one of which wasn&#x27;t located in Cleveland over a month&#x27;s time between mid-February and mid-March 1872. 

==Formation==
Thomas A. Scott, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad established the South Improvement Company in the fall of 1871. A group representing the trunk railroad interests and oil refinery interests met in New York in late November, 1871, to discuss the creation of the company. Included in this meeting were William Henry Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller. The scheme was intended to benefit both the railroads and major refiners, notably those controlled by Rockefeller through secret rebates. 

Rockefeller had earlier merged several of the Cleveland area refineries and issued 2,000 shares of stock, of which 900 were controlled by Rockefeller and his partners. Rockefeller then started negotiations to collude with the three major railroads running through Cleveland: the Erie Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the New York Central Railroad. The result of these secret negotiations were as follows: (1) The official rate per barrel from Cleveland to New York would be $2.56, but South Improvement would receive a $1.06 rebate; (2) The railroads would also pay South Improvement $1.06 per barrel of oil shipped that was not produced by South; (3) The railroads would also give reports of the shipping destinations, costs, and dates of all of South&#x27;s competitors; (4) The commerce would be divided evenly among the railroads, with a double share going to Pennsylvania Railroad; and (5) South would provide tank cars and loading facilities.
The secret concessions would have helped lessen the &quot;vicious&quot; competition among the railroad lines by giving a steady, standardized flow of commerce.

Shares of the South Improvement Company were allocated to interests in the oil refining cities as follows: Pittsburgh received 485, Philadelphia received 505, Cleveland received 720, and New York received 180 (represented by Jabez A. Bostwick). Peter H. Watson, as president of the South Improvement Company, received 100 shares. Since both Bostwick and Watson were secretly allied with Standard Oil, Rockefeller kept control of the company from the Pennsylvania oil refiners and Pennsylvania Railroad interests. Charles Pratt of New York and John Dustin Archbold and Jacob Vandergrift of the oil regions had refused to join and so did not receive shares.

Rockefeller used the company as a tool to force Cleveland refiners to further consolidate. Between mid-February and mid-March 1872, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler bought twenty-three companies, eighteen of which were oil refineries, and all but one of them were located in Cleveland. Historians would come to call this the &quot;Cleveland Massacre.&quot; An independent refiner who thought he could survive found that when he went to borrow money, all the Cleveland banks were in Standard Oil&#x27;s pocket. Rockefeller had offered every important Cleveland banker a chance to buy Standard Oil stock, ensuring the welfare of the Standard Oil company.

==Dissolution==
Word leaked out of the South Improvement scheme, and the proposed 100% increase in rail shipping rates inflamed the independent producers and many smaller refineries. Following a summit and vocal protest by the independent oil producers and refiners led by Henry Huttleston Rogers and the Charles Pratt and Company refining interests of Brooklyn, New York, which came close to physical warfare in western Pennsylvania in March 1872 (and came to be known as the &quot;Oil War&quot;), the railroads agreed to back down. 

Crude oil suppliers formed their own organization called the Petroleum Producers&#x27; Union which levied a boycott on all members of the South Improvement Company on March 1, 1872. The producers&#x27; union also agreed to stop drilling wells for 30 days. On March 2, 1872, the Pennsylvania Railroad sent a message to the oil regions indicating that their lines would not harm the mutually beneficial relationship between the railroads and the producers. By March 9th, newspapers were generally attacking the South Improvement Company as an assault on free enterprise. On March 11, 1872, New York refiners sent a delegation to the oil regions to back the suppliers&#x27; opposition to the South Improvement Company. On March 23, John D. Rockefeller met with producers, refiners, and railroad leaders. On March 25, 1872, railroad leaders ended their contracts with South and publicly announced that thereafter no rebates would be made or allowed. The state of Pennsylvania suspended its charter on April 2, 1872. On April 10, the suppliers&#x27; oil embargo was officially lifted. Two weeks after the railroad contracts with the South Improvement Company were ended, the Pennsylvania Railroad gave rebates to refiners on its lines.

==Aftermath==
After the company&#x27;s dissolution, refiners were once again in a position where they competed with each other on a regional basis - now largely Rockefeller in Cleveland, Charles Lockhart in Pittsburgh, William G. Warden in Philadelphia, Charles Pratt in New York, and John Dustin Archbold in the oil regions. In April 1872, these leaders tried to coordinate with each other to obtain better rates from the railroads by creating the National Refiners&#x27; Association. This group would be administered by a central board of their own choosing, would operate in the open, would buy and allot crude oil to members via quota, and would negotiate with railroads on behalf of members. The oil producers did not object to the organization because the organizers made clear they were not seeking to reduce the price of crude oil. Rockefeller was chosen to head the organization because refiners did not fear his takeover of this organization. The association collapsed at the beginning of the Panic of 1873. Standard Oil would buy up the interests of these four oil leaders by 1875 and they would in turn administer these regions for the company.

<text>The Patapédia River (, ) is a tributary of the Restigouche River in Northwest New Brunswick and Southeast Quebec, in Canada.

The course of river in Quebec (upper segment) has its beginnings the Matapédia Valley in the regional county municipality of La Mitis of the Gaspé Peninsula, in the administrative region of Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, while its end forms the natural provincial border between Quebec and New Brunswick before flowing into the Restigouche River at the &quot;Million Dollar Pool&quot;. Also known as the Patapédia Pool, the deep, cold reservoir gets its name from the abundance of salmon that gather there every season.

The upper part of the river is served by forest roads in Zec du Bas-Saint-Laurent. The lower part of Quebec Bank of the river is served by forest roads from the Matapedia Valley such Thomas road, coming from the village of L&#x27;Ascension-de-Patapédia, Quebec. The New Brunswick bank of the river has no carrosables access roads because of the rugged mountains along the lower course of the river.

== Geography ==

Patapedia river originates at Lac Long (Long Lake) (length: ; height: ) in the unorganized territory of Lac-des-Eaux-Mortes, Quebec, in Zec du Bas-Saint-Laurent, in Quebec. This lake is located in the northern part of the Zec du Bas-Saint-Laurent or close to the limit of the ZEC and the Southeastern limit of the Massé township. The mouth of the lake is located at:
* North of Montagnais Lake;
* to the Southwest from the Lac-Mitis village;
* Northwest of the confluence of the Patapédia River;
* Southeast of the Southeast coast of Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

The Patapédia river flows on generally toward the Southeast, entirely in forest land.

Upper course of Patapédia River (segment of )

From its source at the mouth of Long Lake, the Patapédia river flows:
* Eastward up to the discharge (from the South) of Montagnais Lake (length: ; height: ) and Metsébagot (length: ; height: );
* Eastward up to Silver Creek (from the North);
* to the Southeast, up to the outlet of Maliset Lake (from the West);
* to the East up to the West bank of &quot;Hunters Lake&quot; which is located between the &quot;Mountain Height&quot; (which is on the South side) and the &quot;Mountain Lac des Chasseurs&quot; (located on the North side);
* to the Southeast, crossing the &quot;Hunters Lake&quot; (altitude: ) over its full length up to its mouth;
* to the Southeast up to the West shore of Patapédia Lake which is located at the foot of the &quot;Moose Mountain&quot;;
* to the Southeast, crossing the Patapédia Lake (altitude: ) over its full length up to its mouth.

Intermediate course upstream of Patapédia Lake (segment of )

From the mouth of the Patapédia Lake, the Patapédia river flows:
* to the Southeast, crossing a small lake on which proves to be an extension of Patapédia Lake, up to a stream (from the East);
* to the Southwest, up to the confluence of &quot;Le Gros Ruisseau&quot; (from the West);
* to the Southeast, then East, up to a stream (from the North);
* Eastward up to a creek (from the South);
* Eastward, forming a detour to the North to a stream (from the South);
* to the Northeast, up to a stream (from the Southeast);
* to the Northeast, up to the confluence of the East Patapédia River (from the North-West).

Intermediate course upstream of the East Patapédia River (segment of )

From the confluence of the East Patapédia River, the Patapédia river flows:
* to the Southeast, up to a stream (from the North);
* to the Southeast, up to a stream (from the North);
* to the southeast, up to the confluence of the Meadow River (Patapédia River) (from the Northeast);
* to the Southeast, up to a stream (from the East);
* to the South, up to a creek (from the Southwest);
* to the South, up to the Southeast limit of the unorganized territory of Lac-des-Eaux-Mortes, Quebec, is at the Northern limit of the New Brunswick.

Lower course of the river Patapédia (segment of )

From the Southeast limit of the unorganized territory of Lac-des-Eaux-Mortes, Quebec, the Patapédia river delimits the Quebec (Roncesvalles Township) and the New Brunswick (Restigouche County), to the confluence of the river, as follows:
* to the Southeast, up to a stream (from the East);
* to the Southwest up to a stream (from the West);
* to the South, up to a creek (from the West);
* to the South, then East, up to a creek (from the Southwest);
* to the South, up to confluence of Pollard Brook (from the southwest);
* to the Southeast, forming six river bends, up to a stream (from the North);
* Eastward up to Cinq-Mars stream (from the North);
* Eastward up to Guérette stream (from the North);
* Eastward up to Wild Creek (from the West);
* Eastward up to Fivemile Creek (from the West). Note: The confluence of the creek &quot;Five Mile Gulch&quot; (from the West) or the New Brunswick is located at upstream of the confluence of Fivemile Creek;
* Eastward up to a creek (from the North);
* to the East, then South, up to a stream (from the Southwest);
* to the Southeast, winding up to the confluence of the river 

After rounding an island at the confluence, the Patapédia River empties into a river bend on the West bank of the Restigouche River, on the edge of the unorganized territory of Ruisseau-Ferguson, Quebec, of the regional county municipality (MRC) of Avignon Regional County Municipality. This confluence forms the boundary of Quebec and New Brunswick and is located at:
* upstream of the confluence of Whites Brook (New Brunswick) (coming from the Est);
* Southwest of the bridge crossing the Restigouche River to link the city of Campbellton, New Brunswick (in New Brunswick) and the village of Pointe-à-la-Croix, Quebec;
* Southwest of the confluence of the Matapedia River;
* Northwest of Kedgwick downtown, in New Brunswick.

== Toponymy ==

The toponym &quot;Patapédia River&quot; was officialized on December 5, 1968, at Commission de toponymie du Québec (Quebec Place Names Board).

== Fishes and wildlife ==

Patapédia river is known for its Atlantic salmon fishing. The CGRMP (Corporation de Gestion des Rivières Matapédia et Patapédia - Management Corporation of Rivers Matapedia and Patapédia) administers sport fishing area of the river; it is a non-profit organization constituted as of March 5, 1991 under the 3rd part of &quot;Loi des compagnies du Québec&quot;. This creation resulted of the grouping of 23 municipalities spread over two Regional County Municipality (RCM): La Matapedia Regional County Municipality and Avignon Regional County Municipality.

The upstream migration of salmon in the Patapédia River is usually done in early June, while between 600 and 1,000 specimens date back its course. The recreational salmon fishery usually opens in early June for a period of three months. The heyday of the fishing season is between the last week of June and the second week of August. The CGRMP offers accommodation in all sectors.

Patapédi river is divided in three sectors for fishing quotas. Fishing rights are drawn. The first sector includes 16 tanks (including Big Indian, Ravin Brûlé and Twin Upper); the second includes 38 tanks (including Berge red Fosse Swimming and Hewitt); the third sector includes 20 tanks (including Field of Blueuts, Fosse Albini and Salmon Hole).

<text>Spheres () is a South Korean animated television series comprising 26 episodes, first broadcast by Studio Kaab on MBC TV in 2003.

The now-defunct Studio Kaab went on to animate the series &quot;Nalong&quot;, the flying squirrel from &quot;Spheres&quot;.

==Story== 

Unbeknownst to human history, the Kingdom of Spheres existed upon Earth long ago. The people of this kingdom would be regarded today as people with psychic powers. Unfortunately, like most other civilizations, as the gap widened more and more between the social classes, the Kingdom of Spheres was troubled by those greedy for power; and in the end it collapsed. Na Yeon is a mysterious girl who was found in the Antarctic after the destruction of Spheres. One day Asten, the chairman of Sphere Union, who has a burning ambition to control the world, sent his followers to keep watch on Na Yeon. Na Yeon and her friends try to keep three artifacts, the keys to conquer the world, from the hands of Sphere Union.

In the Italian opening, Santo Verduci composed for TV show Contactoons.

<text>Robert Gordon Carroll Jr. (August 12, 1918 – January 27, 2007) was an American television writer notable for his creative role in the series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, the first four seasons of which he wrote with his professional partner Madelyn Pugh, and collaborator Jess Oppenheimer.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, Carroll&#x27;s family moved to Florida when he was three years old. His father made a living buying and selling real estate in the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The family also moved to California for a time in conjunction with Carroll Sr.&#x27;s work, but eventually settled back in St. Petersburg, Florida.

He attended St. Petersburg Junior College (now St. Petersburg College), where he studied French. He became a writer by happenstance. In 1940, he broke his hip in an accident. While he was recovering from his injury, he heard about a script writing contest being sponsored by local radio station WSUN. With plenty of time on his hands, the 21-year-old decided to try writing a radio script, which ended up winning the station&#x27;s $10 prize.

=== Hollywood years ===
Concerned that he might never work, due to his injury, Carroll felt very fortunate when his brother-in-law helped him get a job as the front desk clerk for CBS Radio in Hollywood, California. There, Carroll got a kick out of making celebrities sign in. He eventually worked his way up into the publicity department and moved from there to assignments as a junior and eventually senior writer.

There Carroll was teamed with fellow staffer Madelyn Pugh. The two created a partnership that lasted more than 50 years, and together wrote approximately 400 television episodes and 500 radio episodes. Though they briefly dated, they married other people.

While writing for Steve Allen&#x27;s early local radio program on CBS Radio station KNX in Los Angeles the duo became interested in writing for Lucille Ball&#x27;s new radio series &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. In an effort to seize that opportunity, they paid Allen to write his own show one week so that they could focus their energies on creating a script submission for &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. Successful, the pair wrote for Ball&#x27;s popular program for its 2½-year duration.

Carroll and Pugh helped develop and create a vaudeville act for Lucille Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz, which became the basis for the pilot episode of the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; series. Together the team tackled 39 episodes per season for the run of the show. Pugh and Carroll were nominated for three Emmys for their work on it; that total would likely have been considerably higher, but the Academy did not award Emmys to writers until 1954. The pair also wrote episodes of Ball&#x27;s subsequent series, &quot;The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, and, in 1986, her final sitcom, &quot;Life With Lucy&quot;.

===Later career===
The duo&#x27;s non-&quot;Lucy&quot; credits include work on the television series &quot;The Tom Ewell Show&quot;, &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot;, &quot;Dorothy&quot;, &quot;Those Whiting Girls&quot; and &quot;Kocham Klane&quot;. They created and wrote the successful Desilu series &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;, which starred Lucille Ball&#x27;s longtime MGM pals Eve Arden and Kaye Ballard. Carroll and Pugh served as executive producers and did some writing for the hit television series &quot;Alice&quot;, starring Linda Lavin, for which the duo won a Golden Globe Award. They also wrote the story basis for the film &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (1968).

In a 2005 interview with the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, Carroll discussed the fact that he and his writing partner Pugh did not receive any compensation for the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; re-runs, as would be standard for writers today. He did, however, keep his sense of humor over the situation telling a reporter: &quot;Do you think I&#x27;d be sitting here if I&#x27;d had residuals? I&#x27;d have flown you down to Cuba for this interview if I had.&quot;
He co-authored Madelyn Pugh Davis&#x27; memoir, &quot;Laughing with Lucy&quot;, published in September 2005.

Carroll died in Los Angeles after a brief illness. Divorced twice, he was survived by a daughter, Christina Carroll, of Los Angeles.

<text>The Nanjing Museum () is located in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu in East China. With an area of , it is one of the largest museums in China, with over 400,000 items in its permanent collection. Especially notable is the museum&#x27;s enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.

== History ==
The Nanjing Museum was one of the first museums established in China. The predecessor of the Nanjing Museum was the preparatory department of the National Central Museum, which was established in 1933. The museum took over in the Half Hill Garden of Zhongshan Gate. Cai Yuanpei, the first preparatory president of the council of the museum, proposed building three major halls, named &quot;Humanity,&quot; &quot;Craft&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;. Because of China&#x27;s political instability in the 1930s, only the Humanity Hall was built. During the Japanese invasion, part of its collections were transferred to Southwest China, and in the end moved to the National Palace Museum in Taipei when the Kuomintang lost the Chinese Civil War. The historian Fu Sinian and anthropologist and archaeologist Li Ji were once preparatory presidents, and the archaeologist and museologist Zeng Zhaoyu was the first female president and also a founder of Nanjing Museum. In 1999 and 2009, extensions were built to the museum.

== Buildings ==

The main building was designed by Liang Sicheng in the 1930s combining Chinese and Western architectural styles. The front section is structure of traditional style and features a golden tiled roof. In the back is a Western-style flat-roof structure. Added in the 1990s to the west of the main building is an art hall which references Chinese architecture of the first half of the 20th century.

==Exhibition halls==

There are twelve exhibition halls at the museum. A highlight of the collection is a full-size suit of armor made from small jade tiles held together by silver wire.

<text>St. Vital () is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba.

It was originally established in 1870, disestablished in 1879, and re-established by redistribution in 1957 into the modern riding.

==Historical riding==
The original St. Vital riding was established at the time of the province&#x27;s creation in 1870, as one of twelve &quot;francophone&quot; constituencies. It was eliminated in 1879, after a redistribution process which reduced the level of francophone representation in the province.

=== List of provincial representatives (1870-1879) ===
==Current riding==
The modern St. Vital riding was created by redistribution in 1957, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1958. The riding is located in the southeastern section of the City of Winnipeg.

St. Vital was bordered to the east by St. Boniface and Southdale, to the south by Riel, to the north by St. Boniface and to the west by Riel, Lord Roberts and Fort Garry (the latter two across the Red River of the North). As of the 2019 Manitoba election, it is bordered to the north by St. Boniface, to the east by Southdale, to the southeast by Lagimodière, to the south by Riel, to the west by Fort Garry, and to the northwest by Fort Rouge (the latter two across the Red River).

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,255. Its character is mostly middle-class, although 28% of the riding&#x27;s residents are categorized as low-income. In 1999, the average family income was $44,868, and the unemployment rate was 7.90%. Ten per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are francophone, and 7% are aboriginal. Almost half the riding&#x27;s dwellings are rental units.

The service sector accounts for 16% of St. Vital&#x27;s industry, with a further 13% in the retail trade.

St. Vital was represented by members of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1958 to 1971. Since then, it has generally been represented by members of the New Democratic Party (NDP), although the Liberals held the seat for one term from 1988 to 1990, and the Progressive Conservatives for two terms from 1990 to 1999.

<text>The Käymäjärvi inscriptions are two inscription-like mark rows on a stone approximately 52.5 cm high and 105 cm wide, engraved with characters similar to those in runic alphabets. The Käymäjärvi inscriptions are near Lake Käymäjärvi, about 26 km northwest of Pajala in northern Sweden. The inscriptions were first reported in 1689 and were thought to be man made. According to a 2018 report by archaeologists, geologists and historians; however, the inscriptions were found not to be man made but instead results of natural processes.

==First report==
The Käymäjärvi Inscriptions were first reported by Olof Rudbeck Sr. (1630–1702) in the second volume of &quot;Atlantica&quot; (1689). The local inhabitants, especially the Saami, considered the stone to carry a very important message from their ancestors.

==Second report==
The second author to report the inscriptions was Eric Brunnius (1706–83) of Uppsala University in a discussion about the town of Tornio (&quot;De urbe Torna&quot;; 1731). Brunnius states that the stone has rune characters and the engraving of a triple crown which was degraded and is absent. The physicist Anders Celsius (1701–44), also an early runologist, concluded that the inscriptions were not of runic character.

==Third report==
Celsius and Pierre Louis Maupertuis (1698–1759) visited the stone around 11 April 1737, during their Earth meridian measurement expedition. Celsius and Maupertuis both sketched the inscriptions in their diaries of the journey. The tale of this travel and stone, at that time considered to be very exotic in nature, was presented in his application to the Académie des Sciences and may have influenced the decision to elect him to the Academy.

==2018 report==
According to a study made by archaeologists, geologists and historians published in the &quot;Cambridge Archaeological Journal&quot; in 2018, the inscriptions are not man-made but instead a result of natural processes.

<text>Trashed is the second album by the punk rock group Lagwagon, released on January 4, 1994. This album builds on the skate punk sound of their debut album, with harmonized vocals and start-stop rhythms reminiscent of NOFX. Fat Mike of NOFX co-produced the album, and provides backing vocals on the second track of the album, Lazy.
==Production and composition==

Like its predecessor, &quot;Duh&quot;, &quot;Trashed&quot; was recorded at Westbeach Recorders in 1993 with producer Fat Mike. The album was also produced by the band themselves.

Discussing &quot;Know It All&quot;, guitarist Sean Dewey explained that it was &quot;constructive criticism, towards people who are involved in the whole scene and they like certain bands at certain times.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Trashed&quot; was released on January 4, 1994 through Fat Wreck Chords.

&quot;Trashed&quot; was also released in the same year as Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Dookie&quot;, Bad Religion’s &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;, NOFX&#x27;s &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;, and The Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot;, which are all widely considered to be the most important and successful albums of the 1990s California punk scene era. New York melodic hardcore punk band After the Fall has a song called &quot;1994&quot;, which mentions &quot;Trashed&quot; and other albums released that year. 1994 is from their 2009 album &quot;Fort Orange&quot;. &quot;Trashed&quot; includes a cover of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; on track 10.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover features scattered garbage, which references the album&#x27;s title. In the center of the trash is a photograph of the Lagwagon members wearing soccer uniforms with their band logo on the shirts. The 1979 AC/DC album &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; is seen at the top right of the cover. The back cover features a picture of the back of the band&#x27;s tour van, spray painted with the track names.

<text>Edward Bramwell Clarke (31 January 1874 – 28 April 1934) was an educator in Meiji period Japan, who is credited with introducing the sport of rugby to Japan.

==Early life==
Clarke was born at the treaty port of Yokohama, the son of a baker. He graduated with degrees in law and literature from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1899. Returning to Japan at the same year as an &quot;oyatoi gaikokujin&quot;, he received a post as an instructor in English language and English literature at Keio University in Tokyo. 

==Rugby in Japan==
Clarke wanted to give his students something constructive to do to keep them from idling and wasting &quot;the lovely autumn weather&quot;, and rugby which he had enjoyed as a student was what he decided to pass on to them. Together with fellow Cambridge alumni Tanaka Ginnosuke, he established a rugby union at Keio in 1899 and served as coach to the fledgling team.

On 7 December 1901 the members of the Keio Rugby Club, selected by Tanaka and Clarke, took part in the first rugby game with foreigners at Yokohama. Clarke that day played as full-back and Tanaka as stand-off. Clarke continued to coach rugby at Keio until 1907, after which an injury to his right leg complicated by rheumatism, led to its amputation.

In 1913, Clarke moved to a teaching post in Kyoto at the Third High School, and he became a professor of the literature department of Kyoto Imperial University in 1916. Clarke was an excellent academic and a prolific contributor to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, under the initials &quot;EB&quot;, and was in correspondence with Lafcadio Hearn. He continued to work at Kyoto Imperial University until his death in 1934 of an intracranial hemorrhage. His grave is at the Kobe Municipal Foreign Cemetery in Kobe, Japan.

<doc id="1279868" wikidata="Q7826399" url="?curid=1279868" title="Toronto Harbour">
<text>Toronto Harbour or Toronto Bay is a natural bay on the north shore of Lake Ontario, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Today, the harbour is used primarily for recreational boating, including personal vessels and pleasure boats providing scenic or party cruises. Ferries travel from docks on the mainland to the Islands, and cargo ships deliver aggregates and raw sugar to industries located in the harbour. Historically, the harbour has been used for military vessels, passenger traffic and cargo traffic. Waterfront uses include residential, recreational, cultural, commercial and industrial sites.

==Description==
There are two harbours: the original natural harbour, today named the &quot;Inner Harbour&quot;, and the &quot;Outer Harbour&quot;. Access into the Inner Harbour is made via either the Western Gap or Eastern Gap. The Don River drains into the Inner Harbour from the north-east, through the Keating Channel.

The makeup of the soil between the mainland and the island varies depending on the area of the harbour. Near the Western Gap (the western access point to Toronto&#x27;s Inner Harbour), the sediment is made up of stone, whereas sand makes up the sediment near Billy Bishop Island Airport, and the western parts of the Toronto Islands&#x27; north shore. Clay is more prominent in near the centre of the harbour, whereas the soil turns to mud near the north shore, towards the mouth of the Don River.

===Inner Harbour===
The Inner Harbour is used by pleasure boats and commercial vessels. The Port of Toronto is operated by PortsToronto and is located on the eastern shore of the harbour. The port consists of cargo facilities and the International Marine Passenger Terminal, a passenger ship dock on the eastern shore. The north shore has a mixed range of uses including Harbourfront, a conversion from industrial land to recreational and cultural uses. Harbourfront has parks, hotels, an amphitheatre, and many other facilities. The north shore retains one port-related industrial use, the Redpath Sugar Refinery, while most of the lands have been converted to other uses. The Jack Layton Ferry Terminal is located at the foot of Bay Street and pleasure and party cruise boats dock along the shore to the west of York Street. 

The Toronto Islands are a chain of small islands located just offshore from Downtown Toronto, providing shelter for the inner harbour. Most of the Islands is parkland, although it is also the site of several boat clubs, an amusement park, an airport, and a small residential area.

The Western Gap is a wide channel allowing western access to the Inner Harbour. The gap is deep enough (over 31 metres) to allow large ships (like lake freighters) to enter and exit into the Inner Harbour. The Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is located on the south side of the channel and is accessed by ferry and tunnel. Before the Western Gap was dug in 1910, the waterway was wide with a shallow sandy shoal surrounding what became Hanlan&#x27;s Point. The sands were deposited on either side of the new channel and are part of the airport lands.

The Eastern Gap is an approximately wide passage between Ward&#x27;s Island and the western edge of the Port Lands and used by most freighters to enter into the inner harbour and port facilities. The gap was first formed from 1852 to 1858 when storms caused a break in the sandy spit that connected the area with the mainland. 

Prior to the 1800s, small boat users had to use a portage on the western end of the sandy spit peninsula (thus requiring them to travel a short distance on land) from Lake Ontario to the inner harbour. After 1858, the Harbour Trust made the temporary channel into a permanent waterway.

===Outer Harbour===

Toronto also has a second harbour, referred to as the Outer Harbour. The City of Toronto&#x27;s Cherry Beach (formerly Clarke Beach Park), located on the north side of the Outer Harbour, is popular in summer. It typically meets high water quality, environmental and safety standards. A proposed Lake Ontario Park by Waterfront Toronto would pass through the Outer Harbour. The City of Toronto operates a marina in east end of the Harbour. Eight community water-sport clubs, forming the independent Outer Harbour Sailing Federation, share a small strip east of Cherry Beach Clarke Beach Park.

The harbour was developed in the 1950s and 1960s by the Toronto Harbour Commission through the construction of a new breakwater called the Outer Harbour East Headland. At that time, it was expected that there would be a great upswing in the number of ships calling at Toronto once the Saint Lawrence Seaway opened. However, the need for an extra harbour never materialized, and private boats are the only traffic usually found there now.

===Gaasyendietha===
Gaasyendietha is a legendary Loch Ness Monster-type creature and it is sometimes spotted in Lake Ontario and even within the Toronto Harbour. The story of Gaasyendietha is a Native Canadian myth from the Seneca tribe.

==History==
The original shoreline of the northern shore was low sandy bluffs, just south of today&#x27;s Front Street. The mouth of the harbour pointed west. The islands used to be a low sandy peninsula forming the southern limit of the bay. The Scarborough Bluffs are much larger bluffs that lie approximately east of the harbour. Strong lake currents over time washed the sand eroded from the bluffs westwards to form the peninsula surrounding the bay. The eastern shore of the bay, approximately six kilometres east, was a marsh around the mouth of the Don River. In addition to the Don River, a number of smaller creeks flowed into the bay. The original site of the town of York had half a dozen short creeks that flowed through it.

The town of York was established in 1793 in a ten-block rectangle bounded by the present Front Street, Berkeley, Duke (now Adelaide) and George Street alongside Taddle Creek. A government wharf was built to handle the transfer of ships&#x27; cargoes. A garrison at the entrance to the harbour, at the mouth of Garrison Creek, was established to guard the harbour along with a blockhouse on the island. In 1801, York became an official port-of-entry for immigrants and cargo. In 1808, the Gibraltar Point lighthouse was built on the island to guide ships.

In the early 19th century, cargoes destined for York would be transferred at Montreal to smaller boats such as Durham boats and batteaux to traverse the rapids of the St. Lawrence River. Although not fully established by the War of 1812, the British colonial army was determined to set up boat-building for the defences at York. Fort York, on the north shore of the bay, near the mouth of Garrison Creek, guarded the harbour&#x27;s mouth. An armed schooner was under construction at the York Naval Shipyards when the Americans attacked and the British burned the hull rather than surrender it. The invaders occupied Fort York, looted the town and destroyed military facilities.

In 1825, the Lachine Canal was built to bypass the Lachine Rapids. Some of the boats used for cargo were now being built at Toronto Bay. By the time of the establishment of the Town of Toronto, three large wharves existed for shipping, King&#x27;s Wharf at Peter Street, Cooper&#x27;s Wharf at Church Street and Merchant&#x27;s Wharf at Caroline Street (today&#x27;s Sherbourne Street). The new Queen&#x27;s Wharf, at the foot of Bathurst Street, was constructed in two stages, eventually reaching in length. Commissioned by the Province of Upper Canada, it cost £4,500. The first harbourmaster of Toronto, Hugh Richardson, was named in 1833. Richardson held the position until 1870. While the Queen&#x27;s Wharf no longer exists, the Queen&#x27;s Wharf Lighthouse still exists, eventually moved to a location off today&#x27;s Lake Shore Boulevard in 1929. In 1849, the &quot;Harbour Trust&quot; was formed to manage the port and the Queen&#x27;s Wharf.

In 1832, the Gooderham and Worts Distillery went into operation, using a windmill on the Toronto waterfront, near the Don River, to provide power. The Distillery had been conceived as a plant to make flour, but the distillery business was much more popular. By 1837, the mill was producing more than of whiskey annually.

By 1840, the entire waterfront was populated with government and merchant wharves. The &quot;Esplanade&quot;, a -wide road, was proposed, just south of Front Street, with new water lots made from cribbing and filling of the shore to the south. The waterfront was extended to a survey line from the point of the Gooderham windmill west to a point due east of the old Fort Rouillé. Ostensibly for carriages and carts, the roadway eventually became primarily the route for rail lines in the central core. In exchange for of the Esplanade, the railways underwrote the infilling of the harbour. The Esplanade and infill project was complete by 1865. A section of The Esplanade from Yonge Street to Berkeley Street still exists as a roadway and park. The rail lines moved to a viaduct in the 20th century.

The harbour saw increased activity in the 1840s. Harbour dues increased by 25 per cent between 1843 and 1844 alone. This saw an increase in the number of ships using the harbour. Donald Bethune operated a fleet of eight steamships out of Toronto harbour.

The peninsula became the Toronto Islands through the result of two storms and man-made activity. In 1852, a storm created a channel through the eastern edge of the peninsula that formed the south edge of the bay. The storm washed through excavations made for sand for local construction. In 1858, another storm widened the channel and made it permanent.

The first rail line to the harbour was the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railroad in 1853. The next rail line was the Grand Trunk, which underwrote the Esplanade project in exchange for an easement to enter the City. The Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in 1886, through the purchase of the Credit Valley Railway. Most of the area along the shoreline was connected to the railways. Manufacturers of products such as soap received raw materials via boat, produced the product at their location on the harbour, and distributed it via rail.

As well as cargo, the harbour also became a major passenger waypoint. By the 1880s, the harbour was handling 1,250,000 passengers annually through passenger steamship docks at the foot of Yonge Street. Passenger boats operated on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Excursions to Niagara also departed from the Yonge Street docks.
The western channel&#x27;s depth was found to be too shallow by 1906 when the steam barge &quot;Resolute&quot; sank outside the harbour during a storm. The barge was unable to shelter in the harbour. The Queen&#x27;s Wharf area was rebuilt during the years of 1908 to 1911 by the federal government. The existing channel could not be dredged to a lower depth, as its bottom was solid rock, so a new, deeper, western channel was dug to the south of the existing one. The sand removed for the new channel created a total of of new land, split evenly to the north and the south of the new channel. The Queen&#x27;s Wharf site became the eventual site of the Loblaws warehouse at the intersection of Bathurst Street and Fleet Street. The rebuilding of the Loblaws warehouse in the 2010s uncovered an old boat, left in the landfill when the Queen&#x27;s Wharf area was filled in.

The 1910 Toronto Board of Trade proposal for the Ashbridge&#x27;s Bay was for an industrial district for industrial offices and sites served by railway lines, public warehouses alongside docking facilities south of Keating Channel to the Eastern Gap and parkland/recreational strip at the south end. In 1911, the Toronto Harbour Commission was created. The lands of the waterfront that were owned by the City of Toronto were transferred to the Commission to administer. In 1912, the commission delivered its first plan for the harbour and the waterfront from the Humber River in the west, to Woodbine Avenue to the east. The Commission dredged the harbour to a depth of to match the new Welland Canal.

As the city of Toronto grew the northern shore of the bay was further altered by landfill, and has been moved approximately south. After the Esplanade landfill, the second landfill project in 1910 filled the water lots, which extended the shoreline south of today&#x27;s Lake Shore Boulevard, providing room for the Terminal Warehouse, the Toronto Harbour Commission Building and other facilities along the new Queen&#x27;s Quay. The final infill on the north shore was in the 1950s, from Yonge Street east to the Don River, providing room for the Redpath Sugar Refinery, the Victory Soy Mills and several marine terminals.

In the 1920s, most of the low-lying marsh of Ashbridge&#x27;s Bay was filled in to create Toronto&#x27;s inner harbour area (with the small section to the east and the shipping channel the only reminder of the body of water). In the 1930s, the waters of Hanlan&#x27;s Bay on the western point of the islands were infilled to create the Toronto Island Airport.

By the time that the plans to build the St. Lawrence Seaway were announced, commercial usage of the harbour was already in decline. The previous infill on the eastern side created in the 1920s was used to build modern port facilities. In the 1970s, the northern shore was in decline and there was a new political initiative to rebuild the waterfront without industry in a manner seen in other cities. The Harbourfront project expropriated the lands west of York Street. Several facilities were renovated, such as the Terminal Warehouse, and others were demolished, creating space for recreational and cultural uses. The area around Yonge Street remained in private possession and a hotel and condominiums were built on the shoreline. The area east of Yonge Street remained in light industrial use under public possession. On the north side of the harbour, there are a few buildings left from the industrial period. Some are in use, such as the Redpath Sugar Refinery. Others have been demolished or are slated for demolition, including grain storage elevators at the east and west end of the inner harbour.

Starting in 1972, the Government of Canada spent ($ in dollars) to dredge and widen the Eastern Gap, making it the primary entrance to the harbour for commercial boats. The of material was used to build the aquatic park on the Outer Harbour headland.

In June 2004, the company Canadian American Transportation Systems (CATS) began regular passenger/vehicle ferry service between Pier 52 and Rochester, New York using the vessel &quot;Spirit of Ontario I&quot;. The service used a marketing name called &quot;The Breeze&quot;. While Rochester had a custom-built ferry terminal, the Toronto terminal was a temporary facility, near the end of Cherry Street for security and customs screening facilities while a permanent marine passenger terminal was still under consideration for construction. CATS discontinued the service after only 11 weeks; among the problems cited was the absence of a permanent marine passenger terminal in Toronto and little Canadian interest in the service. The vessel was sold in a bankruptcy sale in February 2005 to Rochester Ferry Company LLC, a subsidiary of the City of Rochester. In April 2005, Rochester Ferry Company LLC announced that the Rochester-Toronto ferry service using &quot;Spirit of Ontario I&quot; would return, operated by Bay Ferries Great Lakes Limited and using the marketing name &quot;The Cat&quot;. The Toronto Port Authority officially opened the International Marine Passenger Terminal on June 27, 2005, three days before ferry service resumed. Even with impressive passenger numbers by the winter of 2006 the ferry service lost funding from the City of Rochester and announced that it would no longer be in business. The terminal building was later used for filming the CBC crime drama &quot;The Border&quot;.

In 2018, Waterfront Toronto began construction on the Don River Mouth Naturalization, which will create another outlet for the Don River into Toronto Harbour. Essroc pier has been demolished and Polson Pier will be demolished. The bank on the harbour in these areas will be turned into parkland. A regulatory flood channel will spill into the Ship Channel. The project will be completed in 2024.

The original area of the harbour in 1834 was estimated to be about . With infilling, the area has declined to an area of in size.

==Quays and wharves==

Wharves existed along Toronto&#x27;s waterfront in the 19th century, but they have since been replaced by quays. Most of the former wharves disappeared when the waterfront was filled in along with the now &quot;missing&quot; creeks of Toronto.

<doc id="1279880" wikidata="Q535297" url="?curid=1279880" title="Rationing in the United Kingdom">
<text>Rationing was introduced temporarily by the British government several times during the 20th century, during and immediately after a war.

At the start of the Second World War in 1939, the United Kingdom was importing 20 million long tons of food per year, including about 70% of its cheese and sugar, almost 80% of fruit and about 70% of cereals and fats. The UK also imported more than half of its meat and relied on imported feed to support its domestic meat production. The civilian population of the country was about 50 million. It was one of the principal strategies of the Germans in the Battle of the Atlantic to attack shipping bound for Britain, restricting British industry and potentially starving the nation into submission.

To deal with sometimes extreme shortages, the Ministry of Food instituted a system of rationing. To buy most rationed items, each person had to register at chosen shops and was provided with a ration book containing coupons. The shopkeeper was provided with enough food for registered customers. Purchasers had to present ration books when shopping so that the coupon or coupons could be cancelled as these pertained to rationed items. Rationed items had to be purchased and paid for as usual, although their price was strictly controlled by the government and many essential foodstuffs were subsidised; rationing restricted what items and what amount could be purchased as well as what they would cost. Items that were not rationed could be scarce. Prices of some unrationed items were also controlled; prices for many items not controlled were unaffordably high for most people.

During the Second World War rationing—not restricted to food—was part of a strategy including controlled prices, subsidies and government-enforced standards, with the goals of managing scarcity and prioritising the armed forces and essential services, and trying to make available to everyone an adequate and affordable supply of goods of acceptable quality.

==First World War 1914–1918==


In line with its business as usual policy during the First World War, the government was initially reluctant to try to control the food markets. It fought off attempts to introduce minimum prices in cereal production, though relenting in the area of control of essential imports (sugar, meat, and grains). When it did introduce changes, they were limited. In 1916, it became illegal to consume more than two courses while lunching in a public eating place or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the public found feeding the pigeons or stray animals.

In January 1917, Germany started unrestricted submarine warfare to try to starve Britain into submission. To meet this threat, voluntary rationing was introduced in February 1917. Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by local authorities taking matters into their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between December 1917 and February 1918 as Britain&#x27;s supply of wheat decreased to just six weeks&#x27; consumption. To help the process, ration books were introduced in July 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar. Each consumer was tied to a retailer. The basic ration of sugar, butter or margarine, tea, jam, bacon and meat came to about 1,680 calories. It was adjusted for vegetarians, children and workers performing strenuous labour. Nutritional programmes for nursing mothers and young children were established by many local authorities. Unlike most of Europe bread was not rationed. It was argued that the civilian population&#x27;s health improved under rationing, though tuberculosis increased. During the war, average energy intake decreased by only 3%, but protein intake by 6%. Controls were not fully released until 1921.

== General strike of 1926 ==
The government made preparations to ration food in 1925, in advance of an expected general strike, and appointed Food Control Officers for each region. In the event, the trade unions of the London docks organised blockades by crowds, but convoys of lorries under military escort took the heart out of the strike, so that the measures did not have to be implemented.

==Second World War 1939–1945==
=== Food rationing ===

Emergency supplies for the 4 million people expected to be evacuated were delivered to destination centres by August 1939, and 50 million ration books were already printed and distributed.

When World War II began in September 1939, petrol was the first commodity to be controlled. On 8 January 1940, bacon, butter, and sugar were rationed. Meat, tea, jam, biscuits, breakfast cereals, cheese, eggs, lard, milk, canned and dried fruit were rationed subsequently, though not all at once. In June 1942, the Combined Food Board was set up by the United Kingdom and the United States to coordinate the world supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. Almost all foods apart from vegetables and bread were rationed by August 1942. Strict rationing created a black market. Almost all controlled items were rationed by weight; but meat was rationed by price.

===Fruits and vegetables===

Fresh vegetables and fruit were not rationed, but supplies were limited. Some types of imported fruit all but disappeared. Lemons and bananas became unobtainable for most of the war; oranges continued to be sold, but greengrocers customarily reserved them for children and pregnant women. Apples were available from time to time.

Many grew their own vegetables, encouraged by the &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; campaign. In 1942, many young children, questioned about bananas, did not believe they were real. A popular music-hall song, written 20 years previously but sung ironically, was &quot;Yes! We Have No Bananas&quot;.

===Game===

Game meat such as rabbit and pigeon was not rationed. Some British biologists ate laboratory rats.

===Bread===
Bread was not rationed until after the war ended, but the &quot;national loaf&quot; of wholemeal bread replaced the white variety. It was found to be mushy, grey and easy to blame for digestion problems. There were four permitted loaves and slicing and wrapping were not permitted.

===Fish===

Fish was not rationed, but prices increased considerably as the war progressed. The government did not ration fish, because fishermen, at risk from enemy attack and mines, had to be paid a premium for their catch in order to fish at all. Prices were controlled from 1941. Like other foods, fish was seldom available in abundance. During the war, the Royal Navy requisitioned hundreds of trawlers for military use, leaving primarily smaller vessels thought less likely to be targeted by Axis forces to fish. Supplies eventually dropped to 30% of pre-war levels. Wartime fish and chips was often felt to be below standard because of the low-quality fat available for frying.

===Honey===

Due to the vital role beekeeping played in British agriculture and industry, special allotments of sugar were allowed for each hive. In 1943, the Ministry of Food announced that beekeepers would qualify for supplies of sugar not exceeding ten pounds per colony to keep their beehives going through the winter, and five pounds for spring feeding. Honey was not rationed, but its price was controlled - as with other unrationed, domestically produced produce, sellers imposed their own restrictions.

===Alcohol===

All drinks except beer were scarce. Beer was considered a vital foodstuff as it was a morale booster. Brewers were short of labour and suffered from the scarcity of imported barley. A ban on importing sugar for brewing and racking made beer strengths weaker.

===Fuel===

On 13 March 1942 the abolition of the basic petrol ration was announced, effective from the 1 July (Ivor Novello, a prominent British public figure in the entertainment industry, was sent to prison for four weeks for misusing petrol coupons). Thenceforth, vehicle fuel was only available to official users, such as the emergency services, bus companies and farmers. The priority users of fuel were always the armed forces. Fuel supplied to approved users was dyed, and use of this fuel for non-essential purposes was an offence.

===Subsidies===

In addition to rationing and price controls, the government equalised the food supply through subsidies on items consumed by the poor and the working class. In 1942–43, £145 million was spent on food subsidies, including £35 million on bread, flour and oatmeal, £23 million on meat and the same on potatoes, £11 million on milk, and £13 million on eggs.

===Restaurants===
Restaurants were initially exempt from rationing but this was resented because of the public perception that &quot;luxury&quot; off-ration foodstuffs were being unfairly obtained by those who could afford to dine regularly in restaurants. In May 1942, the Ministry of Food issued new restrictions on restaurants:
* Meals were limited to three courses; only one component dish could contain fish or game or poultry (but not more than one of these)
* In general, no meals could be served between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. without a special licence
* The maximum price of a meal was 5 shillings (). Extra charges allowed for cabaret shows and luxury hotels.

===Public catering===


About 2,000 new wartime establishments called British Restaurants were run by local authorities in schools and church halls. Here, a plain three-course meal cost only 9d () and no ration coupons were required. They evolved from the London County Council&#x27;s &quot;Londoners&#x27; Meals Service&quot;, which began as an emergency system for feeding people who had had their houses bombed and could no longer live in them. They were open to all and mostly served office and industrial workers.

Cooking depots were set up in Sheffield and Plymouth, providing roast dinners, stew and pudding. Hot sweet tea was often distributed after bombing raids.

=== Health effects ===
In December 1939, Elsie Widdowson and Robert McCance of the University of Cambridge tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if U-boats ended all imports. Using 1938 food production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers one egg, of meat and of fish a week; of milk a day; of margarine; and unlimited amounts of potatoes, vegetables and wholemeal bread. Two weeks of intensive outdoor exercise simulated the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects&#x27; health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a &quot;remarkable&quot; increase in flatulence from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their faeces had increased by 250% in volume.

The resultskept secret until after the wargave the government confidence that, if necessary, food could be distributed equally to all, including high-value war workers, without causing widespread health problems. Britons&#x27; actual wartime diet was never as severe as in the Cambridge study because imports from the United States avoided the U-boats, but rationing improved the health of British people; infant mortality declined and life expectancy rose, excluding deaths caused by hostilities. This was because it ensured that everyone had access to a varied diet with enough vitamins. Blackcurrant syrup and later American bottled orange juice was provided free for children under 2, and those under 5 and expectant mothers got subsidised milk. Consumption of fat and sugar declined while consumption of milk and fibre increased.

=== Standard food rationing during the Second World War ===
The standard rations during the Second World War were as follows. Quantities are &quot;per week&quot; unless otherwise stated.

=== Food rations ===

=== Army and Merchant Navy rations ===

1s 2d bought about of meat. Offal and sausages were rationed only from 1942 to 1944. When sausages were not rationed, the meat needed to make them was so scarce that they often contained a high proportion of bread. Eggs were rationed and &quot;allocated to ordinary [citizens] as available&quot;; in 1944 thirty allocations of one egg each were made. Children and some invalids were allowed three a week; expectant mothers two on each allocation.
* 1 egg per week or 1 packet (makes 12 ersatz eggs) of egg powder per month (vegetarians were allowed two eggs)
* plus, 24 points for four weeks for tinned and dried food.

Arrangements were made for vegetarians so that other goods were substituted for their rations of meat.

Milk was supplied at each week with priority for expectant mothers and children under 5; for those under 18; children unable to attend school , certain invalids up to . Each person received one tin of milk powder (equivalent to ) every eight weeks.

=== Special civilian rations ===
Persons falling within the following descriptions were allowed of cheese a week in place of the general ration of :
* vegetarians (meat and bacon coupons must be surrendered)
* underground mine workers
* agricultural workers holding unemployment insurance books or cards bearing stamps marked &quot;Agriculture&quot;
* county roadmen
* forestry workers (including fellers and hauliers)
* land drainage workers (including Catchment Board workers)
* members of the Auxiliary Force of the Women&#x27;s Land Army
* railway train crews (including crews of shunting engines but not including dining car staffs)
* railway signalmen and permanent way men who have no access to canteen facilities
* certain types of agricultural industry workers (workers employed on threshing machines, tractor workers who are not included in the Agricultural Unemployment Insurance Stamp Scheme, hay pressers and trussers).

=== Weekly supplementary allowances of rationed foods for invalids ===
=== Non-food rations ===
====Clothing====
As the war progressed, rationing was extended to other consumable commodities including clothing, which was controlled on a system of points allocated to different garments.

Following the depletion of raw materials and redirection of labour towards wartime manufactures (such as uniforms), alongside rising inflation, and the inclusion of purchase tax on clothing in October 1940, prices of garments and textiles increased. As a result, civilian access to clothing was tightening. Government regulation was required in order to ensure the ability to buy clothing was maintained across the civilian population.

The rationing of cloth, clothing, and footwear was introduced in June 1941, and remained in place until March 1949. Clothes rationing also aimed to restrict the amount of new clothes the public could buy, and therefore reduce the amount of clothing produced for civilians.

Reported in local and national newspapers, clothes rationing came as a surprise to the public, in order to avoid panic-buying. Coupons were to be presented on purchase of clothing, shoes, and fabrics alongside cash payment. Until the issuing of Clothing Coupon books for 1942-43, consumers were to surrender unused margarine coupons from their food ration coupon book when buying clothing. Initially people were allocated 66 points for clothing per year; in 1942, this was cut to 48, in 1943 to 36, and in 1945–1946 to 24. 

Different types of clothes were ascribed different coupon values, determined by how much material and labour went into each item&#x27;s manufacture. For example, an adult&#x27;s skirt would require seven coupons and a pair of child&#x27;s pyjamas six coupons. As well as being used for clothing, coupons could be used for wool, cotton and household textiles. Clothing sized for children under the age of four did not require coupons for purchase.

The prices of second-hand clothing and fur coats were fixed, but no coupons were required to buy them. People were allocated extra coupons for work clothes, such as overalls for factory work. Manual workers, civilian uniform wearers, diplomats, performers and new mothers also received extra coupons.

Garments of the same description but different quality would have different prices but require the same number of coupons; the more affordable clothing would often be less robust and wear out sooner, even with repair. This, therefore, led the Government to implement the Utility Clothing Scheme in September 1941, which was introduced alongside other measures, such as the civilian population being encouraged to repair and remake old clothes; pamphlets were produced by the Ministry of Information with the slogan &quot;Make Do and Mend&quot; in 1943 which gave ideas and instruction as part of a larger campaign which was put in place through collaboration with voluntary organisations.

Clothes rationing ended on 15 March 1949.

====Soap====
All types of soap were rationed. Coupons were allotted by weight or (if liquid) by quantity. In 1945, the ration gave four coupons each month; babies and some workers and invalids were allowed more. A coupon would yield:
* bar hard soap
* bar toilet soap
* No. 1 liquid soap
* soft soap
* soap flakes
* powdered soap

====Fuel====
The Fuel and Lighting (Coal) Order 1941 came into force in January 1942. Central heating was prohibited in the summer months. Domestic coal was rationed to for those in London and the south of England; for the rest (the southern part of England having generally a milder climate). Some kinds of coal such as anthracite were not rationed, and in coal-mining areas waste coal was eagerly gathered, as it had been in the Great Depression.

====Petrol====
Petrol rationing was introduced in September 1939 with an allowance of approximately of motoring per month. The coupons issued related to a car&#x27;s calculated RAC horsepower and that horsepower&#x27;s nominal fuel consumption. From July 1942 until June 1945, the basic ration was suspended completely, with essential-user coupons being issued only to those with official sanction. In June 1945, the basic ration was restored to allow about per month; this was increased in August 1945 to allow about per month.

====Paper====
Newspapers were limited from September 1939, at first to 60% of their pre-war consumption of newsprint. Paper supply came under the No 48 Paper Control Order, 4 September 1942, and was controlled by the Ministry of Production. By 1945, newspapers were limited to 25% of their pre-war consumption. Wrapping paper for most goods was prohibited.

The paper shortage often made it more difficult than usual for authors to get work published. In 1944, George Orwell wrote:

==== Other products ====
Whether rationed or not, many personal-use goods became difficult to obtain because of the shortage of components. Examples included razor blades, baby bottles, alarm clocks, frying pans and pots. Balloons and sugar for cakes for birthday parties were partially or completely unavailable. Couples had to use a mock cardboard and plaster wedding cake in lieu of a real tiered wedding cake, with a smaller cake hidden in the mock cake. Houseplants were impossible to get and people used carrot tops instead. Many fathers saved bits of wood to build toys for Christmas presents, and Christmas trees were almost impossible to obtain due to timber rationing.

== Post-Second World War 1945–1954 ==
On 8 May 1945, the Second World War ended in Europe, but rationing continued for several years afterwards. Some aspects of rationing became stricter than they were during the war. Bread was rationed from 21 July 1946 to 24 July 1948. Average body weight fell and potato consumption increased. Certain foodstuffs that the average 1940s British citizen would find unusual, for example whale meat and canned snoek fish from South Africa, were not rationed. Despite this, they did not prove popular. In 1950, 4000 tonnes of whale meat went unsold on Tyneside.

When sweets were taken off ration in April 1949 (but sugar was still rationed), there was, understandably, a rush on sweetshops, and rationing had to be reintroduced in August, remaining until 1953. At the time, this was presented as necessary to feed people in European areas under British control, whose economies had been devastated by the fighting. This was partly true, but with many British men still mobilised in the armed forces, an austere economic climate, a centrally-planned economy under the post-war Labour government and the curtailment of American assistance (in particular, the closure of the Combined Food Board in 1946), resources were not available to expand food production and food imports. Frequent strikes by some workers (most critically dock workers) made things worse.

A common ration book fraud was the ration books of the dead being kept and used by the living.

=== Political reaction ===
In the late 1940s, the Conservative Party used and encouraged growing public anger at rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity and government bureaucracy to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won the 1951 general election. Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.

=== Timeline ===

==== 1945 ====
* 27 May: Bacon ration cut from per week. Cooking fat ration cut from per week. Soap ration cut by an eighth, except for babies and young children. The referenced newspaper article predicted that households would be grossly hampered in making food items that included pastry.
* 1 June: The basic petrol ration for civilians was restored.
* 19 July: In order to preserve the egalitarian nature of rationing, gift food parcels from overseas weighing more than would be deducted from the recipient&#x27;s ration.

==== 1946 ====
* Summer: Continual rain ruined Britain&#x27;s wheat crop. Bread and flour rationing started.

==== 1947 ====
* January–March: Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom: long hard frost and deep snow. Frost destroyed a huge amount of stored potatoes. Potato rationing started.
* Mid-year: A transport and dock strike, which among other effects caused much loss of imported meat left to rot on the docks, until the Army broke the strike. The basic petrol ration was stopped.

==== 1948 ====
* 1 June: The Motor Spirit (Regulation) Act 1948 was passed, ordering a red dye to be to put into some petrol, and that red petrol was only allowed to be used in commercial vehicles. A private car driver could lose their driving licence for a year if red petrol was found in their car. A petrol station could be shut down if it sold red petrol to a private car driver.
* June: The basic petrol ration was restored, but only allowed about 90 miles per month.
* Bread came off ration.

====1949====
* May 1949: Clothes rationing ended. According to one author, this was because attempts to enforce it were defeated by continual massive illegality (black market, unofficial trade in loose clothing coupons (many forged), bulk thefts of unissued clothes ration books).
* June, July and August 1949: The basic petrol ration was temporarily increased to allow about 180 miles per month.

====1950====
* 23 February 1950: 1950 general election fought largely on the issue of rationing. The Conservative Party campaigned on a manifesto of ending rationing as quickly as possible. The Labour Party argued for the continuation of rationing indefinitely. Labour was returned, but with its majority badly slashed to 5 seats.
* March 1950: The Ministry of Fuel and Power announced that the petrol ration would again be doubled for the months of June, July and August.
* April 1950: The Ministry of Fuel and Power announced that the petrol ration would be doubled for 12 months from 1 June.
* 26 May 1950: Petrol rationing ended.

====1951====
* 25 October 1951: 1951 United Kingdom general election. The Conservatives came back into power.

====1953====
* 4 February 1953: Confectionery (sweets and chocolate) rationing ended.
* September 1953: Sugar rationing ended.
====1954====
* 4 July 1954: Meat and all other food rationing ended in Britain.

Although rationing formally ended in 1954, cheese production was affected for decades afterwards. During rationing, most milk in Britain was used to make one kind of cheese, nicknamed Government Cheddar (not to be confused with the government cheese issued by the US welfare system). This wiped out nearly all other cheese production in the country, and some indigenous varieties of cheese almost disappeared. Later government controls on milk prices through the Milk Marketing Board continued to discourage production of other varieties of cheese until well into the 1980s, and it was only in the mid-1990s (following the effective abolition of the MMB) that the revival of the British cheese industry began in earnest.

====1958====
* Coal rationing ends in July.

== Suez Crisis 1956–1957 ==
During the Suez Crisis, petrol rationing was briefly reintroduced and ran from 17 December 1956 until 14 May 1957. Advertising of petrol on the recently introduced ITV was banned for a period.

==Oil crises of 1973 and 1979==

Petrol coupons were issued for a short time as preparation for the possibility of petrol rationing during the 1973 oil crisis. The rationing never came about, in large part because increasing North Sea oil production allowed the UK to offset much of the lost imports. By the time of the 1979 energy crisis, the United Kingdom had become a net exporter of oil, so on that occasion the government did not even have to consider petrol rationing.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Nguema Abessolo, also seen as J.-B. Abessolo-Nguema, (born 15 February 1932) is an educator and writer from Gabon.

Born at Oyem, he was educated there and at Libreville, then studied educational administration at École des Cadres Superieures in Brazzaville and the École Normale Supérieure at Mouyondzi.

He was a school administrator and inspector of primary schools from 1952 to 1982, interrupted only by a year in Paris (1960–61). In December 1982 he became director-general of the International Center for Bantu Civilizations in Libreville.

Abessole has published a number of short stories in both Gabon and France.

<text>Taddle Creek is a buried stream in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that flowed a southeasterly course about six kilometres long, from St. Clair Avenue west of Bathurst Street through the present site of Wychwood Park, through the University of Toronto, into the Toronto Harbour near the Distillery District. During the 19th century, it was buried and converted into an underground sewer, but traces of the creek can still be found today. The scenic footpath known as Philosopher&#x27;s Walk follows the ravine created by the creek from the Royal Ontario Museum to Trinity College. &quot;Taddle Creek&quot; is also the name of a Toronto literary magazine and of a local Montessori school.

==History==

In the 1790s, the original town site of the Town of York was established along its south bank. Its waters would be used by its first industries. The disappearance of the creek came in phases in the 19th century:
* east of Church Street - before 1860
* Elizabeth Street to Church Street - early 1866
* University of Toronto sections including McCaul&#x27;s Pond - 1886

There is no exact origin for the creek&#x27;s name but there are three possible theories:
* named for the Tattle family of Toronto
* named for the tadpoles that filled the creek
* onomatopoeic link of an English northcountry dialect variant of &quot;toddle&quot; meaning &quot;to move with a gentle sound, as a stream or river&quot;

Taddle Creek had other names during the 19th Century:
* Little Don River
* Brewery Creek - named for Enoch Turner&#x27;s brewery
* Goodwin Creek
* University Creek
* Wolz Creek - east of Jarvis after brewer John Wolz (or Walz)

<text>The Rodovia dos Imigrantes (official designation SP-160) is a highway in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The highway connects the city of São Paulo to the Atlantic coast and with the seaside cities of São Vicente and Praia Grande. It follows the route of the Rodovia Anchieta and is also one of Brazil&#x27;s busiest highways, especially on weekends.

The Rodovia dos Imigrantes has 44 viaducts, seven bridges, and 11 tunnels, along its 58.5 km stretch. The highway has recently been expanded, in one of the most audacious feats of Brazilian highway engineering, with extremely long tunnels and high strutting six-lane bridges constructed over the tropical rain forest, which covers the steep faces of the Serra do Mar, the cliff range that separates the São Paulo plateau from the seaside lowlands. During sunny weekends, more than one million automobiles commonly cross its near 60 km run, separating the city of São Paulo from the sea.

The Rodovia dos Imigrantes was inaugurated on Monday, 28 June 1976, by President Ernesto Geisel, due to traffic saturation on the Rodovia Anchieta. Although longer than the Anchieta, the Imigrantes is nowadays busier due to its building standards, which permit higher speed limits, and its more direct path to the cities of Santos and Guarujá, the northern coast (with Bertioga), as well as the southern coast (with cities Praia Grande, Mongaguá, and Itanhaém). Its south lane was inaugurated on Tuesday, 17 December 2002.

Meaning &quot;immigrants&#x27; highway&quot; in Portuguese, the Rodovia dos Imigrantes was so named as a way to remember the contribution of immigrants to the cultural, economic, and social development of Brazil.

It is managed by a state concession to the private company, Ecovias, which also maintains the Rodovia Anchieta; it is, therefore, a toll road.

The two carriageways of the Rodovia dos Imigrantes are both fully reversible and traffic is managed to flow either bidirectionally (uphill on one carriageway and downhill on the other) or unidirectionally (uphill or downhill on both carriageways), depending on demand. In the unidirectional mode, the opposing traffic is diverted to the Rodovia Anchieta.

==Directions==
The path of the Immigrant Road crosses the following municipalities, all in the state of São Paulo: São Paulo, Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Cubatão, São Vicente and Praia Grande.

==Tolls==
The Rodovia dos Imigrantes has been tolled since its inauguration. As in all the highways that suffered concessions, the tolls of the Imigrantes suffered strong readjustments, even after discounting inflation, considered excessive by significant users.
Currently, the toll of the Imigrantes is the most expensive in the state, at R$ 35.30, valid for a round trip by car. In the stretch of plateau, the Imigrantes presents three tolls of blockade to the access to the bordering localities.

<doc id="1279907" wikidata="Q16962957" url="?curid=1279907" title="Australian Gas Light Company">
<text>The Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) was an Australian gas and electricity retailer. It was formed in Sydney in 1837 and supplied town gas for the first public lighting of a street lamp in Sydney in 1841. AGL was the second company to list on the Sydney Stock Exchange. The company gradually diversified into electricity and into a number of different locations. After a combination of a merger and demerger with Alinta in 2006, it was replaced by AGL Energy.

==History==
In 1837, AGL was given a royal charter charged with the responsibility of lighting Sydney&#x27;s streets. The lights were lit on 24 May 1841 to celebrate the birthday of Queen Victoria. Town gas was first stored in holder tanks hewn out of solid sandstone at Darling Harbour. Later, a large gas works at Mortlake supplied gas which was used over an area of 600 square kilometres and piped up to 25 kilometres away. The Mortlake Ferry was constructed with the express purpose of delivering workers who lived on the north side of the harbour to their workplace. By 1925, the company was the seventh largest gas undertaking in the British Empire.

In 1976, AGL converted from town gas to natural gas following the opening of the Moomba to Sydney Pipeline. In the later part of the 20th century, the company diversified into electricity generation, buying a stake in the Loy Yang Power Station and ownership of the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme, the Wattle Point Wind Farm, and a peak load gas-powered power station near Hallett in South Australia. The company also had significant ownership of gas pipelines plus electricity and gas distribution networks in Australia.

In late 2006, AGL merged with Alinta and then demerged to create separate retail and infrastructure companies. The transactions were executed on 25 October 2006 via two schemes of arrangement, resulting in a revised Alinta holding both companies’ combined infrastructure and asset management businesses, and AGL Energy, which holds AGL’s energy business as well as approximately one third of Alinta’s West Australian retail and cogeneration business (AlintaAGL).

<doc id="1279910" wikidata="Q6250661" url="?curid=1279910" title="John Northampton">
<text>John Northampton (also known as John Comberton) (died 1398) was a reformist Lord Mayor of London in 1381 and 1382, during dissension in favour of reform of its Common Council in the early years of Richard II&#x27;s reign. When the oligarchic leaders of London were able to engineer the overthrow of his faction, even the book of records of reform legislation was burned, known as the Jubilee Book. The radical movements&#x27; mob politics heightened public reluctance to permit people&#x27;s engagement in politics.

He had also served as Sheriff of London in 1376-77.

==Family==
Northampton was raised in London, son of Thomas and Mariota Northampton. He is known to have had two brothers, William and Robert, and two sisters, Petronilla and Agnes.

He was twice married. His first wife, living in 1371, was named Johanna, his second, to whom he was married by 1375, Petronilla, daughter of John Preston and Margaret Constantine (also spelt Constantyn). By one of those marriages he left a son named James.

Northampton became alternatively known as John Comberton in the writings of chroniclers playing on the word &quot;comber&quot; (trouble) in reflection of the trouble that opponents thought his policies caused London.

==Career to 1383==
Northampton came early into business in the city, being named as one of four &#x27;upholders&#x27; of the Drapers&#x27; Guild in 1361. Outside his work he may have gained a turbulent reputation for he was bound over the keep the peace and refrain from affrays in the streets in 1365, 1369 and 1371.

He entered city politics in the Common Council as Alderman for the Cordwainer Street Ward from 1375 to 1377, and became Sheriff of the city in 1376. He became leader of the faction in the city that supported John of Gaunt and John Wycliffe, in contrast to the other party led by William Walworth and John Philipot who supported the opposition to Gaunt.

Following the Good Parliament of 1376, he was one of a cohort of Londoners who ousted Richard Lyons and others from city offices and introduced the rule that Common Council members be chosen according to craft guild affiliations rather than by city ward. In 1378 he was elected as Member of Parliament for the City in that year&#x27;s parliament.

He served two terms as Lord Mayor from 1381 to 1383, characterized by measures to help London&#x27;s less prosperous citizens. He was opposed to the monopoly of the fishmongers, and broke this by enacting ordinances to open the markets to non-resident tradesmen and forbidding the wholesale purchase of fish for profit. He later applied such measures to trade in bread, ale, wine and poultry. He increased the circulation of farthings by reminting £80 into 76,000 coins, ordered bakers to make farthing measures of bread for sale, and ordered that traders, mass priests and others accept payments in the coin or give their services free. There were also moralistic ordinances made against prostitution, misrepresentation and false practices in business.

A servant of Northampton&#x27;s during his mayoralty was Thomas Usk who, after being arrested in 1384 by Northampton&#x27;s rival Nicholas Brembre, gained release by informing on his former master through a legal appeal.

==Arrest, imprisonment, pardon==
At the election in 1383 Northampton was ousted by Brembre, who packed the Guildhall with armed support and got himself elected. Brembre had Northampton arrested on charges of sedition on 7 February 1384, and provoking an &#x27;insurrection&#x27; in the city on the 11th, involving shop closures by supporters. His kinsman, John Constantine, was executed for his part in leading this. Northampton and two associates, John More and Richard Norbury, were sentenced to death in trial before the King at Reading, Berkshire but this was commuted to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment, each man to be held in a separate prison at least 100 leagues outside London. Northampton, possibly through the influence of Cornish judge Sir Robert Tresilian, was confined at Tintagel.

In 1386 the King pardoned Northampton but he remained banished from the city. Following the Merciless Parliament, as a result of which Brembre and Usk were executed in 1388, his situation improved with a full pardon granted in December 1390 and a full restoration of his citizenship in 1395.

==Last years==
Northampton died in 1398 and was buried in the church of the Hospital of St Mary de Elsyngspital, Cripplegate. He had prospered to the extent of leaving property valued about £5,000, enabling him to be a benefactor to the Charterhouse monastery, to whose monks he made gifts of dates, figs and raisins during Lent.

<text>Wa&#x27;el Hamza Julaidan (, kunya: &quot;Abu al-Hasan&quot;; born 22 February 1958 in Medina, Saudi Arabia) is one of the original founders of al-Qaeda in August 1988.

He had previously (1984) established &quot;the Service Office&quot; or &quot;Maktab al-Khidamat &quot; in Afghanistan, along with bin Laden and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam. Many of the supporters of al-Qaeda were trained in the Afghan military camps this trio set up in support of the mujahideen resistance movement against the Soviet occupation.

He was the president of the Tucson Islamic Center from 1984 to 1985. In 1986 he left Tucson to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1987, he traveled to Hijaz, and was expected to return to Karachi.

For his suspected role in al-Qaeda, Julaidan was placed under worldwide embargo by the United Nations, in 2002.
His UN embargo was lifted in 2014.

Dawkins was born and raised in Washington, D.C. He played basketball at Mackin Catholic High School in Washington, D.C. before enrolling at Duke University. At Duke, he became the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 2,556 points, which stood until 2006 when JJ Redick surpassed it. In Dawkins&#x27; senior year at Duke, the 1985–86 season, the Duke Blue Devils attained a win–loss record of 37–3, which was an NCAA record for both games played and games won in a single season. They reached the 1986 NCAA championship game, where they lost to Louisville, 72–69. In his senior season, Dawkins averaged 20.2 points per game and won the Naismith College Player of the Year Award, presented to the nation&#x27;s top Collegiate Basketball Player. He also served as alternate on the 1984 United States Olympic basketball team. He graduated with a degree in political science.

His jersey number 24 was later retired. Dawkins has received a number of honors, including selection to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in Atlantic Coast Conference history and being named the 78th greatest player in college basketball history by &quot;The Sporting News&#x27;&quot; book, &quot;Legends of College Basketball&quot;, in 2002.

===NBA===
In the 1986 NBA draft, Dawkins was selected by the San Antonio Spurs as the 10th pick overall. He appeared in the 1987 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where he finished sixth out of eight. He ended up playing in the NBA for nine seasons, also appearing for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Detroit Pistons. In his NBA career, he averaged 11.1 points, 5.5 assists and 2.5 rebounds.

==Coaching career==
Following his NBA career, Dawkins went back to Duke University in 1996, where he worked as an administrative intern in the athletic department and was on the air as an analyst for Duke&#x27;s home basketball games. He joined the Duke coaching staff in 1998, working alongside head coach Mike Krzyzewski. He was promoted to associate head coach in charge of player development in 1999.

In April 2008, he was named head coach at Stanford University, succeeding Trent Johnson. During his time with the Cardinal, he became known as &quot;the king of the NIT&quot; (with crowns in 2012 and 2015). But Dawkins could not get over the hump in the NCAA tournament, with only one appearance (2014) in 8 seasons.

On March 14, 2016, at the conclusion of his eighth season, and after a disappointing one NCAA Tournament appearance in eight seasons as head coach, Dawkins was fired.

On March 23, 2016, Dawkins was hired as head coach by the University of Central Florida. Shortly thereafter, his son, Aubrey Dawkins, transferred from Michigan to play for his father.

On March 2, 2019, UCF defeated (#8 AP Poll/#6 Coaches Poll) Houston at Fertitta Center, stopping the nation&#x27;s longest home winning streak at 33. With the win UCF entered the AP Poll for the first time since the 2010–11 Knights spent four weeks in the poll, peaking at 19.

<text>Click! Network is an open access broadband cable system owned by Tacoma Power, a part of Tacoma Public Utilities in Tacoma, Washington. It provides cable television and Internet connectivity for residents and businesses in Tacoma, University Place, Fircrest, Lakewood and Fife.

== History ==
Back in the late 1990s there was talk of deregulation of the power industry, much like the banking and airlines industries flourished shortly after their deregulations. Utility companies are traditionally a very conservative business with relatively little change or innovation since the beginning of the century. Tacoma Power&#x27;s management team had the foresight to look into the future and predict some of the results that would come from deregulation of power companies. Deregulation would mean that power companies would no longer have their protected monopolies and they would be forced into more of a delivery business since they would still own the wires. To strengthen Tacoma Power&#x27;s position in this type of a business environment Steven Klein, then Superintendent, suggested that they invest in an innovation in their power delivery system, i.e. the &quot;SmartMeter&quot;.

When Tacoma Power started drawing up plans to develop a 100 million dollar fiber-optic network to link its power substations, and saw potential value for its customers at little additional cost to the utility to expanding the network to offer cable television, high-speed Internet and high-speed data services to the community. After originally approaching TCI Cable to be the cable television service provider and being turned down, Tacoma Power decided to create their own cable company. These services compete with the existing Comcast service providers in the area. Commercial high-speed data services began in 1997, cable TV in 1998, and high-speed Internet services over cable modem in 1999. Click! is one of the largest municipal telecommunications systems in the United States.

In 2000, the State of Washington passed RCW 54.16.330, effectively preventing further research and development of Click! Network until its repeal in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of over 20 years.

In 2020, Click! Network was sold by the Tacoma Public Utilities to Rainier Connect. The utilities would continue to own the lines, but Rainier Connect would run all operations and provide maintenance. The contract was for 20 years with two extensions. The transfer of day to day operations was highly controversial amongst the Tacoma population, but was ultimately supported due to the restrictions imposed by the State of Washington nearly 20 years prior. Controversies arose again after the state level restrictions were repealed in 2021.

After six months, Rainier Connect started migrating legacy set top box TV customers to an IPTV system. This move was also controversial among the Tacoma population, much of whom had limited technical skills and would have significant trouble adapting to an IPTV system.

Click! Network remains a highly political topic within local politics in the City of Tacoma because of its implications for the city, region, state of Washington, and implementation specifics of the federal Build Back Better Plan.

<text>Southdale is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created in the provincial redistribution 1999, mostly out of Niakwa and part of St. Vital. The riding is located in the southeastern section of the City of Winnipeg.

Southdale is bordered on the east by the rural ridings of La Verendrye and Springfield, to the south by Seine River, to the north by Radisson and St. Boniface, and to the west by Riel and St. Vital.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,029. Its character is mostly middle class. In 1999, the average family income was $68,944, and the unemployment rate was 5.00%. Twelve per cent of Southdale&#x27;s residents are francophone. Health and social service work accounts for 14% of Southdale&#x27;s industry.

From 2003 to 2007, Southdale was the only riding in southeastern Winnipeg to be represented by a Progressive Conservative, following historical breakthroughs by the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) in surrounding ridings in the 2003 provincial election. The NDP proceeded to oust incumbent MLA Jack Reimer in the 2007 provincial election, completing their sweep of Southeast Winnipeg. The seat remained NDP from 2007 until 2016 when it returned to the PCs.

<doc id="1279932" wikidata="Q7589682" url="?curid=1279932" title="St. Louis Regional Airport">
<text>St. Louis Regional Airport is a public airport four miles (6 km) east of Alton, in Madison County, Illinois, United States. It is in the village of Bethalto but its mailing address is East Alton.

Its operations are paid for by an airport taxation district created in 1946, which collects taxes from property owners in the Madison County townships of Alton, Wood River, Foster and Fort Russell.

== History ==
Civic Memorial Airport opened in 1946 and received its current name in 1984. The property was purchased by Colonel Milton Waltson after his discharge from the Army Air Corps after WWII. Walston also purchased some surplus Quonset huts and airplanes from the military. The name Walston Aviation is visible on one of the still remaining original buildings at the airport.

== Facilities==
The airfield sits at 544 ft (166 m) MSL. It has an 8,099 by 150 ft (2,469 by 46 m) runway that runs roughly east–west (11/29) and a 6,500 by 100 ft (1,981 by 30 m) crosswind runway that runs north–south (17/35). With an ILS approach and tower controlled class D airspace, the facility can accommodate a Boeing 747.

For the 12-month period ending April 30, 2017, the airport had 39,828 aircraft operations, an average of 109 per day: 85% general aviation, 13% air taxi, 2% military and less than 1% commercial service. In March 2018, there were 79 aircraft based at this airport: 73 single-engine, 4 multi-engine and 2 jet.

West Star Aviation is the largest fixed-base operations (FBO) company at the airport. In 2008, Premiere Air changed its name to West Star aviation, and the company has remained since that time. The company provides a wide range of services from engine repair, interior and exterior paint services, avionics installation and repair, refurbishing, aircraft part sales, and airframe inspections.

The airport is popular with blimp crews, being a frequent stop for blimps on transcontinental flights across the United States.

==Ground transportation==
Public transit service to the airport is provided by Madison County Transit.

<text>Atlas Arteria (), formerly known as Macquarie Atlas Roads, is one of the world&#x27;s largest developers and operators of private toll roads.

==Intoll demerger== 
Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG) had a portfolio of 11 toll roads across seven countries including Australia. MIG had previously in June 2006 spun off Sydney Roads Group which included its stake in three Sydney toll roads, namely M4 Western Motorway (50.61%), M5 South-West Motorway (50%) and Eastern Distributor (71.35%). Sydney Roads Group was sold to Transurban in April 2007.

In February 2010 MIG underwent a restructure into two separately listed companies; Intoll and Macquarie Atlas. Whilst Macquarie Atlas continues to be managed by Macquarie, Intoll is internally managed. Murray Bleach is the chief executive officer of Intoll. At the time, Intoll () owned and managed a 25% interest in the Westlink M7 in western Sydney, Australia and a 30% interest in the 108 km-long 407 Express Toll Route in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada. Intoll was acquired in full by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) on 14 December 2010.

In 2018, Macquarie Atlas Roads changed its name to Atlas Arteria after an agreement with the Macquarie Group to bring management in-house.

in 2022, Atlas Arteria bought a $ 2bn stake in Chicago Skyway.

<text>Garrison Creek was a short stream about long that flowed southeast into the west side of Toronto Harbour in Ontario, Canada.
It has been largely covered over and filled in, but geographical traces of the creek can still be found, including the natural amphitheatre known as Christie Pits and the off-leash dog &quot;bowl&quot; of Trinity Bellwoods Park. The name &quot;Garrison Creek&quot; was used because Fort York was built near the creek mouth. Volunteers lead popular tours of the course of the old watershed.

==History==
Garrison Creek was one of a number of small natural watercourses on the site of the current city of Toronto.
Starting in the 1870s, the stream was diverted into underground sewers under city streets and the original course was filled in with soil. By 1920, the stream was entirely diverted into the sewer system. There are many artifacts of the Creek&#x27;s existence, including buried bridges along Harbord Street and Crawford Street south of Dundas Street. The unusual courses of Niagara Street (north of Fort York) and Vaughan Road (St. Clair and Bathurst area) indicate that they were once trails following the banks of the creek.
In 2013 particularly strong rainstorms caused the storm sewers that replaced Garrison Creek to flood, at Christie Pits, Trinity Bellwoods Park, and a railway underpass at King Street and Atlantic Avenue.
Both Christie Pits and Trinity Bellwoods Park are over the original Garrison Creek Ravine, while the King and Atlantic intersection is over the course of Asylum Stream, a tributary that ran from just northwest of Fort York to Lisgar Street and Queen Street West near the former Provincial Asylum.

==Course==
The stream had two sources, one north of St. Clair Avenue, near Humewood Public School, and the other northwest of the present-day Dufferin Street and St. Clair Avenue intersection.
The main course travels due south to south of King Street, where it turned to the southeast and emptied into Toronto Bay at the present-day intersection of Bathurst Street and Lake Shore Boulevard.

Tributaries along the creek included:

* Springmount Stream
* London Stream
* Dewson Stream
* Asylum Stream
* Stafford Stream
* Denison Creek (which had its own tributaries):
** Brock Stream
** Havelock Stream
** Moutray Stream

<doc id="1279941" wikidata="Q2254440" url="?curid=1279941" title="Chełmno Voivodeship">
<text>The Chełmno Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland since 1454/1466 until the Partitions of Poland in 1772/1793. Its capital was at Chełmno.

Together with the Pomeranian and Malbork Voivodeships and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia it formed the province of Royal Prussia, and with several other voivodeships it formed the Greater Poland Province.

==History==

The Chełmno Land (later known in German as &quot;Kulmerland&quot;) had been part of the Polish Duchy of Masovia since 1138. It was occupied by pagan Old Prussian tribes in 1216, who struggled against their Christianization instigated by Bishop Christian of Oliva. After several unsuccessful attempts to reconquer Chełmno, Duke Konrad I of Masovia in 1226 called for support by the Teutonic Knights, who indeed approached and started a Prussian campaign, after the duke promised to grant the Chełmno Land as a fief to the Teutonic Order.

In the course of the Order&#x27;s decline after the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, the citizens of Chełmno, Toruń (&quot;Thorn&quot;), Lubawa (&quot;Löbau&quot;), Brodnica, Grudziądz, Nowe Miasto and Radzyń co-formed the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. In 1454, the organisation led an uprising against the rule of the Teutonic Knights, and asked King Casimir IV of Poland to reincorporate the region to the Kingdom of Poland, to which the King agreed and signed the act of reincorporation, which sparked the Thirteen Years&#x27; War between the Knights and the Kingdom of Poland. The towns and nobles of the region then took an oath of allegiance to Poland in Toruń in May 1454. The Chełmno Voivodeship was established the same year. After the Order&#x27;s defeat, the reintegration of Chełmno Land with Poland was confirmed in the Second Peace of Thorn and together with the adjacent Lubawa Land in the east it formed the Chełmno Voivodeship of the Polish Crown, since the 1569 Union of Lublin part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The voivodeship was annexed by Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, except for the city of Toruń, which was not incorporated into the province of West Prussia until the 1793 Second Partition.

<text>&quot;An American Trilogy&quot; is a 1972 song medley arranged by country composer Mickey Newbury and popularized by Elvis Presley, who included it as a showstopper in his concert routines. The medley uses three 19th-century songs: 
*&quot;Dixie&quot; — a popular folk song about the southern United States.
*&quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; — a marching hymn of the Union Army during the American Civil War; and
*&quot;All My Trials&quot; — a Bahamian lullaby related to African American spirituals and widely used by folk music revivalists

==First performances==
Newbury first recorded &quot;An American Trilogy&quot; for his 1971 album &quot;Frisco Mabel Joy&quot;, and the medley featured prominently on his first concert album, &quot;Live at Montezuma Hall&quot;, released in 1973. The studio recording reached No. 26 on the charts in 1972, and No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Easy Listening chart. Newbury&#x27;s version was used for nightly TV sign offs for KTBS, KLFY &amp; WRBT in the mid to late 1970s.

Presley began singing &quot;An American Trilogy&quot; in concert in January 1972; a live recording made the following month was released as a single by RCA Records. Presley modifies Newbury&#x27;s sequence by reprising after &quot;All My Trials&quot; both &quot;Dixie&quot; (in the solo flute) and with a bigger ending on &quot;Battle Hymn&quot;. He performs the medley in the 1972 concert film &quot;Elvis on Tour&quot;. Presley&#x27;s version didn&#x27;t equal the US chart success of Newbury&#x27;s single, reaching No. 66 late in 1972 and peaking at No. 31 on the Easy Listening chart. However, it was included in both versions of the widely-seen 1973 satellite telecast &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot;. Presley&#x27;s recording was more successful in the UK, where it reached No. 8.

==Other versions==

In 2002 the medley was covered by heavy metal band Manowar, appearing as the sixth track on the album &quot;Warriors of the World&quot;. It was also featured on country singer Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock&#x27;s live album &quot;Live -N- Kickin&#x27;&quot; in 2009. Alwyn Humphreys&#x27; arrangement for male choir is popular and features on albums by the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir and Morriston Orpheus Choir. &quot;An American Trilogy&quot; is referenced and partially sung in the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; &quot;Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier&quot; on the &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; album. Presley&#x27;s&#x27; version from &quot;Aloha From Hawaii&quot; was also arranged for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra for the 2015 compilation album &quot;If I Can Dream&quot;. In all, over 465 versions have been recorded by various artists.

<doc id="1279947" wikidata="Q3298567" url="?curid=1279947" title="Habitants">
<text>Habitants () were French settlers and inhabitants of French origin who farmed the land along both shores of the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in what is now Quebec, Canada. The term was used by the inhabitants themselves and the other classes of French Canadian society from the 17th century to the early 20th century, when the word declined in usage in favour of the more modern &quot;agriculteur&quot; (farmer) or &quot;producteur agricole&quot; (agricultural producer).

Habitants in New France were largely defined by the condition on the land that it could be forfeited unless it was cleared within a certain period of time. That condition kept the land from being sold by the seigneur and led instead to its being subgranted to peasant farmers, also called habitants. When habitants were granted the title deed to a lot, they had to agree to accept a variety of annual charges and restrictions. Rent was the most important of them and could be in money, produce, or labour. Once the rent was set, it could not be altered for inflation or time. Habitants essentially were free to develop their land as they wished, with only a few obligations to the seigneur.

Likewise, a seigneur did not have many responsibilities towards his habitants. The seigneur was obligated to build a gristmill for his tenants, who in turn were required to grind their grain there and to provide him with one sack of flour out of every 14. The seigneur was also allowed to a specific number of days of labour by habitants and to claim rights over fishing, timberm, and common pastures.

Though the seigneurs&#x27; demands became more significant at the end of French rule, they could neither obtain enough resources from the rents and fees imposed on the habitants alone to become truly wealthy or to leave their tenants in poverty. Habitants were free individuals; seigneurs simply owned a &quot;bundle of specific and limited rights over productive activity within that territory&quot;. The seigneur–habitant relationship was one in which both parties were owners of the land and divided the attributes of ownership between them.

==Economy and taxes==
Most habitants grew crops that satisfied their own household needs for food and clothing and did not grow crops to sell on the market. Seigneurial farmers took the subsistence approach because of the smaller market that existed in Quebec. There had always been an exceedingly high number of farmers in New France and even in the early history of Quebec. It is estimated that in 1851, about 70% of Quebec&#x27;s residents were farmers. In the Eastern United States, those numbers were drastically different. The earliest census data on the topic show that in 1870, only 13% of residents in Massachusetts and 25% of in New York State were farmers. At the time, the agricultural sector still accounted for over half of Quebec&#x27;s working population. Those contrasting numbers show that the Quebec farmer served an internal market that was a third the size of the market available to the average New York State farmer. The smaller market in New France meant that habitants had little surplus wealth. Despite the lack of surplus income, habitants still had to pay a variety of annual dues for the land received from a seigneur.

There were certain responsibilities, or &quot;duties&quot;, that came with receiving a free plot of land from the seigneur. Firstly, habitants were expected to cultivate and live on the land. If a piece of land was not cultivated within a year, the seigneur had the &quot;droit de réunion&quot;, or the right of repossession. Secondly, there were several dues that habitants had to pay to the seigneur. One due was the &quot;cens&quot;, which ranged between 2 and 6 sols. The charge was mostly symbolic since it was a fairly paltry sum. Rent was typically set at an annual rate of 20 sols for every &quot;arpent&quot; of land, and significant expenses would typically be paid each year by habitants to the seigneur towards fees for livestock grazing on the villages&#x27; common fields, wood harvesting, etc. Seigneurs also received &quot;lods et ventes&quot; if habitants sold their land that was equivalent to one twelfth of the sale price. Habitants also had the duty to grind wheat at the seigneurial mill and pay a fee of one fourteenth of the wheat that was ground. Some habitants also owed the seigneur one thirteenth of the total amount of fish that they caught. In addition, some habitants were responsible for completing one to four days of mandatory work during the sowing, harvesting, or haying seasons, which were called &quot;corvées&quot;. Habitants were expected to fulfill all of those obligations to repay the seigneur for granting them the land in the first place.

==Family life==
Habitants went to New France to find a better life and so that they would have better farming opportunities. They moved to New France also so that they could have larger land holdings, which they eventually would pass on to their children.

For women, most of the adulthood was spent being a wife and raising children. Marriage was essential for women in New France, and widowers often remarried. The significantly greater male population often allowed women their choice of partner, and arranged marriages were infrequent. Some women were paid by the King of France to boost the population and were called the &quot;filles du roi&quot;.

The Catholic Church played an important role in the habitants&#x27; lives; it was the parish that recorded all the births, marriages, and deaths in the colony. Those important events were considered religious traditions and were marked by rituals. Nevertheless, parishes developed only in areas with a significant population. Habitants provided the local church and rectory, which were commonly used as meeting places and as community halls, and emergency food stores were often kept in the church&#x27;s attic. Habitants also viewed Sunday Mass as not only a time for worship but also a time for communal gathering and socializing.

<doc id="1279951" wikidata="Q82114" url="?curid=1279951" title="Malbork Voivodeship">
<text>The Malbork Voivodeship (), after Partitions of Poland also referred to as the Malbork Land (Polish: &quot;Ziemia malborska&quot;), was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland from 1454/1466 until the Partitions of Poland in 1772–1795. Its capital was at Malbork.

Together with the Pomeranian and Chełmno Voivodeships and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia it formed the historical province of Royal Prussia, and with several more voivodeships it formed part of the Greater Poland Province.

==History==


After the Teutonic Knights during the 13th century had conquered the Prussian territories and incorporated them into the Order&#x27;s State, the castle of Marienburg served as the seat of the Grand Masters. Following the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, the Knights once again could withstand the Polish Siege of Marienburg. In 1440, various cities, towns and nobles from the area co-formed the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. In 1454, the organisation led an uprising against the rule of the Teutonic Knights, and asked King Casimir IV of Poland to include the region within the Kingdom of Poland, to which the King agreed and signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland in March 1454 in Kraków, which sparked the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. The cities of Elbląg, Malbork, Sztum and Tolkmicko were members of the Confederation, whereas Dzierzgoń also sided with Poland in the war. The Teutonic Knights had to withdraw from Malbork to Königsberg and after their final defeat lost the castle and the surrounding territory in the 1466 Second Peace of Thorn.

King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland established the Malbork Voivodeship, including the towns of Elbing (Elbląg), Stuhm (Sztum) and Christburg (Kiszpork/Dzierzgoń). Since the 1569 Union of Lublin the Lands of the Polish Crown were part of the larger Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Malbork Castle was occupied twice by troops of the Swedish Empire: during the Thirty Years&#x27; War 1626–1629 and again from 1656 to 1660 during the Deluge. Truces between Poland and Sweden were signed in the Malbork Voivodeship in 1629 and 1635.

In 1772, the voivodeship was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland and became part of the newly established Province of West Prussia the next year.

Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Malbork Voivodeship:

&quot;The smallest of three voivodeships of Polish Prussia, it was divided into four counties: Sztum, Kiszpork, Elbląg and Malbork. Local starostas resided at Kiszpork, Sztum, Tolkmicko, and other locations. Sejmiks and courts were not located at Malbork, but at Sztum, which itself was governed by the starosta of Kiszpork. At sejmiks, local nobility elected eight deputies to the Prussian Sejm, e.g. two from each county (...) Malbork Voivodeship’s coat of arms was almost identical as Chełmno Voivodeship&#x27;s, with differences in color of the eagle. The Prussian Sejm took place alternatively at Malbork and Grudziądz&quot;.

==Cities==
The largest city of the voivodeship was Elbląg, which as one of the largest and most influential cities of entire Poland enjoyed voting rights during the Royal free elections. Other cities were Malbork, Sztum, Kiszpork, and Tolkmicko, and all cities in the voivodeship were royal cities of Poland.

<text>The Australian Music Examinations Board (AMEB) is a federated, privately funded corporation which provides a program of examinations for music, speech and drama in Australia.

The organisation had its beginnings at the Universities of Melbourne and Adelaide in 1887 and later became a national body in 1918. It now has six state offices as well as a Federal Office in Melbourne. The Federal Board consists of representatives of educational institutions that are signatories to the AMEB constitution. These are the Universities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia, the Minister for Education and Training, New South Wales, the Minister for Education, Training and Employment, Queensland and the Minister for Education and Skills, Tasmania through the University of Tasmania. The AMEB is used to determine admission into the Defence Force School of Music in Victoria.

The AMEB consists of a federation of branches in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory and Tasmania. In addition, there is a National office whose board consists of a representative from each state board.

AMEB examinations are based on syllabuses set by the Federal Board in conjunction with the music and speech and drama community. AMEB produces a range of publications which support students and teachers preparing for exams.

AMEB offers syllabuses and examinations in a broad range of subjects including:

* Music Teaching
* Music Theory (Theory of Music, Musicianship, Music Craft)
* Keyboard (Piano, Piano for Leisure, P Plate Piano, Organ, Electronic Organ)
* Strings (Violin, Viola, Cello, Double Bass, Classical Guitar, Harp)
* Woodwind (Recorder, Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon, Saxophone, Saxophone for Leisure)
* Brass (Horn, Trumpet, Trombone, Bass Trombone, Tuba, Euphonium)
* Brass Band Instruments (Instruments in B flat, E flat and C)
* Percussion
* Voice (Singing, Singing for Leisure)
* Contemporary Popular Music (Keyboard, Vocal, Drum Kit, Guitar, Bass)
* Musical Ensembles (Brass, Mixed, Percussion, Strings, Woodwind)
* Speech and Drama

AMEB examinations cover a large range of skill levels; from a &quot;Preliminary&quot; grade suitable for very young children through to academic degree-level diplomas, including the &quot;Associate in Music&quot; (AMusA), the &quot;Licentiate in Music&quot; (LMusA), and ultimately the &quot;Fellowship in Music&quot; (FMusA), a diploma that is often conferred on an honorary basis to musical luminaries.

AMEB has recently introduced online examinations for music theory and online courses for Theory of Music.

In addition to the standard syllabuses, AMEB has a series of &quot;for leisure&quot; syllabuses for the piano, saxophone and voice which contain a repertoire of modern music. AMEB also has a Contemporary Popular Music (CPM) offering for Keyboard, Drum Kit, Guitar, Bass and Voice.

<doc id="1279960" wikidata="Q2386985" url="?curid=1279960" title="Tacoma Rail">
<text>Tacoma Rail is a publicly owned Class III shortline railroad. It is owned by the city of Tacoma, Washington and operated as a public utility. It is one of three operating divisions of the municipally-owned Tacoma Public Utilities service, but unlike other city services, the railroad is self-supported and generates revenue for the City of Tacoma and Washington State. Tacoma Rail provides freight switching services, serving the Port of Tacoma and customers in Tacoma, south Pierce County and formerly parts of Thurston County. It operates 16 diesel locomotives, more than 100 employees, and about of track, many of which are former Milwaukee Road and BNSF Railway lines around Western Washington.

== Operating divisions ==
Tacoma Rail operates two distinct divisions:

=== Tidelands division ===
The Tidelands division serves the area around the Port of Tacoma, including all four intermodal terminals and interchanging with both the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad. The division serves 40 customers, and handles the majority of Tacoma Rail’s traffic.

The division was established in 1914 as a streetcar line to move port workers but has been freight-only since 1937. In the past, the division was called the Tacoma Municipal Belt Line.

=== Lakewood division ===
The Lakewood division runs between Tacoma and DuPont. The operation of the division was acquired from BNSF Railway in November 2004.

The division serves 11 customers, mostly in the Lakewood area. Sound Transit also owns tracks and has trackage rights between Tacoma and Lakewood to operate its Sounder commuter rail. WSDOT has paid to improve the line in recent years with plans to reroute the Amtrak Cascades and Coast Starlight to the tracks planned for 2019.

==Former divisions==

=== Mountain division ===
The Mountain division ran between Tacoma and Frederickson, where it splits into two branches, one serving McKenna, the other serving Eatonville and Morton.

The 97 miles of track were owned directly by the City of Tacoma and are operated by Tacoma Rail under contract. It was considered a separate railroad and was operated using its own TRMW reporting mark. This segment of track was originally built by the Milwaukee Road and later used by the 2nd Chehalis Western Railroad and was purchased by the city on August 12, 1994.

The division served as many as 14 customers at one time, mostly in the Frederickson area. The Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad leased the portion of track from Eatonville to Morton for passenger excursion service. MRSR ceased operating, but is soft reopening in late 2023 or early 2024. 

Due to dwindling customer base (one as of 2023), Tacoma Rail sold the Mountain Division to WRL, which is now Rainier Rail, with RNIR reporting marks. However, the City will retain ownership of the portion of the Tacoma to Fredrickson line within the city limits, about six miles of track and structure, minus a one-mile stretch sold to Sound Transit for use by passenger and commuter trains as part of Sound Transit’s Lakewood Subdivision. This leaves just under five miles of track, for which Tacoma Rail will file for abandonment. This section is the costliest to maintain and includes the steepest part of the line, a 3.75% grade, a bridge over the BNSF/UP lines and a bridge and trestle over the Puyallup River, both of which are former Milwaukee Road structures built in 1917. 

WRL/Rainier Rail plans to use its portion of the north end of the Mountain Division (north of Frederickson) for car storage. There are four sidings, but two of them will require some significant work to be put back in service.

The line is severed by derailers at 72nd and McKinley, which is effectively the city limits. Most crossing markers south of this location have had electrical equipment removed and is completely idle as of November 2023.

<text>Jock Carroll (March 5, 1919 – August 4, 1995) was a Canadian writer, journalist and photographer who worked for the Canadian media, including the Toronto Telegram.

==History== 
Born in Toronto, Jock Carroll developed a 40-year career as a photojournalist, commencing in the late 1940s. He both took and developed his own photographs from a self-made darkroom and quickly became popular for being able to produce news reports with accompanying photographs. His first published works appeared in such magazines as &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot;. In 1950, Carroll joined &quot;Weekend&quot; magazine as a staff writer. He ultimately became the associate editor of the magazine, during the course of his twenty-year association with it.

During the Korean War, Carroll was a war correspondent. This experience resulted in the 1955 publication of his first book, &quot;Korean Boy&quot;, which was the true story of Pak Jong Yong, a boy who fled with his family from North Korea to Pusan, in South Korea. Carroll was able to persuade management at &quot;Weekend Magazine&quot; to sponsor Pak Jong Yong&#x27;s university education in Canada. Carroll later became the president of the Canadian War Correspondents Association.

In addition to his presidency of the Canadian War Correspondents Association, Carroll was a member of a number of journalist organizations, including the Toronto Men&#x27;s Press Club, the Authors League of America, the Professional Photographers Association of Canada and the Ontario Sports Writers Association.

In 1961, &quot;Bottoms Up&quot;, Carroll&#x27;s only novel, was published by Olympia Press. It was reissued by Collectors Publications in 1967. Collectors Publications, similar to Olympia Press, was known for publishing risqué novels. The novel is a satire about the magazine industry, with the heroine based on Marilyn Monroe, whom Carroll had interviewed and photographed in 1952. The book was not accepted for publication in Canada, due to its sexual content. Carroll then approached Maurice Girodias, the owner of Paris-based Olympia Press, who agreed to publish it. When republished in 1964 by Stein and Day as &quot;The Shy Photographer&quot;, the book was translated into multiple languages and sold half a million copies.

Carroll&#x27;s book, &quot;The Death of the Toronto Telegram and Other Newspaper Stories&quot; was published in 1971 by Pocket Books Canada, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster. The book includes many anecdotes about the Canadian newspaper business from the 1940s to 1970. Included are interviews with Marilyn Monroe in 1952, writer Arthur Hailey (1966), Elvis Presley (1956), and Toronto millionaire businessman &quot;Honest&quot; Ed Mirvish (1970).

In 1972, Simon &amp; Schuster published Carroll&#x27;s book on the 1972 Summer Olympic Games.

Carroll then became associated with Pocket Books Canada as the editor of a series of mass-market paperbacks by Canadian authors, known as &quot;Carroll&#x27;s Canadian Originals&quot;. Included in the series was Carroll&#x27;s own book, &quot;Down The Road&quot;, published in 1974. The book was promoted as &quot;Uninhibited talks with Marilyn Monroe and other famous sex symbols. Photos.&quot; and included a cover photo of a Marilyn Monroe lookalike.

Carroll&#x27;s next book was &quot;The Life and Times of Gregory Clark, Canada&#x27;s Favorite Storyteller&quot;, published by Doubleday in 1981. Clark was a well-known Canadian journalist who had died in 1977. Clark was also Caroll&#x27;s colleague at &quot;Weekend Magazine&quot;, where Clark was the back-page columnist.

In 1984, Carroll contributed the text to &quot;The Farm&quot;, which featured photographs by Reuben R. Sallows and John de Visser. Reuben Sallows (1855–1937) had gained fame as one of Canada&#x27;s early professional photographers, while John de Visser had been a professional photographer in Canada since the early 1960s. The book, published by Methuen to commemorate the sesquicentennial of Ontario, was a history of Ontario farming in the early 20th century. Black and white photos by Sallows were complemented by contemporary colour photos by de Visser, plus text from Carroll.

In 1995, Carroll was subject to a claim in relation to copyright and ownership issues, regarding his book of photographs of Glenn Gould, (&quot;Glenn Gould: Some Portraits of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, (Stoddart 1995). Carroll had taken the photographs in 1956, during the course of also interviewing Gould for a magazine article. The Court of Appeal for Ontario found in Carroll&#x27;s favour in the decision of &quot;Gould Estate v. Stoddart Publishing Co. Ltd.&quot;, though the decision was rendered subsequent to Carroll&#x27;s death.

In 1996, Carroll&#x27;s book, &quot;Falling For Marilyn: The Lost Niagara Collection&quot;, was published posthumously by Stoddart Publishing. It contains photographs of Marilyn Monroe taken by Carroll in 1952, on the set of the film &quot;Niagara&quot;, which had originally accompanied a 1952 article by Carroll in &quot;Weekend&quot; magazine.

<text>Riel is a provincial electoral division or riding in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1968, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1969. The riding is in the south-central region of Winnipeg, Manitoba&#x27;s capital and largest city, and is named after Louis Riel, the leader of the 1870 Red River Rebellion.

Riel is bordered to the south by Seine River, to the east across the Seine River by Lagimodière, to the north by St. Vital, to the northwest by Fort Garry, and to the southwest by Fort Richmond, the latter two across the Red River of the North.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,228. The riding&#x27;s character is mostly middle- and upper middle-class. In 1999, the average family income was $63,126, and the unemployment rate was 5.50%. Nine percent of the riding&#x27;s residents are francophone.

The service industry accounts for 15% of Riel&#x27;s economy, followed by health and social services at 12.5%.

A Progressive Conservative–New Democrat swing seat, Riel is often considered one of the bellwether constituencies in Manitoba. It has elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly from the party that has won every general election since 1988; the NDP and PCs have supplied all its MLAs since it was established while the Liberals last came second here in 1995. The current MLA is Mike Moyes of the NDP. The previous MLA was Rochelle Squires of the PCs.

<doc id="1279966" wikidata="Q1754596" url="?curid=1279966" title="Moody Blue">
<text>Moody Blue is the twenty-fourth and final studio album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released on July 19, 1977, by RCA Records, about four weeks before his death. The album was a mixture of live and studio work and included the four tracks from Presley&#x27;s final studio recording sessions in October 1976 and two tracks left over from the previous Graceland session in February 1976. &quot;Moody Blue&quot; was a previously published hit song recorded at the earlier Graceland session and held over for this album. Also recorded at the February session was &quot;She Thinks I Still Care&quot;. &quot;Way Down&quot; became a hit after Presley&#x27;s death less than one month after this album&#x27;s release. The album was certified Gold and Platinum on September 12, 1977, and 2× Platinum on March 27, 1992, by the RIAA.

The first American copies of &quot;Moody Blue&quot; were pressed on limited edition translucent blue vinyl, the first time a Presley album had been issued on colored vinyl. The album soon reverted to black vinyl; after Presley&#x27;s death, the album was heavily in demand and repressed in blue vinyl, making the original US black vinyl issue the scarcer of the two. In the US, the album was also released in white and yellow vinyls. All overseas pressings were on black vinyl, except for the first Argentinian and Canadian pressings that were pressed in blue translucent vinyl.

==Contents==
As described in &quot;Elvis: The Illustrated Record&quot;, RCA was not able to obtain sufficient new studio material for a complete album, with all but two songs of Presley&#x27;s studio recordings of 1976 having already been used in the previous album, &quot;From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee&quot; or released as singles. The company chose to use the contents of two singles that had not yet been included on an album, along with the two last remaining unreleased tracks from the Graceland sessions; the track list was then augmented with three live songs recorded in multi-track 
in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on April 24 and 26, 1977, which were heavily overdubbed for the album. One of these was his version of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, on which he accompanied himself on the piano. 

RCA producer Felton Jarvis had booked a recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee, for January 1977, to record some new tracks for this album. Presley had chosen a few songs to record with the help of Jarvis, most of them country and uptempo. Unfortunately, Presley never appeared for that session, claiming that he was ill and thus staying at home (an excuse that Presley used rather frequently during the 1960s to avoid recording poor soundtracks for his motion pictures). Additionally, Jarvis had tried to get Elvis to record the song &quot;There&#x27;s a Fire Down Below&quot; (written by Elvis’ bassist Jerry Scheff of his TCB Band) during the October 1976 sessions, but succeeded only in getting the backing instrumental track recorded and was unable to get Elvis to record a vocal. Jarvis and RCA had nothing left to do but complete the album using the live tracks mentioned above. &quot;Let Me Be There&quot; which had already been issued only three years earlier on the album &quot;Elvis: As Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis&quot; and was still available at the time of this album&#x27;s release was also included as RCA did not have any other new tracks to include besides live versions of previously released songs. They had a few new songs as live recordings but only as a poor quality soundboard recordings.

The song &quot;Moody Blue&quot; was released as a single in November 1976 and it reached number one on the Billboard Country Singles Chart and #31 on the pop chart. &quot;Way Down&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s next single during the early summer of 1977. It did not go very far up the chart initially, but it soared to #18 after Presley&#x27;s death in August (jumping to number one in the U.K.) It was a bigger hit on the country charts, and it had risen to number one in the same week of the death of Presley. This album reached number three on the Billboard album charts after his death, although it had already entered the top 40 before he died. This was the last album by Presley to reach the top 40. &quot;Moody Blue&quot; was also a number one album on the Country Albums chart. &quot;Moody Blue&quot; was issued in late June 1977, and it peaked on the album chart at #3 after Elvis&#x27; death on August 16, 1977.

RCA pressed the album on blue vinyl, to match the title track. Since colored vinyl pressings were relatively uncommon at the time, and they almost never occurred in a wide release, this has led to collectors mistakenly assuming that blue vinyl copies of &quot;Moody Blue&quot; are collectors&#x27; items, when in fact, the true collectables are pressings from immediately before Presley&#x27;s death on standard black vinyl. (Immediately following his death, the production of &quot;Moody Blue&quot; was shifted back to blue vinyl. However, in later years the album was produced again using standard black vinyl).
Following Presley&#x27;s death, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was also released as a single, and it peaked at #6 on the country music charts. This version was not the same as on the &quot;Moody Blue&quot; LP. The single version was an overdubbed version of another live version, recorded in Rapid City, June 21, 1977, during one of the two concerts that produced the album and TV special &quot;Elvis In Concert&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; concluded that &quot;the voice is still intact, but the arrangements are often off-center and the material is often uninspired.&quot;

==Reissues==
The original RCA CD issue contained the same tracks and cover art as the original vinyl LP. RCA reissued the album on CD again in 2000 with revised cover art including a different concert photo of Elvis and omitted the track &quot;Let Me Be There&quot;, due to its presence on &quot;Elvis: As Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis&quot;, and it added the complete album &quot;From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee&quot; as tracks 10–19 – in effect compiling the Graceland sessions rather than reissuing the original album. In 2013, &quot;Moody Blue&quot; was reissued on the Follow That Dream label in a special edition that contained the original album tracks along with a selection of alternate takes.

<text>The Federal Constitution of Austria () is the body of all constitutional law of the Republic of Austria on the federal level. It is split up over many different acts. Its centerpiece is the Federal Constitutional Law (&quot;Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz&quot;) (B-VG), which includes the most important federal constitutional provisions.

Apart from the B-VG, there are many other &#x27;federal constitutional laws&#x27; (&quot;Bundesverfassungsgesetze&quot;, singular &quot;Bundesverfassungsgesetz&quot;, abbrev. BVG, i.e. without the hyphen), as well as individual provisions in statutes and treaties that are designated as constitutional (&quot;Verfassungsbestimmung&quot;). For example, the B-VG does not include a bill of rights, but provisions on civil liberties are split up over various constitutional pieces of legislation.

Over time, both the B-VG and the numerous pieces of constitutional law supplementing it have undergone hundreds of minor and major amendments and revisions.

==History==
Austria has been governed by multiple constitutions, including the Pillersdorf Constitution in 1848, the &quot;irrevocable&quot; Stadion Constitution from 1848 to 1851, the October Diploma in 1860, the February Patent from 1861 until 1865.

The B-VG was based on drafts whose principal author was Hans Kelsen and was first enacted on October 1, 1920. Since political agreement over a bill of rights could not be reached, the Basic Law on the General Rights of Citizens (&quot;Staatsgrundgesetz über die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsbürger&quot;) of 1867 was left in place and designated as constitutional law.

Originally, the B-VG was very parliamentarian in character. The prerogative to enact law was to lie with a comparatively strong parliament, the Federal Assembly composed of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. The responsibility for implementing law was to reside with a cabinet headed by a chancellor, who was nominated by the National Council on a motion by its principal committee. A relatively weak president, who was elected by both houses, was to serve as head of state.

In 1929, the constitution underwent a revision significantly broadening the prerogatives of the president. In particular, the president was to be elected directly by the people rather than by the legislature. The president was also to be vested with the authority to dissolve the parliament, a power typically not held by presidents of parliamentary republics. He also had the authority to formally appoint the chancellor and the cabinet. On paper, the president was vested with powers comparable to those of the President of the United States. However, in practice his role remained mostly ceremonial and representative. For example, his right to appoint the chancellor was constrained by the National Council&#x27;s power to censure the cabinet or individual ministers, meaning the president was all but required to ensure his choice of chancellor had the confidence of the National Council. He exercised many of his other executive functions on the advice of the chancellor. This move away from a government steered predominantly by a fairly large and (by definition) fractioned deliberative body towards a system concentrating power in the hands of a single autonomous leader was made in an attempt to appease the para-fascist movements (such as the Heimwehr, or later the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen and the Social Democratic Republikanischer Schutzbund) thriving in Austria at that time.

In 1934, following years of increasingly violent political strife and gradual erosion of the rule of law, the ruling Christian Social Party, which by then had turned to full-scale Austrofascism, formally replaced the constitution by a new basic law defining Austria as an authoritarian corporate state. The Austrofascist constitution was in force until Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, ceasing to exist as a sovereign state. The Constitution of Austria was eventually reinstated on May 1, 1945, Austria having reestablished itself as an independent republic shortly before Nazi Germany&#x27;s definitive collapse. The modifications enacted in 1929 were not then rescinded, and essentially remain in effect until this day, although the constitution has been heavily modified and amended since then.

==Structure==
In area, the Republic of Austria is slightly smaller than Maine, Scotland, or Hokkaidō and home to a relatively ethnically and culturally homogeneous population of 8.8 million people. Given that more than one fifth of its inhabitants are concentrated in the city of Vienna and its suburbs, the nation is also naturally unipolar in terms of both economic and cultural activity. Austria&#x27;s constitutional framework nevertheless characterizes the republic as a federation consisting of nine autonomous federal states:

Like the federation, each of the nine states of Austria has a constitution defining it to be a republican entity governed according to the principles of representative democracy. The state constitutions congruently define the states to be unicameral parliamentary democracies; each state has a legislature elected by popular vote and a cabinet appointed by its legislature. The federal constitution defines Austria itself as a bicameral parliamentary democracy with near-complete separation of powers. Austria&#x27;s government structure is thus very similar to that of much larger federal republics such as Germany or the United States. The main practical difference between Austria on one hand and Germany or the United States on the other is that Austria&#x27;s states have comparatively little autonomy: almost all matters of practical importance, including but not limited to defense, foreign politics, criminal law, corporate law, most other aspects of economic law, education, academia, welfare, telecommunications, and the health care system, lie with the federation. The judiciary (including three supreme courts) is almost exclusively federal, with the exception of nine state administrative courts.

==Federal legislature==
Federal legislative powers are vested in a body the constitution refers to as a parliament. Ever since the somewhat paradoxical 1929 revision of the constitution, which strengthened the formal separation of powers in Austria at the instigation of sympathizers of fascism, Austria&#x27;s legislature technically bears more resemblance to a congress than to a parliament. As a practical matter, however, it continues to function as a parliament anyway. Austria&#x27;s parliament consists of two houses, the National Council and the Federal Council. The 183 members of the National Council are elected by nationwide popular vote under statutes aiming at party-list proportional representation. The currently 64 members of the Federal Council are elected by Austria&#x27;s nine state legislatures under a statute allocating seats roughly proportional to state population size (the largest Bundesland being entitled to twelve members and the others accordingly, but no state to less than three). In theory, the National Council and the Federal Council are peers. As a practical matter, the National Council is decidedly more powerful; the predominance of the National Council is such that Austrians frequently use the term &quot;parliament&quot; to refer to just the National Council instead of to the parliament as a whole.

While bicameral legislatures such as the Congress of the United States allow bills to originate in both chambers, Austrian federal legislation always originates in the National Council, never in the Federal Council. In theory, bills can be sponsored by National Council members, by the federal cabinet, by popular initiative, or through a motion supported by at least one-third of the members of the Federal Council. In practice, most bills are proposed by the cabinet and passed after merely token debate. Bills passed by the National Council are sent to the Federal Council for affirmation. If the Federal Council approves of the bill or simply does nothing for a period of eight weeks, the bill has succeeded. Bills passed by both houses (or passed by the National Council and ignored by the Federal Council) are ultimately signed into law by the federal president. The president does not have the power to veto bills; a signature is a technical formality notarizing that the bill has been introduced and resolved upon in accordance to the procedure stipulated by the constitution. Legislation may be vetoed only on the ground that its genesis, not its substance, is in violation of basic law. Adjudicating upon the constitutionality of the bill itself is the exclusive prerogative of the Constitutional Court.

Provided that the bill in question neither amends the constitution such that states&#x27; rights are curtailed nor in some other way pertains to the organization of the legislature itself, the National Council can force the bill into law even if the Federal Council rejects it; a National Council resolution overruling a Federal Council objection merely has to meet a higher quorum than a regular resolution. For this reason, the Federal Council has hardly any real power to prevent the adoption of legislation, the National Council being able to override it easily. The Federal Council is sometimes compared to the British House of Lords, another deliberative body able to stall but usually not to strike down a proposed law. While the House of Lords occasionally exercises its stalling power, however, the Federal Council hardly ever does. Since the parties controlling the National Council consistently also hold a majority in the Federal Council, the latter gives its blessing to essentially everything the former has adopted.

==Federal executive==
Federal executive authority is shared by the federal president and federal cabinet. The president is elected by popular vote for a term of six years and limited to two consecutive terms of office. The president is the head of state and appoints the cabinet, a body consisting of the federal chancellor and a number of ministers. The president also appoints the members of the Constitutional Court and numerous other public officials, represents the republic in international relations, accredits foreign ambassadors, and acts as the nominal commander in chief of Austria&#x27;s armed forces.

While Austria&#x27;s federal cabinet is technically not answerable to the legislature (except for a motion of censure), it would be almost totally paralyzed without the active support of the National Council. Since constitutional convention prevents the president from using his power to dissolve the National Council on his own authority, the president is unable to hector the legislature into doing his or her bidding, and the cabinet is for all intents and purposes subject to National Council approval. The cabinet&#x27;s composition therefore reflects National Council election results rather than presidential election outcomes.

After elections, it is customary for the president to ask the leader of the strongest party to become chancellor and form a cabinet. The list is then submitted to the president by the chancellor-to-be; the president usually adopts it without much argument, although there has been at least one case in recent history where the president did refuse to install a minister. The president retains the right to dismiss the whole cabinet at will, or certain ministers of it at the request of the chancellor. Although elected for a five-year term, the National Council can dissolve itself at any time, bringing about new elections.

The federal chancellor&#x27;s dual role as executive officeholder and heavyweight party official well connected to the legislature makes the chancellor far more powerful than the formally senior federal president. Actual executive authority thus lies with the chancellor and his or her ministers, while the federal president is a figurehead rather than an actual head of government. Austria&#x27;s presidents are largely content with their ceremonial role, striving for the role of impartial mediator and dignified elder statesman, and more or less consistently steer clear of the murky waters of hands-on politics. In recent times, however, former president Heinz Fischer was known to comment occasionally on current political issues.

==Judicial and administrative review==
Federal and state judicial authority, in particular responsibility for judicial review of administrative acts, lies with the Administrative and Constitutional Court System, a structure essentially consisting of the Constitutional Court and the Administrative Court. The Constitutional Court examines the constitutionality of laws passed by Parliament, the legality of regulations by Federal ministers and other administrative authorities and finally alleged infringements of constitutional rights of individuals through decisions of the lower administrative courts. It also tries disputes between the federation and its member states, demarcation disputes between other courts and impeachments of the federal president (serving as State Court in that matter.)

The Administrative Court tries all kinds of cases which involve &quot;ex officio&quot; decisions by public officials or bodies and which are not dealt with by the Constitutional Court. Note that only the Constitutional Court has the authority to strike down laws.

In recent years, an increasing number of tribunals of a judicial nature (article 133 point 4 B-VG) hade been introduced in a number of areas to improve the review of the conduct of administrative authorities. The most important among them were the Länder independent administrative chambers (&quot;Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate&quot; - UVS), who decided, amongst other things, on second authority in proceedings relating to administrative contraventions as well as recourses against acts of direct exercise of command and constraint power from administrative authorities. Other such chambers were competent in the area of tax law (&quot;Unabhängiger Finanzsenat&quot; - UFS), in terms of asylum (&quot;Unabhängiger Bundesasylsenat&quot; - UBAS), in relation to environmental matters (&quot;Unabhängiger Umweltsenat&quot;) or in the field of telecommunications (&quot;Unabhängiger Bundeskommunikationssenat&quot;). Although all these tribunals were formally part of the administrative organization, their members had guarantees of independence and irremovability and their powers may thus be compared to jurisdictions. Their rulings could be challenged before the Administrative or the Constitutional Court. In 2014 these administrative tribunals were abolished in favour of eleven administrative courtsone in each state (&quot;Landesverwaltungsgerichte&quot;) and two on the federal level (&quot;Bundesverwaltungsgericht&quot;, &quot;Bundesfinanzgericht&quot;).

The Austrian constitution was the second in the world (nearly contemporaneous with Czechoslovakia) to enact judicial review by a Constitutional Court. It had been established in 1919 and gained the right to revise the laws of the federal states that year. After the new constitution had been adopted in 1920, the court was also entitled to revise national laws according to the constitution. This scheme of a separate constitutional court able to review legislative acts for their constitutionality came to be known as the &quot;Austrian system&quot;. After the U.S. and the British Dominions (such as Canada and Australia), where the regular court system is in charge of judicial review, Austria was one of the earliest countries to have judicial review at all (although the Czechoslovak Constitution came into force earlier, the establishment of the Court&#x27;s new rights itself predated the Czechoslovak Court by a couple of months). Many European countries adopted the Austrian system of review after World War II.

== Judiciary ==
Judicial powers not committed to the Administrative and Constitutional Court System are vested with the Civil and Criminal Court System, a structure consisting of civil courts on the one hand and criminal courts on the other hand. Civil courts try all cases in which both the claimant and the respondent are private citizens or corporations, including but not limited to contract and torts disputes: Austria&#x27;s legal system, having evolved from that of the Roman Empire, implements civil law and therefore lacks the distinction between courts of law and courts of equity sometimes found in common law jurisdictions. Civil courts do not try suits against the federation or its states in their capacity as administrative units, but only when acting in the form of private law.

Most cases are tried before District Courts (Bezirksgerichte, abbrev.: BG, singular: Bezirksgericht), with Regional Courts (Landesgerichte, abbrev.: LG, singular: Landesgericht) serving as courts of appeal and the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof, abbrev.: OGH) serving as the court of last resort. In cases considered particularly grave or technically involved, the Regional Courts serve as courts of first instance and specialized Regional Courts of Appeal (Oberlandesgerichte, abbrev.: OLG, singular: Oberlandesgericht) serve as courts of appeal, the Supreme Court still being the court of last resort.

Unlike with court systems such as that of the United States federal judiciary, parties have a statutory right to appeal. Although access to the Supreme Court has been successively restricted to matters of some importance in recent years, higher courts can generally not simply refuse to review a decision reached by subordinate courts.

Note that the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof - OGH), the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof - VfGH) and the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof - VwGH) are three separate high courts, none being senior to the other two.

==Civil and human rights==

Most closely resembling a bill of rights in Austria is the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals of the Kingdoms and Länder represented in the Council of the Realm, a decree issued by Emperor Franz Josef on December 21, 1867 in response to pressure by liberal insurgents.

A very important part of Austria&#x27;s canon of constitutional civil liberties thus originated as an imperatorial edict predating the current Constitution of Austria by roughly fifty years, the reason being that the framers of the Constitution in 1920 could not agree on a set of civil liberties to include in the constitution proper: as a lowest common denominator, they resorted to this Basic Law of 1867. Since then, other civil liberties have been set out in other constitutional laws, and Austria is party to the European Convention of Human Rights, which, too, has been implemented as a directly applicable constitutional law in Austria.

Given the fact that the Constitutional Court has begun to interpret the B-VG&#x27;s equal treatment clause and other constitutional rights rather broadly since at least the early 1980s, civil rights are, as a general matter, relatively well protected.

==Further checks and balances==
In addition to their legislative capacity, the members of the two houses of parliament have the authority to impeach the president, who is then tried before the Constitutional Court, serving as State Court, or call for a referendum to have the federal president removed from office. Exertion of these emergency powers is a two-step process: first the National Council requests the president to be impeached or subjected to referendum, then the members of the National Council and the Federal Council convene in joint session, thus forming the National Assembly, and decide on the National Council&#x27;s motion. If a referendum is held, and the President is not removed from office by popular vote, he is automatically considered re-elected for another six-year term (although he may still not serve for more than twelve consecutive years). The National Council will then be dissolved automatically and new general elections must be held.

The president may also dissolve the National Council, but only once for the same reason during his term of office. Note that the president does not have the power to veto specific acts of legislation: no matter how vehemently he objects to some particular bill, or believes it to be unconstitutional, all he can actually do is threaten to dismiss the government or dissolve the National Council before the bill is actually passed.

None of these emergency powers have been exercised thus far.

==Criticism and reform proposals==

Perhaps the most unusual aspect of Austrian constitutional law is the relative ease with which it can be changed, combined with the fact that a constitutional amendment need not be incorporated into the main text of the B-VG, or for that matter any of the more important parts of the constitutional body, but can be enacted as a separate constitutional act, or even as a simple section within any act, simply designated as &quot;constitutional&quot; (Verfassungsbestimmung).

In reality, all that is needed is a majority of two-thirds in the National Council. Only in the case of a fundamental change (&quot;Gesamtänderung&quot;) of the constitution a confirmation by referendum is required. Austria&#x27;s accession to EU in 1995 was considered such a change.

Over the years, the Austrian legal system became littered with thousands of constitutional provisions, split up over numerous acts. The reason for this was in many cases that the legislaturein particular when the governing coalition possessed a two-thirds majority in the National Council (such as between 1945–1966, 1986–1994, 1995–1999, and 2007–2008)enacted laws that were considered &quot;constitutionally problematic&quot; as constitutional laws, effectively protecting them from judicial review by the Constitutional Court. There have even been cases where a provision that had been previously declared unconstitutional by the competent Constitutional Court has subsequently been enacted as constitutional law. Needless to say, the Constitutional Court did and does not like that practice, and has declared that it might, in a not-too-distant future, consider such changes, in their entirety, as &quot;fundamental change&quot; to the Constitution, which would require a public referendum.

From 2003 to 2005, a constitutional convention (&quot;Österreich Konvent&quot;) consisting of representatives of all parties, representatives of all layers of government and many groups of Austrian society debated whether and how to reform the constitution. There was no general consensus on a draft for a new constitution, however, and some minor points that were universally agreed upon have yet to be implemented.

<text>Way Out West are an English electronic music duo comprising Jody Wisternoff and Nick Warren. Originating in Bristol, England, they rose to fame in the 1990s with their UK-charting singles &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Ajare&quot;, and their debut studio album &quot;Way Out West&quot; was released in 1997 to critical and commercial success. Their 2001 follow-up, &quot;Intensify&quot;, also garnered chart success, along with its singles &quot;The Fall&quot;, &quot;Intensify&quot; and &quot;Mindcircus&quot;, the latter of which reached number one on the UK Dance Chart.

Way Out West temporarily became a trio in 2004 with the addition of singer Omi (Emma Everett) for their third studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;. In 2009, their fourth album &quot;We Love Machine&quot; was released, and after a near eight-year hiatus, they released their fifth album &quot;Tuesday Maybe&quot; in 2017.

Additionally, they are known for their remixes for artists such as Sasha, Reel 2 Real, Paul van Dyk, Orbital, BT and Tiësto. They have produced and performed together for over twenty five years, and have both had success as solo musicians and DJs respectively.

==History==
===1992–97: &quot;Way Out West&quot;===
In the early 1990s, the duo met in a record store that Nick Warren was working in, and discovered their similar direction in music. They then initially produced music under the names Sub-Version 3 and Echo while also releasing remixes as Way Out West, as a side-project. Following the success of their remixes, Way Out West became their main project and the duo signed a deal with Deconstruction Records.

Way Out West began releasing singles in 1994, including &quot;Shoot&quot;, &quot;Montana&quot;, and &quot;Ajare&quot;. &quot;Ajare&quot; became a club hit, initially peaking at #52 in the UK Dance Chart that year. In 1996, the duo released another two singles: &quot;Domination&quot;, and the UK Top 15 hit, &quot;The Gift&quot; (which sampled Joanna Law&#x27;s cover version of &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;). &quot;The Gift&quot; would later be used for the title theme of the MTV television show &quot;True Life&quot;.

On 1 September 1997, the duo released their eponymous debut studio album, &quot;Way Out West&quot;. The album included most of their previous singles, and also spawned the singles &quot;Blue&quot; (a reinterpretation of the theme from the film &quot;Withnail and I&quot;), and a 1997 re-release of &quot;Ajare&quot;, which achieved greater success than the original, charting at position #36 in the UK.

===2000–02: &quot;Intensify&quot;===
On 27 November 2000, Way Out West released their single, &quot;The Fall&quot;, (which sampled Coldcut&#x27;s cover of &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;) through BMG; the former parent company of the group&#x27;s previous label Deconstruction (defunct in 1998). &quot;The Fall&quot; peaked at #61 on the UK Singles Chart and was followed by the group&#x27;s final release on BMG, the &quot;UB Devoid&quot; EP. Two of the EP&#x27;s tracks would later go on to feature on their then-upcoming album.

On 20 August 2001, Way Out West released their second studio album, &quot;Intensify&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was marked by a move from the defunct Deconstruction Records to Distinctive Records, and a change in their sound, from club instrumentals and sampled vocals to a mixture of club tracks and original songs. Singles from the album included &quot;The Fall&quot;, &quot;Mindcircus&quot; (which reached number 1 in the UK Dance Chart), and the club hit &quot;Intensify&quot;. &quot;Activity&quot; from this release also appeared in the 2001 PlayStation 2 game &quot;Kinetica&quot; and the Paul van Dyk album &quot;The Politics of Dancing&quot;.

===2003–04: &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;===
In 2003, the duo released the song &quot;Killa&quot;, which was later remixed by Orkidea and gained club popularity. &quot;Killa&quot; was also featured the 2005 video game &quot;Juiced&quot;.

In 2004, Way Out West became a trio with the addition of vocalist Omi (Emma Everett), the group&#x27;s only ever third member.

Later that year, the group then released their third studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot;. Excluding &quot;Killa&quot;, the album spawned two singles: &quot;Anything but You&quot; (featured in the video game &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07&quot;) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot; (featured in season two of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;). Other songs from the album include &quot;Melt&quot; (appeared in &quot;The O.C.&quot; as well as the season 2 episode &quot;Bones of Contention&quot; for the series &quot;Numb3rs&quot;), and &quot;Just Like a Man&quot; (appeared on season 3, episode 8 of &quot;&quot;).

===2008–10: &quot;We Love Machine&quot;===
In 2008, Way Out West contributed the song &quot;Evelina&quot; to the Survival International charity album, &quot;Songs for Survival&quot;.

In 2009, Way Out West returned as a duo and moved to the label Hope Recordings, of which Nick Warren continues to be the A&amp;R manager. The duo&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;We Love Machine&quot;, was released on 5 October 2009. The song &quot;Only Love&quot; with Jonathan Mendelsohn performing vocals (their first collaboration with a male vocalist) was the first single from the album, released on 31 August 2009, followed by &quot;Future Perfect&quot; on 7 December. The album was released on Hope Recordings and Armada Music.

In April 2010, Deconstruction Records re-released &quot;The Gift&quot; together with remixes by Logistics, Gui Boratto, Tek-One and Michael Woods; Way Out West themselves also recorded a new remix of the track.

Later that year, &quot;We Love Machine – The Remixes&quot; was released via Hope Recordings. The release featured remixes of tracks from &quot;We Love Machine&quot; by producers such as Scuba, Henry Saiz, Jaytech and D. Ramirez.

===2017–present: &quot;Tuesday Maybe&quot;===
In April 2017, Way Out West announced their fifth studio album &quot;Tuesday Maybe&quot;, with the release of three web-exclusive singles: &quot;Oceans&quot; (featuring Liu Bei), &quot;The Call&quot; (featuring Doe Paoro) and &quot;Slam&quot;. The album also features their 2016 singles &quot;Tuesday Maybe&quot; and &quot;Set My Mind&quot;. The album was released on 16 June 2017 through Anjunadeep.

In January 2018, Wisternoff hosted a Reddit AMA and hinted at upcoming work from Way Out West, claiming &quot;Me and Nick are working on new material together&quot;. He also announced a then upcoming remix album for &quot;Tuesday Maybe&quot;. On 2 February 2018, the remix album, &quot;Tuesday Maybe (Remixed)&quot;, was released on digital download stores.

In 2018, Way Out West announced a five track EP comprising chill-out remixes of songs from &quot;Tuesday Maybe&quot;, titled &quot;Sunday Maybe&quot;. The EP&#x27;s release was supported by the single &quot;Sunday Maybe&quot; on 3 April 2018, and was released on 20 April, on Anjunadeep.

<doc id="1279986" wikidata="Q3922911" url="?curid=1279986" title="Promised Land (Chuck Berry song)">
<text>&quot;Promised Land&quot; is a song lyric written by Chuck Berry to the melody of &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;, an American folk song. The song was first recorded in this version by Berry in 1964 for his album &quot;St. Louis to Liverpool&quot;. Released in December 1964, it was Berry&#x27;s fourth single issued following his prison term for a Mann Act conviction. The record peaked at #41 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on January 16, 1965.

==Background==
Berry wrote the song while in prison, and borrowed an atlas from the prison library to plot the itinerary. In the lyrics, the singer (who refers to himself as &quot;the poor boy&quot;) tells of his journey from Norfolk, Virginia, to the &quot;Promised Land&quot;, Los Angeles, California, mentioning various cities in Southern states that he passes through on his journey. Describing himself as a &quot;poor boy,&quot; the protagonist boards a Greyhound bus in Norfolk, Virginia that passes Raleigh, N.C., stops in Charlotte, North Carolina, and bypasses Rock Hill, South Carolina. The bus rolls out of Atlanta but breaks down, leaving him stranded in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. He then takes a train &quot;across Mississippi clean&quot; to New Orleans. From there, he goes to Houston, where &quot;the people there who care a bit about me&quot; buy him a silk suit, luggage and a plane ticket to Los Angeles. Upon landing in Los Angeles, he calls Norfolk, Virginia (&quot;Tidewater four, ten-oh-nine&quot;) to tell the folks back home he made it to the &quot;promised land.&quot; The lyric: &quot;Swing low, sweet chariot, come down easy/Taxi to the terminal zone&quot; refers to the gospel lyric: &quot;Swing low, sweet Chariot, coming for to carry me Home&quot; since both refer to a common destination, &quot;The Promised Land,&quot; which in this case is California, reportedly a heaven on earth.

&quot;Billboard&quot; called the song a &quot;true blue Berry rocker with plenty of get up and go,&quot; adding that &quot;rinky piano and wailing Berry electric guitar fills all in neatly.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a &#x27;pull-out-all-the-stops&#x27; rocker that Chuck pounds out solid sales authority&quot; and &quot;a real mover that should head out for hit territory in no time flat.&quot; In 2021, it was listed at No. 342 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="1279988" wikidata="Q607936" url="?curid=1279988" title="Stéphane Quintal">
<text>Stéphane Yvon Quintal (born October 22, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 16 seasons. He served as senior vice president of player safety for the NHL from 2014 to 2016.

==Playing career==
Quintal played 16 NHL seasons before retiring as a player in August 2005. He had been the last Montreal Canadiens player to wear number 5 before the Canadiens retired it in honour of Bernie &quot;Boom-Boom&quot; Geoffrion.

Quintal joined the Department of Player Safety, one of the NHL&#x27;s disciplinary arms, at its creation at the opening of the 2011–12 season. The head of the department was initially Brendan Shanahan, who left his position after the completion of the 2013–14 regular season to become president of the Toronto Maple Leafs. At the time, Quintal became the head of the department on an interim basis. On September 8, 2014, the NHL named Quintal the permanent head of the department with the title of senior vice president of player safety. Quintal continued Shanahan&#x27;s practice of releasing videos explaining his rulings on plays that were sent to the league office for review. However, he only narrated French-language videos for incidents involving the Canadiens or Ottawa Senators, a practice dating to when Shanahan ran the department. All other videos were narrated by a deputy, Patrick Burke. He held the post until 2016, when he was succeeded by George Parros.

==Director of Player Safety==
After taking over the job from Brendan Shanahan on April 11, 2014, Quintal was quickly faced with a repeat offender in the form of Minnesota Wild forward Matt Cooke. Cooke had kneed Colorado Avalanche defenseman Tyson Barrie during round one of the 2014 playoffs, ending his season. Cooke received a 7-game suspension and returned for round two of the playoffs.

<doc id="1280004" wikidata="Q5471196" url="?curid=1280004" title="Fort Garry (electoral district)">
<text>Fort Garry is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba that existed from 1958 to 2011 and was re-created in 2019. It was first created by redistribution in 1957 from parts of Iberville, Assiniboia and St. Boniface, and formally existed beginning with the 1958 provincial election. The riding is in the south-central and southwestern region of the city of Winnipeg. It is named for the historical Fort Garry which was occupied by supporters of Louis Riel during the Red River Rebellion of 1870.

Fort Garry was bordered to the east by Riel and St. Vital (across the Red River of the North), to the south by St. Norbert, to the north by Lord Roberts, and to the west by Fort Whyte. It was a mostly middle-class residential area, with some small businesses. It contained the University of Manitoba&#x27;s main campus until electoral redistribution in 2008 took effect at the 2011 Manitoba general election, placing the campus in the new district of Fort Richmond.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,383. In 1999, the average family income was $50,720, and the unemployment rate was 6.40% (though, conversely, it may be noted that 26% of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income). Over 16% of Fort Garry&#x27;s residents were immigrants, with 5% listing German as their ethnic origin. Almost 23% of the riding&#x27;s residents have a university degree.

The service sector accounted for 17% of Fort Garry&#x27;s industry, with a further 12% each in the retail trade and educational services.

Historically, Fort Garry was a safe seat for the Progressive Conservatives, who represented the riding from 1958 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 2003. Future Premier Sterling Lyon was Fort Garry&#x27;s first member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). In the provincial election of 1999, however, the New Democratic Party (NDP) came within only 30 votes of winning the riding. They made it their primary target in the 2003 election, and won it for the first time in their history.

Fort Garry&#x27;s last MLA before dissolution was Kerri Irvin-Ross of the NDP, who was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election with 53% of the vote.

Following the 2008 electoral boundary redistribution, Fort Garry was abolished. Most of its territory was divided between the new ridings of Fort Garry-Riverview and Fort Richmond, with a smaller portion going to St. Norbert.

Following the 2018 redistribution, the riding was re-created from Fort Garry-Riverview, Fort Rouge, River Heights, and Fort Richmond. Fort Garry was contested in the 2019 provincial election. It is bordered by River Heights to the northwest, Fort Rouge to the northeast, St. Vital to the east, Riel to the southeast, Fort Richmond to the south, Waverley to the southwest, and Fort Whyte to the west.

<doc id="1280017" wikidata="Q5429882" url="?curid=1280017" title="Fair Packaging and Labeling Act">
<text>The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act is a U.S. law that applies to labels on many consumer products. It requires the label to state:

*The identity of the product;
*The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; and
*The net quantity of contents.

The contents statement must include both metric and U.S. customary units.

Passed under Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966, the law first took effect on July 1, 1967. The metric labeling requirement was added in 1992 and took effect on February 14, 1994. The law is codified as .

There has been an effort by industry threatened by a European Union directive that would force metric-only labeling starting January 1, 2010, to amend the FPLA to allow manufacturers to use metric-only labeling. An amendment to indefinitely delay metric-only labeling was adopted by the European Commission September 10, 2007, approved by the European Parliament November 29, 2007, and by the European Economic and Social Committee December 12, 2007.

== Background of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act ==

The introduction to Act states that &quot;Informed consumers are essential to the fair and efficient functioning of a free market economy.&quot; Here, Congress makes it clear that they are invested in making sure that American shoppers are knowledgeable about the products that they are purchasing in American stores. Senator Philip Hart (D-MI) introduced the Act in the Senate by stating, &quot;The consumer has a right to be able to find out what he is buying, how much he is buying, what it is costing on a per unit basis.&quot; Senator Hart earned the nickname &quot;The Conscience of the Senate&quot; from his peers for his tendency to stand up for the average person, defending their rights, and take on big business. Senator Hart worked hard on this bill, he was a strong driving force behind the bill, and he likely knew more about the act than anyone.

The issue of misleading labels and packages had been one ongoing problem as, &quot;Individual consumers have complained for years about confusing labels, shoddy workmanship, dresses that fall apart at the seams, deceptive packaging, &quot;cents off&quot; promotions, high-interest rates.&quot; These frustrated consumers sent thousands of letters to Congress requesting solutions. One reason for why this popular discussion emerged at this time was Americans could choose among an unprecedented assortment of products when they went shopping. In the average supermarket in the mid-1960s, a consumer would find 8,000 items, which was more than five times the 1,500 items they found in that same market just 20 years previously.

Before this Act was passed, measurements regarding quantity of goods were not required on packages, there was also no standards in place assuring that similar products had equivalent weights, and there were no regulations in place pledging that packages had a consistent amount of product every time. An investigation was done by the Senate committee that discovered that the manufacturers of potato chips sent them to market in a variation of 73 different weights under 3 pounds.&quot; President Johnson voiced his opinion several times on the issue, discussing a common problem, &quot;The housewife often needs a scale, a yardstick and a slide rule to make a rational choice. She has enough to do without performing mathematics in the stores.&quot; It was hard to know just how much of an ingredient was needed for a recipe, for example. President Johnson also proclaims, &quot;The Government must do its share to ensure the shopper against deception, to remedy confusion, and to eliminate questionable practices.&quot; Johnson was a strong supporter of this act and he believed that it was the government&#x27;s responsibility to do something to help the American consumer.

== Legislative History ==
The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act was originally introduced in the House on January 3, 1961. The bill lost momentum but was eventually re-introduced into the Senate on February 3, 1965 and it was debated in the Senate first. Senator Philip Hart (MI) introduced the legislation, as he was a main proponent. He also introduced the legislation on behalf of Senators Bartlett, Metcalf, Mondale, Muskie, and Neuberger. The bill was debated for the first time, in the Senate, on May 27, 1966. It was later passed to the House on June 9, 1966. On October 3, 1966, the House made a few amendments and then passed it back to the Senate. The Senate disagreed to these amendments and asked for a conference. A conference report was later created and then submitted to the House, where it was agreed to. The conference report was then submitted in the Senate and agreed to. After, the bill was sent to President Johnson to be signed. When Johnson signed the Fair Packaging Act, he did so alongside three other bills, two education bills and a &quot;slum rehabilitation program&quot; bill. After he signed what he called the &quot;landmark health and education bills&quot;, he publicly stated that the four bills would &quot;help us maintain our vitality here at home,&quot; and that they &quot;will act as a beacon of hope to people around the world.&quot;

== Provisions of The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act ==
The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act required all &quot;consumer commodities&quot; to have a label. Under the act, consumer commodities were defined as any food, drug, device, or cosmetic, that is produced or distributed for sale through retails sales/agencies for consumption by individuals or used by individuals for the purpose of personal care. Further, labels were defined as any written, printed, or graphic matter affixed to a consumer commodity or affixed to a package containing any consumer commodities.

<text>Jean-Jérôme Adam (8 June 1904 – 11 July 1981) was the French Roman Catholic archbishop of Libreville, Gabon, and an accomplished linguist who studied several of the languages of Gabon.

He was born at Wittenheim in Alsace and educated in the seminaries of the Holy Ghost Fathers. He arrived in Gabon on 29 September 1929, and spent the next 18 years as a missionary in the Haut-Ogooué Province. During that time he prepared grammars for the Mbédé, Ndumu, and Duma languages.

In 1947, Adam was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Libreville and bishop of the titular see of Rhinocorura; he became bishop of Libreville when it was elevated to a diocese in 1955, and he was made archbishop of the see in 1958. He retired in 1969 and moved to Franceville, where he died in 1981.

<doc id="1280042" wikidata="Q66085" url="?curid=1280042" title="Timo Maas">
<text>Timo Maas (born July 27, 1969) is a German DJ/producer and remixer. His remix of Azzido Da Bass&#x27;s single &quot;Dooms Night&quot; helped launch his career in 2000.

In its wake, he also released &quot;Music for the Maases Volume 1&quot;, a mix album consisting of many of his previous tracks and remixes. After another mix album called &quot;Connected&quot; for Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s imprint Perfecto, Maas released his own debut studio album &quot;Loud&quot; in 2002. The album was produced by German dance music producer Martin Buttrich (also known for his work with Loco Dice), and featured guest appearances from Kelis, Neneh Cherry and Placebo&#x27;s Brian Molko.

In a career spanning over 30 years, Maas has been collaborated with and remixed many artists such as Paul McCartney, Depeche Mode, Finley Quaye, Fatboy Slim, Garbage, Jamiroquai, Madonna, Moby, Moloko, Muse, Roger Sanchez and Tori Amos. In 2016, Maas and his producing partner James Teej, received a Grammy nomination (the second in Maas&#x27;s career) for their work on Paul McCartney &amp; Wings&#x27; track &quot;Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five&quot;.

In 2008, Maas launched his own record label called Rockets &amp; Ponies releasing productions from artists such as Wolfgang Haffner, Ricardo Villalobos, Maetrik, Nightmares on Wax and Addison Groove.

In addition to his productions, Maas has been a longtime DJ, having been a resident at the legendary Ibiza nightclub DC10 for over 15 years and having also played in clubs such as Ushuaia, The End, Twilo, Tresor, Tunnel and many more.

==Career==
===Early years (1982–1998)===
Maas bought his first set of turntables at the age of 17, and played his very first DJ set in 1982 at a party in his friend&#x27;s home. The beginning of his career consisted mostly of gigs around Germany playing &quot;top 40&quot; records with the occasional techno record sneaked in, but it was to be another 6 years from his debut DJ performance before he would perform his first official all-techno set. In 1992, Maas was introduced to the early German rave scene, and he went on to DJ at many different rave events both in Germany and elsewhere, earning a name in the electronic underground scene.

Maas&#x27; first record, &quot;The Final XS&quot;, was released in 1995. His second record release, &quot;Die Herdplatte&quot;, was a collaboration with another producer, Gary D, which was a bigger success than his first. Gary D also gained Maas a residency at Hamburg&#x27;s famous club The Tunnel, between 1994 and 1996. Through his British contact Leon Alexander, Maas played at the Bristol club Lakota and held a residency there for three years. Maas also began to release records through record labels such as Hope Recordings, both under his own name and the alias, Orinoko, arguably the biggest record of which was titled &quot;Mama Konda&quot;. The track received wide support from DJs including Sasha, Carl Cox and Morales and reached the top 20 in both the UK and US charts. Maas has also recorded under many aliases such as Mad Dogs among others together with his manager and friend Leon Alexander. In 2000, Maas began a residency alongside Deep Dish at the New York City club, Twilo.

===&quot;Doom&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;Loud&quot; and &quot;Pictures&quot; (1999–2005)===
A turning point in Maas&#x27;s career was remixing Azzido Da Bass&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Doom&#x27;s Night&quot;. Co-remixed with Martin Buttrich in a 3-hour session after Azzido Da Bass rejected their first attempt, it reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart and sold over half a million copies worldwide. Following that, Maas decided to release a compilation CD containing only tracks produced or remixed by him, titled &quot;Music for the Maases&quot;, and having the remix of &quot;Doom&#x27;s Night&quot; as its opening track. The compilation also features a remix for Muse&#x27;s &quot;Sunburn&quot; and has said to have been put together with the American audiences in mind.

In 2001, Maas and Buttrich started working on Maas&#x27;s debut album, which saw its release in 2002 on Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s label Perfecto, and was titled &quot;Loud&quot;. It was generally well-received, averaging at 71 (out of 100) on Metacritic. The first track, &quot;Help Me&quot;, features vocals by Kelis and also contains a sample of the title music from &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, composed by Bernard Hermann. The album features other guest performers such as MC Chickaboo, Martin Bettinghaus, and Finley Quaye. The 10th track on the album, &quot;To Get Down&quot;, has been used in several film soundtracks and other mediums such as the 2003 remake of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, &quot;Riders&quot; (now known as &quot;Steal&quot;) in 2002, a Budweiser beer commercial and the &quot;FIFA 2003&quot; video game. Maas has described his debut album as forward-thinking, bridging the gap between electronic and mainstream music: &quot;It&#x27;s not just about bringing dance music to a wider audience. I see the whole thing as something very open-minded. You hope alternative rock and dance can come together, and I think it&#x27;s going to be really good.&quot;

Maas and Buttrich continued to do remix work, most notably remixing Tori Amos&#x27; track &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Come to Vegas&quot;, off her 2003 album &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot;.

The track was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Awards in the non-classical remixed recording category. The same year, Maas also remixed the Depeche Mode track &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;.

In 2005, Maas released his second studio album, titled &quot;Pictures&quot; on Warner Bros.&#x27;s sub-label Hope Recordings. It was co-produced with Martin Buttrich over a two-year period in their studio in Hannover. The album featured many artist collaborations such as Kelis, Neneh Cherry and Placebo lead singer Brian Molko.

===Balance compilation, residency at DC10 and &quot;Lifer&quot; (2005–2013)===
Over the coming years after their 2005 LP &quot;Pictures&quot;, Timo Maas and Martin Buttrich continued to work together on various projects, but ultimately the pair&#x27;s musical direction went amicably in different directions. Maas met his next production partner Santos in 2007 at a gig in Rome. Together they formed a new alias called Mutant Clan, under which they proceeded to release several releases, as well as put together a double CD compilation for the acclaimed Balance Mix Series in 2010. The pair worked on sourcing the tracks, recording special edits and track-listing for four months. The same year, Maas also started his label, originally in partnership with Santos, called &#x27;Rockets &amp; Ponies&quot;, which received support from the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Carl Cox and Tiesto. 2013 saw the release of Timo&#x27;s third artist album, titled &quot;Lifer&quot;, on his Rockets &amp; Ponies imprint. True to Maas&#x27;s manner, it featured cameos from different artists such as Katie Cruel, James Lavelle of Unkle and a return by Maas&#x27;s longtime friend Brian Molko. For Lavelle, this was the only vocal outside of Unkle that he had ever done. On working with Katie Cruel, Maas claimed to have been touched by the soul and emotion of her voice. Of the album and working Santos, Maas has said: &quot;I really like working with Santos, as we both inspire each other a lot and we are trying to push boundaries on a constant basis. The album &#x27;Lifer&#x27; is one of the results of this vibe.&quot;

Over the next few years, Timo proceeded to release more singles. Following the release of his track &quot;Dancing for My Pleasure&quot; on the Canadian electronic music label My Favorite Robot, Timo proceeded to do a mix for their compilation series titled ‘Crossing Wires 002’ containing mostly unreleased material from other producers., The release was followed by a North-American tour by the same name in 2014. The same year, Timo was commissioned to do a remix for Morcheeba’s &quot;Make Believer&quot; followed by a collaborative remix work on Róisín Murphy’s &quot;Jealousy&quot; with one-third of My Favorite Robot, James Teej, in 2015. Maas and Teej continued their collaborative partnership with a release on Crosstown Rebels&#x27; sub-label Rebellion called ‘Thingzz’.

Aside from his release-work, Timo has also been a resident at the legendary Ibiza nightclub DC10 (nightclub), having played his first show there in 2001. Maas has said that it is the only club in the world where he can be himself and express his vision and he has called it the most original and unique experience one can have when going to the island.

===&quot;Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five&quot; (2016–present)===
In 2009 Maas and his agent, David Levy, had a listening session in Ibiza playing each other different tracks that they liked. Timo heard the original Paul McCartney and Wings track played to him by Levy and expressed his wish to get the stems for the track. David Levy, through his connections to McCartney&#x27;s management, delivered the studio session, complete with all the stems, to Maas. Over the proceeding few months, Maas tried working on the stems with different people after a while the project went back on the shelf. 
It was only a few years later when Maas played the unfinished work to his good friend and My Favorite Robot label head James Teej that the pair felt they could do something with it. The duo spent a week listening to different parts and working intensely on the track until it was finished. The track was sent to McCartney&#x27;s team from whom it got the approval for release.

What followed was a marketing strategy generated by Maas&#x27;s management that saw the vinyl being released as an unknown white label with only Paul McCartney&#x27;s face stamped on it on the Phonica Records website. The vinyl-run was limited and sold out in a few hours, having its prices soar to upwards $400 on eBay and other websites and going #1 on Phonica Records’ website. There was some speculation whether the vinyl was officially sanctioned by McCartney himself, but it eventually got conclusive proof on its origins. The story of its overnight success got quickly picked up by major publications such as &quot;i-D&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone Germany&quot;, and &quot;Clash Magazine&quot;.

The track was positively received and played by many industry heavyweights such as Pete Tong, Annie Mac, Seth Troxler and Damian Lazarus. The inspiration behind the remix was to come up with a modern take of a classic song with respect to the original, with more emphasis on the bass and reinforcing McCartney&#x27;s blues-inspired vocals.

The record got its official release on Virgin in June 2016, followed by a remix package featuring versions from Paul Woolford, Kerri Chandler and Tim Green.

The official video features clips of McCartney performing the original track in the 1970s, as well as two young dancers performing an intricate choreography interpreting the lyrics and theme of the song. The video was directed by London-based Can Evgin and choreographer by Aaron Sillis, noted for his work with FKA Twigs and MIA.

In December 2016, it was announced that Maas&#x27;s and Teej&#x27;s remix had been nominated at the 59th Grammy Awards in the best remix category.

==Influences==

Maas has cited early 1980s music with a lot of funk, soul and disco as well as Jean Michel Jarre and his albums &quot;Oxygène&quot;, &quot;Equinoxe&quot;, and &quot;Magnetic Fields&quot; as early influences on him.

He has also claimed to be influenced by James Lavelle and is a fan of old-school rock such as Led Zeppelin and Dire Straits as well as newer rock musicians such as Lenny Kravitz.

<text>A harmonic tremor is a sustained release of seismic and infrasonic energy typically associated with the underground movement of magma, the venting of volcanic gases from magma, or both in volcanoes, and with repetitive stick-slip or other impulsive activity in non-volcanic systems. It is a long-duration release of seismic energy, often containing distinct spectral lines. Volcanic tremor often precedes or accompanies a volcanic eruption. Being a long-duration continuous signal from a temporally extended source tremor contrasts distinctly with transient and often impulsive sources of seismic radiation typically associated with earthquakes and explosions.

Nonvolcanic, episodic tremor at plate boundaries (particularly in subduction zones) has been attributed to swarms of long-period earthquakes and is distinguished by the term episodic tremor and slip (ETS) and may occur during slow earthquakes.

Iceberg impacts with the seafloor or other icebergs can also generate distinct iceberg harmonic tremor signals that propagate to large distances as ocean acoustic and solid Earth seismic wavefields. The source process of iceberg harmonic tremor has been attributed to highly repetitive quasi-periodic stick-slip at ice-seafloor or ice-ice contacts.

The relation between long-period events and an imminent eruption was first observed by Bernard Chouet, a volcanologist who was working at the United States Geological Survey.
