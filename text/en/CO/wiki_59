<text>Barry Gordon (born December 21, 1948) is an American actor and political talk show host. He was the longest-serving president of the Screen Actors Guild, having served from 1988 to 1995. He is perhaps best known as the original voice of Donatello and Bebop in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; franchise.

==Early life==
Gordon was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, United States. Gordon is Jewish. His stepfather, Bob Manning, was a crooner of popular love songs in the 1940s and 1950s, most known for his rendition of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;The Nearness of You&quot;.

==Acting==

===Childhood career===
Gordon began performing at age three; in his television debut, he won second place on Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;Amateur Hour&quot; singing Johnnie Ray&#x27;s &quot;Cry&quot;. At six, Gordon recorded &quot;Nuttin&#x27; for Christmas&quot;. He was the youngest performer to hit a pre-Hot 100 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart when that song hit No. 6 in 1955. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The next year, he charted his second and final single &quot;Rock Around Mother Goose&quot;. In circa 1956, Bill Haley recorded a private demo recording &quot;Six Year Olds Can Rock and Roll&quot;. He begins the recording (released in 1990) by dedicating it to Barry Gordon.

As a child actor, Gordon also appeared on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;, &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;Star Time&quot; with Benny Goodman. Gordon was cast as Humberto in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Sally&quot;, starring Joan Caulfield, and as Chopper in &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; (episode 119: &quot;Beaver&#x27;s House Guest&quot;). Gordon guest starred on the sitcoms &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot; and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;.

In 1962, he played the part of the childhood version of &quot;Patient&quot; in &quot;Pressure Point&quot;. At 13, Gordon began a career on Broadway as Nick in Herb Gardner&#x27;s &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, a role for which he earned a Tony Award nomination. He later reprised that role in the film version opposite Jason Robards and Martin Balsam in 1965. The film gave him &quot;introducing&quot; billing, but he had actually been in several films already, most notably his actual film debut in 1956&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; as a newspaper boy in which, after seeing Jayne Mansfield, he uttered the line: &quot;If that&#x27;s a girl, I don&#x27;t know what my sister is.&quot;

===Adult roles===
As a teen, Gordon starred alongside Sid Caesar and Vera Miles in the 1967 comedy-horror film &quot;The Spirit Is Willing&quot;. In the 1970s, Gordon appeared in the &quot;Barney Miller&quot; spin-off &quot;Fish&quot;, starring Abe Vigoda, and from 1973 to 1974 was a regular on &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. He also played a waiter in &quot;Horror in the Heights&quot;, a 1974 episode of &quot;&quot;. In 1976, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Practice&quot;.

===Character actor===
Primarily as a character actor, Gordon became a familiar face in numerous feature films and television series. In the last two seasons of the sitcom &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, Gordon had the recurring role of Gary Rabinowitz, Archie&#x27;s Jewish attorney and love interest of Barbara Lee &quot;Billie&quot; Bunker (played by Denise Miller, who had also co-starred with Gordon in &quot;Fish&quot;). Gordon also had notable guest-starring roles on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; as an embezzler, on &quot;Fish&quot; as a social worker, on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; as a Ferengi businessman, and on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as Ardon Broht, an alien publisher. More recently, he appeared as the Rabbi in Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

===Voice work===
Gordon worked extensively as a voice actor. His most notable voice roles were Donatello and Bebop in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, and as Jake &quot;Razor&quot; Clawson in &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot; (1993). Gordon&#x27;s voice was also featured in other animated series, mostly Hanna-Barbera shows such as &quot;Jabberjaw&quot; (as Clamhead), &quot;Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot; (as Captain Marvel Jr.), &quot;Meatballs &amp; Spaghetti&quot; (as bassist Clyde), &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (as Inky), &quot;Mighty Orbots&quot; (as Robert Simmons), &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of the American Rabbit&quot; (as the titular character), &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot; (as Junior Wetworth), &quot;Gravedale High&quot; (as Reggie Moonshroud), &quot;Space Cats&quot;, &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; (as Englebert Newton), &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (as Dr. Fossil), &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Droopy, Master Detective&quot;, &quot;&quot; (as the Penguin&#x27;s henchman Sheldrake), &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot;, &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Max&quot;, and &quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&quot;. Gordon also provided the voice of &quot;Quicky&quot; the Nesquik Bunny in television commercials for Nestlé.

In May 2009, Gordon played the Cocker Spaniel in the Webkinz Pet of the Month Music Video for May 2009. He reprised the roles as the original Donatello and Bebop in three seasons of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.

On April 20, 2022, it was revealed that Gordon would reprise his role as Donatello for the video game, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. This marks the first time that he would play Donatello for a video game and his first video game role in general.

In his mid-30s, Gordon returned to school; he graduated summa cum laude as a political science major from California State University, Los Angeles and went on to Loyola Law School, receiving his J.D. in 1991.

In 2005, Gordon hosted a weekly radio talk show heard on KRLA in Los Angeles, California.

With live streams and podcast archives, the show was notable for featuring nationally known guests, including senators, congressmen, bestselling authors, and entertainment figures.

Since 2007, Gordon has taught courses in politics and the media at the California State University, Los Angeles.

In 2008, Gordon debuted his daily Internet talk show &quot;Left Talk&quot; on BlogTalkRadio.

<text>Gütersloh () is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in the region of Ostwestfalen-Lippe and the administrative region of Detmold. Gütersloh is the administrative centre for a district of the same name and has a population of 100,194 people.

== Geography ==
Gütersloh lies in the Emssandebene, south-west of the Teutoburg Forest and on the north-eastern edge of the Westphalian Basin and has no significant points of elevation. The town&#x27;s lowest point is above sea level on the river Ems near the Princess Royal Barracks and the highest point is above sea level in the eastern township of Friedrichsdorf.

The border to Rheda-Wiedenbrück extends as part of the Rhedaer Forest, a large wooded area with predominantly conifers. The river Dalke flows through the town from east to west, crossing close to the Stadt Park as well as the town centre and river Ems.

Gütersloh railway station is on the Hamm–Minden line.

== History ==
The then-official district of Gütersloh included the town of the same name. It also included seven other municipalities: Avenwedde, Ebbesloh, Friedrichsdorf, Hollen, Isselhorst, Niehorst and Spexard; which existed until 1969 and were incorporated as part of the 1969 North Rhine-Westphalian municipal reform. Currently, all of them are now municipal sub-division units within Gütersloh&#x27;s borders.

== Politics ==
=== Mayor ===

Since 1949 there is an amphitheater with 1,100 seats. The name comes from the owner, Frederike Mohn, from whom the town bought the park in 1937. There is also the small Riegerpark (named after the Rieger nursery) and the park of the LWL-clinic (built 1911–14, with many listed buildings and a small deer park).

===Football===
The oldest Westphalian football club, the Gymnasial-Spielverein Gütersloh, was founded in 1878 at the Evangelisch Stiftisches Gymnasium.

FC Gütersloh 2000 (FCG) had a spell in the 2. Fußball-Bundesliga from 1996 to 1999 before being relegated and dissolved by a court due to an overwhelming debt of 7 million DM. The club was re-established in 2000. The women&#x27;s team plays as FSV Gütersloh 2009 in the 2. Bundesliga while the men&#x27;s team plays in the Oberliga Westfalen, the fifth league. The FSV Gütersloh 2009 organizes the Gütersloher Hallenmasters, Germany&#x27;s biggest international cup for U17-teams. There is also the Strenge-Cup, one of the biggest cups in Ostwestfalen-Lippe for teenagers.

A great event in the history of Gütersloh was the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Being an official training area, the Heidewaldstadion was used three times by the Portugal national football team. Up to 5,000 fans came to watch the games on the biggest video screen in Ostwestfalen-Lippe in front of the town hall. Gütersloh was one of the very few towns in Germany where the FIFA World Cup Trophy was shown. Many people also had a job-related connection to the World Cup, because many articles like books, magazines or posters were produced in Gütersloh by Bertelsmann.

=== RAF Gütersloh ===

A Royal Air Force station in Gütersloh was home of RAF Squadrons 2 and 4, which flew Hawker Hunter photo reconnaissance aircraft, then 19 and 92 Sqn, which flew Lightnings, and later 3 and 4, which flew the distinctive VSTOL Harrier. They were supported by 18 Squadron operating Chinook Helicopters and 230 Squadron, which flew Puma Helicopters. There were also personnel at the station from the RAF Regiment who provided Rapier ground to air missile support. It was the most easterly of Nato&#x27;s airbases during the Cold War.

The station was originally built for the Luftwaffe who flew Junkers bombers from the station and the runway was extended during this period using the labour of Soviet prisoners of war, a memorial to whom now stands near Junkers Farm, a farm building that was later used as a Scout hut within the station&#x27;s perimeter fence. The farm building is now condemned, and the scouts use a larger building on Mansergh Barracks instead, but the scouts still use the area near the building during the summer, and the memorial is still mentioned on camps. RAF Gütersloh closed in 1993.

=== Princess Royal Barracks, Gütersloh ===
The British Army took over RAF Gütersloh in 1993 and renamed it Princess Royal Barracks, Gütersloh. It housed regiments of the Royal Logistic Corps, Army Air Corps and 114 Provost Company, Royal Military Police. 

=== Mansergh Barracks, Gütersloh ===
There was a second barracks in Gütersloh is called Mansergh Barracks, which was on the opposite side of town to the main camp. Mansergh Barracks was on the Verler Strasse near Spexard, it held a British secondary school called King&#x27;s School and a primary school called Haig School for the armed forces. Mansergh Barracks was home to 40 Field Regiment, then 47 Field Regiment and finally, 26th Regiment Royal Artillery. During the time of the RAF base on the opposite side of town, there was also 10 Field Squadron, Royal Engineers (Harrier Support Squadron) and one Royal Army Ordnance Corps company which changed its name from 1 OFP to 1CTOC and finally 61 Ordnance Company. The Royal Engineers left when the Harrier Squadrons left Gutersloh and 61 Ordnance Company was amalgamated into the Royal Logistics Corps in 1993. The last British soldiers left Gütersloh in September 2019.

For servicemen based at RAF Guetersloh, it was &quot;Sunny Gutters&quot;.

<doc id="1290715" wikidata="Q4828195" url="?curid=1290715" title="Avenue Grounds">
<text>Avenue Grounds was a baseball field located in Cincinnati, USA. Also known as Brighton Park and Cincinnati Baseball Park, the ground was home to the Cincinnati Reds baseball club from April 25, 1876, to August 27, 1879. The ballpark featured a grandstand that could seat up to 3,000 fans. It was approximately north of the Union Grounds, where the original professional team from the area, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, played, and was approximately from the heart of the city, so horse-drawn streetcars and trains were a popular way to travel to the park. The ballpark had first opened in , and would continue to be used for various types of amateur sports until at least the mid-1890s. The major league club of 1876–1879 played poorly, and actually dropped out of the league after the 1879 season. The club revived for 1880, and relocated to the Bank Street Grounds.

==Location==

Little is known about this ballpark, as even its location is somewhat sketchy. Contemporary atlases indicate the &quot;Base Ball Grounds&quot; was about two short blocks west of Spring Grove Avenue, bounded on the south by Alabama Avenue, on the west by Mill Creek, on the north by the imaginary line extending from Monmouth Street, and on the immediate east by the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad tracks. It was a block north of the stockyards, and was straight west of the Cincinnati Work House, which was on the northeast corner of Alabama and Colerain, and which served as the jail.

The Cincinnati &quot;Enquirer&quot; for July 13, 1875, page 4, reported on the planned new ballpark: &quot;Eight acres (the old Union Grounds contained about four) have been leased north of the Stock Yards and west of the Marietta Railroad, which road will build a station at this point and carry passengers the round trip for 15 cents. $12,000 will be spent in fitting up the grounds with a seating capacity of 7,000, and making them the finest in the country in every way.&quot; (Local newspapers in the 19th century often termed any new ballpark as &quot;the finest in the country.&quot;)

Available Sanborn insurance maps do not have detail for the location.

After the ballpark&#x27;s days as a major league venue were over, it continued to be used for amateur baseball and for other events such as soccer and trapshooting. The &quot;Enquirer&#x27;s&quot; final mention of the ballpark, by then routinely being called the &quot;old&quot; Avenue Grounds, came on September 4, 1896, p.10, announcing an upcoming amateur ball game.

Although some sources have stated that the ballpark site became the amusement park called Chester Park, that park was located a couple of miles farther northeast on Spring Grove Avenue, T-d into by Mitchell Avenue. Recently the property near the Avenue Grounds site had been occupied by Hilshire Farms and Kahn&#x27;s, at 3241 Spring Grove. As of 2016, that site was a vacant lot. The approximate actual site of the ballpark is occupied by railroad yards.

==Ballpark amenities==
Admission onto the grounds cost 50 cents, which was lowered to 10 cents after the fifth inning. The ballpark featured such cuisine as hard-boiled eggs, ham sandwiches, and mineral water. Lemon peel-and-water drinks also sold for 10 cents. There was a special section named the &quot;Little Dukes&quot;, for those who wanted to sit near the bar. It also has the claim to Fame for holding the first Ladies&#x27; Day in Major League history, in 1876.

<doc id="1290716" wikidata="Q388143" url="?curid=1290716" title="Orlunda radio transmitter">
<text>The Orlunda longwave transmitter was a longwave broadcast facility in central Sweden which broadcast Sveriges Radio Programme 1 from 1962 to 1991. The facility is currently in use as a museum.

==Planning and construction==

The Swedish Telecom Administration Board and its technical department, Televerket, had begun plans for an upgraded longwave transmitter to serve central Sweden as early as the 1940s. The original facility, located in central Motala, was both antiquated and poorly situated; the transmitter was inefficient and staff were needed on site to operate it day and night, and signal fading occurred as close as 80 kilometres away. After numerous studies it was determined that a site east of the town of Vadstena would provide a clear signal to the surrounding area. Construction began in 1958; engineer Folke Strandén designed a ring antenna system consisting of a central mast surrounded by five antennas, to be connected to two 300 kW Compagnie Français Thomson Houston (CFTH) transmitters. The station itself was built underground in a windowless concrete bunker with 1.5-metre thick walls designed to survive a Soviet air attack. The bunker would host the power supply, transmitters, transformers, and a V-12 diesel engine to be used as a backup generator. All cables leading to and from the facility were likewise buried underground.

==Technical specifications==

The two transmitters could be used either independently or together, and featured a CFTH specialty, steam-cooled tubes called &quot;Vapotrones&quot;. They had a power efficiency of 66%.

The antenna system was designed to produce a ground wave intended to prevent interference with distant transmitters on the same frequency. The transmitter also broadcast a signal at a 40° angle; this did not affect reception, but its effect on distant stations is unknown. Programs were sent to the facility by telephone cable and were amplified before transmission. The centre antenna, 250 metres in height, was located near the station and the secondary antennas, 200 metres each in height, were arranged in a ring surrounding the station; each secondary antenna was 630 metres from the centre antenna and 630 metres from its neighbours.

Construction was completed in 1961 and the station was officially inaugurated by HRH Prince Bertil in May of that year. The station began broadcasting in 1962, after the necessary tests and adjustments had been conducted.

==Operations==

The station originally broadcast Programme 1 of Sveriges Radio, the Swedish national broadcaster, on 191 kHz. Its improved coverage and higher power provided a better signal to hundreds of thousands of listeners in central Sweden. The station was also audible in northern Sweden at night.

Some Swedes complained that it was a mistake to build an expensive longwave facility financed by license fees when the more enjoyable FM radio was gaining in popularity. Critics pointed out that many FM stations could be built for the cost of one longwave station. Televerket responded by stating that the Orlunda station was required because many of its listeners did not yet own FM receivers. However, despite Televerket&#x27;s insistence on the importance of AM broadcasting, it introduced an FM network only a few years later; the Orlunda facility was the last longwave transmitter and the second-last AM transmitter (Sölvesborg was the last) built by Televerket.

==Problems==

Soon after the station entered service, the East German international station Stimme der DDR commenced broadcasting on 185 kHz, interfering with reception at longer distances. After several complaints, the East German government moved the station&#x27;s frequency to decrease interference.

On 12 July 1970 the station&#x27;s central antenna was struck by lightning, cutting off a stay, setting an oil-filled stay insulator on fire, and crushing the base insulator. This caused the central antenna to collapse over the bunker, destroying the antenna but causing little damage to the sturdily-built bunker; only a crack in the ceiling was visible from the inside entrance. Power was lowered to 150 kW while the feeders were reconnected to the five ring antennas. The central mast was never rebuilt. When the feeders were rebuilt the power was raised again to 300 kW, but lowered again in the 1970s to 100 kW after the 1973 and 1979 oil crises. This cut listenership as it increased maintenance costs; Televerket made plans to improve Sweden&#x27;s AM radio network with five new 600 kW mediumwave transmitters and replacing Orlunda with new longwave facilities on the island of Gotland and at Mora. This would have improved coverage of northern Sweden and the Swedish speaking areas of Finland, but the plan never reached fruition.

Sveriges Radio later introduced processed sound to increase sound quality, but this had the effect of the modulation transformer almost reaching its alarm limit.

==The end==

In 1986 the station&#x27;s frequency was changed to 189 kHz to meet international standards proposed at the 1979 Geneva World Administrative Radio Conference. A rubidium oscillator was installed to stabilize the carrier. In 1987 three of the five remaining antennas were demolished as part of a military anti-sabotage exercise conducted by the Swedish Army&#x27;s Life Regiment Hussars (K 3), of which some recorded sequences can be seen in the 1987 military educational film Förebudet . The transmitter beam was later changed on the two remaining antennas to improve reception in Copenhagen and Helsinki without decreasing reception in Oslo.

Televerket conducted a survey in 1989 to gauge listenership, which revealed that only 200 people tuned in regularly. A request for 3 million Swedish krona in additional funding for transmitter maintenance was denied by the Swedish government in 1991, and it was decided shortly thereafter that the station would be shut down on 30 November of that year. Listeners had six months advance notice of the closure. The last broadcast featured a special program ending with the Swedish national anthem.

In 1994 and 1995 the two remaining antennas were dismantled.

==Today==

Everything remains at the station today except for the antennas and the V12 diesel engine. It is currently operated as a private museum which may be visited by prior appointment. The lands surrounding the station were sold back to their original owners.

<doc id="1290718" wikidata="Q1784139" url="?curid=1290718" title="Sam Totman">
<text>Ian Samuel Totman is a British-born New Zealand musician best known as guitarist and main songwriter for the power metal band DragonForce.

==Early life==
Totman was born in England and grew up mainly in New Zealand. He moved back to England around age 22 because England&#x27;s music scene offered numerous shows to attend every week—an option he did not have in geographically isolated New Zealand. He began playing classical guitar at the age of nine—receiving formal training for several years.

==Career==
In the late 80s/early 90s, Totman was the guitarist in death metal band Karnage alongside Steve Francis (now of Bulletbelt). They were based in Masterton, New Zealand and released one demo cassette &quot;Dead&quot;. Totman was part of the black power metal band Demoniac—which also featured his future DragonForce bandmate Herman Li. During his time with Demoniac Totman was referred to as Heimdall (the Norse God of vigilance). Demoniac struggled to achieve any real fame outside of Australasia despite releasing three albums and relocating to London, UK. Demoniac split sometime in late 1999 shortly after the album &quot;The Fire and the Wind&quot; was released. Most of the members went on to form power metal band DragonHeart which later became known as DragonForce. Keyboardist Steve Williams and bassist Steve Scott left Dragonheart to form Power Quest with whom Totman recorded on their demo as well as their first album &quot;Wings of Forever&quot;. Totman also provided guest instrumentation on the band&#x27;s following album &quot;Neverworld&quot;.

As the main songwriter for DragonForce, Totman has written both the music and lyrics for a majority of DragonForce&#x27;s discography.

== Playing style ==
Totman is known for his use of double handed tapping, extensive whammy bar usage, alternate picking, rapid staccato and legato scale runs, sweeping, and many other shred-guitar techniques; both in solo parts and in harmony with fellow guitarist Herman Li. Like Li, he uses many of the said techniques to emulate video game music and sounds.

<doc id="1290720" wikidata="Q1062204" url="?curid=1290720" title="Adrián Beltré">
<text>Adrián Beltré Pérez (born April 7, 1979) is a Dominican former professional baseball third baseman. During his career, Beltré played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, and Texas Rangers in Major League Baseball (MLB). He is regarded as one of the greatest third basemen of all time.

Originally signed as an amateur free agent, Beltré made his MLB debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 at age 19. He batted and threw right-handed. Beltré hit a major league-leading 48 home runs while playing for the Dodgers in 2004, was the team MVP of the Red Sox in 2010, played in the 2011 World Series as a member of the Rangers, and tied for the major league lead in hits in 2013. On September 19, 2014, Beltré surpassed Vladimir Guerrero as the all-time MLB leader for hits by a Dominican player, a record since broken by Albert Pujols in 2019. On July 30, 2017, he became the 31st player in MLB history to reach 3,000 hits and the first Dominican player to achieve that milestone. Beltré retired following the 2018 season with 3,166 career hits, 477 home runs, and 1,707 runs batted in. He hit for the cycle three times in his career (2008, 2012, 2015), making him one of six players to do so in MLB history.

Having played 21 major league seasons and won the Rawlings Gold Glove Award five times, Beltré is notable for his defensive prowess and career longevity as well as his power hitting. He played in four MLB All-Star Games and won the Silver Slugger Award four times. Upon his retirement, Beltré was the only third baseman in history with both 3,000 career hits and 400 home runs. According to Baseball Reference, Beltré is also the third baseman with the third-highest WAR all time. He retired as the all-time leader amongst third basemen in career hits and RBIs, and ranked third in home runs amongst third basemen. He is also the fifth major-leaguer to have hit at least 100 home runs for three different teams. In 2024, Beltré was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

==Early life==
Beltré was born on April 7, 1979, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. He attended Liceo Máximo Gómez High School. 

While working out at Campo Las Palmas in 1994, a Los Angeles Dodgers facility — one of the first of its kind for a Major League Baseball (MLB) team in the Dominican Republic — Beltré was spotted by scouts Ralph Avila and Pablo Peguero. Though only 15 years old and weighing , Beltré featured a quick swing and live throwing arm. On the insistence of Avila and Peguero, the Dodgers signed him in July 1994 with a $23,000 signing bonus.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Dodgers (1998–2004)===
Beltré was a highly touted prospect when he began his major league career. After being called up to the majors from the then-Dodgers&#x27; double-A affiliate San Antonio Missions, Beltré made his major league debut on June 24, 1998, starting at third base in the first game of an interleague series against the Anaheim Angels. At the time, he was the youngest player in the National League (NL). During his first at-bat, Beltré hit a two-out run batted in (RBI) double off Angels starter Chuck Finley into left field to score Paul Konerko from second base to tie the game. Beltré hit his first home run six days later against Texas Rangers starter Rick Helling. At the end of the 1998 season, Beltré finished with 13 errors at third base while batting .215 with seven home runs.

At one point in the spring training prior to the start of the 1999 season, Beltré&#x27;s agent, Scott Boras, commented to him that &quot;he couldn&#x27;t believe&quot; his relatively rapid ascent to the majors and handling of &quot;such a difficult position like third base&quot; at age 20. Beltré replied that he was 19 years old, not 20. Boras then realized that Beltré&#x27;s date of birth in the Dodgers&#x27; records was incorrect and indicated the same to the team, but, that if they were to correct the mistake by compensating Beltré for signing him at younger than MLB&#x27;s allowable age, they would no longer pursue the issue. Team personnel at Las Palmas denied Boras&#x27; assertion. As a result, Boras and Beltré went public. Boras convinced Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig to investigate the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball suspended their scouting operations in the Dominican Republic for one year, as well as Avila and Peguero. Dodgers general manager Fred Claire, whom MLB did not contact during their investigation, publicly expressed surprise and that he was unaware of the incident. Selig awarded Beltré $48,500 in damages.

In 2004, Beltré had a breakout season in which he established a number of career highs, including leading MLB with 48 home runs. Other career highs included batting .334, 200 hits, 121 RBI, 104 runs scored, .629 slugging percentage, and a then-career high 32 doubles. He finished second in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) and was honored with his first career Silver Slugger Award and the Babe Ruth Home Run Award.

===Seattle Mariners (2005–2009)===

The Seattle Mariners signed Beltré as a free agent before the 2005 season to a five-year, $64 million deal. Regressing to his pre-2004 form, he batted just .255 with 19 home runs and 87 RBI. Manager Mike Hargrove did not give up hope on Beltré, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a season that, personally, he&#x27;s disappointed in. I think it was a year that he will improve on the longer he&#x27;s here and the longer he&#x27;s in the American League.&quot;
After Beltré had batted .167 through April 10, Ted Miller of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; wrote that he might become one of the Mariners&#x27; greatest busts. By June 5, 2006, Beltré&#x27;s batting average was slowly improving, from .109 on April 16 to .236 at that time. After he had hit his first home run in April and his second later that month, Beltré&#x27;s hitting began to improve.

On July 23, 2006, against the Boston Red Sox, Beltré hit an inside-the-park home run, the first one ever in Safeco Field history.

Though it was not a great season for Beltré, it was statistically his best as a Mariner. He hit .276 and had 26 home runs, 99 RBI, and 41 doubles. He also was honored with a Fielding Bible Award for being the top MLB defensive third baseman during the year.

The 2007 season was not one of Beltré&#x27;s better defensive years statistically. He tied with Brandon Inge for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, with 18, but ranked second in the league in assists, total chances, and range factor. He was charged with the lowest fielding percentage of all third basemen in the league at .958. In spite of leading third basemen in errors, Beltré was selected for his first Rawlings Gold Glove Award, becoming the first Mariners third baseman to win the award.

On September 1, 2008, Beltré hit for the cycle, at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, becoming the fourth Mariner to do so. Arizona Diamondbacks shortstop Stephen Drew hit for the cycle that day as well, the first time two players had done so since 1920. He won his second Fielding Bible Award for his defense that year.

Beltré&#x27;s decision not to wear a cup despite playing third base has been well-documented. This came back to hurt him on August 12, 2009, when he took a hard ground ball to the groin. Although he stayed in for the remainder of the 14-inning victory, he was put on the DL after suffering bleeding in one of his testicles. In his first game after returning from the DL, teammate Ken Griffey Jr. conspired with those responsible for the Safeco Field public address system to have Beltré&#x27;s at-bat intro music be the opening march from &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;.
Beltré declared free agency on November 5, 2009.

===Boston Red Sox (2010)===
On January 7, 2010, Beltré signed a one-year, $9 million deal with the Boston Red Sox. The contract had a $5 million player option for 2011 with a $1 million buyout.

While Beltré&#x27;s career before coming to the Red Sox had been regarded as somewhat disappointing, he hit .321 with 28 homers and 49 doubles in 2010, benefiting from the hitter-friendly Fenway Park. Beltré led the Red Sox in batting average and tied David Ortiz for the team lead in RBIs (102). He finished the year with 189 hits in 589 at-bats and 84 runs scored. Beltré led the Majors in doubles with 49 (also a career-high). He also finished fourth in the AL in batting average, and was fifth in the AL in total bases (326) and slugging percentage (.553). He also had two stolen bases on the year, and finished ninth in the MVP voting.

===Texas Rangers (2011–2018)===
On January 5, 2011, Beltré signed a five-year (2011–15), $80 million contract with the Texas Rangers. He played with the Rangers for eight years until his retirement from baseball in 2018. Beltré&#x27;s statistics improved when he was in his thirties. While he had previously played in ballparks in Los Angeles and Seattle that are known for being unfavorable to hitters, the Rangers&#x27; ballpark was known as a hitter-friendly environment. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described Beltré&#x27;s Rangers tenure as &quot;nothing short of brilliant&quot;.

====2011====

Beltré was on the 2011 American League All-Star team. On July 22, Beltré strained his hamstring and was also placed on the DL. On September 4, he hit a line single to right against the Red Sox for his 2,000th career hit. On September 11, Beltré hit two home runs, including the 300th of his career, against the Oakland Athletics. He was named the AL Player of the Month for September.

In 2011, Beltré batted .296 with 32 home runs, fifth in the AL. He was third in the American League in slugging percentage (.561), sixth in RBIs (105), and ninth in OPS (.892). &quot;The Fielding Bible&quot; staff estimated that he saved 17 runs on defense in 2011.

On October 4, 2011, in Game 4 of the ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays, Beltré became the sixth player—the first in a Division Series—to hit three home runs in a Major League playoff game.

Beltré played in the 2011 World Series with the Rangers. He added a fourth playoff home run in Game 5 of the 2011 World Series when he went down to one knee chasing an outside curve ball from Chris Carpenter. The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games.

More recognition was bestowed on Beltré for his defense. On November 1, 2011, he was honored with his third Gold Glove Award and first by a Ranger third baseman since Buddy Bell&#x27;s six-year run from 1979 to 1984. He also won his third Fielding Bible Award. On November 2, 2011, he was awarded the Silver Slugger Award.

====2012====
Once again voted to the All-Star Game on July 1, 2012, Beltré was named a starter. He joined teammates Josh Hamilton and Mike Napoli on the All-Star team. It was Beltré&#x27;s third All-Star Game and third in a row dating back to 2010 with the Boston Red Sox.

In the August 22, 2012, game against the Baltimore Orioles, Beltré hit three home runs in his first three at-bats, including two in the same inning. He joined Pablo Sandoval, Albert Pujols, George Brett, Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth as the only players to hit a three-homer game in both the regular season and the postseason. On August 24, he hit for the cycle for the second time in his career. Both of his cycles came at Rangers Ballpark. With his first coming as a member of the Mariners, it was the first time in MLB history that a player had hit for the cycle more than once at the same stadium. He joined Joe DiMaggio as the only two players in big league history to have a three-homer game and a cycle in the same week. For his efforts, Beltré was named the AL Player of the Week for August 20–26. During the seven games he hit .433 (13-for-30) with three doubles, one triple, five home runs, nine RBI and seven runs scored. He had the highest slugging percentage (1.100) in the majors, the most total bases (33), was tied for first in hits and home runs, and tied for second in RBI.

After the season, more defensive accolades followed Beltré. He won his second consecutive Fielding Bible Award and fourth overall. He was also honored with the Gold Glove Award for the season on October 30, and second Platinum Glove Award. Wilson Sporting Goods honored him as one of their Defensive Players of the Year; in that year the award was established.

====2013====

The Rangers organization named Beltré the team captain in 2013.

On July 8, 2013, Beltré was named the American League Player of the Week for July 1–7. He batted .478 (11-for-23) with four home runs, two doubles and five RBI in six games. He led the American League in home runs, slugging (1.087), OPS (1.607), total bases (25), and extra-base hits (six) while producing the fourth-highest batting average. Beltré hit safely in all six games with two or more hits four times. He had the 24th multi-homer game of his career with a pair of home runs on July 4 against Seattle.

Maintaining his strong hitting throughout July, Beltré was named the American League Player of the Month, his fourth career monthly award. He batted .369 with four doubles, nine homers, 19 RBI and 13 runs scored over 26 games. He tied for the major league lead with both Alfonso Soriano, in home runs, and Torii Hunter, in total bases (69). Beltré also finished among the AL leaders in slugging percentage (second, .670), hits (tied for second, 38), extra-base hits (tied for fourth, 13), RBI (tied for fifth) and batting average (sixth). He capped off the month with a walk-off home run to lead the Rangers past the Angels on July 31, the seventh walk-off home run of his career, and first with Texas. It was his third monthly award with Texas, making him one of seven players to win multiple times with the Rangers, including Josh Hamilton (four), Rafael Palmeiro, Alex Rodriguez (both with three), Iván Rodríguez, Juan González and Rubén Sierra (two each).

For the 2013 season, Beltré played in 161 games and totaled a .315 average, 30 homers, 92 RBI and .509 SLG. He led the American League with 199 hits and was fourth in batting average and fifth in total bases (321). He also made the top-10 in games played, slugging percentage and home runs. In the AL MVP voting, he was tied for seventh place. The Dallas–Fort Worth chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America named Beltré the Texas Rangers Player of the Year.

====2014====
On May 7, 2014, while facing Jorge de la Rosa of the Colorado Rockies, Beltré hit his 100th home run as a member of the Rangers, becoming only the fifth player in Major League history to hit 100 home runs with three teams. He joined Darrell Evans, Reggie Jackson, Alex Rodriguez, and Jim Thome.

On June 24, 2014, Beltré singled off Drew Smyly of the Detroit Tigers for his 2,500th career hit, and the first hit of a 4-for-4 game.

On September 18, Beltré singled off Sonny Gray in the first inning for his 2,591st hit, surpassing Vladimir Guerrero as the all-time hit leader among Dominican-born players.

Beltré finished the 2014 season batting .324 – his highest average since 2004 – with 19 home runs and 77 RBI in 148 games.

====2015====
In February 2015, the Rangers picked up Beltré&#x27;s option, which would have become guaranteed if he had reached 586 plate appearances in the 2015 season.

While playing the Cleveland Indians on May 15, 2015, Beltré hit his 400th home run on a sinker from Bruce Chen. He became the 52nd player in MLB history to reach that plateau, and the fourth to do so while playing at least 75 percent of his games at third base.
Enduring a torn ligament in his left thumb over the last three months of the season, Beltré had surgery to repair it immediately after the season ended.

On August 3, 2015, Beltré hit for the cycle with hits in each of the first, second, third, and fifth innings against the Houston Astros at Globe Life Park in Arlington in a 12–9 win. It was his third career cycle, second as a Ranger, and third at Globe Life, the Rangers&#x27; home park, making him the only player ever to hit three cycles in one stadium. He became the first Rangers player to hit for multiple cycles. The first player in 82 years to hit for a third cycle, he became the fourth player to do so and tied the major league record for total career cycles, joining Long John Reilly, Bob Meusel and Babe Herman.

The Phi Delta Theta fraternity presented Beltré with the 2014 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award on September 17, 2015, making him the first Rangers player to win the award. He had contributed significantly to humanitarian acts in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex such as Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation, Texas Rangers RBI program, the I Love Baseball program, which operates in the Dominican Republic, the Baseball Tomorrow Fund, as well as the foundations established by a number of major league players.

During the last week of the season, and the Rangers&#x27; run towards the AL West championship, Beltré batted .448 with two home runs and 13 RBI. He also went 2-4 with a home in the final game of the season to help the Rangers advance to their sixth AL West title. He finished the season with 18 home runs, 83 RBI, 163 hits, and .287 average.

====2016====
On April 15, 2016, Beltré and the Rangers agreed to a two-year, $36 million contract extension that would cover the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Valued at $18 million each for both seasons, the extension prevented Beltré from becoming a free agent at the end of the season.

Displaying a drop to one knee, Beltré hit a home run on a curve ball from Jesse Hahn of Oakland on May 17. In a May 29 game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Beltré hit a two-run home run off Juan Nicasio to give him 1,501 career RBI, making him the 54th player to reach the milestone, and the fourth third baseman. On July 2, 2016, Beltré became the 28th player all time to amass 10,000 career at-bats. On July 23, 2016, he became the 36th player all time to record 11,000 career plate appearances. Two days later, he hit the walk-off home run, the ninth of his career, against the Athletics in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 7−6 win.

On August 24, 2016, Beltré, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, hit a go-ahead two-out double for his 2,900th career hit and led the Rangers to a 6–5 win. With this hit, Beltré became the 39th player in Major League history to reach the milestone.

Beltré would once again show his signature home run knee drop after hitting a solo shot in the second inning in a game against the Houston Astros on September 13, 2016. His 30th of the season, it was the first time he reached the mark since 2013 and fifth in his career. Ten days later, his two-run home run in the eighth inning against the Athletics aided the Rangers in clinching the American League West division crown for the second year in a row and the seventh in franchise history. He also reached 100 RBI for the first time since 2012, and the fifth time in his career. He was selected as the American League Gold Glove winner at third base, the fifth of his career.

====2017====

Beltré began the 2017 season on the 10-day disabled list; he had injured his right leg near the end of spring training.

On July 4, Beltré hit his 600th career double, becoming the 17th player all-time to reach that milestone. On July 7, Beltré became the 21st player to amass 5,000 career total bases. On July 26, Beltré was ejected by umpire Gerry Davis; in a game against the Miami Marlins, Davis asked Beltré, who was the next scheduled batter, to move closer to the on-deck circle. Beltré responded by picking up the edge of the logo that marked the on-deck circle and moving it closer to where he had been standing, which prompted Davis to eject him.

Beltré collected his 3,000th hit with a double into left field against Wade Miley of the Baltimore Orioles on July 30, 2017, making him the 31st player to reach this milestone and the first Dominican born player to accomplish it.

Beltré played in only 94 games in 2017 due to hamstring and calf problems.

====2018====
Prior to the start of the 2018 season, the Rangers signed Bartolo Colón, giving them the only two active players with at least 20 seasons in the major leagues. On April 5, 2018, Beltré doubled in the second inning versus the Oakland Athletics to pass Rod Carew as the all-time Latin-American hits leader.

On June 13, 2018, Beltré hit a double that gave him 3,090 career hits; this made him the all-time leader in hits by a player not born in the United States.

On November 20, 2018, Beltré announced his retirement.

===Career statistics===

In 2,933 games over 21 seasons, Beltré posted a .286 batting average with 3,166 hits, 477 home runs, 1,707 RBI, 121 stolen bases, 1,524 runs, 636 doubles, a .339 on-base percentage, a .480 slugging percentage, and a .960 fielding percentage. In 28 postseason games, he hit .261 (29-for-111) with five home runs and 11 RBI.

===Playing style and reputation===
Beltré is regarded as one of the greatest third basemen of all time. Having played 21 major league seasons and won five Gold Gloves, he was notable for his longevity and his fielding ability as well as his power hitting.

Beltré&#x27;s signature home run swing included a drop to one knee when connecting with a breaking ball, particularly notable during Game 5 of the 2011 World Series in an at bat against Cardinals ace pitcher Chris Carpenter.

Beltré&#x27;s defensive style was somewhat unorthodox. Rangers manager Ron Washington remarked that Beltré fielded ground balls incorrectly by stopping before catching the ball and relying very little on the positioning of his feet in throwing the ball to first base. Beltré explained that his arm was so strong that early in his career he was making many throwing errors; by planting his feet, he was able to improve his accuracy despite his lack of proper foot positioning.

Another major league manager, Joe Maddon, compared the unique style of Beltré&#x27;s defensive play to Ozzie Smith&#x27;s &quot;flair at shortstop&quot;, Stan Musial&#x27;s &quot;coiled batting stance&quot; and the way Steve Carlton wrapped his left wrist before releasing a slider. Commented Maddon further on Beltré&#x27;s defense, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of guys that did things unique to them that weren&#x27;t out of the &quot;Spalding Guide&quot;. They did things you wouldn&#x27;t teach, and if somebody else tried to do it, they would not be very good.&quot; Commented Rangers bench coach Steve Buechele, &quot;He&#x27;s not your most conventional third baseman, he does things his own way and has developed his own style over his career but there&#x27;s something to be said for his hand-eye coordination and his hands. It&#x27;s remarkable what he does. ... He&#x27;s a super smart player, knows where to position himself.&quot;

Beltré was known for the sense of playfulness and joy that he exhibited on the field. He had a routine with Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus on pop flies where both men put their arms up to catch the ball. During a game against the Red Sox on June 26, 2016, Sandy León hit a foul ball which landed in the first row in the stands, just out of Beltré&#x27;s reach. However, instead of returning immediately to the infield, he reached very close to the ball in a motion, pretending as if he were going to take it away from the fan who caught León&#x27;s foul ball.

Beltré was also known for his dislike of anyone touching the top of his head. Before the game where he recorded his 3,000th hit, he let his teammates touch his head. Much to his dismay, the act turned into a game, inducing repeat offenders such as his infield partner Andrus. Beltré also disliked Gatorade showers. After a game in which he hit a grand slam that provided the decisive runs in a 5–2 win over the Athletics on August 15, 2016, he took a broom from the groundskeepers closet and began combing an area of infield dirt. Still, Rougned Odor trotted to Beltré carrying a bucket filled with Gatorade, and in his attempt to drench Beltré, missed him with the launch of the column of the liquid.

<text>Dreamscape is a 1984 American sci-fi horror-adventure film directed by Joseph Ruben from a story by David Loughery, with Chuck Russell, Loughery, and Ruben co-writing. It stars Dennis Quaid, Kate Capshaw, Max von Sydow and Christopher Plummer.

==Plot==
Alex Gardner is a psychic who has been using his talents solely for personal gain, which mainly consists of gambling and womanizing. When he was 19 years old, Alex had been the prime subject of a scientific research project documenting his psychic ability but, in the midst of the study, he disappeared.

After running afoul of a local gangster and extortionist named Snead, Alex evades two of Snead&#x27;s thugs by allowing himself to be taken by two men: Finch and Babcock, who identify themselves as representing an academic institution. At the institution, Alex is reunited with his former mentor, Dr. Paul Novotny, who is now involved in government-funded psychic research. Novotny, aided by fellow scientist Dr. Jane DeVries, has developed a technique that allows psychics to voluntarily link with the minds of others by projecting themselves into the subconscious during REM sleep. Novotny equates the original idea for the dreamscape project to the practice of the Senoi natives of Malaysia, who believe the dream world is just as real as reality. The project was intended for clinical use to diagnose and treat sleep disorders, particularly nightmares; but it has been hijacked by Bob Blair, a powerful government agent. Novotny convinces Alex to join the program in order to investigate Blair&#x27;s intentions. Alex gains experience with the technique by helping a man who is worried about his wife&#x27;s infidelity and by treating a young boy named Buddy, who is plagued with nightmares so terrible that a previous psychic lost his sanity trying to help him. Buddy&#x27;s nightmare involves a large sinister &quot;snake-man&quot;.

Alex and Jane&#x27;s growing infatuation culminates with Alex sneaking into Jane&#x27;s dream to have sex with her, though she protests when she wakes up. He does this without technological aid, which no one else has been able to achieve. With the help of novelist Charlie Prince, who has been covertly investigating the project for a new book, Alex learns that Blair intends to use the dream-linking technique for assassination, as people who die in their dreams also die in the real world.

Blair murders Prince and Novotny to silence them. The President of the United States is admitted as a patient due to recurring nightmares. Blair assigns Tommy Ray Glatman, a mentally unstable psychic who murdered his own father, to enter the president&#x27;s nightmare and assassinate him. Blair considers the president&#x27;s nightmares about nuclear holocaust as a sign of political weakness, which he deems a liability in the upcoming negotiations for nuclear disarmament.

Following Alex&#x27;s escape from a car with Blair and his goons, Alex flees on a motorcycle and ends up at the racetrack where Snead&#x27;s thugs work. He makes a deal with them to call five winners at the racetrack, in exchange for their distracting Blair&#x27;s goons as he escapes back to the institution, with Jane letting him sneak in. He discovers Novotny&#x27;s dead body and forces one of Blair&#x27;s goons to tell him about the plan to kill the President. Alex projects himself into the president&#x27;s dream— a nightmare of a post nuclear war wasteland— to try to protect him. After a fight in which Tommy rips out a train conductor&#x27;s heart, Tommy attempts to incite a mutant-mob against the president, and battles Alex in the form of the snake-man from Buddy&#x27;s dream. Alex assumes the appearance of Tommy&#x27;s murdered father in order to distract him, allowing the President to impale him with a spear. The president is grateful to Alex but reluctant to confront Blair, who wields considerable political power. To protect himself and Jane, Alex enters Blair&#x27;s dream and kills him before Blair can retaliate.

Jane and Alex later board a train to Louisville, Kentucky, intent on making their previous dream encounter a reality. They are surprised to meet the ticket collector from Jane&#x27;s dream, but they decide to ignore it and keep on.

==Production==
According to author Roger Zelazny, the film developed from an initial outline that he wrote in 1981, based in part upon his novella &quot;He Who Shapes&quot; and 1966 novel &quot;The Dream Master&quot;. He was not involved in the project after 20th Century Fox bought his outline. Because he did not write the film treatment or the script, his name does not appear in the credits; assertions that he removed his name from the credits are unfounded. The music score is by French composer Maurice Jarre.

Principal photography began 3 February 1983 in Los Angeles. Locations included Los Angeles Union Station, Los Alamitos Race Course, and the University of the Pacific in Stockton.

==Release==
&quot;Dreamscape&quot; was released on August 15, 1984. The film was a box office success grossing 12.1 million dollars on a 6 million dollar budget. This was the second film released to movie theaters that was rated PG-13 under then-new MPAA ratings guidelines, following &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, which had come out five days prior. The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2000, January 4, 2005, and April 7, 2015.

==Reception==
&quot;Dreamscape&quot; has a 79% &#x27;Fresh&#x27; rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 critics, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Dreamscape&quot; mixes several genres—horror, sci-fi, action - and always maintains a sense of adventure and humor&quot;. On Metacritic - which assigns a weighted mean score - the film has a score of 63 out of 100 based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film was spoofed on RiffTrax by comedians Janet Varney and Cole Stratton on June 19, 2015.

<doc id="1290722" wikidata="Q1158341" url="?curid=1290722" title="Molina (surname)">
<text>Molina is a Spanish occupational surname. &quot;Molina&quot; is Latin for &#x27;mill&#x27; and is derived from another Latin word, &quot;mola&quot; (&#x27;millstone&#x27;). The surname originated from the early Middle Ages, referring to a person who operates a mill or a millstone. Other Spanish surnames, like Molinero (literally: &#x27;miller&#x27;), have also originated in the work and management of a mill. Spanish municipalities like Molina de Segura (Murcia) or Molina de Aragón (Castilla-La Mancha) still nowadays include millstones or mill blades in their respective coats of arms (cf. coat of arms of Molina de Segura and Coats of arms of Molina de Aragón).

A bloodline of Molinas, in the Christian Kingdom of Castile, originated from ennoblement when Manrique Pérez de Lara, of the House of Lara, in April 1154 issued a &quot;fuero&quot; to the town of Molina, nowadays called Molina de Aragón.

<text>Mae Hong Son (, ) is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in north-west Thailand, capital of Mae Hong Son Province. It is in the Shan Hills, near the border with Burma along the banks of the River Pai. As of 2018, the town had 7,066 inhabitants. The town covers the &quot;tambon&quot; Chong Kham of the Mueang Mae Hong Son district. Mae Hong Son is north of Bangkok and northwest of Chiang Mai.

==History==
The territory of Mae Hong Son Province was formerly part of Mawkmai State, one of the Shan States which had been founded in 1767 by Hsai Khiao, hailing from a noble family of Chiang Mai.

As a result of the Anglo-Siamese Boundary Commission of 1892-93 Mae Hong Son district was ceded to Siam, but the adjacent Möngmaü and Mehsakun trans-Salween districts— also claimed by Siam as territories located on the eastern side of the Salween River— were kept as part of British Burma.

==Climate==
Mae Hong Son has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are dry and warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm. Mae Hong Son holds the highest temperature ever recorded in Thailand when was observed on 28 April 2016.

=== Temperature ===

== Transportation ==
Mae Hong Son can be reached by car or bus from Chiang Mai by the . The town is also serviced by the Mae Hong Son Airport. It is also home to the only commercial Diesel power station in Thailand. The station has only a very small capacity of 4.40 MW (4,400 kW). It seems like it was placed here because of the remote location of the town.

== Tourism ==
The town has some tourist infrastructure, including many guesthouses and several internet cafes. It also has a vegetarian restaurant near the main market.

It is a popular jumping-off point for tours to visit hill tribe villages, caves, and waterfalls in the area. There are also some hot springs nearby.

&quot;Thung Dok Bua Tong&quot; in Amphoe Khun Yuam, where the fields of wild sunflowers bloom and cover the hills during the month of November, is best reached from Mae Hong Son and lies some 80 km away.

<doc id="1290732" wikidata="Q519880" url="?curid=1290732" title="Martingale (collar)">
<text>A martingale is a type of dog collar that provides more control over the animal without the choking effect of a slip collar.

Martingale dog collars are also known as greyhound, whippet or humane choke collars. The martingale dog collar was designed for sighthounds because their necks are larger than their heads and they can often slip out of buckle collars. These collars have gained popularity among owners of other breeds in the recent past with many trainers now recommending them instead of choke chains or buckle collars.

A martingale collar is made with two loops. The larger loop is slipped onto the dog&#x27;s neck and a lead is then clipped to the smaller loop. When the dog tries to pull, the tension on the lead pulls the small loop taut, which makes the large loop smaller and tighter on the neck, thus preventing escape. Properly fitted, the collar will be comfortably loose whenever the dog is not pulling against the leash.

The martingale collar is not recommended for use with a tie-out.

<text>USAS is software suite for mainframe computers, mainly intended for use in the airline, transportation, and hospitality industries. It is made up of a series of diverse and relatively complex applications written for the Unisys 1100-series, 2200-series, and Clearpath IX environments. 

All Nippon Airways became the first company to adopt the system in the late 1970s. Its name was originally an acronym for Univac Standard Airline Systems, but the product line is now referred to simply as &quot;USAS&quot;. With advancements in computing, USAS is slowly being replaced in the airline industry with other software, with Unisys also developing AirCore to replace its USAS offering.

==Applications in the suite==
USAS was mainly developed for use by airlines. Check-in, reservations, and cargo operations are therefore among its main components. The original USAS applications such as USAS*RES (Reservation System), USAS*CGO (Cargo Application) were written in the early 70s and have been adapted in different forms in varying degrees of customization.

Most (if not all) USAS applications are written as text-based online transaction systems which are designed for low overhead and fast response times. The environment most commonly used is HVTIP (Unisys&#x27; High-Volume Transaction Processing).

==Development==
Older USAS applications such as USAS*RES (Reservations System) or USAS*FDC (Flight Data Control) were written originally in Fortran, but elements of various applications were also written in COBOL, Unisys 1100/2200 assembly language (ASM or MASM), and the LINC 4GL. Lufthansa plays a major role in developing the USAS suite.

<doc id="1290734" wikidata="Q4855985" url="?curid=1290734" title="Bank Street Grounds">
<text>The Bank Street Grounds was a baseball park located in Cincinnati. The park was home to three major league baseball teams. The National League Cincinnati Stars club in 1880, the current Cincinnati Reds franchise from 1882 to 1883 and the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds of the Union Association in 1884. It succeeded the Avenue Grounds as the home site for professional ball in the Queen City.

== National League ==

A new National League entry, the Cincinnati Stars, formed for the 1880 season, but the new franchise was short-lived. The club was expelled from the league for selling beer and renting out its ballpark on Sundays, violating its self-instituted &quot;blue law&quot;, the club was disbanded.

== American Association ==

A new Reds franchise was formed as an American Association club in 1882. This club is the same Reds team that exists today. The AA had no such rules against Sunday play or beer sales. Indeed, the American Association was known informally as &quot;the beer and whiskey league&quot;.

According to Lee Allen, Cincinnati writer and eventual director of the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Worcester club had been especially instrumental in having the Reds expelled after 1880. In his 1948 book, &quot;The Cincinnati Reds&quot;, Allen took some satisfaction in pointing out that when the Reds re-formed in 1882, it was the same year that Worcester&#x27;s days as a major league franchise, as well as its influence, came to an end.

The Reds won the inaugural season of the AA, and as such participated in a World Series, of sorts, with the NL champions, the Chicago White Stockings. The exhibition Series was informally arranged, and ended after two games with each team having won one. Both games were staged at the Bank Street Grounds, or &quot;Bank-Street Grounds&quot; as the local papers stylized it.

== Union Association ==

In 1884, a former prominent member of the Reds front-office, a man named Justus Thorner, invested in the new Union Association club. He secured the Bank Street Grounds for his team, and the Reds had to look elsewhere. (Allen, p. 29-30). The Reds eventually settled on a site three blocks south, an asymmetrical lot bounded by McLean, York, Findlay and Western, opening the site that would eventually become Crosley Field, the home of the Reds until partway into the 1970 season.

During the 1884 season, the ballpark was dubbed Union Athletic Park in the local newspapers.

Although the Union Association was dominated by the St. Louis Maroons, the Cincinnati Unions or &quot;Outlaw Reds&quot; had a strong club that could hold its own against the Maroons, and drew well at the gate, eroding the &quot;real&quot; Reds&#x27; fan base. However, the &quot;Onion League&quot; folded after just one season.

== Back to the National League ==

The Reds moved from the American Association to the National League for the 1890 season. A year later, some legal issues arose over the sale of the club to a new owner, and the rights to Cincinnati Park (as the ancestor to Crosley Field was then known) were part of that litigation. To hedge their bets, the new owners turned their attention to the Bank Street Grounds property and secured a lease on the lot.(&quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, March 19, 1891, p.2) Once the legal issues were settled, the Reds opted to stay at Findlay and Western.

In the fall of 1893, the Reds had decided to build a new grandstand. (&quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, November 3, 1893, p.2) On December 5, the &quot;Enquirer&quot; reported that the Reds had designed a new &quot;League Park&quot; to be built on the old Bank Street site. The &quot;Enquirer&quot; for December 19 had an architect&#x27;s drawing of the new design, and reported that whether to build it at Findlay and Western or at Bank Street would be decided very soon. Ultimately the Reds again decided to stick with Findlay and Western, and Bank Street was done with professional baseball.

During the summers of 1886 through 1891, the property was used by the local chapter of the Order of Cincinnatus, who staged plays there.

== Location ==
The ballpark was located northwest of the intersection of Bank Street and McLean Avenue, just three blocks north on McLean from the future site of Crosley Field. Its location has typically been described as &quot;the foot of Bank Street.&quot; Contemporary maps which include a rough diagram of the ballpark clarify its location and orientation: Bank Street (south, third base); houses and McLean Avenue transitioning to Spring Grove Avenue (southeast, home plate); Duck Street (southwest, left and center fields); McDermott Street (northwest, center and right fields); houses and Western Avenue (northeast, first base). Once the park was abandoned, Dolph Street was run through the property to extend to Bank, paralleling Western.

Many of the streets in that part of the city have since been renamed, rerouted, or eliminated. The original location can be inferred from the remaining streets. In current terms, the site is northwest of the point where Bank Street turns from an east-west street to a north-south street (the former McLean Avenue). The ballpark site is now occupied by a parking lot for the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (&quot;SORTA&quot;) and CSX Transportation.

<doc id="1290744" wikidata="Q5302550" url="?curid=1290744" title="Dove Stone Reservoir">
<text>Dove Stone Reservoir lies at the convergence of the valleys of the Greenfield and Chew Brooks above the village of Greenfield, on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the reservoir is on the western edge of the Peak District National Park. It supplies drinking water to the surrounding area and is a tourist attraction, providing several walks amongst picturesque landscapes.

==History==
John Platt of Oldham built a Neo-Gothic mansion at Ashway Gap on the south side of the valley in 1850. It was used as a shooting lodge but after his brother James&#x27;s death in a shooting accident on the moor above it, the house was left empty. The house was later acquired by the Ashton-under-Lyne, Stalybridge and Dukinfield Waterworks Joint Committee. Boundary stones demarcating the extent of the estate are located at intervals along the footpaths along the south side of the reservoir. During World War I the waterworks board offered the house for use as a hospital. It was demolished in 1981.
On the northern end of Dove Stone Moss, above the Ashway Gap, the Ashway Stone is a memorial to James Platt, MP for Oldham, who was killed by an accidental discharge of the gun of Josiah Radcliffe, the Mayor of Oldham.

The reservoir scheme in the Greenfield Valley and Chew Valley by the Ashton-Under-Lyne, Stalybridge and Dukinfield Waterworks Joint Committee commenced in 1870. The scheme was completed with Dove Stone Reservoir in 1968 to collect water from the surrounding moorland. The main contractor was A.E. Farr (Civil Engineers) of Westbury, Wiltshire. Its construction was opposed by local mill owners, who claimed that damming the river would cut off their water supply. As a result, a tunnel was built higher up in the hillside to bypass the reservoir.

During a visit in 1981 to attend the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, King Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV of Tonga visited Dove Stone Reservoir. To commemorate the visit, a carved stone has been set into the dam wall of the Yeoman Hey Reservoir.

In December 2015, a man who travelled from London to Manchester and walked to a location close to the reservoir, died on the Chew Track. The unknown individual was initially nicknamed &quot;Neil Dovestones&quot; by pathologists, until he was identified as David Lytton in January 2017.

==Geography==

The reservoir lies at the convergence of the valleys of the Greenfield and Chew Brooks above Greenfield in the north west edge of the Peak District&#x27;s Dark Peak area. It is the lowest and largest of three reservoirs in the Greenfield Valley. Above it are the Yeoman Hey, built in 1880, and Greenfield Reservoirs. Chew Reservoir is in the upper Chew Valley and at above sea level was the highest reservoir in the British Isles when it was built in 1914. The reservoirs are surrounded by moorland and, above the valley, high rocky outcrops.

The A635 road to Holmfirth passes to the west and north of the reservoirs.

==Dam==


The Ashton under Lyne, Stalybridge &amp; Dukinfield Joint Committee obtained an Act of Parliament in 1958 enabling it to build the reservoir. The committee engaged G.H. Hill &amp; Sons as engineers and the contractor was A. E. Farr &amp; Company. J.B. Blayney was employed as landscape architect as required by the Act. Work started in 1960 and was finished in October 1966.

The dam&#x27;s earth embankment is 38 metres high and 550 metres in length. It is 4.25 metres wide at the crest and is 183 metres at the widest point at its base. A concrete cutoff in a 23 metre deep trench makes a seal between the foundations and the earthworks preventing leaks. Above the concrete cutoff is the clay core. Dove Stone is possibly the last large dam to be built in Britain with a conventional puddle clay core. The volume of the dam is 34,000 cubic metres.

The dam wall does not have a traditional spillway to control water height but discharges into a tunnel under the side of the valley, via a large bell-mouth drop-shaft overflow in one corner, a feature not normally seen on Pennine dams ⁬which usually have masonry spillways.

On the dam wall near the drop shaft is an ingeniously designed emergency overflow consisting of three metal troughs that when full tip water over a wall where it runs across the road and back into the river below. The emergency overflow is activated if a flash flood of approximately two metres of water occurs.

==Recreation==
Access to the reservoir is via the A635 road to the pay and display car parks. There are toilets at Binn Green and at the main car park. The Peak District Park Ranger Service maintains an office next to the main car park and rangers patrol the reservoirs and park at weekends.

The reservoirs and surrounding moorland attract walkers and hikers. Joggers compete in a race every Friday evening in the summer months. The path around Dove Stone is well maintained, gravelled and relatively flat. Leading off its circular path are paths to Chew Reservoir, towards the car park at Binn Green and along the Greenfield Valley past the Yeoman Hey and Greenfield Reservoirs. Dovestone Sailing Club uses the reservoir. The Chew Valley is a gritstone climbing area visited by climbers and boulderers

Started in 1999, the &quot;Life for a Life&quot; plantation allows people to pay to have a tree planted in the name of a loved one. More than 700 trees have been planted.

In 2010, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds established an interest in the area, and decided to manage the surrounding moorland and woodland, in association with United Utilities.

The Peak District Boundary Walk runs along the path on the dam&#x27;s embankment.

<text>Strinesdale is a reservoir situated on the A62 between Oldham and Delph in Greater Manchester, England. The town of Rochdale is to the north and the town of Oldham to the south. It is fed by the River Medlock.

Strinesdale is an area of water and woodland covering approximately 40 acres (162,000 m2). In 1991, the reservoirs were drained and replaced by two smaller lakes with the old reservoir sites being planted with trees and grassland. Herons and kestrels can be seen on the lakeside and as the woodland develops it will provide shelter for animals and birds and many varieties of wild flowers. The site is now used for walking, orienteering and fishing. 

The original upper reservoir was built in around 1826 and the erected plaque can be seen at Upper Strinesdale; a second reservoir followed in 1838.

Strinesdale derives its name from the Old English &quot;strine&quot; meaning boundary in connotation to the old Lancashire–Yorkshire boundary that ran through the middle of the site; since 1974 the whole area lies in Greater Manchester.

Strinesdale was home to a children&#x27;s boarding hospital in the 1950s–1960s.

<text> was the lead ship of the of heavy cruisers which served with Nazi Germany&#x27;s during World War II. The ship was laid down at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1935 and launched in February 1937; entered service shortly before the outbreak of war, in April 1939. The ship was named after Admiral Franz von Hipper, commander of the German battlecruiser squadron during the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and later commander-in-chief of the German High Seas Fleet. She was armed with a main battery of eight guns and, although nominally under the limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, actually displaced over .

 saw a significant amount of action during the war, notably in the Battle of the Atlantic. She also led the assault on Trondheim during Operation Weserübung; while en route to her objective, she sank the British destroyer . In December 1940, she broke out into the Atlantic Ocean to operate against Allied merchant shipping. This operation ended without significant success, but in February 1941, sortied again, sinking several merchant vessels before eventually returning to Germany via the Denmark Strait. The ship was then transferred to northern Norway to participate in operations against convoys to the Soviet Union, culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, in which she sank the destroyer and the minesweeper , but was in turn damaged and forced to withdraw by the light cruisers and .

Disappointed by the failure to sink merchant ships in that battle, Adolf Hitler ordered the majority of the surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to persuade Hitler to retain the surface fleet. As a result, was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs. The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel, Germany. Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952; her bell is currently on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel.

The of heavy cruisers was ordered in the context of German naval rearmament after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 and repudiated the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1935, Germany signed the Anglo–German Naval Agreement with Great Britain, which provided a legal basis for German naval rearmament; the treaty specified that Germany would be able to build five &quot;treaty cruisers&quot;. The s were nominally within the 10,000-ton limit, though they significantly exceeded the figure.

 was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . After the installation of a clipper bow during fitting out, her overall length increased to . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of . was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired boilers. The ship&#x27;s top speed was , at . Her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men.

″s primary armament was eight SK L/60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets, placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft. Her anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve L/65 guns, twelve guns, and eight guns. She had four triple torpedo launchers, all on the main deck next to the four range finders for the anti-aircraft guns.

″s armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 70 mm thick sides. The heaviest armor with thickness was applied to the vertical surfaces of the conning tower, while the horizontal surfaces were limited to .

The initial design of included an aircraft hangar for one aircraft. During building, the requirements were changed and an aircraft hangar was constructed for two floatplanes that could be stored side by side. The wider aircraft hangar forced the rearrangement of the middle pair of 10.5 cm guns from the superstructure deck to the upper deck, which restricted their arc of fire towards the rear. The ship was equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. In 1941 the aircraft hangar was reduced with place for just one Arado and in total only two Arado floatplanes were carried.

== Service history ==
 was ordered by the from the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg. Her keel was laid on 6 July 1935, under construction number 501. The ship was launched on 6 February 1937, and was completed on 29 April 1939, the day she was commissioned into the German fleet. The Commander-in-Chief of the , (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder, who had been Franz von Hipper&#x27;s chief of staff during World War I, gave the christening speech and his wife Erika Raeder performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow. A raked funnel cap was also installed.

 (Captain at Sea) Hellmuth Heye was given command of the ship at her commissioning. After her commissioning in April 1939, steamed into the Baltic Sea to conduct training maneuvers. The ship also made port calls to various Baltic ports, including cities in Estonia and Sweden. In August, the ship conducted live fire drills in the Baltic. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the ship was still conducting gunnery trials. She was briefly used to patrol the Baltic, but she did not see combat, and was quickly returned to training exercises. In November 1939, the ship returned to the Blohm &amp; Voss dockyard for modifications; these included the replacement of the straight stem with a clipper bow and the installation of the funnel cap.

Sea trials in the Baltic resumed in January 1940, but severe ice restrained the ship to port. On 17 February, the Kriegsmarine pronounced the ship fully operational, and on the following day, began her first major wartime patrol during Operation Nordmark. She joined the battleships and and the destroyers and in a sortie into the North Sea off Bergen, Norway. A third destroyer, , was forced to turn back after sustaining damage from ice. The ships operated under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Marschall. The ships attempted to locate British merchant shipping, but failed and returned to port on 20 February.

=== Operation Weserübung ===

Following her return from the North Sea sortie, was assigned to the forces tasked with the invasion of Norway, codenamed Operation Weserübung. The ship was assigned as the flagship of Group 2, along with the destroyers , , , and . &quot;KzS&quot; Heye was given command of Group 2 during the operation. The five ships carried a total of 1,700 Wehrmacht mountain troops, whose objective was the port of Trondheim; the ships loaded the troops in Cuxhaven. The ships steamed to the Schillig roadstead outside Wilhelmshaven, where they joined Group 1, consisting of ten destroyers, and the battleships and under the command of Vice Admiral Günther Lütjens, which were assigned to cover Groups 1 and 2. The ships steamed out of the roadstead at midnight on the night of 6–7 April 1940.

Between 14:25 and 14:48 on 7 April, the ships were unsuccessfully attacked West of the Skagerrak by twelve bombers. By evening the weather had deteriorated and several of the destroyers were unable to maintain the high ( 27 knots ) speed and remained behind the main force. On 8 April at 09:15 one of the trailing destroyers, the , signaled that it had engaged a British destroyer, and at 09:22 Lütjens ordered the to investigate. Upon arriving on the scene, was initially misidentified by the British destroyer as a friendly vessel, which allowed the German ship to close the distance and fire first. rained fire on &quot;Glowworm&quot;, scoring several hits. &quot;Glowworm&quot; attempted to flee, but when it became apparent she could not break away from the pursuing cruiser, she turned toward and fired a spread of torpedoes, all of which missed. The British destroyer scored one hit on ″s starboard bow before a rudder malfunction set the ship on a collision course with the German cruiser. The collision with &quot;Glowworm&quot; tore off a section of ″s armored belt on the starboard side, as well as the ship&#x27;s starboard torpedo launcher. Minor flooding caused a four degree list to starboard, though the ship was able to continue with the mission. &quot;Glowworm&quot;″s boilers exploded shortly after the collision, causing her to sink quickly. Forty survivors were picked up by the German ship. At 11:14 broke off the rescue operation and set course toward Trondheim with her four destroyers, whilst Group 1 set course for Narvik. and took a position South of the Lofoten in the Vestfjorden to cover both landings. The British destroyer had survived long enough to send a wireless message to Royal Navy headquarters, which allowed the battlecruiser time to move into position to engage and , though the German battleships used their superior speed to break off contact.

Group 2 was sighted at 14:50 by a Short Sunderland, and signal intelligence indicated enemy ships were operating nearby. In order to clarify the situation, at 17:50 launched an Arado seaplane in the direction of Trondheim. The Arado reported no activity in the approaches to Trondheim and then made an emergency landing in Eide, since the weather was too bad to land at in open sea. After trying to purchase fuel from locals, the aircrew were detained and handed over to the police. The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service captured the Arado, which was painted in Norwegian colors and used by the Norwegians until 18 April when it was evacuated to Britain.

When steaming at maximum speed through the long and narrow Trondheim Fjord towards Trondheim, successfully passed herself off as a British warship long enough to get past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. After the ships forced the most narrow part of the fjord between 04:04 and 04:14, one Norwegian battery belatedly opened fire but to no effect. responded with two salvoes from the rear turrets. The two remaining Arado seaplanes were flown off to scout and check for suitable places for airplane and seaplane bases. One of the airplanes also attacked a coastal battery with bombs. The cruiser entered the harbor and anchored at 05:25 to debark the mountain troops. A German tanker which was scheduled to refuel Group 2 at Trondheim failed to show up, and the ships had to remain in harbor because of fuel shortage. On 10 April an Arado seaplane from brought orders from Lütjens to attempt a breakout and return to Germany together with the two battleships on the following night. left Trondheim at 21:30, escorted by . The two ships first steamed Northwest to clear the Norwegian coast. On 11 April, at 02:50, returned to Trondheim due to bad weather and lack of fuel. This same bad weather allowed to take a short, direct route to Germany. The ship joined and at 08:00 on 12 April, and they reached Wilhelmshaven at 22:00, with only 125 out of 3005 cubic meters of fuel remaining. went into drydock where it was discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with &quot;Glowworm&quot; than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed in the span of two weeks.

=== Operation Juno ===
Marschall organized a mission to seize Harstad in Northern Norway in early June 1940; , the battleships and , and the four destroyers , , and were tasked with the operation. The ships departed from Kiel on 4 June. Three days later, and the four destroyers refueled from the supply ship . The plan was to attack the British base at Harstadt in the morning of 9 June, but shortly after midnight of 8 June the plan was changed: a reconnaissance plane reported no ships in Harstadt and since the German ships also detected highly increased convoy radio transmissions, Marschall deduced that the British were evacuating Harstadt. Instead of raiding Harstadt, Marschall decided to operate against the evacuation convoy. While in search of the convoy, the German force first encountered the tanker &quot;Oil Pioneer&quot; at 06:45 on 8 June, which was escorted by the trawler HMT &quot;Juniper&quot;. sank &quot;Juniper&quot; with gunfire and sank &quot;Oil Pioneer&quot;. At 10:52, encountered and sank the empty troopship &quot;Orama.&quot; Despite launching their Ar 196 reconnaissance planes, the German ships failed to find the convoy, and at 13:00, and the four destroyers returned to Trondheim to cover and protect the German forces there, whilst the battleships refueled from and continued the operation. Towards the evening and found a British force consisting of the British aircraft carrier and two escorting destroyers, and . All three British ships were sunk but was heavily damaged by a torpedo hit and both German battleships returned to Trondheim on 9 June as well.

On 10 June, and left Trondheim with the four destroyers in a second attempt to attack evacuating convoys but they returned to Trondheim the next day, having failed to locate any British vessels. On 13 June, fifteen Blackburn Skuas from 800 Naval Air Squadron and 803 Naval Air Squadron took off from the British aircraft carrier to attack the German ships at Trondheim. The bombers hit with a dud bomb and lost eight of their number to fighters and anti-aircraft guns. The anti-aircraft gunners of shot down one of the attacking British bombers. In order to cover the return of the damaged to Germany, and left Trondheim on 20 June for a raid towards the Iceland-Faeroes passage, but was torpedoed and damaged by the submarine and both ships returned to Trondheim the same day

On 25 July, steamed out on a commerce raiding patrol in the area between Spitzbergen and Tromsø; the cruise lasted until 9 August. The Arado seaplanes could find a few ships, but these were all neutrals. No British ships were found. On 31 July one of the Arados was lost in an accident. The next day, encountered the Finnish freighter &quot;Ester Thorden&quot;, which was found to be carrying of gold. The ship was seized and sent to occupied Norway with a prize crew. On 5 August received orders to return immediately to Germany. The cruiser first replenished from before heading for the Norwegian coast. On 10 August arrived in Wilhelmshaven.

=== Operation Nordseetour ===
The overhaul in Wilhelmshaven was completed on 9 September and with a new commanding officer, Wilhelm Meisel, the cruiser made ready to participate in Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of the United Kingdom. ″s role would have been a diversionary foray into the North Sea, Operation Herbstreise or &quot;Autumn Journey&quot;, with the aim of luring the British Home Fleet away from the intended invasion routes in the English Channel. Following the postponement of that operation, on 24 September the ship left Wilhelmshaven on a mission to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship&#x27;s propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, she returned to Hamburg&#x27;s Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.

The ship made a second attempt to break out into the Atlantic, designated Operation Nordseetour. On 30 November , escorted by five torpedo boats, left Germany for Bergen in Norway, where she refueled from the tanker on 1 December. The German cruiser then proceeded towards a position South of Jan Mayen, where she refueled several times from the tanker whilst waiting for convenient bad weather to break through the Denmark Strait into the North Atlantic. During a gale on the night of 6 December, she navigated the Denmark Strait undetected. After a refueling by the tanker &quot;Friedrich Breme&quot; on 12 December, Meisel started searching for the convoy HX 94, which according to intelligence was nearby. encountered a few independent sailing vessels but as his orders were to attack only convoys, Meisel did not attack and remained undetected. In deteriorating weather, the convoy was not found. Between refueling twice from the on 16 and 20 December, searched for the convoys SC 15 and HX 95 but again nothing was found because of bad weather. Finally Meisel decided to leave the North Atlantic convoy lanes and operate on the shipping lanes between the United Kingdom and West Africa, where the B-Dienst had reported the convoys SL 58 and SLS 58. An Arado floatplane was launched to search for the convoys, but the plane went missing and nothing was found. On 23 December the operated between the Azores and Spain.

At dusk on 24 December, , using her DeTe radar, detected Convoy WS 5A some west of Cape Finisterre. She shadowed the convoy during the night with her radar with the intention of attacking at dawn. During the night a large escort was visually detected and unsuccessfully attacked with three torpedoes. Convoy WS 5A was not a regular merchant convoy, but rather a heavily guarded troopship convoy consisting of twenty ships. Five of the twenty ships were allocated to Operation Excess. The convoy was protected by a powerful escort composed of the heavy cruiser and the light cruisers and . The aircraft carriers and were part of the convoy, but not operational as they were transferring crated aircraft. When attacked in the morning, she was surprised to make contact with &quot;Berwick&quot;. A torpedo attack on &quot;Berwick&quot; failed, but with her main guns she badly damaged the transport &quot;Empire Trooper&quot;, and lightly damaged the freighter &quot;Arabistan&quot;, before spotting other ships steaming toward her. Believing these ships to be destroyers preparing for a torpedo attack, she quickly withdrew, using her main guns to keep the escorts at bay. Ten minutes later, &quot;Berwick&quot; reappeared off ″s port bow; the German cruiser fired several salvos from her rear turrets and scored hits on the British cruiser&#x27;s rear turrets, waterline, and forward superstructure. then disengaged, to prevent the &#x27;British destroyers&#x27; from closing to launch a torpedo attack.

By this time &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; was running low on fuel, and so she put into Brest in occupied France on 27 December, escorted by the torpedo boat . While en route, encountered and sank the independent sailing 6,078 GRT passenger ship on 25 December. Another round of routine maintenance work was effected while the ship was in Brest, readying her for another sortie into the Atlantic shipping lanes. On 4 January was detected by British air reconnaissance in Brest. The same night a major air raid was mounted with 53 Vickers Wellington, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and Handley Page Hampden bombers, but due to cloud cover and heavy Flak these were unsuccessful. On the night of 10 January there was a smaller attack with twelve Whitleys, followed two nights later by an attack with 26 Wellingtons and Hampdens, but none of these caused any serious damage. The British failed to detect the departure of from Brest on 1 February and continued the attacks. On 4 February a Wellington wrongly claimed a hit on a cruiser in Brest.
=== Second Atlantic operation ===
The had initially sought to send the battleships and to operate in concert with , but suffered storm damage in December that prevented the participation of the two ships. Repairs were effected quickly, however, and the two battleships embarked upon a second attempt at the end of January. On 1 February 1941, embarked on her second Atlantic sortie, with orders to operate on the convoy lanes between the United Kingdom and West-Africa. The ship was allowed to operate against both lightly escorted convoys and independent sailing vessels, with the hope that her appearance in these waters would draw away British forces guarding the Denmark Strait, thus making it easier for and to break out into the Atlantic. Between 4 and 10 February patrolled off the Azores but no ships were found. She was refueled several times by the tanker . Upon learning that the British Force H had sortied from Gibraltar deep into the Mediterranean to bombard La Spezia, Meisel understood that the convoys between the UK, Gibraltar and West Africa were left uncovered with heavy units and he decided to operate closer to Gibraltar, where U-boat and Luftwaffe units had attacked convoy HG 53. On 11 February, encountered and sank the straggling 1,236 GRT English ship &quot;Iceland.&quot;

That evening around midnight, &quot;Admiral Hipper&#x27;s&quot; radar picked up the unescorted convoy SLS 64, which contained nineteen merchant ships. The following morning, posing as a British cruiser, she approached the convoy to close distance before opening fire at 06:19. The surprised ships dispersed at once. At the start of the fight Meisel remained three to five km distant from the ships, but once ammunition began running low he gave the order to close in, in order to fire more accurately. After ships were hit with cannon fire and stopped, they were finished off with torpedoes. fired all of her twelve torpedoes and claimed all torpedoes had hit. At 07:18 only six ships were still in sight, of which only two were steaming. Meisel decided to break off the fight and depart before British forces closed in. The British reported only seven ships lost, totaling 32,806 GRT along with damage to two more. The Germans claimed had sunk thirteen of the nineteen freighters totalling 79,000 GRT, while some survivors reported fourteen ships of the convoy had been sunk.Following the attack on convoy SLS 64, ″s fuel stocks were running low. Meisel feared that approaching British forces would cut him off from tankers waiting in the Azores and therefore returned to Brest on 15 February. Since the bigger dry docks had to be kept free for the eventual return of and , was docked in a smaller one, and while moving into it, damaged her starboard screw on uncharted wreckage. A spare screw had to be transported from Kiel, causing additional delay. Meanwhile, British bombers were regularly attacking the port, and the therefore decided that should return to Germany, where she could be better protected. On 15 March, the ship slipped out of Brest, unobserved, and steered to a rendezvous point South of Greenland with the tanker . The refueling was delayed to 21 March because of bad weather. Since the heavy cruiser was also returning from a raid to Germany around the same time, there was concern that the two ships might hinder each other, so was given orders to make the breakthrough via the Denmark Strait before 28 March. She managed to do so on 24 March. and two days later stopped to refuel in Bergen. By 28 March, the cruiser was docked in Kiel, having made the entire journey without being detected by the British.

Upon arrival, the ship went into the shipyard for an extensive overhaul, which lasted seven months. Raeder intended to continue to send the on North Atlantic raids, and as her operations so far had been dominated by the constant need to refuel, it was decided to increase her fuel capacity from 3050 to 3700 cubic meters. The aircraft hangar was also adapted at this time; the large hangar for two floatplanes with folding wings had proven difficult to handle in operations, and was replaced by a smaller hangar for just one floatplane, the spare room being taken up by refueling gear and extra food storage. After completion of the refit, conducted sea trials in the Baltic before putting into Gotenhafen on 21 December for some minor work. In January 1942, the ship had her steam turbines overhauled at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard; a degaussing coil was fitted to the ship&#x27;s hull during this overhaul. By March, the ship was again fully operational. By then, however, the strategic situation had altered completely: due to British air reconnaissance and developments in radar it was no longer viable to execute raids in the North Atlantic. Instead the German surface fleet concentrated in Norway as a deterrent against an Allied invasion and to attack Arctic convoys to Russia.

=== Deployment to Norway ===

On 19 March 1942, steamed to Trondheim, escorted by the destroyers , , and and the torpedo boats , , and . Several British submarines were patrolling the area, but failed to intercept the German flotilla. and her escorts reached their destination on 21 March. There, they joined the heavy cruisers and , though the latter had been torpedoed by the British submarine on 23 February and returned to Germany for repairs on 16 May. At the same time the heavy cruiser transferred from Germany to Norway. In begin March, the battleship had been operating against the Arctic convoy PQ 12 during Operation Sportpalast and had depleted the already very low German fuel stocks. As a result, operations above destroyer level were impossible and the remained in port for the next months.

In July fuel stocks were sufficient to allow operations again and the Germans intended to attack the next convoy PQ 17 with the complete surface fleet in Operation Rösselsprung. On 1 July the convoy was located by the B-Dienst and detected by U-boats. The next day, the first stage of Operation Rösselsprung was set in motion when German forces concentrated in Altafjord from where they could sortie against the convoy. On 2 July, , , the destroyers , , and , and the torpedo boats and &quot;T15&quot; left Trondheim for Altafjord, followed on 3 July by the cruisers and and the destroyers &quot;Z24&quot;, , , , &quot;Z30&quot; and coming from Narvik in order to avoid British reconnaissance, the German fleet did not steer into open waters but remained close to the coast. In fog ran aground in the narrow Tjeldsundet, and the destroyers , and struck uncharted rocks at Grimsöy in Vestfjorden and all these ships fell out for the operation. The destroyers and arrived also on 3 July in Altafjord.

Escorting the convoy were the battleships and and the aircraft carrier . Since aircraft from the &quot;Victorious&quot; had nearly torpedoed during Operation Sportpalast, Hitler explicitly forbade to launch the next stage of operation Rösselsprung, the actual attack on the convoy, as long as the aircraft carrier was not disabled by the Luftwaffe. Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty, which ordered the convoy to disperse in the evening of 4 July. In the morning of 5 July the Germans became aware that the escorts were withdrawing and the merchants were continuing independently. The second stage of Operation Rösselsprung was initiated at 11:37 and left Altafjord together with the German fleet. During the evening it became clear that they had been detected and reported by the British submarine and a Consolidated PBY Catalina from No. 201 Squadron RAF, although an attack by the Soviet submarine K-21 went unnoticed. The Germans aborted the operation and left the merchants over to the U-boats and the Luftwaffe, which sank 21 of the 34 fleeing transports.

Due to commitments in the Mediterranean with Operation Pedestal, the Royal Navy was not able to provide sufficient escorts for the next Arctic convoy and the sailing of convoy PQ-18 was delayed until September. The convoy was located on 8 September and on 10 September the Germans set Operation Doppelschlag in motion: all available surface units were ordered to the Altafjord from where they would launch their attack against the convoy. left Narvik together with the , the light cruiser and the destroyers and &quot;Z27&quot;, and arrived on 11 September in the Altafjord. and were under repair and remained in Narvik. On their way, the ships were first detected by the British submarine . and then unsuccessfully attacked by the British submarine . The Norwegian submarine and the British submarine sighted the German fleet but were unable to attack. The destroyers , , &quot;Z29&quot; and &quot;Z30&quot; also arrived in Altafjord on 11 September, but then the operation was once more cancelled because Hitler did not want to risk losses to the surface fleet.

In Operation Zarin, the cruiser laid a minefield on 24–28 September off the north-west coast of Novaya Zemlya, escorted by the destroyers &quot;Z23&quot;, &quot;Z28&quot;, &quot;Z29&quot;, and &quot;Z30&quot; The goal of the operation was to funnel merchant traffic further south, closer to the reach of German naval units in Norway. After her return to port, was transferred to Bogen Bay near Narvik for repairs to her propulsion system.

On 28–29 October, and the destroyers and were transferred further north from Narvik to the Altafjord. Because the Allies could not provide sufficient escorts for the next Arctic convoy PQ-19, they decided to cancel the convoy and instead on 29 October thirteen freighters sailed independently from Iceland to the USSR. From the USSR 23 empty ships also tried to return independently to Iceland. Against this traffic the Germans started Operation Hoffnung on 5 November: and the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, composed of &quot;Z27&quot;, &quot;Z30&quot;, , and , patrolled for Allied shipping in the Arctic. Oskar Kummetz commanded the squadron from . On 7 November, the cruiser&#x27;s Arado floatplane located the 7,925 GRT Soviet tanker and its escort, the auxiliary warship &quot;BO-78&quot;. Kummetz dispatched the destroyer &quot;Z27&quot; to sink the two Soviet ships. On 9 November the ships are back in the Kaafjord.

==== Battle of the Barents Sea ====
In December 1942, convoy traffic to the Soviet Union resumed. Raeder ordered a plan, Operation Regenbogen, to use the available surface units in Norway to launch an attack on the convoys. The first convoy of the month, JW 51A, passed to the Soviet Union without incident. However, the second, convoy JW 51B, was spotted by the submarine south of Bear Island. Raeder ordered the forces assigned to Operation Regenbogen into action. , again served as Kummetz&#x27;s flagship; the squadron comprised and the destroyers , , , &quot;Z29&quot;, &quot;Z30&quot;, and . The force left Altafjord at 18:00 on 30 December, under orders to avoid confrontation with even an equal opponent.

Kummetz&#x27;s plan was to divide his force in half; he would take and three destroyers north of the convoy to attack it and draw away the escorts. and the remaining three destroyers would then attack the undefended convoy from the south. At 09:15 on the 31st, the British destroyer spotted the three destroyers screening for ; the Germans opened fire first. Four of the other five destroyers escorting the convoy rushed to join the fight, while laid a smoke screen to cover the convoy. fired several salvos at &quot;Achates&quot;, raining shell splinters on the destroyer that severed steam lines and reduced her speed to . Kummetz then turned back north to draw the destroyers away. Captain Robert Sherbrooke, the British escort commander, left two destroyers to cover the convoy while he took the remaining four to pursue .

Rear Admiral Robert Burnett&#x27;s Force R, centered on the cruisers and , standing by in distant support of the Allied convoy, raced to the scene. The cruisers engaged , which had been firing to port at the destroyer . Burnett&#x27;s ships approached from ″s starboard side and achieved complete surprise. In the initial series of salvos from the British cruisers, was hit three times. One of the hits damaged the ship&#x27;s propulsion system; the No. 3 boiler filled with a mix of oil and water, which forced the crew to turn off the starboard turbine engine. This reduced her speed to . The other two hits started a fire in her aircraft hangar. She fired a single salvo at the cruisers before turning toward them, her escorting destroyers screening her with smoke. After emerging from the smoke screen, was again engaged by Burnett&#x27;s cruisers. Owing to the uncertainty over the condition of his flagship and the ferocity of the British defense, Kummetz issued the following order at 10:37: &quot;Break off action and retire to the west.&quot; Mistakenly identifying &quot;Sheffield&quot; as , the destroyer approached too closely and was sunk. Meanwhile, closed to within of the convoy, but due to poor visibility, she held her fire. She then received Kummetz&#x27;s order, and turned west to rendezvous with . inadvertently came alongside &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Jamaica&quot;, and after identifying them as hostile, engaged them. The British cruisers turned toward and came under fire from both German cruisers. ″s firing was more accurate and quickly straddled &quot;Sheffield&quot;, though the British cruiser escaped unscathed. Burnett quickly decided to withdraw in the face of superior German firepower; his ships were armed with guns, while and carried and guns, respectively.

Based on the order issued at the outset of the operation to avoid action with a force equal in strength to his own, poor visibility, and the damage to his flagship, Kummetz decided to abort the attack. In the course of the battle, the British destroyer &quot;Achates&quot; was sunk by the damage inflicted by . The Germans also sank the minesweeper and damaged the destroyers , &quot;Obedient&quot;, and &quot;Obdurate&quot;. In return, the British sank and damaged , and forced the Germans to abandon the attack on the convoy. In the aftermath of the failed operation, a furious Hitler proclaimed that the &#x27;s surface forces would be paid off and dismantled, and their guns used to reinforce the fortifications of the Atlantic Wall. Admiral Karl Dönitz, Raeder&#x27;s successor, persuaded Hitler to retain the surface fleet, however. After returning to Altafjord, emergency repairs to were effected, which allowed her to return to Bogen Bay on 23 January 1943. That day, , , and the destroyer left the Altafjord to return to Germany. The three ships stopped in Narvik on 25 January, and in Trondheim from 30 January to 2 February. After resuming the voyage south, the ships searched for Norwegian blockade runners in the Skagerrak on 6 February before putting into port at Kiel on 8 February. On 28 February, the ship was decommissioned in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s decree.

=== Fate ===
 received only basic repairs so that in April the ship could be towed to Pillau in the Baltic, to put her out of the reach of Allied bombers. On 1 March 1944 the was recommissioned in her damaged state as a training ship for cadets in Gotenhafen. During the next five months executed gunnery and sea training in the Baltic. In September she was reported conditionally operational and on 27 October the cadets graduated. In November there were plans drafted to use her for shore bombardments, but as the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction work on the defenses of the city, further impairing ″s ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.

By the end of 1944, the ship was due for another overhaul; work was to have lasted for three months. The Soviet Army had advanced so far, however, that it was necessary to move the ship farther away from the front, despite the fact that she had only one working turbine. On 29 January 1945, the ship left Gotenhafen with 1,377 refugees embarked, escorted by the torpedo boat . On the evening of the 30th, received a distress call from the sinking transport , which was also carrying refugees. The cruiser did not stop to pick up survivors due to the threat of the submarine that sank ; it would instead become one of the worst maritime disasters in history.

 arrived in Kiel on 2 February and entered the shipyard for refitting. On 3 April, RAF bombers attacked the harbor and hit the with one bomb which failed to penetrate the armor deck but caused six deaths amongst the crew. In the night of 9 April the RAF attacked the port with 591 heavy bombers. The bombers hit several ships in the harbor: capsized, the light cruiser was hit, and was severely damaged by three bomb hits. Munitions for her heavy artillery were brought aboard with the idea to operate her as a floating battery, but her crew scuttled the wrecked ship at her moorings at 04:25 on 3 May. In July 1945, after the end of the war, was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay and subsequently broken up for scrap in 1948–1952. Her bell was on display at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. The bell has since been returned to Germany and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel.

<text>Jim Marurai (9 July 1947 – November 2020) was a Cook Islands politician who served as Prime Minister of the Cook Islands. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Personal life==

Marurai was born in Ivirua, Mangaia. He attended Ivirua and Oneroa Primary school and then Tereora College on Rarotonga and Napier Boys&#x27; High School in New Zealand. He later studied to be a teacher at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.

Marurai&#x27;s wife, Tuaine Marurai, died on 14 September 2005 in Auckland, New Zealand, at the age of 56 after suffering from cancer. She was buried on her home island of Mangaia.

In March 2020 Marurai went missing from his home but was found after two days. He died in the first week of November 2020 in his home in Ivirua.

==Political career==

Marurai was first elected to Parliament in a by-election in 1994. He served as an opposition backbencher for his first term, and joined Norman George in splitting from the Democrats to form the New Alliance Party. Following the 1999 election he was appointed Minister of Education in the coalition Cabinets of Geoffrey Henry and Joe Williams. He retained the portfolio under both succeeding Prime Ministers, Terepai Maoate and Robert Woonton.

===Prime minister===

Marurai was re-elected at the 2004 election. When Prime Minister Robert Woonton was expelled from the Democratic party for forming a coalition with the Cook Islands Party, Marurai joined him in the newly formed Demo Party Tumu (later known as Cook Islands First). When an electoral petition found Woonton&#x27;s seat was a dead tie, Woonton resigned, and Marurai was elected Prime Minister. Initially he governed in coalition with the Cook Islands Party as part of a power-sharing deal which would see CIP leader Geoffrey Henry become Prime Minister after two years, but in August 2005 the agreement broke down and Marurai formed a new coalition with the Democrats. Terepai Maoate became Deputy Prime Minister again, and a month later the remaining CIP Cabinet Ministers were sacked and replaced by Democrats.

In October 2005 Marurai suspended Police Minister Peri Vaevae Pare from Cabinet over an allegation of wrongful use of public funds; Pare was subsequently asked to resign after he was convicted in January 2006. In March 2006 two government MP&#x27;s crossed the floor and sided with the opposition in an unsuccessful plot to bring down the government. The High Commissioner to New Zealand, former prime minister Rober Woonton, was sacked for his involvement in the plot. The resulting deadlock in Parliament was broken when Environment Minister Teina Bishop resigned and joined the opposition and the Cook Islands Party won the 2006 Matavera by-election. To avoid a confidence vote, Marurai dissolved Parliament and called a snap election. 
The Democratic Party won the resulting 2006 election and agreed to back Marurai as Prime Minister again. Shortly after the election his government pushed a controversial Media Standards Bill to regulate the media. In May 2007 Marurai attended the 8th Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders in Washington, D.C., and expressed disappointment with the lack of commitments by the United States. In August 2007 he hosted New Zealand Governor-General Anand Satyanand, and in October he made a state visit to China.

Marurai&#x27;s coalition came under strain in early 2008, with an outbreak of bickering and calls for Ministers to be sacked. In late 2008 Foreign Minister Wilkie Rasmussen publicly called for both Marurai and his deputy Maoate to step down. In July 2009 Rasmussen was sacked for plotting with the opposition. In December, a million dollar legal settlement from a failed bid to buy the Toa fuel tank farm led to the sacking of Maoate and a walkout of Democrats from Cabinet. Marurai was subsequently expelled from the Democratic Party. In January 2010, with both the Democrats and the Cook Islands Party opposed to his premiership, Marurai announced that he would not be &quot;calling parliament for at least several months&quot; as no sitting was required until it was necessary to pass a budget. He later announced that he had no intention of calling Parliament until September.

Marurai was readmitted to the Democratic party at a party conference in June 2010. He subsequently announced that he would not continue as Prime Minister if the Democratic Party won the 2010 election. Marurai was re-elected to his Ivirua seat in the 2010 elections, but his party was ousted. He resigned as Prime Minister on 29 November 2010, but continued to serve as a backbench MP.

Despite saying that the 2010 term would be his last, Marurai stood again for Ivirua in the 2014 election and was elected unopposed. He resigned for health reasons in 2017. The subsequent 2017 Ivirua by-election was won by Tony Armstrong.

<doc id="1290760" wikidata="Q402382" url="?curid=1290760" title="Ahom dynasty">
<text>The Ahom dynasty (1228–1826) ruled the Ahom Kingdom in present-day Assam, India for nearly 598 years. The dynasty was established by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince of Mong Mao (present-day Yunnan, China) who came to Assam after crossing the Patkai mountains. The rule of this dynasty ended with the Burmese invasion of Assam and the subsequent annexation by the British East India Company following the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826.

In external medieval chronicles the kings of this dynasty were called &quot;Asam Raja&quot;, whereas the subjects of the kingdom called them &quot;Chaopha&quot;, or &quot;Swargadeo&quot; (in Assamese).

== Ahom Kingdom (Chao-Pha / Swargadeo) ==

The office of the Ahom king, was reserved exclusively for the descendants of the first king Sukaphaa (1228–1268) who came to Assam from Mong Mao in 1228. Succession was by agnatic primogeniture. Nevertheless, following Rudra Singha&#x27;s deathbed injunction four of his five sons became the king one after the other. The descendants of Sukaphaa were not eligible for ministerial positions—a division of power that was followed till the end of the dynasty and the kingdom. When the nobles asked Atan Burhagohain to become the king, the Tai priests rejected the idea and he desisted from ascending the throne.

The king could be appointed only with the concurrence of the (council of ministers—Burhagohain, Borgohain, Borpatrogohain, Borbarua and Borphukan). During three periods in the 14th century, the kingdom had no kings when acceptable candidates were not found. The ministers could remove unacceptable kings, and it used to involve executing the erstwhile king. In the 17th century a power struggle and the increasing number of claimants to the throne resulted in kings being deposed in quick succession, all of whom were executed after the new king was instated. To prevent this bloody end, a new rule was introduced during the reign of Sulikphaa Lora Roja—claimants to the throne had to be physically unblemished—which meant that threats to the throne could be removed by merely slitting the ear of an ambitious prince. Rudra Singha, suspecting his brother Lechai&#x27;s intention, mutilated and banished him. The problem of succession remained, and on his deathbed, he instructed that all his sons were to become kings. One of his sons, Mohanmala Gohain, was superseded, who went on to lead a rebel group during the Moamoria rebellion. The later kings and officers exploited the unblemished rule, leading to weak kings being instated. Kamaleswar Singha (2-year-old son of Kadam Dighala) and Purandar Singha (10-year-old son of Brajanath and one of the last kings of this dynasty) came into office because their fathers were mutilated.

The Ahom kings were given divine origin. According to Ahom tradition, Sukaphaa was a descendant of Khunlung, the grandson of the king of the heavens Leungdon, who had come down from the heavens and ruled Mong-Ri-Mong-Ram. During the reign of Suhungmung (1497–1539) which saw the composition of the first Assamese Buranji and increased Hindu influence, the Ahom kings were traced to the union of Indra (identified with Lengdon) and Syama (a low-caste woman), and were declared &quot;Indravamsa kshatriyas&quot;, a lineage created exclusively for the Ahoms. Suhungmung adopted the title &quot;Swarganarayan&quot;, and the later kings were called Swargadeo&#x27;s (literal meaning: &quot;Lord of the Heavens&quot;). It was during his reign that the Buranji titled &quot;Sri Sri Swarganarayan Maharajor Jonmokotha&quot; was written wherein the source and lineage of the Ahom kings was connected to the Hindu God, Indra, Lord of the Heaven.

===Coronation===
The Swargadeo&#x27;s coronation was called Singarigharutha, a ceremony that was performed first by Sudangphaa (&quot;Bamuni Konwar&quot;) (1397–1407). The first coins in the new king&#x27;s name were minted during the reign of Sutamla. Kamaleswar Singha (1795–1811) and Chandrakanta Singha&#x27;s (1811–1818) coronations were not performed on the advice of Prime minister Purnananda Burhagohain, due to the financial constraints of State treasury caused by the internal disturbances during Moamoria rebellion. Kings who died in office were buried in vaults called Moidam, at Charaideo. Some of the later Maidams, beginning from the reign of Rajeswar Singha (1751–1769) were constructed to bury the ashes of those cremated. 

On ascent, the king would generally assume an Ahom name decided by the Ahom priests. The name generally ended in &quot;Pha&quot; (Tai: Heaven), e.g. Susenghphaa. Later kings also assumed a Hindu name that ended in &quot;Singha&quot; (Assamese: Lion): Susengphaa assumed the name &quot;Pratap Singha&quot;. Buranjis occasionally would refer to a past king by a more informal and colourful name that focused on a specific aspect of the king Pratap Singha was also known as &quot;Burha Roja&quot; (Assamese: Old King) because when Pratap Singha became the king, he was quite advanced in age.

===Royal offices===
Subinphaa (1281–1293), the third Ahom king, delineated the &quot;Satghariya Ahom&quot;, the Ahom aristocracy of the Seven Houses. Of this, the first lineage was that of the king. The next two were the lineages of the Burhagohain and the Borgohain. The last four were priestly lineages. Sukhrangpha (1332–1364) established the position of Charing Raja which came to be reserved for the heir apparent. The first Charing Raja was Sukhramphaa&#x27;s half-brother, Chao Pulai, the son of the Kamata princess Rajani, but who did not ultimately become the Swargadeo. Suhungmung &quot;Dihingia Raja&quot; (1497–1539) settled the descendants of past kings in different regions that gave rise to seven royal houses—&quot;Saringiya&quot;, &quot;Tipamiya&quot;, &quot;Dihingiya&quot;, &quot;Samuguriya&quot;, &quot;Tungkhungiya&quot;, &quot;Parvatiya&quot; and &quot;Namrupiya&quot;—and periods of Ahom rule came to be known after these families. The rule of the last such house, Tungkhungiya, was established by Gadadhar Singha (1681–1696) and his descendants ruled till the end of the Ahom kingdom.

===Queens===

Ahom queens (&quot;Kunworis&quot;) played important roles in the matter of state. They were officially designated in a gradation of positions, called the &quot;Bor Kuwori&quot; (Chief Queen), &quot;Parvatia Kuwori&quot;, &quot;Raidangia Kuwori&quot;, &quot;Tamuli Kuwori&quot;, etc. who were generally daughters of Ahom noblemen and high officials. Lesser wives of the Swargadeo were called &quot;Chamua Kunworis&quot;. Some of the queens were given separate estates that were looked after by state officials (Phukans or Baruas). During the reign of Siva Singha (1714–1744), the king gave his royal umbrella and royal insignia to his queens—Phuleshwari kunwori, Ambika Kunwori and Anadari Kunwori in succession— to rule the kingdom. They were called &quot;Bor-Rojaa&quot;. Some queens maintained office even after the death or removal of the kings, as happened with Pakhori Gabhoru and Kuranganayani who were queens to multiple kings.

One way in which the importance of the queens can be seen is that many of them are named on coins; typically the king&#x27;s name would be on the obverse of the coin and the queen&#x27;s on the reverse.

===Court influences===

Sukaphaa&#x27;s ruling deity was &quot;Chum-Pha&quot; and &quot;Sheng-mung&quot; a pair of non-Hindu, non-Buddhist gods, and he was accompanied by classes of priests called &quot;Deodhai&quot;, &quot;Bailung&quot; etc. But the Ahom kings let themselves be influenced by the religion and customs of those they ruled over. Sudangphaa &quot;Bamuni Konwar&quot; (1397–1407) installed a Brahmin of Habung, in whose household he was born and raised, as his adviser, but he himself did not convert to Hinduism. Susenphaa (1439–1488) constructed a temple at Negheriting. Suhungmung &quot;Dihingia Rojaa&quot; (1497–1539) was the first Ahom king to expand the kingdom and the polity, allow Assamese influence in his court and accept a non-Ahom title—&quot;Swarganarayan&quot;. Sukhaamphaa &quot;Khora Rojaa&quot; (1552–1603) began consulting Hindu astrologers alongside the traditional &quot;Deodhai-Bailung&quot; priests, and Pratap Singha (1603–1641) installed 13 Brahmin families as diplomats. Assamese language coexisted with Tai language in the court till the reign of Pratap Singha, during whose rule Assamese became dominant. Sutamla (1648–1663) was the first Ahom king to be initiated into the Mahapuruxiya Dharma, and Ahom kings till Sulikphaa &quot;lora roja&quot; (1679–1681) continued to be disciples of one sattra or the other. Mahapuruxiya pontiffs belonging to different sects began playing a greater role in state politics. After the chaos of the late 17th century, Gadadhar Sinha (1681–1696), the first Tungkhungiya king began his rule with a deep distrust of these religious groups. His son and successor Rudra Singha (1696–1714) searched for an alternative state religion, and his son and successor Siva Singha (1714–1744) formally adopted Saktism, the nemesis of the Mahapuruxiya sects. The persecution of the Mahapuruxiya Sattras under the Tunkhungiya rulers following Siba Singha was a crucial factor leading to the Moamoria rebellion that greatly depleted the Ahom kingdom.

===King&#x27;s Guards===

The king was guarded by a six thousand strong household troop under a &quot;Bhitarual Phukan&quot;. A unit of musketeers consisting of the king&#x27;s relatives was established by Sukhaamphaa alias Khora Raja that protected the capital (under the &quot;Bajua Hilaidari Konwar&quot;) and the palace and environs (&quot;Bhitarual Hilaidari Konwar&quot;).

The protection of the king was strictly taken into measure. Several classes of highly trusted guards were entrusted with the duty of protecting the king, which were duly supervised by the superior officers. (i) &quot;Hendangdhara&quot; or persons wielding hengdang were the personal bodyguards of the king. (ii) &quot;Chabukdhara&quot;, wielding whip, preceded the king whenever he moved out. (iii) &quot;Da-dhara&quot; or guards holding swords accompanied the king on his side. (iv) &quot;Dangdhara&quot; or guards carrying baton, moved around the side of the king.

===Patronage to Art===
The Ahom kings particularly of the tungkhungia house were great patrons of art, they encouraged the art of manuscript painting. Under their patronage, a great number of highly illustrated manuscripts were produced and a new school of art emerged as the &#x27;Garhgaon school&#x27;. This school of art broke away from the already existing &#x27;Sattriya school&#x27;, with much secular influence. Richly illustrated manuscripts such as– Gita Govinda, Dharma Purana, Sankachura Vadh, Hastividyarnava, Ananda Lahiri, Bhagavata Purana VI, Brhamavaivarta Purana, etc., are all products of the royal court.

==Timeline==
==Swargadeo dynastic lineage==
In the nearly 600-years 39-Swargadeo dynastic history, there are three progenitor kings (all subsequent kings are descendants of these kings). They are Sukaphaa, who established the kingdom; Suhungmung, who made the greatest territorial and political expansion of the kingdom; and Supaatphaa, who established the House of Tungkhugia kings that reigned the kingdom during its political and cultural zenith, as well as the period of decay and end (except for Jogeswar Singha, who was a descendant of Supaatphaa&#x27;s father Gobar, and who was installed as a puppet king by the Burmese).

The dynastic history and dates that are accepted today are the result of a re-examination of Ahom and other documents by a team of Nora astronomers and experts who were commissioned to do so by Gaurinath Singha (1780–1795).

<doc id="1290764" wikidata="Q1012440" url="?curid=1290764" title="Ranong">
<text>Ranong () is a town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) in southern Thailand, capital of the Ranong Province and the Mueang Ranong District. The town covers completely the area of the &quot;tambon&quot; Khao Niwet (เขานิเวศน์). As of 2005, it had a population of 16,163. Ranong lies south-southwest of Bangkok by road.

==Geography==
Ranong is on the estuary of the Pak Chan (or Kraburi) River, opposite Myanmar&#x27;s Kawthaung (formerly Victoria Point). The Tenasserim Hills rise directly to the east of Ranong, and another small ridge runs along the edge of the estuary to the town&#x27;s north.

==Climate==
Ranong has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;). There is little variation in the temperature throughout the year, although the pre-monsoon months (February to April) are somewhat hotter in the day. However, Ranong&#x27;s position to the west of the Tenasserim Hills means that the monsoon season&#x27;s rains are greatly amplified, resulting in torrential rains from May until October, and significant rainfall in the transition months of April and November.

==Transportation==
Phet Kasem Road (Thailand Route 4) runs through the city. Ranong Airport is about south of town.

The Port Authority of Thailand operates the Ranong Port, which is Thailand&#x27;s principal Indian Ocean port. In 2008, the Ranong human-smuggling incident resulted in 54 deaths. 

Several ferries are connecting to Kawthaung, Myanmar, which can be accessed by foreigners without visa. There also is a boat from Ranong to the Burmese resort island Thahtay Kyun.

<doc id="1290770" wikidata="Q6601426" url="?curid=1290770" title="List of Underground Railroad sites">
<text>The list of [[Underground Railroad]] sites includes abolitionist locations of sanctuary, support, and transport for former slaves in 19th century North America before and during the American Civil War. It also includes sites closely associated with people who worked to achieve personal freedom for all Americans in the movement to end slavery in the United States.

The list of validated or authenticated Underground Railroad and Network to Freedom sites is sorted within state or province, by location.

==Canada==
The Act Against Slavery of 1793 stated that any enslaved person would become free on arrival in Upper Canada. A network of routes led from the United States to Upper and Lower Canada. 

===Ontario===
# Amherstburg Freedom Museum – Amherstburg. The museum uses historical artifacts, Black heritage exhibits, and video presentations to share the story of how Africans were forced into slavery and the made their way to Canada.
# Fort Malden – Amherstburg One of the routes to Ontario was to cross Lake Erie from Sandusky, Ohio to Fort Malden. Another route to Fort Malden was traveling across the Detroit River into Canada and then across to Amherstburg. A number of fugitive slaves lived in the area and Isaac J. Rice established himself as a missionary, operating a school for black children.
# Buxton National Historic Site and Elgin settlement – Chatham, Ontario The Elgin settlement was established by a Presbyterian minister, Reverend William King, with fifteen former slaved on November 28, 1849. King came from Ohio, where he inherited fourteen enslaved people from his father-in-law and acquired another and set them free. King intended the Elgin settlement to a refuge for runaway enslaved people. The Buxton Mission was established at the settlement.
# Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin Historic Site and Dawn Settlement – Dresden. Rev. Josiah Henson, a former enslaved man who fled slavery via the Underground Railroad with his wife Nancy and their children, was a cofounder of the Dawn Settlement in 1841. Dawn Settlement was designed to be a community for black refugees, where children and adults could receive an education and develop skills so that they could prosper. They exported tobacco, grain, and black walnut lumber to the United States and Britain.
# John R. Park Homestead Conservation Area – Essex. The Park Homestead was a station on the Underground Railroad.
# John Freeman Walls Historic Site – Lakeshore. John Freeman Walls, left his enslavers in North Carolina and settled in Canada. The Refugee Home Society supplied the money to buy land and he built a cabin. Church services were held there before the Puce Baptist Church was built. It was also a terminal stop on the Underground Railroad. Walls and his family stayed in Canada after the American Civil War.
# Queen&#x27;s Bush – Mapleton. Beginning in 1820, African American pioneers settled in the open lands of Queen&#x27;s Bush. More than 1,500 blacks set up farms and created a community with churches and Mount Pleasant and Mount Hope schools, which were taught by American missionaries.
# St. Catharines – Harriet Tubman lived in St. Catharines and attended the Salem Chapel for ten years. After she freed herself from slavery, she helped other enslaved people reach freedom in Canada. The town was a final stop on the Underground Railroad for many people.
# Sandwich First Baptist Church – Windsor. The church was built just over the border from the United States in Windsor, Ontario by blacks who came to Canada to live free. For its role in the lives of its congregants and as a sanctuary for fugitive slaves, it was designated a National Historic Site in 1999.

===Nova Scotia===
African-American people settled in Nova Scotia since 1749.
# Birchtown National Historic Site – Birchtown. It was a settlement of black people from Colonial America, who served the British during the American Revolutionary War in exchange for their freedom. Birchtown was the largest community of free black people in British North America during the late 18th century.
# Africville – Halifax. Black people settled in Africville beginning in 1848. Black residents did not have the same services as white people, like clean water and sewers, and lived on land that was not arable. Some were able to make a living for themselves and build a community with a Baptist church, a school, stores, and a post office. A plan was initiated to relocate families and raze the site of the town.

<text>Babruysk Fortress (; ) is a historic fortress in the city of Babruysk, Belarus, that was built between 1810 and 1836. It is one of the best surviving examples of fortification architecture and design in the first half of the 19th century. The fortress was constructed in the historic center of the city, at the confluence of the Babruyka and Berezina rivers. It was one of the western Russian fortresses.

In 1810, Tsar Alexander I sent out his military engineer Teodor Narbutt to find a site suitable for building a fortress somewhere on the Dnieper, between Mogilev and Rogachev in order to prepare for the looming threat in Western Europe. However, after his investigation, Narbut advised his superiors that a more strategic position would be on the shore of the Berezina river near Babruysk. This decision was approved by the Chief of Military Engineers, Count Carl Operman, who at the time had authority over all of Russian forts. On June 4, 1810, the Tsar issued an order for the Babruysk fortress to be constructed. Narbut had to resign for health reasons and was replaced by General Major Gabriel Ignatiev.

The early fortress comprised five bastions, multiple soil ridges, and water channels. The basis for the Babruysk fortress was the Babruysk Jesuit house and a smaller Polish fortress, which were built earlier.

Only partially completed, the fortress had to face Napoleon&#x27;s invading army in the summer of 1812. After the French army captured Minsk, General Ignatiev took command of the fort and the city of Babruysk, which served as a holdout for the retreating Russian forces. Soldiers from The Second Russian Army were provided with food and the wounded received medical treatment. After that they were ferried by the Berezina and Dniper to Smolensk, where the main Russian army was stationed. General Ignatiev remained in the fortress and oversaw its defence.

The city faced an attack by the forces of General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, the Polish Corps Commander of Napoleon&#x27;s Army. The siege lasted for four months, however the fortress held until the French forces began their retreat. Throughout this time Ignatiev was instrumental in collecting intelligence and forwarding it to the high command of the Russian army.

Following the Napoleonic wars, in 1820, the fortress was further rapidly expanded by the addition of 18 more bastions and towers. The fort &quot;Freidrich Wilhelm&quot; was designed according to the plans of the architect A. Staubert in 1822. Tsar Alexander I himself and his brother arrived in Babruysk on September 24, 1825, at the completion of this building phase.

In 1892 the 1st Brigade of the 40th Infantry Division of the Imperial Russian Army was stationed here.

By 1900 the fortress lost its military significance and was converted into a jail. It was captured by the Polish I Corps in February 1918 and used by Polish forces during the Polish-Bolshevik War (1919—1920, about 1.000.000 deaths). During World War II, it was used as a concentration camp by German occupation forces (about 80,000 deaths).

The Babruysk Fortress was registered as a national architectural monument of Belarus.

<text>Hartford Ball Club Grounds was a baseball grounds in Hartford, Connecticut. It was home to the Hartford Dark Blues from 1874 to 1876, two years in the National Association and one in the National League.

The Hartford club remained in the League for 1877 but played its home games at Union Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, whose last professional tenant had gone out of business.

Contemporary maps show that the ballpark was bounded by Wyllys Street to the northwest and Hendricxsen Avenue to the northeast, with trees and residences along the south sides of the field. The stands were situated along Wyllys, and the diamond was set up with home plate pointing northwest. Across Hendricxsen to the northeast was the Church of the Good Shepherd, bounded by Van Block Avenue on its northeast side. In modern times, Hendricxsen ends at Masseek Street, well to the southeast, but the driveway from Wyllys into the church parking lot approximates the old Hendricxsen. The former ballpark site is a large lawn across from the church and the parking lot.

The Hartford Base Ball Grounds was marked with a memorial bronze plaque in July 2008. The effort was led by Ronald Bolin. In February 2009 the plaque was stolen. It was recovered in 2017 from a scrap yard in Massachusetts. No decision has been made on whether to place it back on the site. 

In June 2013, the bases were marked with commemorative granite slabs on their approximate original locations on the grounds field just in front of the Church of the Good Shepherd&#x27;s Caldwell Colt Memorial. The tribute was created and financed made by The Friends of Vintage Base Ball.

<text>This history of central banking in the United States encompasses various bank regulations, from early wildcat banking practices through the present Federal Reserve System.

==1781–1836: Bank of North America and First and Second Bank of the United States==

===Bank of North America===

Some Founding Fathers were strongly opposed to the formation of a national banking system. Russell Lee Norburn said the fundamental cause of the American Revolutionary War was conservative Bank of England policies failing to supply the colonies with money.

Others were strongly in favor of a national bank. Robert Morris, as Superintendent of Finance, helped to open the Bank of North America in 1782, and has been accordingly called by Thomas Goddard &quot;the father of the system of credit and paper circulation in the United States&quot;. As ratification in early 1781 of the Articles of Confederation had extended to Congress the sovereign power to generate bills of credit, it passed later that year an ordinance to incorporate a privately subscribed national bank following in the footsteps of the Bank of England. However, it was thwarted in fulfilling its intended role as a nationwide national bank due to objections of &quot;alarming foreign influence and fictitious credit&quot;, favoritism to foreigners and unfair policies against less corrupt state banks issuing their own notes, such that Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislature repealed its charter to operate within the Commonwealth in 1785.

===First Bank of the United States===
In 1791, former Morris aide and chief advocate for Northern mercantile interests, Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, accepted a compromise with the Southern lawmakers to ensure the continuation of Morris&#x27;s Bank project; in exchange for support by the South for a national bank, Hamilton agreed to ensure sufficient support to have the national or federal capitol moved from its temporary &quot;Northern&quot; location, New York, to a &quot;Southern&quot; location on the Potomac. As a result, the First Bank of the United States (1791–1811) was chartered by Congress within the year and signed by George Washington soon after. The First Bank of the United States was modeled after the Bank of England and differed in many ways from today&#x27;s central banks. For example, it was partly owned by foreigners, who shared in its profits. Also, it was not solely responsible for the country&#x27;s supply of bank notes. It was responsible for only 20% of the currency supply; state banks accounted for the rest. Several founding fathers bitterly opposed the bank. Thomas Jefferson saw it as an engine for speculation, financial manipulation, and corruption. In 1811 its twenty-year charter expired and was not renewed by Congress. Absent the federally chartered bank, the next several years witnessed a proliferation of federally issued Treasury Notes to create credit as the government struggled to finance the War of 1812; a suspension of specie payment by most banks soon followed as well.

===Second Bank of the United States===

After five years, the federal government chartered its successor, the Second Bank of the United States (1816–1836). James Madison signed the charter with the intention of stopping runaway inflation that had plagued the country during the five-year interim. It was essentially a copy of the First Bank, with branches across the country. Andrew Jackson, who became president in 1829, denounced the bank as an engine of corruption. His destruction of the bank was a major political issue in the 1830s and shaped the Second Party System, as Democrats in the states opposed banks and Whigs supported them. He was unable to get the bank dissolved, but refused to renew its charter. Jackson attempted to counteract this by executive order requiring all federal land payments to be made in gold or silver, in accordance with his interpretation of The Constitution of the United States, which only gives Congress the power to &quot;coin&quot; money, not emit bills of credit. The Panic of 1837 followed. The bank then flatly denied a subpoena to examine its records and its chief, Nicholas Biddle, bemusedly observed that it would be ironic if he went to prison &quot;By the votes of members of Congress because I would not give up to their enemies their confidential letters&quot;. Biddle was eventually arrested and charged with fraud. The bank&#x27;s charter expired in 1836.

==1837–1862: &quot;Free banking&quot; era==


In this period, only state-chartered banks existed. They could issue bank notes against specie (gold and silver coins) and the states heavily regulated their own reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. These banks had existed since 1781, in parallel with the Banks of the United States. The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature. This legislation made creating unstable banks easier by lowering state supervision in states that adopted it. The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing bank&#x27;s financial strength generally determined the size of the discount. By 1797 there were 24 chartered banks in the U.S.; with the beginning of the &quot;free banking era&quot; (1837) there were 712.
During the free banking era, the banks were short-lived compared to today&#x27;s commercial banks, with an average lifespan of five years. About half of the banks failed, and about a third of which went out of business because they could not redeem their notes. (See also &quot;Wildcat banking&quot;.)

During the free banking era, some local banks took over the functions of a central bank. In New York, the New York Safety Fund provided deposit insurance for member banks. In Boston, the Suffolk Bank guaranteed that bank notes would trade at near par value, and acted as a private bank note clearinghouse.

==1863–1913: National banks==
The National Banking Act of 1863, besides providing loans in the Civil War effort of the Union, included provisions:

* To create a system of national banks. They were to have higher standards concerning reserves and business practices than state banks. Recent research indicates that state monopoly banks had the lowest long run survival rates. The office of Comptroller of the Currency was created to supervise these banks.
* To create a uniform national currency. To achieve this, all national banks were required to accept each other&#x27;s currencies at par value. This eliminated the risk of loss in case of bank default. The notes were printed by the Comptroller of the Currency to ensure uniform quality and prevent counterfeiting.
* To finance the war, national banks were required to secure their notes by holding Treasury securities, enlarging the market and raising its liquidity.

As described by Gresham&#x27;s law, soon bad money from state banks drove out the new, good money; the government imposed a 10% tax on state bank bills, forcing most banks to convert to national banks. By 1865, there were already 1,500 national banks. In 1870, 1,638 national banks stood against only 325 state banks. The tax led in the 1880s and 1890s to the creation and adoption of checking accounts. By the 1890s, 90% of the money supply was in checking accounts. State banking had made a comeback.

Two problems still remained in the banking sector. The first was the requirement to back up the currency with treasuries. When the treasuries fluctuated in value, banks had to recall loans or borrow from other banks or clearinghouses. The second problem was that the system created seasonal liquidity spikes. A rural bank had deposit accounts at a larger bank, that it withdrew from when the need for funds was highest, e.g., in the planting season.

These liquidity crises led to bank runs, causing severe disruptions and depressions. The Panic of 1907 was one of the worst panics in US history. The resulting hearings led to creating a lender of last resort.

National banks issued National Bank Notes as currency. Because they were uniformly backed by US government debt, they generally traded at comparable values in contrast to the notes issued during the Free Banking era in which notes from different banks could have significantly different values. National bank notes were not however &quot;lawful tender&quot;, and could not be used as bank reserves under the National Bank Act. The Federal government issued greenbacks which fulfilled this role along with gold.

Congress suspended the gold standard in 1861 early in the Civil War and began issuing paper currency (greenbacks). The federally issued greenbacks were gradually supposed to be eliminated in favor of national bank notes after the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 was passed. However, the elimination of the greenbacks was suspended in 1878 and the notes remained in circulation. Federal debt throughout the period continued to be paid in gold. In 1879, the United States had returned to the gold standard, and all currency could be redeemed in gold.

==1907–1913: Creation of the Federal Reserve System==

===Panic of 1907 alarms bankers===
Early in 1907, New York Times Annual Financial Review published Paul Warburg&#x27;s (a partner of Kuhn, Loeb and Co.) first official reform plan, entitled &quot;A Plan for a Modified Central Bank&quot;, in which he outlined remedies that he thought might avert panics. Early in 1907, Jacob Schiff, the chief executive officer of Kuhn, Loeb and Co., in a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce, warned that &quot;unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history.&quot; &quot;The Panic of 1907&quot; hit full stride in October. [Herrick]
Bankers felt the real problem was that the United States was the last major country without a central bank, which might provide stability and emergency credit in times of financial crisis. While segments of the financial community were worried about the power that had accrued to JP Morgan and other financiers, most were more concerned about the general frailty of a vast, decentralized banking system that could not regulate itself without the extraordinary intervention of one man. Financial leaders who advocated a central bank with an elastic currency after the Panic of 1907 included Frank Vanderlip, Myron T. Herrick, William Barret Ridgely, George E. Roberts, Isaac Newton Seligman and Jacob H. Schiff. They stressed the need for an elastic money supply that could expand or contract as needed. After the scare of 1907 the bankers demanded reform; the next year, Congress established a commission of experts to come up with a nonpartisan solution.

===Aldrich Plan===
Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich, the Republican leader in the Senate, ran the Commission personally, with the aid of a team of economists. They went to Europe and were impressed with how the central banks in Britain and Germany appeared to handle the stabilization of the overall economy and the promotion of international trade. Aldrich&#x27;s investigation led to his plan in 1912 to bring central banking to the United States, with promises of financial stability, expanded international roles, control by impartial experts and no political meddling in finance. Aldrich asserted that a central bank had to be, paradoxically, decentralized somehow, or it would be attacked by local politicians and bankers as had the First and Second Banks of the United States. The Aldrich plan was introduced in the 62nd and 63rd Congresses (1912 and 1913) but never gained much traction as the Democrats in 1912 won control of both the House and the Senate as well as the White House.

===A regional Federal Reserve system===

The new president, Woodrow Wilson, then became the principal mover for banking and currency reform in the 63rd Congress, working with the two chairs of the House and Senate Banking and Currency Committees, Rep. Carter Glass of Virginia and Sen. Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma. It was Wilson who insisted that the regional Federal Reserve banks be controlled by a central Federal Reserve Board appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.

===Agrarian demands partly met===
William Jennings Bryan, now Secretary of State, long-time enemy of Wall Street and still a power in the Democratic Party, threatened to destroy the bill. Wilson came up with a compromise plan that pleased bankers and Bryan alike. The Bryanites were happy that Federal Reserve currency became liabilities of the government rather than of private banks—a symbolic change—and by provisions for federal loans to farmers. The Bryanite demand to prohibit interlocking directorates did not pass. Wilson convinced the anti-bank Congressmen that because Federal Reserve notes were obligations of the government, the plan fit their demands. Wilson assured southerners and westerners that the system was decentralized into 12 districts, and thus would weaken New York City&#x27;s Wall Street influence and strengthen the hinterlands. After much debate and many amendments, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act or &quot;Glass–Owen Act,&quot; as it was sometimes called at the time, in late 1913. President Wilson signed the Act into law on December 23, 1913.

==Since 1913: The Federal Reserve==
The Federal Reserve System, also known as the Federal Reserve or simply as the Fed, is the central banking system of the United States today. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s power developed slowly in part due to an understanding at its creation that it was to function primarily as a reserve, a money-creator of last resort to prevent the downward spiral of withdrawal/withholding of funds which characterizes a monetary panic. At the outbreak of World War I, the Federal Reserve was better positioned than the United States Department of the Treasury to issue war bonds, and so became the primary retailer for war bonds under the direction of the Treasury. After the war, the Federal Reserve, led by Paul Warburg and New York Governor Bank President Benjamin Strong, convinced Congress to modify its powers, giving it the ability to both create money, as the 1913 Act intended, and destroy money, as a central bank could.

During the 1920s, the Federal Reserve experimented with a number of approaches, alternatively creating and then destroying money which, in the eyes of Milton Friedman, helped create the late-1920s stock market bubble and the Great Depression.

After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, the Federal Reserve was subordinated to the Executive Branch, where it remained until 1951, when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury department signed an accord granting the Federal Reserve full independence over monetary matters while leaving fiscal matters to the Treasury.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary powers did not dramatically change for the rest of the 20th century, but in the 1970s it was specifically charged by Congress to effectively promote &quot;the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates&quot; as well as given regulatory responsibility over many consumer credit protection laws.

Since the Global Financial Crisis, central banks globally (including the Federal Reserve) have implemented several experimental Unconventional Monetary Policy Tools (UMPS) in order to achieve their monetary policy objectives.

<doc id="1290785" wikidata="Q4207871" url="?curid=1290785" title="Alyxia stellata">
<text>Alyxia stellata, known as maile in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family, &quot;Apocynaceae&quot;, that is native to Hawaii. It grows as either a twining liana, scandent shrub, or small erect shrub, and is one of the few vines that are endemic to the islands. The leaves are usually ternate, sometimes opposite, and can show both types on the same stem. Flowers are quite inconspicuous and have a sweet and light fragrance of honey. The bark is most fragrant and exudes a slightly sticky, milky sap when punctured, characteristic of the family Apocynaceae. The entire plant contains coumarin, a sweet-smelling compound that is also present in vanilla grass (&quot;Anthoxanthum odoratum&quot;), woodruff (&quot;Galium odoratum&quot;) and mullein (&quot;Verbascum&quot; spp.). Fruit are oval and dark purple when ripe. &quot;Maile&quot; is a morphologically variable plant and the Hawaiian names reflect this (see Ethnobotany section).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Maile&quot; can occur in most types of vegetation at elevations from on all of the main Hawaiian Islands, however it is believed that both Kahoolawe and Niihau likely had populations of the species before large-scale disturbances occurred. Lowland wet forests occur from elevation in the Hawaiian Islands and are prime habitat for &quot;maile&quot;, receiving of rainfall annually. &quot;Maile&quot; is also found in montane mesic and wet communities.

== Ethnobotanical uses ==
=== Lei ===
&quot;Maile&quot; is traditionally and still most popularly used in &quot;lei&quot;. The vines are prepared and twined together to make an open &quot;lei&quot; or if people prefer they can close it. In more rural areas it is typical for someone to pick their own &quot;maile&quot; if accessible, however because &quot;lei maile&quot; is so desirable, many floral shops carry these kinds of lei. It is one of the only endemic Hawaiian plants grown commercially for lei. Commercial &quot;maile&quot; plantations have become more common as some people feel that imported (non-Hawaiian) &quot;maile&quot; is not as fragrant as Hawaiian &quot;maile&quot;.

=== Lāau Lapaau ===
This plant was used medicinally to treat &quot;puho&quot;, &quot;puka puhi&quot;, &quot;kaupo&quot;, and &quot; na eha moku kukonukonu e ae&quot; (other cuts). &quot;Maile kaluhea&quot; was mashed with &quot;aukoi&quot; (&quot;Senna occidentalis&quot;) stalks, &quot;ahakea&quot; (&quot;Bobea&quot; spp.) and &quot;koa&quot; (&quot;Acacia koa&quot;) bark. After water is added to this mixture and heated, it is put on infected areas to clean.

=== Local tradition ===
&quot;Lei maile&quot; are often worn by the groom, and also by the groom&#x27;s men in weddings which is a lovely sight. For high school proms in Hawaii, the boy is often given a &quot;lei maile&quot;. Birthdays, graduations, anniversaries and any celebration for that matter are all an occasion for &quot;lei maile&quot;, however many responsible stewards to the land understand there is not enough &quot;maile&quot; to go around for everyone. This ties back in to local &quot;maile&quot; plantations that have started up.

=== Kapa ===
Kapa, pounded wauke (&quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;) is traditionally scented using fragrant plants such as &quot;maile&quot;, &quot;mokihana&quot; (&quot;Melicope anisata&quot;), &quot;lauae&quot; (&quot;Phymatosorus scolopendria&quot;), &quot;iliahi&quot; (&quot;Santalum&quot; spp.) and &quot;kamani&quot; (&quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;).

== Conservation ==
Because &quot;maile&quot; is desirable for harvesting it is often incorporated into restoration plantings which can help bring the community into the conservation process. One study looked at the potential of planting native Hawaiian plants as an understory layer to reduce weedy seedlings from sprouting up and gaining hold again in a restored area. &quot;Maile&quot;, &quot;māmaki&quot; (&quot;Pipturus albidus&quot;) and &quot;palapalai&quot; (&quot;Microlepia strigosa&quot;) were the plants used.

== Folklore ==
Mention of the maile plant occurs in various stories (&quot;moolelo&quot;), proverbs (&quot;ōlelo noeau&quot;), and in the song (&quot;mele&quot;) &quot;Lei Awapuhi&quot;.

===Lāieikawai===
The maile sisters are a favorite stock characters in Hawaiian romance tales. The story of Lāieikawai tells of five &quot;Maile&quot; sisters. &quot;Maile hai wale&quot; (brittle &quot;maile&quot;), &quot;Maile lau lii&quot; (small-leaved &quot;maile&quot;), &quot;Maile lau nui&quot; (large-leaved &quot;maile&quot;), &quot;Maile kaluhea&quot; (sweet-scented &quot;maile&quot;), and &quot;Maile pakaha&quot; (blunt-leaved &quot;maile&quot;).
Kauai&#x27;s &quot;maile lau lii&quot; is often celebrated in song and chant. The ōlelo noeau, &quot;Ka maile lau lii o Koiahi&quot; speaks of the &quot;fine-leaved&quot; &quot;maile&quot; of Kokee, Kauai which had one of the best and most fragrant &quot;maile lau lii&quot; in Hawaii and was praised in old chants. Because &quot;maile&quot; was often placed on &quot;heiau&quot; in traditional times, the older generations of Hawaiians say that the fragrance of maile still lingers in those areas where &quot;heiau&quot; once stood or are still standing.

===Puna and Panaewa===
Several ōlelo noeau from the Hilo and Puna districts on Hawaii Island paint a wonderfully fragrant picture of Puna and Panaewa. &quot;Ka makani hali ala o Puna&quot;, the fragrance-bearing wind of Puna; , Hanakahi is adorned with the fragrance and perfume of Panaewa. These were both places that had a moist climate suitable for maile and other fragrant ferns, as well as the famous hala (&quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;) from Puna. The phrase &quot;Puna paia ala&quot;, fragrant walls of Puna, gives reference to the &quot;hīnano&quot; blossom which was famously hung inside &quot;hale&quot; of that district to scent the house. People traveled to both Puna and Panaewa in order to pick maile, hence those areas being remembered as fragrant.

===Mōlī===
Mary Kawena Pukui tells a story from Kaū on Hawaii Island of a beautiful young woman, Mōlī, whose father will let none other than a fisherman marry her (a good fisherman is well liked and prosperous because of the food he catches; it is also a sign of a much desired hard-working man). A certain worthless fisherman who tricked Mōlī&#x27;s father by rubbing fish guts (which were thrown out by others) on himself took her hand in marriage and did no work afterwards. Driven to desperation, Mōlī decorated herself with a beautiful lei of ginger (&quot;Zingiber zerumbet&quot;), fern and &quot;maile&quot; and threw herself over the cliffs at Waiahukini. It is said each year around the time of her death, Mōlī returns and when the wind blows, moaning and wailing can be heard. The &quot;maile&quot; fragrance of her lei can also be smelled and if anyone goes there wearing a &quot;maile&quot; lei, they will be knocked to the ground.

=== Keaoua Kekuaokalani ===
Keaoua Kekuaokalani, a cousin to Liholiho (Kamehameha II), objected to the overturn of the &quot;kapu&quot; system and with supporters, they gathered together with weapons at the battle of Kuamoo in attempt to restore the &quot;kapu&quot; taken away. Hawaiians from the area where the battle took place hold that the fragrance of &quot;maile&quot; worn by the Kekuaokalani&#x27;s warriors into battle can still be smelled.

<text>Criggion Radio Station was a transmitter site latterly operated by BT on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence. It was located near the village of Criggion in the parish of Bausley with Criggion, which lies in the county of Powys, Wales.

It was established in World War II as a back-up unit for Rugby Radio Station and took over the latter&#x27;s traffic for a short period in 1943 following a fire at Rugby. Operating on 19.6 kHz with the callsign GBZ, the station was used until its shutdown on 1 April 2003 for sending messages to submarines. This task (and that of Rugby) is now carried out by the Anthorn radio station. Criggion&#x27;s VLF antenna was hung from three free-standing steel lattice towers at tall, three guyed masts at tall and a rock anchor. The towers and masts were demolished in August 2003 but, although there is now less obvious visible evidence that a large radio station existed on the site, the derelict main transmitting building still survived in 2011 and the foundation sites of the former masts can be still be located on satellite and aerial photographs.

 the remaining parts of the station were reported to be in a state of disrepair.

<doc id="1290793" wikidata="Q7089106" url="?curid=1290793" title="Olympic Park (Buffalo)">
<text>Olympic Park is the name shared by two former baseball grounds located in Buffalo, New York, United States.

== Prelude ==

From 1878 through 1883, Buffalo&#x27;s baseball teams had played at an initially unnamed ballpark at Fargo Avenue and Rhode Island Street. The club&#x27;s owners named it &quot;Riverside Park&quot; in 1882, although it was actually over from the Niagara River. The owner of the site, Alexander Culbert, decided to develop the property and the team left the site for Olympic Park (I).

== First Olympic Park==

Olympic Park (I) was home to the Buffalo Bisons baseball club of the National League for two seasons, 1884 and 1885. It was located on the block bounded by Richmond Avenue (west); Summer Street (south); and Norwood Avenue (east). After the National League dropped the Bisons franchise, professional baseball continued to be played there by the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, until the lease expired following the 1888 season. The last professional game in Olympic Park (I) was played on September 28, 1888, when the Buffalo Bisons played the Cuban Giants.

The site of Olympic Park (I) is currently occupied by a residential neighborhood, including the Richmond-Summer Recreation Center.

== Second Olympic Park ==

The Bisons found a new location at a block bounded by East Ferry Street (north, third base); Masten Avenue (east, left field); Woodlawn Avenue (south, right field); and Michigan Avenue (west, first base). This site would remain the primary location of Buffalo professional baseball through the 1960 season. In the late winter and early spring of 1889, the club&#x27;s owner had the existing (wooden) stands disassembled at the old location, and moved section by section to the new location. The club decided to continue the name because of its familiarity to the public, so it became the new Olympic Park (II).

The club held the grounds for the 1889 season, but in 1890 the Players&#x27; League version of the Bisons secured a lease on it. The minor league club had to find another location, and they played the season at grounds in the eastern part of the city, near Genesee Street and the Belt Line Railroad, which was primarily the home field of the amateur Buffalo Baseball League organization.

The Players&#x27; League folded after the 1890 season, enabling the minor league Bisons to move back to Olympic Park (II). This would be the Bisons&#x27; home stadium through the early part of the 1923 season. During the summer, they demolished the old wooden stands and began building a new set of stands in steel and concrete. It was originally named Bison Stadium, and in 1935 was renamed Offermann Stadium in memory of the club&#x27;s owner.

In addition to baseball, Olympic Park (II) was also used for football, serving as the home of the Buffalo All-Americans of the National Football League, and several iterations of the New York Pro Football League Championship. The UB Bisons college football squad played its games at the stadium until 1919, after which they moved to Rotary Field on-campus.

The site of Olympic Park (II) / Offermann Stadium is currently occupied by the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts and a church. In August 2012, a historical plaque was dedicated at the site in remembrance of over 72 years of baseball played on the grounds. Local Buffalo sports historian John Boutet spearheaded the project and raised the funds through the Facebook group Buffalo Sports Museum, the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bisons.

== &quot;Buffalo Baseball Park&quot; ==

In July 1907, Bisons&#x27; owner Alexander Potter announced that the ballpark was to be renamed, from Olympic Park to Buffalo Baseball Park. This decision was not binding on news writers, and the Olympic Park name was kept alive for years, by referring to &quot;Buffalo Baseball Park&quot; and &quot;Olympic Park&quot; interchangeably, or by saying &quot;Buffalo Baseball Park (formerly Olympic Park)&quot;. By the early 1920s, the name &quot;Olympic Park&quot; was fading from use. During the 1923 season, with construction on the new steel-and-concrete stadium under way, papers continuing calling it &quot;Buffalo Baseball Park&quot; and also &quot;new Bison stadium&quot;, unwittingly anticipating its new name. Meanwhile, the name &quot;Buffalo Baseball Park&quot; continued to be used, posted on the signs above the gates, even after Bison Stadium had been renamed Offermann Stadium in 1935. &quot;Buffalo Baseball Park&quot; continued to appear under that name in Buffalo city directories as late as 1957.

<doc id="1290795" wikidata="Q141798" url="?curid=1290795" title="Yucca pallida">
<text>Yucca pallida, sometimes called pale yucca, is a species of yucca native to Northern Mexico and parts of the blackland prairies of northern and central Texas, and notable for its light-colored leaves that range from a pale blue-gray to sage-green in color.

The rosettes average 20–50 cm tall and 30–80 cm in diameter, with leaves 15–40 cm long and 2–3 cm wide, being widest around the midpoint. The rosettes sit directly on the ground, with little or no trunk. The leaves have a yellow to brown terminal spine, and are generally flat, possibly with some waviness or rolling along the edges. The inflorescence is a panicle, 1–2.5 m tall, with up to 100 bell-shaped flowers, each 5–7 cm long, with color ranging from light green to cream.

&quot;Yucca pallida&quot; is known to hybridize with &quot;Yucca rupicola&quot; , which has a similar appearance, but whose leaves are more twisted and curved.

Although not common in horticulture, its color, size, and moderate hardiness (down to −18 °C or 0 °F) make it a good gardening alternative to other species of yuccas.

<doc id="1290796" wikidata="Q6784808" url="?curid=1290796" title="Massive resistance">
<text>Massive resistance was a political strategy created by American politicians Harry F. Byrd and James M. Thomson aimed at getting Virginia officials to pass laws and policies preventing public school desegregation, particularly after &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Many schools and an entire school system were shut down in 1958 and 1959 in attempts to block integration. 

This lasted until the Virginia Supreme Court and a special three-judge panel of federal district judges from the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting at Norfolk, declared those policies unconstitutional. Although most of the laws created to implement massive resistance were overturned by state and federal courts within a year, some aspects of the campaign against integrated public schools continued in Virginia for many more years.

==Byrd Organization and opposition to racial integration==

After Reconstruction ended in 1877 and the local Readjuster Party fell in the 1880s, Virginia&#x27;s conservative Democrats actively worked to maintain legal and cultural racial segregation in Virginia through the Jim Crow laws. To complete white supremacy, after the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), Virginia adopted a new constitution in 1902 effectively disenfranchising African Americans through restrictions on voter registration and also requiring racially segregated schools, among other features. In the early 20th century, Harry Flood Byrd (1887–1966), a Democrat who served as Governor of Virginia U.S., led the Byrd Organization. Continuing a legacy of segregationist Democrats, from the mid-1920s until the late 1960s the Byrd Organization was a political machine that effectively controlled Virginia politics through a network of courthouse cliques of local constitutional officers in most of the state&#x27;s counties. The Byrd Organization&#x27;s greatest strength was in the rural areas of the state. It never gained a significant foothold in the independent cities, nor with the emerging suburban middle-class of Virginians after World War II. One of the Byrd Organization&#x27;s most vocal, though moderate, long-term opponents proved to be Benjamin Muse, who served as a Democratic state senator from Petersburg, Virginia, then unsuccessfully ran for Governor as a Republican in 1941 and became a publisher and &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist.

Using legal challenges, by the 1940s, black attorneys who included Thurgood Marshall, Oliver W. Hill, William H. Hastie, Spottswood W. Robinson III and Leon A. Ransom were gradually winning civil rights cases based upon federal constitutional challenges. Among these was the case of &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;, which was initiated by students to protest poor conditions at R. R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. Their case became part of the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court decision in 1954. That decision overturned &quot;Plessy&quot; and declared that state laws that established separate public schools for black and white students denied black children equal educational opportunities and were inherently unequal. As a result, &quot;de jure&quot; (legalized) racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, thereby paving the way for desegregation and the Civil Rights Movement.

==Gray Commission==
A little more than a month after the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown&quot;, on June 26, 1954, Senator Byrd vowed to stop integration attempts in Virginia&#x27;s schools. By the end of that summer, Governor Thomas B. Stanley, a member of the Byrd Organization, had appointed a Commission on Public Education, consisting of 32 white Democrats and chaired by Virginia Senator Garland &quot;Peck&quot; Gray of rural Sussex County. This became known as the Gray Commission. Before the commission issued its final report on November 11, 1955, the Supreme Court had responded to segregationists&#x27; delaying tactics by issuing the &quot;Brown II&quot; decision and directing federal district judges to implement desegregation &quot;with all deliberate speed.&quot; The Gray Plan recommended that the General Assembly pass legislation and allow for amendment of the state constitution so as to repeal Virginia&#x27;s compulsory school attendance law, to allow the Governor to close schools rather than allow their integration, to establish pupil assignment structures, and finally to provide vouchers to parents who chose to enroll their children in segregated private schools. Virginia voters approved the Gray Plan Amendment on January 9, 1956.

==1956: Circumventing &quot;Brown&quot; via the Stanley Plan==
On February 24, 1956, Byrd declared a campaign which became known as &quot;massive resistance&quot; to avoid implementing public school integration in Virginia. Leading the state&#x27;s conservative Democrats, he proclaimed &quot;If we can organize the Southern States for massive resistance to this order I think that in time the rest of the country will realize that racial integration is not going to be accepted in the South.&quot; Within a month, Senator Byrd and 100 other conservative Southern politicians signed what became known as the &quot;Southern Manifesto&quot;, condemning the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions concerning racial integration in public places as violating states&#x27; rights.

Before the next school year began, the NAACP filed lawsuits to end school segregation in Norfolk, Arlington, Charlottesville and Newport News. To implement massive resistance, in 1956, the Byrd Organization-controlled Virginia General Assembly passed a series of laws known as the Stanley Plan, after Governor Thomas Bahnson Stanley. One of these laws, passed on September 21, 1956, forbade any integrated schools from receiving state funds, and authorized the governor to order closed any such school. Another of these laws established a three-member Pupil Placement Board that would determine which school a student would attend. The decisions of these Boards were based almost entirely on race. These laws also created tuition grant structures which could channel funds formerly allocated to closed schools to students so they could attend private, segregated schools of their choice. In practice, this caused the creation of &quot;segregation academies&quot;.

==History==
On January 11, 1957, U.S. district judge Walter E. Hoffman, in consolidated cases concerning Norfolk&#x27;s schools, declared the Pupil Placement Act unconstitutional. However, this decision was on appeal as the next school year started. Nonetheless, Virginians could see that President Eisenhower was willing to use the US military to enforce federal court orders to desegregate after he federalized the National Guard and sent the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce a similar decision after Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to surround Central High School in Little Rock to prevent the attendance of the black students who became known as the Little Rock Nine. In November 1957, Virginians elected Attorney General J. Lindsay Almond, another member of the Byrd Organization, to succeed Stanley as governor.

===Closed schools in Norfolk, Charlottesville, and Warren County===
Governor Almond took office on January 11, 1958, and soon matters had come to a head. Federal courts ordered public schools in Warren County, the cities of Charlottesville and Norfolk and Arlington County to integrate, but local and state officials appealed. Local authorities also tried delaying school openings that September. When they opened late in the month, Almond ordered various schools subject to federal court integration orders closed, including Warren County High School, two City of Charlottesville schools (Lane High School and Venable Elementary School), and six schools in the City of Norfolk. Warren County (Front Royal) and Charlottesville cobbled together education for their students with the help of churches and philanthropic organizations such as the American Friends Service Committee. The larger and poorer Norfolk school system had a harder time—one-third of its approximately 10,000 students did not attend any school. A group of families whose white children were locked out of the closed Norfolk schools also sued in federal court on the grounds that they were not being granted equal protection under the law, since they had no schools. Ironically, a Norfolk parochial school, Blessed Sacrament, had accepted its first black pupil in November 1953, even before &quot;Brown&quot;.

Moderate white parents throughout Virginia that fall formed local committees to Preserve our Schools, as well as conducting letter writing and petition campaigns. When Almond refused to allow Norfolk&#x27;s six previously all-white junior and senior high schools to open in September, that local parents&#x27; group was renamed the Norfolk Committee for Public Schools. In December 1958 various similar committees statewide combined under an umbrella organization called the Virginia Committee for Public Schools. Furthermore, 29 prominent businessmen met with Governor Almond in that same month and told him that massive resistance was hurting Virginia&#x27;s economy. Almond responded by calling for a &quot;Pilgrimage of Prayer&quot; on January 1, 1959.

&quot;James v. Almond&quot; was heard in November 1958, and the three-judge panel of federal district judges gave their decision on January 19, 1959, Virginia&#x27;s traditional holiday celebrating Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, declaring for the plaintiffs and ordering that the schools be opened. On the same day the Virginia Supreme Court issued &quot;Harrison v. Day&quot; and found that Governor Almond had violated the state constitution by closing schools, despite the other provision which had required segregation, and which was invalid after &quot;Brown&quot;. While the Virginia Supreme Court found that funneling local school funds through the new state agency violated another state constitutional provision, it condemned the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s Brown decision as showing lack of judicial restraint and respect for the sovereign rights of the Commonwealth and allowed the tuition grant program to continue through local authorities. Shortly thereafter, Edward R. Murrow aired a national TV documentary titled &quot;The Lost Class of &#x27;59&quot; that highlighted the Norfolk situation. Nonetheless, Norfolk&#x27;s government, led by Mayor Duckworth, attempted to prevent the schools&#x27; reopening by financial maneuvering, until the same three-judge federal panel found again for the plaintiffs.

=== Charlottesville, Virginia ===
Massive resistance in Charlottesville was prompted when Federal Judge John Paul ordered the Charlottesville School Board to end segregation commencing when schools were to open in September 1956. Twelve students, whose parents had sued for the right to transfer, were to attend two all-white schools: three Burley High School students would attend Lane High School and nine Jefferson School elementary students would attend Venable Elementary School. The students became known as &quot;The Charlottesville Twelve.&quot; The decree was received in Charlottesville on August 7, 1956. City Attorney John S. Battle indicated their intent to appeal the decree.

===Arlington loses its school board===
While campaigning in Arlington before his election, Almond had said that he favored a more flexible approach to school desegregation than Byrd&#x27;s massive resistance. In 1946, when the nearby District of Columbia schools started charging fees for black children from Arlington, the suburban city/county combination with a burgeoning population of federal civil servants had petitioned a special session of Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly for the right to hold a referendum to become the only Virginia community with an elected school board. In October 1948, the Virginia Supreme Court upheld that new board against a challenge raised by the old appointed board. However, even the new board&#x27;s policy of building and improving schools proved inadequate given the county&#x27;s financial limitations; black students were still sent to segregated and inferior schools, including Hoffman-Boston School for the small number of black middle and high school students. A federal lawsuit was initially dismissed by U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan, but in June 1950 the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had ordered the county to provide equal facilities for blacks, and equal pay for black teachers.

Arlington&#x27;s Catholic schools integrated almost immediately after &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, with no disorder or public outcry. However, when Arlington&#x27;s elected school board announced in January 1956 that it planned to begin integration in selected schools, shortly before the General Assembly met, it soon found that the state would not allow localities to determine their own positions on racial matters. The legislature dismantled Arlington&#x27;s elected public school board, instead allowing the conservative Arlington County Board to appoint school board members. This—with other aspects of massive resistance—delayed Arlington&#x27;s public school integration for years. County voters (95% white) had voted in early 1956 against the Gray Commission&#x27;s proposals, although that referendum passed statewide. However, the American Nazi Party at that time maintained its headquarters in Arlington, and it, with the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties (a segregationist group), disrupted school board meetings and distributed tracts against integration.

Arlington&#x27;s new appointed school board delayed integration, so the NAACP filed another lawsuit in May 1956 demanding desegregation, similar to lawsuits filed in three other Virginia counties. Arlingtonians also formed a Committee to Preserve Public Schools to keep their schools open against threats of massive resistance proponents. This time, Judge Bryan, on July 31, 1956, ordered Arlington&#x27;s school integrated. However, his injunction lacked teeth. He did not try to circumvent the Pupil Placement Act passed that summer, aware that not only had the Commonwealth again appealed his ruling to the Fourth Circuit (which was also considering desegregation lawsuits from Southside Virginia), the Virginia Supreme Court would soon rule on challenges to the Pupil Placement Act&#x27;s validity based on Virginia&#x27;s constitution. Meanwhile, Arlington parents hoped for peaceful desegregation, but believed strongly that northern Virginians should not lead the statewide movement of moderates, but instead jointly resolve their situation with those in Norfolk, Charlottesville and Front Royal.

After the federal and state court decisions of January 19, 1959, struck down the new Virginia mandatory closing law, Arlington integrated its Stratford Junior High School (now called H-B Woodlawn) on February 2, 1959, the same day as Norfolk integrated its schools. The Arlington County Board&#x27;s new chairman proudly called the massively prepared-for event, &quot;The Day Nothing Happened&quot;.

===Perrow Commission===
Having lost &quot;James v. Almond&quot; and &quot;Harrison v. Day&quot;, Governor Almond publicly reversed his defiant stance within a few months. The special legislative session formed a commission led by Mosby Perrow Jr. of Lynchburg, which issued a report backing acceptance of limited desegregation, leaving the burden on black parents, repealing the compulsory attendance law in favor of a &quot;school choice&quot; program and relying on the Pupil Placement Board to keep desegregation to a minimum. Almond&#x27;s legislative plan barely passed despite the Byrd Organization&#x27;s opposition. This earned Senator Byrd&#x27;s wrath, and after Almond&#x27;s term expired, Byrd tried to block Almond&#x27;s appointment as a federal judge by President John F. Kennedy, although Almond was confirmed and served on the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals from June 1963 until his death in 1986. Perrow also paid a price, for he failed to win reelection, losing to a challenger in the next Democratic primary, although Perrow later served as President of the Virginia State Board of Education.

===Prince Edward County===
Despite &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot; being one of the companion cases in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, Prince Edward County schools took even longer to desegregate. The county&#x27;s board refused to appropriate any money to operate the schools, which closed rather than comply with the federal desegregation order effective September 1, 1959. It was the only school district in the country to resort to such extreme measures. White students took advantage of state tuition vouchers to attend segregation academies (as discussed below), but black students had no educational alternatives within the county. Edward R. Murrow brought such students&#x27; plight to national attention. Finally, in 1963, Prince Edwards&#x27; schools were ordered to open, and when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the county&#x27;s appeal, supervisors gave in rather than risk prison. Then 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;, and segregationists could appeal no longer. However, when Prince Edward County&#x27;s schools opened on September 8, 1964, all but 8 of the 1500 students were black, and observers noted the difference between the black children sent elsewhere for education by the American Friends Service Committee, and those who remained unschooled through the hiatus and became the &quot;crippled generation.&quot;

During the county&#x27;s public school closure, white students could attend Prince Edward Academy, which operated as the &quot;de facto&quot; school system, enrolling K-12 students at a number of facilities throughout the county. Even after the re-opening of the public schools, the Academy remained segregated, although it briefly lost its tax-exempt status in 1978 for its discriminatory practices. White students gradually drifted back to the public schools as tuition at the Academy crept higher. In 1986, Prince Edward Academy changed its admission policies and began accepting black students, but few non-whites attend the school. Today it is known as the Fuqua School.

===Segregation academies===
Public schools in the Commonwealth&#x27;s western counties that lie outside the Black Belt, and have much smaller black populations, were integrated largely without incident in the early 1960s. By the fall of 1960, NAACP litigation had resulted in some desegregation in eleven localities, and the number of at least partially desegregated districts had slowly risen to 20 in the fall of 1961, 29 in the fall of 1962, and 55 (out of 130 school districts) in 1963. However, by 1963, only 3,700 black pupils or 1.6% of Virginia&#x27;s black student population attended integrated schools.

For example, Warren County High School re-opened as a &quot;de facto&quot; all-black school after no white students enrolled. Their parents had opted instead to send their children to the John S. Mosby Academy, one of many segregation academies — private schools opened throughout the state as part of the massive resistance plan.

Over the course of the 1960s, white students gradually returned to Warren County High School, with the Mosby Academy eventually becoming the county&#x27;s middle school.

===Freedom of Choice plans===

Multiple school systems replaced massive resistance with &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; plans, under which schools allowed families and students to opt to attend the public schools of their choice. This way, schools were able to comply with court rulings against segregation, while remaining partially or fully segregated in practice.

In New Kent County, a black parent, Calvin Green, sued the county school system to implement a more effectual desegregation scheme. This resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Green v. County School Board of New Kent County&quot; that freedom of choice plans were unconstitutional.

===Court-ordered busing: Richmond and back to Norfolk===
The Richmond City Public Schools had attempted various schemes to avoid integration, including dual attendance zones and the &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; Plan. After an unsuccessful annexation suit against Henrico County to the north, the city successfully annexed of neighboring Chesterfield County to its south on January 1, 1970 in what the federal court later determined to be an attempt to stem white flight, as well as dilute black political strength. In 1970, District Court Judge Robert Merhige Jr., ordered a desegregation busing scheme established to integrate Richmond schools. However, beginning the following school year, thousands of white students did not go to the city&#x27;s schools, but instead began attending existing and newly formed private schools and/or moving outside the city limits.

A forced consolidation of the Richmond City, Chesterfield County and Henrico County public school districts was proposed and approved by Judge Merhige in 1971, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, barring most busing schemes that made students cross county/city boundaries. Richmond City Schools then went through a series of attendance plans and magnet school programs. By 1986, Judge Merhige approved a system of essentially neighborhood schools, ending Virginia&#x27;s legal struggles with segregation.

In 1970, the Norfolk City Public Schools and several other Virginia communities were also subjected to busing schemes, also returning to more or less neighborhood school plans some years later.

Bussing plans were implemented in school districts across the north and south as well. White women, specifically mothers, who were pro-integration staunchly opposed bussing. Evidently, the racist beliefs that upheld massive resistance were not isolated in the south. Massive resistance was formed in response to legislation yet the racist motive behind the movement persisted across the country as displayed by protests against bussing plans.

==Aftermath==
Virginia experienced no incidents which required National Guard intervention. In 1969, Virginians elected Republican A. Linwood Holton Jr., who had opposed massive resistance and labeled it &quot;the state&#x27;s pernicious anti-desegregation strategy,&quot; as governor. The following year, Gov. Holton placed his children (including future Virginia First Lady Anne Holton) in Richmond&#x27;s mostly African-American public schools, to considerable publicity. He also increased the number of blacks and women employed in the state government and in 1973 created the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Schools Program. Furthermore, when Virginia revised its state constitution in 1971, it included one of the strongest provisions concerning public education of any state in the country.

In 2009, as part of their &quot;American Soil Series&quot;, the Virginia Stage Company featured &quot;Line in the Sand&quot;, a play by Chris Hannah. It reflects the emotions and tensions in Norfolk during massive resistance in both the political arena and through the eyes of the students of the &quot;Lost Class&quot;.

On July 16, 2009, the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; apologized in an editorial for its role and the role of its parent company and its sister newspaper, &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot;, in championing massive resistance to human rights, acknowledging that &quot;the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; was complicit&quot; in an &quot;unworthy cause&quot;: &quot;The record fills us with regret, which we have expressed before. Massive Resistance inflicted pain then. Memories remain painful. Editorial enthusiasm for a dreadful doctrine still affects attitudes toward the newspaper.&quot;

At the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia&#x27;s service of Repentance, Reconciliation &amp; Healing on November 2, 2013, specific mention was made of the actions of C. G. Gordon Moss, Dean of Longwood College in attempting to heal the divisions in Prince Edward County in 1963, and the retaliation he experienced. Several months earlier, the vestry of Johns Memorial Episcopal Church in Farmville, Virginia issued a similar apology during the 50th anniversary commemoration of the school closings.

Most segregation academies founded in Virginia during Massive Resistance are still thriving more than a half century later and some like Hampton Roads Academy, the Fuqua School, Nansemond-Suffolk Academy and Isle of Wight Academy continue to expand in the 21st century. Enrollment at Isle of Wight Academy now stands at approximately 650 students, the most ever enrolled at the school. In 2016 Nansemond Suffolk Academy opened a second campus, that includes an additional 22,000 square foot building for students in pre-kindergarten through grade 3. All of these schools had officially adopted non-discrimination policies and begun admitting non-white students by the end of the 1980s and like other private schools, are now eligible for federal education money through what are known as Title programs that flow through public school districts. However, few blacks can afford the high cost of tuition to send their children to these private schools. In some cases their association with &quot;old money&quot; and past discrimination still cause some tension in the community, especially among non-whites and students of the local public schools. Their racist past may cause black parents who can afford the tuition to be reluctant to enroll their children in these schools.

The abandonment of public schools by most whites in Virginia&#x27;s rural counties that lie within the Black Belt and white flight from inner cities to suburbs after the failure of &quot;Massive Resistance&quot; has ultimately led to increasingly racially and economically isolated public schools in Virginia. In total, as of 2016 there were 74,515 students in these isolated schools, including 17 percent of all black students in Virginia’s public schools and 8 percent of all Hispanic students. Many of these isolated schools are inner city schools in Richmond, Norfolk, Petersburg, Roanoke, and Newport News. In contrast, less than 1 percent of Virginia&#x27;s non-Hispanic white students attended these isolated schools.

<doc id="1290798" wikidata="Q7975689" url="?curid=1290798" title="Wax motor">
<text>A wax motor is a linear actuator device that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy by exploiting the phase-change behaviour of waxes. During melting, wax typically expands in volume by 5–20% .

A wide range of waxes can be used in wax motors, ranging from highly refined hydrocarbons to waxes extracted from vegetable matter. Specific examples include paraffin waxes in the straight-chain n-alkanes series. These melt and solidify over a well-defined and narrow temperature range.

==Design==
The principal components of a wax motor are:
*An enclosed volume of wax
*A plunger or stroke-rod to convert the thermo-hydraulic force from the wax into a useful mechanical output
*A source of heat such as:
**Electric current; typically a PTC thermistor, that heats the wax
**Solar radiation; e.g. greenhouse vents
**Combustion heat; e.g. excess heat from internal combustion engines
**Ambient heat
*A sink to reject heat energy such as:
**Convection to cooler ambient air
**Peltier effect device arranged to transfer heat energy away

When the heat source is energized, the wax block is heated and it expands, driving the plunger outwards by volume displacement. When the heat source is removed, the wax block contracts as it cools and the wax solidifies. For the plunger to withdraw, a biasing force is usually required to overcome the mechanical resistance of seals that contain the liquid wax. The biasing force is typically 20% to 30% of the operating force and often provided by a mechanical spring or gravity-fed dead weight applied externally into the wax motor .

Depending on the particular application, wax motors potentially have advantages over magnetic solenoids:
*They provide a large hydraulic force from the expansion of the wax in the order of 4000 N (corresponding to roughly 400 kg or 900 lb at standard gravity) .
*Both the application and the release of the wax motor is not instantaneous, but rather, smooth and gentle.
*Because the wax motor is a resistive load rather than an inductive load, wax motors controlled by TRIACs do not require snubber circuits.
*Wax motors can be operated entirely passively by exploiting ambient sources of energy. Given that a variety of melting-points are possible for the wax used inside the motor, one can be selected to match the range of ambient operating temperatures in a given application. In this way the wax can be melted and solidified within this range by the transfer of thermal energy. When co-located with the heat source, wax motors can be operated without the need for an additional external power source.

==Applications==
===Aerospace Controls===
Wax motors are used heavily in the aerospace industry where they are utilized to control fuel, hydraulic, and other oils critical to safe flight today in modern airplanes.

===Mixing Valves - HVAC===
Wax motors are contained inside &quot;self actuating&quot; thermostatic mixing valves, where the wax motor senses thermal change and responds accordingly to yield a desired mixed fluid temperature.

===Laundry washing machines===
Some front load washing machines use wax motors to engage the door lock assembly. When a cycle is started, a wax motor is actuated pushing a pin outward and locking the door. This design has cost, reliability and safety advantages. In moist conditions a wax motor costs less for equivalent reliability than an electromagnetic solenoid or motor latch. It has a predictable passive release delay. If power is lost the door remains briefly locked, designed to be longer than the high speed spin cycle coast-down time, then reliably unlocks as the wax cools.

===Water heating systems===
Wax motors are also commonly used to drive zone valves in hydronic (hot water) heating systems.
===Dishwashers===
They are used in many dishwashers to release the detergent dispenser door latch. The wax motor acts like a solenoid when activated by the dishwasher&#x27;s timer or control, and the piston operates the mechanism which then releases the catch for the dispenser door. They are also used to control the exhaust vent for the drying cycle.

===Greenhouse vents===
Wax motors are widely used to operate the temperature regulating vents of greenhouses.

In this application, as the ambient temperature within the greenhouse increases, the wax melts, activating the plunger and opening the vents. When the greenhouse temperature has cooled sufficiently, the wax cools and solidifies, allowing the vents to close again.

===Paraffin microactuator===
A paraffin microactuator is a type of wax motor, often fabricated by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology or sometimes precision mechanics.

<text>Charles Edward Spearman, FRS (10 September 1863 – 17 September 1945) was an English psychologist known for work in statistics, as a pioneer of factor analysis, and for Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient. He also did seminal work on models for human intelligence, including his theory that disparate cognitive test scores reflect a single general intelligence factor and coining the term &quot;g&quot; factor.

==Biography==

Spearman had an unusual background for a psychologist. In his childhood he was ambitious to follow an academic career. But first he joined the army as a regular officer of engineers in August 1883, and was promoted to captain on 8 July 1893, serving in the Munster Fusiliers. After 15 years he resigned in 1897 to study for a PhD in experimental psychology. In Britain, psychology was generally seen as a branch of philosophy and Spearman chose to study in Leipzig under Wilhelm Wundt, because it was a centre of the &quot;new psychology&quot;—one that used the scientific method instead of metaphysical speculation. As Wundt was often absent due to his multiple duties and popularity, Spearman largely worked with Felix Krueger and Wilhelm Wirth, both of whom he admired. He started in 1897, and after some interruption (he was recalled to the army during the Second Boer War, and served as a Deputy Assistant Adjutant General from February 1900) he obtained his degree in 1906. He had already published his seminal paper on the factor analysis of intelligence (1904). Spearman met and impressed the psychologist William McDougall who arranged for Spearman to replace him when he left his position at University College London. Spearman stayed at University College until he retired in 1931. Initially he was Reader and head of the small psychological laboratory. In 1911 he was promoted to the Grote professorship of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic. His title changed to Professor of Psychology in 1928 when a separate Department of Psychology was created.

When Spearman was elected to the Royal Society in 1924 the citation read: Chief amongst these achievements was the discovery of the general factor in human intelligence, and his subsequent development of a theory of &quot;g&quot; and synthesis of empirical work on ability.

Spearman was strongly influenced by the work of Francis Galton. Galton did pioneering work in psychology and developed correlation, the main statistical tool used by Spearman.

In statistics, Spearman developed rank correlation (1904), a non-parametric version of the conventional Pearson correlation, as well as both the widely used correction for attenuation (1907), and &quot;the earliest version of a &#x27;factor analysis&quot;&#x27; (Lovie &amp; Lovie, 1996, p. 81). His statistical work was not appreciated by his University College colleague Karl Pearson and there was a long feud between them.

Although Spearman achieved most recognition in his day for his statistical work, he regarded this work as subordinate to his quest for the fundamental laws of psychology, and he is now similarly renowned for both.

Charles Spearman always insisted that his work be applied in psychiatry and urged so in his Maudsley lecture to the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. While some work has been made on these lines by pupils and associates of his, the development of factor analysis as a tool of psychiatry followed a different path than he had intended. Regardless, his indirect contributions towards psychiatry were considerable.

Spearman&#x27;s life both began and ended in the city of London. He had three daughters, and a son who died in 1941 in Crete.

==Theory of intelligence==

A record of Spearman&#x27;s views on &quot;g&quot; (and also those of Godfrey Thomson and Edward Thorndike) was made in the course of the Carnegie-sponsored International Examinations Inquiry Meetings.

Here, Spearman gives a compact summary of his findings and theory of g:There was also another co-factor as proposed by Spearman that was special intelligence. The special intelligence was for individuals who accomplished high success results in the same tests. However, later Spearman introduced group factor that was particular to those correlations that were not a result of factor g or s. His ideas were in 1938 criticized on paper by psychologist Louis L. Thurstone who argued his own experiments showed that intelligence formed seven primary categories: numerical, reasoning, spatial, perceptual, memory, verbal fluency and verbal comprehension. Thurstone ultimately agreed with Spearman that there was a general factor among ability measures. Subsequently, Raymond Cattell supported a version of the general ability concept theorized by Spearman but highlighted two forms of ability, distinguished by their noegenetic properties: fluid and crystallized intelligence.

As time progressed, Spearman increasingly argued that &quot;g&quot; was not, from a psychological point of view, a single ability but composed of two very different abilities which normally worked closely together. These he called &quot;eductive&quot; ability and &quot;reproductive&quot; ability. The former term comes from the Latin root &quot;educere&quot; – which means to &quot;draw out&quot; and thus refers to the ability to make meaning out of confusion. He claimed that to understand these different abilities &quot;in their trenchant contrast, their ubiquitous cooperation, and their genetic interlinkage&quot; would, for the study of &quot;individual differences – and even cognition itself&quot; – be &quot;the very beginning of wisdom.&quot;

Despite Spearman arguing that &quot;g&quot; was what emerged from a large battery of tests, i.e., that it was not measured perfectly by any single test, the fact that g-theory suggested that much of ability could be captured in a single factor, and his suggestion that &quot;the eduction of relations and correlates&quot; underlay this general factor led to the quest for tests of this general ability. Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices might be regarded as one of these although Raven himself clearly stated that his tests should not be regarded as &quot;intelligence&quot; tests.

While arguing consistently that g accounted for much of individual differences in &quot;ability&quot; (as measured by tests which had &quot;no place in schools&quot;), Spearman also acknowledged that &quot;Every normal man, woman, and child is … a genius at something … It remains to discover at what …&quot; He thought that detecting these areas of genius required procedures very different from &quot;any of the testing procedures at present in current usage&quot;, though he felt these to be capable of &quot;vast improvement&quot;.

Spearman felt that though &quot;g&quot; could be detected in any sufficiently-broad set of cognitive measures, he felt that the tests from which his &quot;g&quot; had emerged &quot;had no place in schools&quot; because they &quot;deflected&quot; teachers&#x27;, pupils&#x27;, parents&#x27; and politicians&#x27; attention from the business of education which, as the Latin root of the word implies, should be concerned with &quot;drawing out&quot; whatever talents a student may have.

He presented a digest of his views in the entry &quot;Abilities, general and special&quot; in the 14th edition of the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;.

Spearman&#x27;s model was influential, but was also critiqued by others, such as Godfrey Thomson. In particular the move from a psychological g to a biological g – that is a unitary biological mechanism or mechanisms has remained a matter of active research. Nonetheless, Thomson&#x27;s disagreements with Spearman had more to do with methodology and epistemology than data or interpretations thereof. It was Thomson who authored Spearman&#x27;s biographical memoir for the Royal Society.

== Factor analysis ==
Factor analysis is a statistical test that is used to find relationships between multiple correlated measures and Spearman played a clear part in its development. Spearman coined the term factor analysis and used it extensively in analyzing multiple measures of cognitive performance. It was factor analytic data which led Spearman to postulate his original general and specific factor models of ability. Spearman applied mathematical procedures to psychological phenomena and moulded the outcome of his analysis into a theory – which has greatly influenced modern psychology. Factor analysis and its modern relations confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling underlie much of modern behaviour research.

<doc id="1290801" wikidata="Q1176417" url="?curid=1290801" title="David Ruffin">
<text>David Eli Ruffin (born Davis Eli Ruffin; January 18, 1941 – June 1, 1991) was an American soul singer most famous for his work as one of the lead singers of the Temptations (1964–1968) during the group&#x27;s &quot;Classic Five&quot; period as it was later known. Ruffin was the lead voice on such famous songs as &quot;My Girl&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg.&quot; He later scored two top 10 singles as a solo artist, &quot;My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)&quot; and &quot;Walk Away from Love.&quot;

Known for his unique raspy and anguished tenor vocals, Ruffin was ranked as one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2008 and again in 2023. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 for his work with the Temptations. Fellow Motown recording artist Marvin Gaye once said admiringly of Ruffin that, &quot;I heard [in his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.&quot;

==Early life==

Ruffin was born Davis Eli Ruffin on January 18, 1941, in the rural unincorporated community of Whynot, Mississippi, 15 miles southeast of Meridian. He was the third born son of Elias &quot;Eli&quot; Ruffin, a Baptist minister, and Ophelia Ruffin. His siblings were Quincy B. Ruffin, Rita Mae Ruffin, and Jimmy Lee Ruffin. Ruffin also had another sister Rosine, who died in infancy.

===Ancestry===
Ruffin&#x27;s parents were both natives of Mississippi. His father, Eli, worked as a truck driver at numerous lumber mills, and his mother, Ophelia, worked out of their home. Eli&#x27;s parents had moved from Alabama to Mississippi, because of the harsh circumstances of living after the American Civil War. Prior to living in Alabama, David Ruffin&#x27;s great-grandparents, John and Clara Ruffin, had moved from Bertie County, North Carolina. John Ruffin was a Civil War Veteran, fighting with the 14th United States Colored Heavy Artillery Regiment.

===Childhood and adolescence===
Ruffin&#x27;s father was strict and at times violently abusive. Ruffin&#x27;s mother died from complications of childbirth 10 months after he was born; and his father later married Earline, a schoolteacher, in 1942. 

As a young child, Ruffin, along with his other siblings (older brothers Quincy and Jimmy, and sister Reada Mae) traveled with their father and their stepmother as a family gospel group, opening shows for Mahalia Jackson and The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, among others. Ruffin sang in the choir at Mount Salem Methodist Church, talent shows and wherever else he could. In 1955, at age 14, Ruffin left home under the guardianship of a minister, Eddie Bush, and went to Memphis, Tennessee, with the purpose of pursuing the ministry.

At age 15, Ruffin went to Hot Springs, Arkansas, with the jazz musician Phineas Newborn, Sr. There, they played at the Fifty Grand Ballroom and Casino. Billed as Little David Bush, Ruffin continued to sing at talent shows, worked with horses at a jockey club and eventually became a member of The Dixie Nightingales. He also sang with The Soul Stirrers briefly after the departure of Johnnie Taylor. 

After some of his singing idols such as Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson had left gospel music and gone secular, Ruffin also turned in that direction. Eddie Bush and his wife, Dorothy Helen, took the then-16-year-old Ruffin to Detroit, Michigan, where his brother, Jimmy, was pursuing a career in music while simultaneously working at the Ford Motor Company.

==Career==

===Early years===
After moving to Detroit with the Bushes, Ruffin recorded his first released record with the songs &quot;You and I&quot; (1958) b/w &quot;Believe Me&quot; (1958). These songs were recorded at Vega Records and released under the name &quot;Little David Bush&quot;, using the last name of his guardian. Ruffin would later recall how he initially recorded &quot;a different kind of music&quot;, strongly influenced by the smoother pop and R&amp;B of the time, when he first recorded in Detroit for Vega.

In 1957, Ruffin met Berry Gordy Jr., then a songwriter with ambitions of running his own label. Ruffin lived with Gordy&#x27;s father, a contractor, and helped &quot;Pops&quot; Gordy do construction work on the building that would become Hitsville USA, the headquarters for Gordy&#x27;s Tamla Records (later Motown Records) label. Jimmy Ruffin would eventually be signed to Tamla&#x27;s Miracle Records label as an artist.

Ruffin also worked alongside another ambitious singer, Marvin Gaye, as an apprentice at Anna Records, a Chess-distributed label run by Gordy&#x27;s sister Gwen Gordy Fuqua and his songwriting partner Billy Davis.

Asked about Ruffin in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; in 1988, Gordy Fuqua said: &quot;He was very much a gentleman, yes ma&#x27;am and no ma&#x27;am, but the thing that really impressed me about David was that he was one of the only artists I&#x27;ve seen who rehearsed like he was on stage&quot;. According to Ruffin, both he and Gaye would pack records for Anna Records.

Ruffin created music as both the vocalist and drummer in the Voice Masters, a doo-wop style combo and eventually started recording at Anna Records, where he recorded the song &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; b/w &quot;One of These Days&quot; (1961), with the Voice Masters, a group which included future Motown producer, Lamont Dozier. Other group members included members of The Originals: Ty Hunter, CP Spencer, Hank Dixon and (Voice Masters and The Originals founder) Walter Gaines. (At one time, The Voice Masters also included another future Temptations member, Melvin Franklin, one of numerous people David would claim as a cousin). Ruffin did sign to Anna Records as a solo artist, but his work in that time was unsuccessful.

Ruffin eventually met an up-and-coming local group by the name of the Temptations. His older brother, Jimmy, went on a Motortown Revue tour with the Temptations, and he told David that they needed someone to sing tenor in their group. Ruffin shared his interest in joining the group with Otis Williams, who also lived in Detroit.

In January 1964, Ruffin became a member of the Temptations after founding member Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant was fired from the group. Ruffin&#x27;s first recording session with the group was January 9, 1964. Ruffin and his brother both auditioned to join the group, but they ultimately chose David after he performed with them on stage during the label&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party in 1963.

===With the Temptations (1964–1968)===

After joining the Temptations, the bespectacled Ruffin initially sang backgrounds while the role of lead singer mostly alternated between Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. Ruffin did sing a few lead parts, both on stage and in the studio, during his first year with the group, but his leads on these studio tracks would not be released for over a year, as they were not considered good enough to showcase his vocals. However, Smokey Robinson, who produced and co-wrote most of the Temptations&#x27; material at this point, saw Ruffin during this period as a &quot;sleeping giant&quot; in the group with a unique voice that was &quot;mellow&quot; yet &quot;gruff.&quot; Robinson thought that if he could write just the &#x27;perfect song&#x27; for Ruffin&#x27;s voice, then he could have a smash hit. The song was to be something that Ruffin could &quot;belt out&quot; yet something that was also &quot;melodic and sweet&quot;. When Robinson achieved his goal, the song, &quot;My Girl&quot;, was recorded in November 1964 and released a month later. It became the group&#x27;s first number-one single in 1965. &quot;My Girl&quot; subsequently became the Temptations&#x27; signature song, and elevated Ruffin to the role of lead singer and frontman.

The follow-ups to &quot;My Girl&quot; were also extremely successful singles, and included the Ruffin-led hits &quot;It&#x27;s Growing&quot; (1965), &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot; (1965), &quot;My Baby&quot; (1965), &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; (1966), &quot;Beauty Is Only Skin Deep&quot; (1966), &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; (1966), &quot;All I Need&quot; (1967), &quot;(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It&#x27;s You That I Need&quot; (1967), &quot;I Wish It Would Rain&quot; (1967), and &quot;I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)&quot; (1968). Ruffin also shared lead vocals on the 1967 hit single &quot;You&#x27;re My Everything&quot; with Eddie Kendricks. Standing at , Ruffin&#x27;s passionate and dramatic performances endeared him to the Temptations&#x27; audiences and fans. According to Otis Williams, Ruffin (playfully nicknamed &quot;Ruff&quot; by the group) was a natural comedian and a hard-working singer when he first joined the group.

Ruffin&#x27;s most notable non-vocal contribution to the Temptations was the masterminding of their trademark four-headed microphone stand. This enabled the other members to sing and do their dances without having to crowd around one microphone while the lead singer would sing into a separate microphone.

However, by 1967, difficulties with Ruffin became an issue for the group. He became addicted to cocaine and began missing rehearsals and performances. Refusing to travel with the other Temptations, Ruffin and his then-girlfriend, Tammi Terrell, traveled in a custom limo (with the image of his trademark black rimmed glasses painted on the door). After the Supremes had their name changed to &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot; in early 1967, Ruffin felt that he should become the focal point of the Temptations, just as Diana Ross was for her group, and began demanding that the group name be changed to &quot;David Ruffin &amp; the Temptations&quot;. This led to a number of disagreements between Ruffin and the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader, Otis Williams.
In addition to the group&#x27;s problems with Ruffin&#x27;s ego, he began inquiring into the Temptations&#x27; financial records, demanding an accounting of the group&#x27;s money. This caused friction between Ruffin and Gordy.

In June 1968, the Temptations agreed that Ruffin had finally crossed the line when he missed a June 22 Cleveland, Ohio, date with the Temptations in order to attend a performance by his new girlfriend, Barbara Gail Martin (Dean Martin&#x27;s daughter). Ruffin was fired five days later and was replaced with Dennis Edwards, a former member of the Contours, who had been a friend of Ruffin and the group as a whole beforehand. Though Ruffin himself personally encouraged Edwards to take his place, Ruffin began turning up unannounced at Temptations concerts during Edwards&#x27; first few dates with the group. When the group started to perform a Ruffin-era song such as &quot;My Girl&quot; or &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;, Ruffin would suddenly walk on to the stage, take the microphone from Edwards&#x27; hands, and steal the show, embarrassing the group but entertaining the fans. According to Edwards, the adulation and Ruffin&#x27;s pleas convinced the other four Temptations to give Ruffin a second chance, but when he arrived late to what was to be his return show with the group in Gaithersburg, Maryland, the Temptations decided to keep Edwards and drop considerations of rehiring Ruffin. However, Otis Williams has always maintained that Ruffin&#x27;s firing was permanent, and he was never considered for rehiring.

In October 1968, Ruffin filed suit against Motown Records, seeking a release from the label and an accounting of his money. Motown counter-sued to keep the singer from leaving the label and eventually the case was settled. The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown to finish out his initial contract (Ruffin joined Motown as a solo artist and always had a separate contract from the other Temptations, which some felt caused a lot of the in-fighting within the group).

=== Solo years ===
Ruffin&#x27;s first solo single was a song originally intended for the Temptations, &quot;My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)&quot;. The single (from the album also titled &quot;My Whole World Ended&quot;) was released in 1969 and reached the US Pop and R&amp;B Top Ten. This was followed by the 1969 album &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good&quot;. A third album, titled &quot;David&quot;, was recorded in 1970–71, but was shelved by Motown and did not see commercial release until 2004.

In 1970, Ruffin recorded an album with his brother Jimmy, &quot;I Am My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, for which they had minor hits with &quot;When My Love Hand (Comes Tumbling Down)&quot; and &quot;Your Love Was Worth Waiting For&quot;. Ruffin&#x27;s next official release for Motown did not arrive until 1973 when &quot;David Ruffin&quot; was released. While his solo career initially showed promise, Ruffin quickly declined as a performer due to his cocaine addiction, and Motown only giving him the bare minimum of support when it became clear that he was not nearly as popular without the Temptations behind him.

Ruffin’s final top ten hit was &quot;Walk Away from Love&quot; in 1975, produced by Van McCoy, which reached number nine on the Pop Charts. It was also Ruffin&#x27;s only entry into the UK Charts (as a solo artist), and was a hit there as well, making it into the Top Ten (peaking at number 10) in early 1976. The single sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in February 1976.

Other notable recordings from Ruffin&#x27;s solo career include &quot;I Lost Everything I&#x27;ve Ever Loved&quot; (1969); the gospel-inflected &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad I Fell For You&quot; (1970); &quot;Blood Donors Needed (Give All You Can)&quot; (1973); &quot;Common Man&quot; (1973) (which was sampled on the 2001 Jay-Z song &quot;Never Change&quot;); &quot;No Matter Where&quot; (1974); &quot;Who I Am&quot; (1975); &quot;Statue of a Fool&quot; (1975); and cover versions of the Jackson Five&#x27;s &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot; (popularized by Brook Benton)—both recorded for the shelved 1970 album; and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes&#x27; &quot;I Miss You&quot; (1973), featuring Eddie Kendricks (later Kendrick).

After leaving Motown in 1977, Ruffin recorded for Warner Bros. Records, releasing the albums &quot;So Soon We Change&quot; (1979) and &quot;Gentleman Ruffin&quot; (1980). He then signed with RCA Records and formed a duo with fellow Temptation Eddie Kendricks, who had recently departed from the group under his own set of difficulties, including the weakening power of his voice after years of chain-smoking.

=== Collaborations ===
In 1982, Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks re-joined the Temptations for the recording of their album &quot;Reunion&quot; and a tour to promote the album, which included the R&amp;B hit, &quot;Standing on the Top&quot;, that the group recorded with Rick James. However, the reunion tour was short-lived since Ruffin repeatedly failed to show up for concerts while using cocaine, leading the group to be fined thousands of dollars. Otis Williams fired Ruffin from the group for the second and final time by Christmas 1982.

Ruffin started touring with Kendricks (who dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his last name at this time) as a duo act in 1985 when he was also dismissed for his poor singing. That year, longtime Temptations fans Hall &amp; Oates teamed up with Ruffin and Kendrick to perform at the re-opening of the Apollo Theater in New York. Their performance was released as a successful live album and single. The four singers also sang a medley of Temptations hits at Live Aid on July 13, 1985. In 1985, a live medley of &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; and &quot;My Girl&quot; was released by Hall &amp; Oates featuring Ruffin and Kendrick. It reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number 40 on the R&amp;B chart. The single earned Ruffin his first and only Grammy nomination. John Oates later wrote a minor hit single for Ruffin and Kendrick, but the two duos fell out, allegedly due to Daryl Hall&#x27;s objections to Ruffin&#x27;s heavy drug use.

After being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Temptations in 1989, Ruffin, Kendrick and Dennis Edwards began touring and recording as &quot;Ruffin/Kendrick/Edwards: Former Leads of The Temptations&quot;. In 1991, they completed a successful month-long tour of England which grossed nearly $300,000. At the time of his death, they were planning a European tour. Ruffin&#x27;s final recording in his lifetime was &quot;Hurt the One You Love&quot;, which was released as a solo record for Motorcity Records.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships, children and domestic abuse ===
Ruffin was married twice. His first marriage was to Sandra Barnes in 1961, with whom he had three daughters: Cheryl, Nedra, and Kimberly. Ruffin had a son with his long-term girlfriend, Genna Sapia, whom he met in 1964. She named their son David E. Sapia, but Ruffin later changed his name to David Eli Ruffin, Jr. The three lived together for years. In 1976, Ruffin married Joy Hamilton. After his death, Sapia would add &quot;Ruffin&quot; to her last name in tribute to their relationship, and for continuity with her son. In 2003, Sapia-Ruffin published &quot;A Memoir: David Ruffin--My Temptation&quot;, which details Ruffin&#x27;s infidelity and abusive behavior.

In 1966, Ruffin began dating Tammi Terrell after she joined the Motortown Revue opening for the Temptations. They had a tumultuous relationship. Ruffin surprised her with a marriage proposal, but after Terrell announced their engagement onstage, she learned he was already married. Ruffin became increasingly violent towards Terrell as his drug abuse worsened. Terrell ended their relationship after Ruffin hit her in the head with his motorcycle helmet in 1967. Though she had migraines since childhood, Terrell told &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1969 that she believed her emotional state during this relationship was a contributing factor to her headaches. Terrell died from a brain tumor in 1970.

At the time of his death, Ruffin had been living in Philadelphia since 1989 with his girlfriend Diane Showers, who met him as a 14-year-old fan.

=== Drug addiction and legal issues ===
Ruffin first sought treatment for his drug addiction in 1967.

In 1978, Ruffin was arrested at a birthday party in Memphis. He was charged with disorderly conduct &quot;for refusing several requests&quot; to leave the area after he allegedly made threats against some policemen and their families while being transported to jail. Ruffin denied making threats and was released on his own recognizance.

In 1982, Ruffin was charged $5,000 and sentenced to six months in a low-security prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, for failing to pay taxes amounting to more than $310,000 over two years (1975–1977). He served four months and was released early for good behavior.

On May 19, 1986, Ruffin pleaded no contest to a charge of receiving and concealing stolen property worth less than $100 (a Colt .32-caliber handgun) and was fined $50 plus $100 in court costs. Charges of assault and battery and receiving stolen property worth more than $100 were dropped.

In July 1987, Ruffin spent a night in jail after he was arrested after a raid at a Detroit house. He was charged with cocaine possession with intent to distribute less than 20 grams (¾ oz) of cocaine. Ruffin was released after posting a $1,500 bond. He was found not guilty of possession, but was found guilty of using the drug. Ruffin was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and 50 days of community service. In 1989, he was ordered to enter a drug rehabilitation center after violating his probation three times. Ruffin completed a 28-day drug treatment program at the Areba Casriel Institute in New York.

==Death==
After completing a successful month-long tour of England with Kendricks and Edwards, Ruffin died on June 1, 1991, from an accidental overdose of crack cocaine; he was 50 years old. Ruffin had reportedly collapsed at a West Philadelphia crack house, where he had gone with his friend Donald Brown, according to authorities. Brown then drove Ruffin to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was declared dead at 3:55 a.m. that morning from &quot;an adverse reaction to drugs (cocaine)&quot; after emergency room personnel spent almost an hour attempting to revive him. The Associated Press reported that Ruffin and a man named William Nowell split ten vials of crack cocaine inside of Nowell&#x27;s West Philadelphia home hours before he died. Although the cause of death was ruled an accident, Ruffin&#x27;s family and friends suspected foul play, claiming that a money belt containing $40,000 was missing from his body. However, Ruffin&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Diane Showers, was not surprised when she was informed of his death. Showers stated: &quot;When David had a lot of money, he would be able to do things that he wanted to do.&quot;

In &quot;The Temptations&quot; television miniseries, Ruffin&#x27;s beaten body is depicted as being dumped in the street in front of a hospital where he dies. It was also stated in the miniseries that Ruffin&#x27;s body remained unclaimed in a morgue for a week after his death. As a result, Ruffin&#x27;s estate filed suit against NBC and other major players involved in the making of the series, claiming defamation. According to the plaintiffs in the case, Ruffin was actually taken to the hospital by a limousine and was escorted to the waiting area by his driver, who informed the attendants of his identity. Ruffin&#x27;s children further stated that his body was claimed by one of them within a few days of his death. Ruffin&#x27;s estate lost the lawsuit, and the ruling against it was upheld on appeal.

Ruffin&#x27;s funeral was held at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit. Surviving members of the Temptations sang &quot;My Girl&quot;. Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin also sang at the funeral. Michael Jackson volunteered to pay for the funeral expenses, but did not attend the service. Jackson, Rod Stewart, Daryl Hall and John Oates, Diana Ross, the Spinners, and Martha Reeves and the Vandellas sent floral arrangements.

Ruffin is buried in section three at Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit.

==Legacy==
Ruffin had many admirers among his fellow artists. &quot;Nobody could sing like David Ruffin&quot;, said his close friend and colleague Martha Reeves (of Martha and the Vandellas fame). His contemporary, label-mate, and long-time acquaintance Marvin Gaye was particularly impressed with the virility of Ruffin&#x27;s voice. Gaye said Ruffin&#x27;s work &quot;made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man.&quot;

Daryl Hall said, &quot;His voice had a certain glorious anguish that spoke to people on many emotional levels&quot;. Ruffin himself said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what kind of voice I have, I really don&#x27;t...it&#x27;s just about the feeling I get for the song&quot;.

Rod Stewart said: &quot;&#x27;I Wish It Would Rain&#x27; jumped out of the speakers and ravished my soul&quot;. Stewart would later become friends with Ruffin. &quot;His voice was so powerful—like a foghorn on the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;&quot;, Stewart told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2005.

The cover art of Ruffin&#x27;s last album, &quot;Gentleman Ruffin&quot;, was the inspiration for the art of rapper Wiz Khalifa&#x27;s mixtape &quot;Kush &amp; Orange Juice&quot;.

In 2013, David Ruffin was inducted twice into the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame at Cleveland State University. He is inducted as a solo artist and member of the Temptations. Ruffin is also inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.

In June 2019, the city of Detroit unveiled &quot;David Ruffin Avenue&quot; as the secondary street name where he formerly lived at 17385 Parkside. The ceremony was hosted by the founder LaMont Robinson of the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. It was attended by Ruffin&#x27;s family and friends including Martha Reeves and Mary Wilson.

On October 26, 2019, the city of Meridian ceremonially named a section of 8th Street near the Temple Theatre &quot;David Ruffin Boulevard.&quot; Ruffin was born in nearby rural Whynot, but claimed Meridian as home. Ruffin&#x27;s family was in attendance for honor and the unveiling of his star on Mississippi&#x27;s Arts + Entertainment Experience&#x27;s walk of fame. During the celebrations, Jackson State University&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Boom of the South&quot; marching band led a parade. Lamont Robinson, head of the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame and also Ruffin&#x27;s son-in-law, presented the idea to Meridian.

==In popular culture==

On November 1 and 2, 1998, NBC aired &quot;The Temptations&quot;, a four-hour television miniseries about the group&#x27;s career, Ruffin was portrayed by Leon Robinson, who won high praise for his performance, but Ruffin&#x27;s family was upset with the way the series portrayed him, and filed a lawsuit against the series&#x27; producers and Otis Williams, whose memoir had been the source material. The case was dismissed in favor of the defendants, with Williams later claiming that he had no real control over the presentation of the material.

Grand Puba of Brand Nubian referenced the singer on the 1990 single &quot;All for One&quot;, stating: &quot;I hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin.&quot;

Rapper Machine Gun Kelly also referenced the singer on his 2013 song &quot;See My Tears&quot; stating: &quot;Fought every temptation shit, I guess I&#x27;m David Ruffin, huh?&quot;
In 2019, rapper Lil Durk referenced David Ruffin on a song of the same name, off his mixtape &quot;Love Songs 4 the Streets 2.&quot;, with lyrics such as &quot;I know a killer who got inside that jam ... we call him David Ruffin, and they didn&#x27;t even use his statement so he sang for nothin&#x27;.&quot; (The track references Ruffin&#x27;s singing abilities metaphorically, as &quot;singing&quot; is slang in many urban neighborhoods for snitching, or telling on someone to law enforcement in order to get a lighter sentence. But, the Feds didn&#x27;t end up using his statement, so he did it all for nothing.)

In 2024, rapper Rich Homie Quan referenced David Ruffin in a song on his album, “ Forever Going In” , titled “A Way Up”, with lyrics “Ain’t nobody came to see you Otis , David Ruffin.” ( This references a scene in the Temptations Miniseries, released in 1998.)

Paul K and the Weatherman have a song on the 1996 &quot;Love is a Gas&quot; LP titled &quot;David Ruffin&#x27;s Tears&quot;.

Little Brother sampled Ruffin&#x27;s song Slow Dance for their song Slow It Down.

The first song on Fall Out Boy&#x27;s 2005 CD &quot;From Under the Cork Tree&quot; was to have been titled &quot;My Name is David Ruffin...and These are The Temptations,&quot; but for legal reasons the name was changed to &quot;Our Lawyer Made Us Change the Name of This Song So We Wouldn&#x27;t Get Sued&quot;.

Hip hop group Hotstylz used Ruffin&#x27;s song and referred his name on their single &quot;Lookin&#x27; Boy&quot;.

NLE Choppa referenced Ruffin on Polo G&#x27;s 2020 single, &quot;Go Stupid&quot; stating: &quot;Givin&#x27; niggas temptation like he David Ruffin&quot;.

American rap rock group Gym Class Heroes references Ruffin in the 2008 song &quot;Like Father, Like Son (Papa&#x27;s Song)&quot; from their album &quot;The Quilt&quot; stating: &quot;I never understood temptation. But I guess we both got a little David Ruffin in us.&quot;

Ruffin was portrayed in the Broadway musical, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud&quot;, by Ephraim Sykes.

Ruffin&#x27;s performance at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival was featured in the award-winning documentary film &quot;Summer of Soul&quot;, directed by Questlove.

<text>Anthorn Radio Station is a naval and government radio transmitting station located near Anthorn, Cumbria, England, overlooking the Solway Firth, and is operated by Babcock International (with whom former operators VT Communications are now merged). It has three transmitters: one VLF; one LF; and an eLoran transmitter.

It is on the site of the World War II military airfield which was operated by the Fleet Air Arm as HMS &quot;Nuthatch&quot;.

==RNAS Anthorn==

John Laing &amp; Son began building an airfield at Anthorn for the Fleet Air Arm in late 1943, and Royal Naval Air Station, Anthorn, was commissioned as HMS &quot;Nuthatch&quot; on 7 September 1944, with three tarmacadam runways. It was the base of No. 1 Aircraft Receipt and Despatch Unit (No. 1 ARDU), which had the job of receiving aircraft fresh from manufacturers, modifying them to Service standards and despatching them to operational squadrons, with the unit specialising in the Vought F4U Corsair, Supermarine Seafire, Fairey Barracuda and Fairey Firefly types.
No. 1 ARDU continued to operate from Anthorn following the end of the Second World War, while a number of Fleet Air Arm Squadrons were also based at the airfield in the immediate post war years. The airbase shut down in March 1958. The present road to Cardurnock runs partially along the airfield perimeter track. Several firing butts, for synchronising aircraft machine guns, can still be seen on the seaward side of the road. 

==VLF transmitter==
The VLF transmitter is used primarily for transmitting orders to submarines and transmits on 19.6 kHz with an output power of 550 kilowatts. Its callsign is GQD. VLF transmissions are relatively unaffected by atmospheric nuclear explosions and Anthorn was once part of the link between Fylingdales early warning radar, North Yorkshire, and the United States&#x27; air defence system.

A large part of the site is taken up by the VLF transmitter&#x27;s large trideco wire umbrella antenna. This consists of a central mast with 6 vertical wire radiators suspended from its top fed at the base of the mast, attached to 6 rhombic-shaped 2148 ft long horizontal multiwire toploads which radiate from the central mast at angles of 60°, supported by 12 surrounding masts, giving the antenna the shape of a 6-pointed star when seen from above. The cables supporting the endpoints of the wire antenna carry a load of 31 tons and are attached to computer controlled winches which automatically adjust the tension. The high voltage of several hundred kilovolts on the topload wires during transmission requires long strings of insulators where the wires are attached to the towers. 

It is a NATO facility, controlled from Northwood Headquarters along with three other VLF transmitters in Norway, Germany and Italy. In accordance with the procedure for NATO projects, the project was the subject of a competition among the organisation&#x27;s member countries. The British Post Office, acting as technical adviser and agent of the Ministry of Defence, chose the site, negotiated the contract and supervised the work, with the assistance of the Ministry of Public Building and Works. The contract was placed on 26 October 1961 with Continental Electronics Systems Incorporated of Dallas, Texas. This firm had already built a similar but much larger station in Maine, USA. Work began in 1962 and the station was accepted on behalf of the MoD in November 1964.

Originally, the station was designed to radiate a single telegraph channel at up to 45.5 baud and at powers ranging from 50 kW at 16 kHz to 100 kW at 20 kHz. The carrier frequency was to be stable to one part in 108 over a month. Subsequently, the data rate was increased to 50 baud and the carrier stability improved.

==LF transmitter: National Physical Laboratory time signal==
The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has installed three atomic clocks at Anthorn, and on 27 February 2007 Britain’s national time signal transmissions, retaining their original call sign of MSF, were transferred there on a trial basis, moving formally on 1 April 2007. The signals were previously transmitted from a transmitter at Rugby, administered by BT. The data transmitted includes time and date information which can be decoded using readily available software, and the signals are transmitted at an accurate frequency of 60 kHz to provide a national frequency standard. The transmitting aerial uses an auxiliary mast adjacent to the VLF array.

Monitoring and logging of the clocks and control of the transmissions is by Internet link from the NPL offices at Teddington, using comparison with GPS signals at both locations. Signal monitoring is by radio. To ensure accuracy, dynamic adjustment of the aerial according to local conditions (such as wind distortion) is controlled from computers on site. The effective radiated power is 17 kW.

==LORAN==
The general lighthouse authorities for Britain and Ireland have contracted VT Communications to develop eLoran (enhanced LORAN) radio navigational aid for mariners. The transmitter is at Anthorn. The transmitting aerial uses an auxiliary mast adjacent to the VLF array. Due to the closure of the eLoran service in Germany and Norway the eLoran service was discontinued on 31 December 2015. However, the eLoran timing signal is still active to allow for research and support purposes.

<text>In computer science, a 2–3–4 tree (also called a 2–4 tree) is a self-balancing data structure that can be used to implement dictionaries. The numbers mean a tree where every node with children (internal node) has either two, three, or four child nodes:
* a 2-node has one data element, and if internal has two child nodes;
* a 3-node has two data elements, and if internal has three child nodes;
* a 4-node has three data elements, and if internal has four child nodes;

2–3–4 trees are B-trees of order 4; like B-trees in general, they can search, insert and delete in O(log &quot;n&quot;) time. One property of a 2–3–4 tree is that all external nodes are at the same depth.

2–3–4 trees are closely related to red–black trees by interpreting red links (that is, links to red children) as internal links of 3-nodes and 4-nodes, although this correspondence is not one-to-one. Left-leaning red–black trees restrict red–black trees by forbidding nodes with a single red right child, which yields a one-to-one correspondence between left-leaning red–black trees and 2–3–4 trees.

== Properties ==
* Every node (leaf or internal) is a 2-node, 3-node or a 4-node, and holds one, two, or three data elements, respectively.
* All leaves are at the same depth (the bottom level).
* All data is kept in sorted order.

== Insertion ==
To insert a value, we start at the root of the 2–3–4 tree:
# If the current node is a 4-node:
#* Remove and save the middle value to get a 3-node.
#* Split the remaining 3-node up into a pair of 2-nodes (the now missing middle value is handled in the next step).
#* If this is the root node (which thus has no parent):
#** the middle value becomes the new root 2-node and the tree height increases by 1. Ascend into the root.
#* Otherwise, push the middle value up into the parent node. Ascend into the parent node.
# Find the child whose interval contains the value to be inserted.
# If that child is a leaf, insert the value into the child node and finish.
#* Otherwise, descend into the child and repeat from step 1.

=== Example ===
To insert the value &quot;25&quot; into this 2–3–4 tree:
* Begin at the root (10, 20) and descend towards the rightmost child (22, 24, 29). (Its interval (20, ∞) contains 25.)
* Node (22, 24, 29) is a 4-node, so its middle element 24 is pushed up into the parent node.
* The remaining 3-node (22, 29) is split into a pair of 2-nodes (22) and (29). Ascend back into the new parent (10, 20, 24).
* Descend towards the rightmost child (29). (Its interval (24, ∞) contains 25.)
* Node (29) has no leftmost child. (The child for interval (24, 29) is empty.) Stop here and insert value 25 into this node.

== Deletion ==
The simplest possibility to delete an element is to just leave the element there and mark it as &quot;deleted&quot;, adapting the previous algorithms so that deleted elements are ignored. Deleted elements can then be re-used by overwriting them when performing an insertion later. However, the drawback of this method is that the size of the tree does not decrease. If a large proportion of the elements of the tree are deleted, then the tree will become much larger than the current size of the stored elements, and the performance of other operations will be adversely affected by the deleted elements.

When this is undesirable, the following algorithm can be followed to remove a value from the 2–3–4 tree:

# Find the element to be deleted.
#* If the element is not in a leaf node, remember its location and continue searching until a leaf, which will contain the element&#x27;s successor, is reached. The successor can be either the largest key that is smaller than the one to be removed, or the smallest key that is larger than the one to be removed. It is simplest to make adjustments to the tree from the top down such that the leaf node found is not a 2-node. That way, after the swap, there will not be an empty leaf node.
#* If the element is in a 2-node leaf, just make the adjustments below.

Make the following adjustments when a 2-node – except the root node – is encountered on the way to the leaf we want to remove:

# If a sibling on either side of this node is a 3-node or a 4-node (thus having more than 1 key), perform a rotation with that sibling: 
#* The key from the other sibling closest to this node moves up to the parent key that overlooks the two nodes.
#* The parent key moves down to this node to form a 3-node.
#* The child that was originally with the rotated sibling key is now this node&#x27;s additional child.
# If the parent is a 2-node and the sibling is also a 2-node, combine all three elements to form a new 4-node and shorten the tree. (This rule can only trigger if the parent 2-node is the root, since all other 2-nodes along the way will have been modified to not be 2-nodes. This is why &quot;shorten the tree&quot; here preserves balance; this is also an important assumption for the fusion operation.)
# If the parent is a 3-node or a 4-node and all adjacent siblings are 2-nodes, do a fusion operation with the parent and an adjacent sibling:
#* The adjacent sibling and the parent key overlooking the two sibling nodes come together to form a 4-node.
#* Transfer the sibling&#x27;s children to this node.

Once the sought value is reached, it can now be placed at the removed entry&#x27;s location without a problem because we have ensured that the leaf node has more than 1 key.

Deletion in a 2–3–4 tree is O(log n), assuming transfer and fusion run in constant time (O(1)).

== Parallel operations ==
Since 2–3–4 trees are similar in structure to red–black trees, parallel algorithms for red–black trees can be applied to 2–3–4 trees as well.

<text>Ekatarina Velika (), sometimes referred to as EKV () for short, was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade, being one of the most successful and influential Yugoslav music acts.

Initially called Katarina II (), the band had built up a devoted following that greatly intensified and expanded after the death of its frontman Milan Mladenović in 1994, which caused the band to dissolve. The group&#x27;s core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenović, keyboardist Margita Stefanović and bassist Bojan Pečar, with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.

== History ==

=== Post-punk years (1982–1986) ===
====Katarina II====
In February 1982, following the disbandment of Šarlo Akrobata, 24-year-old guitarist and vocalist Milan Mladenović decided to form a new band with an old friend — 22-year-old guitarist Gagi Mihajlović. Playing music together again after being bandmates a few years earlier at Limunovo Drvo, Mladenović and Mihajlović decided to name their new band Katarina II after Mihajlović&#x27;s unrequited love — a girl named Katarina. Rounding out Katarina II&#x27;s inaugural lineup were Dušan Dejanović (another former Limunovo Drvo member) on drums and Zoran &quot;Švaba&quot; Radomirović on bass guitar. 

During late 1982, after their performance at the Topčiderska zvezda cinema, the band was joined by the 23-year-old classically trained pianist Margita Stefanović. Shortly after, the rhythm section left with Radomirović joining Du Du A and Dejanović going over to heated rivals Disciplina Kičme.

The vacant drummer position was filled by Branko &quot;Mango&quot; Kuštrin (formerly of Grupa I), but after he left within a month, Milan&#x27;s former bandmate from Šarlo Akrobata Ivan &quot;VD&quot; Vdović became the new drummer. At the same time, in early 1983, Bojan Pečar (former VIA Talas bassist) joined on bass. In spring 1983, the band took part in Zagreb Biennale, receiving positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by actor Svetislav Goncić on tin whistles. The recording sessions for the material were completed in Enco Lesić&#x27;s Druga Maca studio, however, the material was unusable due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the studio&#x27;s inferior technical equipment.

The following year, the band took the offer from fellow musician and RTV Ljubljana&#x27;s musical director Srđan Marjanović of re-recording their debut album material in the state-owned media company&#x27;s studios. Katarina II&#x27;s eponymous debut album was thus released in 1984 by RTV Ljubljana&#x27;s in-house record label ZKP RTLJ. Mostly featuring Mladenović&#x27;s lyrics, except for the Mihajlović-written tracks &quot;Vrt&quot; (&quot;The Garden&quot;) and &quot;Platforme&quot; (&quot;The Platforms&quot;), while the music was a collaboration between the two, the material was produced by Đorđe Petrović featuring guest appearances by Mario Čelik on congas and Film member Jurij &quot;Kuzma Videosex&quot; Novoselić on saxophone. Only 3,000 copies of the album were released, indicative of label&#x27;s low commercial expectations. Though it got good reviews, receiving praise for successfully linking Mladenović&#x27;s descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound on tracks like &quot;Aut&quot; (&quot;Out&quot;), &quot;Jesen&quot; (&quot;Autumn&quot;), &quot;Radostan dan&quot; (&quot;A Joyful Day&quot;), &quot;Treba da se čisti&quot; (&quot;It Ought To Be Cleaned&quot;), &quot;Ja znam&quot; (&quot;I Know&quot;), &quot;Katarina II&quot; album was not a commercial success. In a 1985 interview Mladenović complained about the album&#x27;s poor sound quality, as well as what he felt to be lack of support from the label.

Soon after their debut album, the band went through more lineup changes amid disagreements and personality clashes between Mladenović and Mihajlović. Mihajlović also ran afoul of the law — a transgression that got him a jail stint — and after serving the punishment got informed by the rest of the band he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlović claimed rights to the &quot;Katarina II&quot; name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with Vlada Divljan before moving to the United States where he has been residing ever since. Additionally, drummer Vdović left due to drug abuse problems, later joining Du Du A and the band Heroji, being replaced by the former Luna drummer Ivan &quot;Firchie&quot; Fece. The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after Catherine II of Russia, or EKV for short. Due to constant SFR Yugoslavia-wide touring, with frequent stops in Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana, and occasional TV spots, the band&#x27;s popularity had gradually grown.

====Ekatarina Velika====
In early 1985, the band recorded their second studio album at SIM studio in Zagreb. Produced by Vladimir Smolec featuring guest appearances by Massimo Savić as well as Karlowy Wary member and SIM studio co-owner Tomo in der Mühlen, &quot;Ekatarina Velika&quot; gave the band with its first bona fide hits, &quot;Oči boje meda&quot; (&quot;Honey Colored Eyes&quot;), &quot;Modro i zeleno&quot; (&quot;Indigo and Green&quot;) and &quot;Tattoo&quot;. In keeping with the theme of the &quot;Tattoo&quot; track, the album cover arranged by Dušan Gerzić features the band members painted in Native American ritual body art. After the album release on 22 March 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in Turin, Italy. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of &quot;Bolje vas našli&quot; Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange.

Towards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve his mandatory Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army service, later joining Laboratorija Zvuka, and was replaced by Ivan &quot;Raka&quot; Ranković from the band Tvrdo Srce i Velike Uši. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album &quot;S vetrom uz lice&quot; (&quot;Faced Against the Wind&quot;), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenović, Margita Stefanović and Dragan Čačinović. With the hits &quot;Budi sam na ulici&quot; (&quot;Be Alone on the Street&quot;), &quot;Ti si sav moj bol&quot; (&quot;You Are All My Anguish&quot;), &quot;Novac u rukama&quot; (&quot;Money in the Hands&quot;), and &quot;Kao da je bilo nekad&quot; (&quot;As If It Had Once Been&quot;) came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the Simple Minds.

After the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club Kulušić, made on 2 November 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album &quot;19LIVE86&quot;. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at Dom Omladine with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Ranković decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike Uši. Ranković was replaced by the actor Srđan Todorović, a former Disciplina Kičme member, as drummer, playing his first show on 9 April 1987 at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in Paris. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa award for the achievements on the second and third studio album.

=== Alternative rock years (1987–1991) ===
During the summer of 1987, the band released the album &quot;Ljubav&quot; (&quot;Love&quot;), co-produced by the band with the Australian musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist Vuk Vidor. Prominent tracks from the album include &quot;Zemlja&quot; (&quot;Earth&quot;), &quot;7 Dana&quot; (&quot;7 Days&quot;), &quot;Pored mene&quot; (&quot;Beside Me&quot;), &quot;Ljudi iz gradova&quot; (&quot;People From The Cities&quot;), and &quot;Ljubav&quot; (&quot;Love&quot;). It had also shown the first signs of Milan&#x27;s depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song &quot;Tonemo&quot; (&quot;We Are Sinking&quot;). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade&#x27;s Pionir Hall sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from Tanja Jovićević of Oktobar 1864 and Zvonimir Đukić from Van Gogh to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Srđan Todorović before moving away to New York City in May 1988.

In January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album &quot;Samo par godina za nas&quot; (&quot;Only a Few Years for Us&quot;), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by Mitar Subotić (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovićević (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include &quot;Krug&quot; (&quot;The Circle&quot;), &quot;Par godina za nas&quot; (&quot;A Few Years for Us&quot;), and &quot;Srce&quot; (&quot;Heart&quot;). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in Novi Sad, the 1990 Midem festival in Cannes and the first European rock music Bienalle held in Toulouse. After the tour, Todorović left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pečar also decided to leave the band moving to London. The new members became the former VIA Talas, D&#x27; Boys and Piloti member Miško Petrović &quot;Plavi&quot; on bass and the former U Škripcu member Marko Milivojević on drums.

The sixth studio album &quot;Dum dum&quot; (&quot;Bang Bang&quot;), released in 1991, featured the Plejboj member Dušan Petrović and session musician Bata Božanić as bass players, Tanja Jovićević on backing vocals, Zvonimir Đukić on guitar and Mitar Subotić on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs &quot;Zabranjujem&quot; (&quot;I Forbid&quot;), &quot;Idemo&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;), &quot;Dum dum&quot; (&quot;Bang Bang&quot;) and &quot;Bledo&quot; (&quot;Pale&quot;), inspired by the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars and the general political and economic situation in the country. The following year, Mladenović participated in the anti-war project Rimtutituki, also featuring Električni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, releasing the single &quot;Slušaj &#x27;vamo&quot; (&quot;Listen Up&quot;). During the anti-war protests in Belgrade, the band organized a concert on the Republic Square and also they performed anti-war songs in an open truck while circulating the Belgrade streets.

=== Mainstream rock years (1992–1994) ===
During the middle of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragiša Uskoković &quot;Ćima&quot;, with whom they recorded the final studio album &quot;Neko nas posmatra&quot; (&quot;Somebody Is Watching Us&quot;), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs &quot;Ponos&quot; (&quot;Pride&quot;), &quot;Jadransko more&quot; (&quot;The Adriatic Sea&quot;), &quot;Just Let Me Play Some Modern R&#x27;n&#x27;R Music&quot; and &quot;Zajedno&quot; (&quot;Together&quot;). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, &quot;Istina Mašina&quot; (&quot;Truth Machine&quot;), originally performed by the Yugoslav rock band Time. The album was produced by Mladenović and featured Srđan Todorović, Tanja Jovićević and a children&#x27;s choir as guest performers.

After the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, Električni Orgazam, Partibrejkers and the Zagreb band Vještice performed in Prague and Berlin on the concerts entitled &quot;Ko to tamo pjeva&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;s That Singing Over There&quot;). At the time, Mladenović and Stefanović held occasional unplugged club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist Nebojša Antonijević &quot;Anton&quot; and various jazz musicians, until Milan&#x27;s departure to Brazil, where he worked on a project called Angel&#x27;s Breath, together with Mitar Subotić and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist Goran Vejvoda, they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah Anđela (&quot;Angel&#x27;s Breath&quot;).

=== Breakup and post-breakup ===
The band resumed their activities when Mladenović returned to Serbia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled &quot;Ponovo zajedno&quot; (&quot;Together Again&quot;), but the idea was shelved because of Milan&#x27;s health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on 24 August 1994 in Budva at the Pjesma Mediterana festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had pancreatic cancer. Barely a few months later, on 5 November 1994, Milan Mladenović died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist.

Margita Stefanović continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanović, as an ambiental music duo EQV, she released the album &quot;Ti si sav moj bol&quot; (&quot;You Are All My Anguish&quot;), released by the Austrian record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the Vienna Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands Direktori, Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the Električni Orgazam unplugged live album &quot;Živo i akustično&quot; (&quot;Live and Acoustic&quot;), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights signing, she appeared in Pula with Zoran Stojanović, the leader of the Zagreb band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with Rambo Amadeus, the first Serbian musician to play in modern-day Croatia after the Yugoslav Wars.

During the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled &quot;Live &#x27;88&quot; was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulušić club, were announced by the rock critic Dražen Vrdoljak and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release. During the same year, Margita Stefanović founded the record label EKV Records and started reissuing EKV studio album with bonus material. The &quot;Ljubav&quot; reissue featured live bonus material made at the Belgrade Dom Omladine on 13 November 1991 and the 1988 Novi Sad SNP performance, &quot;Samo par godina za nas&quot; featured the live bonus tracks from the Avala fest held in September 1990 and &quot;Dum dum&quot; featured alternate and demo recordings and the 1991 Dom Omladine live tracks.

PGP RTS also contributed the CD reissuing by releasing the compilation album &quot;Kao nada, kao govor, kao more...&quot; (&quot;Like Hope, Like Speech, Like the Sea...&quot;) in 1997, featuring selected material from the latter four studio albums. During 2001 and 2002, EKV Records and IPS music reissued the rest of the band&#x27;s catalog, also featuring bonus live material. The label also released the live album &quot;Kao u snu - EKV live 1991&quot; (&quot;As If in a Dream - EKV Live 1991&quot;) featuring the Belgrade Dom Omladine 1991 performance. During the same year, a tribute album &quot;Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posvećeno Milanu Mladenoviću)&quot; (&quot;As If It Had Once Been&quot;) was released. The following year, a live tribute album &quot;Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV&quot; (&quot;A Very Good Tatto - Tribute to EKV&quot;) was released.

In 2017, Mascom Records released the double live album &quot;Krug&quot; (&quot;The Circle&quot;), featuring the recording of Mladenović&#x27;s and Stefanović&#x27;s unplugged performance held in Priština in May 1994, only half a year before Mladenović&#x27;s death.

Ivan Vdović died of AIDS on 25 September 1992 at age 31. Milan Mladenović died of pancreatic cancer on 5 November 1994 at age 36. Bojan Pečar died of a heart attack on 13 October 1998 at age 38. Dušan Dejanović died of AIDS on 16 November 2000. On 18 September 2002 Margita Stefanović died at age 43, being the fifth band member to die prematurely.

== Legacy ==
Ekatarina Velika is considered one of the top and most influential acts of the former Yugoslav rock scene. Of the bands heavily influenced by Ekatarina Velika, by far the most notable is Van Gogh, which has risen to the status of one of the most popular rock acts in Serbia in the second half of the 1990s. Another band highly inspired by EKV is the alternative rock band Block Out. The band&#x27;s work was also praised by Yugoslav rock icons like Rambo Amadeus and Dado Topić

In 2003, a tribute album to Mladenović entitled &quot;Kao da je bilo nekad... Posvećeno Milanu Mladenoviću&quot; (&quot;Like It Happened Someday... Dedicated to Milan Mladenović&quot;) was released. The album consists of 15 covers of Mladenović&#x27;s songs (14 EKV and one Šarlo Akrobata song) by a range of musicians, spanning from rock veteran Dado Topić, over EKV contemporaries like Električni Orgazam, Darko Rundek, Partibrejkers, Miško Plavi, Vlada Divljan, Del Arno Band, and Tanja Jovićević, to younger acts, like Jarboli, Darkwood Dub, Novembar, Night Shift, Block Out, and VROOM. Mladenović&#x27;s former Šarlo Akrobata bandmate Dušan Kojić also appeared on the album under the pseudonym Crni Zub, participating in the cover of &quot;Zemlja&quot;.

Another tribute album, released in 2003, was a live album &quot;Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV&quot; (&quot;Very Good Tattoo - Tribute to EKV&quot;), recorded at the tribute concert held on February 22, 2003, in Zagreb&#x27;s Tvornica club. The performers included Croatian bands Le Cinema, Vatra, and Urban &amp; 4, and solo artists Massimo Savić with EKV tribute band Veliki Bijeli Slon, Darko Rundek with his Cargo Orkestar, and Električni Orgazam frontman Srđan &quot;Gile&quot; Gojković, also with Veliki Bijeli Slon. The album consists of 13 live covers, each artist performing several.

The book &quot;YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike&quot; (&quot;YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music&quot;), published in 1998, features two albums by the band: &quot;S&#x27; vetrom uz lice&quot; (ranked No. 26) and &quot;Katarina II (album)&quot; (ranked No. 68). The list of 100 greatest Yugoslav album, published by Croatian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2015, features three Ekatarina Velika albums: &quot;S&#x27; vetrom uz lice&quot; (ranked No. 10) and &quot;Katarina II&quot; (ranked No. 29) and &quot;Ekatarina Velika&quot; (ranked No. 44). In 1987, in &quot;YU legende uživo&quot; (&quot;YU Legends Live&quot;), a special publication by &quot;Rock&quot; magazine, &quot;19LIVE86&quot; was pronounced one of 12 best Yugoslav live albums.

The Rock Express Top 100 Yugoslav Rock Songs of All Times list, published in 2000, featured five songs by Ekatarina Velika: &quot;Krug&quot; (polled No.3), &quot;Par godina za nas&quot; (polled No.11), &quot;Ti si sav moj bol&quot; (polled No.41), &quot;Zemlja&quot; (polled No.54) and &quot;7 dana&quot; (polled No.86). In November 2006, &quot;Par godina za nas&quot; was polled the Best Yugoslav Popular Music Song on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list. In 2011, the songs &quot;Krug&quot; and &quot;Par godina za nas&quot; were polled, by the listeners of Radio 202, two of 60 greatest songs released by PGP-RTB/PGP-RTS during the sixty years of the label&#x27;s existence.

The lyrics of 15 songs by the band were featured in Petar Janjatović&#x27;s book &quot;Pesme bratstva, detinjstva &amp; potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007&quot; (&quot;Songs of Brotherhood, Childhood &amp; Offspring: Anthology of Ex YU Rock Poetry 1967 - 2007&quot;).

In July 2011, the hardscape area in front of the Belgrade Youth Center was named the Milan Mladenović Place. In 2012, a street in Zagreb, Milan Mladenović&#x27;s city of birth, was named after him.

In 2016, Serbian weekly news magazine &quot;Nedeljnik&quot; pronounced Milan Mladenović one of 100 people that changed Serbia forever.

<text>Höxter () is a town in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany on the left bank of the river Weser, 52 km north of Kassel. It lies the heart of the Weser Uplands. The town itself has a population of 15,000; the district, 30,000. It is the seat of the Höxter district. Historical place names of Höxter are Hoxer and Huxaria.

== Geography ==
=== Subdivisions ===
As part of North Rhine-Westphalia&#x27;s municipal reforms, the collective municipality of Höxter came into being on 1 January 1970, formed out of the eleven communities of the former &quot;Amt&quot; of Höxter-Land, the main town, and the community of Bruchhausen from the former &quot;Amt&quot; of Beverungen. The communities in question voluntarily merged to pool their resources and bring about a unified administration. These constituent communities are:

*Albaxen
*Bosseborn
*Bödexen
*Brenkhausen
*Bruchhausen
*Fürstenau
*Godelheim
*Lüchtringen
*Lütmarsen
*Ottbergen
*Ovenhausen
*Stahle

== History ==
Höxter (Latin Huxaria) in the time of Charlemagne was a &quot;villa regia&quot;, and was the scene of a battle between his forces and the Saxons. Under the protection of the Princely Abbey of Corvey it gradually increased in prosperity, and became the chief town of the principality of Corvey. Later it asserted its independence and joined the Hanseatic League.

Höxter was located on the important long distance trade-route known as &quot;Hellweg&quot;. Rivalry with Corvey Abbey and the nearby town known as Corvey increased and in 1265, the burghers of Höxter allied themselves with the Bishop of Paderborn. Their troops destroyed the town of Corvey and damaged the abbey. The town never recovered and over the following decades reverted to a small village. This event also marked the beginning of the long period of decline of the abbey.

Höxter suffered severely during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1634, Imperial troops laid siege to the town in what became known as the &quot;Blutbad von Höxter&quot; (massacre of Höxter).

After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 it was united with Brunswick; in 1802 it passed to Nassau and in 1807 to the Kingdom of Westphalia, after the dismemberment of which, in 1814, it came into the possession of Prussia.

In 2005, an explosion within a house in the historic town centre damaged the town hall and many other significant buildings and resulted in three deaths. Work has started on the rebuilding of the damaged area but is expected to continue for many years.

=== Albaxen ===
Albaxen had its first documentary mention, under the name Albachtessen, on the occasion of the neighbouring Corvey Abbey&#x27;s founding in 822, and by 900 it was already known by its current name. The Albaxen parish church was likewise first mentioned in the 9th century. The Tonenburg, a mediaeval building complex near Albaxen – not truly a castle as the name suggests – was built in 1350 by Corvey Abbey.

=== Lüchtringen ===
In 854, Lüchtringen was first mentioned under the name Lutringi (12 different spellings, including Luhtringi and Luchtringi) in Corvey Abbey&#x27;s annals and beginning in 1230 it belonged to the fourth archdeaconate of Höxter-Corvey of the Bishopric of Paderborn. Before it became Prussian in 1813, Lüchtringen belonged to the Principality of Orange-Nassau in Fulda from 1803. In 1970, Lüchtringen lost its independence and became a constituent community of Höxter.

Lüchtringen is North Rhine-Westphalia&#x27;s easternmost community.

== Economy ==
The town&#x27;s main manufactured products are linen, cotton, cement and gutta-percha latex, and there is also a considerable shipping trade.

Höxter also has long been an important garrison town and the presence of the military continues to play a large role in the local economy.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Events ===
Regular culinary events in Höxter are &quot;Höxter Kulinarisch&quot; and the &quot;Fischer- und Flößertage&quot; (&quot;Fishermen&#x27;s and Raftsmen&#x27;s Days&quot;). At these events, gastronomy and the advertising community get together and present culinary delights.

== Attractions ==

Höxter has a medieval town hall and historic houses with high gables and carved façades from the 15th and 16th centuries. Many of the buildings in this area were damaged or destroyed by the great explosion in 2005. The most notable of the churches is the Protestant church of Saint Kilian, with a pulpit dating from 1595 and a font dating from 1631. The Weser is crossed here by a stone bridge about 150 m in length, erected in 1833.

On the Brunsberg abutting the town is an old watchtower, said to be the remains of a fortress built by Widukind&#x27;s brother Bruno.

Attractions in Höxter include:
*The half-timbered old town, built in Weser Renaissance style. Notable among these are the &quot;Adam-und-Eva-Haus&quot; on Stummrige Straße and the old &quot;Dechanei&quot; (Deacon&#x27;s House) on the marketplace, featuring over 60 carved rosettes, none of them identical.
*On Höxter&#x27;s outskirts lies &quot;Schloss Corvey&quot;, formerly Corvey Abbey, on the bank of the Weser. The abbey church has a Carolingian crypt as well as an imposing westwork. Furthermore, the poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben, who wrote &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot;, worked here as a librarian and is buried next to the church.
*As part of the &quot;Erlebniswelt Renaissance&quot; (&quot;Renaissance Adventure World&quot;), there is a town walk with the theme &quot;market&quot;, on which visitors may solve a murder case from 1617.
*The &quot;Obermühle Höxter&quot; (&quot;Höxter Upper Mill&quot;) is a former watermill that once belonged to Corvey Abbey. Today it houses the &quot;Mühlencafé&quot;.
* The Tonenburg (see History above)

== Sports ==
The largest club is the Höxter Handball and Athletics Club (HLC Höxter), which offers fitness courses, swimming, aquajogging, back gymnastics, badminton and judo. There is also the Höxter-Weserbergland Football Arena. There, on two indoor courts on artificial turf, the year round, the newest generation of football can be played.

== Government ==
=== Town council ===

The town council&#x27;s 44 seats are apportioned as follows, in accordance with municipal elections held on 30 August 2009:
*CDU 17 seats
*SPD 14 seats
*Greens 3 seats
*FDP 4 seats
*DIE LINKE 1 seat
*UWG 5 seats
=== Mayor ===
The mayor is Daniel Hartmann, independent candidate (since 2020).

=== Coat of arms ===
Höxter&#x27;s oldest known seals date from the 13th century, the same century during which the town was granted town rights. The current arms, showing an ecclesiastical structure, have been used since the 19th century, and are modelled after the second seal, known from 1285. The arms were granted once again in 1970.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Höxter is twinned with:
* Corbie, France (1963/1964)
* Sudbury, England, United Kingdom (1979/1980)

== Infrastructure ==
Höxter is served by four railway stations: Höxter Rathaus, Höxter-Ottbergen, Höxter-Lüchtringen and Höxter-Godelheim, all on the Altenbeken–Kreiensen line. The line is run by NordWestBahn who run the &quot;Egge-Bahn&quot; towards Paderborn and Holzminden. The Sollingbahn also terminates at Ottbergen, and links to Northeim in Lower Saxony.

All public transport in Höxter can be used on the integrated fare system within the Paderborn-Höxter Local Transport Association (&quot;Nahverkehrsverbund Paderborn-Höxter&quot;).

== Education ==
*Höxter is one of the four locations of the Ostwestfalen-Lippe University of Applied Sciences (&quot;Technische Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe&quot;).
*Secondary education in Höxter includes the König-Wilhelm-Gymnasium, the Hoffmann-von-Fallersleben-Realschule and the Hauptschule as well as a sales school (&quot;kaufmännische Schule&quot;, a vocational and economics Gymnasium).

<doc id="1290822" wikidata="Q1803783" url="?curid=1290822" title="List of Mexican Federal Highways">
<text>This is a list of numbered federal highways (&quot;carreteras federales&quot;) in Mexico. Federal Highways from north to south are assigned odd numbers; highways from west to east are assigned even numbers. The numbering scheme starts in the northwest of the country (in Tijuana, Baja California). The highest designation, Mexican Federal Highway 307, is assigned to roads hugging the coast of Quintana Roo and the international border in Chiapas. This list identifies the road starting point at the north or the west point of the highway and terminus at its eastern or southern point.

Motorways and roads with restricted access are considered part of the Federal Highways network and follow the same numbering schema. The letter &quot;D&quot; (for Directo) is added to the road number for all toll roads. For information on toll roads, see List of Mexican autopistas.

==List of highways==



















 


























==State highways==

Every state in Mexico builds and maintains their own state highways, which supplement the federal network. Some of these roads are unnumbered; those that have varying numbering schemes depending on the state. Shields for these roads contain the abbreviation of the state up top. State highways that are tolled, like their federal counterparts, bear a D in their designations, such as Sinaloa State Highway 1D.

<doc id="1290823" wikidata="Q201243" url="?curid=1290823" title="Slutsk">
<text>Slutsk (; ; , , Yiddish/Hebrew: סלוצק) is a town in Minsk Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Slutsk District, and is located on the Sluch River south of the capital Minsk. As of 2024, it has a population of 60,056.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the south-west of Minsk Region, north of Salihorsk.

===Climate===
==History==

Slutsk was first mentioned in writing in 1116. It was initially part of the Principality of Turov and Pinsk but in 1160 became the capital of a separate principality. From 1320–1330, it was part of the domain of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Casimir IV Jagiellon vested it with Magdeburg town rights in 1441. It was a private town, owned by the Olelkovich and Radziwiłł families, which transformed it into a center of the Polish Reformed Church with a gymnasium and a strong fortress. 

The first Jewish residents arrived by the late 16th century, expanding in population over the following centuries until the town was majority Jewish from the 19th century until World War II. In the mid-17th century, Scottish immigrants settled in the town.

Following the 17th century, the city became famous for manufacturing kontusz belts, some of the most expensive and luxurious pieces of garment of the szlachta. Because of the popularity of the cloths made here, belts worn over the żupan were often called &quot;of Slutsk&quot; despite their real place of origin.

In 1778, it became a county seat within the Nowogródek Voivodeship. Slutsk was part of the Russian Empire after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. It was occupied by Germany in 1918 and by Poland between 1919 and 1920 during Polish–Soviet War. In 1920, it was the centre of a major anti-bolshevik uprising known as the Slutsk defence action.

Until World War II and the Slutsk Affair, the city was predominantly Jewish; however, now the population includes no more than 100 Jews.

Slutsk was occupied by the German Army on 26 June 1941, and placed under the administration of Reichskommissariat Ostland. The period of German occupation ended on 30 June 1944, when troops of the 1st Belorussian Front recaptured the town during the Minsk Offensive of the Red Army.

On 2 October 1967, a riot occurred during which the local court building was set on fire, resulting in the death of a judge and a police officer. The riot, unprecedented in post-WW2 Soviet Belarus, was triggered by the conduct of a murder trial, which was perceived to be unjust by the local residents.

===Jewish community===
The first indication of Jews in Slutsk is from 1583 when the city was part of Lithuania. Formal recognition came in 1601. By 1623, Jews owned 16 homes. In 1691, Slutsk became one of the five leading communities of the Lithuanian Jewish Council. By 1750 there were 1,593 Jewish people, accounting for one third of the population. In economic life, Jewish people were concentrated in commerce; three-fourths of the town&#x27;s merchants were Jewish, and a similar share of people in the alcohol business were Jewish. After annexation by Russia in 1793, growth of the city slowed, in part due to it being bypassed by the railroad. By 1897 the Jewish community numbered 10,264 inhabitants, or 77% of the city population. They played a central role in the cities markets, particularly in agricultural produce.
Slutsk was important in terms of Torah study. Among the rabbinic figures who served there were Yehudah Leib Pohovitser, Chayim ha-Kohen Rapoport, Yosef Dov Ber Soloveichik (1865–1874), and Isser Zalman Meltzer. The famous Slutsk-Kletsk Yeshiva was founded in Slutsk in 1883 by Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky. Another outstanding scholar of learning in the Talmud and Torah who was also a Hebrew poet and became a Hebrew educator in the United States was Ephraim Eliezer Lisitzky, who was born and grew to his teens in Slutsk before emigrating to the U.S. According to legend the Baal Shem Tov visited Slutsk in 1733 at the invitation of Shmuel Ickowicz. Despite this, the town was known for its anti-hasidic misnagdim. The Haskalah and modern Jewish political parties also were represented among the population.

===Massacre of Jews===
During the German occupation of Slutsk, the Jewish inhabitants were systematically targeted for killing. The first Jewish victims were killed in the garden on Monakhov Street during the initial days immediately following the arrival of the Germans on 27 June 1941. The victims numbered between 70 and 120, according to different sources.
Four months later, on 27 and 28 October 1941, one of the largest single massacres occurred, known as the Slutsk affair, when Jews were herded towards pits in the Gorovakha ravine, approximately west of Slutsk, where they were shot. According to German sources the total number of victims was 3,400, while Soviet sources cite 8,000. These killings were carried out by two companies of the German 11th Reserve Order Police Battalion and the Lithuanian 2nd Battalion, which was a German-sponsored Schutzmannschaft or Auxiliary Police formation established in Kaunas, soon after the Nazi occupation of Lithuania.

A further massacre was carried out over several days during the spring of 1942, when the inhabitants of the &quot;field ghetto&quot; of Slutsk were taken to the forest near the village of Bezverkhovichi, west of Slutsk, where they were shot or murdered in gas vans. According to survivors, the victims were driven to the execution site in two to four trucks on Mondays and Saturdays. The last Jews of the field ghetto were murdered on the Passover, 2–3 April 1942. The total number of Jews murdered at Bezverkhovichi is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 4,000.

One of the last significant massacres of Jews occurred on 8 February 1943, with the liquidation of the &quot;town ghetto&quot; of Slutsk. The Jews were driven in trucks to the former estate of Mokhart, popularly called Mokharty, east of Slutsk, where they were shot from behind in mass graves by personnel of the Minsk security police office. During the liquidation, some Jews fought back, shooting at the German and Latvian soldiers. In response, the Germans burnt the ghetto to the ground. Postwar court proceedings cite a minimum of 1,600 victims, of which 1,200 were murdered at the graves at Mokharty, the rest in the ghetto itself.

<text>A saturable reactor in electrical engineering is a special form of inductor where the magnetic core can be deliberately saturated by a direct electric current in a control winding. Once saturated, the inductance of the saturable reactor drops dramatically. This decreases inductive reactance and allows increased flow of the alternating current (AC).

==Design considerations==
Saturable reactors provide a very simple means to remotely and proportionally control the AC through a load such as an incandescent lamp; the AC current is roughly proportional to the direct current (DC) through the control winding.

The power windings, the control winding, and the core are arranged so that the control winding is well isolated from the AC power. The AC power windings are also usually configured so that they self-cancel any AC voltage that might otherwise be induced in the control winding.

Because the required inductance to achieve dimming varies with the size of the load, saturable reactors often have multiple taps, allowing a small inductance to be used with a large load or a larger inductance to be used with a smaller load. In this way, the required magnitude of the control current can be kept roughly constant, no matter what the load.

==Obsolete technology==
Saturable reactors designed for mains (power-line) frequency are larger, heavier, and more expensive than electronic power controllers developed after the introduction of semiconductor electronic components, and have largely been replaced by thyristor dimmers using triacs or SCRs.

However, as of 2015, there has been renewed interest in using these devices for control of &quot;smart grids&quot; with multiple current tested installations in California, as well as the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1290838" wikidata="Q2981769" url="?curid=1290838" title="Bili ape">
<text>The Bili apes, or Bondo mystery apes, were names given in 2003 in sensational reports in the popular media to a purportedly new species of highly aggressive, giant ape supposedly inhabiting the wetlands and savannah around of the village of Bili in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. &quot;The apes nest on the ground like gorillas, but they have a diet and features characteristic of chimpanzees&quot;, according to a 2003 &quot;National Geographic&quot; article.

Scientists soon determined they were common chimpanzees, and part of a larger contiguous population stretching throughout that part of northern Congo. Genetic testing with non-nuclear DNA in 2003 immediately indicated that it was in fact part of the already described eastern chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii&quot;), a subspecies of the common chimpanzee.

== History ==
Skulls of gorillas were first collected near the town of Bili in 1908. These were sent to the colonial power of Belgium; in 1927, a new subspecies of gorilla, &quot;Gorilla gorilla uellensis&quot;, was described based upon these specimens. Colin Groves examined the skulls in 1970 and determined that they were indistinguishable from western gorillas.

Karl Ammann, a Swiss Kenyan photographer and anti-bushmeat campaigner, first visited the city in 1996, looking for the gorillas. Instead, Ammann bought a skull that had dimensions like that of a chimpanzee, but with a prominent sagittal crest like that of a gorilla. Ammann purchased a photograph from hunters of what looked like a very big chimpanzee. Ammann also measured a faecal dropping three times as big as normal chimpanzee dung and casts of footprints as large as or larger than a gorilla&#x27;s. 

Ammann, with a group of foreign researchers, returned in 2000 to an area described by a Cameroonian bushmeat hunter he had sent to scout the area first a few years earlier. Although they did not see any chimpanzees, they did find several well-worn ground nests, characteristic of gorillas rather than chimpanzees, in swampy river beds.

In 2001, an international team of scientists, including George Schaller and Mike Belliveau, were recruited by Karl Ammann to search for apes, but the venture came up empty.

After the Second Congo War ended in 2003, it was easier for scientists to conduct field research in the Congo. Also recruited by Ammann was Shelly Williams, an experimental psychologist affiliated with &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, who claimed to be the first scientist to see the &#x27;Bili apes&#x27;. Williams returned to the US with videos, apparently purchased from one of Ammann&#x27;s long-term trackers. Williams reported on her close encounter, &quot;we could hear them in the trees, about away, and four suddenly came rushing through the brush towards me. If this had been a mock charge they would have been screaming to intimidate us. These guys were quiet, and they were huge. They were coming in for the kill – but as soon as they saw my face they stopped and disappeared&quot;.

According to Williams, who claims she learnt Lingala, the local populace classified great apes into two distinct groups. There are the &quot;tree beaters&quot;, which disperse high into the trees to stay safe, and easily succumb to the poison arrows used by local hunters. Then there are the &quot;lion killers&quot;, which seldom climb trees, are bigger and darker, and are unaffected by the poison arrows. Other reports attribute this statement to Ammann. Williams claimed to have observed three species of chimpanzees, including this new one, during her summer tour.

&quot;The unique characteristics they exhibit just don&#x27;t fit into the other groups of apes&quot;, said Williams. The apes, she argued, could be a new species unknown to science, a new subspecies of chimpanzee, or a hybrid of the gorilla and the chimpanzee. &quot;At the very least, we have a unique, isolated chimp culture that&#x27;s unlike any that&#x27;s been studied&quot;, she said. These and other sensational pronouncements to the media proved controversial, and Williams was subsequently no longer welcome to study the animals with Ammann. Ammann had published a letter in 2003 decrying Williams&#x27; unprofessional involvement. Williams vowed to continue without him, making plans for another expedition. Cleve Hicks, a primatologist recruited by Ammann in 2004, stated &quot;genetically, they&#x27;re not even a subspecies&quot;.

Mitochondrial DNA resolved from hairs taken from the nests found in 2003 that the chimpanzees belonged to &quot;Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii&quot;. Williams countered that all these hairs may have been contaminated by real chimpanzees or humans, or that the conventional use of mDNA regions discovered in human research as genetic markers was incorrect in primatology, or that the mDNA, which is only transmitted by mothers, would not reflect one-way hybridisation with male gorillas.

In 2004, Hicks studied several communities of the chimpanzees approximately northwest of the town of Bili. Although the apes, including adult males, would surround the humans and display an interest or curiosity in them, somewhat like previous reports, they did not attack or become threatening.

In 2005, Williams was paralysed in an accident, and her claims to the media ceased. She never mounted her planned expedition.

By 2006, Hicks and colleagues had completed another long hunt for the chimpanzees during which they were able to observe the creatures a total of twenty hours. Hicks reported, &quot;I see nothing gorilla about them. The females definitely have a chimp&#x27;s sex swellings, they pant-hoot and tree-drum, and so on&quot;. DNA samples recovered from faeces also reaffirmed the classification of these apes in the chimpanzee subspecies &quot;P. t. schweinfurthii&quot;. When a report on Hicks&#x27; research on the &quot;New Scientist&quot; website was later confused with claims originating from Williams, Hicks wrote to claim the article misreported and misquoted him.

In 2019, Hicks and others published a comprehensive paper on the chimpanzees of the wider &#x27;Bili-Uéré region&#x27;, as they termed the central part of the Uélé watershed. The old giant ape controversy was ignored entirely. Twenty chimpanzee groups were studied over twelve years. In the work, Hicks &quot;et al&quot;. classifies the chimpanzees of this area as a behavioural &quot;realm&quot;, subdivided into many &quot;regions&quot;, united by common preferences and techniques, defined by tool use, dietary preferences and such habits. Chimpanzees of Bili-Uéré, for example, do not eat termites of the &quot;Macrotermes&quot; genus, which are otherwise much loved by the apes, unless the termites are having a mating swarm. Despite early reports of super-long rods used to fish termites, Hicks &quot;et al&quot;. document that these chimpanzees do &quot;not&quot; use rods to fish for termites at all, but instead bash the mounds open against roots.

== Description ==
Williams initially claimed the apes were bipedal (meaning they walk upright) and stand over tall, with the looks of a giant chimpanzee; making them look more like the extinct Australopithecine, &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot; or Toumaï.

According to Williams, &quot;They have a very flat face, a wide muzzle and their brow-ridge runs straight across and overhangs. They seem to turn grey very early in life, but instead of turning grey-black like a gorilla, they turn grey all over.&quot; They develop uniform grey fur independently of age and sex, which suggests that greying takes place early in life (whereas in all known gorilla species, only males gray as they age and graying is restricted to their backs).

A single skull from Bili has the prominent brow ridge and a sagittal crest similar to that of a gorilla, but other morphological measurements are like those of chimpanzees. Only one of the many skulls found at Bili had a sagittal crest, thus it cannot be considered typical for the population.

Female Bili apes have genital swellings similar to other chimpanzees, although Williams claimed otherwise.

=== Behavior ===
According to Williams, the apes howled at the Moon. Hicks and Ammann disputed that.

According to Hicks, in some ways, the apes behave more like gorillas than chimpanzees. For example, they build ground nests as gorillas do, using interwoven branches and/or saplings, bent down into a central bowl. However, they frequently nest in the trees as well. Often ground nests will be found beneath or in proximity to tree nests. Their diet is decidedly chimpanzee-like, consisting mainly of fruits (fruiting trees such as strangler figs are visited often).

Hicks observed one group far from the roads and villages in 2004, saying that when they encountered it, the chimps not only approached the humans, but also would actually surround them with intent curiosity. Hicks found the behavior toward humans intriguing. They would come face-to-face, stare intently, then slide away quietly. There was little to no aggression, yet no fear, either. &quot;Gorilla males will always charge when they encounter a hunter, but there were no stories like that&quot; about the chimpanzees, according to Ammann. Hicks clarifies Williams&#x27; claims as follows: the apes within roughly of the roads flee humans almost without exception. The adult males show the greatest fear. Further from the roads, however, the chimpanzees become progressively &quot;naive&quot;.

Even though these apes avoid the camera, they seem to have a curious nature. It has been observed that, when these chimps find humans around, they don’t just approach humans, but circle them out of pure curiosity. The chimpanzees would stand face to face and exchange longing glances.

== Distribution ==

Bili is a city, and a river tributary, which lies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s far north, about east of the Ebola River. It lies to the north of the Uélé River, to the south of this river lie deep tropical rainforests, whereas around Bili lie wetlands and the forests are broken by patches of savanna. Civil war and neglect had left the region relatively undeveloped and wild, with people still using home-made guns of ancient design in 2005.

Chimpanzees were also tracked by Ammann in the region near the city of Bondo, to the west, in 2004.

In 2006, Hicks moved the study to the much denser forests around Gangu, and from the road to Bili. By 2007 they had grown frightened of the new arrivals to the city of Bili as gold was found in the region, and moved south of the Uélé. In 2007, Hicks was based in the city of Aketi, a few hundred kilometres southwest of Bondo.

As of 2014, a large contiguous population of chimpanzees is now known to occur in the lands along both sides of the Uélé throughout Bas-Uélé District, in a range of habitats. They can be found throughout the region, in the savannahs around Bili and the dense rainforests a few hundred kilometres south. They are adapted to humans and occur within of Bili, as well as other neighbouring towns such as Lebo and Zapay, and within of large cities such as Buta.

== Conservation ==
Primates throughout the Congo are hunted for bushmeat, although less to the north of the Uélé. Beginning in 2007 the Bili area saw an influx of gold miners, prompting concern by Westerners about the animals in the area. Over a 14-month period between September 2007 and November 2008, Hicks and his associates documented 34 chimpanzee young and 31 carcasses for sale in the cities of Buta, Aketi and Bambesa.

<doc id="1290844" wikidata="Q847764" url="?curid=1290844" title="Tequila, Jalisco">
<text>Santiago de Tequila (; &quot;place of tribute&quot;) is a Mexican town and municipality located in the state of Jalisco about 60 km from the city of Guadalajara. Tequila is best known as being the birthplace of the drink that bears its name, &quot;tequila,&quot; which is made from the blue agave plant, native to this area. The heart of the plant contains natural sugars and was traditionally used to make a fermented drink. After the Spanish arrived, they took this fermented beverage and distilled it, producing the tequila known today. The popularity of the drink and the history behind it has made the town and the area surrounding it a World Heritage Site. It was also named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; (Magical Town) in 2003 by the Mexican federal government. 

The coat of arms of the municipality was officially adopted on 31 December 1983 by the municipal council. It contains the Latin phrase ALMA LAETA NOBILIS, meaning &quot;cheerful and noble soul&quot;. Its representative symbols include the tower of the main church in the town of Tequila, the chimneys of the distilleries, the agave plant and Tequila Mountain.

==History==
The first peoples to live in this area were probably the people from the shaft tomb culture during the Middle Formative Period. By the Late Formative and Classic period, the Teuchitlan tradition entered the region. Several guachimonton complexes were built nearby such as Huitzilapa to the west and Amatitan to the east. The Epiclassic saw an intrusion of peoples from the Bajio region during a period of intense drought bringing with them many Central Mexican characteristics. By the Postclassic a variety of ethnic identities were in the region such as Caxcan, Cora, and Huichol. The major pre-Hispanic settlement was not where the town of Tequila is today, but rather in a place called Teochtinchán. After the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish moved west and this region became part of what was known as Nueva Galicia during the colonial period. Initial resistance to Spanish domination was brief. Local people fortified their major town, but in the end decided to surrender peacefully.

The village of Santiago de Tequila was founded in 1530 by Franciscan friars, who moved many of the local people here from Chiquihuitillo Mountain (now known as Tequila Volcano). In 1541, indigenous people in various parts of Nueva Galicia revolted against Spanish rule. Locally, The Tecoxines and Caxcanes in the towns of Tlaltenango, Xochipila, Nochictlán and Teocaltech rebelled first, with those in Tequila joining later. These rebels made their stand on Tequila Mountain. Friar Juan Calero of the monastery near Tequila went to try and pacify the situation, but he was killed by a barrage of arrows and rocks. His body was stripped of its robes and hung on the local stone idol. Another monk who died trying to negotiate a settlement was Friar Antonio de Cuellar of the Etzatlan monastery. In October 1541, the situation in Nueva Galicia was so serious that the viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, arrived from Mexico City. Rebel chief Diego Zacatecas went to meet with the viceroy, but was immediately taken prisoner by the Spanish. The price for his release was the end of the rebellion and for the chief to convert to Christianity.

In 1600, Pedro Sánchez de Tagle decided to build a large scale distilling operation based on a local fermented beverage made with the local agave plant. He also introduced the idea of cultivating this plant, native to the region, on a mass scale.

At the beginning of the 19th century came another rebellion in the Tequila area, this time led by a man only known as &quot;The Gold Mask&quot;. This rebellion was suppressed by the governor of Nueva Galicia, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, for which he was subsequently promoted to viceroy of Peru.

Shortly after this came the Mexican War of Independence. Rafael Pérez, under orders from José María Mercado, came to Tequila with 200 men to take over the town from royalist forces. After Independence, the town to Tequila was made the seat of one of the departments of the new state of Jalisco. When these departments were reorganized into municipalities, the town of Tequila was made the seat of the municipality of the same name. In 1874, the town of Tequila was given the official status of city. This was in recognition of an event in 1873, when Sixto Gorjón, about 50 police and citizens of Tequila fought off a group of bandits headed by Manuel Lozada, known as &quot;The Tiger of Alicia&quot;.

==The town==

The town of Tequila had a population of 26,809 (2010 census), accounting for about 73% of the municipality&#x27;s inhabitants. It contains the main parish church, Our Lady of the Purísima Concepción, built in the 18th century by Martín Casillas. The church has a stone facade, a bell tower and inverted truncated pyramid (estipite) pilasters that flank the main portal. The portal has two levels and a crown. The first level contains the door arch with has moulding and a seal and is supported by two Doric columns. The upper portion contains a window with moulding with Doric columns in each side, decorated with curves and vegetable motifs. The crown at the top contains a sculpture of the Archangel Michael in a niche flanked by Doric columns. The side portal is an arched entrance with Tuscan columns and cornice and a cross in relief at the midpoint. Inside are one nave and a Neoclassical main altar. Also inside is a statue of Our Lady of the Conception that dates from 1865.

Notable secular structures include the Quinta Sauza, built in the 1830s, and the La Perserverancia distillery, which was built in 1873. The Quinta Sauza has a large exterior garden with elaborate stone fountains. In the atrium, there are carvings with scenes from the passion of Christ. The facade of the house has reliefs of plants in which there are several entrances. Inside, there is a courtyard with a decorated fountain in the center and the entrance to the chapel in the back, which is decorated with plant and serpent motifs. In La Perseverancisa there is a huge work painted by Gabriel Flores in 1969 depicting the making and drinking of tequila. The distillery has guided tours. This distillery also has a museum in front of the municipal palace, containing paintings, photographs, sculptures and the machinery of the La Perservancia distillery and a room dedicated to regional crafts.

The National Museum of Tequila (MUNAT) is located in the town of Tequila on land that was purchased and set aside by Cipriano Rosales at the beginning of the 20th century for cultural and/or educational activities. The Eduardo González Primary School was established first in 1933 and became a vocational high school in 1979. This was closed in the 1980s due to the deterioration of the building. After extensive remodeling, it reopened as the Casa de Cultura Tequilense (Tequila Cultural Center) and remained so until 2000, when it was converted into the National Museum of Tequila. It is the first museum in the world dedicated to this liquor.

Just10 km outside the town of Tequila proper is the Sanctuary of Saint Toribio Romo González on the road that leads to the Balneario La Toma, in a community called Agua Caliente. Toribio Romo was recently canonized by John Paul II. The Sanctuary is located in the place where Saint Toribio, as in commonly known was apprehended and shot during the Cristero War.

The National Festival of Tequila is held every year from the end of November to the middle of December. During this event, a Tequila Queen is crowned and the main distillers in the area all have a presence with samples of their tequila. There are also charreada events and a parade with floats, cockfights, mariachis, fireworks and rides. This festival coincides with the feast of Tequila&#x27;s patron saint, Our Lady of the Purisíma Concepción.

A surprising tradition for those not from Tequila is the nightly blessing of the town by the parish priest. At 9pm every night, the priest offers blessings by ringing a bell three times, and directing the holy of holyest cross with the sacraments towards all 4 cardinal points. At this moment, everyone in the town stops what they are doing, including turning off things like the television or radio and stands for the blessing.

==The town and the beverage==

The beverage called tequila is really a variety of mezcal, made wholly or mostly from the blue agave plant. This plant is native to the Tequila area so this version of mescal was named after the town. Use of the agave plant goes far back into the pre-Hispanic period. Traditionally, it was cultivated to combat soil erosion, used as an element in house construction, in the production of cleaning products, and more. The &quot;piña&quot; (lit. pineapple) or heart of the plant was used by the indigenous peoples cooked as a sweet, and as the base for a fermented alcoholic beverage. This beverage was called mescal by the native people and was much like what is called pulque today. By the time the Spanish arrived, the natives had already been cultivating the plant. The Spanish first considered taking the plant back to Spain but decided to develop it and its product in Mexico.

The Spanish introduced distillation to turn the native fermented mescal into what is now known as tequila. The original mescal was already a well-known drink that was sold in towns regularly, and when the Spanish discovered this they used it as the source product for distillation. It was an excellent product because by 1546, soldiers were obliged to mix their water with these agave alcohols, as drinking water was often contaminated. Drinks made from Agave plants rose in popularity very quickly. Agave products were prized to the extent that they were objects of trade over considerable distances, for example, from Arizona’s Grand Canyon as much as 450 km eastward to consumers on the Colorado Plateau. 

The first large-scale distillery was created in 1600 and over the colonial period demand for the drink resulted in some of the oldest, still-operating enterprises in this area such as: &quot;La Rojeña&quot;, founded in 1795; &quot;El Tigre&quot; (now La Constancia) founded in 1823; Destiladora de Occidente (now &quot;Tequila D’Reyes&quot;) founded in 1840; La Perseverancia (now Tequila Sauza) founded in 1873; El Llano (now Tequila Azteca) founded in 1876; La Mexicana (now Tequila Orendain) founded 1879.

The progress of tequila as a national drink was not without several &quot;booms&quot; and fall-backs. The initial boom on a global scale that would promote the drink further was when the drink began to captivate the European palette. Mexicans going to Europe discovered that their national drink was famous there, and upon returning they would drink it and promote it in their social circles. In this way we see the globalization process, and the progress of the drink as a symbol of identity for the region. Further, in 1873, the &quot;Mezcal wine&quot; (a former name used when referring to Tequila the drink) from the region of Jalisco was officially named &quot;Tequila&quot;, in order to distinguish it from Mezcal spirits produced in the south of Mexico, such as those produced in Oaxaca.

The name &quot;Tequila&quot; has been protected by the Mexican government since 1974, and its use is limited to products distilled from agave grown in certain regions of Mexico. These regions are in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Guanajuato, and parts of the State of Tamaulipas. The lands in Tamaulipas were added later as the need to cultivate blue agave grew, and these lands and the agave grown on them were certified by the Mexican government for quality. The term is also limited to fifteen production facilities such as Tequila Sauza, Tequila Orendaín, and Jorge Salles Cuervo.

Long-established distilleries here produce between 500 and 1000 liters a day but this is not enough to meet the international demand for the product, which has skyrocketed since the 1980s. The number of brands of tequila have also increased exponentially, since the incorporation of national and international investors, politicians, entrepreneurs, distribution intermediaries, marketers, among others, have made their appearance interested in participating in the mezcal market. The popularity of the drink has led to the attraction of thousands of visitors to the area each year to see the fields, distilleries, Museo Nacional de Tequila (The National Museum of Tequila), the Barraca de Tequila and to ride the &quot;Tequila Express&quot;, which is a train that runs from Guadalajara to tequila country, arriving at the Tequila railway station. The train has 4 cars with a capacity of 68 people and usually requires that tickets be bought a month in advance.

==World Heritage Site==
The history and culture behind tequila production has led to the town of Tequila and the vast agave fields surrounding it to be declared a World Heritage Site. It encompasses 35,019 hectares between the foothills of the Tequila Volcano and the valley of the Rio Grande de Santiago, which is covered in fields of blue agave. For over 2,000 years, this plant has been used to make fermented drinks and cloth and since the 16th century has been used to make the distilled liquor with the name of Tequila. Both the drink and the culture associated with making it has become absorbed into Mexican identity. Within these fields are the towns of Tequila, Arenal, Amatitan and Teuchitlán with large tequila production facilities. This site contains an inventory of fields, distilleries and factories (active and inactive) as well as &quot;tabernas&quot; (illegal tequila facilities during the Colonial period), the towns and the Teuchitlán archeological sites. Many of the tequila-making facilities are located on large haciendas that date back as far as the 18th century. Most distilleries and haciendas are made of brick and adobe, featuring stucco walls with an ochre lime-wash, stone arches, quoins and window frames. Most are decorated with Neoclassical or Baroque ornamentation. The production of tequila represents the fusion of the pre-Hispanic tradition of making alcohol with agave with European distilling techniques. The Teuchitlán archeological site is of one of the first cultures here that first produced an agricultural society here.

==Tequila tourism==
The Tequila Route as a tourist destination was created in 2006 and the Tequila Express were created with the aim of promoting the tourism of Tequila into the neighboring municipalities of El Arenal, Amatitán, Magdalena and Teuchitlan, which also contain important tequila facilities, as well as cultural and archeological attractions. Both also go through the vast blue agave fields that were recently named a World Heritage Site. The Tequila Route was created and is supervised by the Consejo Regulador del Tequila, which regulates the production and authenticity of the liquor produced here. Other attractions on the route include archeological sites, old mansions and opal and obsidian mines. The archeological sites primarily belong to a culture known as the Guachimontones located in the municipalities of Teuchitlan and Magdalena. In a number of the old hacienda/distilleries, visitors are invited to try their hand at some of the aspects of tequila making, such as cutting the spines off the agave plant. Most of these haciendas also have tasting rooms and restaurants. Along the route is the Tequila Volcano.

The Tequila Express is a train for tourists that has been in operation since 1997. On Saturdays and Sundays this train takes passengers through tequila country, accompanied by live mariachi music and bilingual guides to the Hacienda San José del Refugio. Another guided tour is Tequila Adventure, which shuttle people in vans to the distilleries of la Cofradía and Mundo Cuervo.

The Mexican National Tequila Fair is held every year from 30 November to 12 December. It includes parades, charreadas (Mexican rodeos), cock fights, serenades with mariachis, and firework displays.

Tequila has also been famous for being the prime setting in the Televisa telenovela &quot;Destilando Amor&quot;, starring Angélica Rivera and Eduardo Yáñez.

==Geography==
Tequila is one of the 124 municipalities of Jalisco, located just west of the center of the state. Its territory extends for 1689.11km2, with elevations that vary between 700 and 2,900 meters above sea level. The municipality borders with the main metropolitan region of Guadalajara to the east (Zapopan), and the State of Zacatecas to the north. All of the neighboring municipalities surrounding Mount Tequila conform the greater region of &#x27;Tequila&#x27;. These include the adjacent municipalities of Amatitlán, Magdalena, San Juanito de Escobedo, San Martín de Bolaños, San Cristóbal de la Barranca, Hostotipaquillo and, south of Tequila Volcano: Teuchtilán and Ahualulco de Mercado. The original land-subdivision of the region was delineated by the Agave-growing haciendas that are found throughout.

After Independence, the state of Jalisco was originally divided into 26 departments, with Tequila being one of the seats of these departments. After modern municipalities were created, Tequila remained a seat, but of the municipality that bears its name. This municipality contains 207 communities with the most populous (outside of the town of Tequila) being El Salvador, San Martín de las Cañas, Santa Teresa and Potrero de la Rivera aside from the municipal seat. The total population of the municipality is 38,534, 73% of which lives in the municipal seat of Tequila.

The municipality is located on rugged terrain with little flat space except in some valleys. The Santiago y Chico River constitutes the low points of the municipality at 700 meters while the high peaks are located in the south. The highest mountain is Tequila Volcano or Tequila Mountain at 2,900 meters. This as an inactive volcano, not having had an eruption in more than 220,000 years, and dominates the landscape in the center of the municipality. Hiking and other ecotourism is possible here but infrastructure such as roads, security and signs are minimal. The eastern part of the municipality is dominated by the Sierra de los Balcones.

===Climate===
Tequila has a tropical savanna climate with some semi-arid influences. It has a dry season in the winter and spring and a rainy season in summer and fall. Temperatures do not vary greatly between summer and winter and average about 22.7 C. The higher elevations have pine and oak forest while the lower elevations have mesquite, nopal, and other vegetation. The municipality has 28,430 hectares of mostly pine forest in the higher mountain areas. The major rivers of the municipality are the Santiago, El Chico and Bolaños and a large number of small streams.


Most of the municipality&#x27;s economy is still based on agriculture, employing about 47% of its people. Despite the very visible growing of the blue agave plant, most acres here are still devoted to corn. Other crops include sorghum, beans, mangos, oranges, avocados and squash. Livestock includes beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs, goats, horses, fowl and bees. The making of tequila employs about 25% of the municipality&#x27;s population, but brings in the most money. It accounts for almost all the municipality&#x27;s industrial base. Tourism, such as that related to tequila and ecotourism sites are a growing part of the economy. One example of ecotourism here is the Balneario La Toma, which is located on very rugged terrain with cliffs, promoting rappelling, paragliding and other similar sports. There is some mining here, mostly of opals, gold and silver.

==Sister cities==
Tequila maintains sister city relations with Cathedral City, California, which is located in the Coachella Valley of Southern California. Tequila Council members, business promoters, and Rotary Club officials have attended many celebrations hosted by the California city, including the Tequila Festival, held in 1998, which highlighted the arts, culture, and products of Tequila, Jalisco. The city of Cathedral City has since renewed an annual tradition of celebrating the twenty year anniversary of sister city, which in 2016 happened to coincide with the 35th anniversary of incorporation of Cathedral City. The Taste of Jalisco Festival was held in downtown, the second year honoring the culture, music, and food of the city&#x27;s diverse Mexican heritage.

Other sister cities include Jelenia Góra, Poland.

<text>Cumulus Media, Inc. is a broadcasting company of the United States and is the second largest owner and operator of AM and FM radio stations in the United States ahead of Audacy and behind iHeartMedia. As of June 2019, Cumulus lists ownership of 428 stations in 87 media markets. It also owns and operates Westwood One. Its headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Its subsidiaries include Cumulus Broadcasting LLC, Cumulus Licensing LLC and Broadcast Software International Inc.

==History==
===Origins===
Cumulus Media was established in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other legislation, relaxed media ownership restrictions, allowing a single owner to possess or control an unprecedented number of radio stations per market and nationwide. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Weening signed onto Dickey&#x27;s idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets as opposed to the largest markets on which competing radio group Clear Channel Communications was focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was president of both radio consulting firm Stratford Research and his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting, with two stations in Toledo, Ohio; these stations would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of Quaestus &amp; Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology startups. For the new radio company, Weening chose the name Cumulus for the type of cloud formation for their ubiquity in the sky, which Weening and Dickey hoped would be the same for their stations across the country. Quaestus provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus business strategy.

The next significant milestone was obtaining a $50 million investment from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which previously invested in Weening&#x27;s magazine publishing company. With this capital in place, Cumulus began full-scale operations on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance, and internet from the company&#x27;s original headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive vice-chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus Broadcasting from new offices in Chicago&#x27;s Hancock Center. Having a reputation as an advertising sales leader, Bungeroth oversaw market-level tactical execution, including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, brother of Lewis and himself an experienced radio programming consultant. would oversee station content.

SWIB&#x27;s investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. With this financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening began acquiring radio stations yet managed to stay &quot;under the radar&quot;, not attracting much notice or competition. In its first 12 months in operation, Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets. Soon it was clear that the company would need over a billion dollars for its desired acquisitions, and an initial public offering of stock was soon made.

The Cumulus strategy, as articulated in public filings, was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming. Each station would be programmed with a unique music format, live programming, brand, and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time of Cumulus&#x27; founding, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers, Cumulus could gain a greater share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner separately. In addition, acquiring the top-performing stations in a given market as part of the operating cluster would yield more national advertising. The market focus would be on those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities, while the station focus was the leading station in the market and other stations well-positioned for significant growth.

===Initial public offering and accelerating acquisitions===
Cumulus became a publicly traded company on June 26, 1998. The company raised $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00 each, $125 million in preferred stock, and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations – 124 FM stations and 52 am stations in 34 U.S. markets. In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid-size market radio conglomerate. Following the company&#x27;s IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 per share on October 2, 1998 before beginning a climb to close 1999 at $50.75. Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.

For 1998, Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999, Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.

On November 19, 1999, Cumulus sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93, raising $250 million. Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point, the company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 markets. In a period of two years and six months, Cumulus became the second largest U.S. broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. It also raised a staggering $1.3 billion when considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit, and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.

The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a share price that rose to a high of $51.00 on December 31, 1999.

===Challenges in 2000===
Cumulus was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and was impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by both the absence of earnings and rumors which suggested the rapid growth might be false.

The first quarter of 2000 proved to be troubling at Cumulus. A perfect storm of events drove the company&#x27;s share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.

On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation. Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says &quot;roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus&#x27; revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company&#x27;s auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus&#x27; financial controls arising from the possible revenue restatements.

Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.

During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey&#x27;s 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.

As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the company&#x27;s ability to finance pending acquisitions.

===Internet debate===
Since November 1998 the company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects. Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 1990s had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform. Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.

===Changing of the guard===
According to interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board&#x27;s decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening&#x27;s ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001. According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.

The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary G Berner.

In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging &quot;antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims&quot;, similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff. In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.

In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to &quot;pursue other interests&quot; after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot. It had previously been reported in April 2016 that Cumulus was &quot;going to great lengths to keep two of its executives on board&quot; and that Hannan had been offered &quot;a big bonus to stay&quot; as incentive to remain with the company. In October 2016, it was announced Hannan had taken the role of chief financial officer at programmatic advertising company, Social Reality, Inc. [NASDAQ: SRAX]. Per SEC filings, Hannan would also &quot;assist the company for several months to ensure a smooth transition&quot;. Noble Financial Analyst Michael Kupinski was reported to say that the resignation of CFO JP Hannan for John Abbot was &quot;not a good sign&quot; for the company and as a result of the change, a restructuring was likely.

===Chapter 11 bankruptcy===
On November 29, 2017, Cumulus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring of the company. Cumulus exited bankruptcy on June 4, 2018.

===Response to 2020 election fraud claims ===
On January 6, 2021, in response to attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election and the U.S. Capitol attack, Cumulus Media executives directed its on-air personalities to stop spreading misinformation about unsubstantiated claims of Biden stealing the election or face termination.

===Chairman, president and chief executive officer===
By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)

In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company&#x27;s quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them. On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011. As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.

In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.

In July 2007, the company announced its intention to &quot;go private&quot;, however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.

Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses – $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.

The company&#x27;s stock, priced over $56 in 1999, then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.

===Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global===
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy. In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in &quot;exclusive negotiations&quot; to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale. On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States; it included the stations that made up the former ABC Radio group (like flagship stations KABC-AM, WLS-AM and WABC-AM). The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel&#x27;s shareholders. As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits. Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.

On August 29, 2013, it was reported by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting&#x27;s Fresno cluster. The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.

===Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships===
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company&#x27;s properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the &quot;Nash Bash&quot;. All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.

In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.

On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service. However, in November 2015, Rdio filed for bankruptcy and sold its assets to Pandora Radio.

==Criticism and controversies==
===COVID-19 vaccine mandate controversy===

On August 11, 2021, in a company town hall Zoom meeting, Cumulus Media CEO Mary Berner announced a company wide COVID-19 vaccine mandate. She stated that employees must be fully vaccinated by September 27, 2021. Cumulus made no public comment. Unvaccinated employees had their employment terminated on October 11, 2021. Terminated employees were denied unemployment benefits. It was reported that most exemption claims were being rejected. The rejections were reported to use boilerplate messages. On October 18, 2021, political commentator, radio show host, and author Dan Bongino, rallied against the company&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, and threatened to quit over the mandate. He described their mandate as unethical, immoral, and antithetical. Giving Cumulus an ultimatum, he said &quot;You can have me or you can have the mandate. But you can&#x27;t have both of us.&quot; Cumulus declined to comment. Bongino&#x27;s team says that he has been vaccinated against COVID-19 upon the advice of his doctors because he has Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

On May 9, 2023, former News/Talk 98.9 WKIM Memphis morning show co-host Bob Boccia, who has Crohn&#x27;s disease, sued Cumulus Media after failing to accommodate his medical condition and religious beliefs. His suit details violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as breach of contract. He is the first former Cumulus employee to sue the company for its vaccine mandate. On December 1, 2023, former 107.5 The Game in South Carolina sports talk radio host Tim Hill filed a civil rights lawsuit against Cumulus for firing him back in 2021 over their vaccine mandate. Hill is claiming a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, making him the second former Cumulus host to sue the company over this vaccine mandate.

On April 3, 2024, it was reported by InsiderRadio.com that CEO Mary Berner would likely be on the witness list in a suit against Cumulus Media over their vaccine mandate. Chief Human Resources Officer Todd McCarty would have also been on the witness list because he is the one who denied Hill’s request for a religious accommodation. McCarty denied all exemptions. In June 2024, McCarty stepped down from his position.

===401(k) lawsuit===
On February 15, 2023, Cumulus Media paid &quot;$1 million to settle a lawsuit filed by seven former employees who said the fee practices and investment selections of the company&#x27;s 401(k) plan violated ERISA.&quot;

=== Noncompete lawsuit ===
In August 2023, Cumulus-owned Susquehanna Radio sued two former employees of Dallas, Texas-based radio station KTCK 1310 The Ticket, Dan McDowell and Jake Kemp, seeking to impose a temporary restraining order (TRO) on them after they refused to comply with a cease and desist order, in which the company claimed that production of &quot;The Dumb Zone&quot; podcast by the two former radio hosts violated the noncompete agreements in their contracts barring them from competing with their former employer. In September 2023, the case was resolved after US District Judge Karen Gren Scholer ruled that Susquehanna had failed to meet the &quot;burden of persuasion&quot; to have a TRO granted and the podcast was allowed to resume production.

==FCC actions==
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. According to the FCC, Cumulus failed to comply with record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules regarding information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.

In January 2016, the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Enforcement Bureau reached a &quot;record-setting&quot; $540,000 settlement with Cumulus over sponsorship identification in radio ads promoting a proposed energy project, reported to be the largest payment in FCC history for a single-station violation of the Commission&#x27;s sponsorship ID laws. In August 2019, the FCC proposed Cumulus Media pay another $233,000 fine for additional violations of its sponsorship identification rules and not reporting them to the FCC after agreeing to do so under its 2016 consent decree.

==Restatements==
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three-quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.

On November 8, 2005, the company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.

<text>The Ionosonde Juliusruh is a facility of the institute for atmospheric physics near Juliusruh in northeastern Germany for sounding the ionosphere with radar systems in the short wave range (frequencies between 1 MHz and 30 MHz). The landmark of the station is a 70 metre high grounded free standing steel framework tower, which was built in 1960/61 and which carries a cage aerial for the transmitter of the ionosonde.

<doc id="1290855" wikidata="Q240456" url="?curid=1290855" title="Savo Milošević">
<text>Savo Milošević (, ; born 2 September 1973) is a Serbian professional football manager, currently of Persian Gulf Pro League side Nassaji Mazandaran, and former player.

A former forward, he signed for English club Aston Villa after making a name for himself at Partizan. He would go on to spend the vast majority of his career in Spain, where he amassed La Liga totals of 91 goals in 241 games for Zaragoza, Espanyol, Celta and Osasuna. Over the course of his 16-year professional career, Milošević played for eight clubs and scored over 220 goals in nearly 600 official appearances.

At the international level, Milošević played for the national team of FR Yugoslavia (later renamed Serbia and Montenegro) and Serbia, making over 100 caps for both teams combined. He appeared in two World Cups and one European Championship, at which he earned the Golden Boot at Euro 2000.

==Club career==
===Partizan===
Milošević started playing football at the age of six and spent his youth in the Drina Valley. At the age of 14, he was spotted by Partizan scouts, who convinced the club to secure his transfer for 5,000 Deutsche Mark.

In 1992, Milošević made his senior debut for Partizan, scoring 14 goals in 31 games during his first season at the club. He went on to score an impressive 21 and 30 league goals in his next two seasons respectively – competition-bests in both years – as the Belgrade-based club won back-to-back national championships, including the double in the 1993–94 season.

===Aston Villa===
In the summer of 1995, then Aston Villa manager Brian Little bought Milošević from Partizan for £3.5 million, a club record at the time. His spell in England lasted three seasons, during which time he earned the tabloid nickname &quot;Miss-a-lot-ević&quot; owing to his frequent goalscoring dry spells.

However, Milošević did score 33 goals in 117 games for Villa (29 in the Premier League), including one in the 1996 Football League Cup final, a 3–0 win against Leeds United.

===Zaragoza===
Milošević signed for La Liga club Real Zaragoza in 1998 for £8.5 million, again recording some impressive goalscoring performances, notably netting 21 in the 1999–2000 season as the team secured fourth place.

===Parma===
After rediscovering his form in Spain, Milošević joined Parma in the summer of 2000 for €25 million. He was a regular starter in his first season in Italy, playing in 21 out of 34 Serie A matches and scoring 8 goals; in the next season, however, he was sparingly used.

Milošević was loaned back to Spain in January 2002, re-joining his former club Zaragoza to replace Blackburn Rovers-bound Yordi. He scored six times during his second spell, finishing as the club&#x27;s joint top scorer – alongside Yordi and Roberto Acuña. His second spell at Zaragoza ended unsuccessfully, with the club eventually relegated.

In the 2002–03 campaign, Milošević played for Espanyol on loan, again finishing as his team&#x27;s top scorer but narrowly escaping relegation, a fate that would befall him the following year with Celta de Vigo. Milošević was able to help Celta reach the round-of-16 in their first ever appearance in the UEFA Champions League, with his one goal in seven appearances in the competition coming in a 3–2 group stage home win against Ajax.

===Later years===
In mid-July 2004, aged 30, Milošević signed a three-year contract with another Spanish top flight club, Osasuna. In his second season with the Navarrese, he scored 11 goals in 32 games to help the team qualify for the Champions League. Though Milošević failed to score in ten appearances in the subsequent UEFA Cup semi-final run, he did provide two assists in a 3–0 away win against Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of the quarter-final (which Osasuna won 4–0 on aggregate).

In the summer of 2007, Milošević&#x27;s contract expired and he left Osasuna after three seasons at the club. He took an eight-month break from competitive football, during which – in October 2007 – he had a trial with Major League Soccer&#x27;s Toronto FC with a view of signing with them for the 2008 season. The deal fell through and, on 8 March 2008, he agreed terms with Rubin Kazan prior to the start of the Russian Premier League campaign.

On 2 November 2008, Milošević scored the decisive goal for Rubin in a game against Saturn Ramenskoye, securing the team their first ever national championship. He retired shortly afterwards, aged 35.

==International career==
Milošević represented the Yugoslavia under-21 national team at the 1992 Toulon Tournament, reaching the final with the team. He later earned 102 caps for Serbia, making his international debut for the nation (then named Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) on 23 December 1994, in a 2–0 friendly loss to Brazil. Milošević scored 37 goals for his country over the course of a 14-year international career.

After appearing in two games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Milošević scored five goals at UEFA Euro 2000, earning him the Golden Boot, an award he shared with Dutch forward Patrick Kluivert.

Milošević made his 100th international appearance on 16 June 2006 during the FIFA World Cup in Germany, in a 6–0 group stage loss against Argentina, becoming the first Serbian player to reach this milestone. As a formal farewell from international football, he was called up for a friendly with Bulgaria on 19 November 2008, scoring twice and missing two penalties in a 6–1 win before being replaced by Dragan Mrđa.

==Managerial career==
===Montenegro (assistant)===
From 2011 to 2012, Milošević was an assistant manager to Branko Brnović at the Montenegro national team.

===Partizan===
On 27 March 2019, Milošević was named by the board of directors at Partizan as the club&#x27;s new manager. His first win as Partizan manager came on 3 April 2019, beating Čukarički 3–2 at home.

In Milošević&#x27;s first Eternal derby as manager of Partizan, his team suffered a 2–1 away loss to Red Star Belgrade, with Ricardo Gomes&#x27;s 90th-minute strike proving only a consolation.

At the end of his first season in charge, Milošević succeeded in qualifying Partizan for the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds, and on 23 May 2019, won his first managerial trophy as his side beat Red Star Belgrade 1–0 in the 2018–19 Serbian Cup final, courtesy of a Bojan Ostojić goal.

In July and August 2019, Partizan secured their ninth participation in the group stages of the UEFA Europa League. Under Milošević&#x27;s leadership, Partizan knocked-out Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads, Yeni Malatyaspor and Molde in the qualifiers. On 30 August, Partizan was drawn in to Group L of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, alongside Manchester United, Astana and AZ Alkmaar.

===Olimpija Ljubljana===
On 16 June 2021, Milošević was named new manager of Slovenian PrvaLiga side Olimpija Ljubljana. He left the club less than four months later, on 10 October 2021.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
On 29 September 2023, Milošević was appointed as the new head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. He was victorious in his first game in charge against Liechtenstein in a UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying match on 13 October 2023. Milošević suffered his first defeat against Portugal on 16 October; Bosnia and Herzegovina lost the game 5–0 at Bilino Polje, the biggest defeat in its history on home ground.

Milošević&#x27;s contract expired on 21 March 2024, following the country&#x27;s defeat against Ukraine in the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying play-offs. On 16 April 2024, it was officially announced that the contract would not be extended.

=== Return to Partizan ===
In late September 2024, Milošević returned to Partizan succeeding Aleksandar Stanojević.

==Personal life==
Milošević was born into an ethnic Serb family in the Semberija city of Bijeljina and was raised in Johovac, both in present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, the then-SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia, where he lived with a younger brother Andrija (1975–2013) and younger sister Cvijeta &quot;Mira&quot;. He also holds Bosnian citizenship. Milošević&#x27;s mother died in 2000 from cancer; he has paternal ancestry from the large Milošević brotherhood of the Vasojevići tribe in northeastern Montenegro, and was a relative of Slobodan Milošević.

Milošević was a political supporter of the Democratic Party led by Boris Tadić, having supported it since 1993 after meeting with Zoran Đinđić and officially becoming a member in 2003. He took part in the 1996–97 protests and the 5 October overthrow.

Milošević was married to Vesna, with whom he has two sons and a daughter. One of his sons, Nikola, was also a footballer. Since 2017 he has been in a relationship with Serbian cellist Natalija Tipsarević. On 11 June 2011, his father Stevan (1953–2011) was shot in the chest and killed in the family house in Glavičice by his grandfather Savo (1928–2012), after a family row; the latter was later detained.

<doc id="1290858" wikidata="Q1411932" url="?curid=1290858" title="IMPATT diode">
<text>An IMPATT diode (impact ionization avalanche transit-time diode) is a form of high-power semiconductor diode used in high-frequency microwave electronics devices. They have negative resistance and are used as oscillators and amplifiers at microwave frequencies. They operate at frequencies of about 3 and 100 GHz, or higher. The main advantage is their high-power capability; single IMPATT diodes can produce continuous microwave outputs of up to 3 kilowatts, and pulsed outputs of much higher power. These diodes are used in a variety of applications from low-power radar systems to proximity alarms. A major drawback of IMPATT diodes is the high level of phase noise they generate. This results from the statistical nature of the avalanche process.

==Device structure==
The IMPATT diode family includes many different junctions and metal semiconductor devices. The first IMPATT oscillation was obtained from a simple silicon p–n junction diode biased into a reverse avalanche break down and mounted in a microwave cavity. Because of the strong dependence of the ionization coefficient on the electric field, most of the electron–hole pairs are generated in the high field region. The generated electron immediately moves into the N region, while the generated holes drift across the P region. The time required for the hole to reach the contact constitutes the transit time delay.

The original proposal for a microwave device of the IMPATT type was made by Read. The Read diode consists of two regions (1) the avalanche region (a region with relatively high doping and high field) in which avalanche multiplication occurs and (2) the drift region (a region with essentially intrinsic doping and constant field) in which the generated holes drift towards the contact. A similar device can be built with the configuration in which electrons generated from the avalanche multiplication drift through the intrinsic region.

An IMPATT diode generally is mounted in a microwave package. The diode is mounted with its low–field region close to a silicon heat sink so that the heat generated at the diode junction can be readily dissipated. Similar microwave packages are used to house other microwave devices.

The IMPATT diode operates over a narrow frequency band, and diode internal dimensions must correlate with the desired operating frequency. An IMPATT oscillator can be tuned by adjusting the resonant frequency of the coupled circuit, and also by varying the current in the diode; this can be used for frequency modulation.

==Principle of operation==
If a free electron with a sufficient energy strikes a silicon atom, it can break the covalent bond of silicon and liberate an electron from the covalent bond. If the electron liberated gains energy by being in an electric field and liberates other electrons from other covalent bonds then this process can cascade very quickly into a chain reaction, producing a large number of electrons and a large current flow. This phenomenon is called avalanche breakdown.

At breakdown, the n– region is punched through and forms the avalanche region of the diode. The high resistivity region is the drift zone through which the avalanche generated electrons move toward the anode.

Consider a dc bias VB, just short of that required to cause breakdown, applied to the diode. Let an AC voltage of sufficiently large magnitude be superimposed on the dc bias, such that during the positive cycle of the AC voltage, the diode is driven deep into the avalanche breakdown. At t=0, the AC voltage is zero, and only a small pre-breakdown current flows through the diode. As t increases, the voltage goes above the breakdown voltage and secondary electron-hole pairs are produced by impact ionization. As long as the field in the avalanche region is maintained above the breakdown field, the electron-hole concentration grows exponentially with t. Similarly this concentration decays exponentially with time when the field is reduced below breakdown voltage during the negative swing of the AC voltage. The holes generated in the avalanche region disappear in the p+ region and are collected by the cathode. The electrons are injected into the i – zone where they drift toward the n+ region. Then, the field in the avalanche region reaches its maximum value and the population of the electron-hole pairs starts building up. At this time, the ionization coefficients have their maximum values. The generated electron concentration does not follow the electric field instantaneously because it also depends on the number of electron-hole pairs already present in the avalanche region. Hence, the electron concentration at this point will have a small value. Even after the field has passed its maximum value, the electron-hole concentration continues to grow because the secondary carrier generation rate still remains above its average value. For this reason, the electron concentration in the avalanche region attains its maximum value when the field has dropped to its average value. Thus, it is clear that the avalanche region introduces a 90° phase shift between the AC signal and the electron concentration in this region.

With a further increase in t, the AC voltage becomes negative, and the field in the avalanche region drops below its critical value. The electrons in the avalanche region are then injected into the drift zone which induces a current in the external circuit which has a phase opposite to that of the AC voltage. The AC field, therefore, absorbs energy from the drifting electrons as they are decelerated by the decreasing field. It is clear that an ideal phase shift between the diode current and the AC signal is achieved if the thickness of the drift zone is such that the bunch of electron is collected at the n+ – anode at the moment the AC voltage goes to zero. This condition is achieved by making the length of the drift region equal to the wavelength of the signal. This situation produces an additional phase shift of 90° between the AC voltage and the diode current.

==Origins==
In 1956 W. T. Read and Ralph L. Johnston of Bell Telephone Laboratories proposed that an avalanche diode that exhibited significant transit time delay might exhibit a negative resistance characteristic. The effect was soon demonstrated in ordinary silicon diodes and by the late 1960s oscillators at 340 GHz had been produced. Silicon IMPATT diodes can produce up to 3 kilowatts of power continuously, with higher power available in pulses.

==TRAPATT ==
A microwave oscillator device with a similar structure to the IMPATT diode is the TRAPATT diode, which stands for &quot;trapped plasma avalanche triggered transit&quot;. This mode of operation produces relatively high power and efficiency, but at lower frequency than a device operated in IMPATT mode.

<text>Douglas Keith Scott (29 May 19417 December 2020) was an English mountaineer and climbing author, noted for being on the team that made the first ascent of the south-west face of Mount Everest on 24 September 1975. In receiving one of mountaineering&#x27;s highest honours, the Piolet d&#x27;Or Lifetime Achievement Award, his personal style and his climbs were described as &quot;visionary&quot;.

Over the years he was on 40 expeditions to the high mountains of Asia, during which he made some 30 first ascents. In 2020 he was diagnosed with cancer, and he died of the disease in December 2020.

==Early life==
Scott was born in Nottingham, England, and was the eldest of three sons. Scott would later discover that his mother was born at almost the exact same time as famed mountaineer Edmund Hillary, which Scott felt was an uncanny coincidence.

Scott was educated in Nottingham at Cottesmore Secondary Modern and Mundella Grammar schools. He started climbing at the age of 13, his interest sparked by seeing climbers on the Black Rocks in Derbyshire whilst hiking with the Scouts. His father, George Douglas Scott, was a policeman and amateur boxer, who was the Amateur Boxing Association 1945 British Heavyweight Champion. His father gave up the game to focus on the family. Scott lived on the outskirts of Nottingham with his father and mother, Edith Joyce Scott, and younger brothers, Brian and Garry. All were encouraged towards the open countryside, particularly the Peak District.

After two years at Loughborough Teachers&#x27; Training College (1959–61), Scott taught geography, history, PE and games for ten years at his old secondary modern school.

==Career==

=== Mountaineering ===
Scott was considered one of the world&#x27;s leading high-altitude and big-wall climbers and was the recipient of numerous awards for his achievements. He was the first English person to reach the summit of Mount Everest and, on the descent, he survived an unplanned bivouac with Dougal Haston 100 metres below the summit, without oxygen, sleeping bags and, as it turned out, without frostbite. Apart from his first ascent of the southwest face of Everest with Haston in 1975, all his other Himalayan climbs were achieved in lightweight or pure Alpine style. He pioneered big wall climbing on Baffin Island, Mount Kenya and in the Karakoram, famously on The Ogre with Chris Bonington, and later on Shivling in the Indian Himalayas.

Scott was a founder member of the Nottingham Climbers Club (1961), president of the Alpine Climbing Group (1976–82), vice president of the British Mountaineering Council (1994–97) and president of the Alpine Club (1999–2001). He was made a CBE in 1994. In 1999 he was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 2005 he was presented with the Golden Eagle Award by the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild. Also in 2005, following on from Tom Weir and Adam Watson, he became the third recipient of the John Muir Trust Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his mountaineering accomplishments and commitment to conservation and supporting mountain people and mountain environments around the world. Following on from Walter Bonatti and Reinhold Messner he received the Piolet d&#x27;Or Lifetime Achievement Award in Chamonix in 2011.

Scott was made a Freeman of the City of Nottingham in 1976 and has since had a Nottingham tram named after him. He was awarded an honorary MA by the universities of Nottingham and Loughborough, 1993; Hon. MEd Nottingham Trent, 1995; Hon Dr. Derby University, 2007; and Hon Dr. Loughborough University, 2017.

===Charity work in Nepal===
During Scott&#x27;s climbing career, his understanding of the culture and the people in the regions where he climbed grew as he formed strong bonds and relationships. In 1991 he raised the funds and organised the installation of 17 fresh-water standpipes in Askole, the last settlement before K2, that reduced infant mortality by half. He along with his wife Sharu Prabhu founded the charity &quot;Community Action Nepal&quot; (CAN), and spent much of his time fundraising for this cause and regularly visited some of the 60 CAN projects out in Nepal. Scott &amp; Prabhu were also advocates of responsible tourism &amp; set up Community Action Treks (CAT) in 1989 to help improve conditions of labour in the trekking industry. He received the British Guild of Travel Writers Tourism and Community Merit Award 1996, and CAT received the Responsible Tourism Award 2008. CAN was awarded the first British Expertise International (BEI) Charity Project of the Year Award along with CAN&#x27;s partner, WYG, in 2017.

=== Volunteering ===
Scott held various volunteering positions within the mountaineering community. He was a member of the Hunt Committee contributing to the Hunt Report on Outdoor Education 1976. He was British Mountaineering Council (BMC) representative on the UIAA and a member of the UIAA Management Committee 2008–2012; member of UIAA Mountaineering Commission and chairman of the Traditional Values Working Group 2011 until his death. He was chairman of Mount Everest Foundation 2014–2017 and vice chairman of the Mountain Heritage Trust 2014–2017. He was an honorary member of the Climbers Club, the Alpine Club and the American Alpine Club. He was a vice president of the BMC between 1994 and 1997 and went on to become a patron of the BMC in 2015.

<doc id="1290862" wikidata="Q859602" url="?curid=1290862" title="Gunn diode">
<text>A Gunn diode, also known as a transferred electron device (TED), is a form of diode, a two-terminal semiconductor electronic component, with negative differential resistance, used in high-frequency electronics. It is based on the &quot;Gunn effect&quot; discovered in 1962 by physicist J. B. Gunn. Its main uses are in electronic oscillators to generate microwaves, in applications such as radar speed guns, microwave relay data link transmitters, and automatic door openers.

Its internal construction is unlike other diodes in that it consists only of N-doped semiconductor material, whereas most diodes consist of both P and N-doped regions. It, therefore, conducts in both directions and cannot rectify alternating current like other diodes, which is why some sources do not use the term &quot;diode&quot; but prefer TED. In the Gunn diode, three regions exist: two are heavily N-doped on each terminal, with a thin layer of lightly n-doped material between them. When a voltage is applied to the device, the electrical gradient will be largest across the thin middle layer. If the voltage increases, the layer&#x27;s current will first increase. Still, eventually, at higher field values, the conductive properties of the middle layer are altered, increasing its resistivity and causing the current to fall. This means a Gunn diode has a region of negative differential resistance in its current–voltage characteristic curve, in which an increase of applied voltage causes a decrease in current. This property allows it to amplify, functioning as a radio frequency amplifier, or to become unstable and oscillate when it is biased with a DC voltage.

==Gunn diode oscillators==
The negative differential resistance, combined with the timing properties of the intermediate layer, is responsible for the diode&#x27;s largest use: in electronic oscillators at microwave frequencies and above. A microwave oscillator can be created simply by applying a DC voltage to bias the device into its negative resistance region. In effect, the diode&#x27;s negative differential resistance cancels the load circuit&#x27;s positive resistance, thus creating a circuit with zero differential resistance, which will produce spontaneous oscillations. The oscillation frequency is determined partly by the properties of the middle diode layer but can be tuned by external factors. In practical oscillators, an electronic resonator is usually added to control frequency in the form of a waveguide, microwave cavity, or YIG sphere. The diode is usually mounted inside the cavity. The diode cancels the resonator&#x27;s loss resistance, producing oscillations at its resonant frequency. The frequency can be tuned mechanically, by adjusting the size of the cavity, or in the case of YIG spheres, by changing the magnetic field. Gunn diodes are used to build oscillators in the 10 GHz to THz frequency range.

Gallium arsenide Gunn diodes are made for frequencies up to 200 GHz, gallium nitride materials can reach up to 3 terahertz.

==History==
The Gunn diode is based on the Gunn effect, and both are named for physicist J. B. Gunn. At IBM in 1962, he discovered the effect because he refused to accept inconsistent experimental results in gallium arsenide as &quot;noise&quot;, and determined the cause. Alan Chynoweth of Bell Telephone Laboratories showed in June 1965 that only a transferred-electron mechanism could explain the experimental results. It was realized that the oscillations he detected were explained by the Ridley–Watkins–Hilsum theory, named for British physicists Brian Ridley, Tom Watkins and Cyril Hilsum who in scientific papers in 1961 showed that bulk semiconductors could display &quot;negative resistance&quot;, meaning that increasing the applied voltage causes the current to &quot;decrease&quot;.

The Gunn effect and its relation to the Watkins–Ridley–Hilsum effect entered electronics literature in the early 1970s, e.g., in books on transferred electron devices and, more recently, on nonlinear wave methods for charge transport.

== Principle ==

The electronic band structure of some semiconductor materials, including gallium arsenide (GaAs), have another energy band or sub-band in addition to the valence and conduction bands which define a semiconductor material and which is exploited to design semiconductor devices. This third band (there could be more of them) is at higher energy than the normal conduction band and is typically empty at room temperature until energy is supplied to promote electrons to it. The energy comes from the kinetic energy of ballistic electrons, that is, electrons in the conduction band but moving with sufficient kinetic energy such that they are able to reach the higher band. The additional kinetic energy is typically provided by an electric field, applied externally to the device.

These electrons either start below the Fermi level and are given a sufficiently long mean free path to acquire the needed energy by applying a strong electric field, or they are injected by a cathode with the right energy. With forward voltage applied, the Fermi level in the cathode moves into the third band, and reflections of ballistic electrons starting around the Fermi level are minimized by matching the density of states and using the additional interface layers to let the reflected waves interfere destructively.

In GaAs, the effective mass of the electrons in the third band is higher than those in the usual conduction band, so the mobility or drift velocity of the electrons in that band is lower. As the forward voltage increases, more and more electrons can reach the higher energy band, causing them to move slower (though they have higher energies), and the current through the device decreases. This creates a region of negative differential resistance in the voltage/current relationship.

When a high enough potential is applied to the diode, the charge carrier density along the cathode becomes unstable and will develop small segments of low conductivity, with the rest of the cathode having high conductivity. Most of the cathode voltage drop will occur across the segment so that it will have a high electric field. Under the influence of this electric field, it will move along the cathode to the anode. It is impossible to balance the population in both bands, so thin slices of high-field strength will always be in a background of low-field strength. So in practice, with a slight increase in forward voltage, a low conductivity segment is created at the cathode, resistance increases, the segment moves along the bar to the anode, and when it reaches the anode, it is absorbed, and a new segment is created at the cathode to keep the total voltage constant. Any existing slice is quenched if the voltage is lowered and resistance decreases again.

In this context, ballistic electrons—those that travel with minimal scattering—play a crucial role. They can move through the semiconductor with a long mean free path, effectively gaining the necessary energy to transition to the higher energy states.

The laboratory methods used to select materials for manufacturing Gunn diodes include angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

== Applications ==
Because of their high-frequency capability, Gunn diodes are mainly used at microwave frequencies and above. They can produce some of the highest output power of any semiconductor device at these frequencies. Their most common use is in oscillators, but they are also used in microwave amplifiers to amplify signals. Because the diode is a one-port (two terminal) device, an amplifier circuit must separate the outgoing amplified signal from the incoming input signal to prevent coupling. One common circuit is a &quot;reflection amplifier&quot; that separates the signals using a circulator. A bias tee is needed to isolate the bias current from the high-frequency oscillations.

=== Sensors and measuring instruments ===
Gunn diode oscillators generate microwave power for: airborne collision avoidance radar, anti-lock brakes, sensors for monitoring the flow of traffic, car radar detectors, pedestrian safety systems, &quot;distance travelled&quot; recorders, motion detectors, &quot;slow-speed&quot; sensors (to detect pedestrian and traffic movement up to 85 km/h (50 mph)), traffic signal controllers, automatic door openers, automatic traffic gates, process control equipment to monitor throughput, burglar alarms and equipment to detect trespassers, sensors to avoid derailment of trains, remote vibration detectors, rotational speed tachometers, moisture content monitors.

=== Radio amateur use ===
By virtue of their low voltage operation, Gunn diodes can serve as microwave frequency generators for very low-powered (few-milliwatt) microwave transceivers called Gunnplexers. British radio amateurs first used them in the late 1970s, and many Gunnplexer designs have been published in journals. They typically consist of an approximately 3 inch waveguide into which the diode is mounted. A low voltage (less than 12 volt) direct current power supply that can be modulated appropriately is used to drive the diode. The waveguide is blocked at one end to form a resonant cavity, and the other end usually feeds a horn antenna. An additional &quot;mixer diode&quot; is inserted into the waveguide, and it is often connected to a modified FM broadcast receiver to enable listening of other amateur stations. Gunnplexers are most commonly used in the 10 GHz and 24 GHz ham bands, and sometimes 22 GHz security alarms are modified as the diode(s) can be put in a slightly detuned cavity with layers of copper or aluminium foil on opposite edges for moving to the licensed amateur band.
If intact, the mixer diode is reused in its existing waveguide, and these parts are well known for being extremely static sensitive.
On most commercial units, this part is protected with a parallel resistor and other components, and a variant is used in some Rb atomic clocks.
The mixer diode is useful for lower frequency applications even if the Gunn diode is weakened from use, and some amateur radio enthusiasts have used them in conjunction with an external oscillator or n/2 wavelength Gunn diode for satellite finding and other applications.

=== Radio astronomy ===
Gunn oscillators are used as local oscillators for millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radio astronomy receivers. The Gunn diode is mounted in a cavity tuned to resonate at twice the fundamental frequency of the diode. The cavity length is changed by a micrometer adjustment. Gunn oscillators capable of generating over 50 mW over a 50% tuning range (one waveguide band) are available.

The Gunn oscillator frequency is multiplied by a diode frequency multiplier for submillimeter-wave applications.

<doc id="1290867" wikidata="Q15001" url="?curid=1290867" title="Alexander Griboyedov">
<text>Alexander Sergeyevich Griboyedov (; 15 January 179511 February 1829) was a Russian diplomat, playwright, poet, and composer. His one notable work is the 1823 verse comedy &quot;Woe from Wit&quot;. He was Russia&#x27;s ambassador to Qajar Persia, where he and all the embassy staff were massacred by an angry mob in the aftermath of the ratification of the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), which confirmed the cession to Russia of Persia&#x27;s northern territories comprising Transcaucasia and parts of the North Caucasus. Griboyedov played a pivotal role in the ratification of the treaty. The immediate cause for the incident was Griboyedov giving refuge to Armenians who had escaped from the harems of the Persian shah and his son.

==Early life==
Griboyedov was born in Moscow, the exact year unknown, with biographers debating whether it was in 1790 or 1795. His mother who dreamed of providing him with a career made sure Griboyedov received the best education.

He received a master&#x27;s degree in philology from Moscow University, and subsequently enrolled in the doctorate program. Griboyedov was fluent in all major European languages such as French, English, German, Italian, Greek, Latin, and mastered oriental languages like Arabic, Persian and Turkish. According to Pushkin Griboyedov was one of the smartest people in Russia at the time.

In 1812, he quit the program and enrolled in the military. He obtained a commission in a hussar regiment, which he resigned in 1816. The next year, he entered the civil service. In 1818 he was appointed secretary of the Russian legation in Persia, and transferred to Georgia.

He possessed musical talent, played the piano and composed several waltzes. Only two of his waltzes survive to the present day, although it is recorded that he composed several, including vaudevilles in association with stage plays. He is best known for his literary compositions and poetic verses.

His verse comedy &quot;The Young Spouses&quot; (, &quot;Molodye Suprugi&quot;), loosely based on a French play by Auguste Creuzé de Lesser, which Griboyedov staged in Saint Petersburg in 1816, was followed by other similar works, mostly either translated or co-authored with more experienced writers of the day. Neither these nor his essays and poetry would have been long remembered but for the success of his verse comedy &quot;Woe from Wit&quot; (, &quot;Gore ot uma&quot;), a satire on Russian aristocratic society.

As a high official in the play puts it, this work is &quot;a pasquinade on Moscow&quot;. The play depicts certain social and official stereotypes in the characters of Famusov, who hates reform; his secretary, Molchalin, who fawns over officials; and the aristocratic young liberal and Anglomaniac, Repetilov. By contrast the hero of the piece, Chatsky, an ironic satirist just returned from western Europe, exposes and ridicules the weaknesses of the rest. His words echo the outcry of the young generation in the lead-up to the Decembrist revolt of 1825.

In Russia for the summer of 1823, Griboyedov completed the play and took it to Saint Petersburg. It was rejected by the censors. Many copies were made and privately circulated, but Griboyedov never saw it published. After his death the manuscript was jointly owned by his wife Nina Alexandrovna Griboyedova and his sister Maria Sergeyevna Durnovo (Griboyedova). The first edition was not published until 1833, four years after his death. Only once did he see it on the stage, when it was performed by the officers of the garrison at Yerevan. Soured by disappointment, he returned to Georgia. During the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, he put his linguistic expertise at the service of general Ivan Paskevich, a relative. After this, he was sent to Saint Petersburg where he worked on the Treaty of Turkmenchay negotiations. There, thinking to devote himself to literature, he started work on a romantic drama, &quot;A Georgian Night&quot; (, &quot;Gruzinskaya noch&quot;), based on Georgian legends.

== Musical life ==
Alexander Griboyedov&#x27;s education was not only extensive, continuing into doctoral work before shifting to military training, but had included musical study as well. Although producing only a small number of works during his lifetime, he was well experienced in an array of instruments including piano, organ, and flute. During his musical study, it is recorded that he studied with the Irish pianist, composer, and ostensible &quot;creator&quot; of the nocturne form John Field, along with Johann Heinrich Müller in the field of music theory.

Grioboyedov was regarded as a &quot;very good musician&quot; by the likes of Mikhail Glinka, and had routine salons at his residence which were attended by many musical luminaries of his time, although relatively minor in the contemporary decade, including Vladimir Odoevsky, Alexander Alyabyev, Mikhail Vielgorsky, and Alexey Verstovsky.

Out of work as a composer, only two compositions survive to the present, those being his two waltzes in A-flat major and E minor. He is known to have composed the musical score to the opera-vaudeville (or operetta) called &quot;Who is a Brother, Who is a Sister, or Deception for Deception&quot; (1824), written by the composer himself in collaboration with Pyotr Vyazemsky.

==Death==


Several months after his wedding to Nino, the 16-year-old daughter of his friend Prince Chavchavadze, Griboyedov was suddenly sent to Persia as Minister Plenipotentiary. In the aftermath of the Russo–Persian War of 1826–1828 and the humiliating Treaty of Turkmenchay, there was strong anti-Russian sentiment in Persia. Upon arrival in Tehran, the Order of the Lion and the Sun was conferred on him. Soon after Griboyedov&#x27;s arrival, a mob stormed the Russian embassy.

The incident began when an Armenian eunuch escaped from the harem of the Persian shah, and at the same time two enslaved Armenian women escaped from the harem of the Shah&#x27;s son-in-law. All three sought refuge at the Russian legation. As agreed in the Treaty of Turkmenchay, Georgians and Armenians living in Persia at that time were permitted to move to Russian-controlled Georgia and Eastern Armenia. However, the Shah demanded that Griboyedov return the three escapees. Griboyedov refused. His decision caused an uproar throughout the city and several thousand Persians encircled the Russian compound demanding their release.

Soon after, urged on by the mullahs, the mob stormed the building. A high-ranking Muslim scholar, Mirza Masih Astarabadi, issued a fatwa saying that freeing Muslim women from the claws of unbelievers is allowed.

Griboyedov and other members of his mission had prepared for a siege and sealed all the windows and doors. Armed and in full uniform, they were resolved to defend to the last drop of blood. Although small in number, the Cossack detachment assigned to protect the legation held off the mob for over an hour until finally being driven back to Griboyedov&#x27;s office. There, Griboyedov and the Cossacks resisted until the mob broke through the roof of the building, and then through the ceiling, to slaughter them. The escaped eunuch and Griboyedov, who fought with his sword, were among the first to be shot to death; the fate of the two Armenian women remains unknown. Second secretary of the mission Karl Adelung and, in particular, a young doctor whose name is not known, fought hard, but soon the scene was one of butchered, decapitated corpses.

Griboyedov&#x27;s body, thrown from a window, was decapitated by a kebab vendor who displayed the head on his stall. The mob dragged the uniformed corpse through the city&#x27;s streets and bazaars, to cries of celebration. It was eventually abandoned on a garbage heap after three days of ill-treatment by the mob, such that in the end it could be identified only by a duelling injury to a finger. The following June, Griboyedov&#x27;s friend Alexander Pushkin, travelling through the southern Caucasus, encountered some men from Tehran leading an oxcart. The men told Pushkin they were conveying the ambassador&#x27;s remains to Tiflis (now Tbilisi).
Griboyedov was buried there, in the monastery of St. David (Mtatsminda Pantheon).

When Nino, Griboyedov&#x27;s widow, received news of his death she gave premature birth to a child who died a few hours later. Nino lived another thirty years, rejecting all suitors and winning universal admiration for her fidelity to her husband&#x27;s memory.

In a move to compensate Russia for the attack and the death of its ambassador, the Shah sent his grandson Khosrow Mirza to Saint Petersburg to avoid another war with Tsar Nicholas I. The Shah also gifted to the Tsar the Shah Diamond.

Russian sources claim that British agents, who feared Russian influence in Tehran, and Persian reactionaries, who were not satisfied with the Treaty of Turkmenchay, were responsible for inciting the mob. According to George Bournoutian, the Tsar and General Paskevich likely did not greatly regret the loss of Griboyedov, who held liberal beliefs and favored autonomy for Christians in Transcaucasia. The Russo–Turkish War of 1828–29 might have been another reason for the Russian inaction. His wife had written on his tombstone in Tiflis: “Your mind and works are immortal in Russian memory, but why has my love outlived you?&quot;

==Legacy==
Author Angela Brintlinger has said that &quot;not only did Griboyedov&#x27;s contemporaries conceive of his life as the life of a literary hero—ultimately writing a number of narratives featuring him as an essential character—but indeed Griboyedov saw himself as a hero and his life as a narrative. Although there is not a literary artifact to prove this, by examining Griboyedov&#x27;s letters and dispatches, one is able to build a historical narrative that fits the literary and behavioural paradigms of his time and that reads like a real adventure novel set in the wild, wild East.&quot;

One of the main settings for Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; is named after Griboyedov, as is the Griboyedov Canal in Central Saint Petersburg. One of the central streets of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, is named after Griboyedov. This street is crossed by Alexander Chavchavadze street, named after Griboyedov&#x27;s father-in-law, famous Georgian poet, Alexander Chavchavadze.

On 17 April 1944 Pravda ran a lengthy feature on the commemoration of Griboyedov&#x27;s 150th birthday when high-ranking officials, military leaders, diplomats, writers, and artists had attended a celebration in the Bolshoi Theatre. Novelist and Stalin deputy Leonid Leonov eulogized Griboyedov, mentioning especially his love of his fatherland.

The reception to the Shah&#x27;s grandson Khosrow Mirza in the Winter Palace, and Tsar Nicholas receiving from him the Shah Diamond, are featured in the 2002 Russian film &quot;Russian Ark&quot;.

<doc id="1290873" wikidata="Q746181" url="?curid=1290873" title="James Bond Theme">
<text>The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; is the main signature theme music of the James Bond films and has been used in every Bond film since &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962. Composed in E minor by Monty Norman (with arrangements for film provided by John Barry and others), the piece has been used as an accompanying fanfare to the gun barrel sequence in every Eon Productions Bond film besides &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (played fully, instead, at the end of that film).

The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; has accompanied the opening titles twice, as part of the medley that opens &quot;Dr. No&quot; and then again in the opening credits of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. It has been used as music over the end credits for &quot;Dr. No&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;Skyfall&quot;, and &quot;Spectre&quot;. In 2008, the original recording of &quot;The James Bond Theme&quot; by The John Barry Seven And Orchestra on the United Artists label was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Authorship and origin==
Monty Norman wrote and composed the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; and received royalties from 1962 until his death in 2022. Norman collected around £600,000 in royalties between 1976 and 1999. For &quot;Dr. No&quot;, Norman scored the film and the theme was arranged by John Barry, who would later go on to compose the soundtracks for eleven James Bond films. Courts have ruled that the theme was written by Norman, despite claims and testimony by Barry that he had actually written the theme. Norman consequently won two libel actions against publishers for claiming that Barry wrote the theme, most recently against &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2001.

Norman describes the distinctive rhythm of the guitar in the first few bars of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; as &quot;Dum di-di dum dum&quot;. He said that it was inspired by &quot;Bad Sign, Good Sign&quot;, a song he composed for a musical adaptation of V. S. Naipaul&#x27;s novel &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot;, set in the Indian community in Trinidad. Norman showed his manuscript music from &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot; in a filmed interview and sang its lyrics. In 2005, Norman released an album called &quot;Completing the Circle&quot; that features &quot;Bad Sign, Good Sign&quot;, the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;, and a similar-sounding song titled &quot;Dum Di-Di Dum Dum&quot;. For these songs Norman added lyrics that explain the origin and history of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;.

Though the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; is identified with John Barry&#x27;s jazz arrangement, parts of it are heard throughout Monty Norman&#x27;s score for &quot;Dr. No&quot; in non-jazzy guises. Barry&#x27;s arrangement is repeated (&quot;tracked&quot;) in various scenes of the first Bond film. This is consistent with the account given by Barry and some of the film-makers, contained in supplementary material on the DVD release of &quot;Dr. No&quot;: Barry was called in to make an arrangement of Norman&#x27;s motif after Norman had completed the score. There is no information about the distinctive ostinati, countermelodies, and bridges introduced by Barry that are juxtaposed with Norman&#x27;s motif in order to flesh out the arrangement. These added musical figures have become as recognizable to listeners as Norman&#x27;s motif, which is probably responsible for the controversy over the authorship of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; as listeners have come to know it.

The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; was recorded on 21 June 1962, using five saxophones, nine brass instruments, a solo guitar and a rhythm section. The guitar motif heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Vic Flick on a 1939 English Clifford Essex Paragon Deluxe guitar plugged into a Fender Vibrolux amplifier. Flick was paid a one-off fee of £6 for recording the famous James Bond Theme motif. John Scott played the saxophone. Barry, who was paid £250 for his work, was surprised that his theme appeared so often in &quot;Dr. No&quot;. He was told by Noel Rogers, the head of United Artists Music, that though the producers would not give him any more money or a writing credit they would get in touch with him if there was another Bond film made.

==Use in the James Bond films==

Within the Bond films themselves, many different arrangements of the theme have been used, often reflecting the musical tastes of the specific times. The electric guitar version of the theme is most associated with the Sean Connery era although it was also used in some Roger Moore films, in Timothy Dalton&#x27;s final film &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and in the Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig with the arrangement by David Arnold.

For every Bond movie which John Barry scored, he orchestrated a slightly different version of the Bond theme, as can be heard during the gun barrel sequence. These specialised Bond themes often reflected the style and locations featured in the movie, and the actor playing Bond.

The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; and its variations found in the movies are played during many different types of scenes. Early in the series, the theme provided background music to Connery&#x27;s entrances. It was not until &quot;Goldfinger&quot; that John Barry began to use the theme as an action cue. Since then, the primary use of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; has been with action scenes.

===Sean Connery (1962–1967)===
The first appearance of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; was in &quot;Dr. No&quot;. There it was used as part of the actual gun barrel and main title sequence. It was also used when Bond first introduces himself.

In &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; appears not only in the gun barrel pre-title sequence, but as part of the main title theme and in the track &quot;James Bond with Bongos&quot;. It is a slower, jazzier, somewhat punchier rendition than the original orchestration. The original Barry arrangement from &quot;Dr. No&quot; is heard during a check of Bond&#x27;s room for listening devices.

In &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; can be heard on the soundtrack in &quot;Bond Back in Action Again&quot; (gun barrel and pre-title sequence). The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; for this movie is heavily influenced by the brassy, jazzy theme song sung by Shirley Bassey.

&quot;Thunderball&quot; used a full orchestral version of the theme in the track &quot;Chateau Flight&quot;. Another full orchestral version was intended for the end titles of the film.

&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; had a funereal orchestration with Bond&#x27;s &quot;burial&quot; at sea sequence in Hong Kong harbour. A full orchestral version of the theme was used in the &quot;Little Nellie&quot; autogyro fight scene.

===George Lazenby (1969)===
The George Lazenby film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; used a unique high-pitched arrangement with the melody played on a Moog synthesizer. The cue is called &quot;This Never Happened to the Other Feller&quot; and a similar recording was used over the film&#x27;s end credits. The film has a downbeat ending and the explosive burst of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; at the film&#x27;s very end suggests Bond will return in spite of the situation he finds himself in at the climax of this movie.

===Sean Connery (1971)===
With the return of Sean Connery in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, the guitar made a comeback along with a full orchestral version during a hovercraft sequence. On the soundtrack, this track is named &quot;Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd/Bond to Holland.&quot;

===Roger Moore (1973–1985)===
When Roger Moore came to the role, the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; became a string orchestra driven piece. In &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, the James Bond theme was featured in a Funk-inspired version of the tune reflecting the music of Blaxploitation films popular at the time.

The brief quote of the theme in the pre-credits music of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, titled &quot;Bond 77&quot;, featured a disco sound, reflecting a style of music which was very popular at the time. &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; returned briefly to using the surf-rock guitar associated with the theme from the early days.

One unusual instance occurred in &quot;Octopussy&quot;, when Bond&#x27;s contact, who is disguised as a snake charmer, plays a few notes of the tune for Roger Moore&#x27;s James Bond, presumably as a pre-arranged identification signal. This is an example of the tune being used as diegetic music.

In Moore&#x27;s last Bond film, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, the melody of the theme was played on strings.

===Timothy Dalton (1987–1989)===
The first Bond film with Timothy Dalton, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, which was the last Bond film scored by Barry, used a symphonic version with the melody played on strings. This version of the Bond theme is notable for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with the orchestra – at the time, a relatively new innovation.

In &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, the Bond theme was arranged by Michael Kamen using rock drums to symbolise a harder and more violent Bond. This gun barrel is the first one since &quot;Dr. No&quot; not starting with the Bond theme, but orchestral hits though the surf guitar makes returns soon after.

===Pierce Brosnan (1995–2002)===
The gun barrel of the Pierce Brosnan film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; opened with a synthesised arrangement by Éric Serra which plays the guitar riff on (almost indistinct) kettle drums. A more traditional rendition by John Altman is heard in the film during the tank chase in St. Petersburg. This version of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; is not included in the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; soundtrack. Additionally, Starr Parodi composed a version of the James Bond Theme for the 1995 trailer.

David Arnold&#x27;s gun barrel arrangements in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; dropped the guitar melody line, jumping straight from the tune&#x27;s opening to its concluding bars. An electronic rhythm was added to the gun barrel of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. The typical Bond guitar line can be heard during some action scenes.

The &quot;Die Another Day&quot; gun barrel recalls the version of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; but with a more techno-influenced rhythm. It also contains the guitar riff of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;.

=== Daniel Craig (2006–2021) ===
Daniel Craig&#x27;s first James Bond film, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, does not feature the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; in its entirety until the very end of the movie during a climactic scene. In &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the main notes of the song &quot;You Know My Name&quot; are played throughout the film as a substitute for the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. A new recording of the classic theme, titled &quot;The Name&#x27;s Bond…James Bond&quot;, only plays during the end credits to signal the beginning of the character&#x27;s new arc as the 21st century version of James Bond. Although that is the first time the theme is played in its entirety, the first bars of the song (the chord progression) appeared as a slow background music in seven moments throughout the movie: after Bond&#x27;s conversation with M (during his flight), after winning the Aston Martin, when he makes his first appearance in a tuxedo (accompanied by a few bars of the bridge), after he has survived the poisoned martini, when he wins the final match at Casino Royale, when Bond is following Vesper Lynd, and when Bond speaks with M on the phone.

At the end of &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, the theme appears with Craig&#x27;s new official gun barrel sequence, unusually shown at the end of the film. The theme here is very similar to the classic style in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. It appears sparingly throughout the score itself, never in an immediately recognizable variation. David Arnold said in an interview on the DVD extras for &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; that the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; is what he expects to hear as an audience member in action scenes, yet his scores for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; only use it during the end credits.

The next film, &quot;Skyfall&quot;, includes the theme as part of the harmony to Adele&#x27;s vocals and is used as the chord progression, including a faint surf guitar riff. Also, in a similar way to &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, the gun barrel sequence is shown at the end of the film. The theme that plays along with the sequence and into the end credits is David Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; track &quot;The Name&#x27;s Bond…James Bond&quot;. Despite this, the film&#x27;s score was composed by Thomas Newman, who also incorporated the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; throughout the entire film.

In &quot;Spectre&quot;, the theme appears at the beginning of the film as part of the opening gun barrel sequence, indicating a return to the franchise&#x27;s classic era of 1962 to 2002.

The theme is used again in &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, in the tracks named &quot;Gun Barrel&quot; and &quot;Back to MI6&quot;. A reworked, salsa-like version was used in &quot;Cuba Chase&quot;. This is the only film in the Craig era that doesn&#x27;t use the Bond theme in the credits, instead using &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot; from &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. This is because of Bond&#x27;s death at the end of the film. Additionally, the film&#x27;s title track performed by Billie Eilish features a single trumpet solo interpolating the theme.

==Chart performance==
The John Barry Orchestra recording peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart on the week of 6–12 December 1962.

==Cover versions==
Apart from the James Bond soundtracks themselves, John Barry re-recorded the James Bond Theme in 1966 for his CBS album &quot;The Great Movie Sounds of John Barry&quot;, which features driving percussion ostinati (with a prominent role for bongos), as well as a piano and brass improvisation superimposed over the last few bars. For his 1972 Polydor album &quot;The Concert John Barry&quot;, he re-scored the theme again as part of a James Bond suite for full symphony orchestra, in this case the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. This more lush arrangement was to feature in his later Bond film scores, notably &quot;Octopussy&quot;.

Over 70 cover versions of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; have been recorded by artists such as:

===Moby&#x27;s remix===

American electronica musician Moby produced a remixed version of the theme entitled &quot;James Bond Theme (Moby&#x27;s Re-Version)&quot; for the Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. It first appeared as the second track on &quot;I Like to Score&quot;, a compilation of Moby&#x27;s songs used in films, and later featured as the fifteenth and final track on the &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; soundtrack album. Moby has said &quot;It did feel a little strange remixing something that was perfect in its original state&quot;, further admitting that he &quot;still thinks the original is miles better than the version I did&quot;.

Released as a single, &quot;James Bond Theme (Moby&#x27;s Re-Version)&quot; charted at number eight on the UK Singles Chart, besting &quot;Go&quot;&#x27;s number 10 peak six years earlier to become, at the time, Moby&#x27;s highest-peaking single on the chart. It also reached number one in Iceland and peaked within the top 20 in Finland, Ireland, and Switzerland.

The song features two samples of dialogue from the Bond films: Pierce Brosnan saying &quot;Bond, James Bond&quot; as heard in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, and the conversation between Sean Connery, as Bond, and Auric Goldfinger in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;: &quot;Do you expect me to talk?&quot; / &quot;No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.&quot;

==Video games==
* An 8-bit recording of the song was used in James Bond&#x27;s inaugural video game, &quot;James Bond 007&quot; for the Atari 2600 and other contemporary systems.
* Sega recorded an 8-bit version for Game Gear/Master System and the first 16-bit version for Sega Genesis of the tune for &quot;James Bond 007: The Duel&quot; (known as 007 Shitou −007死闘- in Japan.)
* The opening gun barrel sequence for the Nintendo 64 game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; uses a rock-influenced version of the theme. The game&#x27;s soundtrack also makes recurring use of its motifs throughout, with corresponding variations in rhythm, scale and instrumentation.
* An original cover recording for the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; was also created by Richard Fortus as downloadable content for the video game &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot; (a case of corporate synergy, as &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; publisher Activision also held the license to produce games based on the James Bond franchise at the time). Fortus later played the tune live with Guns N&#x27; Roses during their 2012 tour.
* An electrified version of the theme is played in the credits of the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; game for the Wii.

<text>Raquette Lake is the source of the Raquette River in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. It is near the community of Raquette Lake, New York. The lake has of shoreline with pines and mountains bordering the lake. It is located in the towns of Long Lake and Arietta, both in Hamilton County.

Raquette Lake is popular, especially in summer, due to the scenery, wildlife, boating and hiking. There are several children&#x27;s summer camps, including Raquette Lake Boys Camp and Raquette Lake Girls Camp. In winter, substantial snowfall makes the area popular for snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. The lake is also part of the 740-mile Northern Forest Canoe Trail, which begins in Old Forge, NY and ends in Fort Kent, ME.

==History==
The origin of the name is uncertain. One account is that it was named for snowshoes (&quot;raquette&quot; in French) left by a party of Tories led by Sir John Johnson in 1776. Traveling by snowshoe, they were overtaken by a spring thaw when they reached the lake. They left the snowshoes &quot;en masse&quot; on the shore.

Raquette Lake developed into one of the most prestigious summer getaways for the elite in the 19th century. In 1877, William West Durant started work on what would become the first of the &quot;Great Camps&quot;, Pine Knot. Other summer homes in the &quot;great camp style&quot; on Raquette Lake include North Point (the 1870 buildings replaced by Lucy Carnegie in 1903), Echo Camp (1883) and Bluff Point (1876).

Raquette Lake served as a midpoint to other Gilded Age retreats such as the Great Camps Sagamore (1897; now a National Historic Landmark), Camp Uncas (1890; became a National Historic Landmark in fall 2008), and Kamp Kill Kare (1896) on nearby lakes Sagamore, Mohegan, and Kora, respectively. Sagamore is open to the public for guided tours during non-winter months and also as an educational facility.

==Bluff Point and William West Durant==
Bluff Point is still a private camp and run much as it was over 100 years ago. It was built by Francis Stott of Stottville, New York, at the suggestion of Dr. Thomas C. Durant. Durant and Mrs. Stott&#x27;s family had briefly been in business together as Durant, Lathrop &amp; Co. in Albany, New York, during the 1840s. When Bluff Point was sold to magazine publisher Robert Collier in 1905, most of the original structures were modified and expanded into the present score of buildings — the huge walk-in fireplace, the bowling alley, the bridge to the gazebo, etc.

==Pine Knot and William West Durant==

Pine Knot, Uncas and Sagamore were designed using natural materials native to the Adirondacks by William West Durant, the son of Thomas C. Durant. The senior Durant was most famous for the building the eastern half of the Transcontinental Railroad. The first of these &quot;Great Camps&quot; was Camp Pine Knot, started by Thomas and taken over by William in 1879. The construction continued through 1890. This artistic camp was used by W.W. Durant as a showcase, as he wined and dined railroad tycoons, selling them on the idea of his building a camp for each of them.

In 1895, W.W. Durant sold the camp to Collis P. Huntington (builder of the western half of the Transcontinental Railroad) in partial repayment of a debt. In 1949, Archer Huntington gave the camp to SUNY Cortland, to be used for education and never to be turned over to the state. In 1938, the family provided the land for the Raquette Lake Chapel in the village for $1.

William West Durant also provided the funding for two summer chapels on Raquette Lake, accessible only by water. The Church of the Good Shepherd (1880) and St. William&#x27;s Catholic Church on Long Point (1890) were each designed by J. Cleaveland Cady of Cady, Berg &amp; See, New York City.

<text>Mon oncle Antoine (&quot;My Uncle Antoine&quot;) is a 1971 French-language Canadian drama film directed by Claude Jutra for the National Film Board of Canada.

The film depicts life in the Maurice Duplessis-era Asbestos Region of rural Québec before the Asbestos Strike of 1949. Set at Christmas time, the story is told from the point of view of 15-year-old boy Benoît (Jacques Gagnon) who is coming of age in a mining town. The Asbestos Strike is regarded by Québec historians as a seminal event in the years before the Quiet Revolution ( 1959–1970).

The film is an examination of the social conditions in Québec&#x27;s old, agrarian, conservative and cleric-dominated society on the eve of the social and political changes that transformed the province a decade later.

The film was selected as the Canadian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
Benoît is a young teenage boy living in rural Quebec. He works at the town general store belonging to his aunt Cécile and his uncle Antoine, who is also the town undertaker. On 24 December, he begins work, setting up the store display much to the delight of the town and flirting with Carmen, the young girl whom his uncle and aunt employ, and treat as an adopted child.

Madame Jos Poulin&#x27;s eldest son, Marcel, dies that day, and she places a call to the store asking if Antoine can come to take care of the body. For the first time, Benoît is allowed to go with him. After they load the body into a coffin, they prepare to take it home. However, on the way home, Benoît encourages the horse to run as quickly as possible causing the coffin to fall off the sleigh. He tries to get Antoine to help put the coffin back on the sleigh; however, Antoine who has been steadily drinking throughout the day is unable to lift the coffin. He confesses to Benoît that he hates dealing with the dead bodies and that he is miserable in his life, wishing that he had achieved his dream of owning a hotel in the United States as he had wanted. He confesses that, although he treats Benoît and Carmen like his own, he regrets that his wife was unable to give him children.

Angry with Antoine, Benoît manages to get him back in the sleigh and returns home. He runs up the stairs to get help from his aunt and discovers her embracing Fernand, the help, in her nightgown. Realizing what has happened, Fernand takes Benoît out in the sleigh to look for the body. Traumatized by seeing his aunt and Fernand together, Benoît is no help in remembering where the coffin fell off the sleigh. Eventually they make it back to the Poulin household where they find the entire Poulin family, including Jos, the father, who had been away working, around the coffin mourning the loss of Marcel. Jos looks at Benoît and the film ends.

<doc id="1290903" wikidata="Q7524640" url="?curid=1290903" title="Sinn Féin (newspaper)">
<text>Sinn Féin was a weekly Irish nationalist newspaper edited by the Dublin typesetter, journalist and political thinker Arthur Griffith. It was published by the Sinn Féin Printing &amp; Publishing Company Ltd. (SFPP) between 1906 and 1914, and replaced an earlier newspaper called the &quot;United Irishman&quot; which was liquidated after a libel suit. The SFPP brought out the &quot;Sinn Féin Daily&quot; in 1909 but had to abandon it when it plunged the company into enormous debt. The &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; weekly and the SFPP both came to an end when they were suppressed by the British Government in 1914.

==Form==
When the SFPP began to publish &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; in 1906 it was a large format (slightly larger than a modern broadsheet), 4-page newspaper with 7 columns per page.

==Graphic content==
Trained as he was in the graphic side of newspaper production, Arthur Griffith had both a professional interest in and a profound understanding of visual culture. An anonymous article on advertising in &quot;Leabhar na hÉireann&quot; (The Irish Yearbook), probably written by Grifith himself, explains the benefits of American-style advertising techniques for promoting Irish-made products. The use of typography and images is particularly praised: He was also very much aware of how visual discourses could be used to defend the Irish nation against cultural Anglicisation. In his newspaper propaganda he continually promoted the use of such discourses to develop a strong brand awareness for the Irish nation.

===Déanta i nÉirinn===
The most important graphic element of the &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; newspaper was the Déanta i nÉirinn symbol. This distinctive logo was created by the Irish Industrial Development Association (IIDA). The text in Irish means &quot;Made in Ireland&quot;. From the autumn of 1909, Griffith&#x27;s newspapers displayed it proudly and very prominently on their front page between the words &#x27;sinn&#x27; and &#x27;féin&#x27; in the title-piece. It could also frequently be seen in advertisements and cartoons throughout. Both a trade description and a statement of Sinn Féin&#x27;s industrial politics, this mark played a fundamental role in the newspaper propaganda published by the SFPP. Griffith felt it important to explain to his readers what the symbol meant in the context of Sinn Féinism and in relation to his newspaper:
Here Griffith blends Sinn Féin&#x27;s industrial politics (buy Irish, provide employment, stop emigration) with a sales pitch for the new &quot;Sinn Féin Daily&quot;. While promoting his own newspaper at the expense of his competitors, Griffith highlights the existence of a native ink-making and paper-making industry. Other newspapers which purport to promote the national cause fall into the category of spurious. Their alleged nationalism is therefore extremely questionable.In his 1917 book Francis P. Jones, an American friend of Griffith&#x27;s and historian of the early Sinn Féin movement explains the background to the creation of the trademark and the symbolism of its design. After outlining a major difficulty faced by Irish manufacturers, he describes the measures taken to protect them:
===Austin Molloy===
For the first few years of its existence the circulation of &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; was limited. From January 1909 onwards, however, Griffith attempted to attract new readers by publishing a daily newspaper with sensational articles from overseas, a fashion column aimed at women readers, and a new graphic approach. Thanks to the purchase of two brand new Linotype machines, the newspaper became more attractive from a typographical point of view and easier to read. The addition of images gave &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; a far less austere look and at the same time significantly improved its commercial appeal, with sales reaching a peak of 64,000 in September 1909. Foremost among these images were the large political cartoons which regularly appeared on the front page. This user-friendly graphic discourse translated the National question into a series of emotionally charged life and death struggles set against familiar mythical and literary backdrops. At the same time, it illustrated Griffith&#x27;s instructions to the individual Sinn Féiner, indicating the path to follow and the dangers to avoid.
The man responsible for these cartoons was the Dublin born designer, illustrator, and stained glass artisan Austin V. Molloy. At the age of twenty two Molloy was hired by the Sinn Féin Printing &amp; Publishing Company to provide cartoons at a rate of 1 shilling and 6 pence per week. His work appeared in the newspaper between August 1909 and April 1911. As was the case for many of the contributors to &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;, Molloy used the Irish version of his name, Maolmhuidhe, to sign his contributions. It is only by consulting the minutes of meetings of the board of directors of the newspaper company that we can identify him as the Austin Molloy who trained at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art between 1909 and 1916, at the same time as his more famous friend Harry Clarke. The art historian Theo Snoddy describes him as &#x27;the main follower&#x27; of Clarke at the school but, although his illustrations from the 1920s onwards are unmistakably influenced by the work of his friend, his earlier work, which includes his cartoons for Sinn Féin, reveals his debt to the principal book illustrators at the turn of the century, chief among them being Jack B. Yeats.
His cartoons provide us with a snapshot of the issues preoccupying Sinn Féin&#x27;s propagandists between 1909 and 1911, namely the status of the Irish language, the development of Irish industry and the prevention of emigration. Although his training was only beginning, Molloy was already sensitive to the religious and folk themes he would illustrate in books and windows and the character he chose to represent the ideal citizen of an independent Ireland was inspired by the iconography of Saint Patrick, the Virgin Mary, and The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress, and reflects the explicitly religious language of the Sinn Féin propagandist Robert Lynd.

==Textual content==
Through &quot;The United Irishman&quot; and &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; Griffith demonstrated the need to arrogate legislature from the hands of the British by transferring Irish Parliament back to Dublin. However, Irish Parliamentary parties quite clearly could not agree to Griffith&#x27;s urgings, as such a move would undermine the foundation of their existence in Westminster. &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; thus served as conduit for Griffith&#x27;s opposition to The Act of Union 1800.

<text>Tokyopop, originally named MixxZine, was a manga anthology published in North America by Tokyopop.

==History==
&quot;MixxZine&quot; at the start published five manga series, two of which were shōjo (geared towards young or teenaged girls) and two of which were seinen (geared towards adolescent boys/men):
*&quot;Harlem Beat&quot;
*&quot;Ice Blade&quot;
*&quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;
*&quot;Parasyte&quot;
*&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;

&quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was taken out of the anthology and moved to &quot;Smile&quot;, as the seinen and shōjo content were hard to reconcile due to the vast difference in audiences, and as Mixx wanted to refocus the magazine towards high school and university/college-aged readers which focused more on shōjo titles.

When &quot;MixxZine&quot; was renamed Tokyopop in July 1999, the focus changed towards more information on Asian culture, along with manga and articles on J-pop, video games, and anime. The magazine was offered for free, and only a few manga titles were published in the magazine, rotating through the following titles:
* &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; 
* &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Blue Destiny&quot;
* &quot;Parasyte&quot;
* &quot;Sorcerer Hunters&quot;
&quot;Tokyopop&quot; was eventually discontinued in August 2000.

<doc id="1290917" wikidata="Q5125312" url="?curid=1290917" title="Claire Skinner">
<text>Claire Skinner (born 1965) is an English actress, known in the United Kingdom for her television career, particularly playing Sue Brockman from the BBC television series &quot;Outnumbered&quot;. She is also known for her collaboration with director Mike Leigh on two of his films, &quot;Life is Sweet&quot; (1990) and &quot;Naked&quot; (1993).

==Early life==
Claire Skinner was born and brought up in Hemel Hempstead, the youngest daughter of a shopkeeper and an Irish-born secretary, and was shy as a child. Her dream was to be an actress and she immersed herself in her ambition. She acted, neglecting school work at Cavendish School, and &quot;barely scraped through [her] A-levels&quot;. She went on to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and then joined the Royal Shakespeare Company.

==Career==
Her first role was in &quot;Hanky Park&quot;, by Walter Greenwood at the Oldham Repertory Theatre, which she describes as a &quot;really traditional start&quot;. She is best known as Clare on the British television comedy &quot;Life Begins&quot; and as Lucinda, the sous chef in the first series of &quot;Chef!&quot; alongside Lenny Henry. From 2007 to 2016, she portrayed Sue Brockman in the sitcom &quot;Outnumbered&quot;. Skinner reprised her role in a one-off special that aired at Christmas 2024. For many years, she has preferred theatre to screen roles because she has been disappointed with her TV projects (&quot;apart from Mike Leigh&#x27;s stuff&quot;), &quot;not just when you see the final thing, but also because it hasn&#x27;t taken off.&quot;

Skinner has worked with directors including Mike Leigh – in &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;, and &quot;Naked&quot; – Trevor Nunn, Tim Burton and Sam Mendes, but according to her, Alan Ayckbourn &quot;was a great influence for me as he pushed me so hard, but every director you work with has a big influence in some way, they really push you.&quot;

She has made appearances in TV shows such as &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot; where for two episodes she played Mrs Macey. She appeared in the 2011 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special &quot;The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe&quot;.

In 2019, she played Sheila in &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;, which ran in Trafalgar Studios in the West End from September to November.

==Personal life==
Skinner was previously married to director Charles Palmer, with whom she has two sons. Her marriage to Palmer ended in 2016. She is now in a relationship with &quot;Outnumbered&quot; co-star Hugh Dennis.

<text>The United Irishman was an Irish nationalist newspaper co-founded by Arthur Griffith and William Rooney. It was first published on 4 March 1899 and ran from 1899 to 1906. Contributors included Oliver St. John Gogarty, Pádraig Pearse, Maud Gonne and Roger Casement. The writer James Joyce is quoted as saying that the &quot;United Irishman&quot; was &quot;the only newspaper of pretensions in Ireland&quot;. In 1906 the &quot;United Irishman&quot; collapsed under a libel suit and was refounded as &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;, which ran until 1914 when it was suppressed by the British government.

<doc id="1290943" wikidata="Q56651" url="?curid=1290943" title="Rushlight">
<text>A rushlight is a type of candle or miniature torch formed by soaking the dried pith of the rush plant in fat or grease. For several centuries, rushlights were a common source of artificial light for poor people throughout the British Isles. They were extremely inexpensive to make. English essayist William Cobbett wrote, &quot;This rushlight cost almost nothing to produce and was believed to give a better light than some poorly dipped candles.&quot;

One of the earliest printed descriptions of rushlights was written by English antiquary John Aubrey in 1673. Rev. Gilbert White gave a detailed description of rushlight making in &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;, Letter XXVI (1789). Rushlights were still used in rural England to the end of the 19th century, and they had a temporary revival during World War II. In parts of Wales the use of rushlights continued into the middle of the 20th century.

It is not clear whether rushlights were ever popular in the United States and Canada. Antique rushlight holders are occasionally found in North America, but most were probably imported from England; &quot;none are known to bear the mark of an American smith.&quot; In New England, &quot;rushlights were used little if at all in colonial days.&quot;

Rushlights should not be confused with rush-candles, although the latter word is attested for the same thing earlier in the 1590s. A rush-candle is an ordinary candle (a block or cylinder of tallow or wax) that uses a piece of rush as a wick. Rushlights, by contrast, are strips of plant fibre impregnated with tallow or grease. The wick is not separate from the fuel in a rushlight.

==Preparation==
Mature rush stalks are gathered in summer or autumn. The green epidermis or rind of each stalk is carefully peeled off to reveal the inner pith, but a single lengthwise strip of rind is left in place to provide support for the fragile pith. After drying, the rush is then steeped in any available household fat or grease. Bacon grease was commonly used, but mutton fat was considered best by some, partly because it dried to a harder, less messy texture than other fats. A small amount of beeswax added to the grease would cause the rush to burn longer. On more remote Atlantic islands such as St Kilda the stomach oil produced by fulmars was used.

==Duration and quality of light==
Sources give varying accounts of the length and burn-time of the average rushlight. &quot;The book of trades, or Library of the useful arts&quot; indicates that the average rushlight was 12 inches (30 cm) long and burned for 10 to 15 minutes. Gilbert White reported that a rushlight 28.5 inches (72 cm) in length burned for 57 minutes; he wrote, &quot;these rushes give a good clear light.&quot; There was much variation in the quality of rushlights; a 19th-century writer observed that &quot;one might very well flicker and splutter for an hour, whilst a second was just as likely to flame away in ten minutes.&quot;

A differently made rushlight in which two strips of the rind were left on the rush before it was coated with tallow produced a dimmer light but burned much longer. White referred to these as &quot;watchlights&quot;.

== Fixtures ==

The burning rushlight was normally held by metal clips at an angle of about 45 degrees. If the rush is held vertically, it tends to have a dimmer flame. If held horizontally, it may burn too quickly. However, there were some devices designed to keep the burning rush in a vertical position, including nightlights made from cylinders of tin or sheet-iron perforated with holes that would allow the light to shine out.

The rushlight holder was usually mounted on an iron tripod or a wooden block. Antique rushlight holders are now collectors&#x27; items. They were never mass-produced but were individually made by local craftsmen and blacksmiths.

==In literature and culture==

One of Aesop&#x27;s Fables, known in English as &quot;the farthing rushlight&quot; or &quot;the vain rushlight,&quot; describes a personified rushlight bragging that it is more brilliant than the sun, moon, and stars. The rushlight is then blown out by a slight breeze. The person who re-lights the rushlight advises it to be more humble.

Several magazines are named after rushlights. &quot;Rushlight&quot; is a literary and visual arts journal founded in 1855 by Lucy Larcom and published by Wheaton College (Massachusetts). &quot;The Rushlight&quot; is a quarterly newsletter of the International Association of Collectors and Students of Historic Lighting. &quot;Rushlight (The Belfast Magazine)&quot; is a journal of Belfast history and folklore founded by Joe Graham.

The name &quot;Rushlite&quot; was used during and for a while after World War II as a trademark of J. V. Rushton of Wolverhampton. &quot;During the war Mr Rushton started to sell his own Rushlite Batteries through Halfords shop.&quot;

<text>Asia Motors Industries, traded as Asia Motors (, ), was a South Korean car manufacturer established in 1965 and closed in 1999. From 1976 onwards, it was a subsidiary of Kia Motors.

==History== 

In 1962, as one of the measures to comply its First Five-Year Economic Development Plan, the Korean government passed a law exempting from taxes imported parts to assemble KD cars locally. In 1965, as a result of these incentives, Asia Motor Industries was established in Gwangju through the financial support of entrepreneur Lee Mun-hwan. The company was initially manufacturing military vehicles, trucks and buses but soon it began negotiations with Fiat and in 1970 it started to assemble Fiat 124 models. It diversified into the SUV and heavy vehicles market, including large and medium duty trucks, special military vehicles, lightweight cars, civilian jeeps (a small jeep look-alike called the Rocsta and later the Retona), motor vehicle components, to include engines, and buses and mini-buses. In 1969, Asia Motors was acquired by Dongkuk Steel. In 1973, the South Korean government launched a plan to promote the production of low-cost cars for export. Asia Motors was unable to satisfy the plan&#x27;s conditions, losing its car assembly permits, and was purchased by Kia in 1976, as the government promised Kia, in exchange of doing so, a monopoly of the military vehicle production for South Korea. In 1978, Asia Motors signed an agreement with Hino Motors of Japan with the aim of achieving economies of scale for its low-volume products. Hyundai in turn purchased Kia and the Asia brand was discontinued in 1999. The Rocsta&#x27;s replacement, the Retona, was sold under the Kia brand.

===Failed Brazilian production===
In 1994, Asia Motors do Brasil, an independent importer of Asia vehicles, was established in Brazil. Asia Motors do Brasil achieved some sales success and, in 1996, it signed an agreement with the Brazilian government for building an assembly plant at Camaçari in exchange of tax exemptions for imported vehicles. The plant was never completed, and the unpaid taxes prevented Kia&#x27;s parent company Hyundai from building a factory in the country until 2012, when the Brazilian justice determined Hyundai was not bound to pay them, as it was not related to the importer. The first Hyundai owned factory in Brazil was opened in 2012 in Piracicaba, having produced only the HB20 (including the HB20S notchback and the off-road themed HB20X derivatives) and the Creta, while Kia vehicles for sale in Brazil are all imported from South Korea and Uruguay.

<text>James Armistead Lafayette (1748 or 1760 — 1830 or 1832) was an enslaved African American who served the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War under the Marquis de Lafayette, and later received a legislative emancipation. As a double agent, he reported the activities of Benedict Arnold after he had defected to the British, and of Lord Charles Cornwallis during the run-up to the siege of Yorktown. He fed the British false information while disclosing very accurate and detailed accounts to the Americans.

== Early life ==
James was born to an enslaved mother either in North Carolina or Virginia. He became the property of Colonel John Armistead of New Kent County, Virginia. Well before the Colonel&#x27;s death in 1779 he became the first slave owned by and personal manservant of Armistead&#x27;s son William. Most sources believe that he was born in 1748, though others put his birth around 1760. James&#x27; owner taught him to read and write.

==American Revolution==
His enslaver William Armistead was an ardent Patriot, and served as commissary for Virginia&#x27;s troops in the Revolutionary War. After his father died in 1779, he inherited stores and land, as well as James (who never used &quot;Armistead&quot; as his surname during his lifetime). When the conflict began in 1775, Virginia&#x27;s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, promised freedom to slaves who joined his forces. Instead, James volunteered for the Continental Army under General Lafayette. He worked for Lafayette as a courier, laborer, and spy. Posing as a runaway slave, James joined former Continental Army officer Benedict Arnold&#x27;s camp in Portsmouth, Virginia ostensibly as a spy for the British. This role allowed Armistead to gain Arnold&#x27;s confidence, in part by guiding British troops through local roads. &quot;The ex-slave, who later renamed himself James Armistead Lafayette in the general&#x27;s honor, served as a double agent against the British under the avowedly anti-slavery Lafayette.&quot;

After Arnold departed north in the spring of 1781, James remained in Virginia and continued his work at the camps of Lord Charles Cornwallis. Now employed by the British as a courier, James traveled between their camps and often overheard officers speak openly about their strategies. He prepared written reports, and delivered them to other American spies. In this way, he relayed much information about the British plans for troop deployment and their arms. His espionage was instrumental in helping American and French forces defeat the British during the siege of Yorktown.

== Legislative emancipation ==
Although Virginia enacted a manumission act in 1782 allowing for the freedom of any slave who had fought in the Revolutionary War, James Armistead remained the property of William Armistead. This was because the next year (1783) another law specifically freed only slaves who had been issued firearms (i.e. whose owners had used them as substitutes for army service). James had served as a spy, not a soldier, and did not carry a gun. Thus his first petition for emancipation was not passed even by a legislative committee before the session ended. However, James persisted and succeeded with the support of William Armistead – again in 1786 a member of the House of Delegates – and Lafayette&#x27;s personal 1784 testimonial as to James&#x27;s service. On January 9, 1787, Virginia&#x27;s governor signed James&#x27;s petition, which both houses of the assembly had passed. Virginia later compensated Armistead for James&#x27; manumission. Upon receiving his freedom, James added &quot;Lafayette&quot; (or &quot;Fayette&quot;) as his surname to honor the French general.

== Later life ==
James Lafayette acquired two parcels totaling about forty acres in New Kent County in 1816 and became a relatively wealthy farmer in the area with his (second) wife and several children (including a son). He also became a slaveowner.
 In 1818, Lafayette applied to Virginia&#x27;s legislature for a pension based on his Revolutionary War service. He eventually received $60 () for present relief and a $40 annual pension ($).

In 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette returned to the United States at the invitation of President James Monroe. He made a tour of all 24 states, during which huge crowds gathered to see him and he was feted as a hero. Lafayette visited Yorktown, as well as George Washington&#x27;s grave at Mount Vernon and also gave a speech to the Virginia General Assembly in Richmond. While in Richmond, he abruptly ordered his carriage stopped when he saw James in the crowd, and rushed to embrace him.

==Death and legacy==
Sources differ as to whether James A. Lafayette died in Baltimore or New Kent County in 1830 (the year he picked up his last pension payment), or in Virginia in 1832.

During his lifetime, James&#x27;s heroism was mentioned in a two-volume book of historical fiction by James E. Heath, &quot;Edge Hill: or the Family of the Fitz Royals.&quot;(1828) The French artist Jean-Baptiste Le Paon included a black servant in French livery in a portrait he painted of the Marquis de LaFayette in 1785, which some think was intended to represent this man. John Blennerhassett Martin painted his portrait about the time of Heath&#x27;s book, and distributed copies with the Marquis de LaFayette&#x27;s testimony concerning his service. Some believe a figure of James Lafayette may be on the Lafayette memorial dedicated in Prospect Park, in Brooklyn, New York in 1917. In 1997, Virginia erected a highway marker on the grounds of the historic New Kent County courthouse to recognize his service.

<text>The 1946 World Series was played in October 1946 between the St. Louis Cardinals (representing the National League) and the Boston Red Sox (representing the American League). This was the Red Sox&#x27;s first appearance in a World Series since their championship of .

In the eighth inning of Game 7, with the score 3–3, the Cardinals&#x27; Enos Slaughter opened the inning with a single but two batters failed to advance him. With two outs, Harry Walker walloped a hit over Johnny Pesky&#x27;s head into left-center field. As Leon Culberson chased it down, Slaughter started his &quot;mad dash&quot;. Pesky caught Culberson&#x27;s throw, turned and—perhaps surprised to see Slaughter headed for the plate—supposedly hesitated just a split second before throwing home. Roy Partee had to take a few steps up the third base line to catch Pesky&#x27;s toss, but Slaughter was safe without a play at the plate and Walker was credited with an RBI double. The Cardinals won the game and the Series in seven games, giving them their sixth championship.

Boston superstar Ted Williams played in the Series injured and was largely ineffective but refused to use his injury as an excuse. He hit only .200 in 25 at-bats with just one RBI in his only World Series appearance.

As the first World Series to be played after wartime travel restrictions had been lifted, it returned from the 3-4 format to the 2–3–2 format for home teams, which has been used since. It also saw the return of many prominent players from military service.

This was the first of eleven meetings between teams from Boston and St. Louis for a major professional sports championship. This would happen again in the World Series three more times (1967, 2004, 2013), along with four NBA Finals (1957, 1958, 1960, 1961), Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, and two Stanley Cup Finals (1970, 2019).

==Summary==

==Matchups==
===Game 1===

The Red Sox struck first in Game 1 when Pinky Higgins followed a hit-by-pitch and walk in the second with an RBI single off Howie Pollet. The Cardinals tied the game in the sixth when Red Schoendienst singled, moved to second on a ground out, and scored on Stan Musial&#x27;s double off Tex Hughson. They took the lead in the eighth when Whitey Kurowski singled with two outs and scored on Joe Garagiola&#x27;s double. Pollet was a strike away from closing the game when Tom McBride tied the game with an RBI single with two on. Rudy York hit a home run into the left field bleachers in the tenth to put the Red Sox up 3–2. Earl Johnson pitched two shutout innings to close to give Boston a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===


The Cardinals struck first in Game 2 when Del Rice hit a leadoff double in the third off Mickey Harris and scored on Harry Brecheen&#x27;s single. They added to their lead in the fifth with two unearned runs on Terry Moore&#x27;s RBI single with two on followed by Stan Musial&#x27;s groundout. Brecheen pitched a complete-game shutout as the Cardinals tied the series heading to Boston.

===Game 3===


In Game 3, Rudy York&#x27;s three-run home run in the first off Murry Dickson gave the Red Sox an early 3–0 lead. They added another run in the eighth off Ted Wilks when Red Schoendienst misplayed Hal Wagner&#x27;s ground ball with two on. Dave Ferriss pitched a complete-game shutout to give the Red Sox a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===


This is the only game in World Series history that three players on the same team (St. Louis) had four or more hits (Enos Slaughter, Whitey Kurowski and Joe Garagiola had four each). Red Sox outfielder Wally Moses got four hits as well and second baseman Bobby Doerr hit a two-run home run and would hit .409 in the Series.

Enos Slaughter&#x27;s lead-off home run in the second off Tex Hughson put the Cardinals up 1–0. Whitey Kurowski doubled and scored on Harry Walker&#x27;s single. Walker moved to third on an error before scoring on Marty Marion&#x27;s groundout. Next inning, Stan Musial&#x27;s two-run double extended the Cardinals&#x27; lead to 5–0. Jim Bagby relieved Hughson and allowed a two-out RBI single to Garagiola. The Red Sox got on the board in the fourth when Ted Williams singled off Red Munger and scored on Rudy York&#x27;s double, but the Cardinals got that run back in the fifth on back-to-back doubles by Enos Slaughter and Kurowski. Garagiolas&#x27;s RBI double in the seventh off Bill Zuber made it 8–1 Cardinals. Bobby Doerr hit a two-run home run in the eighth, but the Cardinals put the game out of reach in the ninth. Three straight singles to lead off made it 9–3 Cardinals. Mike Ryba relieved Mace Brown and allowed a two-run double to Marty Marion, then an error on Red Schoendienst&#x27;s ground ball scored the last run of the game. Munger pitched a complete game to tie the series for St. Louis.

===Game 5===

Ted Williams hit a RBI single, his only RBI of the whole Series, in the first off Howie Pollet. After the Cardinals tied the game in the second on Harry Walker&#x27;s RBI double after an error off Joe Dobson, Don Gutteridge&#x27;s RBI single off Al Brazle in the bottom of the inning put the Red Sox back up 2–1. Leon Culberson&#x27;s home run in the sixth made it 3–1 Red Sox. Next inning, after a double, strikeout and intentional walk, Pinky Higgins&#x27;s RBI double made it 4–1 Red Sox. After another intentional walk loaded the bases, shortstop Marty Marion&#x27;s errant throw to second on Roy Partee&#x27;s ground ball allowed two more runs to score. Dobson allowed a two-run single in the ninth to Harry Walker before retiring Marion to end the game and put the Red Sox one win away from the championship.

===Game 6===


St. Louis staved off elimination at home, chasing Boston starter Mickey Harris with a three-run third. With two on and one out, Terry Moore&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored the game&#x27;s first run. After a single, back-to-back RBI singles by Whitey Kurowski and Enos Slaughter made it 3–0 Cardinals. The Red Sox scored their only run of the game in the seventh when Rudy York hit a leadoff triple and scored on Bobby Doerr&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Marty Marion added an RBI double in the eighth off Earl Johnson to back Harry Brecheen&#x27;s second win of the Series.

===Game 7===


The Red Sox struck first in Game 7 on Dom DiMaggio&#x27;s sacrifice fly after two leadoff singles off Murry Dickson. The Cardinals tied the game in the second when Whitey Kurowski hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Harry Walker&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Dave Ferriss. In the fifth, Walker hit a leadoff single and scored on a double by Dickson, who scored on Red Schoendienst&#x27;s single. The Cardinals led 3–1 in the eighth inning when Dom DiMaggio tied the game with a two-run double but had to be removed from the game after severely pulling a hamstring and Leon Culberson took his position in the center field.

In the bottom of the frame, Enos Slaughter scored from first base on a play called the &quot;Mad Dash&quot;. From the dugout, Dom DiMaggio tried in vain to get the reserve Culberson to shade Walker properly. As the runner started, Walker lined the ball to left-center field. Culberson was out of position and slow to field the ball. As he threw a relay to shortstop Johnny Pesky, Slaughter rounded third base, ignored third base coach Mike González&#x27;s stop sign, and continued for home plate.

What exactly happened when Pesky turned around is still a matter of contention. Some claim that Pesky, assuming that Slaughter would not be running home, checked Walker at first base instead of immediately firing home. Some contend that Pesky was shocked to see Slaughter on his way to score and &quot;held the ball,&quot; a mental lapse. But Pesky&#x27;s reaction after taking the throw is immaterial. The run was lost by a chain of unfortunate events: Dom DiMaggio pulling up injured; the Red Sox lacking a better defensive replacement than Leon Culberson; Culberson being out of position on Walker&#x27;s hit; Culberson&#x27;s slow pickup of the ball, complicated by a rough outfield surface, and Culberson&#x27;s weak throw; and Slaughter&#x27;s speed and aggressive base-running. Slaughter scored just as Red Sox catcher Roy Partee caught Pesky&#x27;s relay up the line from home plate.

The run put the Cardinals ahead 4–3 and proved to be the winning run. Harry &quot;The Cat&quot; Brecheen had come out of the bullpen during Boston&#x27;s rally in the eighth when the Red Sox had two men on base, and he gave up the double by DiMaggio that tied the game. Brecheen allowed two singles to start the ninth inning, but then retired the Red Sox without giving up a run, to record his third victory of the Series.

==Highlights==
*This was the first World Series appearance for the Red Sox since , and it would be their last appearance until , when they would again lose to the Cardinals in seven games. However, the Red Sox would win the next two World Series matchups with the Cardinals, sweeping them in to break an 86-year championship drought, and then defeating them in six games in (Boston&#x27;s third in ten years).
*The World Series loss snapped the Red Sox&#x27;s record of winning their first five postseason series, a feat that would not be matched until the Florida Marlins did it 57 years later in the 2003 National League Championship Series.
*Joe Cronin became the fourth manager to take two teams to the World Series (Pat Moran, Bill McKechnie, and Joe McCarthy were the first three) but was the first who did not win with either of them.
*This was the final World Series in which only four umpires were used.
* Several sources erroneously reported that Harry Walker hit a single allowing Enos Slaughter to score. It was officially scored a double.
*This was the first World Series in which the final out in Game 7 came with the tying run on third base.

<doc id="1290968" wikidata="Q458733" url="?curid=1290968" title="David Zvi Hoffmann">
<text>David Zvi Hoffmann (November 24, 1843, Verbó, Austrian Empire – November 20, 1921, Berlin) (), was an Orthodox Rabbi and Torah Scholar. He headed the Yeshiva in Berlin, and published a research on the Pentateuch and Mishna, both in reaction to erstwhile Biblical criticism.
He is referred to as רד&quot;צ הופמן - &quot;Radatz Hoffmann&quot; - in later Rabbinic writing.

He was an expert in Midrash halakha and the foremost halakhic authority in Germany in his generation.

He is well known for his strident literary opposition to the Graf-Wellhausen theories of Biblical origin, while he quotes prominent Wissenschaft figures in his researches on Mishnah and Talmud.

His commentary on the Pentateuch is still often referred to.

==Education and career==
Born in Verbó in 1843, he attended various Yeshivas in his native town before he entered the college at Pressburg, from which he graduated in 1865. He then studied philosophy, history, and Oriental languages at Vienna and Berlin, taking his doctor&#x27;s degree in 1871 from the University of Tübingen. His rabbinical training was under Moshe Schick and Azriel Hildesheimer.

Shortly after obtaining his degree, he became employed as a teacher in Samson Raphael Hirsch&#x27;s &quot;Realschule&quot; school in Frankfurt am Main, and in 1873 moved to Berlin to join the faculty of the Rabbinical Seminary of Berlin where he eventually became rector (Rosh Yeshiva) in 1899 after the death of Azriel Hildesheimer.

==A selective &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; practitioner==
David Hoffmann is in some ways the prototype of the contemporary Orthodox Jewish scholar, facing the ubiquitous tension between faithfulness to tradition and the demands of critical inquiry. Though born in Hungary, he adapted the German-Jewish approach of openness towards general culture, world and society. 

He employed the critical scientific method to the Talmud and wrote about the history of the development of the form of the Oral law (as opposed to the development of the Law itself, the latter being an enterprise antithetical to traditional Jewish beliefs; see below). Despite this, he was an original member of the more traditionally oriented &quot;Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah&quot; (council of great Torah sages), and was also known to be &quot;of great moral conduct and piety&quot;.

Hoffman was the leading authority on traditional &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) in Germany in his lifetime, as well as an expert in the area of &quot;midrash halakha&quot; (legalistic Biblical exegesis). 
He was also known for his efforts to disprove the Documentary Hypothesis, as expressed by the Graf-Wellhausen theory, with his arguments presented in the work &quot;Die wichtigsten Instanzen gegen die Graf-Wellhausensche Hypothese&quot; (1903/1916). 

A. Altmann, however, sees Hoffmann&#x27;s writings on these matters (though evidencing great expertise) as pure apologetics, the cause of which may be seen as laid out in his introduction to Leviticus , where Hoffmann makes the following remarks:
 
Yet, despite the piety of the above sentiments, and his repeated proclamations regarding the divinity of the Oral Law, Hoffmann was still very much the &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; scholar. He cites in his work scholars such as Z. Frankel, A. Geiger, S.J. Rapoport, and H. Graetz, he studies the influences of Ancient Near Eastern culture on the evolution of the Talmud, and he identifies problems in the transmitted text. For example, Hoffmann in &quot;The First Mishna&quot; (discussed below) sees the present Mishna Avot as having been redacted from three different sources, a Mishna of Rabbi Akiva, a Mishna of Rabbi Meir, and a Mishna of Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi, the originals of which cannot be completely reconstructed due to their thoroughgoing fusion and subsequent manipulation.

The extent to which Hoffmann resided in the &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; movement can also be seen from the criticism he received from such opponents of the movement as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hildesheimer notes regarding Hirsch&#x27;s opinion of his Rabbinical Seminary (where Hoffmann worked after leaving Hirsch&#x27;s institution) that &quot;a question certainly exists as to whether Rabbi Hirsch considers the seminary to be an Orthodox institution.&quot; Hirsch&#x27;s opposition extended to Hoffmann&#x27;s own work, judging Hoffmann&#x27;s book &quot;Mar Samuel&quot; to contain heresies .

Hoffmann&#x27;s resolution of this tension between faithfulness to tradition and textual criticism is found by in the following passage from the introduction to &quot;The First Mishna&quot;:

==Writings==
Hoffman produced the &quot;Die Erste Mishna&quot; (The First Mishna), mentioned above, a historical and linguistic analysis of the Mishnah.
&quot;Die Erste Mishna&quot; posits an early, uniform, undisputed, and therefore authoritative collection of the Oral Law, attempting to understand the historical development of the Mishnah from within itself and from rabbinic and non-rabbinic sources related to it.
In this and the below work, Hoffmann draws on his expertise in midrash halakha and Semitic languages.
For further context, see .

His commentary on the Pentateuch that included a translation of the text into German, is still widely cited. In it, he addresses erstwhile biblical criticism, particularly questions of God’s names and of the Torah’s antiquity. 
The work began as a series of lectures which he gave in the Rabbinical Seminary.
Originally, commentaries on Genesis, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy were published, starting in 1904; his commentary on Exodus was published by Mossad Harav Kook only in 2010. 
The commentaries on Leviticus and Deuteronomy were written by Radatz himself, 
while the commentaries on Genesis and Exodus were written by his students, based on manuscripts of his lectures.
Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Melamed Le-ho&#x27;il&quot;, are responsa on then contemporary issues, as based on historical evidence of tradition. He also published a translation of two of the orders of the Mishna into German.

Most of his writings were in German and remain so to this day. &quot;The First Mishna&quot; was translated into English, and a selection of his comments on the Passover Haggada have been published in Hebrew as well. His Pentateuch commentary was later translated into Hebrew; though today some volumes are out of print. Sefer Shemos has been recently reprinted; other volumes are available online.

<text>Canadarago Lake is a lake located in Otsego County, New York and is the source of Oaks Creek. The Village of Richfield Springs is located at the lake&#x27;s northern end. It is the second largest lake in Otsego County, lying to the west of and parallel to the larger Otsego Lake. The lake&#x27;s name is also spelled &quot;Candajarago Lake&quot; or &quot;Caniadaraga Lake&quot;.

The lake has two islands. One island is known as Deowongo Island. The island&#x27;s name is said to mean, &quot;Place of Hearing&quot;, coming from the Oneida Iroquois nation’s language, and was given to the island because of the echo that was noticeable from that body of land. The island was protected in October 2012 and is currently open for public access. The other island is Loon Island which is a sunken island that disappeared in the early 19th century.

== Geography ==

Canadarago Lake is just over long with a surface area of . Its average depth is , with a maximum depth of . The northern end of the lake is in the Town of Richfield, and the southern end is in the Town of Otsego and bordered by the Town of Exeter on the west. The lake runs from the Village of Richfield Springs at the north end to the community of Schuyler Lake at the south end. The lake has historically also been known as &quot;Schuyler Lake&quot;, and the community mentioned earlier still bears this name.

===Islands===

There is a small island near the eastern shore called Deowongo Island. There is a sunken island on Canadarago Lake called Loon Island. This island was less than an acre and stood toward the north end of the lake toward the northwest side, near the Baker’s Beach area.

=== Adjacent mountains ===
One mountain near the lake is Nine Hill, which is located on the northwest side of the lake. &quot;King Hill&quot; is located on the east side of the lake. South of King Hill is Panther Mountain.

== History ==

In 1778, there was an event known as the Andrustown Massacre during the American Revolutionary War near Canadarago Lake. There is a marker south of Hendersonville on the road to the lake known as the “Leatherstocking Trail”, which is a reminder of this massacre.

Until the early part of the 19th century, there was a second island on the lake called Loon Island. Smaller than the island that remains on Canadarago today, Loon Island was only half an acre in size. Its southern shore was marshy, but the northern end of the island (toward Richfield Springs) had trees and vegetation. In 1816...&quot;the year without a summer&quot;, there was an early spring thaw and the streams that feed Canadarago were running high. Their water flow covered the lake ice. A north wind blew the ice pack into the southern portion of the lake. Not long after that, there was a hard freeze and the winds shifted from out of the south. The ice pack, larger than before, was sent back in the opposite direction. The saw effect took off the surface soil of the island and took down the trees and vegetation. It has been under water ever since.

In 1872, a small steamboat was launched on the lake as a pleasure craft.

The remaining island on Canadarago was called Deowongo Island (De-O-Won-Go) by the Oneida Indians who lived in the area. The name is said to mean, &quot;Place of Hearing&quot;, and was given to the island because of the echo that was noticeable from that body of land. The island was purchased from the State of New York by Daniel Wormer in 1850. Then in 2012 the island was donated by the Schoenlein family to the Otsego Land Trust making it accessible by the public.

In 1902, the Southern New York Railroad, an electric railroad, was opened south of Herkimer and Mohawk to Jordanville, Richfield Springs, Canadarago Lake, Cooperstown and Oneonta. There were two stops along the lake including Canadarago Park and The Lake House. Canadarago Park was located on the east shore about a mile south of The Lake House.

June 2006 saw massive flooding of its banks after record rainfall. Legislation to create a Canadarago Lake District was approved by the New York State Legislature in 2007 but was subsequently vetoed by Governor Eliot Spitzer.

==Geology==
It is geologically related to the Finger Lakes, as they were both carved by glaciers, but is not counted among them. One difference is that Canadarago Lake is situated at a higher elevation () than the Finger Lakes (approximately ). Another difference is the Finger Lakes are part of the Lake Ontario watershed, and Otsego is part of the Susquehanna River watershed.

Canadarago Lake is a dimictic lake surviving a previous glacial period. The lake is also eutrophic.

==Watershed==

Ocquionis Creek and Mink Creek feed into the lake from the north, and Hyder Creek feeds into the lake from the west as well as Herkimer Creek, which enters the lake close to where Oaks Creek drains the lake. Oaks Creek drains to the south through a bog, and then flows southward for roughly before flowing into the Susquehanna River.

The Canadarago Lake watershed covers approximately . It includes parts of the towns of Otsego, Springfield, Richfield, Exeter in Otsego County and towns of Columbia and Warren in Herkimer County. It is the headwaters of the drainage basin of the Susquehanna River which runs from Otsego Lake in Cooperstown to Havre de Grace where it flows into the Chesapeake Bay of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Conservation and management==
===Invasive species===
Zebra mussels were first introduced into the Great Lakes in the mid- to late-1980s from ballast discharged from freighters originating in the Black and Caspian Sea region of eastern Europe and western Asia. They first became established in Canadarago Lake since around 2000. They can outcompete and kill native unionid clams. They also disrupt the food web, destroy shoreline infrastructure and swimming areas. In Canadarago Lake, they are of particular concern due to the relatively large areas of suitable habitat, which increase their impact the lake.

===Pollution===
Incompletely treated sewage from Richfield Springs was historically dumped into Oquionis Creek and then flowed into the lake which caused algae blooms. Then in 1973, tertiary treatment was started which involved phosphorus removal by alum precipitation. Improvements were seen within a few years.

==Recreation==
===Fishing===
One of the lake’s biggest attractions is fishing. There are many species of fish in the lake including alewife, chain pickerel, common carp, cutlip minnow, golden shiner, satinfin shiner, bridle shiner, common shiner, blackchin shiner, spottail shiner, bluntnose minnow, eastern blacknose dace, longnose dace, rudd, creek chub, fallfish, pearl dace, white sucker, creek chubsucker, shorthead redhorse, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, banded killifish, rock bass, redbreast sunfish, pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie and tessellated darter, with tiger muskie, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, yellow perch, walleye, and brown trout being the most popular to fish. In recent years yellow perch and other fishing in this lake have deteriorated due to over introduction of small bait fish by NYSDEC. The lake is accessed by a State-owned hard-surface boat launch on the west side off State Route 28. The lake’s Walleye population is being supplemented with approximately 40,000 Walleyes four to five inches in length (NYS Department of Environmental Conservation). They are being supplemented annually through 2016, where they will be re-evaluated and most likely stocked once every two to three years. During the summer, there are multiple bass tournaments to show off who can catch the most impressive sized bass. Ice fishing is also permitted during the winter months.

There are different regulations for fishing on the lake including a catch limit and season. Black Bass season goes from December 1 to the third Saturday in June and there is a limit of 5 fish per day. The walleye season goes from the first Saturday in May to March 15. In 2017, the walleye harvest limit was raised from the statewide regulation to minimum size and 3 per day, as opposed to a minimum size and 5 per day in most other New York lakes. The special regulation will be kept for walleye until number of age 3 is improved. As for Yellow Perch, the season is open all year and a limit of 25 per day, as opposed to a limit of 50 on most other New York lakes. In recent years yellow perch and other fishing in this lake have deteriorated due to over introduction of small bait fish by NYSDEC.

===Public swimming areas===
Baker&#x27;s Beach is a public picnic area that is open 11am to 7pm from July 4 through August 30, with swimming permitted when a lifeguard is on duty. It is located on the northwest side of the lake, accessed by State Route 28.

<text>Cazenovia Lake () is located in Madison County, New York. It is located southeast of the city of Syracuse. The village of Cazenovia is located southeast of the lake.

==History==

The lake resides in a valley created by sub-glacial runoff during the recession of North American continental glaciers at the end of the last glacial period.

Prior to European settlement of the area, Cazenovia Lake was known to the Oneida as &quot;Owagehaga&quot; or &quot;Owahgenah&quot;, and to the Onondaga as &quot;Hohwahgeneh&quot;, all of which mean &quot;lake of the yellow perch&quot;. It was also previously known as &quot;Canaseraga Lake&quot;.

==Description==

Cazenovia Lake is roughly long and wide. It is at its deepest point. The lake&#x27;s elevation is at above sea level. It is drained from its southeast corner by a canal to Chittenango Creek, which then flows north over Chittenango Falls and eventually into Oneida Lake&#x27;s south shore in Bridgeport.

The lake contains largemouth and smallmouth bass, rock bass, chain pickerel, pumpkinseed, black crappie, bluegill, walleye, yellow perch, white sucker, and brown bullhead. The north end of the lake is swampy, making navigation with a motorboat difficult. The lake has been impacted by several invasive species, including Eurasian milfoil and zebra mussels.

Boating access for trailered boats is allowed by permit at Lakeside Park in the village of Cazenovia. An unofficial launch for canoes and kayaks is available at the undeveloped Helen L. McNitt State Park on the northeastern shore of the lake. Plans to improve the launch were announced in 2015.

<doc id="1290993" wikidata="Q7373944" url="?curid=1290993" title="Royal Citadel, Plymouth">
<text>The Royal Citadel in Plymouth, Devon, England, was built in the late 1660s to the design of Sir Bernard de Gomme. It is at the eastern end of Plymouth Hoe overlooking Plymouth Sound, and encompasses the site of the earlier fort that had been built in the time of Sir Francis Drake. The citadel site is a Scheduled Monument and many of the buildings within are Grade II Listed.

==History==

===Drake&#x27;s Fort===
In 1590, Sir Francis Drake was appointed to improve the defences of Plymouth. After setting up some temporary artillery batteries, Drake petitioned the Privy Council for the funds to build a fort on Plymouth Hoe that could dominate the Cattewater, the approach to Sutton Harbour, which at that time was the main port at Plymouth. By May 1592, Elizabeth I had decided that the fort could be funded by a tax on every hogshead of pilchards which was exported from Plymouth. Construction of the fort dragged on until 1596 and was only finished after the government had drafted in a further 500 labourers. The northern landward side of the fort was protected by two bastions and it enclosed the previously established batteries overlooking the Cattewater, and also the Fisher&#x27;s Nose Blockhouse, located on its south east corner, which dates from about 1540. A further blockhouse called Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Tower was built a short distance to the west of Fisher&#x27;s Nose.

===Design and construction of the Citadel===

During the Dutch Wars of 1664-67 King Charles II decided that it was necessary to realise the importance of Plymouth as a channel port. The original plan was to build a regular self-contained fort with five bastions, to the west of Drake&#x27;s Fort, but this was revised to take in the earlier fort, resulting in the Citadel&#x27;s irregular outline. Possibly due to Plymouth&#x27;s support for the Parliamentarians in the Civil War its guns could also fire on the town. De Gomme faced some criticism over his unorthodox design: for instance when Samuel Pepys visited in 1683 he wrote that &quot;De Gomme hath built very sillily&quot;.

Work began in March 1665, but it was not until 18 July 1666 that the foundation stone was laid by John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath. This stone, inscribed &#x27;Jo Earle of Bathe 1666&#x27;, is still in the wall facing the Hoe. Elements from the earlier Tudor fort were incorporated into the new work. The Citadel is built of local limestone, while the English Baroque gateway, designed by Sir Thomas Fitz, is of Portland stone. The gateway was originally approached by a drawbridge over a dry moat, but these were removed with all the other outworks in the 1880s. On the opposite bank to Fisher&#x27;s Nose is the Queen Anne&#x27;s Battery, dating from 1667.

===Later use===

The Royal Citadel was the most important English defence for over 100 years, with 70 ft high walls, and was regularly strengthened over the years, particularly during the 1750s when it was equipped with 113 guns. In 1860, the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom recommended the construction of a new ring of forts to defend Plymouth from a greater distance, the &quot;Palmerston Forts&quot;; however, the Citadel was still judged to be &#x27;...a valuable support to the works on the right of the &quot;North-Eastern Defences&quot;.&#x27; During the later Victorian period the Citadel was being used by the Royal Garrison Artillery for instruction.

During the Second World War, the Citadel was used as the headquarters of the Coast Artillery Training Centre, Plymouth. After the war, the Coast Artillery School moved there from Great Orme, and the two institutions merged with the one remaining regular coast artillery regiment (47th Coast Regiment), which relocated to Plymouth from Dover to provide a depot establishment for the new Training Centre; training of recruits and others continued until the Coast Artillery was disbanded in 1956.

The Royal Citadel is still occupied by the military, being the base of 29 Commando Regiment of the Royal Artillery. This specialist British Army unit provides artillery support to the UK Commando Force. Guided tours are sometimes available.

Immediately to the east of the Citadel, and contemporary with it, a Royal Navy Victualling Yard was established to serve the fleet in Plymouth Sound and Sutton Pool. This closed with the establishment of the Royal William Victualling Yard in the 1830s, since when the area has been used as an extension to the military base (and accommodates vehicles too large to pass through the seventeenth-century gateway).

== Based units ==
The following notable units are based at Royal Citadel.

=== British Army ===
Royal Artillery

* UK Commando Force
** 29th Commando Regiment

== Future ==
&quot;A Better Defence Estate&quot;, published in November 2016, indicates that the Ministry of Defence will dispose of the Royal Citadel by 2024. This was later extended to 2035.

==Garrison church==

The Royal Chapel of St Katherine-upon-the-Hoe was originally licensed for services in 1371. During the period 1666–1671, the original church was demolished and the present nave, chancel and sanctuary were rebuilt on the same site. The galleries and transepts were added in 1845 and give a cross-like structure to the building. King George V re-granted the title &quot;Royal Chapel&quot; in 1927 during a visit to the Royal Citadel.

==Royal Citadel in the media==
The 2011 BBC television series &quot;The Choir: Military Wives&quot; featured the Royal Citadel along with RMB Chivenor in Devon. The programme documented choirmaster Gareth Malone forming a choir of wives and partners of Royal Citadel personnel deployed on active service in the Afghanistan War. In forming a choir, Malone aimed to raise the women&#x27;s morale and raise their profile in the public perception. The song &quot;Wherever You Are&quot; was recorded by the Military Wives Choir and was the Christmas number one in 2011, with proceeds going to the Royal British Legion and SSAFA Forces Help.

==Visitor access==
Access to the Royal Citadel is by guided tour only.

<text>The Clavinova is a long-running line of digital pianos created by the Yamaha Corporation. The name is a portmanteau of the two words &quot;Clavier&quot; meaning &#x27;keyboard instrument” and &quot;nova&quot; meaning “new”.

It is similar in function to an acoustic piano but also includes many features common to various electronic keyboards, such as the ability to save/load songs and to play demo songs, including original Yamaha compositions, and the ability to play in a variety of voices. More recent models can be connected to a computer via USB or wireless network for music production or interactive piano lesson programs.

In 2023, the Clavinova celebrated the 40th anniversary of its debut in 1983.

==Technical information==
All current (and many past) Clavinovas (CLP and CVP-Series) feature Yamaha&#x27;s “Graded Hammer” technology, a mechanical system of small metal hammers, weighted to be similar to those of an acoustic piano. These then activate a digital pressure sensor that then translates into sound. The graded action is intended to reproduce more accurately the varying weights of the hammers of an acoustic piano where the hammers vary in weight from the bass section to the treble. Higher-end models, such as the CVP-600 Series from 2012, incorporate real wooden keys and linear grading for added realism.
The built-in synthesizer produces the sound. Early Clavinova models used FM synthesis. Later models use sample-based synthesis to produce the sound. Information comes in a MIDI or similar format either directly from the piano keyboard or a stored source (from within the piano or via a computer or external sequencer). The synthesizer can imitate a large array of acoustic instruments, electronic instruments and other sound effects. Recent models of CVP Clavinova have hundreds of such voices. These usually include many types of pianos and organs, string, percussion, brass and woodwind instruments, as well as modern and vintage synthesizer sounds, sampled effects etc. The more recent CVP models also feature many accompaniment styles, ranging from traditional dance and classical orchestration to more modern club, pop, rock, big band and jazz styles.

As of July 2020, the current line of Clavinova CLP models is the CLP-700 series, and the current Clavinova CVP models are the CVP-800 series. In August 2017, Yamaha introduced a new line of tablet computer-enabled Clavinovas, the CSP series, which is designed for use with Yamaha&#x27;s SmartPianist app to access and control features of the instrument.

==Graded hammer==
The various &quot;graded&quot; or progressively &quot;weighted&quot; keys are:

* &quot;Graded Hammer Standard&quot; (GHS), formerly &quot;Hammer Effect&quot; (HE) or &quot;Action Effect&quot; (AE)
* &quot;Graded Hammer&quot; (GH or sometimes GHE), somewhat heavier than GHS. GH is also closer to the weight of real piano keys.
* &quot;Graded Hammer 3&quot; (GH3), like GH, but GH3 incorporate a third sensor, thus making the key respond more like &quot;grand piano&quot; behaviour. GH3 allows the player to trigger the sound when depressed a second time, even when the note is still decaying, and the player has not completely released the key after the first push of the key. This makes some techniques such as a soft legato &quot;trill&quot; easier to execute.
* &quot;Graded Hammer 3X&quot; (GH3X) keyboard features an &quot;escapement&quot; mechanism that reproduces a slight clicking sensation near the bottom of the key travel. It has been designed in such a way that the click is discernible only on the lightest keystrokes, similar to the keyboard of a grand piano.
* &quot;Natural Wood&quot; (NW) is graded like the GH3 but also uses spruce wood to make the feeling even closer to that of the acoustic grand piano.
* &quot;Natural Wood X&quot; (NWX) provides the keys of the NW keyboard, yet also has escapement, giving an even more accurate feel.
* &quot;GrandTouch Keyboard&quot; has a longer key length. The longer distance between the edge of the key and its pivot point means that it requires less strength to push down.
* &quot;88-key Linear Graded Hammers&quot; provide 88 levels of gradation (each key has its own weight). With NWX, it has the most accurate feel of any of the Clavinovas, although also found on some NW keyboards.

<doc id="1291003" wikidata="Q1434299" url="?curid=1291003" title="Internet Server Application Programming Interface">
<text>The Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) is an &quot;n&quot;-tier API of Internet Information Services (IIS), Microsoft&#x27;s collection of Windows-based web server services. The most prominent application of IIS and ISAPI is Microsoft&#x27;s web server. 

The ISAPI has also been implemented by Apache&#x27;s module so that server-side web applications written for Microsoft&#x27;s IIS can be used with Apache. Other third-party web servers like Zeus Web Server offer ISAPI interfaces, too.

Microsoft&#x27;s web server application software is called Internet Information Services, which is made up of a number of &quot;sub-applications&quot; and is very configurable. ASP.NET is one such slice of IIS, allowing a programmer to write web applications in their choice of programming language (VB.NET, C#, F#) that&#x27;s supported by the Microsoft .NET CLR. ISAPI is a much lower-level programming system, giving much better performance, at the expense of simplicity.

==ISAPI applications==
ISAPI consists of two components: Extensions and Filters. These are the only two types of applications that can be developed using ISAPI. Both Filters and Extensions must be compiled into DLL files which are then registered with IIS to be run on the web server.

ISAPI applications can be written using any language which allows the export of standard C functions, for instance C, C++, Delphi. There are a couple of libraries available which help to ease the development of ISAPI applications, and in Delphi Pascal the Intraweb components for web-application development. MFC includes classes for developing ISAPI applications. Additionally, there is the ATL Server technology which includes a C++ library dedicated to developing ISAPI applications.

===Extensions===
ISAPI Extensions are true applications that run on IIS. They have access to all of the functionality provided by IIS. ISAPI extensions are implemented as DLLs that are loaded into a process that is controlled by IIS. Clients can access ISAPI extensions in the same way they access a static HTML page. Certain file extensions or a complete folder or site can be mapped to be handled by an ISAPI extension.

===Filters===
ISAPI filters are used to modify or enhance the functionality provided by IIS. They always run on an IIS server and filter every request until they find one they need to process. Filters can be programmed to examine and modify both incoming and outgoing streams of data. Internally programmed and externally configured priorities determine in which order filters are called.

Filters are implemented as DLLs and can be registered on an IIS server on a site level or a global level (i.e., they apply to all sites on an IIS server). Filters are initialised when the worker process is started and listens to all requests to the site on which it is installed.

Common tasks performed by ISAPI filters include:
*Changing request data (URLs or headers) sent by the client
*Controlling which physical file gets mapped to the URL
*Controlling the user name and password used with anonymous or basic authentication
*Modifying or analyzing a request after authentication is complete
*Modifying a response going back to the client
*Running custom processing on &quot;access denied&quot; responses
*Running processing when a request is complete
*Run processing when a connection with the client is closed
*Performing special logging or traffic analysis.
*Performing custom authentication.
*Handling encryption and compression.

===Common ISAPI applications===
This is a list of common ISAPI applications implemented as ISAPI extensions:
* Active Server Pages (ASP), installed as standard
* ActiveVFP, Active Visual FoxPro installed on IIS
* ASP.NET, installed as standard on IIS 6.0 onwards
* ColdFusion, later versions of ColdFusion are installable on IIS
* Perl ISAPI (aka Perliis), available for free to install
* PHP, available for free to install, not maintained anymore.

==ISAPI development==
ISAPI applications can be developed using any development tool that can generate a Windows DLL. Wizards for generating ISAPI framework applications have been available in Microsoft development tools since Visual C++ 4.0.

<doc id="1291008" wikidata="Q7317321" url="?curid=1291008" title="Return to Peyton Place">
<text>Return to Peyton Place is a 1959 novel by Grace Metalious, a sequel to her best-selling 1956 novel &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

==Plot summary==
After the phenomenal success of her first novel, Metalious hastily penned a sequel centering on the life and loves of bestselling author Allison MacKenzie, who follows in the footsteps of her mother by having an affair with a married man, her publisher Lewis Jackman. The similarity of their situations bond Allison and her mother.

When she returns to her hometown following the publication of her first novel, &quot;Samuel&#x27;s Castle&quot;, she is forced to face the wrath of most of its residents, who are incensed by their barely disguised counterparts and the revelation of town secrets in the book. Despite that, certain members of the community stood by the MacKenzies, most notably, Seth Buswell, the newspaper editor; and his oldest friend, Dr. Matthew Swain. In fact, whenever anyone came into Dr. Swain&#x27;s office and complained about Allison&#x27;s book, he would roar them down and after a harsh tongue-lashing from him about some of the things that person had done, he or she would never complain about Allison&#x27;s novel after that.

However, Roberta Carter, a member of the school board (working in concert with the town attorney&#x27;s wife Marion Partridge), makes it her mission to ban the book from the high school library.

She punishes Allison by firing her stepfather, Michael Rossi (a decision which she eventually reverses, to the anger of Marion); while at the same time trying to dissolve her son Ted&#x27;s marriage to his snobbish bride, a Boston blue-blood named Jennifer Burbank.

Another union in trouble is that of Allison&#x27;s mother Constance, who is shocked by her daughter&#x27;s exposé, but nonetheless stands by her, and stepfather Michael Rossi, the school principal and one of the novel&#x27;s defenders.

Betty Anderson returns from New York, after giving birth to Roddy, the child she had by Rodney Harrington and, along with her cohort and Roddy&#x27;s babysitter, Agnes Carlisle, moves to Peyton Place, so she can allow Leslie, Roddy&#x27;s grandfather to know him.

Selena Cross, who had been acquitted of murder in the previous novel, was trying to make a life for herself and her brother, Joey. She is manager of the Thrifty Corner Apparel Shoppe, and is a success. In this book, Selena and Allison had rebonded as friends, and Allison&#x27;s New York roommate, Stephanie Wallace, was also part of their circle.

==Reception==
&quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; received harsh reviews; Edmund Fuller in the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;This sequel to &#x27;Peyton Place&#x27; has no interest as a novel... [I]t is foolish writing, cynical publishing and bad reading.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine said, &quot;[T]he sequel bears all the marks of a book whacked together on a long weekend... Return has little more scene-setting than a limerick, and the characterization is negligible.&quot;

Metalious herself held the work in poor esteem, believing herself pressured by Hollywood producer Jerry Wald to write the sequel. In a press conference she held in New York in December 1959, she said &quot;This isn&#x27;t a novel; it&#x27;s a Hollywood treatment... It was never intended to be anything else. It was a foul, rotten trick. They made a hell of a lot on Peyton Place, and they wanted to ride the gravy train.&quot;

Sales of the sequel did not approach those of the original book: While &quot;Peyton Place&quot; remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list for 76 weeks, &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; spent just three (non-consecutive) weeks on the list, peaking at #13. According to Metalious biographer Emily Toth, the paperback edition sold four million copies, which was half of what the first novel sold.

==Adaptations==
A 1961 film adaptation was directed by José Ferrer.

A daytime drama entitled &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; aired on NBC from April 3, 1972, to January 4, 1974, but the soap opera was a continuation of the primetime television series &quot;Peyton Place&quot; rather than an adaptation of the book.
