<text>The Public Interest (1965–2005) was a quarterly public policy journal founded by Daniel Bell and Irving Kristol, members of the loose New York intellectuals group, in 1965. It was a leading neoconservative journal on political economy and culture, aimed at a readership of journalists, scholars and policy makers.

==Overview==
Its content included the performance of the Great Society, the fate of social security, the character of Generation X, crime and punishment, love and courtship, the culture wars, the tax wars, the state of the underclass, and the salaries of the overclass. It eschewed foreign and defense policy.

The magazine published prominent writers and scholars including Seymour Martin Lipset, James Q. Wilson, Peter Drucker, Charles Murray, James S. Coleman, Anthony Downs, Aaron Wildavsky, Mancur Olson, Jr., Michael Novak, Samuel P. Huntington, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Martin Feldstein, Leon Kass, Irwin M. Stelzer, Daniel P. Moynihan, Nathan Glazer, Glenn C. Loury, Stephan Thernstrom, Abigail Thernstrom, Charles Krauthammer, Francis Fukuyama and David Brooks.

Editor Irving Kristol was the dominant personality, especially after Daniel Bell relocated to Harvard in 1969. Bell, troubled by what he perceived to be an excessively conservative slant, withdrew in 1973, and was replaced as co-editor by the sociologist Nathan Glazer. Kristol continued, and the magazine become known as the principal house organ of neoconservatism, a hostile label which Kristol embraced. The magazine&#x27;s sub-editors were considered apprentices, and were seeded into high journalism, academia, and government staff posts. Many policies advanced by the magazine were absorbed into the mainstream of public policy.

In 1988, the journal moved its offices from New York City to Washington, D.C. With foundation support flagging, Kristol aging, and no obvious successor, &quot;The Public Interest&quot; published its final issue in the spring of 2005. Towards the end, its readership had declined significantly. Kristol wrote on the history of the journal in his article &quot;Forty Good Years&quot; in the final issue.

<text>Based in Burlington, Ontario, TransUnion Canada is one of two credit reporting agencies in Canada. Like their main competitor, Equifax Canada, they now market their credit reports directly to consumers, in addition to their core business of providing the reports to potential creditors.

==Services==
Services offered by TransUnion Canada include:

* Disputes 
* Fraud 
* General 
* Score
* Consumer disclosures

==Legal==
In 2012 Consumer Protection B.C issued a compliance order against Trans Union to remove all data it held over 6 years. Trans Union refused to comply with the compliance order as it felt obligated to report &quot;substantiated facts&quot; longer than six years. TransUnion requested a review of the compliance order, which led to court action. The BC Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the compliance order was lawful.

<doc id="1274083" wikidata="Q257835" url="?curid=1274083" title="Irene Khan">
<text>Irene Zubaida Khan (born 24 December 1956) is a Bangladeshi British lawyer and human rights activist. She is serving as the United Nations Special Rapporteur for freedom of expression and opinion. She previously served as the seventh Secretary General of Amnesty International (from 2001 to 2009). In 2011, she was elected Director-General of the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) in Rome, an intergovernmental organization that works to promote the rule of law, and sustainable development. She was a consulting editor of &quot;The Daily Star&quot; in Bangladesh from 2010 to 2011.

==Early life==
Khan was born on 24 December 1956 in Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), though her ancestral home is in Birahimpur, Sylhet. She is the daughter of Sikander Ali Khan, a Bengali Muslim medical doctor; granddaughter of Ahmed Ali Khan, a Cambridge University mathematics graduate and barrister; and great-granddaughter of Assadar Ali Khan, the personal physician of Syed Hasan Imam. Her great-great-grandfather, Abid Khan, was the descendant of an Afghan migrant to Bengal. Her uncle, Rear Admiral Mahbub Ali Khan, was the chief of the Bangladesh Navy. She was the star pupil at St Francis Xavier&#x27;s Green Herald International School, 1964-1972 where she was the record holder at the school-leaving examinations.

During her childhood, East Pakistan became the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971 following the Bangladesh Liberation War. The genocide that occurred during the war helped shape the teenage Khan&#x27;s activist viewpoint. She left Bangladesh as a teenager for St. Louis Grammar school in Kikeel, Northern Ireland 1973–1975.

Khan went to England, where she studied law at the University of Manchester and then, in the United States, at Harvard Law School. She specialized in public international law and human rights.

==Career==
===Human rights===
Khan helped to create the organisation Concern Universal in 1977, an international development and emergency relief organisation. She began her career as a human rights activist with the International Commission of Jurists in 1979.

Khan went to work at the United Nations in 1980. She spent 20 years at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In 1995 she was appointed UNHCR India&#x27;s Chief of Mission, becoming the youngest UNHCR country representative at that time. After less than one year in New Delhi the Indian government requested that she be removed from that position. During the Kosovo crisis in 1999, Khan led the UNHCR team in the Republic of Macedonia for three months. This led to her being appointed as Deputy Director of International Protection later that year.

In August 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights appointed Khan to the position of Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion.

Irene Khan is currently the Chair of the Supervisory Board of BRAC International.

On January 23, 2024, Khan met with National Privacy Commission to examine the state of rights to freedom of opinion and expression in the Philippines.

In 2025 she visited Zambia for ten days following reports of politicians and journalists being arrested.

===Amnesty International===

Khan joined Amnesty International in 2001 as its Secretary General. In her first year of office, she reformed Amnesty&#x27;s response to human rights crises and launched the campaign to close the United States&#x27; Guantanamo Bay detention camp, which held suspected enemy combatants. In 2004 she initiated a global campaign to stop violence against women. In May 2009 Khan launched Amnesty&#x27;s &quot;Demand Dignity&quot; campaign to fight human rights abuses that impoverish people and keep them poor.

=== Rule of law ===
During her leadership of IDLO, Irene Khan has promoted the notion that the rule of law is an important tool that can advance equity and people-centered development, whether in reducing inequalities or fostering social justice and inclusion for peace.

==Other activities==
* Transparency International, Member of the Advisory Council
* Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Member of the Board (since 2010)

==Recognition==
===In media===
Khan is featured in a 2003 TV documentary titled &quot;Human Rights,&quot; by the French filmmaker Denis Delestrac. The film, shot in Colombia, Israel, Palestine and Pakistan, analyses how armed conflicts affect civilian communities and foster forced migration. In 2009 Khan was featured in &quot;Soldiers of Peace,&quot; an anti-war film.

===Awards===
* Khan received a Ford Foundation Fellowship in 1979.
* 2002, she received the Pilkington &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; Award as well as *2006, the Sydney Peace Prize.
* Since 2007, she has received several honorary doctorates, including from Ghent University, the University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), and Manchester, St. Andrews, Salford and Staffordshire, and Edinburgh in UK, American University of Beirut (Lebanon), Ferris University (Japan), SOAS and State University of New York (USA).

In 2008, she was one of the two finalists for the election of the new Chancellor of the University of Manchester. In July 2009, she was appointed as Chancellor of the University of Salford a post she held until January 2015.

In 2006 she was awarded the City of Sydney Peace Prize for &quot;her leadership as a courageous advocate of universal respect for human rights, and her skills in identifying violence against women as a massive injustice and therefore a priority in campaigning for peace.

== Controversies ==

===&quot;Gulag&quot; controversy===
In 2005, Irene Khan penned the introduction to that year&#x27;s Amnesty International report in which she, inter alia, referred to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay as &quot;the gulag of our time,&quot; accusing the United States of &quot;thumb[ing] its nose at the rule of law and human rights [as] it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity&quot;. Much backlash followed in the media. Michael Totten of &quot;World Affairs&quot; called her a &quot;hysterical heavy-breather&quot;. An editorial opinion in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; referred to it as &quot;[i]t is ALWAYS SAD when a solid, trustworthy institution loses its bearings and joins in the partisan fracas that nowadays passes for political discourse&quot;. John Podhoretz of the &quot;New York Post&quot; said that &quot;[t]he case of Amnesty International proves that well-meaning people can make morality their life&#x27;s work and still be little more than moral idiots.&quot; In his &quot;The United Nations, Peace and Security&quot;, Ramesh Thakur called Khan&#x27;s likening of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to a gulag a &quot;hyperbole&quot; that is &quot;wrong&quot;. A former Soviet prisoner of conscience, Pavel Litvinov, told the Amnesty International staffer, who called him to inquire on behalf of Khan whether it would be appropriate to use the word &#x27;gulag&#x27; in an Amnesty report and in relation in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, that there was &quot;an enormous difference&quot; between the gulags and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Roger Kimball of Arma Virumque called it &quot;a preposterous remark&quot;. The Bush administration responded to it in the following manner: President Bush called it &quot;an absurd allegation;&quot; Vice President Cheney said he was &quot;offended by it;&quot; Defense Secretary Rumsfeld called it &quot;reprehensible&quot; and &quot;those who make such outlandish charges los[ing] any claim to objectivity or seriousness&quot;. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Myers called it &quot;absolutely irresponsible&quot; The White House spokesman Scott McClellan called the characterization &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Anne Applebaum, the author of &quot;Gulag: A History&quot;, found this characterization &quot;infuriating,&quot; stating that &quot;Amnesty misus[ed] language [and] discard[ed] its former neutrality&quot; and that it &quot;attack[ed] the American government for the satisfaction of [the Amnesty&#x27;s] own political faction&quot;.

However, not everyone rallied against Khan&#x27;s &#x27;gulag&#x27; characterization. Retired US State Department officer Edmund McWilliams who monitored prisoner abuse committed in the Soviet Union and Vietnam stated the following in support of Khan&#x27;s characterization: &quot;I note that abuses that I reported on in those inhumane systems parallel abuses reported in Guantanamo, at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and at the Abu Ghriab prison: prisoners suspended from the ceiling and beaten to death; widespread &quot;waterboarding;&quot; prisoners &quot;disappeared&quot; to preclude monitoring by the International Committee of the Red Cross—and all with almost no senior-level accountability&quot;. Aryeh Neier stated that the criticisms of Khan&#x27;s statement were exaggerations and added, &quot;The flurry of attention to Irene Khan&#x27;s statement about the gulag probably contributed to a trend that had already been noted in prior years: namely, a decline in the organization&#x27;s prestige in the United States to a level below its very high standing in Europe.&quot;

===Pay controversy===
In February 2011, newspaper stories in the UK revealed that Khan had received a payment of £533,103 from Amnesty International following her resignation from the organization on 31 December 2009, a fact pointed to from Amnesty&#x27;s records for the 2009–2010 financial year. The sum paid to her was in excess of four times her annual salary of £132,490. The deputy secretary general, Kate Gilmore, who also resigned in December 2009, received an ex-gratia payment of £320,000. Peter Pack, the chairman of Amnesty&#x27;s International Executive Committee (IEC), initially stated on 19 February 2011: &quot;The payments to outgoing secretary general Irene Khan shown in the accounts of AI (Amnesty International) Ltd for the year ending 31 March 2010 include payments made as part of a confidential agreement between AI Ltd and Irene Khan&quot; and that &quot;It is a term of this agreement that no further comment on it will be made by either party.&quot;

The payment and AI&#x27;s initial response to its leakage to the press led to considerable outcry. Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, decried the payment, telling the &quot;Daily Express&quot;: &quot;I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they were subsidising a fat cat payout. This will disillusion many benefactors.&quot; On 21 February Peter Pack issued a further statement, in which he said that the payment was a &quot;unique situation&quot; that was &quot;in the best interest of Amnesty&#x27;s work&quot; and that there would be no repetition of it. He stated that &quot;the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again.&quot; Pack also stated that Amnesty was &quot;fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights&quot;. On 25 February, Pack issued a letter to Amnesty members and staff. In summary, it states that the IEC in 2008 had decided not to prolong Khan&#x27;s contract for a third term. In the following months, IEC discovered that due to British employment law, it had to choose between the three options of either offering Khan a third term, discontinuing her post and, in their judgement, risking legal consequences, or signing a confidential agreement and issuing a pay compensation.

Khan&#x27;s lawyers issued a letter published by the Charity Times &quot;It was not accurate of Amnesty International to record in its 2009/2010 corporate accounts that the amount £532,000 was paid to our client&quot;. The published letter detailed the sum as including: a) her salary and contractual benefits until 31 December 2009; b) outstanding back pay and the shortfall arising in her contractual benefits from previous years (in some part going back to 2005); relocation costs for her return abroad from where she had been recruited; d) compensation as well as severance payment (£115,000 gross) in respect of a legal claim and grievances that our client had asserted against Amnesty International Limited pursuant to her UK employment rights). Outgoing IEC Chairman Peter Pack, stated that paying off Khan was &quot;the least worst option&quot; available to IEC. The amount paid out to Khan and her deputy (who was also removed by IEC) amounted to 4% of Amnesty International&#x27;s budget that year. The organization was hurt by this scandal and by choosing to pay Khan to leave, with Chairman Pack promising to make amends and move the organization forward following Khan&#x27;s departure.

==Family==
Zubaida Rahman, the wife of politician Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is the cousin of Irene Khan. Irene Khan&#x27;s uncle Rear Admiral Mahbub Ali Khan was the Chief of the Naval Staff of Bangladesh during the regime of Ziaur Rahman.

<text>Basic Books is a book publisher founded in 1950 and located in New York City, now an imprint of Hachette Book Group. It publishes books in the fields of psychology, philosophy, economics, science, politics, sociology, current affairs, and history.

==History==
Basic Books originated as a small Greenwich Village-based book club marketed to psychoanalysts. Arthur Rosenthal took over the book club in 1950, and under his ownership it soon began producing original books, mostly in the behavioral sciences. Early successes included Ernest Jones&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud&quot;, as well as works by Claude Lévi-Strauss, Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson. Irving Kristol joined Basic Books in 1960, and helped Basic to expand into the social sciences. Harper &amp; Row purchased the company in 1969.

In 1997, HarperCollins announced that it would merge Basic Books into its trade publishing program, effectively closing the imprint and ending its publishing of serious academic books. That same year, Basic was purchased by the newly created Perseus Books Group. Perseus&#x27;s publishing business was acquired by Hachette Book Group in 2016. In 2018, Seal Press became an imprint of Basic.

<text>Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (24 March 1739 – 10 October 1791) was a German poet, organist, composer, and journalist. He was repeatedly punished for his social-critical writing and spent ten years in severe conditions in jail.

==Life==
Born at Obersontheim in Swabia, he entered the University of Erlangen in 1758 as a student of theology. He led a dissolute life, and after two years&#x27; stay was summoned home by his parents. After attempting to earn a livelihood as private tutor and as assistant preacher, his musical talents gained him the appointment of organist in Geislingen an der Steige. Meeting Schubart in Ludwigsburg in 1772, Charles Burney called him &quot;the first, real great harpsichord player that I had hitherto met with in Germany ... He is formed on the Bach school; but is an enthusiast, and original in genius. Many of his pieces are printed in Holland; they are full of taste and fire. He played on the Clavichord, with great delicacy and expression; his finger is brilliant, and fancy rich.&quot; Schubart was unappreciated in Ludwigsburg, according to Burney: &quot;The common people think him mad, and the rest overlook him.&quot; As a consequence of his wild life and blasphemy, found expressed in a parody of the litany, he was later expelled from the country.

He then visited in turn Heilbronn, Mannheim, Munich and Augsburg. In Augsburg, he made a considerable stay, began his &quot;&quot; (&quot;German Chronicle&quot;, 1774–1778) and eked out a subsistence by reciting from the latest works of prominent poets.

In 1775, Schubart witnessed a piano playing competition in Munich between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Ignaz von Beecke. He wrote in his Teutsche Chronik (27 April 1775) that in his opinion, von Beecke played far better than Mozart: &quot;In Munich... I heard two of the greatest clavier players, Mr Mozart and Captain von Beecke. Mozart’s playing had great weight, and he read at sight everything that we put before him. But no more than that; Beecke surpasses him by a long way. Winged agility, grace and melting sweetness.&quot;

Owing to a bitter attack upon the Jesuits, he was expelled from Augsburg and fled to Ulm, where he was arrested in 1777 and confined in the fortress of Hohenasperg.

Here he met with lenient treatment, and he spent the time by a study of mystical works and in composing poetry. His &quot;&quot; (&quot;Complete Poems&quot;) appeared in two volumes at Stuttgart in 1785/1786 (new edition by Gustav Hauff, Leipzig, 1884, in Reclams Universal-Bibliothek); in this collection most of the pieces are characterized by the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period. One of the poems he wrote there and published in the &quot;Schwäbischer Musen-Almanach&quot; in 1783 was &quot;Die Forelle&quot; (&quot;The Trout&quot;), set to music by Franz Schubert in 1817.

He was set free in 1787 by Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, and expressed his gratitude in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Hymn to Frederick the Great&quot;). Schubart was now appointed musical director and manager of the theatre at Stuttgart, where he continued his &#x27; and began his autobiography, &#x27; (&quot;Schubart&#x27;s Life and Thoughts&quot;, 2 vols, 1791–1793), but he died before its completion in Stuttgart. His &quot;&quot; (&quot;Collected Writings and Fates&quot;) appeared in 8 volumes (Stuttgart, 1839–1840).

Among Schubart&#x27;s musical works are the operetta &#x27;, the melodrama &#x27;, three books of &quot;&quot; (1786), a &quot;Salve Regina&quot;, and various songs and keyboard pieces.

<doc id="1274103" wikidata="Q6717641" url="?curid=1274103" title="MR 0-10-0 Lickey Banker">
<text>In 1919, the Midland Railway built a single 0-10-0 steam locomotive, No 2290 (later LMS (1947) 22290 and BR 58100). It was designed by James Anderson for banking duties on the Lickey Incline in Worcestershire (south of Birmingham), England. It became known as &quot;Big Bertha&quot; or &quot;Big Emma&quot; by railwaymen and railway enthusiasts.

==Banking on the Lickey Incline==

The Lickey Incline is the steepest sustained main-line railway incline in Great Britain. The function of a banker is to provide extra power on steep inclines by being added to the rear of other trains. Bankers were also used to protect against wagons or coaches breaking away, in which case they might run in front of a train going downhill. They largely went out of use with the introduction of advanced braking systems and diesel and electric locomotives, although banking on the Lickey Incline continues as of 2024 using a pool of specialised Class 66 diesel-electric locomotives.

==Numbering==
No 2290 was built at the Derby Works of the Midland Railway in 1919 and was in use up to the year 1956 by the LMS and British Railways. She was numbered 2290 from new and kept this number through most of her LMS life, but was renumbered to 22290 in 1947 to make room for the numbering of a Fairburn 2-6-4T. Only a year later it was renumbered to 58100 by BR, since adding 40000 to its number (as was done with the majority of LMS engines) would have put it in the 6XXXX ex-LNER series.

==Specification==
Big Bertha&#x27;s cylinder arrangement was unusual. There were four cylinders but only two sets of piston valves because there was insufficient space under the smokebox to fit piston valves for the inside cylinders. Instead, the large outside piston valves (as well as supplying the outside cylinders) supplied the inside cylinders through cross-over steam ports. The steam-flow characteristics would have been poor (because of the length of the ports) but this would not have mattered in an engine that ran only at slow speed. It has been suggested that this design has been influenced by the four-cylinder cross-ported arrangement of the Italian 0-10-0 FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotive (in which this was motivated by its being part of an asymmetrical compound design), of which a complete set of drawings were stored at Derby.

With a weight of and ten diameter driving wheels, Bertha had a tractive effort of . It, the LMS Garratts, and the LNER Class U1 Garratt were the only locomotives not given a power classification by either the LMS or BR, either because the bankers were designed specifically for the job of providing extra power at slow speeds and were not suitable for normal train working, or because their starting tractive effort fell outside the system and it was not worth extending it for so few machines.

==Withdrawal==
The engine was withdrawn on 19 May 1956 and scrapped by Derby Works in September 1957, having covered , mostly on the Lickey. BR Standard Class 9F number 92079 took over, acquiring Big Bertha&#x27;s electric headlight for the duty. The other banking turns on the Lickey were operated by Midland Railway 2441 Class, LMS Fowler Class 3F 0-6-0Ts, and GWR 9400 Class pannier tanks often in pairs, operation being controlled by a complicated system of whistle codes.

==See also==
* The LNER Class U1 Beyer-Garratt banker from the Woodhead Route was tried unsuccessfully on the Lickey in the mid-1950s.
* Several GWR 9400 Class pannier tank engines were used for banking after the Lickey Incline came under the control of the Western Region, along with BR Standard Class 9F number 92230, which ended up inheriting her headlamp.

<text>Christian McBride (born May 31, 1972) is an American jazz bassist, composer and arranger. He has appeared on more than 400 recordings as a sideman, and is a nine-time Grammy Award winner.

McBride has performed and recorded with a number of jazz musicians and ensembles, including Freddie Hubbard, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Joe Henderson, Diana Krall, Roy Haynes, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, Eddie Palmieri, Joshua Redman, and Ray Brown&#x27;s &quot;SuperBass&quot; with John Clayton, as well as with pop, hip-hop, soul and classical musicians like Sting, Paul McCartney, Celine Dion, Isaac Hayes, The Roots, Queen Latifah, Kathleen Battle, Renee Fleming, Carly Simon, Bruce Hornsby, and James Brown.

==Early life==
McBride was born in Philadelphia on May 31, 1972. After starting on bass guitar, McBride switched to double bass. He is a graduate of the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, and studied at the Juilliard School.

==Later life and career==

McBride was heralded as a teen prodigy when he joined saxophonist Bobby Watson&#x27;s group, Horizon, at the age of 17. From age 17 to 22, McBride played in the bands of older musicians such as Watson, Freddie Hubbard, Benny Golson, George Duke,
Milt Jackson, J. J. Johnson and Hank Jones, as well as his peers such as Roy Hargrove, Benny Green, and Joshua Redman. In 1992, jazz bassist Ray Brown formed a group called SuperBass with McBride and fellow Brown protégé John Clayton. The group released two albums: &quot;SuperBass: Live at Scullers&quot; (1997) and &quot;SuperBass 2: Live at the Blue Note&quot; (2001).

McBride was a member of saxophonist Joshua Redman&#x27;s Quartet in the early 1990s with pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Brian Blade. McBride began leading his own groups in 1995 after the release of his debut album &quot;Gettin&#x27; to It&quot; (Verve). Saxophonist Tim Warfield, pianists Charles Craig and Joey Calderazzo, and drummers Carl Allen and Greg Hutchinson are among the musicians who played in McBride&#x27;s early groups. From 2000 to 2008, McBride led his own ensemble, the Christian McBride Band, with saxophonist Ron Blake, pianist/keyboardist Geoffrey Keezer, and drummer Terreon Gully. The band released two albums: &quot;Vertical Vision&quot; (Warner Bros., 2003) and &quot;Live at Tonic&quot; (Ropeadope, 2006).

In 1996, McBride contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

McBride primarily plays double bass; however, he is equally adept on bass guitar. He played both on the album &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot;, which included keyboardist Uri Caine and hip-hop drummer Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson. Other projects have included tours and recordings with the Pat Metheny Trio, the Bruce Hornsby Trio, and Queen Latifah. Like Paul Chambers, McBride can solo by playing his bass arco style.

In 2006, McBride was named to the position of Creative Chair for Jazz with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, taking over from Dianne Reeves. He was signed to a two-year contract that was renewed for an additional two years. He was succeeded by Herbie Hancock in 2010.

McBride performed with Sonny Rollins and Roy Haynes at Carnegie Hall on September 18, 2007, in commemoration of Rollins&#x27; 50th anniversary of his first performance there. McBride was also tapped by CBS to be a producer for the tribute to Rollins on the 2011 Kennedy Center Honors broadcast.

In 2008, McBride joined John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, Kenny Garrett and Vinnie Colaiuta in a jazz fusion supergroup called the Five Peace Band. They released an album in February 2009 and completed their world tour in May of that year, as Brian Blade took over for Vinnie Colaiuta as drummer in Asia and some US concerts. The album &quot;Five Peace Band Live&quot; won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group

In 2011, McBride released his first big band album, &quot;The Good Feeling&quot;, for which he won the Grammy for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance.

McBride leads five groups: Inside Straight, featuring alto/soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson, vibraphonist Warren Wolf, pianist Peter Martin and drummer Carl Allen; a trio featuring pianist Christian Sands and drummer Jerome Jennings; his 18-piece big band; an experimental group called A Christian McBride Situation with pianist/keyboardist Patrice Rushen, turntablists DJ Logic and Jahi Sundance, saxophonist Ron Blake and vocalist Alyson Williams; and the New Jawn, featuring trumpeter Josh Evans, saxophonist Marcus Strickland, and drummer Nasheet Waits.

In March 2016, McBride was named artistic director of the Newport Jazz Festival, succeeding the festival&#x27;s founder and artistic director, George Wein.

McBride hosts NPR&#x27;s radio show, &quot;Jazz Night In America.&quot;

==Personal life==
Christian is married to jazz singer and educator Melissa Walker. Walker, with contributions by McBride, leads the Jazz House Kids, a jazz school in their home town of Montclair, New Jersey. Each summer, they both appear at the Montclair Jazz Festival, along with student ensembles led by the instructors, professional ensembles composed of instructors, and guest acts.

McBride shared the story of his first encounters with Freddie Hubbard in &quot;The Gig&quot; and his relationship with James Brown in &quot;Mr. Soul On Top&quot; on &quot;The Moth Radio Hour&quot;, a radio show and podcast devoted to story-telling.

==James Moody Jazz Festival==
McBride curates and advises the annual James Moody Jazz Festival.

<doc id="1274113" wikidata="Q333345" url="?curid=1274113" title="Harry Crookshank">
<text>Harry Frederick Comfort Crookshank, 1st Viscount Crookshank, (27 May 1893 – 17 October 1961), was a British Conservative politician. He was Minister of Health between 1951 and 1952 and Leader of the House of Commons between 1951 and 1955.

==Background and education==
Crookshank was born in Cairo, Egypt, the son of Harry Maule Crookshank and Emma, daughter of Major Samuel Comfort, of New York City. On his father&#x27;s side, he descended from Alexander Crookshank, of County Longford, Ireland, who represented Belfast in the Irish House of Commons and served as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford. In the First World War, he joined the Hampshire Regiment and served as a captain in the Grenadier Guards. On one occasion he was buried alive by an explosion for twenty minutes, and on another in 1916 he was castrated by shrapnel, requiring him to wear a surgical truss for the rest of his life. He was awarded by Serbia the Order of the White Eagle and Gold Medal for Valour.

He joined the Diplomatic Service in 1919 and worked at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., until 1924.

==Political career==
Crookshank was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Gainsborough in 1924, a seat he held for the next 32 years. He entered the government as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1934 under Ramsay MacDonald. When Stanley Baldwin became prime minister in 1935 Crookshank was appointed Secretary for Mines, a post he retained when Neville Chamberlain became prime minister in 1937 until February 1939. Crookshank called Chamberlain &quot;crazed and hypnotised by a loony&quot; to have accepted the Munich Agreement and sent a letter of resignation in protest, but was convinced to rescind it. In the latter year, he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He continued in this post also when Winston Churchill came to power in 1940, and was then Postmaster General under Churchill between 1943 and 1945. In 1942 he was offered the post of British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean at Algiers following the liberation of Algeria by Operation Torch but he declined, Harold Macmillan being appointed instead.

When the Conservatives returned to office under Churchill in 1951, Crookshank was appointed Minister of Health and Leader of the House of Commons, with a seat in the cabinet. In 1952 exchanged his post at the Ministry of Health for the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal, while he remained as Commons Leader. He continued in these two positions until December 1955, the last year under the premiership of Sir Anthony Eden. In the 1955 New Year Honours he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. He retired from the House of Commons in 1956 and was raised to the peerage as the Viscount Crookshank, of Gainsborough in the County of Lincoln, in January of that year. He had been offered a peerage in February 1940 but declined, having considered it at the time an insult because his First World War wounds had left him incapable of fathering any heir to a title.

Papers released by The National Archives, London, November 2007, show that Crookshank, with Harold Macmillan, led a faction within the third Churchill ministry who opposed what they perceived to be an attempt to bounce the Cabinet into a premature decision to authorise a British thermonuclear bomb programme in July 1954.

==Personal life==
Lord Crookshank was a Scottish Rite Freemason and Grand Master of Lincolnshire.

Incapable as result of his First World War wounds of fathering children, Crookshank was a lifelong bachelor. He was also (not publicly) known as a homosexual and caused a near scandal when a male lover of his was adopted as Conservative Party candidate for the Grimsby constituency in 1958 but later withdrawn. According to Chris Bryant he was a member of the Glamour Boys.

His home from 1937 was at 51 Pont Street, Kensington, London, where in 1947 he hosted a meeting of like-minded backbench MPs who unsuccessfully demanded Churchill&#x27;s removal as Leader of the Conservative Party.

He died of cancer at Chelsea, London, in October 1961, aged 68. The viscountcy died with him. Having been since 1960 High Steward of the City of Westminster, his funeral service took place at Westminster Abbey, followed by burial at Lincoln Cathedral. His sister, Helen Elizabeth Comfort Crookshank (1895–1948), lies next to him.

<doc id="1274120" wikidata="Q257905" url="?curid=1274120" title="*Walhaz">
<text>*&quot;Walhaz&quot; is a reconstructed Proto-Germanic word meaning &#x27;foreigner&#x27;, or more specifically &#x27;Roman&#x27;, &#x27;Romance-speaker&#x27; or &#x27;(romanized) Celt&#x27;, and survives in the English words of &#x27;Wales/Welsh&#x27; and &#x27;Cornwall.&#x27; The term was used by the ancient Germanic peoples to describe inhabitants of the former Roman Empire, who were largely romanised and spoke Latin languages (cf. Valland in Old Norse). The adjectival form is attested in Old Norse &#x27;, meaning &#x27;French&#x27;; [[Old High German]]&#x27;, meaning &#x27;Romance&#x27;; New High German &#x27;, used in [[Switzerland]] and [[South Tyrol]] for [[Romance languages|Romance]] speakers; [[Dutch language|Dutch]]&#x27; &#x27;Walloon&#x27;; Old English &#x27;,&#x27;, &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;Brythonic&#x27;. The forms of these words imply that they are descended from a Proto-Germanic form &quot;*walhiska-&quot;.

==From &quot;*Walhaz&quot; to &quot;welsch&quot;==
 is a loanword derived from the name of the Celtic tribe which was known to the Romans as Volcae (in the writings of Julius Caesar) and to the Greeks as (Strabo and Ptolemy). The Volcae tribe occupied territory neighbouring that of the Germanic people and seem to have been referred to by the proto-Germanic name (plural , adjectival form ). It is assumed that this term specifically referred to the Volcae, because application of Grimm&#x27;s law to that word produces the form . Subsequently, this term was applied rather indiscriminately to the southern neighbours of the Germanic people, as evidenced in geographic names such as Walchgau and Walchensee in Bavaria or Walensee in Switzerland. Place names containing the element *walhaz denote communities or enclaves in the Germanic-speaking world where Romance was spoken.

In Old English, *:walhaz developed into wealh, retaining the inherited meaning ‘a foreigner, more particularly a pre-Anglo-Saxon inhabitant of Britain who spoke Celtic or Latin or both’. It also came to imply the &#x27;social position of the British natives that in the West Saxon dialect of Old English&#x27; came to mean ‘(British) slave’. The old feminine derivative of *walhaz, Old English wiln &lt; *wielen &lt; * wealh-in-, even exclusively means ‘a female slave’ and is likewise concentrated in the Saxon south of England.

==From &quot;*Walhaz&quot; to &quot;Vlach&quot;==
From the Germanic and Slavic peoples the term passed to other groups, such as the Hungarians (, referring to Vlachs, generally used for Romanians; , referring to Italians), Turks () and Byzantines ( ) and was used for all Latin people of the Balkans.

<text>Jacob Gould Schurman (May 2, 1854 – August 12, 1942) was a Canadian-American educator and diplomat, who served as President of Cornell University and United States Ambassador to Germany.

==Early life and education==
Schurman was born at Freetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, on May 2, 1854 the son of Robert and Lydia Schurman. Schurman lived on his parents&#x27; farm as a child, then in 1867 took a job at a store near his home, which he held for two years.

At the age of fifteen, Schurman entered the Summerside Grammar School on Prince Edward Island, and in 1870 he won a scholarship to study at Prince of Wales College for two years. After Prince of Wales College, he studied for a year and a half at Acadia College in Nova Scotia.

In 1874, while a student at Acadia College in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, he won the Canadian Gilchrist scholarship to study at the University of London, from which he received a BA degree in 1877 and an MA in 1878. Schurman also studied in Paris, Edinburgh, Heidelberg, Berlin, Göttingen, and Italy.

==Career==
He was professor of English literature, political economy and psychology at Acadia College from 1880 to 1882, of metaphysics and English literature at Dalhousie College, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1882–86, and the Sage professor of philosophy (Sage professor) at Cornell University from 1886 to 1892, and Dean of the Sage School of Philosophy from 1891 to 1892, during which edited &quot;The Philosophical Review&quot;.

In 1892, he became the third president of Cornell University, a position he held until 1920. He received an LL.D (honoris causa) from the University of Edinburgh in March 1902.

===Cornell University president===
As president of Cornell University, Schurman helped invent the modern state-supported research university. Under the Morrill Act, states were obligated to fund the maintenance of land grant college facilities, but were not obligated to fund operations. Subsequent laws required states to match federal funds for agricultural research stations and cooperative extension. 

In his inaugural address as Cornell&#x27;s third president on November 11, 1892, Schurman announced his intention to enlist the financial support of the state. Cornell, which had been offering a four-year scholarship to one student in each New York assembly district every year and was the state&#x27;s land-grant university, was determined to convince the state to become a benefactor of the university. 

In 1894, the state legislature voted to give financial support for the establishment of the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine and to make annual appropriations for the college. This set the precedents of privately controlled, state-supported statutory colleges and cooperation between Cornell and the state. The annual state appropriations were later extended to agriculture, home economics, and following World War II, industrial and labor relations.

====New York State College of Forestry at Cornell====

In 1898, Schurman persuaded the State Legislature to found the first forestry college in North America, the New York State College of Forestry. The College undertook to establish a demonstration forest in the Adirondacks, funded by New York State. However, the plans of the school&#x27;s director Bernhard Fernow for the land drew criticism from neighbors, and Governor Benjamin B. Odell vetoed the 1903 appropriation for the school. 

In response, Cornell closed the school. Subsequently, in 1911, the State Legislature established a New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, and the remains of Cornell&#x27;s program became the Department of Natural Resources in its Agriculture College in 1910. The State later followed the same model to establish a state college of ceramics at Alfred University.

Schurman was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1908.

In 1911, Schurman ruled in favor of admitting two Black female students to Sage Hall despite 269 of their white female peers petitioning to deny them residency.

===International and governmental career===
He was the chairman of the First United States Philippine Commission in 1899, and wrote a part of the official report to Congress and &quot;Philippine Affairs--A Retrospect and an Outlook&quot; (1902). With J. E. Creighton and James Seth he founded in 1892 &quot;The Philosophical Review&quot;. He also wrote &quot; Kantian Ethics and the Ethics of Evolution&quot; (1881); &quot;The Ethical Import of Darwinism&quot; (1888); &quot;Belief in God&quot; (1890), and &quot;Agnosticism and Religion&quot; (1896).

Schurman served as United States Ambassador to Greece and Montenegro in 1912–13. In 1914 he declared support for female suffrage.

During World War I he insisted that American rights be respected; after the sinking of the Lusitania he pointed out that the action threatened to erase the distinction between combatants and non-combatants. In 1917 he was appointed a member of the New York State Food Commission, but resigned in June 1918 to go to France as lecturer to American soldiers.

After the war, he opposed many of the policies of Woodrow Wilson, but under Warren Harding, after resigning as president of Cornell in 1920, he was Minister to China between 1921 and 1925, and then as Ambassador to Germany between 1925 and 1929, a position twice previously held by Cornell&#x27;s first president Andrew Dickson White. In 1917 Schurman was appointed honorary chairman of the American Relief Committee for Greeks of Asia Minor, an organization which provided humanitarian relief to Ottoman Greeks during the Greek genocide. He retired to Bedford Hills, New York in 1930.

In 1960, Cornell named the administrative wing of its veterinary school Jacob Gould Schurman Hall in his honor. In 2021, the Cornell Filipino Association sought to discredit Schurman due to the work of the Philippine Commission and demanded that his name be removed from the building. After hearing from both sides, Cornell President Martha Pollack rejected the move. In 1967, Jacob Gould Schurman III endowed the Schurman professorships in his honor. Cornell describes them as &quot;one of the most prestigious chairs at the university.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Schurman married Barbara Forrest Munro (1865–1930) in 1884; they had seven children, including youngest daughter Dorothy Schurman Hawes, who wrote about China. Schurman&#x27;s father-in-law was George Munro; in 1881, he endowed Schurman the chair in English literature and philosophy at Dalhousie University, where Munro was the principal benefactor.

<doc id="1274122" wikidata="Q5326606" url="?curid=1274122" title="Early Canadian banking system">
<text>The early Canadian banking system (British North America and New France until 1763; then renamed Upper and Lower Canada) was regulated entirely by the colonial government. Primitive forms of banking emerged early in the colonial period to solve the &quot;drain of wealth&quot; caused by the application of mercantilist theory. The drain of wealth translated into a complete lack of gold or silver bullion in the colonies, and thus, a complete lack of forms of economic exchange and payment.
==History==
In New France, playing cards were issued as a method of payment in the 1680s by the Intendant of New France, in addition to the coins introduced in the 1660s. However, the massive drain of wealth from New France to Europe resulting from mercantilist trade policies made it impossible to back card money with gold bullion. Card money was thus essentially worthless. The card system collapsed in the 1690s, causing long-term suspicion of paper money on the part of the French settlers.

Card money was replaced in the 18th century by a type of promissory note called &quot;bons&quot;, derived from the French phrase, &quot;bon pour&quot;, meaning &quot;good for the indicated amount&quot;. These were issued to a limited extent by French merchants, who, lacking in any other form of currency, were forced to create their own, and who consequently became the first Canadian bankers. The issue of &quot;bons&quot; spread rapidly into British North America after 1763, when New France became a British possession.

&quot;Bons&quot; persisted as the most common type of currency until 1812, along with the English pound, American and Spanish coinage, and the &quot;Halifax standard&quot;.

The British administration under Isaac Brock introduced what became known as &quot;army bills&quot; in 1812, in order to finance the War of 1812. The total value of these bills was 250,000 pounds. These were promissory notes issued directly by the government. They came into wide usage during the war (1812–1815) to make up for the lack of bullion in Upper and Lower Canada. Unlike the card money used in the late 17th century, army bills could be and were in fact exchanged for gold coin once the war had ended. The army bills had thus proven themselves reliable, eradicating any real stigma against paper currency.
In 1817, Montreal bankers were granted a charter by the British government to open the first formal bank in Canada. This was the Bank of Montreal. Under its charter, the Bank of Montreal was given a monopoly on the right to issue promissory notes on the model of the army bills. Because of its monopoly rights, the Bank of Montreal essentially acted as a central bank for both Upper and Lower Canada.

In the years after 1817, Britain granted several new bank charters, including a charter to the now-defunct Bank of Kingston, which was to act as a competitor to the Bank of Montreal in Upper Canada. The new chartered banks were required under the terms of their charters to recognise one another&#x27;s currency, a practice that allowed for the development of long-distance trade within British North America. However, banking remained in private hands, which meant that the issue of currency was at the discretion of private bankers. This frequently led to high inflation when the infant Canadian economy was in recession(source?).
The &quot;Provincial Note Act&quot; was passed in 1866 to link note issue to the needs of the British administration. This marked the beginning of an enduring policy of government intervention in the Canadian economy. The British North America Act of 1867 formally codified this policy, allowing for government control over coinage, currency, bills of exchange, promissory notes, banking, and incorporation of banks. This in turn allowed for the creation of a uniform currency across Canada. Official Canadian currency took the form of the Canadian dollar in 1871, overriding the currency of individual banks.

After Confederation, Canada developed a banking system very different from that of the United States. Whereas the United States was served a large number of small banks serving just one town or, at most state, Canada&#x27;s banking sector came to be dominated by a few banks with transcontinental branch networks. The Canadian system promoted stability and produced far fewer bank failures than either the contemporary United States or Australian banking systems. The downside of the Canadian banking system was that it was much less competitive that the United States and Australian systems, which meant that consumers paid more for banking services. The legal foundation of the Canadian banking system consisted of a series of laws passed in 1870 and 1871. 

Banking remained relatively decentralized until 1935, when the Bank of Canada was founded in response to the economic instability experienced during the Great Depression in Canada. First opened on December 5, 1980, Canada&#x27;s Currency Museum is located on the ground floor of the Bank of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario.

All of the tracks on the original album are improvisations based on Corea’s ideas, with some being entirely free improvisations (such as &quot;The Law of Falling and Catching Up&quot; and &quot;Fragments&quot;). Vitous and Haynes would reunite with Corea as an acoustic trio on &quot;Trio Music&quot; (ECM, 1982), &quot;Trio Music, Live in Europe&quot; (ECM, 1986), and &quot;The Trio Live From The Country Club&quot; (Stretch, 1996). The trio also backed saxophonist Toshiyuki Honda on the album &quot;Dream&quot; (Eastworld, 1983).

The bonus tracks released on the CD include a cover of Thelonious Monk&#x27;s composition &quot;Pannonica&quot; and the Wood/Mellin standard &quot;My One and Only Love&quot;. All eight pieces had originally been issued in 1975 on &quot;Circling In&quot;, a Blue Note “twofer”.

According to Corea, the album title comes from the &quot;I Ching&quot;, which contains a section called &quot;Now He Sings; Now He Sobs — Now He Beats The Drum; Now He Stops.&quot; He recalled: &quot;The poetry of that phrase fit the message of the trio&#x27;s music... the gamut of life experiences — the whole human picture and range of emotions.&quot;

== Reception ==

&quot;DownBeat&quot;&#x27;s reviewer awarded the original release zero stars, refusing to assign a rating because he didn&#x27;t know what to think of it.

In 1999, the single &quot;Now He Sings, Now He Sobs&quot; was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award.

In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as &quot;the place where [Corea] put all the pieces in motion for his long, adventurous career,&quot; and wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s an intellectual rigor balanced by an instinctual hunger that makes for music that&#x27;s lively and challenging while also containing a patina of comfort... it captures the pianist at the brink: it&#x27;s kinetic, exciting, and filled with endless possibilities.&quot;

The authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot; awarded the album a full 4 stars, calling it &quot;a fine, solid jazz set with some intelligently handled standard material.&quot;

The editors of &quot;MusicHound Jazz&quot; awarded the album a full 5 stars, and writer Ralph Burnett noted that it &quot;features Corea&#x27;s best original writing and a superb trio.&quot;

Will Layman of &quot;PopMatters&quot; included the recording in his article &quot;The 11 Best Chick Corea Albums,&quot; and stated: &quot;Can an artist sum up their career in what was essentially a debut? Yes.&quot; On a similar note, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s John Fordham included the album in his list of Corea&#x27;s &quot;10 Greatest Recordings,&quot; noting that it &quot;found him at a crossroads, pulled between the swing of the classic acoustic jazz-piano trio and the more free-associative future he would soon briefly explore,&quot; and praising his &quot;powerful and intuitive partners,&quot; who &quot;follow his every move.&quot;

Author and drummer Michael Stephans called the album &quot;a piano trio classic,&quot; and commented: &quot;Many musicians and listeners alike believe it to be one of the greatest modern jazz trio records ever made. Corea is in top form, and Haynes and Vitous are responsive, supportive, and daring in their accompaniment and solos.&quot;

Writer and historian Loren Schoenberg remarked: &quot;it is refreshing to go back to this... to hear how original his style sounded bounding out of the context of the 1960s... Corea&#x27;s compositions and free-flowing concept set him apart from the pack even at this early date.&quot;

The singer Bilal named it among his 25 favorite albums, explaining: &quot;I think that&#x27;s just one of the best jazz trio albums ever. Mostly every jazz musician I talk to love that album. It&#x27;s just a classic.&quot;

<doc id="1274133" wikidata="Q5281276" url="?curid=1274133" title="Disappearance of Sarah MacDiarmid">
<text>Sarah MacDiarmid (born 15 November 1966) was a 23-year-old Scottish-Australian woman who disappeared from Kananook railway station in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 11 July 1990. She is presumed murdered, although no trace of her body has ever been found.

==Disappearance==
MacDiarmid, who emigrated with her family in 1987 from the Scottish Highlands to Australia, had been playing tennis after work with two friends at what was then known as Flinders Park in Batman Avenue, East Melbourne, before walking to Richmond station, where they found that they had just missed a Frankston line train. They caught a train to Caulfield, then changed to a Frankston service. MacDiarmid&#x27;s friends disembarked this train at Bonbeach while she remained, continuing on to Kananook station where her vehicle was parked. She was last seen getting off the train and heading for the poorly lit car park at approximately 10:20 p.m. At around 11pm, MacDiarmid&#x27;s family grow concern when she hasn&#x27;t arrived home yet. At 1am, MacDiarmid&#x27;s brother, Alisdair, goes to Kananook railway station to wait for the last train at 1:15 am, Sarah is not on the train. He finds her car in the car park with the doors and boot locked.

==Investigation==
Police suspected that MacDiarmid had been assaulted, based on bloodstains found beside her red 1978 Honda Civic abandoned in the station car park, and drag marks leading into the bushes. A cigarette lighter belonging to MacDiarmid was discovered on the ground, but no trace of her was ever found. Later, witnesses said MacDiarmid got off the train and crossed the footbridge to the car park, where some people heard a woman shouting, &quot;Give me back my keys!&quot;. An extensive 21-day air, sea and land search, involving more than 250 police, produced no results.

In May 2006, an inquest held by coroner Ian West, found MacDiarmid &quot;had met her death as a result of foul play but the exact circumstances were unknown&quot;.

An initial state government reward of $50,000 was increased after an additional $75,000 was offered by an anonymous benefactor. That was increased to $1 million in 2004 and remains current.

In 2011, convicted serial killer Paul Denyer was interviewed by police and denied any involvement in MacDiarmid&#x27;s disappearance. Denyer stated to the interviewer, Detective Ron Iddles that he was &quot;sick of being accused of murder&quot;, and later wrote to Iddles, thanking him for informing the public of him not being involved in the matter.

In May 2014, News Corp Australia claimed police investigators considered convicted serial killer Bandali Debs to be a suspect in the case. Fairfax Media quoted a &quot;senior police source&quot; who said &quot;it was &#x27;common practice&#x27; for homicide investigators to examine links between unsolved murders and known offenders&quot;. A Victoria Police spokesperson declined to comment to Fairfax Media as MacDiarmid&#x27;s disappearance was an &quot;active&quot; case.

==Aftermath==
The cold case was featured in the first episode of the Australian psychic TV series &quot;Sensing Murder&quot;, which aired on Network Ten in September 2004. The psychics used by this programme opined that MacDiarmid had been murdered and her body thrown into a now-closed rubbish dump on the Mornington Peninsula.

In 2010, marking the 20th anniversary of MacDiarmid&#x27;s disappearance, her family and friends visited Kananook railway station to leave wreaths at a memorial established there. Her family also announced they had created a website &quot;Not Alone&quot; which was &#x27;designed to help other families who find themselves in a position similar to them&#x27;. Police used the anniversary to issue a new call for information on the case with Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Dannye Moloney stating:You do not close the books on these sorts of crimes... History proves that if you continue to communicate with the people out there, in Victoria, in Australia, in the world in some cases, that piece of information, that key will come forward and we&#x27;ll solve it.In 2021, a nine part Australian crime podcast named &quot;Searching for Sarah Macdiarmid&quot; was released. Hosted and written by author Vikki Petraitis, the podcast focuses on the backstory of MacDiarmid, her disappearance, and the subsequent investigation.

<text>Larry Grenadier (born February 6, 1966, in San Francisco) is an American jazz double bassist.

==Early life==
Grenadier&#x27;s father was a trumpet player in World War II army bands and later in Europe, but stopped playing professionally before his children were born. Grenadier began on trumpet when he was in fifth grade, before beginning to play the bass the following year. Grenadier&#x27;s brothers played trumpet and guitar. Grenadier&#x27;s father helped introduce him to the instruments and music theory. Larry&#x27;s older brother Phil began listening to jazz around this time, influencing his sibling&#x27;s musical interests. Grenadier began listening to several jazz bassists including Ray Brown, Charles Mingus, Richard Davis, Paul Chambers, Wilbur Ware and Oscar Pettiford, among others.

At age 12 Grenadier began formal study of the acoustic bass, learning from local jazz bass players Chris Poehlor, Paul Breslin, and Frank Tusa and later classical bassists Michael Burr and Stephen Tramontozzi. At 16, Grenadier had a busy career playing in the San Francisco Bay Area with both local musicians and those traveling through town in need of a bass player. These musicians included Harvey Wainapel, Bobby Hutcherson, Joe Henderson, Larry Vuckovitch, Eddie Henderson, Bruce Forman, Eddie Marshall, Vince Lateano, George Cables and Donald Bailey, Toots Thielmans, Johnny Griffin, Charles McPherson and Frank Morgan, among others.

Grenadier studied at Stanford University and graduated in 1989 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature. At Stanford, he met Stan Getz, with whom he toured.

==Career==

After graduating from Stanford, Grenadier moved to Boston to play with vibraphonist Gary Burton. In 1991, he moved to New York. He continued to collaborate with some of the musicians he had met during his time in Boston, such as Kurt Rosenwinkel, Joshua Redman, Mark Turner, Jorge Rossy, and Chris Cheek. Others he met for the first time in New York include Bill Stewart, Kevin Hays, Renee Rosnes, Ralph Moore, Billy Drummond, Danilo Perez, David Sánchez, Tom Harrell and Billy Hart. Grenadier continued his association with Joe Henderson, touring with his band which at times included Al Foster, Renee Rosnes and Larry Willis. He also spent a few months during his earlier years in New York playing in Betty Carter&#x27;s band.

In the early 1990s, Grenadier first met and played with pianist Brad Mehldau. He joined Mehldau&#x27;s Trio with drummer Jorge Rossy; together they toured and recorded for more than ten years. Rossy was replaced by drummer Jeff Ballard in 2004.

Grenadier has worked with guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom he toured as a trio along with drummer Bill Stewart. He credits his experiences touring with Metheny&#x27;s trio as a significant learning experience.

Grenadier has also played with John Scofield, Hudson (a collaborative project with Jack DeJohnette, John Medeski and John Scofield), Charles Lloyd, Chris Potter, Billy Higgins, Michael Brecker, and Paul Motian, among many others. In 2014 Larry Grenadier collaborates with Stefano Bollani on the album &quot;Sheik yer Zappa&quot;.

Grenadier is a member of FLY, a trio which includes drummer Jeff Ballard and tenor saxophonist Mark Turner. They have recorded three critically acclaimed albums. He also tours and records with his wife, singer-songwriter Rebecca Martin. A landmark solo bass album &quot;The Gleaners&quot; was issued by the ECM label in 2019.

== Personal ==
Grenadier married Rebecca Martin, the singer and songwriter on June 7, 1997. Grenadier and Martin live in the Hudson Valley. Together, they have one son, Charlie (born 2005).

<text>In computer networking, the default route is a configuration of the Internet Protocol (IP) that establishes a forwarding rule for packets when no specific address of a next-hop host is available from the routing table or other routing mechanisms.

The default route is generally the address of another router, which treats the packet the same way: if a route matches, the packet is forwarded accordingly, otherwise the packet is forwarded to the default route of that router. The route evaluation process in each router uses the longest prefix match method to obtain the most specific route. The network with the longest subnet mask or network prefix that matches the destination IP address is the next-hop network gateway. The process repeats until a packet is delivered to the destination host, or earlier along the route, when a router has no default route available and cannot route the packet otherwise. In the latter case, the packet is dropped and an ICMP &quot;Destination Unreachable&quot; message may be returned. Each router traversal counts as one hop in the distance calculation for the transmission path.

The device to which the default route points is often called the default gateway, and it often carries out other functions such as packet filtering, firewalling, or proxy server operations.

The default route in Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is designated as the zero address, in CIDR notation. Similarly, in IPv6, the default route is specified by . The subnet mask is specified as , which effectively specifies all networks and is the shortest match possible. A route lookup that does not match any other rule falls back to this route.

In the highest-level segment of a network, administrators generally point the default route for a given host towards the router that has a connection to a network service provider. Therefore, packets with destinations outside the organization&#x27;s LAN, typically destinations on the Internet or a wide area network, are forwarded to the router with the connection to that provider.

<doc id="1274140" wikidata="Q2656593" url="?curid=1274140" title="Islam in Azerbaijan">
<text>Islam is the majority religion in Azerbaijan, but the country is considered to be the most secular in the Muslim world. Various reports have estimated 97.3% (CIA, 2020) or 99.2% (Pew Research Center, 2006) of the population identifying as Muslim; with the majority being adherents of the Shia branch (55-65%), while a significant minority (35-45%) are Sunnis. Traditionally, the differences between these two branches of Islam have not been sharply defined in Azerbaijan.

Most Shia Muslims in the country follow the Ja&#x27;fari school of Shia Islam, while Sunni Muslims typically adhere to either the Hanafi or Shafi&#x27;i school. Due to many decades of Soviet atheist policy, religious affiliation in Azerbaijan is often nominal and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity than on religion. Shia Islam is prevalent in the western, central, and southern regions of the country. Traditionally, villages around Baku and the Lankaran region are considered Shia strongholds. In contrast, Sunni Islam is dominant in the northern regions.

==History==
Islam arrived in Azerbaijan with Arabs in the seventh century, gradually supplanting Christianity and pagan cults.

In the sixteenth century, the first shah of the Safavid Dynasty, Ismail I (r. 1501-1524), established Shi&#x27;a Islam as the state religion, although a portion of people remained Sunni. The population of what is nowadays Iran and what is nowadays Azerbaijan were converted to Shia Islam at the same moment in history.

As elsewhere in the Muslim world, the two branches of Islam came into conflict in Azerbaijan. Enforcement of Shi&#x27;a Islam as the state religion brought contention between the Safavid rulers and the ruling Sunnis of the neighboring Ottoman Empire.

In the nineteenth century, many Sunni Muslims emigrated from Russian-controlled Azerbaijan because of Russia&#x27;s series of wars with their coreligionists in the Ottoman Empire. Thus, by the late nineteenth century, the Shi&#x27;a population was in the majority in Russian Azerbaijan. Antagonism between the Sunnis and the Shi&#x27;a diminished in the late nineteenth century as Azerbaijani nationalism began to emphasize a common Turkic heritage and opposition to Iranian religious influences.

===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===

In 1806, Azerbaijan became occupied by the Russian Empire as the latter invaded Qajar Iran during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813). In the aftermath, Iran was forced to cede therefore almost all of Azerbaijan according to the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 to Russia. However, all this only came to be confirmed in the aftermath of the next and last war between Russia and Iran, the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828) and the resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. In 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence from Russia and established the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic under its leading Musavat party, but was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920.

Before Soviet power was established, about 2,000 mosques were active in Azerbaijan. Most mosques were closed in the 1930s, then some were allowed to reopen during World War II. The Soviet rule promoted an Azerbaijani national consciousness as a substitute for identification with the world Islamic community and Iran.

During World War II, Soviet authorities established the Muslim Spiritual Board of Transcaucasia in Baku as the governing body of Islam in the Caucasus, in effect reviving the nineteenth-century tsarist Muslim Ecclesiastical Board. During the tenures of Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev, Moscow encouraged Muslim religious leaders in Azerbaijan to visit and host foreign Muslim leaders, with the goal of advertising the freedom of religion and superior living conditions reportedly enjoyed by Muslims under Soviet communism.

During the Azerbaijani SSR, there were 17 mosques functioning in the country. In the 1980s only two large and five smaller mosques held services in Baku, and only eleven others were operating in the rest of the country. Supplementing the officially sanctioned mosques were thousands of private houses of prayer and many secret Islamic sects.

The lone center of conservative Shia Islam, was the town of Nardaran, 25 kilometers northeast of central Baku, and was renowned for its thirteenth-century Shia shrine. Unlike the rest of the country which was staunchly secular and which can be considered religiously progressive, Nardaran was the only place in the whole of Azerbaijan where its inhabitants are devoutly religious and fundamentalist, where its streets display religious banners and where most women wear chadors in public. The now banned Islamic Party of Azerbaijan was founded in this town and its base was centered there.

There is some evidence of Sufism in Azerbaijan.

===After the Soviet Union===

Beginning in the late Gorbachev period, and especially after independence, the number of mosques rose dramatically. Many were built with the support of other Islamic countries, such as Iran, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, which also contributed Qur&#x27;ans and religious instructors to the new Muslim states. A Muslim seminary has also been established since 1991. The growing number of religious Muslims resulted in the establishment of more than 2,000 mosques by 2014.

After independence, the laws regarding religion are quite clear. In Article 7 of the constitution, Azerbaijan is declared a secular state. This point is driven home in Article 19 with the statement of the separation of religion and state and the equality of all religions before the law as well as the secular character of the state educational system.

== Religiosity levels ==
Azerbaijan has been a secular country and is often considered the most secularized Muslim-majority nation.

A 1998 survey estimated the proportion of ardent believers in Azerbaijan at close to 7 percent, slightly more than the number of declared atheists — almost 4 percent — with the largest numbers falling into the category of those who consider Islam above all as a way of life, without strict observance of prohibitions and requirements, or as a fundamental part of national identity. Another 1998 poll estimated the proportion of ardent believers in Azerbaijan at only 20 percent.

In a 2010 survey only half of Azerbaijanis answering yes to the question, &quot;Is religion an important part of your daily life?&quot;.

Yet in 2017 Dobroslawa Wiktor-Mach noted an Islamic revival in the country: In 2010, the &quot;Caucasus Research Resource Center&quot; (CRRC)&#x27;s &quot;Caucasus Barometer&quot; found out that for around 25% of the citizens religion was &quot;very important&quot; and for 43% &quot;rather important&quot; but just two years later, in 2012, as per the same organization those who considered it &quot;very important&quot; rose to 33% while those who chose &quot;rather important&quot; rose to 47% (16% selecting &quot;less important&quot;, 2% not important and 1% not knowing.)

==Radical Islam==
There is a certain rise of religious extremism across Azerbaijan as a result of continued problems such as corruption, poverty, and government rule, combined with disillusionment with the West and support of religious sects from different countries. However it works against a headwind of traditional secularism. According to Svante Cornell:

Azerbaijan can rightly claim to be among the most progressive and secular Islamic societies. Aside from having been the first Muslim country to have operas, theater plays, and a democratic republic, Azerbaijan today is among the Muslim countries where support for secularism is the highest, and where radical ideologies have met only very limited interest.

Svante Cornell believes that the radical groups remain weak, but have a potential to grow under the current domestic and international circumstances. To confront this, the Azerbaijani state needs to address the diarchy in terms of supervision of religious structures. He writes, that the Government policies toward Islam in general and Islamic radicalism in particular have been inadequate.

According to researchers Emil Souleimanov and Maya Ehrmann, there is &quot;a trend among Dagestani minorities in the north of Azerbaijan to engage in insurgent activities&quot;. The Salafi movement has been &quot;spurred by missionary activities using external funds and the establishment of mosques&quot;, and found support from those who the desire a return to more traditionalist values. As authorities have repressed Salafis in the north they have become more radical.

Citizens of Azerbaijan have joined terrorist organizations in Syria.

In Nardaran, a deadly incident broke out between Azerbaijan security forces and religious Shia residents in which two policemen and four suspected Shia Muslim militants were killed.

As a result of this incident, the Azerbaijani parliament passed laws prohibiting people with religious education received abroad to implement Islamic rites and ceremonies in Azerbaijan, as well as to preach in mosques and occupy leading positions in the country; as well as prohibiting the display of religious paraphernalia, flags and slogans, except in places of worship, religious centers and offices. Ashura commemorations in public have also been banned. The Azerbaijani government also passed a law to remove the citizenship of Azerbaijani citizens who fight abroad.

<doc id="1274142" wikidata="Q268875" url="?curid=1274142" title="Herbert Bowden, Baron Aylestone">
<text>Herbert William Bowden, Baron Aylestone (20 January 1905 – 30 April 1994) was a British Labour politician.

==Early life==
Born in Cardiff, Wales, Bowden was the son of Herbert Bowden, a baker, and his wife Henrietta (née Gould). Bowden later recalled that &quot;I was born with the smell of bread in my nostrils and lived around the bakehouses. I always had one thought in mind – never to be employed in them.&quot; After completing elementary school he opened a tobacconist&#x27;s shop, but following the collapse of his business during the Great Depression he left Cardiff to look for work elsewhere, eventually becoming a radio salesman in Leicester.

==Political career==
Bowden had been a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) as a young man, but sided with the Labour Party when the two parties disagreed over how best to support the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, he was elected to sit on Leicester City Council, and later that year became president of the city&#x27;s Labour Party. Having served as a flying officer in the Royal Air Force during World War II, Bowden was elected MP for Leicester South at the 1945 general election, and then for Leicester South West from 1950 until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1967. He was appointed a whip in 1949 and a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury in 1950. From 1951 onwards, he was Deputy Chief Whip, then Chief Whip throughout Labour&#x27;s years in opposition. Bowden was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

Bowden was regarded as being on the right of the Labour Party, and supported Hugh Gaitskell in his battles with the left before switching his allegiance to Harold Wilson following Gaitskell&#x27;s death in 1963. He was, as the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; later commented, somewhat &quot;traditional&quot; in his mindset, representing the &quot;authentic... old hat, passé, reactionary voice of the Labour Party&quot;, but his forthright attitude to party discipline (which had earned him the sobriquet &quot;The Sergeant Major&quot; amongst Labour MPs) made him an efficient and much-respected parliamentary whip. Thus, when Labour returned to power in 1964, Bowden was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council, having become a Privy Counsellor in 1962. In 1966, he was moved to the new post of Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, serving until 1967. On 1 September 1967 he succeeded Lord Hill as chairman of the Independent Television Authority.

On 20 September 1967, Bowden was created a life peer as Baron Aylestone, &quot;of Aylestone in the City of Leicester&quot;, taking the Labour whip. He was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1975 Birthday Honours, and from 1984 to 1992 was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. To many people&#x27;s surprise, he left Labour to join the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. Remaining with the SDP throughout the party&#x27;s existence, after its demise in 1988 he chose to follow David Owen&#x27;s breakaway &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP rather than support the merger with the Liberals. When the Owenite rump itself dissolved two years later, Aylestone sat in the Lords as an &#x27;Independent Social Democrat&#x27; before joining the Liberal Democrats in 1992.

==Death==
Lord Aylestone died in 1994, aged 89, in Worthing, Sussex, and was survived by his second wife and a daughter from his first marriage.

<text>CenTrio, formerly known as the Seattle Steam Company, is a district heating public utility that provides steam (generated by burning natural gas, diesel oil, and recycled wood) to over 175 businesses in downtown Seattle and on First and Capitol Hills via 18 miles of steam pipeline. Its plants are located on Western Avenue at Union Street, just west of Pike Place Market, and on Post Avenue at Yesler Way, in Pioneer Square.

== About ==
Seattle Steam was founded in 1893 as the Seattle Steam Heat and Power Co. It owns 18 miles of pipes under the streets of Downtown. Its average winter output is of steam per hour; this drops to less than in the summer.

Seattle Steam&#x27;s biggest customers are Swedish Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, and Virginia Mason Medical Center, which use the steam for heat and sterilization. Other big customers include hotels, which use the steam for heat and for generating hot water, Seattle Public Library, which uses it for heat and the Seattle Art Museum, which uses it for heat and humidity control.

In May 2014, Seattle Steam was bought by Enwave Energy Corporation, a unit of Brookfield Asset Management of Toronto, and renamed Enwave Seattle.

<text>Paul Schützenberger (23 December 1829 – 26 June 1897) was a French chemist. He was born in Strasbourg, where his father Georges Frédéric Schützenberger (1779–1859) was professor of law, and his uncle Charles Schützenberger (1809–1881) professor of chemical medicine.

He was intended for a medical career and graduated MD from the University of Strasbourg in 1855, but his interests laid in physical and chemical sciences. In 1853 he went to Paris as preparateur to JF Persoz (1805–1868), professor of chemistry at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. A year later he was entrusted with a course of chemical instruction at Mulhouse, and he remained in that town until 1865 as professor at the École Supérieure des Sciences.

He then returned to Paris as assistant to AJ Balard at the College de France, in 1876 he succeeded him in the chair of chemistry, and in 1882 he became directing professor at the municipal École de Physique et de Chimie. The two latter chairs he held together until his death, which happened at Mézy, Seine et Oise.

During the period he spent at Mulhouse, Schützenberger paid special attention to industrial chemistry, particularly in connection with colouring matters, but he also worked at general and biological chemistry which subsequently occupied the greater part of his time. He is known for a long series of researches on the constitution of alkaloids and of the albuminoid bodies, and for the preparation of several new series of platinum compounds and of , H2S2O4.

Towards the end of his life he adopted the view that the elements have been formed by some process of condensation from one primordial substance of extremely small atomic weight, and he expressed the conviction that atomic weights within narrow limits are variable and modified according to the physical conditions in which a compound is formed.

His publications include:

* &quot;Chimie appliquée à la physiologie et à la pathologie animale&quot; (1863); 
* &quot;Traité des matières colorantes&quot; (1867); 
* &quot;Les Fermentations&quot; (1875), which was translated into German, Italian and English; 
* &quot;Traité de chimie générale&quot; in seven volumes (1880–1894).

<doc id="1274156" wikidata="Q1138815" url="?curid=1274156" title="Desktop search">
<text>Desktop search tools search within a user&#x27;s own computer files as opposed to searching the Internet. These tools are designed to find information on the user&#x27;s PC, including web browser history, e-mail archives, text documents, sound files, images, and video. A variety of desktop search programs are now available; see this list for examples. Most desktop search programs are standalone applications. Desktop search products are software alternatives to the search software included in the operating system, helping users sift through desktop files, emails, attachments, and more.

Desktop search emerged as a concern for large firms for two main reasons: untapped productivity and security. According to analyst firm Gartner, up to 80% of some companies&#x27; data is locked up inside unstructured data — the information stored on a user&#x27;s PC, the directories (folders) and files they&#x27;ve created on a network, documents stored in repositories such as corporate intranets and a multitude of other locations. Moreover, many companies have structured or unstructured information stored in older file formats to which they don&#x27;t have ready access.

The sector attracted considerable attention in the late 2004 to early 2005 period from the struggle between Microsoft and Google. According to market analysts, both companies were attempting to leverage their monopolies (of web browsers and search engines, respectively) to strengthen their dominance. Due to Google&#x27;s complaint that users of Windows Vista cannot choose any competitor&#x27;s desktop search program over the built-in one, an agreement was reached between US Justice Department and Microsoft that Windows Vista Service Pack 1 would enable users to choose between the built-in and other desktop search programs, and select which one is to be the default. As of September 2011, Google ended life for Google Desktop.

== Technologies ==
Most desktop search engines build and maintain an index database to improve performance when searching large amounts of data. Indexing usually takes place when the computer is idle and most search applications can be set to suspend indexing if a portable computer is running on batteries, in order to save power. There are notable exceptions, however: Voidtools&#x27; Everything Search Engine, which performs searches over only file names, not contents, is able to build its index from scratch in just a few seconds. Another exception is Vegnos Desktop Search Engine, which performs searches over filenames and files&#x27; contents without building any indices. An index may also not be up-to-date, when a query is performed. In this case, results returned will not be accurate (that is, a hit may be shown when it is no longer there, and a file may not be shown, when in fact it is a hit). Some products have sought to remedy this disadvantage by building a real-time indexing function into the software. There are disadvantages to not indexing. Namely, the time to complete a query can be significant, and the issued query can also be resource-intensive.

Desktop search tools typically collect three types of information about files:
* file and folder names
* metadata, such as titles, authors, comments in file types such as MP3, PDF and JPEG
* file content, for the types of documents supported by the tool

Long-term goals for desktop search include the ability to search the contents of image files, sound files and video by context.

==Platforms &amp; their histories==

=== Windows ===

Indexing Service, a &quot;base service that extracts content from files and constructs an indexed catalog to facilitate efficient and rapid searching&quot;, was originally released in August 1996. It was built in order to speed up manually searching for files on Personal Desktops and Corporate Computer Network. Indexing service helped by using Microsoft web servers to index files on the desired hard drives. Indexing was done by file format. By using terms that users provided, a search was conducted that matched terms to the data within the file formats. The largest issue that Indexing service faced was the fact that every time a file was added, it had to be indexed. This coupled with the fact that the indexing cached the entire index in RAM, made the hardware a huge limitation. This made indexing large amounts of files require extremely powerful hardware and very long wait times.

In 2003, Windows Desktop Search (WDS) replaced Microsoft Indexing Service. Instead of only matching terms to the details of the file format and file names, WDS brings in content indexing to all Microsoft files and text-based formats such as e-mail and text files. This means, that WDS looked into the files and indexed the content. Thus, when a user searched a term, WDS no longer matched just information such as file format types and file names, but terms, and values stored within those files. WDS also brought &quot;Instant searching&quot; meaning the user could type a character and the query would instantly start searching and updating the query as the user typed in more characters. Windows Search apparently used up a lot of processing power, as Windows Desktop Search would only run if it was directly queried or while the PC was idle. Even only running while directly queried or while the computer was idled, indexing the entire hard drive still took hours. The index would be around 10% of the size of all the files that it indexed, e.g. if the indexed files amounted to around 100GB, the index size would be 10GB.

With the release of Windows Vista came Windows Search 3.1. Unlike its predecessors WDS and Windows Search 3.0, 3.1 could search through both indexed and non indexed locations seamlessly. Also, the RAM and CPU requirements were greatly reduced, cutting back indexing times immensely. Windows Search 4.0 is currently running on all PCs with Windows 7 and up.

=== Mac OS ===
In 1994 the AppleSearch search engine was introduced, allowing users to fully search all documents within their Macintosh computer, including file format types, meta-data on those files, and content within the files. AppleSearch was a client/server application, and as such required a server separate from the main device in order to function. The biggest issue with AppleSearch were its large resource requirements: &quot;AppleSearch requires at least a 68040 processor and 5MB of RAM.&quot; At the time, a Macintosh computer with these specifications was priced at approximately $1400; equivalent to $2050 in 2015. On top of this, the software itself cost an additional $1400 for a single license.

In 1997, Sherlock was released alongside Mac OS 8.5. Sherlock (named after the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes) was integrated into Mac OS&#x27;s file browser – Finder. Sherlock extended the desktop search function to the World Wide Web, allowing users to search both locally and externally. Adding additional functions—such as internet access—to Sherlock was relatively simple, as this was done through plugins written as plain text files. Sherlock was included in every release of Mac OS from Mac OS 8, before being deprecated and replaced by Spotlight and Dashboard in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. It was officially removed in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard

Spotlight was released in 2005 as part of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. It is a Selection-based search tool, which means the user invokes a query using only the mouse. Spotlight allows the user to search the Internet for more information about any keyword or phrase contained within a document or webpage, and uses a built-in calculator and Oxford American Dictionary to offer quick access to small calculations and word definitions. While Spotlight initially has a long startup time, this decreases as the hard disk is indexed. As files are added by the user, the index is constantly updated in the background using minimal CPU &amp; RAM resources.

=== Linux ===
There are a wide range of desktop search options for Linux users, depending upon the skill level of the user, their preference to use desktop tools which tightly integrate into their desktop environment, command-shell functionality (often with advanced scripting options), or browser-based users interfaces to locally running software. In addition, many users create their own indexing from a variety of indexing packages (e.g. one which does extraction and indexing of PDF/DOC/DOCX/ODT documents well, another search engine which works ith/ vcard, LDAP, and other directory/contact databases, as well as the conventional codice_1 and codice_2 commands.

====Ubuntu====

Ubuntu Linux didn&#x27;t have desktop search until release Feisty Fawn 7.04. Using Tracker desktop search, the desktop search feature was very similar to Mac OS&#x27;s AppleSearch and Sherlock. It not only featured the basic features of file format sorting and meta-data matching, but support for searching through emails and instant messages was added. In 2014 Recoll was added to Linux distributions, working with other search programs such as Tracker and Beagle to provide efficient full text search. This greatly increased the types of queries and file types that Linux desktop searches could handle. A major advantage of Recoll is that it allows for greater customization of what is indexed; Recoll will index the entire hard disk by default, but can be made to index only selected directories, omitting directories that will never need to be searched.

====openSUSE====

Starting with KDE4, the NEPOMUK was introduced. It provided the ability to index a wide range of desktop content, email, and use semantic web technologies (e.g. RDF) to annotate the database. The introduction faced a few glitches, much of which seemed to be based on the triplestore. Performance improved (at least for queries) by switching the backend to a stripped-down version of the Virtuoso Open Source Edition, however indexing remained a common user complaint.
Based on user feedback, the Nepomuk indexing and search has been replaced with the Baloo framework based on Xapian.

<text>Luganville is the second largest city in Vanuatu after the capital Port Vila; it is located on the island of Espiritu Santo and has a population of 18,062 as of the 2020 census. Those on Vanuatu&#x27;s northern islands who regard Luganville as their big city, particularly indigenous populations, call it Santo; rural residents of Espiritu Santo call it Kanal (from the former French name &quot;Canal du Segond&quot;). Luganville served as a major base of operations for American troops during World War II.
Boulevard Higinson, the main street that runs through Luganville, contains mainly tourist boutiques and general stores. During WWII, the Americans used the Espiritu Santo as a military base; as a result of the occupation, Boulevard Higinson is unusually wide, as a base commander insisted that four tanks should be able to drive along the road simultaneously. At one end of Higinson is the port, one of two main ports for the island.

==History==
===World War II===
During World War II, the American military erected two bases on two islands of what is now Vanuatu (a British-French colony known then as New Hebrides), one of which being Espiritu Santo. A village of small, spaced-out communities was established into one city: Luganville. Base Button is the largest U.S. base in the South Pacific, covering 38 miles, and was used mainly for maintenance and supply storage. Luganville was a major part of preparing American units for the Guadalcanal campaign. Four airfields were built; Palikulo Bay Airfield, Turtle Bay Airfield, and Luganville Airfield no longer exist, but the Bomber 3 was turned into Santo-Pekoa International Airport. Other facilities built were five military hospitals, Luganville Seaplane Base, Pontoon Wharf, a floating drydock, and thousands of Quonset huts.

Luganville is home to the South Pacific WWII Museum dedicated to preserving the history of World War II across the South Pacific region initiated in 2012 by the mayor Peter Sakita.

===Independence===
By the second half of the 20th century, Luganville was largely French-speaking and initially resisted the attempts to gain independence leading up to its declaration on July 30, 1980. French troops initially attempted to quash the flag-raising in Luganville, but returned to France in August instead. Some unrest arose between political parties vying for power, but has since been largely peaceful.

==Population==
As of the 2016 census, 98.7% of Luganville was of Melanesian and/or Ni-Vanuatu descent. Those of non-Melanesian descent are a minority and are European, other Pacific Islander, and Asian peoples.

Part of the city is formed by squatted informal settlements such as La Milice, Mango, Pepsi, Rowok, Sarakata and St Michel. Mango was first settled by Vietnamese migrants who constructed shelters out of scrap metal left behind by the United States Army. The Vietnamese were repatriated in the 1960s and it was then occupied by Ni-Vanuatu migrants.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Luganville&#x27;s economy suffered after Vanuatu declared independence in 1980. It has a strong tourist industry, namely in the areas of World War II artifacts and scuba diving (SS President Coolidge is a popular site as are the coral reefs), and is a destination for many cruise lines. Its other main industries are agriculture, cattle, and offshore financial services. The market along Boulevard Higinson is popular for its inexpensive food.
Northern Provincial Hospital is one of two main referring hospitals on Espiritu Santo and serves people from other northern islands in Vanuatu as well as its own residents. Luganville is home to Vanuatu Health Training Institute, one of the two medical training schools on the island, but there are not enough graduates to prevent a shortage of medical professionals. Though medical expenses make up 50% of the government&#x27;s budget, the hospital still relies heavily on donations.

There are six main banking organizations in Luganville: Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, Wanfuteng Bank, the National Bank of Vanuatu, Bank South Pacific, BRED Bank, and ANZ Bank.

Broadband internet was not available in Luganville until late 2006.

==Transportation==
Luganville is one of Vanuatu&#x27;s busiest ports, especially as a transshipment point for copra, coconut oil, and cacao. Canal du Segond, the body of water separating the main island and Luganville from Aore Island, provides the town with an excellent sheltered harbour. The town is served by Santo-Pekoa International Airport, the second largest airport in Vanuatu. The city is also serviced by a number of taxis, buses, and public transport trucks.

== Climate ==
Luganville features a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. The town features relatively constant temperatures year-round, with average temperature hovering around . Average precipitation is roughly annually.
==Twin towns – sister cities==
Luganville is twinned with:
* - Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia 
* - Mont-Dore, New Caledonia
* - Honiara, Solomon Islands
* - Port Vila, Vanuatu
* - Honolulu, Hawaii, United States
* - Wanshan Archipelago, Guangdong, China
* - Bundaberg, Australia

<text>Datacasting (data broadcasting) is the transmission of data over a wide area using radio waves. It typically refers to supplemental information sent by television stations alongside digital terrestrial television (DTT) signals. However, datacasting can also be applied to digital data signals carried on analog TV or radio broadcasts.

== Overview ==

Datacasting often provides a variety of information such as news, weather forecasting, traffic reporting, stock market updates, and other data that may or may not relate to the broadcast programs. It can also include interactive elements like gaming, shopping, or educational content. An electronic program guide is typically included, though this feature is sometimes considered inherent to the digital broadcast standard.

The ATSC, DVB, and ISDB standards support broadband datacasting via Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT), although the specifics of implementation are not always defined. For analog TV, moderate and low bandwidths are used via overscan and the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI), respectively. DirectBand and RDS/RBDS are medium and narrow subcarriers used for analog FM radio. The EUREKA 147 and HD Radio standards both allow for datacasting on digital radio, defining a few basics but also allowing for later expansion.

The term IP Datacasting (IPDC) is used in DVB-H for the technical elements required to send IP packets over DVB-H broadband downstream channel combined with a return channel over a mobile communications network such as GPRS or UMTS. The set of specifications for IP Datacast (phase1) was approved by the DVB project in October 2005.

==Datacasting services around the world==
===North America===
====Ambient Information Network====
Ambient Information Network, a datacasting network owned by Ambient Devices presently hosted by U.S.A. Mobility, a U.S. paging service which focuses on information of interest to the local (or larger) area, such as weather and stock indices, and personalized information will be provided with a paid ambient subscription on that particular device. 

====RBDS====
A slight variation of the European Radio Data System, RBDS is carried on a 57 kHz subcarrier on FM radio stations. While originally intended for program-associated data, it can also be used for datacasting purposes including paging and dGPS.

====DirectBand====
DirectBand, owned by Microsoft, uses the 67.65 kHz subcarrier leased from FM radio stations. This subcarrier delivers about 12 kbit/s (net after error correction) of data per station, for over 100 MB per day per city. Data includes traffic, sports, weather, stocks, news, movie times, calendar appointments, and local time.

====MovieBeam====
The now- MovieBeam service used dNTSC technology by Dotcast to transmit 720p HDTV movies in the lower vestigial sideband of NTSC analog TV. The set-top box stored the movies to be viewed on demand for a fee. This was distributed through PBS&#x27;s National Datacast.

====TV Guide On Screen====
TV Guide On Screen is an advertising-supported datacast sent by one local station in each media market. It supplements or replaces the limited electronic program guide sent by each TV station, which is already mandated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

====ATSC-M/H====
ATSC-M/H is yet another mobile TV standard, although it is transmitted and controlled by the broadcasters instead of a third party, and is therefore mostly free-to-air (although it can also be subscription-based). From a technical standpoint, it is an IP-encapsulated datacast of MPEG-4 streaming video, alongside the ATSC MPEG transport stream used for terrestrial television broadcasting. Heavy error correction, separate from that native to ATSC, compensates for ATSC&#x27;s poor mobile (and often fixed) reception.

====UpdateTV====
UpdateTV is a service used by some brands of TV sets and other ATSC tuners to update their firmware via over-the-air programming. This is also transmitted on PBS stations via National Datacast.

===Australia===

Australian broadcast infrastructure company Broadcast Australia undertook a three-year trial in Sydney of a datacasting service using the DVB-T system for use in Australia. 

The trial consisted of a number of services on one standard 7 MHz multiplex, collectively known as &quot;Digital Forty Four&quot;.

The collection included:

* A combined program guide for the free-to-air broadcasters (Channel 4)
* ABC news, sport, and weather items (Channel 41)
* Channel NSW (link) Government and Public Information, including real time traffic information and life surf webcam images (Channel 45)
* Australian Christian Channel (Channel 46)
* Expo Home Shopping (Channel 49) and 
* Federal parliamentary audio broadcasts.

More recently a near-Australia wide broadcast of a datacasting channel called MyTalk commenced on April 13, 2007. Broadcasting as part of the multiplex on Southern Cross and Southern Cross Ten stations, it provided news, weather and other information, available free to anyone able to tune in. The stream consisted of text applicable to the viewer&#x27;s location and a 4:3 video window of terrestrial TV from the relevant Southern Cross/Southern Cross Ten station.

On February 25, 2008, MyTalk ceased broadcasting. Digital Forty Four was shut down at exactly midnight on the night of April 30, 2010.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysian multi-channel pay-TV operator, MiTV Corporation Sdn Bhd launched its IP-over-UHF service in September 2005. The full digital broadcast capacity was used to deliver IP services which such as multicast streaming and datacasting.

=== Middle East ===
Toosheh, or &quot;Knapsack&quot; in Persian is a datacasting technology that uses existing set-top-boxes for reception of files without requiring an Internet connection. No special equipment is required, the transmission is in the form of a standard video stream containing embedded data that is &#x27;recorded&#x27; to a USB stick and then viewed using special software on a PC.

=== South Africa ===
Mindset Network has developed an IP satellite datacast platform for the distribution of educational and health content, to sites around South Africa and the rest of Africa as well. The model is a forward and store model, allowing users of the platform to view content in an on-demand fashion. Content distributed in this way includes video content, print-based content (in the form of PDF files), and interactive computer-based multimedia content.

Significantly, the model also includes access to a GPRS network that allows the receiving sites to communicate back to the Mindset central server. Communications include statistics about the physical health of the machine (e.g. power status, disk drive usage), as well as usage statistics indicating what content has been viewed.

The model also includes a distributed deployment of the Moodle LMS, allowing users to take assessments and have the results transmitted via GPRS to the Mindset server for accreditation.

=== United Kingdom ===

Teletext was used extensively on analogue channels; a type of datacasting using the overscan on analogue transmissions. Teletext Limited and Ceefax were the main providers. Within digital terrestrial television, the Digital Teletext name is used extensively although the technology used to provide this service is unrelated and uses the MHEG-5 UK profile.

=== Worldwide ===

====Blockstream Satellite====
Blockstream Satellite broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain via a global network of broadcast satellites. It also gives everyone the ability to transmit arbitrary files at low cost which can be received in total anonymity worldwide by anyone with a standard DVB-S2 receiver card or USB adapter.

====Outernet====
Outernet&#x27;s goal is to provide free access to content from the web through geostationary and Low Earth orbit satellites, made available effectively to all parts of the world. The project uses datacasting and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) through both small satellites, such as CubeSats, and larger, more conventional geostationary communications satellites in a satellite constellation network. Wi-Fi enabled devices would communicate with the satellite hotspots, which receive data broadcasts from satellites.

== Advantages over Internet transmission ==

Datacasting has certain advantages over using the Internet, specifically concerning privacy and censorship resistance, which can be considered important in an era of mass surveillance. 

Both satellite and terrestrial broadcast multiplexes can carry multicast IP data. This can be forwarded onto a LAN with a suitable receiver, such as a low-cost set-top-box running custom firmware. The software to transmit web pages over multicast is fairly easy to implement; some of the technology has been already developed. Content received can be stored automatically on the set-top box&#x27;s built in hard drive, served to users over Wi-Fi or Ethernet. A fractional broadcast multiplex can transmit up to hundreds of gigabytes of content each day.

=== Privacy ===

In extreme cases a receiver can be physically disconnected from the Internet, thus providing a system much more secure than Internet-based anonymity networks such as Tor. This could ultimately put a complete stop to law enforcement attempts to censor material on the darknet and making many censorship laws virtually impossible to enforce; thus restoring some of the &#x27;anarchic freedom&#x27; of the early days of the Internet.

=== Censorship ===

It is much more difficult, on a technical and political level to jam a satellite signal compared to blocking a website. Data streams can be transmitted alongside television channels. An attempt to jam the data stream will end up jamming the TV stations as well.

=== Efficiency ===

Despite the very high cost of satellite bandwidth, broadcasting to hundreds of thousands or millions of receivers may well be cheaper than using the Internet. No build-out and maintenance of costly physical infrastructure (e.g. fiber optic cables) is required for the end-user, only a satellite dish or TV antenna is necessary, allowing services such as educational materials to be delivered to underserved communities.

<doc id="1274164" wikidata="Q1445615" url="?curid=1274164" title="Index on Censorship">
<text>Index on Censorship is an organisation campaigning for freedom of expression. It produces a quarterly magazine of the same name from London. It is directed by the non-profit-making Writers and Scholars International, Ltd (WSI) in association with the UK-registered charity Index on Censorship (founded as the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust), which are both chaired by the British television broadcaster, writer and former politician Trevor Phillips. The current CEO is Jemimah Steinfeld.

WSI was created by poet Stephen Spender, Oxford philosopher Stuart Hampshire, the publisher and editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; David Astor, and the writer and expert on the Soviet Union Edward Crankshaw. The founding editor of &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; was the critic and translator Michael Scammell (1972–1981), who still serves as a patron of the organisation.

== Founding history ==
===An Appeal from the USSR===

The original impetus for the creation of &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; came from an Open Letter addressed &quot;To World Public Opinion&quot; by two Soviet dissenters, Pavel Litvinov and Larisa Bogoraz. In the words of the samizdat periodical &quot;A Chronicle of Current Events&quot;, they described &quot;the atmosphere of illegality&quot; surrounding the January 1968 trial of Ginzburg and Galanskov and called for &quot;public condemnation of this disgraceful trial, for the punishment of those responsible, the release of the accused from detention and a retrial which would fully conform with the legal regulations and be held in the presence of international observers.&quot; (One of the accused Alexander Ginzburg resumed his dissident activities on release from the camps, until expelled from the USSR in 1979; another, the writer Yuri Galanskov, died in a camp in November 1972.)

&quot;The Times&quot; (London) published a translation of the Open Letter and in reply the English poet Stephen Spender composed a brief telegram:

“We, a group of friends representing no organisation, support your statement, admire your courage, think of you and will help in any way possible.”

Among the other 15 British and US signatories were the poet W. H. Auden, philosopher A. J. Ayer, musician Yehudi Menuhin, man of letters J. B. Priestley, actor Paul Scofield, sculptor Henry Moore, philosopher Bertrand Russell, writer Mary McCarthy and composer Igor Stravinsky.

Later that year, on 25 August, Bogoraz, Litvinov and five others demonstrated on Red Square against the invasion of Czechoslovakia.

A few weeks before, Litvinov sent Spender a letter (translated and published several years later in the first May 1972 issue of &quot;Index&quot;). He suggested that a regular publication might be set up in the West &quot;to provide information to world public opinion about the real state of affairs in the USSR&quot;.

===Title, scope and relations with Amnesty International===
Spender and his colleagues, Stuart Hampshire, David Astor, Edward Crankshaw and founding editor Michael Scammell decided, like Amnesty International, to cast their net wider. They wished to document patterns of censorship in right-wing dictatorships — the military regimes of Latin America and the dictatorships in Greece, Spain and Portugal — as well as the Soviet Union and its satellites.

Meanwhile, in 1971, Amnesty International began to publish English translations of each new issue of &quot;A Chronicle of Current Events&quot;, which documented human rights abuses in the USSR and included a regular &quot;Samizdat Update&quot;. In a recent interview, Michael Scammell explains the informal division of labour between the two London-based organisations: &quot;When we received human rights material we forwarded it to Amnesty and when Amnesty received a report of censorship they passed it on to us&quot;.

Originally, as suggested by Scammell, the magazine was to be called &quot;Index&quot;, a reference to the lists or indices of banned works that are central to the history of censorship: the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books); the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Censor&#x27;s Index&quot;; and apartheid South Africa&#x27;s &quot;Jacobsens Index of Objectionable Literature&quot;.

Scammell later admitted that the words &quot;on censorship&quot; were added as an afterthought when it was realised that the reference would not be clear to many readers. &quot;Panicking, we hastily added the words &#x27;on Censorship&#x27; as a subtitle&quot;, wrote Scammell in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, &quot;and this it has remained ever since, nagging me with its ungrammaticality (Index &quot;of&quot; Censorship, surely) and a standing apology for the opacity of its title.&quot;

Describing the organisation&#x27;s objectives at its inception, Stuart Hampshire said:

&quot;the tyrant&#x27;s concealments of oppression and of absolute cruelty should always be challenged. There should be noise of publicity outside every detention centre and concentration camp and a published record of every tyrannical denial of free expression.&quot;

== The magazine ==
&quot;Index on Censorship&quot; magazine was founded by Michael Scammell in 1972. It supports free expression, publishing distinguished writers from around the world, exposing suppressed stories, initiating debate, and providing an international record of censorship. The quarterly editions of the magazine usually focus on a country or region or a recurring theme in the global free expression debate. &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; also publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers. &quot;Index Index&quot;, a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, was published in the magazine until December 2008.

While the original inspiration to create Index came from Soviet dissidents, from its outset the magazine covered censorship in right-wing dictatorships then ruling Greece and Portugal, the military regimes of Latin America, and the Soviet Union and its satellites. The magazine has covered other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and Internet censorship.

In the first issue of May 1972, Stephen Spender wrote:
&quot;Obviously there is the risk of a magazine of this kind becoming a bulletin of frustration. However, the material by writers which is censored in Eastern Europe, Greece, South Africa and other countries is among the most exciting that is being written today. Moreover, the question of censorship has become a matter of impassioned debate; and it is one which does not only concern totalitarian societies.&quot;
Accordingly, the magazine has sought to shed light on other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and internet censorship. Issues are usually organised by theme, and contain a country-by-country list of recent cases involving censorship, restrictions on freedom of the press and other free speech violations. Occasionally, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers as well as censored ones.

Over the half century it has been in existence, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; has presented works by some of the world&#x27;s most distinguished writers and thinkers, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Milan Kundera, Václav Havel, Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Arthur Miller, Noam Chomsky, and Umberto Eco.

Issues under the editorship of Jemimah Steinfeld featured investigations into how the UK&#x27;s royal family censor their archives, the plight of Afghan journalists and the rise of Narendra Modi. The editor before, Rachael Jolley, looked at taboos, the legacy of the Magna Carta and Shakespeare&#x27;s legacy in protest. There have been special issues on China, reporting from the Middle East, and on internet censorship. The Russia issue (January 2008) won an Amnesty International Media Award 2008 for features by Russian journalists Fatima Tlisova and Sergei Bachinin, and veteran Russian free speech campaigner Alexei Simonov, founder of the Glasnost Defence Foundation.

Since January 2010 it has been published by SAGE Publications, an independent for-profit academic publisher. Between 2005 and 2009, the magazine was published and distributed by Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis group.

In addition to print and annual subscriptions, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; is available on Exact Editions, an application for the iPhone/iPad and Android.

It is also a partner with Eurozine, a network of more than 60 European cultural journals.

== Publishing landmarks ==

Other landmark publications include Ken Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s writings from prison (Issue 3/1997) and a translation of the Czechoslovak Charter 77 manifesto drafted by Václav Havel and others in Issue 3/1977. Index published the first English translation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s Nobel Prize acceptance speech. &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; published the stories of the &quot;disappeared&quot; in Argentina and the work of banned poets in Cuba; the work of Chinese poets who escaped the massacres that ended the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; has a long history of publishing writers in translation, including Bernard-Henri Lévy, Ivan Klima, Ma Jian and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, and news reports including Anna Politkovskaia&#x27;s coverage of the war in Chechnya (Issue 2/2002).

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot; (1977) is set in a Soviet mental institution and was inspired by the personal account of former detainee Victor Fainberg and Clayton Yeo&#x27;s expose of the use of psychiatric abuse in the USSR, published in &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; (Issue 2, 1975). It was first performed with the London Symphony Orchestra. Stoppard became a member of the advisory board of &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; in 1978 and remains connected to the publication as a Patron of &quot;Index&quot;.

&quot;Index on Censorship&quot; published the World Statement by the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie in support of &quot;the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs and to discuss them with their critics on the basis of mutual tolerance, free from censorship, intimidation and violence. Six months later, &quot;Index&quot; published the &quot;Hunger Strike Declaration&quot; from four student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, Hou Dejian and Gao Xin.

&quot;Index Index&quot;, a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, continued to be published in each edition of the magazine until December 2008, when this function was transferred to the website. The offences against free expression documented in that first issue&#x27;s &quot;Index Index&quot; listing included censorship in Greece and Spain, then dictatorships, and Brazil, which had just banned the film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; on the grounds that it &quot;insulted a friendly power&quot; – the United States, where it had been made and freely shown.

&quot;Index on Censorship&quot; paid special attention to the situation in then Czechoslovakia between the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution of 1989, devoting an entire issue to the country eight years after the Prague Spring (Issue 3/1976). It included several pieces by Václav Havel, including a first translation of his one act play &quot;Conversation&quot;, and a letter to Czech officials on police censorship of his December 1975 production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; by John Gay.

The magazine also carried articles on the state of the Czech theatre and a list of the so-called Padlock Publications, 50 banned books that circulated only in typescript. Index also published an English version of Havel&#x27;s play &quot;Mistake&quot;, dedicated to Samuel Beckett in gratitude for Beckett&#x27;s own dedication of his play &quot;Catastrophe&quot; to Havel. Both short plays were performed at the Free Word Centre to mark the launch of Index&#x27;s special issue looking back at the changes of 1989 (Issue 4, 2009).
== Campaigns ==
Index has been the driving force in the UK in the campaign to &quot;StopSLAPPs&quot;, strategic lawsuits against public participation. As a result of their campaigning, in 2024 a private members bill was tabled. 

&quot;Free Speech is not For Sale&quot;, a joint campaign report by Index on Censorship and English PEN highlighted the problem of so-called libel tourism and the English law of defamation&#x27;s chilling effect on free speech. After much debate surrounding the report&#x27;s ten key recommendations, the UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw pledged to make English defamation laws fairer.

&quot;A free press can&#x27;t operate or be effective unless it can offer readers comment as well as news. What concerns me is that the current arrangements are being used by big corporations to restrict fair comment, not always by journalists but also by academics.&quot; He added: &quot;The very high levels of remuneration for defamation lawyers in Britain seem to be incentivising libel tourism.&quot;

These campaigns and others were illustrative of then CEO John Kampfner&#x27;s strategy, supported by then chair Jonathan Dimbleby, to boost Index&#x27;s public advocacy profile in the UK and abroad beginning in 2008. Until then the organisation did not regard itself as &quot;a campaigning organisation in the mould of Article 19 or Amnesty International&quot;, as former news editor Sarah Smith noted in 2001, preferring to use its &quot;understanding of what is newsworthy and politically significant to maintain pressure on oppressive regimes through extensive coverage&quot;.

== Arts and international programmes ==
Index on Censorship also runs a programme of UK based and international projects that put the organisation&#x27;s philosophy into practice. In 2009 and 2010 Index on Censorship worked in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Tunisia and many other countries, in support of journalists, broadcasters, artists and writers who work against a backdrop of intimidation, repression, and censorship.

The organisation&#x27;s arts&#x27; programmes investigate the impact of current and recent social and political change on arts practitioners, assessing the degree and depth of self-censorship. It uses the arts to engage young people directly into the freedom of expression debate. It works with marginalised communities in UK, creating new platforms, on line and actual for creative expression.

Index on Censorship works internationally to commission new work, not only articles for print and online, but also new photography, film &amp; video, visual arts and performance. Examples have included an exhibition of photostories produced by women in Iraq, &quot;Open Shutters&quot;, and a programme involving artists from refugee and migrant communities in UK, linking with artists from their country of origin, &quot;Imagine art after&quot;, exhibited at Tate Britain in 2007.

Index has also worked with Burmese exiled artists and publishers on creating a programme in support of the collective efforts of Burma&#x27;s creative community. Index also commissioned a new play by Actors for Human Rights, &quot;Seven Years With Hard Labour&quot;, weaving together four accounts from former Burmese political prisoners now living in the UK. Index also co-published a book of poetry by homeless people in London and St. Petersburg.

==CEO==
The current Chief Executive of Index on Censorship is Jemimah Steinfeld. She took on this role in May 2024, replacing Ruth Anderson, who left the organisation to follow a political path. 
The Chief Executive of Index on Censorship from 2014 through to 2020 was Jodie Ginsberg, who is now the CEO of the CPJ.

== Freedom of Expression Awards ==

== Controversies ==

=== Theo Van Gogh ===
In November 2004, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; attracted further controversy over another indexonline.org blog post by Jayasekera that, to many readers, seemed to condone or justify the murder of Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh. The blog described Van Gogh was a &quot;free-speech fundamentalist&quot; on a &quot;martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities&quot; in an &quot;abuse of his right to free speech&quot;. Describing Van Gogh&#x27;s film &quot;Submission&quot; as &quot;furiously provocative&quot;, Jayasekera concluded by describing his death:

&quot;A sensational climax to a lifetime&#x27;s public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo Van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo! Bravo!&quot;

There were many protests from both left-wing and right-wing commentators. In December 2004, Nick Cohen of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote:

&quot;When I asked Jayasekera if he had any regrets, he said he had none. He told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn&#x27;t have made the mistake of believing that &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle – in the same way as Amnesty International is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle. It may have been so in its radical youth, but was now as concerned with fighting &#x27;hate speech&#x27; as protecting free speech.&quot;

Ursula Owen, the chief executive of &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, while agreeing that the blog post&#x27;s &quot;tone was not right&quot; contradicted Cohen&#x27;s account of his conversation with Jayasekera in a letter to &quot;The Observer&quot;.

<text>The Royal Fowey Yacht Club is located in a waterfront setting at Fowey, on the south coast of Cornwall one of the UK&#x27;s most secure harbours.

Its antecedents can be traced back to 1880; its third Honorary Secretary, from 1893, was Arthur Quiller-Couch, who became Sir Arthur. The minutes and descriptions of Yacht races, up to 1897 are in his handwriting. Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch filled the post of Commodore from 1911 until 1944 when he was succeeded by Lt. General Sir Frederick Browning, who upon retirement in 1962, was elected the Club&#x27;s first Admiral. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were his personal friends, and visited the Club from the RY Britannia, visiting also him and his wife, the author Daphne du Maurier, at their home at Menabilly, (which became &quot;Manadalay&quot; in her book, &quot;Rebecca&quot;).

In 1905 permission was granted for the Club to include in its insignia the Coronet of the Duke of Cornwall over the Shield of the Duchy of Cornwall and in 1907 the King approved the use of the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in the name of the Club.

<text>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up. Squats also help the hip muscles.

Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus. The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.

The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise programs. In powerlifting, it is categorized as raw squats or equipped squats which involves wearing a squat suit.

==Form==

The squat begins from a standing position. Weight is often added and is typically in the form of a loaded barbell. Dumbbells and kettlebells may also be used. When a barbell is used, it may be braced across the upper trapezius muscle, which is termed a &quot;high bar squat&quot;, or held lower across the back and rear deltoids, termed a &quot;low bar squat&quot;. Wherever the bar is positioned on the back, various torso bracing actions are taken to ensure that it does not come into direct contact with the spine as this can lead to discomfort and injury. This can be a problem for new squatters who squat in a &quot;high bar&quot; style as they may not have enough muscle mass to form a cushion for the bar and prevent it from applying pressure directly to their spine. A barbell pad can be used to help alleviate pressure or a &quot;low bar&quot; style can be used. The squatting movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position.

Squats can be performed to varying depths. The competition standard is for the crease of the hip (top surface of the leg at the hip joint) to fall below the top of the knee; this is colloquially known as &quot;parallel&quot; depth. Although it may be confusing, many other definitions for &quot;parallel&quot; depth abound, none of which represents the standard in organized powerlifting. From shallowest to deepest, these other standards are: bottom of hamstring parallel to the ground; the hip joint itself below the top of the knee, or femur parallel to the floor; and the top of the upper thigh (i.e., top of the quadriceps) below the top of the knee. Squatting below parallel is considered a full or deep squat, while squatting above it qualifies as shallow. Though the forces on the ACL and PCL decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the menisci and articular cartilages in the knee peak at these same high angles. This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine.

As the body descends, the hips and knees undergo flexion, the ankle extends (dorsiflexes) and muscles around the joint contract eccentrically, reaching maximal contraction at the bottom of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles concentrically, and the hips and knees undergo extension while the ankle plantarflexes.

Common errors of squat form include descending too rapidly and flexing the torso too far forward. Rapid descent risks being unable to complete the lift or causing injury. This occurs when the descent causes the squatting muscles to relax and tightness at the bottom is lost as a result. Over-flexing the torso greatly increases the forces exerted on the lower back, risking a spinal disc herniation. Another error is when the knee is not aligned with the direction of the toes, entering a valgus position, which can adversely stress the knee joint. An additional common error is the raising of heels off the floor, which reduces the contribution of the gluteus muscles.

==Muscles used==
Agonist muscles
* Quadriceps femoris
* Vastus lateralis
* Vastus medialis oblique
* Gluteus maximus
* Adductor magnus
* Soleus

Stabilizing muscles
* Erector spinae
* Rectus abdominis
* Internal and external obliques
* Hamstrings (Biceps femoris, semitendinosis, semimembranosis)
* Gluteus medius and minimus
* Gastrocnemius

==Equipment==

Various types of equipment can be used to perform squats.

A power cage can be used to reduce risk of injury and eliminate the need for a spotting partner. By putting the bar on a track, the Smith machine reduces the role of hip movement in the squat and in this sense resembles a leg press. The monolift rack allows an athlete to perform a squat without having to take a couple of steps back with weight on as opposed to conventional racks. Not many powerlifting federations allow monolift in competitions (WPO, GPC, IPO).

Other equipment used can include a weight lifting belt to support the torso and boards to wedge beneath the ankles to improve stability and allow a deeper squat (weightlifting shoes also have wooden wedges built into the sole to achieve the same effect). Wrist straps are another piece of recommended equipment; they support the wrist and help to keep it in a straightened position. They should be wrapped around the wrist, above and below the joint, thus limiting movement of the joint. Heel wedges and related equipment are discouraged by some as they are thought to worsen form over the long term. The barbell can also be cushioned with a special padded sleeve, called a barbell pad. This helps to reduce pressure from the steel barbell on the back.

Chains and thick elastic bands can be attached to either end of the barbell in order to vary resistance at different phases of the movement. This may be done to increase resistance in the stronger upper phase of the movement in order to better meet a person&#x27;s 1RM for that phase. Bands can also be used to reduce resistance in the lower weaker phase by being hung from a power rack and the barbell being increasingly supported by them as it is lowered. This can help someone to overcome a &#x27;sticking&#x27; point. A squat performed using these techniques is called a variable resistance squat.

==Variants==

The squat has a number of variants, some of which can be combined:

===Barbell===

*Back squat – the bar is held on the back of the body upon the upper trapezius muscle, near to the base of the neck. Alternatively, it may be held lower across the upper back and rear deltoids. In powerlifting the barbell is often held in a lower position in order to create a lever advantage, while in weightlifting it is often held in a higher position which produces a posture closer to that of the clean and jerk. These variations are called low bar (or powerlifting squat) and high bar (or Olympic squat), respectively.
**Sumo squat – A variation of the back squat where the feet are placed slightly wider than shoulder width apart and the feet pointed outwards.
**Box squat – at the bottom of the motion the squatter will sit down on a bench or other type of support then rise again. The box squat is commonly utilized by powerlifters to train the squat.
*Front squat – the barbell is held in front of the body across the clavicles and deltoids in either a clean grip, as is used in weightlifting, or with the arms crossed and hands placed on top of the barbell. In addition to the muscles used in the back squat, the front squat also uses muscles of the upper back such as the trapezius to support the bar.
*Hack squat – the barbell is held in the hands just behind the legs; this exercise was first known as Hacke (heel) in Germany. According to European strength sports expert and Germanist Emmanuel Legeard this name was derived from the original form of the exercise where the heels were joined. The hack squat was thus a squat performed the way Prussian soldiers used to click their heels (&quot;Hacken zusammen&quot;). The hack squat was popularized in the English-speaking countries by early 1900s wrestler George Hackenschmidt. It is also called a &quot;rear deadlift&quot;. It is different from the hack squat performed with the use of a squat machine.
*Overhead squat – the barbell is held overhead in a wide-arm snatch grip; however, it is also possible to use a closer grip if balance allows.

*Zercher squat – the barbell is held in the crooks of the arms, on the inside of the elbow. One method of performing this is to deadlift the barbell, hold it against the thighs, squat into the lower portion of the squat, and then hold the bar on the thighs as you position the crook of your arm under the bar and then stand up. This sequence is reversed once the desired number of repetitions has been performed. Named after Ed Zercher, a 1930s strongman.
*Steinborn squat – named after the traditional strongman Henry &#x27;Milo&#x27; Steinborn, this unique and risky variation literally turns the squat sideways. The complex lift requires an athlete to stand the barbell up so that is perpendicular to the ground and position themselves underneath. Then, they&#x27;ll pull the barbell like a lever down across their upper back and receive the load in the squatted position. From there, the lifter must stand the weight up, perform some squats, and return the barbell to the floor in the same reverse fashion that they picked it up. 
*Deep knee bend on toes – it is similar to a normal back squat only the lifter is positioned on their forefeet and toes, with their heels raised, throughout the repetition. Usually, the weight used is not more than moderate in comparison to a flat footed, heavy back squat.
*Single leg squat - The single leg squat (SLS), also known as a unilateral squat, involves squatting with one leg instead of two (which is a bilateral squat). Usually the leg which is held off the ground moves behind the person as they squat, but alternatively the person may position it ahead of themselves. Bilateral split squats which significantly increase the work performed by the front leg are sometimes erroneously referred to as single leg squats due to this emphasis. Single leg squats can be used to strengthen a person&#x27;s stabilizer muscles more so than two legged squats and improve their ability to balance. They can also be used to remove muscle imbalances in the body by ensuring that, when performed alternatively, the right and left leg do the same amount of work. In comparison to two footed squats, the barbell weight only needs to be half of what it would be, minus the lifter&#x27;s weight for the legs to perform the same amount of work i.e. for a 80 kg lifter, lifting 40 kg using only the left leg, means the left leg is lifting the equivalent of what it does in a two footed squat with 160 kg. This means that the single leg squat can be used in rehabilitation programmes where there is a need to avoid heavier loading of the back. 
*Loaded squat jump – the barbell is positioned similarly to a back squat. The exerciser squats down, before moving upwards into a jump, and then landing in approximately the same position. The loaded squat jump is a form of loaded plyometric exercise used to increase explosive power. Variations of this exercise may involve the use of a trap bar or dumbbells.
*Variable resistance squat – In keeping with variable resistance training in general, a variable resistance squat involves altering the resistance during the movement in order that it better matches, in percentage terms, the respective 1RM for each strength phase the person is moving through i.e. more resistance in the higher stronger phase and less in the weaker lower phase e.g. 60 kg in the lower phase and 90 kg in the higher phase. Such an alteration of resistance can be achieved by the use of heavy chains which are attached to either end of the barbell. The chains are gradually lifted from the floor as the barbell is raised and vice versa when it is lowered. Thick elastic bands which are more stretched in the higher phase and less stretched in the lower phase can also be used. Combining heavier partial reps with lighter full reps can also help to train the stronger and weaker phases of the movement so the percentage of 1RM lifted for each phase respectively is more similar. Training with variable resistance squats is a technique used to increase speed and explosive power.
*Partial rep – Partial rep squats only move through a partial range of movement when compared with full squats which move through a full range of movement. Full range for a squat usually means the higher stronger phase of a squat&#x27;s strength phase sequence (strength curve), but may also refer to just squatting for the lower weaker phase. When partial squats are used to strengthen the higher ROM this usually involves significantly increasing the weight in comparison to the weight used for a full squat. The percentage lifted of the stronger higher phase&#x27;s 1RM can therefore be increased and not limited by the requirement to move through the weaker lower range of movement e.g. a person lifts 100% of his 1RM for the higher stronger phase which is 150 kg. If he did a full squat he would only have been able to do about 66% of his stronger phases 1RM because his 1RM for a full squat, including the weaker lower phase, is 100 kg. Training with heavier partial squats can help to improve general strength and power. It can also be more beneficial for sports and athletics as that ROM is more likely to be required in those activities i.e. it is rare to need to perform a full squat in sport, whereas partial squatting happens frequently. Partial squatting with a heavier weight than a full squat allows for can also help to improve a person&#x27;s 1RM for a full squat. When partial squatting only the lower phase this is usually to strengthen that relatively weak phase of the lift in order to overcome a sticking point i.e. a point a person gets &quot;stuck&quot; at and finds it difficult to progress past. It is commonly recommended that partial squats are best used in conjunction with full squats.

===Lunge===
*Split squat – an assisted one-legged squat where the non-lifting leg is rested on the ground a few steps behind the lifter, as if it were a static lunge.
*Bulgarian split squat – performed similarly to a split squat, but the foot of the non-lifting leg is rested on a platform behind the lifter.

===Other===
*Belt squat – is an exercise performed the same as other squat variations except the weight is attached to a hip belt i.e. a dip belt
*Goblet squat – a squat performed while holding a kettlebell or dumbbell on to one&#x27;s chest and abdomen with both hands.
*Smith squat – a squat using a Smith machine.
* Machine hack squat – using a squat machine.
*Trap bar squat – a trap bar is held in the hands while squats are performed. More commonly referred to as &quot;trap bar deadlifts.&quot;
*Monolift squat – a squat using a monolift rack.

*Safety squat – a squat performed using a &quot;safety squat bar&quot; which has a camber in the middle, two handles, and padding. The use of a safety squat bar may help to reduce the risk of causing or aggravating an injury.

*Anderson squat - (aka Pin Squat, Bottoms Up Squat) starting the squat from the bottom position.

===Body-weight===
*Body-weight or air squat – done with no weight or barbell, often at higher repetitions than other variants.
*Overhead squat – a non-weight bearing variation of the squat exercise, with the hands facing each other overhead, biceps aligned with the ears, and feet hip-width apart. This exercise is a predictor of total-body flexibility, mobility, and possible lower body dysfunction.
*Hindu squat – also called a baithak, or a deep knee bend on toes. It is performed without additional weight, and body weight placed on the forefeet and toes with the heels raised throughout; during the movement the knees track far past the toes. The baithak was a staple exercise of ancient Indian wrestlers. It was also used by Bruce Lee in his training regime. It may also be performed with the hands resting on an upturned club or the back of a chair.
*Jump squat – a plyometrics exercise where the squatter engages in a rapid eccentric contraction and jumps forcefully off the floor at the top of the range of motion.

*Basic single leg squat – the person stands with one foot on the ground and the other foot raised. They bend their standing leg and move downwards. Their raised leg moves behind them with the knee coming close to the heel of the grounded foot. Due to the extra effort required to balance, one legged squats can help to additionally improve a person&#x27;s sense of balance. As with other forms of one legged exercise performed alternately, they can also help to mitigate against an excessive strength variation between the legs, as both legs are made to perform the same level of work e.g. in a two legged squat a person&#x27;s right leg may do 55% of the work and their left leg 45%, which may result in an excessively uneven level of strength developing. By switching between using the right leg and left leg in one legged squats, a person can better ensure that each leg is doing the same level of work i.e. the right or left leg does 100% of the work for each respective one legged squat.

*Pistol squat – a bodyweight single leg squat done to full depth, while the other leg is extended off the floor and positioned somewhere in front. Sometimes dumbbells, kettlebells or medicine balls are added for resistance. Pistol squats may be performed with the foot flat on the floor or with the heel raised.

*Shrimp squat – also called the &quot;flamingo squat&quot;, a version of the pistols squat where instead of extending the non-working leg out in front, it is bent and placed behind the working leg while squatting, perhaps held behind in a hand. Shrimp squats may be performed with the foot flat on the floor or with the heel raised.
*Jockey squat - a half-squat, performed by being balanced on the forefeet throughout the repetition, with fingertips touching across the chest. This squat can be performed quickly and in high repetitions.

*Sissy squat – the knees travel over the toes, stretching the quadriceps and the body leans backwards. Can be done in a special sissy squat machine, and can also be weighted.
*Sumo Squat - also known as &quot;Plie Squat&quot;, in this variation legs are wider than shoulder width.

==Clinical significance==
The squat is a large muscle-mass resistance exercise. As such, squats produce acute increases in testosterone (especially in men) and growth hormone (especially in women). Although insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is not raised acutely by squat exercise, resistance-trained men and women have higher resting IGF-1. Catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) are acutely elevated by resistance exercise, such as squats.

The squat has been used in clinical settings to strengthen lower body musculature with little or no harm after joint-related injury. Young people may benefit by enhanced athletic performance and reduced injury as they mature, and movement competency can ensure independent living in the elderly.

==Injury considerations==
Although the squat has long been a basic element of weight training, it has not been without controversy over its safety.

Some trainers claim that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees. Others, however, continue to advocate the squat as one of the best exercises for building muscle and strength. Some coaches maintain that incomplete squats (those terminating above parallel) are both less effective and more likely to cause injury than full squat (terminating with hips at or below knee level).

A 2013 review concluded that deep squats performed with proper technique do not lead to increased rates of degenerative knee injuries and are an effective exercise. The same review also concluded that shallower squats may lead to degeneration in the lumbar spine and knees in the long-term.

===Squats used in physical therapy===
Squats can be used for some rehabilitative activities because they hone stability without excessive compression on the tibiofemoral joint and anterior cruciate ligament.

Deeper squats are associated with higher compressive loads on patellofemoral joint and it is possible that people who suffer from pain in this joint cannot squat at increased depths. For some knee rehabilitation activities, patients might feel more comfortable with knee flexion between 0 and 50 degrees because it places less force compared to deeper depths. Another study shows that decline squats at angles higher than 16 degrees may not be beneficial for the knee and fail to decrease calf tension. Other studies have indicated that the best squat to hone the quadriceps, without inflaming the patellofemoral joint, occurs between 0 and 50 degrees.

A combination of single-limb squats and decline angles has been used to rehabilitate knee extensors. Conducting squats at a declined angle allows the knee to flex despite possible pain or lack of mobilization in the ankle. If therapists are looking to focus on the knee during squats, one study shows that doing single-limb squats at a 16-degree decline angle has the greatest activation of the knee extensors without placing excessive pressure on the ankles. This same study also found that a 24-degree decline angle can be used to strengthen ankles and knee extensors.

Different Sets For Squats

Forced repetitions are used when training until failure. They are completed by completing an additional 2–4 reps (assisted) at the end of the set. Partial repetitions are also used in order to maintain a constant period of tension in order to promote hypertrophy. Lastly, drop-sets are an intense workout done at the end of a set which runs until failure and continues with a lower weight without rest.

<text>Louise Forestier (born Louise Belhumeur on August 10, 1942) is a Canadian singer, songwriter and actress.

==Biography==
Born in Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada, Forestier was trained in acting at the National Theatre School in Montreal, but it was as a singer that she first became known in 1966, when she received the Renée Claude Trophy from Le Patriote, a &quot;boîte à chansons&quot; in east-end Montreal, and was named Discovery of the Year on the Radio-Canada TV program &quot;Jeunesse Oblige&quot;.

In 1968 she was part of the extraordinarily successful revue &quot;L&#x27;Osstidcho&quot;, followed the next year by &quot;L&#x27;Osstidchomeurt&quot; with Robert Charlebois, Yvon Deschamps and Mouffe. She and Charlebois recorded the landmark song &quot;Lindberg&#x27;&quot; and toured France in 1969.

In April 1970 Forestier starred in the Michel Tremblay, François Dompierre musical, &quot;Demain matin Montréal m&#x27;attend&quot;. She continued with acting, appearing in Jacques Godbout&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;IXE-13&quot;, singing on the original film score.

Forestier topped the Quebec charts in 1973 with a version of the folk song &quot;La Prison de Londres&quot;, performed with guitarist Claude Lafrance, and pianist Jacques Perron. With this song Forestier started to turn away from the hard rock of her early career to a repertoire largely inspired by Quebec folk music, and to a more personal style, which she continued through the 1970s.

In 1980 Forestier played Marie-Jeanne, the &quot;robot waitress&quot; in the Montreal production Luc Plamondon, Michel Berger rock opera Starmania. Two years later, with Plamondon as producer, she staged the hit show &quot;Je suis au rendez-vous&quot;. This was the first of a series of shows in the 1980s, culminating in an appearance with Belgian singer Maurane as part of the Francofolies de Montréal in 1989.

In 1990 she appeared at the Place-des-Arts in Montreal as Émilie Nelligan, the mother of the poet in the romantic opera &quot;Nelligan&quot; by Michel Tremblay and André Gagnon.

Forestier defended Yann Martel&#x27;s novel &quot;Histoire de Pi&quot; in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, which was broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004.

In March 2019, she was one of 11 singers from Quebec, alongside Ginette Reno, Diane Dufresne, Céline Dion, Isabelle Boulay, Luce Dufault, Laurence Jalbert, Catherine Major, Ariane Moffatt, Marie Denise Pelletier and Marie-Élaine Thibert, who participated in a supergroup recording of Renée Claude&#x27;s 1971 single &quot;Tu trouveras la paix&quot; after Claude&#x27;s diagnosis with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease was announced.

<text>Roman agriculture describes the farming practices of ancient Rome, during a period of over 1000 years. From humble beginnings, the Roman Republic (509 BC–27 BC) and the Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD) expanded to rule much of Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East and thus comprised many agricultural environments of which the Mediterranean climate of dry, hot summers and cool, rainy winter was the most common. Within the Mediterranean area, a triad of crops were most important: grains, olives, and grapes.
The great majority of the people ruled by Rome were engaged in agriculture. From the beginning of small, largely self-sufficient landowners, rural society became dominated by latifundium, large estates owned by the wealthy and utilizing mostly slave labor. The growth in the urban population, especially of the city of Rome, required the development of commercial markets and long-distance trade in agricultural products, especially grain, to supply the people in the cities with food.

==Background==

The main texts of the Greco-Roman agricultural tradition are mostly from the Roman agronomists: Cato the Elder&#x27;s &quot;De agri cultura&quot;, Columella&#x27;s &quot;De re rustica&quot;, Marcus Terentius Varro and Palladius. Attributed to Mago the Carthaginian, the agricultural treatise &quot;Rusticatio&quot;, originally written in Punic and later translated into Greek and Latin, is now lost. Scholars speculate whether this text may have been an early source for agricultural traditions in the Near East and Classical world.

==The &quot;delightful&quot; life==

Agriculture in ancient Rome was not only a necessity but was idealized as a way of life. Cicero considered farming the best of all Roman occupations. In his treatise &quot;On Duties&quot;, he declared that &quot;of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a free man.&quot; When one of his clients was derided in court for preferring a rural lifestyle, Cicero defended country life as &quot;the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice&quot; (&quot;parsimonia&quot;, &quot;diligentia&quot;, &quot;iustitia&quot;). Cato, Columella, Varro and Palladius wrote handbooks on farming practice.

In his treatise &quot;De agricultura&quot; (&quot;On Farming&quot;, 2nd century BC), Cato wrote that the best farms contained a vineyard, followed by an irrigated garden, willow plantation, olive orchard, meadow, grain land, forest trees, vineyard trained on trees, and lastly acorn woodlands. Though Rome relied on resources from its many provinces acquired through conquest and warfare, wealthy Romans developed the land in Italy to produce a variety of crops. &quot;The people living in the city of Rome constituted a huge market for the purchase of food produced on Italian farms.&quot;

Land ownership was a dominant factor in distinguishing the aristocracy from the common person, and the more land a Roman owned, the more important he would be in the city. Soldiers were often rewarded with land from the commander they served. Though farms depended on slave labor, free men and citizens were hired at farms to oversee the slaves and ensure that the farms ran smoothly.

==Crops==
===Grains===
Staple crops in early Rome were millet, and emmer and spelt which are species of wheat. According to the Roman scholar Varro, common wheat and durum wheat were introduced to Italy as crops about 450 BC. Durum (hard) wheat became the preferred grain of urban Romans, because it could be baked into leavened bread and was easier to grow in the Mediterranean region than common (soft) wheat. Grains, especially baked into bread, were the staple of the Roman diet, providing 70 to 80 percent of the calories in an average diet. Barley was also grown extensively, dominating grain production in Greece and on poorer soils where it was more productive than wheat. Wheat was the preferred grain, but barley was widely eaten and also important as animal feed.

In &quot;De re rustica&quot; Columella wrote that emmer was more resistant to moisture than wheat. According to Columella four types of emmer were cultivated, including one variety that he calls Clusian (named for the town Clusium). Cato wrote that if sowing grain in humid or dewy soils was unavoidable, they should be sown alongside turnips, panic grass, millet and rape.
Despite listing panicum and millet among the legumes Columella says they should be considered grain crops &quot;for in many countries the peasants subsist on food made from them&quot;.

===Legumes===
Of legumes, Columella lists some that are preferred for cultivation: lentils, peas, &quot;lupinus&quot;, beans, cowpeas, and chickpeas (also listing sesame, &quot;panicum&quot;, cannabis, barley, and millet as legumes). 

He writes the following about &quot;lupinus&quot;:
...it requires the least labor, costs least, and of all crops that are sown is most beneficial to the land. For it affords an excellent fertilizer for worn out vineyards and ploughlands; it flourishes even in exhausted soil; and it endures age when laid away in the granary. When softened by boiling it is good fodder for cattle during the winter; in the case of humans, too, it serves to warn off famine if years of crop failures come upon them.

===Olives===
The Romans grew olive trees in poor, rocky soils, and often in areas with sparse precipitation. The tree is sensitive to freezing temperatures and intolerant of the colder weather of northern Europe and high, cooler elevations. The olive was grown mostly near the Mediterranean Sea. The consumption of olive oil provided about 12 percent of the calories and about 80 percent of necessary fats in the diet of the average Roman.

===Grapes===
Viticulture was probably brought to southern Italy and Sicily by Greek colonists, but the Phoenicians of Carthage in northern Africa gave the Romans much of their knowledge of growing grapes and making wine. By 160 BC, the cultivation of grapes on large estates using slave labor was common in Italy and wine was becoming a universal drink in the Roman empire. To protect their wine industry, the Romans attempted to prohibit the cultivation of grapes outside Italy, but by the 1st century AD, provinces such as Spain and Gaul (modern-day France) were exporting wine to Italy.

===Fodder===
Columella mentions turnips as important, high-yielding food crop, especially in Gaul where they were used as winter fodder for cattle. As other &quot;fodder crops&quot; he lists Medic clover, vetch, barley, &quot;cytisus&quot;, oats, chickpea and fenugreek. Of Medic clover, he says it improves the soil, fattens lean cattle and is a high-yielding fodder crop. 

Cato the Elder wrote that leaves from poplar, elm and oak leaves should be gathered in the Fall before they have dried completely and stored for use as fodder. Turnips, lupines and forage crops were to be sown after the rainy season.

===Other crops===

The Romans also grew artichoke, mustard, coriander, rocket, chives, leeks, celery, basil, parsnip, mint, rue, thyme &quot;from overseas,&quot; beets, poppy, dill, asparagus, radish, cucumber, gourd, fennel, capers, onions, saffron, parsley, marjoram, cabbage, lettuce, cumin, garlic, figs, &quot;Armenian apricots,&quot; plums, mulberries, peaches, and hemp.

==Storage==
Columella describes how produce is stored and gives advice to prevent spoilage. Liquids produced for market like oil and wine were stored on the ground floor and grain was stored in lofts with hay and other fodder. He instructs that granaries be well ventilated, cool, with minimal humidity, to prolong freshness. He describes certain methods of construction to avoid buildings developing cracks that would give animals and weevils access to the grains.

Press rooms, he advised, should be warm receiving light from the south to prevent the oil from freezing, which makes oil spoil faster.

==Land==
Columella describes land as being classified into three types of terrain which he calls champaign (sloping plains), hills with a gradual but gentle rise, and wooded, verdant mountain highlands. Of soil, he says there are six qualities: fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry. The permutations of these qualities producing many varieties of soils. Columella quotes Vergil&#x27;s comment that loose soil is &quot;what we rival when we plough&quot;. Of the most preferred types of soil he says the best is fat and loose soil that is the least costly and most productive, then fat and dense which is productive though requiring more effort, and after these are the moist soils.

==Farming practices==

In the 5th century BC, farms in Rome were small and family owned. The Greeks of this period, however, had started using crop rotation and had large estates. Rome&#x27;s contact with Carthage, Greece, and the Hellenistic East in the 3rd and 2nd centuries improved Rome&#x27;s agricultural methods. Roman agriculture reached its height in productivity and efficiency during the late Republic and early Empire.

Farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18–108 iugera. (One iugerum was equal to about 0.65 acres or a quarter of a hectare). Medium-sized farms were from 80–500 iugera. Large estates (called &quot;latifundia&quot;) were over 500 iugera.

In the late Republican era, the number of &quot;latifundia&quot; increased. Wealthy Romans bought land from peasant farmers who could no longer make a living. Starting in 200 BC, the Punic Wars called peasant farmers away to fight for longer periods of time. This is now disputed; some scholars now believe that large-scale agriculture did not dominate Italian agriculture until the 1st century BC.

Cows provided milk while oxen and mules did the heavy work on the farm. Sheep and goats were cheese producers and were prized for their hides. Horses were not widely used in farming but were raised by the rich for racing or war. Sugar production centered on beekeeping, and some Romans raised snails as luxury food.

The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm&#x27;s produce; forced labour by slaves owned by aristocrats and supervised by slave managers; and other arrangements in which a farm was leased to a tenant.

Cato the Elder (also known as &quot;Cato the Censor&quot;) was a politician and statesman in the mid- to late Roman Republic and described his view of a farm of 100 iugera in the De agri cultura. He claimed such a farm should have &quot;a foreman, a foreman&#x27;s wife, ten laborers, one ox driver, one donkey driver, one man in charge of the willow grove, one swineherd, in all sixteen persons; two oxen, two donkeys for wagon work, one donkey for the mill work.&quot; He also said that such a farm should have &quot;three presses fully equipped, storage jars in which five vintages amounting to eight hundred cullei can be stored, twenty storage jars for wine-press refuse, twenty for grain, separate coverings for the jars, six fiber-covered half amphorae, four fiber-covered amphorae, two funnels, three basketwork strainers, [and] three strainers to dip up the flower, ten jars for [handling] the wine juice...&quot; It is important to note that Cato&#x27;s description is not indicative of the majority of farms in the early 2nd century BC. De agri cultura is a political document designed to show off Cato&#x27;s character as much as it is a practical guide.

==Trade==
There was much commerce between the provinces of the empire, and all regions of the empire were largely economically interdependent. Some provinces specialized in the production of grains including wheat, emmer, spelt, barley, and millet; others in wine and others in olive oil, depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his &quot;De re rustica&quot;, &quot;Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for winter wheat and spelt. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry.&quot;

Pliny the Elder wrote extensively about agriculture in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; from books XII to XIX, including chapter XVIII, The Natural History of Grain.

Greek geographer Strabo considered the Po Valley (northern Italy) to be the most important economically because &quot;all cereals do well, but the yield from millet is exceptional, because the soil is so well watered.&quot; The province of Etruria had heavy soil good for wheat. Volcanic soil in Campania made it well-suited for wine production. In addition to knowledge of different soil categories, the Romans also took interest in what type of manure was best for the soil. The best was poultry manure, and cow manure one of the worst. Sheep and goat manure were also good. Donkey manure was best for immediate use, while horse manure wasn&#x27;t good for grain crops, but according to Marcus Terentius Varro, it was very good for meadows because &quot;it promotes a heavy growth of grass plants like grass.&quot;

==Economics==
In the grain-growing area of north Africa, centered on the ancient city of Carthage, a family of six people needed to cultivate 12 iugera/ 3 hectares of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals). If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera was needed. More land would be required to meet subsistence levels if the family farmed as sharecroppers. In Africa Proconsularis in the 2nd century AD, one-third of the total crop went to the landowner as rent (See Lex Manciana).

Such figures detail only the subsistence level. It is clear that large scale surplus production was undertaken in some provinces, such as to supply the cities, especially Rome, with grain, a process known as the Cura Annonae.
Egypt, northern Africa, and Sicily were the principal sources of grain to feed the population of Rome, estimated at one million people at its peak. 

For yields of wheat, the number varies depending on the ancient source. Varro mentions 10:1 seed-yield ratio for wheat as normal for wealthy landowners. In some areas of Etruria, yield may have been as high as 15:1. Cicero indicates &quot;In Verrem&quot; a yield of 8:1 as normal, and 10:1 in exceptionally good harvest. Paul Erdkamp mentions in his book &quot;The Grain Market in the Roman Empire&quot;, that Columella was probably biased when he mentions a much lower yield of 4:1. According to Erdkamp, Columella wanted to make the point that &quot;grain offers little profit compared to wine. His argument induces him to exaggerate the profitability of vineyards and at the same time to diminish the yields that were obtained in grain cultivation. At best Columella provides a trustworthy figure for poor soils; at worst, his estimate is not reliable at all.&quot;

Average wheat yields per year in the 3rd decade of the century, sowing 135 kg/ha of seed, were around 1,200 kg/ha in Italy and Sicily, 1,710 kg/ha in Egypt, 269 kg/ha in Cyrenaica, Tunisia at 400 kg/ha, and Algeria at 540 kg/ha, Greece at 620 kg/ha. This makes the Mediterranean very difficult to average overall.

An agricultural unit was known as a &quot;latus&quot; &quot;fundus&quot; mentioned by Varro as a great estate, which can be interpreted as a latifundia or at 500 iugera or around 125 hectares because this is the land limit imposed by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus as tribune in 133 BC.

With the incorporation of Egypt into the Roman empire and the rule of the emperor Augustus (27 BC-14 AD), Egypt became the main source of supply of grain for Rome. By the 70s AD, the historian Josephus was claiming that Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year and Egypt only four. Although that statement may ignore grain from Sicily, and overestimate the importance of Africa, there is little doubt among historians that Africa and Egypt were the most important sources of grain for Rome. To help assure that the grain supply would be adequate for Rome, in the second century BC, Gracchus settled 6,000 colonists near Carthage, giving them about each to grow grain.

Grain made into bread was, by far, the most important element in the Roman diet. Several scholars have attempted to compute the total amount of grain needed to supply the city of Rome. Rickman estimated that Rome needed 40 million &quot;modii&quot; (200,000 tonnes) of grain per year to feed its population. Erdkamp estimated that the amount needed would be at least 150,000 tonnes, calculating that each resident of the city consumed of grain per year. The total population of Rome assumed in calculating these estimates was between 750,000 and one million people. David Mattingly and Gregory Aldrete estimated the amount of imported grain at 237,000 tonnes for 1 million inhabitants; This amount of grain would provide 2,326 calories daily per person not including other foods such as meats, seafood, fruit, legumes, vegetable and dairy. In the Historia Augusta, it is stated Severus left 27 million modii in storage - considered to be a figure for the canon at the end of the 4th century and enough for 800,000 inhabitants at 500 lbs of bread per person per annum

Pliny the Younger painted a picture that Rome was able to survive without Egyptian wheat in his speech the &quot;Panegyricus&quot; in 100 AD. In 99 there was an Egyptian crisis due to inadequate flooding.

Pliny the Younger stated that for &quot;long it was generally believed that Rome could only be fed and maintained with Egyptian aid&quot;. However, he argued that &quot;Now [that] we have returned the Nile its riches... her business is not to allow us food but to pay a proper tribute.

==Mechanization==

The Romans improved crop growing by irrigating plants using aqueducts to transport water. Mechanical devices aided agriculture and the production of food. Extensive sets of mills existed in Gaul and Rome at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at Barbegal in southern France, near Arles. Sixteen overshot water wheels arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century. The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of flour per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time.

Vertical water wheels were well known to the Romans, described by Vitruvius in his &quot;De architectura&quot; of 25 BC, and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; of AD 77. There are also later references to floating water-driven grain mills in Rome and Byzantium and to water-driven sawmills on the river Moselle by the poet Ausonius. Multiple stacked sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels were used to provide motive power in many Roman mines.

There is evidence from bas-reliefs that farmers in northern Gaul (present day France) used a kind of automatic harvester or reaper when collecting ripe grain crops. The machine, called the &quot;vallus&quot; or &quot;gallic vallus&quot;, was apparently invented and used by the Treveri people. It cut the ears of grain without the straw and was pushed by oxen or horses. Pliny the Elder mentions the device in the &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; XVIII, 296. Possibly because the vallus was cumbersome and expensive, its adoption never became widespread and it fell into disuse after the 4th century AD. Scythes and sickles were the usual tools for harvesting crops.

==Acquiring a farm==

Aristocrats and common people could acquire land for a farm in one of three ways. The most common way to gain land was to purchase the land. Though some lower-class citizens did own small pieces of land, they often found it too difficult and expensive to maintain. Because of the many difficulties of owning land, they would sell it to someone in the aristocracy who had the financial backing to support a farm. Though there were some public lands available to the common person for use, aristocrats also tended to purchase those pieces of land, which caused a great deal of tension between the two classes. “Mass eviction of the poor by the rich underlay the political tensions and civil wars of the last century of the Roman Republic.” Another way to acquire land was as a reward for going to war. High-ranking soldiers returning from war would often be given small pieces of public land or land in provinces as a way of paying them for their services. The last way to obtain land was through inheritance. A father could leave his land to his family, usually to his son, in the event of his death. Wills were drawn out that specified who would receive the land as a way of ensuring that other citizens did not try to take the land from the family of the deceased.

==Problems for farmers==
Roman farmers faced many of the problems which have historically affected farmers, including the unpredictability of weather, rainfall, and pests. Farmers also had to be wary of purchasing land too far away from a city or port because of war and land conflicts. As Rome was a vast empire that conquered many lands, it created enemies with individuals whose land had been taken. They would often lose their farms to the invaders who would take over and try to run the farms themselves. Though Roman soldiers would often come to the aid of the farmers and try to regain the land, these fights often resulted in damaged or destroyed property. Landowners also faced problems with slave rebellions at times. &quot;In addition to invasions by Carthaginians and Celtic tribes, slave rebellions and civil wars which were repeatedly fought on Italian soil all contributed to the destruction of traditional agricultural holdings.

<text>Moritz von Schwind (21 January 1804 – 8 February 1871) was an Austrian painter, born in Vienna. Schwind&#x27;s genius was lyrical—he drew inspiration from chivalry, folklore, and the songs of the people. Schwind died in Pöcking in Bavaria, and was buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

==Life and career==
Moritz von Schwind received rudimentary training and spent a happy and carefree youth in Vienna. Among his companions was the composer Schubert, some of whose songs he illustrated. In 1828, the year of Schubert&#x27;s death, he moved to Munich, where he befriended the painter Schnorr and enjoyed the guidance of Cornelius, then director of the Academy.

In 1834, he was commissioned to decorate King Ludwig&#x27;s new palace with wall paintings illustrating the works of the poet Tieck. He also found in the same place congenial sport for his fancy in a &quot;Kinderfries&quot;. He was often busy working on almanacs, and on illustrating Goethe and other writers through which he gained considerable recognition and employment.

In the revival of art in Germany, Schwind held as his own the sphere of poetic fancy. In 1839 he was entrusted with the new Karlsruhe academy, itself an embodiment in fresco of ideas thrown out by Goethe. He decorated a villa in Leipzig with the story of Cupid and Psyche, and further justified his title of poet-painter with designs from the &quot;Niebelungenlied&quot; and Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme&quot; for the walls of the castle of Hohenschwangau in Bavaria.

From the year 1844 dates his residence in Frankfurt during which he created some of his finest easel pictures, most notably the &quot;Singers&#x27; Contest&quot; in the Wartburg (1846), as well as designs for the Goethe celebration. There were also numerous book illustrations. The conceptions for the most part are better than the execution.

In 1847, Schwind returned to Munich on being appointed professor in the academy. Eight years later his fame was at its height on the completion in the castle of the Wartburg of wall pictures illustrative of the &quot;Singers&#x27; Contest&quot; and of the history of Elizabeth of Hungary.

The compositions received universal praise, and at a grand musical festival in their honour, Schwind himself was one of the violinists. In Munich he also worked on some churches, particularly the altar and windows of the Church of Our Lady.

His exceptionally mature cycle, &quot;Seven Ravens&quot; from Grimm&#x27;s fairy stories was produced in 1857. In the same year he visited England to report officially to King Ludwig on the Manchester art treasures. So diversified were his gifts that he turned his hand to church windows and joined his old friend Schnorr in designs for the painted glass in Glasgow Cathedral.

Towards the close of his career, with broken health and his powers on the wane, he revisited Vienna. During this time, he created the cycle from the legend of Melusine and the designs commemorative of chief musicians which decorate the foyer of the Vienna State Opera. Cornelius writes, &quot;You have translated the joy of music into pictorial art.&quot;

<text>Rohan Jayasekera (born January 1961) is an English freelance journalist and advocate specialising in freedom of expression rights issues in conflict zones and repressive states. He was born in Holloway, North London, of mixed Sri Lankan-Scots-Irish parentage.

==Career==
Jayasekera began his journalistic career as an apprentice reporter in &quot;Borehamwood&quot;, Hertfordshire in 1980, worked for a variety of London and national newspapers during the 1980s and 1990s before going abroad, covering half a dozen conflicts thereafter including Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. He is a former managing editor of the &quot;Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting&quot; and former deputy CEO of the UK quarterly magazine &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, where he was responsible for the charity&#x27;s international programmes and fundraising. He is now a freelance digital publisher managing a series of new R&amp;D, advocacy and journalism projects on freedom of expression rights issues in conflict zones and repressive states

Between 2008 and the years running up to and during the Arab Spring, Jayasekera chaired the &quot;Tunisia Monitoring Group&quot; (IFEX-TMG), a campaigning group of 21 Arab and international free expression rights groups supporting dissidents in &quot;Tunisia&quot;.

==Background==
Jayasekera&#x27;s maternal grandfather left Ireland as a child, fought Mosleyites in Cable Street and spent the war in the Royal Navy, which exposed him to three life changing experiences: US segregation in Norfolk, Virginia; Soviet segregation in Murmansk, Siberia, and the war itself. His paternal grandfather was the first Sinhalese owner-manager of an independent plantation in pre-war Sri Lanka. His uncle was Kingsley Jayasekera, a Sri Lankan singer, actor and play producer.

==Controversies==

===Jayasekera and David Irving===

Between 2001 and 2004, Jayasekera ran an associated blog for the UK quarterly magazine &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; at www.indexonline.org. In May 2001, he provoked outrage from critics of the Holocaust denier David Irving by agreeing to share a stage with him at the Oxford Union to oppose the proposition that &quot;this house would restrict the free speech of extremists&quot;. The previous year a High Court judge had found that Mr Irving was &quot;an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism&quot;. Strong protest followed, including direct appeals to the then chair of the board, Michael Grade, and objections from some of Jayasekera&#x27;s colleagues.

At a time before Irving&#x27;s jailing in Austria, Jayasekera was criticised for breaking the so-called &quot;no platform&quot; rule. This policy – formally adopted by Britain&#x27;s National Union of Students and other groups – requires, first, that fascists should not be given public forum, and secondly that if they do gain a platform other political parties and organisations should refuse to share it with them. Jayasekera declined to comply. The debate was eventually cancelled on the advice of the police.

===John Malkovich===

There was similar protest a year later when Jayasekera went online to defend &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;&#x27;s refusal to cancel a charity performance of the John Malkovich film &quot;The Dancer Upstairs&quot; at London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). In May 2002, Malkovich had been asked who – as the star of &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; – he would like to fight a duel with. He picked Robert Fisk, &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Middle East correspondent, and disgraced constituent-hopping MP George Galloway, adding that rather than duel with them, he would &quot;rather just shoot them&quot;. Fisk reacted with outrage. Reporters sans Frontieres condemned Malkovich&#x27;s comments, but Jayasekera dismissed them as &quot;flippant&quot; in an article for the &quot;Index&quot; website. &quot;You can cry wolf once too often over unrealistic threats&quot;, Jayasekera wrote. &quot;It undermines the case for real action when real and present dangers to journalists raise their heads.&quot; He added:

:Over the years since (the Rwanda genocide), and not without criticism, &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; has turned to reporting the areas where the right to free speech conflicts with these other rights. &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; is a journalistic enterprise, not a campaigning agency. This has freed it to make judgement calls – some say to equivocate – on when and where and how and why the freely expressed word can be a direct threat to other human rights.

The fundraising event went ahead in December 2002 despite a street protest outside the ICA. Index on Censorship has since changed its strategy to include a number of successful advocacy campaigns in the UK and abroad.

===Theo van Gogh===
Jayasekera spent much of 2003 and 2004 in Iraq working on &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;&#x27;s &quot;local media rights support&quot; projects in Baghdad, but in late 2004 he was again involved in controversy after writing an online article that to many readers seemed to condone or justify the murder of the Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh. The article claimed that van Gogh was a &quot;free-speech fundamentalist&quot; who had been on a &quot;martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities&quot; in an &quot;abuse of his right to free speech&quot;. Describing van Gogh&#x27;s film &quot;Submission&quot; as &quot;furiously provocative&quot;, Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as:

&quot;A sensational climax to a lifetime&#x27;s public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo! Bravo!&quot;

There were many protests from both left- and right-wing commentators at the article. The veteran feminist commentator Germaine Greer called the item &quot;vile vomit&quot; and told the London &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; in December 2004, that:

&quot;&quot;The problem with Index on Censorship&#x27;s position is that, by its nature, they have to publish things that they don&#x27;t agree with in order to prove their own point. I would hope that by giving a fanatic a platform and listening to what he says, that people would be able to see how crazy that person is and refute his arguments. On the other hand, no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public.&quot;

Nick Cohen of &quot;The Observer&quot; claimed in December 2004 that Jayasekera:

&quot;...told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn&#x27;t have made the mistake of believing that &quot;Index on Censorship&quot; was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle — in the same way as Amnesty International is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle. It may have been so in its radical youth, but was now as concerned with fighting &#x27;hate speech&#x27; as protecting free speech.&quot;&quot;

Ursula Owen, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, and a co-founder of the feminist publishers Virago strongly repudiated Cohen&#x27;s account in a letter to the Observer. She later apologised for Jayasekera&#x27;s original comment article, saying she didn&#x27;t think &quot;the tone (was) right&quot;.

<doc id="1274187" wikidata="Q1640601" url="?curid=1274187" title="Islam in Bulgaria">
<text>Islam in Bulgaria is a minority religion and the second largest religion in the country after Christianity. According to the 2021 Census, the total number of Muslims in Bulgaria stood at 638,708 corresponding to 9.8% of the population. Ethnically, Muslims in Bulgaria are Turks, Bulgarians and Roma, living mainly in parts of northeastern Bulgaria (mainly in Razgrad, Targovishte, Shumen and Silistra Provinces) and in the Rhodope Mountains (mainly in Kardzhali Province and Smolyan Province).

==History==
===Contact with Islam prior to the Ottoman conquest===
The first documented Bulgarian contact with the Muslim world was in the early 700s, when Khan Tervel of Bulgaria helped the Byzantines break the Arab siege of Constantinople, after his army reportedly slaid some 22,000 enemy soldiers Two centuries afterwards, enmity turned into mutual collaboration, as Bulgaria under Tsar Simeon I and the Arabs coordinated their attacks on the Byzantine Empire multiple times. During the same period, Bulgarian art started exhibiting some Islamic influence, probably mediated by the Byzantines.

Later on, in the mid 1200s, a group of Seljuk Turks is thought to have settled in North Dobruja. According to Ibn Battuta and Evliya Çelebi, the Turkomans colonised the Black Sea coast between the Bulgarian border and Babadag further north. Eventually, part of them returned to Anatolia, while the rest adopted Christianity and are thought to be probable ancestors of the modern Gagauz. However, there is debate whether this settlement ever really happened, as some scholars believe it to have the characteristics of a folk legend.

Scholarly consensus holds that the first Muslim communities in Southeastern Europe, including Bulgaria, appeared in the late fourteenth century, as the peninsula gradually fell under Ottoman rule.

===Ottoman rule (1396–1878)===
The Ottoman Empire conquered the last independent piece of the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Tsardom of Vidin, in 1396 (or, as some historians hypothesise, in 1422), and Bulgaria remained under Ottoman and Islamic rule for almost five centuries. Christians in the Ottoman Empire were treated as second-class citizens, i.e., as dhimmis. They were often called giaour, meaning &quot;infidel&quot; as an offensive term. Most of the conquered land was parcelled out to the Sultan&#x27;s followers, who held it as benefices or fiefs (small ones timar, medium ones zeamet and large ones hass). The system was meant to make the army self-sufficient and to continuously increase the number of Ottoman cavalry soldiers, thus both fueling new conquests and bringing conquered countries under direct Ottoman control.

Christians paid disproportionately higher taxes than Muslims, including the poll tax, jizye, in lieu of military service. According to İnalcık, jizye was the single most important source of income (48 per cent) to the Ottoman budget, with Rumelia accounting for the lion&#x27;s share, or 81 per cent of the revenues. However, by the early 1600, almost all land had been divided into estates (arpalik) granted to senior Ottoman dignitaries as a form of tax farming, which created conditions for severe exploitation of taxpayers by unscrupulous land holders. According to Radishev, overtaxation became a particularly poignant issue after jizye collection in most of the country was taken over by the Six Divisions of Cavalry.

Bulgarians also paid a number of other taxes, including a tithe (&quot;yushur&quot;), a land tax (&quot;ispench&quot;), a levy on commerce, and various irregularly collected taxes, products and corvees (&quot;avariz&quot;). As a rule, the overall tax burden of the rayah (i.e., Non-Muslims), was twice as high as that of Muslims.

Christians faced a number of other restrictions: they were barred from testifying against Muslims in inter-faith legal disputes. Even though they were free to perform their own religious rituals, this had to be done in a manner that was inconscpicuous to Muslims, i.e., loud prayers or bell ringing were forbidden. They were not permitted to build or repair churches without Muslim consent. They were barred from certain professions, from riding horses, from wearing certain colours or from carrying weapons. Their houses and churches could not be taller than Muslim ones.
Nevertheless, there were specific categories of rayah who were exempt from nearly all such restrictions, such as the Dervendjis, who guarded important passes, roads, bridges, etc., ore-mining centres such as Chiprovtsi, etc. Some of the most important Bulgarian culutural and economic centres in the 19th century owe their development to a former dervendji status, for example, Gabrovo, Dryanovo, Kalofer, Panagyurishte, Kotel, Zheravna. Similarly, Christians living on wakf holdings were subject to lower tax burden and fewer restrictions.

Probably the worst practice Christian Bulgarians were subjected to was the &quot;devşirme&quot;, or blood tax, where the healthiest and brightest Christian boys were taken from their families, enslaved, converted to Islam and later employed either in the Janissary military corps or the Ottoman administrative system. The boys were picked from one in forty households. They had to be unmarried and, once taken, were ordered to cut all ties with their family. Christian parents resented the forced recruitment of their children, and would beg and seek to buy their children out of the levy. Sources mention different ways to avoid the devshirme such as: marrying the boys at the age of 12, mutilating them or having both father and son convert to Islam. In 1565, the practice led to a revolt in Albania and Epirus, where the inhabitants killed the recruiting officials.

===Colonisation and conversion to Islam===
Islam in Bulgaria spread through both colonisation with Muslims from Asia Minor and conversion of native Bulgarians. The Ottomans&#x27; mass population transfers began in the late 1300s and continued well into the 1500s. Most of these, but far from all, were invountary. The first community settled in present-day Bulgaria was made up of Tatars who willingly arrived to begin a settled life as farmers, the second one a tribe of nomads that had run afoul of the Ottoman administration. Both groups settled in the Upper Thracian Plain, in the vicinity of Plovdiv. Another large group of Tatars was moved by Mehmed I to Thrace in 1418, followed by the relocation of more than 1000 Turkoman families to Northeastern Bulgaria in the 1490s. At the same time, there are records of at least two forced relocations of Bulgarians to Anatolia, one right after the fall of Veliko Tarnovo and a second one to İzmir in the mid-1400s. The goal of this &quot;mixing of peoples&quot; was to quell any unrest in the conquered Balkan states, while simultaneously getting rid of troublemakers in the Ottoman backyard in Anatolia.

Nevertheless, the Ottomans never pursued or practiced forced Islamisation of the Bulgarian population, as had earlier been claimed by Communist Bulgarian historiography. According to scholarly consensus, conversion to Islam was voluntary as it offered Bulgarians religious and economic benefits. Missionary activities of the &quot;dervish&quot; orders resulted in mass conversions to Islam; though many converts retained Christian practices such as baptism, celebration of Christian holidays etc. Muslim population in Bulgaria was a combination of indigenous converts to Islam, and Muslims originating outside the Balkans. Most urban areas gradually became Muslim majority, whereas rural areas remained overwhelmingly Christian. However, in some cases, adopting Islam can be said to be the result of tax coercion. While some authors have argued that other factors, such as desire to retain social status, were of greater importance, Turkish writer Halil İnalcık has referred to the desire to stop paying jizya as a primary incentive for conversion to Islam in the Balkans, and Bulgarian Anton Minkov has argued that it was one among several motivating factors.

Two large-scale studies of the causes of adoption of Islam in Bulgaria, one of the Chepino Valley by Dutch Ottomanist Machiel Kiel, and another one of the region of Gotse Delchev in the Western Rhodopes by Evgeni Radushev reveal a complex set of factors behind the process. These include: pre-existing high population density owing to the late inclusion of the two mountainous regions in the Ottoman system of taxation; immigration of Christian Bulgarians from lowland regions to avoid taxation throughout the 1400s; the relative poverty of the regions; early introduction of local Christian Bulgarians to Islam through contacts with nomadic Yörüks; the nearly constant Ottoman conflict with the Habsburgs from the mid-1500s to the early 1700s; the resulting massive war expenses that led to a sixfold increase in the jizya rate from 1574 to 1691 and the imposition of a war-time avariz tax; the Little Ice Age in the 1600s that caused crop failures and widespread famine; heavy corruption and overtaxation by local landholders—all of which led to a slow, but steady process of Islamisation until the mid-1600s when the tax burden becomes so unbearable that most of the remaining Christians either converted en masse or left for lowland areas.

As a result of these factors, the population of Ottoman Bulgaria is presumed to have dropped twofold from a peak of approx. 1.8 million (1.2 million Christians and 0.6 million Muslims) in the 1580s to approx. 0.9 million in the 1680s (450,000 Christians and 450,000 Muslims) after growing steadily from a base of approx. 600,000 (450,000 Christians and 150,000 Muslims) in the 1450s.

The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s greatest advantage compared to other colonial powers, the millet system and the autonomy each denomination had within legal, confessional, cultural and family matters, nevertheless, largely did not apply to Bulgarians and most other Orthodox peoples on the Balkans, as the independent Bulgarian Patriarchate was abolished, and all Bulgarian Orthodox dioceses were subjected to the rule of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople. Thus, instead of helping Christian Bulgarians maintain their customs and cultural identity, the millet system actually promoted their annihilation. Bulgarian ceased to be a literary language, the higher clergy was invariable Greek, and the Phanariotes started making persistent efforts to hellenise Bulgarians as early as the early 1700s. It was only after the struggle for church autonomy in the mid-1800s and especially after the Bulgarian Exarchate was established by a firman of Sultan Abdülaziz in 1870 that this mistake was corrected.

===Post-Independence (1878)===
Following the Russo-Turkish War and the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, five sanjaks of the Ottoman Danube Vilayet—Vidin, Veliko Tarnovo, Ruse, Sofia and Varna—were united into the autonomous Principality of Bulgaria, putting Bulgaria again on the political map of Europe after five centuries. According to the 1875 Ottoman salname, the pre-war Muslim populations of the Principality stood at 405,450 males, or a total of 810,910 people, and accounted for 39.2% of the Principality&#x27;s population. Most of the Muslims were so-called &quot;Established Muslims&quot;, i.e., Turks and Pomaks, but there were also substantial minorities of Circassian and Crimean Tatar Muhacir and Romani.

As a rule, Bulgarian governments after 1878 worked to ensure the freedom of conscience and worship of all non-Bulgarian and non-Christian citizens Thus, Muslims retained the right to administer their schools and houses of worship and kept considerable autonomy in intraconfessional matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. Muslims fought in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885 (and all of Bulgaria&#x27;s subsequent wars except for the Balkan wars and earned widespread respect as well as a high number of medals for bravery in action). Even though there were no ethnic Turkish or Muslim parties, every single national assembly until Bulgaria&#x27;s occupation by the Soviet Union in 1944 had Turkish and Muslim MPs. Mosques and imams were funded by the state budget.

The Principality expanded somewhat after the Balkan Wars when the largely-Muslim Rhodopes and Western Thrace regions were incorporated into the country. The First Balkan War was accompanied by forced Christianization of Muslim Bulgarians settlements. The atrocious act was repealed immediately by the new government elected after the loss of the Second Balkan War.

Like the practitioners of other beliefs including Orthodox Christians, Muslims suffered under the restriction of religious freedom by the Marxist-Leninist Zhivkov regime which instituted state atheism and suppressed religious communities. The Bulgarian communist regimes declared Islam and other religions to be &quot;opium of the people.&quot; In 1989, 310,000 to 360,000 people fled to Turkey as a result of the communist Zhivkov regime&#x27;s assimilation campaign; however, 154,937 of them returned in the months after the fall of Zhivkov&#x27;s regime in November 1989. The program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt Bulgarian names and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign was unclear; however, many experts believed that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor. The event became known as &quot;the revival process&quot; or &quot;the renaming.&quot; According to Bulgarian historian and human rights activist Antonina Zhelyazkova, additional 30,000 to 60,000 Muslims emigrated to Turkey between 1990 and 1996 because of the prolonged economic crisis in Bulgaria.
Muslims in Bulgaria have enjoyed greater religious freedom after the fall of the Zhivkov regime. New mosques have been built in many cities and villages; one village built a new church and a new mosque side by side. Some villages organized Quran study courses for young people (study of the Quran had been completely forbidden under Zhivkov). Muslims also began publishing their own newspaper, &quot;Miusiulmani&quot;, in both Bulgarian and Turkish. In 2022, sculptor Vezhdi Rashidov was elected Speaker of the 48th National Assembly, the highest official position ever held by a Muslim in Bulgaria.

According to the 2011 census, there were 638,708 Muslims in Bulgaria, who accounted for 9.8% of the population of the country. According to 2014 estimates, almost one million Muslims live in Bulgaria, forming the largest Muslim minority in any EU country (percentage-wise, not in absolute numbers). According to a 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center, 15% of Bulgaria&#x27;s population is Muslim. Almost all Muslims in Bulgaria are Bulgarian citizens.

=== Geographical distribution ===

According to the 2021 census, 40 out of a total of 266 Bulgarian municipalities had a Muslim majority and three additional municipalities had a Muslim plurality, or one more than in 2011. There were two municipalities with a Muslim population over 90 percent: the Sarnitsa Municipality with a Muslim population of 96.4% and the Chernoochene Municipality with a Muslim population of 90.8%. Practically all municipalities with a Muslim majority are small and very small and generally rural. The exception, and the only provincial capital municipality with a Muslim majority, is the Kardzhali Municipality. All municipalities with a Muslim majority or plurality are listed below.
===Demographic indicators===
Muslims in Bulgaria have slightly better demographic indicators compared to the Orthodox Christians in Bulgaria. The reason for this difference is mostly because of ethnicity: most Muslims in Bulgaria are Turks and Roma (and to a much lesser extent ethnic Bulgarians) and those ethnic groups live mainly in rural areas; they have different reproductive traditions and they have a younger age structure compared to the ethnic Bulgarians which leads to higher fertility and birth rates. In provinces with large Muslim concentrations, birth rates are a little bit higher while death rates are lower than the country average. For example: Bulgaria had a total birth rate of 10.5‰ in 1992 while Muslims formed about 13 percent of the total population. However, in provinces with large Muslim populations the birth rate ranged from in 11.0‰ in Smolyan and 11.6‰ in Silistra to 13.1‰ in Razgrad (&gt;50 percent Muslim) and 14.7‰ in Kardzhali (about 70 percent Muslim).

===Age structure===

Muslims constituted about 10 percent of all respondents in the 2011 census, but they formed around 12 percent of all respondents aged under thirty and less than 7 percent of all respondents aged seventy or more.

=== Ethnicity ===

According to the 2021 census, Muslims in Bulgaria are divided into the following ethnicities: Turks with 447,893 respondents, or 88.1% of all ethnic Turks, ethnic Bulgarians with 107,777 respondents, or 2.1% of all ethnic Bulgarians and ethnic Romani with 45,817 respondents, or 17.2 of all ethnic Romani.

Bulgarian Turks live in the provinces of Kardzhali, Razgrad, Targovishte, Shumen, Silistra, Dobrich, Ruse and Burgas. They are most primarily a rural population. Muslim Bulgarians primarily live in the Rhodopes, in particular, the Smolyan Province, the municipalities of Satovcha, Yakoruda, Belitsa, Garmen, Gotse Delchev in the Blagoevgrad Province, the municipality of Velingrad in the Pazardzhik Province, and the municipalities of Ardino, Kirkovo and Krumovgrad in the Kardzhali Province, where however the majority of the population is made up of ethnic Turks. Muslim Romani live in the Shumen Province, Sliven Province, Dobrich Province, Targovishte Province, Pazardzhik Province and Plovdiv Province.

Tatar Muslims live in northeastern Bulgaria and the small Arab diaspora is based mainly in the capital, Sofia.

According to a December 2011 New Bulgarian University survey of Muslims in Bulgaria, roughly 64% identified as Turks, 10.1% identified as Pomaks, and 7.0% identified as Roma.

==Branches==

According to the 2011 Bulgarian census 94.6% of Muslims in Bulgaria were Sunni Muslim, 4.75% were Shia, and 0.65% were Muslims without further specifications. There is also a small Ahmadiyya presence in Bulgaria, but they are not counted on the census.

==Religiosity==

Evgenia Ivanova of the New Bulgarian University stated in 2011 that &quot;religion is not of primary importance to Bulgaria&#x27;s Muslims.&quot; The New Bulgarian University conducted a survey of 1.850 Muslims in Bulgaria, which found that 48.6% described themselves as religious, 28.5% of which were very religious. Approximately 41% never went to a mosque and 59.3% did not pray at home. Only 0.5% believed that disputes should be resolved using Islamic Sharia law and 79.6% said that wearing a veil in school was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; 50,4% of the respondents said cohabitation without marriage was &quot;acceptable&quot; (41,9% said &quot;nonacceptable&quot; and 7,6% refused to answer), 39.8% ate pork and 43.3% drank alcohol. On the contrary, 88% of respondents said they circumcised their boys and 96% observed Muslim burial practices for their relatives.

According to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey, 33% of Bulgarian Muslims responded that religion is &quot;very important&quot; in their lives. The same survey found that 7% of Bulgarian Muslims pray all five salah, 22% attend mosque at least once a week, and 6% read Quran at least once a week.

==Culture==
During the socialist period of Bulgaria&#x27;s history, most Muslims did not have access to halal food. In contemporary Bulgaria, the notion of halal food is only slowly re-appearing and only a few Muslims adhere to dietary restrictions. The majority of Muslims in Bulgaria who adhere to halal food restrictions are recent Arab immigrants to the country. In supermarkets, there are no signs indicating whether food is halal.

Few Bulgarian Muslim women wear traditional Islamic dress of any kind, such as headscarves, and most who do live in the rural parts of the country.

On 20 February 2013, the regional muftiate in Shumen organized a Sufi music concert, announced to be the first of its kind, because of the participation of a unique male choir consisting of 22 Sufi singers trained in Todor Ikonomovo village. The event was honoured by the Chief Mufti, the Head of the Supreme Muslim Council Shabanali Ahmed, diplomats from the Turkish Embassy in Sofia and other distinguished guests.

In 2013, the council of Ministers granted a day&#x27;s holiday for Mawlid, two days for Eid al-Fitr, and three for Eid al-Adha. During Eid al-Adha, 2,500 packages of meat were distributed to people in need by the Chief Muftiate. The same year, the Chief Muftiate organized campaigns to help provide food and shelter to Syrian refugees.

In October 2014, the Muftiate launched a campaign during Eid al-Adha to donate packages of meat 30,000 families of any religion.

During Ashura, the Muftiate and representatives of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church distributed thousands of portions of Ashure for the poor.

===Interfaith relations===
Since 1989, the Muftiate has made effort to expand interreligious relations between Muslims and religious groups in Bulgaria. In 2013, Muslims helped in the repair of a church in Dyranovets. Teachers and pupils from Muslim religious schools meet with their Christian counterparts.

According to Bulgarian scholar and writer Aziz Nazmi Shakir, the relations between the local Muslim and Jewish communities are &quot;rather positive.&quot; In August 2013, during Limmud week, the Bulgarian Jewish community organized in Bansko a scientific discussion dedicated to &quot;The Personality of Moses in the Discourses of the Monotheistic Religions&quot; attended by the Deputy Chief Mufti Miimiin Birali, Rabbi Aaron Zerbib, Pastor Evgeniy Naydenov and Father Petko Valov, the representative of the Catholic Apostolic Exarchate.

In 2013, during Ramadan, United States Ambassador Marcie Ries organized an iftar to which the Chief Mufti Mustafa Alish, the head of the Central Israelite Spiritual Council Robert Jerassy and the president of the United Evangelical Churches Nikolay Nedelev were invited. On 23 May and 8 June 2013, Christian and Muslim women held a charity bazaar (selling prayer beads, clothing, accessories, paintings, etc.) in the square behind Banya Bashi Mosque aimed at providing financial support for the Centre for Medical Care and &quot;St. Ivan Rilski&quot; Nursery in Sofia. In recent years, the Students&#x27; Council at the Higher Islamic Institute and the Chief Muftiate, in cooperation with Central Israelite Spiritual Council, the Theological Faculty at Sofia University &quot;St Kliment Ohridski&quot;, the organisation of the Jews in Bulgaria &quot;Shalom&quot; and &quot;Ethnopalitra&quot; Foundation have organized interreligious discussions and public lectures dedicated to the philosophical, historical and political relations between the monotheistic religions, hosted by the Media Cultural Centre of the Chief Muftiate. The Chief Mufti met with the Neophyte of Bulgaria and Anselmo Guido Pecorari in 2014.

==Education and income==

During the transition to capitalism after the 1990 fall of socialist government, Muslim communities suffered disproportionately. Numerous Muslim enterprises were shut down and the low economic status of Muslims was exacerbated by the lack of education and poor infrastructure in the rural parts of the country. A 2001 study by sociologists under the leadership of Ivan Szelenyi from Yale University concluded that poverty and severe economic crisis affected Muslims and Roma in Bulgaria the most. Sociologists have since used the term &quot;ethnicization&quot; to describe the widening of the economic status gap negatively affecting several minority communities in Bulgaria. Research also shows that educational problems faced by minorities creates social stratification and magnifies negative stereotypes.

==Religious infrastructure==

Muslims are represented in the public arena by the Chief Muftiate. In 2013, the Provisional Prime Minister Marin Raykov visited the Muftiate. During his visit, Raykov stated that Muslims were an integral part of the nation and promised &quot;the wounds of the past will not be exploited.&quot; Officially, the Bulgarian Muslim community is called the &quot;Мюсюлманско изповедание&quot; (Muslim Denomination). Administration is controlled by the &quot;Висш духовен съвет&quot; (Supreme Muslim Council), which has 30 members. The core institution, of the Supreme Muslim Council is the &quot;Главно мюфтийство&quot; (Chief Muftiate), which has 20 departments including Hajj, education, and public relations. There are also 21 regional muftiates. The current Chief Mufti of Bulgaria is Mustafa Hadzhi, who was reelected in 2016.

Ekrem Hakki Ayverdi documented 2,356 mosques in Bulgaria during the 1980s. Currently, the number of mosques in Bulgaria is estimated to be around 1,260. Around 400 of these mosques were constructed after the fall of the communist government, and more than 100 are not currently in use. During the communist era, the estate property acts of most mosques were purged from the archives. The largest mosque in Bulgaria is the Tumbul Mosque in Shumen, built during the 18th century.

The Scientific Research Centre (SRC) at the Higher Islamic Institute was established in 2014. The SRC aims to promote constructive and critical study of Islam and Muslims, especially in Europe. Particular areas of research include classical and modern exegesis methods, ecology and Islam, and Islamic art.

==Controversies==
===Islamic dress===
On 30 September 2016, the Parliament of Bulgaria, backed by the Patriotic Front passed the law that outlaws wearing burqas by women in public places in an effort to combat terrorism and migrants flowing through Europe. However, non-Bulgarian citizens are free to wear the burqa.

===Islamism===
In 2012, 13 Salafi imams were put on trial in the Pazardzhik District Court for &quot;preaching anti-democratic ideology&quot; and &quot;opposition to the principles of democracy, separation of powers, liberalism, a rule-of-law state, basic human rights such as gender equality and religious freedom.&quot; In March 2014, one of the imams named Ahmed Musa Ahmed, was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison. Two other imams were given suspended prison sentences and the other ten were fined. In 2015, the case was brought to an appellate court.

In November 2014, several homes were raided in the Roma village of Izgrev of the Pazardzhik Province in southern Bulgaria. Among the 26 people who were arrested for 24 hours was Ahmed Musa Ahmed and six other preachers who were charged with support ISIS. Deputy Chief Prosecutor Borislav Sarafov stated that the preachers were propagating anti-democratic ideology and &quot;non-native... &#x27;Arab&#x27; forms of Islam&quot; opposed to the &quot;Turkish Islam&quot; that has existed in Bulgaria for centuries.

Multiple studies, including work by IMIR, have concluded that Salafi and Islamist ideology disproportionately affect the Roma Muslim community due to the community&#x27;s low economic and educational standing compared to mainstream Bulgarian society.

====Opposition====
In October 2014, the Chief Muftiate published a declaration condemning ISIS and appealing to Bulgarian Muslims not to respond to calls for jihad and the establishment of a caliphate.

==Discrimination==
Muslims in Bulgaria are obliged to register periodic conferences at the Sofia City Court, which members of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church are not required to do.

The Attack Party, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, and other far-right factions have used refugees to ignite xenophobia, and at least three racially motivated attacks were reported in 2013. After an Attack MP warned the country that Syrian refugees were &quot;cannibals&quot; and that their presence was designed to disguise an &quot;Islamic wave&quot; supported by American and Turkish interests, a group of Syrian refugees filed a complaint before the State Commission for Discrimination. In November 2013, a new nationalistic party was founded promising to &quot;cleanse the country of foreign immigrant scum.&quot; Ultranationalist factions have formed &quot;citizen patrols&quot; to check whether migrants &quot;comply with the law of the state&quot;. Some of these claimed to have official authorization from the authorities.

In February 2014, 19 MP&#x27;s of the Attack Party and the Religious Denominations and Parliamentary Ethics Committee prepared a bill amending the &quot;Laws on Religions&quot; that would stop lawsuits for regaining &quot;waqf&quot; properties claimed by the Muftiate. In February 2014, more than 1,000 people from across Bulgaria protested against the decision of the Plovdiv Court to return the Kurshun Mosque in Karlovo, which had been nationalized during the communist era. The same month, protesters threw stones and smoke bombs at the Jumaya Mosque in Plovdiv. They waved signs holding &quot;Stop the Islamization of Bulgaria.&quot; Similar protests were supported by the National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria.

However, local journalists and political analysts have long described Attack and the Turkish minority party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), as &quot;communicating vessels&quot;, noting that both of them engage in outrageous acts just before elections to mobilise their voters and that the apparent hostility between them is only performative. Former DPS activists have accused DPS of financing Attack and have alleged that both of them are products of the intelligence service of the Communist regime.

In July 2014, for the first time in Bulgaria&#x27;s democratic history, the President of Bulgaria Rosen Plevneliev hosted an iftar dinner. The iftar took place in the President&#x27;s Boyana Residence and was attended by the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the National Assembly, party leaders, and representatives of all religions in the country.

<text>John Henry Rostill (16 June 1942 – 26 November 1973) was an English musician, bassist and composer, recruited by the Shadows to replace Brian Locking in autumn 1963. 

He wrote many of the tunes by the Shadows including &quot;The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt&quot; in 1964. He wrote or co-wrote three songs in the 1970s which were massive hits in the United States—&quot;Let Me Be There&quot;, &quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know&quot; and &quot;Please Mr. Please&quot;—but died before seeing them succeed.

==Biography==
Born in Kings Norton, Birmingham, England, Rostill attended Rutlish School in south London (1953–59). He worked with several artists before joining the Shadows, including Bournemouth band the Interns (nowadays sometimes confused with Welsh band the Interns, who were based in London at this time signed with Tito Burns Agency; in fact, they were two different bands), the Flintstones and a stint as part of Zoot Money&#x27;s early backing band. He also played in the bands recruited to back such visiting artists as the Everly Brothers and Tommy Roe.

Stylistically, Rostill combined the solidity of Brian Locking and the adventurousness of Jet Harris. Many of his bass lines were heavily syncopated and he developed a range of new sounds on the Burns bass during his time with the group, a longer period than Harris and Locking put together. To many players, Rostill was ahead of his time and included double-stopping in his technique. Unusually for that time, Rostill sometimes played bass finger-style as well as with a plectrum, depending on the sound he wanted.

After the Shadows&#x27; break-up at the end of the 1960s, Rostill toured with Tom Jones.

Rostill was a prolific songwriter, contributing to the Shadows&#x27; output from the start (both as a solo composer and as part of the mid-sixties &quot;Marvin/Welch/Bennett/Rostill&quot; team). This combination composed the hits &quot;The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt&quot; (a UK no. 5, 1964) and “Genie with the Light Brown Lamp&quot; (UK no. 17, 1965) as well as all the tunes on the 1964 Rhythm &amp; Greens EP.

They also wrote the Cliff Richard and the Shadows hits, &quot;I Could Easily Fall (In Love with You)&quot; (UK no. 6, 1964), &quot;Time Drags By&quot; (UK no. 10, 1966) and &quot;In the Country&quot; (UK no. 6, 1967).

He later went on to write for artists such as Olivia Newton-John (&quot;Let Me Be There&quot; (Aus no. 11, US no. 6, 1973), &quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know&quot; (Aus no. 2, US no. 5, 1974) and &quot;Please Mr. Please&quot; (Aus no. 35, US no. 3, 1975), the last co-written with Bruce Welch). &quot;If You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be There&quot; were also recorded in concert by Elvis Presley after Rostill&#x27;s death.

As a Shadow, Rostill played a prototype Burns &quot;Shadows&quot; bass guitar which differed from the production model that followed. A replica of his bass was produced by Burns London in late 2006. His personal favourite instrument was a Fender Jazz bass, which he played in both the Terry Young Band and in Bournemouth band, the Interns. He also used it with the Shadows towards the end when the Burns instrument began to wear out.

John Rostill died in Radlett, Hertfordshire, England, on 26 November 1973 aged 31. He was found dead from barbiturate poisoning in his recording studio by his wife and Bruce Welch. The coroner recorded a verdict of &quot;suicide while in a depressed state of mind&quot;.

He left behind his wife Margaret and his son Paul, who was a year old when his father died.

<text>Micheline Lanctôt (born May 12, 1947) is a Canadian actress, film director, screenwriter, and musician.

==Biography==
Lanctôt was born in Frelighsburg, Quebec. Her post-secondary education was in music, fine arts, and theatre at &quot;Collège Jésus-Marie&quot; in Outremont, and in art history at the Université de Montréal and the École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal; she later studied film animation at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and then at Gerald Potterton&#x27;s studios, Potterton Productions, where she remained for four years.

Lanctôt began her acting career in 1972, winning a Canadian Film Award for Best Actress for her starring role in Gilles Carle&#x27;s &quot;The True Nature of Bernadette (La vraie nature de Bernadette)&quot;. Since then, she has appeared in a wide variety of film and television roles, such as Carle&#x27;s &quot;The Heavenly Bodies (Les Corps Célestes)&quot;, Ted Kotcheff&#x27;s award-winning &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Blood Relatives&quot; and Guy Fournier&#x27;s Radio-Canada TV series &quot;Jamais deux sans toi&quot;.

She has directed for the theatre also, directing &quot;Oleanna&quot; by David Mamet for the Théâtre de Quat&#x27;Sous in Montreal in 1994, and in 1999, &quot;Bousille et les justes&quot; by Gratien Gélinas for the Théâtre du Rideau Vert.

She began her live-action film-directing career with &quot;The Handyman (L&#x27;Homme à tout faire)&quot; (1980), nominated for best direction and for best film at the Genie Awards in 1981. This success was followed by &quot;Sonatine&quot; (1984), which launched the career of Pascale Bussières and won both the Genie Award for Best Director at the 6th Genie Awards in 1985, and the now-defunct Silver Lion for Best First Film (1983-1987) at the 41st Venice International Film Festival.

Since 1982, Lanctôt has been a part-time instructor in the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema at Concordia University.

Lanctôt defended Gaétan Soucy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches (La petite fille qui aimait trop les allumettes)&quot; in the 2004 edition of &quot;Le Combat des livres&quot;, broadcast on Première Chaîne.

In 2016 she was the curator of the Festival Vues dans la tête de... film festival in Rivière-du-Loup. She is also a matron of the Prix collégial du cinéma québécois, an annual program engaging film studies students in Quebec CEGEPs to present an award for the year&#x27;s best Quebec film.

==Awards and recognition==
*Winner of an Etrog (now known as Genie), best performance by a lead actress (1972)
*Winner of the Genie, best achievement in direction, for &quot;Sonatine&quot; (1984)
*Winner of the Silver Lion, Venice Film Festival for best first work, &quot;Sonatine&quot; (1984)

<text>Alpha Pegasi (α Pegasi, abbreviated Alpha Peg, α Peg), formally named Markab , is the third-brightest star in the constellation of Pegasus and one of the four stars in the asterism known as the Great Square of Pegasus.

==Properties==
Alpha Pegasi has a stellar classification of A0 IV, indicating that it is an A-type subgiant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has evolved beyond the main sequence. Its spectrum has also been classified as B9V and B9.5III.

It is rotating rapidly, with a projected rotational velocity of 130 km/s giving a lower bound on the azimuthal velocity along the star&#x27;s equator. The effective temperature of the photosphere is about 10,000 K and the star has expanded to nearly five times the radius of the Sun, emitting 165 times as much energy as the sun.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;α Pegasi&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Pegasi&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. It bore the traditional name &quot;Markab&quot; (or &quot;Marchab&quot;), which derived from an Arabic word &quot;مركب&quot; &quot;markab&quot; &quot;the saddle of the horse&quot;, or is mistranscription of &quot;Mankib&quot;, which itself comes from an Arabic phrase &quot;منكب الفرس&quot; &quot;Mankib al-Faras&quot; &quot;(the Star of) the Shoulder (of the Constellation) of the Horse&quot; for Beta Pegasi.

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Markab&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Encampment&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting α Pegasi and β Pegasi. Consequently, the Chinese name for α Pegasi itself is (), &quot;the First Star of Encampment&quot;.

<doc id="1274204" wikidata="Q820248" url="?curid=1274204" title="Gun pod">
<text>A gun pod is a detachable pod or pack containing machine guns, autocannons, revolver cannons, or rotary cannons and ancillaries, mounted externally on a vehicle such as a military aircraft which may or may not also have its own guns.

== History ==
In World War II the Third Reich&#x27;s Luftwaffe made use of many different, and most often rigidly mounted, conformal and suspended-mount gun pod systems usually called &quot;Waffenbehälter&quot; (prefix of &quot;WB&quot;, literally &#x27;weapon container&#x27;) or &quot;Waffenträger&quot; (prefix of &quot;WT&quot;, literally &#x27;weapon carrier&#x27;), and carrying anything from rifle caliber MG 81 machine guns, all the way up to the enormous &quot;Bordkanone&quot; anti-tank cannon based ordnance weapon series, ranging from 37 to 75mm in caliber, though the usual underwing conformal gun pods fitted to Bf 109 and Fw 190 single engined fighters used either the MG 151/20 or MK 108 in gun pod mounts.

Other countries also used gun pods on their aircraft; the U.S. SBD Dauntless could be equipped with two gun pods on each wing, each with two M2 Browning machine guns.

The Bristol Blenheim Mk.1F of the Royal Air Force was a night fighter conversion of the twin engine light bomber equipped with airborne interception radar and armed with four  Browning machine gun in a special gun pack under the fuselage. The Mk.IVF was a long range fighter version armed with the same gun pack.

The RAF Hawker Hurricane Mk.IID of 1942 was an early and extremely successful example of tank busting aircraft of the North African campaign armed with two Vickers S gun with 15 rounds mounted in gondola-style pods, one under each wing.

Lessons learned during the Vietnam War showed the effectiveness of guns. Then expensive fighter jets such as the F-4 didn&#x27;t even carry an internal cannon. Missiles (thought to be superior) -- in particular radar-guided missiles—had notoriously poor combat track records in air-to-air combat. Engineers and air crews quickly created a solution by attaching rotary cannons in a cut-out fuel drop tank, creating an impromptu gun pod suitable for attacking ground targets.

Since the Vietnam War, United States Air Force policy has been that the use of multimillion-dollar aircraft for strafing is not economically justified, but the Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, have remained proponents of strafing, and have continued to develop systems for this purpose.

Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980s led to an unusual innovation in the form of the SPPU series of gun pods, which have traversable barrels allowing them to continue to fire on a fixed target as the aircraft passes overhead.

== Design ==

A gun pod typically contains one or more guns, a supply of ammunition, and, if necessary, a power source. Electrically powered cannon, such as the M61 Vulcan, may be powered from the aircraft&#x27;s electrical system or by a ram-air turbine.

Gun pods increase a vehicle&#x27;s firepower without occupying internal volume. When not required for a specific mission they can be omitted to save weight. On some vehicles they isolate delicate internal components such as radar from the weapon&#x27;s recoil and gases, and for jet aircraft allow the weapons to be mounted away from the intakes of the engines, reducing problems of gun-gas ingestion, which may cause the engine to stall.

When designed to be suspension-mounted on a hardpoint on a typical post-WW II aircraft, gun pods are inherently less accurate than integral guns, or the type of &quot;conformal&quot; gun pods that are faired smoothly into or onto the nearby surfaces of an aircraft, because the &quot;hardpoint&quot; mounting is necessarily less rigid, so that the weapon&#x27;s recoil produces more deflection. This problem is particularly acute with more powerful cannons like the 30mm GPU-5 gun pod. Both hardpoint-mounted and conformal-mount gun pods also cause substantial drag on fast-moving vehicles such as fighter aircraft.

Gun pods are commonly carried on military helicopters, and are often fitted to light aircraft to equip them for counter-insurgency operations. Some air arms use gun pods for fighter bombers for use in strafing attacks.

== Examples ==
; United States:
* GPU-2/A: Gun pod with M197 cannon.
* GPU-5/A: Gun pod with GAU-13/A cannon.

<text>Cold hardening is the physiological and biochemical process by which an organism prepares for cold weather.

==Plants==
Plants in temperate and polar regions adapt to winter and sub zero temperatures by relocating nutrients from leaves and shoots to storage organs. Freezing temperatures induce dehydrative stress on plants, as water absorption in the root and water transport in the plant decreases. Water in and between cells in the plant freezes and expands, causing tissue damage. Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate cellular injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures. Non-acclimatized individuals can survive −5 °C, while an acclimatized individual in the same species can survive −30 °C. Plants that originated in the tropics, like tomato or maize, don&#x27;t go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures. The plant starts the adaptation by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the signal to activate or repress expression of appropriate genes. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the stress, caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living cells. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature stress are shared with other abiotic stresses, like drought or salinity. 
 When temperature drops, the membrane fluidity, RNA and DNA stability, and enzyme activity change. These, in turn, affect transcription, translation, intermediate metabolism, and photosynthesis, leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on &quot;arabidopsis&quot; show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the absolute temperature. The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of calcium influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. Calcium channels in the cell membrane detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in &quot;alfalfa&quot; and &quot;arabidopsis&quot;. The response to the change in calcium elevation depends on the cell type and stress history. Shoot tissue will respond more than root cells, and a cell that already is adapted to cold stress will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn&#x27;t control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of reactive oxygen species and excitation of photosystem 2, which influences low-temp signal transduction mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.

Cold increases cell membrane permeability and makes the cell shrink, as water is drawn out when ice is formed in the extracellular matrix between cells. To retain the surface area of the cell membrane so it will be able to regain its former volume when temperature rises again, the plant forms more and stronger Hechtian strands. These are tubelike structures that connect the protoplast with the cell wall. When the intracellular water freezes, the cell will expand, and without cold hardening the cell would rupture. To protect the cell membrane from expansion induced damage, the plant cell changes the proportions of almost all lipids in the cell membrane, and increases the amount of total soluble protein and other cryoprotecting molecules, like sugar and proline.

Chilling injury occurs at 0–10 degrees Celsius, as a result of membrane damage, metabolic changes, and toxic buildup. Symptoms include wilting, water soaking, necrosis, chlorosis, ion leakage, and decreased growth. Freezing injury may occur at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. Symptoms of extracellular freezing include structural damage, dehydration, and necrosis. If intracellular freezing occurs, it will lead to death. Freezing injury is a result of lost permeability, plasmolysis, and post-thaw cell bursting.

When spring comes, or during a mild spell in winter, plants de-harden, and if the temperature is warm for long enough – their growth resumes.

==Insects==
Cold hardening has also been observed in insects such as the fruit fly and diamondback moth. These insects use rapid cold hardening to protect against cold shock during overwintering periods. Overwintering insects remain active through the winter while non-overwintering insects migrate or die. Rapid cold hardening can occur during short periods of undesirable temperatures. The buildup of cryoprotective compounds such as glycerol is one mechanism of cold hardening in insects. Glycerol interacts with other cell components in order to decrease the insect&#x27;s permeability to the cold. When an insect is exposed to cold temperatures, glycerol rapidly accumulates. Glycerol is a non-ionic kosmotrope forming powerful hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The hydrogen bonds in the glycerol compound compete with the weaker bonds between the water molecules, interrupting ice crystal formation. This reaction between glycerol and water has been used as an antifreeze in the past. Proteins also play a large role in cold hardening. Glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) is a key enzyme that increases in comparison to a control group not experiencing cold hardening. Once warmer temperatures are observed, the process of acclimation begins, and the increase in the concentrations of glycerol and other cryoprotective compounds is reversed. There is a rapid cold hardening capacity found within certain insects that suggests not all insects can survive a long period of overwintering. Non-diapausing insects can sustain brief temperature shocks but often have a limit to what they can handle before the body can no longer produce enough cryoprotective components.

In addition to improving insects&#x27; survival during cold temperatures, cold hardening also improves the organism&#x27;s performance. Rapid cold hardening (RCH), one of the fastest cold temperature responses recorded, allows an insect to quickly adapt to severe weather change without compromising function. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (the common fruit fly) is a frequently experimented insect involving cold hardening. An example of RCH enhancing organisms&#x27; performance comes from courting and mating within the fruit fly. Fruit flies mate more frequently once RCH has commenced, compared to a control insect group not experiencing RCH. Most insects experiencing extended cold periods are observed to modify membrane lipids. Desaturation of fatty acids is the most commonly seen modification to the cell membrane. When fruit flies were observed under a stressful climate, the survival rate increased in comparison to the fly prior to cold hardening.

In addition to the common fruit fly, the cold-hardening response of &quot;Plutella xylostella&quot; (the diamondback moth) also has been widely studied. While this insect also shows an increase in glycerol and similar cryoprotective compounds, it also shows an increase in polyols. These compounds are specifically linked to cryoprotective compounds. The polyol compound is freeze-susceptible and freeze tolerant. Polyols simply act as a barrier within the insect body by preventing intracellular freezing by restricting the extracellular freezing likely to happen in overwintering periods. During the larval stage of the diamondback moth, the significance of glycerol was tested again for validity. The lab injected the larvae with added glycerol and in turn proved that glycerol is a major factor in survival rate when cold hardening. The cold tolerance is directly proportional to the buildup of glycerol during cold hardening.

Cold hardening of insects improves the survival rate of the species and improves function. Once environmental temperature begins to warm up above freezing, the cold hardening process is reversed and the concentrations of glycerol and cryoprotective compounds decrease within the body. This also reverts the function of the insect to pre-cold hardening activity.

<text>Fritz Muliar, born as Friedrich Ludwig Stand (December 12, 1919 – May 4, 2009), was an Austrian actor who, due to his huge popularity, is often referred to by his countrymen as &quot;Volksschauspieler&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in Neubau, Vienna as the stepson of a jeweller, Muliar became a cabaret artist in the late 1930s. He was a Boy Scout in his youth. After serving in the Second World War, he was imprisoned by the Nazis in 1942 and spent seven months in solitary confinement for &quot;Betätigung zur Wiederherstellung eines freien Österreich&quot; (activities to restore Austrian independence—see Anschluss).

After the war, Muliar started his career as a stage actor. Of small build, he once said that his ambitions had never included playing parts such as that of Othello. Rather, he had always preferred comic roles and traditional Austrian fare (Johann Nestroy, Ferdinand Raimund). Muliar also excelled in imitating various accents, in particular those used by Czech and Yiddish speakers of German. In 1990, he had enormous success in Felix Mitterer&#x27;s play for one person, &quot;Siberia&quot; (televised in 1991), a study in ageism about an old man who has been abandoned by his family in a retirement home and his struggle for dignity.

While he also performed regularly at the Salzburg Festival in the play &quot;Jedermann&quot; (a version of &quot;Everyman&quot;), Muliar was associated with two Viennese theatres in particular: the Burgtheater (whose tenured member he was until his retirement), and the Theater in der Josefstadt, where he worked until his death in 2009. He was one of the severest critics of Claus Peymann (born 1937), director of the Burgtheater between 1986 and 1999 whose leadership polarized Austrian theatregoers by its focus on controversial playwrights such as Thomas Bernhard and Elfriede Jelinek. Musical theatre saw Muliar in the non-singing role of Frosch in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. At Theater in der Josefstadt, Muliar was perhaps best known for the role of Mr. Green in Jeff Baron&#x27;s Visiting Mr. Green (Besuch bei Mr Green). Muliar, Michael Dangl the theater and Jeff Baron were awarded the 2001 Kulturpreis Europa for this production, which ran for several seasons and was nationally telecast.

Muliar appeared in numerous films and in some television series such as &quot;Kir Royal&quot; (alongside Franz Xaver Kroetz) and &quot;Kommissar Rex&quot;. He is best remembered beyond the boundaries of his native Vienna for playing the title role in the 13-part TV series, &quot;Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk&quot;, which was filmed in German and broadcast by the Austrian state TV (ORF) in 1972.

Muliar was a committed Social Democrat who publicly supported various Austrian Social Democratic politicians during their election campaigns. He was married from 1955 to Franziska Kalmar, Austria&#x27;s first television presenter. In January 2006 he was elected to the position of a public advisor in the Austrian state TV (ORF). He died in Vienna, aged 89.

<doc id="1274221" wikidata="Q2356372" url="?curid=1274221" title="Licence Renewed">
<text>Licence Renewed, first published in 1981, is the first novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. It was the first proper James Bond novel (not counting novelizations and a faux biography) since Kingsley Amis&#x27;s &quot;Colonel Sun&quot; in 1968. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Richard Marek, a G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons imprint.

The release of &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; successfully relaunched the Bond literary franchise, being the first of 14 original novels by Gardner until his retirement in 1996. In that time frame Gardner also wrote two novelizations.

==Updating James Bond==
In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) approached Gardner and asked him to revive Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series of novels.

When hired to begin a new series of James Bond novels, author John Gardner was tasked with updating James Bond and his allies and transporting them into the 1980s.

Updating the time frame to the 1980s, Gardner&#x27;s series picks up the career of James Bond some years after the Fleming novels ended. Due to the time frame change Gardner&#x27;s series suggests that Fleming&#x27;s stories took place in the 1960s and 70s, rather than the 1950s and 60s.

Likewise with James Bond, his companions and allies, specifically those working for the British Secret Service such as M, Bill Tanner, Miss Moneypenny, and Q are also all transported to the 1980s, although Q is rarely mentioned and is mostly substituted by Ann Reilly, a genius of gadgetry who is promptly nicknamed &quot;Q&#x27;ute&quot; by fellow workers as well as Bond, not long before being added to Bond&#x27;s long list of romantic conquests.

The novel was initially titled &quot;Meltdown&quot; during the manuscript stage.

==Plot summary==
When &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; begins, M reminds Bond that the &quot;00&quot; section has in fact been abolished; however, M retains Bond as a troubleshooter (pun intended), telling him, &quot;You&#x27;ll always be 007 to me&quot;. Bond is assigned to investigate Dr. Anton Murik, a brilliant nuclear physicist who is thought to have been having meetings with a terrorist named Franco. Franco is identified and tracked by MI5 to a village in Scotland called Murcaldy. Since Murcaldy is outside of MI5&#x27;s jurisdiction, the Director-General of MI5, Richard Duggan, requests that M send Bond to surveil Murik. Relying on information that MI5 did not have, M orders Bond to instead infiltrate Murik&#x27;s castle and gain his confidence.

Bond makes contact with Murik at Ascot Racecourse, where he feigns a coincidental meeting, mentioning to Murik that he is a mercenary looking for work. Later, Bond joins Murik in Scotland at Murik&#x27;s behest and is hired to kill Franco, for reasons at the time unknown. Franco in turn has been tasked by Murik to kill his young ward, Lavender Peacock, because she is the true heir to the Murik fortune, which could only be proved by secret documents Murik keeps hidden in a safe within his castle.

Murik&#x27;s plan is to hijack six nuclear power plants around the world simultaneously with the aid of bands of terrorists supplied by Franco. To ensure that Murik can never be associated with this deal, he attempts to use Bond to assassinate Franco. Ultimately terrorists do take over six nuclear power plants, but are prevented from starting a meltdown when they are given an abort code by Bond, whom they believe to be Murik. Murik is eventually defeated by Bond and Lavender before his demands can be met.

==Characters==
* James Bond - agent 007
* M - head of the British Secret Intelligence Service
* Bill Tanner - M&#x27;s Chief of Staff
* Miss Moneypenny - M&#x27;s secretary
* Ann Reilly aka Q&#x27;ute - Q Branch
* Dr. Anton Murik: the current &quot;Laird of Murcaldy&quot;, owning the village of Murcaldy as well as most of the land surrounding it. Murik is a brilliant nuclear physicist who had been kicked out of the Atomic Energy Commission for his radical beliefs on the safety of nuclear power. Murik had claimed to have designed a nuclear reactor that was as powerful as a standard nuclear power plant, but safely disposed of the nuclear waste - a view debunked by many other nuclear physicists. To make a point to the world that the current nuclear power plants in use around the world were unsafe, Murik planned to have terrorists infiltrate six plants simultaneously and start a global meltdown.
* Mary Jane Mashkin: Murik&#x27;s mistress who attempts to become &quot;more than friends&quot; with James Bond to see if Bond was lying to Murik about being a mercenary looking for work.
* Lavender Peacock: Dr. Anton Murik&#x27;s ward. Unbeknownst to her, she is the true heir to the Murik family fortune.
* Caber: Murik&#x27;s personal bodyguard and the &quot;Champion of Murcaldy&quot;. He especially dislikes Bond for beating him in a wrestling match in which Bond cheated to ensure victory.
* Franco Oliveiro Quesocriado: an international terrorist leader wanted in most European countries as well as some in the Middle East. He aids Murik by supplying willing terrorists for his meltdown operation and additionally accepts the task of assassinating Murik&#x27;s ward, Lavender.

==The Silver Beast==
In &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; Bond drives a Saab 900 Turbo. For some editions of the book, the car is shown as black or red on the book cover; however, in the book the car&#x27;s colour is not mentioned. It only became silver and took on the nickname the &quot;Silver Beast&quot; in the follow-up Gardner novel, &quot;For Special Services&quot;.

The car is Bond&#x27;s personal vehicle, updated at his own expense by Communication Control Systems Ltd (CCS), a real-life company (now known as Security Intelligence Technology Group) that provided author John Gardner with ideas about feasible gadgets to be used. Consequently, Gardner gave them the credit in the book and not Q Branch.

With the release of &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; Saab Automobile took the opportunity to launch a Bond themed promotional campaign complete with an actual car outfitted like the one in the book (but using smoke instead of tear gas).

==Influence on future Bond films==
Some key plot elements in &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; may have had some influence on subsequent Bond films; most notably Anton Murik&#x27;s plot of a nuclear disaster with the aid of an infamous terrorist which was the basis of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. Other key elements from &quot;Renewed&quot; that appeared in future Bond films were Anton&#x27;s cheating at horse racing, which Max Zorin did in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, and the obsession with weapons, not unlike Brad Whitaker in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;.

==New 30th Anniversary reprints==
To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Licence Renewed&quot;, all fourteen of John Gardner&#x27;s James Bond books were republished by Orion in the UK starting in June 2011. The first five titles were released in hardback featuring their original covers. The rest of John Gardner&#x27;s Bond books were released in the UK as paperbacks in 2012 as a redesigned collection. In the US, Pegasus released the first three John Gardner titles in newly designed paperback in the autumn of 2011. The editions featured new introductions from luminaries in the world of Bond, and were followed by a complete re-issue of all 14 titles in the US.

==Publication history==
* UK first hardback edition: May 1981 Jonathan Cape.
* US first hardback edition: April 1981 Richard Marek/G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons.
* UK first paperback edition: 1982 Coronet Books.
* US first paperback edition: May 1982 Berkley Books.

The U.S. hardcover edition sold more than 130,000 copies.

==Reviews==
Reviews of the novel were mostly mixed.

Poet Philip Larkin writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, felt that the book had no life of its own and lacked Fleming&#x27;s compelling readability.

For Kingsley Amis, the book was &quot;So sodding tame&quot; and Gardner &quot;can&#x27;t write exciting stories.&quot; Later, Amis was to say the novel &quot;was bad enough by any reasonable standard.&quot;

&quot;Listener&quot; crime critic Marghanita Laski, a long-time admirer of Gardner&#x27;s books, said &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; &quot;is competent and has its funny moments. But this fine thriller-writer can&#x27;t perfectly adjust down to the simpler genre, and the world-destructive plot is a waste of Gardner, without ever really convincing as Bond.&quot;

Novelist Jessica Mann said in the &quot;British Book News&quot; that &quot;Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond books were never as crass as &quot;Licence Renewed&quot;. Writing for himself, Gardner is intelligent and original. In this Fleming rip-off, he reproduces Fleming&#x27;s faults without their saving charms, except that he has cut down on the sex and sadism. Fleming&#x27;s plots were always preposterous, but they carried a crazy, unifying conviction. Gardner&#x27;s is just illogical. And how the mighty Bond is fallen; he has become a dull, dim — too many knocks on the head in the past, perhaps? — middle-aged man who chooses the wrong trade-names to advertise.&quot;

Nicholas Shrimpton, in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, argued that Bond was best left in his own era. &quot;What John Gardner has failed to realise is that the charm of Bond is as strictly related to a sense of period as that of Sherlock Holmes or Philip Marlowe. Removed from this distinctive environment, Bond is a fish out of water. The glamour shrivels, the self-indulgence becomes apologetic, and the atmosphere seems absurd.&quot;

Robin W. Winks said in the &quot;Library Journal&quot; that &quot;Gardner lacks the sparkle of Fleming&#x27;s truly original plotting and humor, and Lavender Peacock simply is not Pussy Galore. What&#x27;s sound here isn&#x27;t very new and what&#x27;s new isn&#x27;t very sound. 007&#x27;s license is best left unrenewed.&quot;

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; crime fiction critic Derrick Murdoch complained that the villains were weak especially compared to Fleming&#x27;s own, and that love interest Lavender Peacock is &quot;a schoolgirl next to Pussy Galore.&quot; Murdoch also criticized the plot saying, &quot;The story line is also a bit cluttered. There&#x27;s one sub-plot about an international terrorist that seems derived indirectly from Robert Ludlum&#x27;s The Bourne Identity, and another about a stolen birthright that could come directly from Victorian melodrama. In his Liquidator series, Gardner showed that he can be much slyer, funnier and bawdier than he has allowed himself to be here. It almost seems he has approached his task too respectfully in Licence Renewed.&quot;

&quot;People Magazine&quot;&#x27;s anonymous reviewer felt that &quot;Gardner&#x27;s approach is sometimes too tame — as in the uninspiring title — but, on the whole, it&#x27;s a treat to have Bond working again. Welcome back, old friend.&quot;

Novelist Michael Malone commented in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;in &quot;License Renewed,&quot; the whole world seems scantier and blander, as if Bond could not shake off the malaise of those intervening years when the Government abolished his license to kill and stuck him in a desk job. He has less wit, less wardrobe and less sex drive. Miss Moneypenny even has difficulty arousing him. With his mechanized swashbuckling and elegant machismo, Bond was so suited to his time, so right in that age of astronauts and Thunderbirds, perhaps he should have decided you only live once.&quot;

&quot;Time Magazine&quot; praised Gardner&#x27;s &quot;way around military hardware, neo-villainy and a plot whose absurdity even Ian Fleming might admire. In classic style, Gardner piles picaresque on bizarre: Neanderthal henchmen, a medieval castle equipped with radar, cars that repel attackers with clouds of tear gas.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; believed Gardner was equal to the task. &quot;More tongue-in-cheek than Fleming, but mindless fun as usual: savory fluff for the curious and the old fans too.&quot;

<text>Zimbabwe African National Union – Ndonga (ZANU–Ndonga; formerly officially ZANU and unofficially ZANU Mwenje or ZANU Sithole) is a minor political party in Zimbabwe. Its members were originally part of Zimbabwe African National Union, but split with what would become ZANU–PF over tribal tensions. A portion of the party reunified with ZANU-PF in 2015.

== History ==
The Zimbabwe African National Union was a political party during the Rhodesian Bush War, formed as a split from the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. Its founders were the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Herbert Chitepo, who were dissatisfied with the militant tactics of Nkomo in ZAPU.

After Chitepo&#x27;s assassination on 18 March 1975, Robert Mugabe, in Mozambique at the time, unilaterally assumed control of ZANU. Later that year there was a factional split along tribal lines caused the Ndebele to follow Sithole into the moderate ZANU–Ndonga party, who renounced violent struggle, while the Shona followed Mugabe with a more militant agenda.

Sithole joined a transitional government of whites and blacks in 1979, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa. When sanctions remained in place, he joined Muzorewa for the Lancaster House Agreement in London, where a new constitution and elections were prepared. ZANU–Ndonga failed to win any seats in independent elections that swept Mugabe under the ZANU flag to power in 1980.

Declaring that his life was in danger from political enemies, Sithole went into self-imposed exile in the United States city of Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1983, returning to Zimbabwe nine years later to re-enter the political arena.

Sithole was elected a lawmaker for his tribal stronghold of Chipinge in southeastern Zimbabwe in 1995, as was a colleague. In December 1997 he was tried and convicted for conspiring to kill Mugabe and disqualified from attending the Harare parliament. He was granted the right to appeal, but no appeal was filed.

Sithole again won the Chipinge seat in June 2000, as ZANU–Ndonga&#x27;s only representative. Sithole died on 12 December 2000, aged 80, in Philadelphia, after going there for medical treatment.

ZANU–Ndonga&#x27;s candidate, Wilson Kumbula, won 1.0% in the March 2002 presidential election. After the parliamentary election held on 31 March 2005, the party remained without parliamentary representation.

Along with three other minor opposition parties, ZANU–Ndonga was a member of the Zimbabwe Organisation of Opposition Political Parties.

In 2015, some leaders of ZANU–Ndonga reunified with ZANU–PF, and called for supporters to &quot;leave the opposition&quot; and join the newly unified party.

<doc id="1274232" wikidata="Q2910672" url="?curid=1274232" title="Cognitive development">
<text>Cognitive development is a field of study in neuroscience and psychology focusing on a child&#x27;s development in terms of information processing, conceptual resources, perceptual skill, language learning, and other aspects of the developed adult brain and cognitive psychology. Qualitative differences between how a child processes their waking experience and how an adult processes their waking experience are acknowledged (such as object permanence, the understanding of logical relations, and cause-effect reasoning in school-age children). Cognitive development is defined as the emergence of the ability to consciously cognize, understand, and articulate their understanding in adult terms. Cognitive development is how a person perceives, thinks, and gains understanding of their world through the relations of genetic and learning factors. There are four stages to cognitive information development. They are, reasoning, intelligence, language, and memory. These stages start when the baby is about 18 months old, they play with toys, listen to their parents speak, they watch TV, anything that catches their attention helps build their cognitive development.

Jean Piaget was a major force establishing this field, forming his &quot;theory of cognitive development&quot;. Piaget proposed four stages of cognitive development: the &quot;sensorimotor&quot;, &quot;preoperational&quot;, &quot;concrete operational&quot;, and &quot;formal operational&quot; period. Many of Piaget&#x27;s theoretical claims have since fallen out of favor. His description of the most prominent changes in cognition with age, is generally still accepted today (e.g., how early perception moves from being dependent on concrete, external actions. Later, abstract understanding of observable aspects of reality can be captured; leading to the discovery of underlying abstract rules and principles, usually starting in adolescence)

In recent years, however, alternative models have been advanced, including information-processing theory, neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, which aim to integrate Piaget&#x27;s ideas with more recent models and concepts in developmental and cognitive science, theoretical cognitive neuroscience, and social-constructivist approaches. Another such model of cognitive development is Bronfenbrenner&#x27;s Ecological Systems Theory. A major controversy in cognitive development has been &quot;nature versus nurture&quot;, i.e., the question if cognitive development is mainly determined by an individual&#x27;s innate qualities (&quot;nature&quot;), or by their personal experiences (&quot;nurture&quot;). However, it is now recognized by most experts that this is a false dichotomy: there is overwhelming evidence from biological and behavioral sciences that from the earliest points in development, gene activity interacts with events and experiences in the environment. While naturalists are convinced of the power of genetic mechanisms, knowledge from different disciplines, such as Comparative psychology, Molecular biology, and Neuroscience, shows arguments for an ecological component in launching cognition (see the section &quot;The beginning of cognition&quot; below).

== History ==
Jean Piaget is inexorably linked to cognitive development as he was the first to systematically study developmental processes. Despite being the first to develop a systemic study of cognitive development, Piaget was not the first to theorize about cognitive development.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot; in 1762. He discusses childhood development as happening in three stages. In the first stage, up to age 12, the child is guided by their emotions and impulses. In the second stage, ages 12–16, the child&#x27;s reason starts to develop. In the third and final stage, age 16 and up, the child develops into an adult.

James Sully wrote several books on childhood development, including &quot;Studies of Childhood&quot; in 1895 and &quot;Children&#x27;s Ways&quot; in 1897. He used a detailed observational study method with the children. Contemporary research in child development actually repeats observations and observational methods summarized by Sully in &quot;Studies of Childhood&quot;, such as the mirror technique.

Sigmund Freud developed the theory of psychosexual development, which indicates children must pass through several stages as they develop their cognitive skills.

Maria Montessori began her career working with mentally disabled children in 1897, then conducted observation and experimental research in elementary schools. She wrote &quot;The Discovery of the Child&quot; in 1950 which developed the Montessori method of education. She discussed four planes of development: birth to 6 years, 6 to 12, 12 to 18, and 18 to 24. The Montessori method now has three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6, and 6–12. She was working on human behavior in older children but only published lecture notes on the subject.

Arnold Gesell was the creator of the maturational theory of development. Gesell said that development occurs due to biological hereditary features such as genetics and children will reach developmental milestones when they are ready to do so in a predictable sequence. Because of his theory of development, he devised a developmental scale that is used today called the Gesell Developmental Schedule (GDS) that provides parents, teachers, doctors, and other pertinent people with an overview of where an infant or child falls on the developmental spectrum.

Erik Erikson was a neo-Freudian who focused on how children develop personality and identity. Although a contemporary of Freud, there is a larger focus on social experiences that occur across the lifespan, as opposed to childhood exclusively, that contribute to how personality and identity emerge. His framework uses eight systematic stages that all children must pass through.

Urie Bronfenbrenner devised the ecological systems theory, which identifies various levels of a child&#x27;s environment. The primary focus of this theory focuses on the quality and context of a child&#x27;s environment. Bronfenbrenner suggested that as a child grows older, their interaction between the various levels of their environment grows more complex due to cognitive abilities expanding.

Lawrence Kohlberg wrote the theory of stages of moral development, which extended Piaget&#x27;s findings of cognitive development and showed that they continue through the lifespan. Kohlberg&#x27;s six stages follow Piaget&#x27;s constructivist requirements in that those stages can not be skipped and it is very rare to regress in stages. Notable works: &quot;Moral Stages and Moralization: The Cognitive-Development Approach&quot; (1976) and &quot;Essays on Moral Development&quot; (1981)

Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s theory is based on social learning as the most important aspect of cognitive development. In Vygotsky&#x27;s theory, adults are very important for young children&#x27;s development. They help children learn through mediation, which is modeling and explaining concepts. Together, adults and children master concepts of their culture and activities. Vygotsky believed we get our complex mental activities through social learning. A significant part of Vygotsky&#x27;s theory is based on the zone of proximal development, which he believes is when the most effective learning takes place. The zone of proximal development is what a child cannot accomplish alone but can accomplish with the help of an MKO (more knowledgeable other). Vygotsky also believed culture is a very important part of cognitive development such as the language, writing and counting system used in that culture. Another aspect of Vygotsky&#x27;s theory is private speech. Private speech is when a person talks to themselves in order to help themselves problem solve. Scaffolding or providing support to a child and then slowly removing support and allowing the child to do more on their own over time is also an aspect of Vygotsky&#x27;s theory.

== Beginning of Cognition ==
In cognitive development, the essential issue in beginning cognition is how the nervous system grasps perception and shapes intentionality in the sensorimotor stage (or before) when organisms only demonstrate simple reflexes (see articles perception, cognition, binding problem, multi sensory integration). The significance of this knowledge is that the mode to cognize at the stage without communication and abstract thinking, being a pre-requisite of social reality formation, determines the development of everything from cooperative interactions and knowledge assimilation to moral identity and cultural evolution that provides building societies (see also Social cognition and Collective behaviour). The contemporary academic discussion on a controversy in cognitive development (whether cognitive development is mainly determined by an individual&#x27;s innate qualities or personal experiences) is still in progress.

Many influential scientists argue that the genetic code is no more than a rule of causal specificity based on the fact that cells use nucleic acids as templates for the primary structure of proteins. However, it is unacceptable to say that DNA contains the information for phenotypic design. The epigenetic approach to human psychological development – that cascading phenotypic effects are not encoded directly in the genes – contrasts sharply with many so-called nativist approaches. Opponents of innate knowledge discuss four problems in appearance of the perception of objects.

The binding problem – According to cognitive psychologist Anne Treisman, the binding problem can be divided into three separate problems. (1) How are relevant elements that should be related as a whole selected and separated from elements that belong to other objects, ideas, or events? (2) How is the binding encoded so it can be transferred to other brain systems and used? (3) How are the correct relationships between related elements within the same object defined? This problem is also connected to the problem of multisensory integration in perception.

The perception stability problem – According to research professor of Liepaja University Igor Val Danilov, newborns and infants cannot capture the same picture of the environment as adults because of their immature sensory systems. They cannot sense environmental stimuli from social phenomena to the same extent as adults. The outcomes of processing similar sensory stimuli in immature and mature organisms differ. The corresponding holistic representations of objects can hardly occur in these organisms.

The excitatory inputs problem – According to the received view in cognitive sciences, cognition develops due to experience-dependent neuronal plasticity, e.g.. Neuronal plasticity refers to the capacity of the nervous system to modify itself, functionally and structurally, in response to experience and injury. However, the structural organization of excitatory inputs supporting spike-timing-dependent plasticity remains unknown. How is the relation between a specific sensory stimulus and the appropriate structural organization of the excitatory inputs in specific neurons formed?

The problem of Morphogenesis – Cell actions during an embryo formation, including shape changes, cell contact remodeling, cell migration, cell division, and cell extrusion, need control over cell mechanics. This complex dynamical process is associated with protrusive, contractile, and adhesive forces and hydrostatic pressure, as well as material properties of cells that dictate how cells respond to active stresses. Precise coordination of all cells is a necessary condition. Moreover, such a complex dynamical process likely requires clear parameters of the final biological structure – the complete developmental program with a template for accomplishing it. Collinet and Lecuit (2021) pose a question: what forces or mechanisms at the cellular level manage four very general classes of tissue deformation, namely tissue folding and invagination, tissue flow and extension, tissue hollowing, and, finally, tissue branching? They challenge the nativists&#x27; notion that shape is fully encoded and determined by genes: how are cell mechanics and associated cell behaviors robustly organized in space and time during tissue morphogenesis? They argue that not only gene expression and the resulting biochemical cues but also mechanics and geometry act as sources of morphogenetic information to ultimately define the time and length scales of the cell behaviors driving morphogenesis. Thus, it is not only the interaction of gene activity with events and experiences in the environment that contributes to the formation of tissues in morphogenesis. Because the nervous system structures operate over everything that makes us human, the formation of neural tissues in a certain way is essential for shaping cognitive functions. According to research professor Igor Val Danilov, such a complex process of shaping the determined structure of the nervous system requires a complete developmental program with a template for accomplishing the final biological structure of the nervous system. Indeed, because even processes of the cell coupling for shaping a nervous system during embryonal development challenge the naturalistic approach, how the nervous system grasps perception and shapes intentionality (independently, i.e., without any template) seems even more complicated.

So, the fact that gene activity interacts with events and experiences in the environment (as noted above) may not fully explain the integrative complexity of intentionality-perception development for beginning cognitive development. Nowadays, the Shared intentionality hypothesis is the only one that attempts to explain neurophysiological processes at the beginning of cognitive development at different levels of interaction, from interpersonal dynamics to neuronal interactions. It also solves the above noted problems. Professor of psychology Michael Tomasello hypothesised that social bonds between children and caregivers would gradually increase through the essential motive force of shared intentionality beginning from birth. The notion of Shared intentionality, introduced by Michael Tomasello, was developed by Research Professor Igor Val Danilov, expanding it to the intrauterine period. The Shared intentionality approach also points out that &quot;an innate sensitivity to specific patterns of information&quot; mentioned in the section &quot;Speculated core systems of cognition&quot; is also the outcome of Shared intentionality with caregivers, who obviously participated in the experiments.

== Jean Piaget ==

Jean Piaget was the first psychologist and philosopher to brand this type of study as &quot;cognitive development&quot;. Other researchers, in multiple disciplines, had studied development in children before, but Piaget is often credited as being the first one to make a systematic study of cognitive development and gave it its name. His main contribution is the stage theory of child cognitive development. He also published his observational studies of cognition in children, and created a series of simple tests to reveal different cognitive abilities in children. Piaget believed that people move through stages of development that allow them to think in new, more complex ways.

=== Criticism ===
Many of Piaget&#x27;s claims have fallen out of favor. For example, he claimed that young children cannot conserve numbers. However, further experiments showed that children did not really understand what was being asked of them. When the experiment is done with candies, and the children are asked which set they &quot;want&quot; rather than having to tell an adult which is more, they show no confusion about which group has more items. Piaget argues that the child cannot conserve numbers if they do not understand one-to-one correspondence.

Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development ends at the formal operational stage that is usually developed in early adulthood. It does not take into account later stages of adult cognitive development as described by, for example, Harvard University professor Robert Kegan.

Additionally, Piaget largely ignores the effects of social and cultural upbringing on stages of development because he only examined children from western societies. This matters as certain societies and cultures have different early childhood experiences. For example, individuals in nomadic tribes struggle with number counting and object counting. Certain cultures have specific activities and events that are common at a younger age which can affect aspects such as object permeance. This indicates that children from different societies may achieve a stage like the formal operational stage while in other societies, children at the exact same age remain in the concrete operational stage.

=== Stages ===

==== Sensorimotor stage ====
Piaget believed that infants entered a sensorimotor stage which lasts from birth until age 2. In this stage, individuals use their senses to investigate and interact with their environment. Through this they develop coordination between the sensory input and motor responses. Piaget also theorized that this stage ended with the acquisition of object permanence and the emergence of symbolic thought.

This view collapsed in the 1980s when research was put out showing that infants as young as five months are able to represent out-of-sight objects, as well their properties, such as number and rigidity.

==== Preoperational stage ====
Piaget believed that children entered a preoperational stage from roughly age 2 until age 7. This stage involves the development of symbolic thought (which manifests in children’s increased ability to ‘play pretend’). This stage involves language acquisition, but also the inability to understand complex logic or to manipulate information.

Subsequent work suggesting that preschoolers were indeed capable of taking others&#x27; perspectives into account and reasoning about abstract relationships, including causal relationships marked the demise of this aspect of stage theory as well.

==== Concrete operational stage ====
Piaget believed that the concrete operational stage spanned roughly from age 6 through age 12. This stage is marked by the development and achievement of skills such as conservation, classification, serialism, and spatial reasoning.

Work suggesting that much younger children reason about abstract ideas including kinds, logical operators, and causal relationships rendered this aspect of stage theory obsolete.

==== Formal operational stage ====
Piaget believed that the formal operational stage spans roughly from age 12 through adulthood, and is marked by the ability to apply mental operations to abstract ideas.

== Erik Erickson ==
Erikson worked with Freud but unlike Freud, Erikson focused on Biological, Psychological, and social factors in human development. Each stage is rooted in some kind of competence, or perceived ability to do things.

Each stage is defined by 2 conflicting psychological tendencies and by what traits develop in the stage dependent on how much of each tendency was experienced. There are virtues that develop in healthy circumstances and maladaptations that develop in unhealthy circumstances. It consists of 8 stages. While the conflicting tendencies may appear to be good versus bad. They can be considered as a balance where most healthy individuals experience some of each.

=== Stage 1-Infancy- Trust Versus Mistrust ===
A baby has very little ability to do anything for themself. As such infants develop according to whether they learn to trust or distrust the world around them. The virtue that arises during this stage is hope and the maladaptation is withdrawal.

=== Stage 2-Early Childhood- Autonomy Versus Shame ===
As a child starts to explore the world the conflict they experience is autonomy or a feeling of being able to do things themselves, verses shame or doubt, which is a feeling of being unable to do things themselves and fear of making mistakes. The virtue that arises during this period is will, suggesting a control over one&#x27;s actions. The maladaptation for this stage is compulsion, or lack of control over one&#x27;s actions.

=== Stage 3-Play Age- Initiative Versus Guilt ===
As a child grows from the stage of autonomy verses shame, they experience the conflict of initiative vs guilt. Initiative or having the ability to act in a situation against guilt or feeling bad about their actions or feeling incapable of acting. The virtue that develops in this stage is purpose and the maladaptation is inhibition.

=== Stage 4-School Age- Industry Versus Inferiority ===
As a child&#x27;s awareness of their effect on the world around them grows they come to the conflict of industry and inferiority. Industry meaning ability and willingness to proactively interact with the world around them and Inferiority meaning incapability or perceived incapability to interact with the world. The virtue that is learned in this stage is competence and the maladaptation is inertia or passivity.

=== Stage 5-adolescence- Identity Versus Identity Confusion ===
As a child grows into adolescence, their ability to interact with the world starts to interact with their perceptions of who they are, and they find themselves in a conflict between identity and identity confusion. Identity means knowledge of who they are and developing their own sense of right and wrong. Identity confusion meaning confusion over who they are and what right and wrong is to them. The virtue that is developed is fidelity and the maldevelopment is repudiation.

=== Stage 6-Young Adulthood- Intimacy Versus Isolation ===
During young adulthood, people find themselves in a place where they are looking for belonging in a small number of close relationships. Intimacy suggests finding very close relationships with other people and isolation is a lack of such a connection. The virtue that can arise from this is love and the maladaptation is distantiation.

=== Stage 7-Adulthood- Generativity Versus Stagnation ===
In this stage of life people find that along with accomplishing personal goals, they are either giving to the next generation, whether as a mentor or a parent or they turn towards themselves and keep a distance from others. The virtue that arises in this stage is caring and the maladaptation is rejectivity.

=== Stage 8-Old Age- Integrity Versus Despair ===
Those in the twilight of their life look back at their lives and either are satisfied with their life&#x27;s work or feel great regret. This satisfaction or regret is a large part of their identity at the end of their lives. The virtue that develops is wisdom and the maldevelopment is disdain.

== Current Theories of Cognitive Development ==

=== Core Knowledge Theory ===
Empiricists study how these skills may be learned in such a short time. The debate is over whether these systems are learned by general-purpose learning devices or domain-specific cognition. Moreover, many modern cognitive developmental psychologists, recognizing that the term &quot;innate&quot; does not square with modern knowledge about epigenesis, neurobiological development, or learning, favor a non-nativist framework. Researchers who discuss &quot;core systems&quot; often speculate about differences in thinking and learning between proposed domains. 

Research suggests that children have an innate sensitivity to specific patterns of information, referred to as core domains. The discussion of “core knowledge” theory focuses on a few main systems, including agents, objects, numbers, and navigation.

==== Agents ====
It is speculated that a piece of an infants’ core knowledge lies in their ability to abstractly represent actors. Agents are actors, human or otherwise, who process events and situations, and select actions based on goals and beliefs. Children expect the actions of agents to be goal-directed, efficient, and understand that they have costs, such as time, energy, or effort. Children are importantly able to differentiate between actors and inanimate objects, proving a deeper understanding of the concept of an agent.

==== Objects ====
Within the theorized systems, infants’ core knowledge of objects has been one of the most extensively studied. These studies suggest that young infants appear to have an early expectation of object solidity, namely understanding that objects cannot pass through one another. Similarly, they demonstrate an awareness of object continuity, expecting objects to move on continuous paths rather than teleporting or discontinuously changing their locations. They also expect objects to follow the laws of gravity.

==== Numbers ====
Evidence suggests that humans utilize two core systems for number representation: approximate representations and precise representations. The approximate number system helps to capture the relationship between quantities by estimating numerical magnitudes. This system becomes more precise with age. The second system helps to precisely monitor small groups (limited to around 3 for infants) of individual objects and accurately represent those numerical quantities.

==== Place ====
Very young children appear to have some skill in navigation. This basic ability to infer the direction and distance of unseen locations develops in ways that are not entirely clear. However, there is some evidence that it involves the development of complex language skills between 3 and 5 years. Also, there is evidence that this skill depends importantly on visual experience, because congenitally blind individuals have been found to have impaired abilities to infer new paths between familiar locations.

One of the original nativist versus empiricist debates was over depth perception. There is some evidence that children less than 72 hours old can perceive such complex things as biological motion. However, it is unclear how visual experience in the first few days contributes to this perception. There are far more elaborate aspects of visual perception that develop during infancy and beyond.

=== Shared Intentionality ===

This approach integrates Externalism (a group of positions in the philosophy of mind: embodied cognition, embodied embedded cognition, enactivism, extended mind, and situated cognition) with the Empiricist ideas about the beginning of cognition only from learning in the environment. According to the Externalism approach, communicative symbols are encoded into the local topological properties of neuronal maps, which reflect a dynamical action pattern. The sensorimotor neuronal network enables pairing the relevant cue with a particular symbol saved in the sensorimotor structures and processes that reveals embodied meanings. In this sense, the Shared intentionality theory does not contradict the Core Knowledge Theory while complements it.

Based on evidence of child cognitive development, experimental data from research on child behavior in the prenatal period, and advances in inter-brain neuroscience research, research professor at Liepaja University Igor Val Danilov introduced the notion of non-local neuronal coupling of the mother and fetus neuronal networks. The term non-local neuronal coupling refers to the pre-perceptual communication provided by copying adequate ecological dynamics by one biological system from another, both indwelling one environmental context. The naive actor (fetus) replicates information from the experienced agent (mother) due to the synchronization of intrinsic processes of these dynamic systems (embodied information). This non-local neuronal coupling succeeds due to a low-frequency oscillator (mother&#x27;s heartbeats) that coordinates relevant local neuronal networks in specific subsystems of these two organisms, which already exhibit gamma activity (similar embodied information in both). The registered cooperative neuronal activity in inter-brain research, so-called mirror neurons, is probably the manifestation of this non-local neuronal coupling. In such a manner, the experienced agent ensures one-direction conveying information about an actual cognitive event toward an organism at the simple reflexes stage of cognitive development without interacting through sensory signals. Obviously, any sensory communication between the mother and fetus is impossible. Therefore, non-local neuronal coupling mediates environmental learning early in cognition.

The notion of non-local neuronal coupling filled a gap in knowledge both in the Core Knowledge Theory and the group of positions in Externalism about the very beginning of cognition, which has also been shown by the binding problem, the perception stability problem, the excitatory inputs problem, and the problem of Morphogenesis. The nervous system of the young organism at the prenatal stage of development cannot alone solve the complexity of intentionality-perception development for beginning cognitive development. For the innate sensitivity to specific patterns of information (referred to as core domains according to the Core Knowledge Theory) or for pairing the relevant cue with a particular symbol saved in the sensorimotor structures (embodied information according to Externalism), the organism only with an ability of reflex responses should distinguish the relevant stimulus (an informative cue) from the environment with the cacophony of stimuli: electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations. The notion of non-local neuronal coupling explains the neurophysiological processes of Shared intentionality at the cellular level that reveal in young organisms the innate sensitivity and/or embodied meanings during cognition. The Shared intentionality approach shows how, at different levels of interaction, from interpersonal dynamics to neuronal coupling, the collaborative interaction emerges in the mother-child pairs for sharing the essential sensory stimulus of the actual cognitive event. Finally, research has already shown that the Shared intentionality magnitude can be assessed by emulating the mother-fetal communication model in dyads of mothers and children from 2 to 10 years old.

== Key Topics of Study in Cognitive Development ==

=== Language Acquisition ===
A major, well-studied process and consequence of cognitive development is language acquisition. The traditional view was that this is the result of deterministic, human-specific genetic structures and processes. Other traditions, however, have emphasized the role of social experience in language learning. However, the relation of gene activity, experience, and language development is now recognized as incredibly complex and difficult to specify. Language development is sometimes separated into learning of phonology (systematic organization of sounds), morphology (structure of linguistic units—root words, affixes, parts of speech, intonation, etc.), syntax (rules of grammar within sentence structure), semantics (study of meaning), and discourse or pragmatics (relation between sentences). However, all of these aspects of language knowledge—which were originally posited by the linguist Noam Chomsky to be autonomous or separate—are now recognized to interact in complex ways.

It was not until 1962 that bilingualism had been accepted as a contributing factor to cognitive development. There have been a number of studies showing how bilingualism contributes to the executive function of the brain, which is the main center at which cognitive development happens. According to Bialystok in &quot;Bilingualism and the Development of Executive Function: The Role of Attention&quot;, children who are bilingual have to actively filter through the two different languages to select the one they need to use, which in turn makes the development stronger in that center.

== Other theories ==

=== Whorf&#x27;s hypothesis ===

While working as a student of Edward Sapir, Benjamin Lee Whorf posited that a person&#x27;s thinking depends on the structure and content of their social group&#x27;s language. Per Whorf, language determines our thoughts and perceptions. For example, it used to be thought that the Greeks, who wrote left to right, thought differently than Egyptians since the Egyptians wrote right to left. Whorf&#x27;s theory was so strict that he believed if a word is absent in a language, then the individual is unaware of the object&#x27;s existence. This theory was played out in George Orwell&#x27;s book, Animal Farm; the pig leaders slowly eliminated words from the citizen&#x27;s vocabulary so that they were incapable of realizing what they were missing. The Whorfian hypothesis failed to recognize that people can still be aware of the concept or item, even though they lack efficient coding to quickly identify the target information.

=== Quine&#x27;s bootstrapping hypothesis ===
Willard Van Orman Quine argued that there are innate conceptual biases that enable the acquisition of language, concepts, and beliefs. Quine&#x27;s theory follows nativist philosophical traditions, such as the European rationalist philosophers, for example Immanuel Kant.

=== Neo-Piagetian theories ===
 Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development emphasized the role of information processing mechanisms in cognitive development, such as attention control and working memory. They suggested that progression along Piagetian stages or other levels of cognitive development is a function of strengthening of control mechanisms and is within the stages themselves.

== Neuroscience ==
During development, especially the first few years of life, children show interesting patterns of neural development and a high degree of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, as explained by the World Health Organization, can be summed up in three points.

# Any adaptive mechanism used by the nervous system to repair itself after injury.
# Any means by which the nervous system can repair individually damaged central circuits. 
# Any means by which the capacity of the central nervous system can adapt to new physiological conditions and environment.

The relation of brain development and cognitive development is extremely complex and, since the 1990s, has been a growing area of research.

Cognitive development and motor development may also be closely interrelated. When a person experiences a neurodevelopmental disorder and their cognitive development is disturbed, we often see adverse effects in motor development as well. Cerebellum, which is the part of brain that is most responsible for motor skills, has been shown to have significant importance in cognitive functions in the same way that prefrontal cortex has important duties in not only cognitive abilities but also development of motor skills. To support this, there is evidence of close co-activation of neocerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in functional neuroimaging as well as abnormalities seen in both cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the same developmental disorder. In this way, we see close interrelation of motor development and cognitive development and they cannot operate in their full capacity when either of them are impaired or delayed.

=== Cultural influences ===
From cultural psychologists&#x27; view, minds and culture shape each other. In other words, culture can influence brain structures which then influence our interpretation of the culture. These examples reveal cultural variations in neural responses:

==== Figure-line task ====
Behavioral research has shown that one&#x27;s strength in independent (tasks which are focused on influencing others or oneself) or interdependent tasks (tasks where one changes their own behavior to favor others) differ based on their cultural context. In general, East Asian cultures are more interdependent whereas Western cultures are more independent. Hedden et al. assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses of East Asians and Americans while they performed independent (absolute) or interdependent (relative) tasks. The study showed that participants used regions of the brain associated with attentional control when they had to perform culturally incongruent tasks. In other words, neural paths used for the same task were different for Americans and East Asians.

==== Transcultural neuroimaging studies====
New studies in transcultural neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that one&#x27;s cultural background can influence the neural activity that underlies both high (for example, social cognition) and low (for example, perception) level cognitive functions. Studies demonstrated that groups that come from different cultures or that have been exposed to culturally different stimuli have differences in neural activity. For example, differences were found in that of the pre motor cortex during mental calculation and that of the VMPFC during trait judgements of one&#x27;s mother from people with different cultural backgrounds. In conclusion, since differences were found in both high-level and low-level cognition one can assume that our brain&#x27;s activity is strongly and, at least in part, constitutionally shaped by its sociocultural context.

==== Understanding of others&#x27; intentions ====
Kobayashi et al. compared American-English monolingual and Japanese-English bilingual children&#x27;s brain responses in understanding others&#x27; intentions through false-belief story and cartoon tasks. They found universal activation of the region bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex in theory of mind tasks. However, American children showed greater activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus during the tasks whereas Japanese children had greater activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus during the Japanese Theory of Mind tasks. In conclusion, these examples suggest that the brain&#x27;s neural activities are not universal but are culture dependent.

== In underrepresented groups ==

=== Deaf and hard-of-hearing ===
Being deaf or hard-of-hearing has been noted to impact cognitive development as hearing loss impacts social development, language acquisition, and the culture reacts to a deaf child. Cognitive development in academic achievement, reading development, language development, performance on standardized measures of intelligence, visual-spatial and memory skills, development of conceptual skills, and neuropsychological function are dependent upon the child&#x27;s primary language of communication, either American Sign Language or English, as well as if the child is able to communicate and use the communication modality as a language. There is some research pointing to deficits in development of theory of mind in children who are deaf and hard-of-hearing which may be due to a lack of early conversational experience. Other research points to lower scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, especially in the Verbal Comprehension Index due differences in cultural knowledge acquisition.

=== Transgender people ===

Since the 2010s there has been an increase in research into how transgender people fit into cognitive development theory. At the earliest, transgender children can begin to socially transition during identity exploration. In 2015, Kristina Olson and colleagues studied transgender youth in comparison to their cisgender siblings and unrelated cisgender children. The students participated in the IAT, a test that measures how one may identify based on a series of questions related to memory. Overall it determines a child&#x27;s gender preference. It showed that the transgender children&#x27;s results correlated with their desired gender. The behaviors of the children also related back to their results. For instance, the transgender boys enjoyed food and activities typically associated and enjoyed by cisgender boys. The article reports that the researchers found that the children were not confused, deceptive, or oppositional of their gender identity, and responded with actions that are typically represented by their gender identity.

<doc id="1274233" wikidata="Q17035944" url="?curid=1274233" title="Snowbird (person)">
<text>A snowbird is a person who migrates from the colder northern parts of North America to warmer southern locales, typically during the winter. The southern locales include the Sun Belt and Hawaii in the United States, as well as Mexico and the Caribbean. Snowbirds used to primarily be retired or older, but are increasingly of all ages.

Conversely, a sunbird is one who leaves warmer locales in the summer, migrating to cooler locales such as higher elevations or more northerly regions.

== Profile ==

Snowbirds are typically retirees who wish to avoid the snow and cold temperatures of northern winter, but maintain ties with family and friends by staying there the rest of the year. In recent years, younger people with jobs tied to seasonal tourists often migrate southward, following the tourist season, to southern resorts. Some are also business owners who have a second home in a warmer location or whose business can be easily moved from place to place. Many families in the United States often spend their Christmas holiday time (up to 2 weeks) at beach resorts in Florida, California, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Some are people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder who wish to enjoy the longer daylight hours in the southern latitudes in winter. Some snowbirds bring their homes with them, as campers (mounted on bus or truck frames) or as boats following the East Coast Intracoastal Waterway southward.

== RVers ==

A significant portion of the snowbird community is made up of recreational vehicle users (RVers). Many own a motorhome for the sole purpose of traveling south in the winter. Often they go to the same location every year and consider the other RVers that do the same a &quot;second family&quot;. Many RV parks label themselves &quot;snowbird friendly&quot; and get the majority of their income from the influx of RVing snowbirds. Several areas in Florida and Arizona have large RV communities that appear and disappear seasonally. Quartzsite, Arizona, has been labeled &quot;white city&quot;, because from a bird&#x27;s-eye view all the motorhomes cover the landscape in white and then in the summer are gone. While historically Florida and Arizona have been the top RV snowbird locations, other southern U.S. states are experiencing a boom from snowbirds enjoying desert and tropical climates.

== Legal status ==
Many American snowbirds also use their vacation time to declare permanent residency in low- or no-tax income tax states and claim lower non-resident income taxes in their home states. By contrast, Canadian snowbirds usually retain residency in Canada in order to retain health benefits. Due to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act there are now additional implications for Canadian snowbirds in the United States.

<doc id="1274236" wikidata="Q168125" url="?curid=1274236" title="Zbigniew Messner">
<text>Zbigniew Stefan Messner (; 13 March 1929 – 10 January 2014) was a Polish communist politician and economist. His ancestors were of German Polish descent who had assimilated into Polish society. In 1972, he became Professor of Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice. In the 1980s, Messner held numerous high ranking posts within communist party apparatus. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) from 1981 to 1990, when PZPR was dissolved, member of the PZPR Politburo from 1981 to 1988, Deputy Prime Minister from 1983 to 1985, member of Sejm from 1985 to 1989, Prime Minister of Polish People&#x27;s Republic from 1985 to 1988 and member of the State Council of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic from 1988 to 1989. Additionally in the 1960s Messner was the chairman of Piast Gliwice football club.

== Early life ==
Messner was born on 13 March 1929 in Stryj, then located in Poland (now Stryi, Ukraine). After Soviet annexation of former Polish eastern regions in 1945, his family decided to leave Stryj and move to Gliwice. In 1953 Messner graduated Karol Adamiecki University of Economics in Katowice, where he continued to work in the following years as an academic worker.

== Political career ==
In 1954 Messner joined PZPR. In 1980 he became the chairman of the Katowice Voivodeship National Council. In the following year Messner was appointed First Secretary of the Voivodeship Committee of the PZPR in Katowice and member of PZPR Central Committee and Politburo. There he started to collaborate with Wojciech Jaruzelski, then prime minister and leader of the PZPR, who in 1983 made Messner his Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for economic affairs. When in 1985 Jaruzelski became the Chairman of the Council of State and resigned from the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, he appointed Messner as his successor. This move was not caused by Messner&#x27;s competence, but his loyalty and subjugation to Jaruzelski.

As economist and now Prime Minister, Messner was tasked by Jaruzelski with the implementation of some market elements into planned economy system in order to save Polish economy from collapse, while preventing political liberalization. Messner&#x27;s cabinet work led to adaptation of several bills, which included e.g. increasing the independence of state enterprises, allowing for the creation of private banks and privatisation, etc.

However Messner&#x27;s reforms coincided with drastic price increases and further economic recession. Moreover, the referendum on economic reforms in 1987, proposed by the government turned out to be a failure, because it did not receive enough votes to make its result binding. In 1988, a wave of strikes organized by the opposition&#x27;s &quot;Solidarity&quot; trade union spread throughout the country. Messner came under pressure of both opoposition and other factions within PZPR. In the Sejm (Parliament), members of pro-communist All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ), started to speak against Messner. The criticism within communist party forced Jaruzelski to pressure Messener to resign. Messner eventually resigned in September 1988, justifying his decision with &quot;health problems&quot;, and had to transfer power to Mieczysław Rakowski. After his resignation Jaruzelski gave him a seat in Council of State, in which Messner remained until the abolishment of the Council, creation of the office of President of Poland and presidential election in July 1989.

== Later life ==
After 1989 Messner retreated from political life and returned to academic career. He died in Warsaw on 10 January 2014.

<text>Cecil Howard Green (August 6, 1900 – April 11, 2003) was a British-born American geophysicist, electrical engineer, and electronics manufacturing executive, who trained at the University of British Columbia and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He was a cofounder of Texas Instruments. He and his wife Ida Green were philanthropists who helped found the University of Texas at Dallas, Green College at the University of British Columbia, St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas, and Green College at the University of Oxford. They were also major contributors to the Cecil H. Green Library at Stanford University, the Cecil H. &amp; Ida Green Graduate and Professional Center at the Colorado School of Mines, the Cecil H. &amp; Ida Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California San Diego, the Cecil &amp; Ida Green Building for earth sciences at MIT (designed by I.M. Pei), and the Cecil and Ida Green Tower (the headquarters of the international Society of Exploration Geophysicists in Tulsa, OK).

==Biography==
Born in Whitefield, England, in 1900, Green and his family migrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada and San Francisco, United States, where he witnessed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where Green attended UBC for two years before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning both a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1924.

Green met Ida Flansburgh in 1923 while working on his master&#x27;s thesis at the General Electric Research Center in Schenectady, New York. They were married for 60 years, until her death in 1986.

In 1941, Green and his partners J. Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott and H.B. Peacock bought Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI), primarily a petroleum exploration company. GSI began to manufacture a broader range of electronics equipment and instruments during World War II, including anti-submarine sonar detectors. In 1951 GSI spun off Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) to pursue the manufacture of a broader range of electronics equipment and instruments, while GSI, now as a wholly owned subsidiary of TI, continued to focus solely on oil exploration services.

Green was vice president (1941–1951), president (1951–1955) and chairman of GSI (1955–1959). He was vice president and a director of Texas Instruments and in 1976 was named an honorary director of the company. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970.
In 1978, he was given the inaugural Maurice Ewing Medal of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, its highest award.
In 1979 Green and his wife were awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1985, Green received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Cecil Howard Green died in 2003 at the age of 102.

== Philanthropy ==
The growth of TI made Green an enormously wealthy man, and he and Ida quickly set about giving his wealth away. The Greens&#x27; philanthropic efforts totalled over $200 million, and most of this money was given to education and medicine. He was given an honorary knighthood in 1991 (at age 91) by Queen Elizabeth II.

One gift was the founding of the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green branch of the University of California Systemwide Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP). This branch is located at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

It was because of Green&#x27;s gift that Green College, Oxford was founded in 1979. Green College merged with Templeton College in 2008 to become Green Templeton College, on the site of what was previously Green College.

Some of Green&#x27;s philanthropy at the University of British Columbia (UBC) was encouraged by William Carleton Gibson, a neurologist in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Both Gibson and Green referred to Gibson as &quot;Cecil Green&#x27;s most expensive friend&quot; due to his encouragement to fund the Cecil and Ida Green Visiting Professorship and Green College, University of British Columbia. In 1998, the UBC Alumni Association gave Green and Gibson alumni &quot;Lifetime Achievement Awards&quot; in recognition of their support for the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;UBC Reports 1998/10&quot;&gt; This issue of UBC Reports is also online in PDF form.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UBC Reports 1998/05&quot;&gt; This issue of UBC Reports is also online in PDF form.&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Laure Waridel, (born January 10, 1973) is a social activist, a writer, a professor of environment at the Université du Québec à Montréal, and a radio and TV commentator.

== Early years ==
Laure Waridel was born in Switzerland, in the village of Chesalles-sur-Oron just north of Lake Geneva in the Canton of Vaud. She has three sisters and a brother. When she was two, their new home was a dairy farm in Mont-Saint-Grégoire, Quebec, in the Montérégie region. It was not long before Laure became aware of the shift towards industrial farming methods and the vulnerability of farm producers. As a young girl, she worked at the Cadet Roussel organic farm in Mont-Saint-Grégoire, Quebec. She lives in Montreal and is the mother of two children, Colin and Alphée; Alphée was the subject of a 2012 documentary film, &quot;Alphée of the Stars (Alphée des étoiles)&quot;, by her father and Waridel&#x27;s then-spouse Hugo Latulippe. Waridel is now married to Bruce Johnston.

== Education ==
From 1990 to 1992, Waridel studied social sciences at the Cégep Lionel-Groulx. Subsequently, she earned a degree in sociology and international development from McGill University. She continued her university studies with a communications certificate from the Université du Québec à Montréal and a Master&#x27;s degree in law and environmental studies from the University of Victoria in British Columbia. Waridel earned a doctorate degree at the Geneva-based Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies.

== Social activist ==
After the Earth Summit (1992) in Rio, Waridel became one of the founders of Équiterre, a non-profit organisation based in Montreal and dedicated to promoting ecological and socially responsible choices through action, education and research. It focuses on four issues: fair trade, ecological agriculture, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, energy conservation, and ecological and socially just choices.

Laure Waridel was the president of Équiterre. Her collaborators are quick to say that Waridel&#x27;s considerable charm and communication skills were instrumental in getting Equiterre off the ground and in the success of the fair trade. Waridel is no longer an employee of Equiterre, but continues as its most public representative. She remains with the non-profit organization today as a consultant.

In 2002, she was named by Maclean&#x27;s Magazine as one of 25 Canadian personalities who are making a difference.

Waridel defended Gil Courtemanche&#x27;s novel &quot;Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali&quot; in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004. This novel eventually won the competition.

In 2012, she was made a member of the Order of Canada &quot;for her contributions as a writer, commentator and social activist on environmental issues, notably as co-founder of Équiterre&quot;. In 2016, she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

<doc id="1274244" wikidata="Q2423211" url="?curid=1274244" title="Longsight">
<text>Longsight is an inner city area of Manchester, England, south of the city centre, bounded by Ardwick and West Gorton to the north and east; Levenshulme to the south; and Chorlton-on-Medlock, Victoria Park and Fallowfield to the west. Historically in Lancashire, it had a population of 15,429 at the 2011 census.

==History==

As an ethnically and culturally diverse area, for many years, Longsight has been plagued by gang related violence, similar to that of nearby Moss Side. Most of the violence came from tensions between two rival gangs which fought &quot;turf wars&quot; with each other since the 1990s, resulting in many shootings and several deaths. The Gooch Gang, from neighbouring Moss Side, were jailed in 2009, Consequently, gun crime in Greater Manchester as a whole has fallen dramatically, from a high of 120 gang-related shootings in 2006 to just 16 in 2011.

==Governance==

Longsight has been in the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Gorton since boundary changes in 2024. The seat has been represented in Westminster by since 2024 July by Andrew Gwynne.

;Councillors
The area is represented on Manchester City Council by three councillors, currently Abid Chohan, Shahbaz Sarwar and Suzanne Richards. Abid Chohan was initially a Lib Dem councillor but defected to Labour ahead of the local council elections in 2010.

==Geography==

Previously known as Grindlow Marsh, it was incorporated into the City of Manchester in 1890. The district is bordered by Ardwick to the north, Rusholme to the west, Levenshulme to the south, and Gorton to the east, defined by Hyde Road, Grey Street, Stockport Road, Plymouth Grove, Daisy Bank Road, Pine Grove, Merwood Grove, Ash Grove, Longford Pl, Ayton Grove, Laindon Rd, Curzon Ave, Richmond Grove, Hathersage Road, Anson Road, Dickenson Road, Beresford Road, Old Hall Lane, Stockport Road, East Road, Pink Bank Lane, Nutsford Vale, Buckley Road and Mount Road. The old Roman road to Buxton (the A6, Stockport Road) bisects the area.

==Demography==

Longsight has a very ethnically diverse population. According to the 2011 UK census, 72.9% of the population is from non-white ethnic groups, a 20% increase over the 2001 figure of 52.7%. This includes 55.3% who describe themselves as South Asian or South Asian British (including 35.7% Pakistani, 11.4% Bangladeshi); and 9.7% Black or Black British. The largest religious group is Muslim with 53.8% of the population, compared with the 2001 figure of 34.7% Muslim and 38.6% Christian. 7.0% of the population declined to state a religion, with 12.7% stating no religion. The census tended to underestimate immigrant communities, and it is likely that these groups in Longsight were underestimated and are now proportionately larger.

There are a number of places of Worship in the area, including a large Pakistani community centre, a Jain temple, the Russian Orthodox Church of the Pokrov, Saint Agnes&#x27; Church, Bethshan International Church, and the British Conference of The Church of God (Seventh Day).

===Census table===
==Economy==

The main shopping centre is near the corner of Stockport Road and Dickenson Road, and contains a library and supermarkets as well as many smaller shops. Longsight Market, one of the busiest markets in the England, is located on Dickenson Road. It can be easily spotted by its brightly coloured profiled roofs. The market hosts a general market every Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and a second-hand market every Tuesday and Thursday. There are a large number of authentic Pakistani takeaway food shops and restaurants and a very wide variety of fresh fruit and vegetables and other supplies to cater for the interests of the various immigrant communities in the area.

==Architecture and housing==
 The area of Longsight contains many of the notable buildings of Victoria Park. Daisy Bank Road is a particularly good example, featuring Edgar Wood&#x27;s Grade I listed First Church of Christ, Scientist and the Edwardian art nouveau Chadlington House, as well as the residences of Charles Hallé and Emmeline Pankhurst. Pankhurst&#x27;s family house is also situated on the edge of Longsight at Plymouth Grove.

Larger Victorian period properties are predominantly clustered around the leafy western parts of Longsight, an area informally known as Westpoint. Many grand Victorian villas can also be found overlooking Crowcroft Park in the most southern part of Longsight.

Situated on Stockport Road near the main market of Longsight is Longsight Library. Run by Manchester City Council, it provides services such as borrowing books, adult education services and a child homework centre. Great measures have been taken to make the architectural view of new Longsight Library building aesthetically pleasing.

The Apollo Theatre, Longsight Market, Noman Newsagents, Crowcroft Park and new Longsight Library are the important places in the Longsight area.

==Transport==

===Railway===
A spur of the West Coast Main Line passes through Longsight, which is located between Manchester Piccadilly and Stockport.

The area was once served by Longsight railway station, but this was closed in 1958. The nearest station is now at Levenshulme, which provides local Northern stopping services between Manchester, Stockport and locations in Cheshire. Ardwick station is also situated nearby, on the Hope Valley line, but has a threadbare service.

Longsight Electric TMD and Longsight Diesel TMD service trains for Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and TransPennine Express. A plan to house Eurostar trains at Manchester International Depot was abandoned in the 1990s.

The earliest railway works was set up in 1842 by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway (M&amp;BR). Little is known about its early history, except that it produced fifteen single wheeler passenger engines to a design by Sharp, Stewart and Company. In 1846, the M&amp;BR was amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) under John Ramsbottom. One 0-6-0 was produced in 1858, but then the works closed down as the LNWR transferred its operations to Crewe. The Longsight steam locomotive depot provided engines for express trains to London and elsewhere, and for local passenger trains.

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are provided by Stagecoach Manchester. The 192, according to Stagecoach, is the busiest bus route in Great Britain, with around 9 million passengers carried annually. The service runs every 5–10 minutes daily until the late hours.

The following routes serve Longsight:
* 53: Cheetham Hill – Gorton – Rusholme – Old Trafford – Salford Quays – Pendleton 
* 150: Gorton – Levenshulme – Chorlton-cum-Hardy – Stretford – The Trafford Centre
* 191: Manchester (Albert Sq.)– Longsight – Levenshulme – Stockport – Stepping Hill Hospital – Hazel Grove
* 192: Manchester (Piccadilly) – Longsight – Levenshulme – Stockport – Stepping Hill Hospital – Hazel Grove
* 197: Manchester (Albert Sq.) - Longsight – Levenshulme – Green End – Stockport

===Roads===
The A6, which connects Carlisle with Luton, passes through Longsight; it connects the suburb with Stockport and Manchester city centre.

His disappearance was reported to police the following morning but, in spite of endless police searches, he was not found. 22 years later, in November 1986, Moors murderers Ian Brady (who had also lived in Longsight when he was younger) and Myra Hindley revealed that he was one of their victims, just as police had first suspected after arresting them for three other murders in October 1965. Despite numerous searches for his body on Saddleworth Moor, it has yet to be found.

==Cultural references==
Longsight was immortalised in song by local singer Ian Brown formerly of the Stone Roses on his album &quot;Solarized&quot;. The song was titled &quot;Longsight M13&quot; reflecting the postcode of the area, which begins with M13. Graffiti appeared locally saying &#x27;Stone Roses RIP&#x27; when the band split up, and &#x27;Free Ian Brown&#x27; when he was jailed. The song was written with Brown&#x27;s former bandmate, guitarist Aziz Ibrahim, who still lives in Longsight. Brown also mentions the area in the Stone Roses song &quot;Daybreak&quot; which contains the line &quot;From Atlanta, Georgia, to Longsight, Manchester&quot;.

<text>Stapeliinae is a subtribe of flowering plants within the tribe Ceropegieae of the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the family Apocynaceae. The subtribe comprises about 35 genera, including both the stem-succulent &quot;stapeliads&quot; and the horticulturally popular genera &quot;Brachystelma&quot; and &quot;Ceropegia&quot;. The largest number of genera are native to Africa, but a more limited number of genera are widespread in Arabia and Asia. Historically, a similarly circumscribed taxon was treated as a separate tribe, Stapelieae.

==Description==

Most of the genera of plants within the subtribe Stapeliinae are to varying degrees stem succulents, often referred to as &quot;stapeliads&quot;. Many of these resemble cacti, though are not closely related, as an example of convergent evolution. The stems are often angular, mostly four-angled in cross-section, but in some species there are six or more, with some species of &quot;Hoodia&quot; having more than thirty angles. In size they vary from less than 2.5 cm/1&quot; in length to over 2 m/6&quot; tall. The leaves are in most species reduced to rudiments, sometimes hardened and thornlike, arranged on bumps or tubercles on the angles. Some species, however, still have recognisable leaves, most notably the Indian species &quot;Boucerosia frerei&quot; (syn. &quot;Frerea indica&quot;), and some members of &quot;Tridentea&quot;. Stapeliads are most abundant in warm, dry climates. In Africa, there are two separate regions where stapeliads have most diversified: northeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Several species are endemic to the small island of Socotra off the Horn of Africa. The Arabian Peninsula, and most specifically the country of Yemen, contain another concentration of species. Several more are found in the drier parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Myanmar. A single species, &quot;Apteranthes europaea&quot; (syn. &quot;Caralluma europaea&quot;) is found in Europe, in the very southern part of the Iberian peninsula and in the island of Lampedusa. Stapeliads are often regarded as a climax group within the family because of their often structurally complex flowers. Certain aspects of these reproductive parts mirror the pollination systems in the orchid family and represent a case of parallel evolution though both groups are quite unrelated and have developed similar, though not identical means to achieve the ultimate goal of pollination and therefore reproduction. Most stapeliads use flies as pollinators, that are attracted to odours resembling dung or rotting meat, emanating from the flowers. Many of the flowers also bear some physical resemblance to rotting animal carcasses, leading to their popular name of &quot;carrion flowers&quot;. However, not all stapeliads smell bad, or attract flies. Some species use beetles, bees, wasps, butterflies or moths as pollinators. Stapeliad flowers range in size from mere millimetres in species of &quot;Echidnopsis&quot; and &quot;Pseudolithos&quot; to those of &quot;Stapelia gigantea&quot; that can reach 40 cm/16&quot; in diameter, and are some the largest of flowers to be found on any species of succulent. 

Flowers are actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) with 5 free or fused sepals and petals. Some petals are formed in a shape of a star while some have a tubular shaped corolla. On some species, a raised ring or annulus is present in the center of the corolla. Instead of stamens and pistils, stapeliads contain a pollinarium.

==Taxonomy==
The first use of the subtribe (using the name Stapelieae) was by George Don in 1838. Don&#x27;s taxon included both &quot;Ceropegia&quot; and &quot;Stapelia&quot;. Later workers, such as George Bentham, used these genera as the basis of two separate tribes, Ceropegieae and Stapeliae. The two tribes were formally reunited in 1991 as the tribe Ceropegieae. In 2004, Ulrich Meve and Sigrid Liede reintroduced the subtribe as a division of the tribe Ceropegieae, supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. Subsequent studies, including one in 2017, have confirmed the division of the tribe Ceropegieae into four subtribes, of which Stapeliinae is the most derived:
===Genera===
In 2014, Endress, Liede-Schumann and Meve placed the following genera in subtribe Stapeliinae. , some are treated as synonyms by Plants of the World Online.

<doc id="1274248" wikidata="Q2855987" url="?curid=1274248" title="Islam in Ethiopia">
<text>Islam is the second largest religion in Ethiopia behind Christianity. In 2024, 31.5% of the population was Muslim.

Islam in Ethiopia dates back to the founding of the religion; in 615, when a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in Mecca and migrate to the Kingdom of Aksum which was based in Ethiopia and which was ruled by Najashi, a pious Christian king. Ethiopia is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an as Abyssinia (Al-Habash). It is agreed by Islamic scholars that Najashi gave shelter to the Muslim refugees around 615–616 at Axum. Bilal ibn Ribah, the first Muezzin, the person chosen to call the faithful to prayer, and one of the foremost companions of Muhammad, was born in Mecca to an Abyssinian (Ethiopian) mother.

== Introduction ==

 Islam was in 2007 the second largest religion in Ethiopia with over 33.9% of the population. The faith arrived in Tigray, north of Ethiopia, at an early date, shortly before the hijira. The Kingdom of Aksum in Ethiopia was the first foreign country to accept Islam when it was unknown in most parts of the world. The kingdom also favored its expansion and making Islam present in the country since the times of Muhammad (571–632). Islam and Christianity are the two major religions and have co-existed for hundreds of years.

==History==

Muslims arrived in the Axumite Empire during the &quot;Hijarat&quot; as early disciples from Mecca, persecuted by the ruling Quraysh tribe. They were received by the Christian ruler of Axum, whom Arabic tradition has named Ashama ibn Abjar (King Armah in Ge&#x27;Ez and Amharic), and he settled them in Negash. Located in the Tigray Region. On the other hand, the principal center of Islamic culture, learning, and propagation has been Wello. The Quraysh sent emissaries to bring them back to Arabia, but the King of Axum refused their demands. The Prophet himself instructed his followers who came to the Axumite empire, to respect and protect Axum as well as live in peace with the native Christians. While the city of Medina, north of Mecca, ultimately became the new home of most of the exiles from Mecca, a 7th-century cemetery excavated inside the boundaries of Negash shows the Muslim community survived their departure.

The period of Fasilides (r. 1632–1667) gave Muslims a good opportunity to expand their religion throughout the country. Emperor Yohannis (r. 1667–1682) created a council of Muslims to establish their own quarters in Addis Alem, far from the Christians in the political commercial capital, Gondar town. Muslims were able to have their own space and the population of Muslims increased because of wider urbanization.

Islam and Christianity have had their conflicts within the country, from the birth of Islam into the 16th century Christians dominated the borderlands where Islam was more prominent. This brought about the settlement of Islam to Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. In the Dahlak islands, the first Muslims resided in the 8th century until the 10th century where Islam spread along the Red Sea and Islam was restricted to northern Ethiopia because Christianity was already more dominant in the rest of the country. The port of Zeila allowed Islam to enter through the eastern and central parts of Ethiopia where Christianity had not reached yet.

During the 19th century, Emperor Tewodros II (r. 1855–1868) demanded that his Muslim subjects convert to Christianity or leave his empire. Some Muslims converted due to coercion; non-converts moved to the western parts of the Gojjam, near Sudan, where they continued practicing Islam. Tewodros&#x27; successor, Emperor Yohannes IV (r. 1872–1889) continued to coerce Muslims into converting to achieve religious uniformity by ordering them to be baptized within three years.

Islam developed more rapidly in the eastern part of the Horn region, particularly among the Somali and Harari. This was challenged by the mostly Christian northern people of Abyssinia, including Amhara, Tigray and north western Oromo. However the north and northeastern expansion of the Oromo, who practiced mainstream traditional Waaqa, affected the growth of Islam in its early days. Historian Ulrich Braukamper says, &quot;the expansion of the non-Muslim Oromo people during subsequent centuries mostly eliminated Islam in those areas.&quot; However, following the centralization of some Oromo communities, some of them adopted Islam and today constitutes over 50% of their population.

In the 16th century, Muslims from the Adal Sultanate embarked on a Conquest of Abyssinia (&quot;Futuh al-Habash&quot;) under the command of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (referred to as Gragn Mohammed or &quot;Mohammed the left-handed&quot; in Amharic).

Under the former Emperor Haile Selassie, Muslim communities could bring matters of personal and family law and inheritance before Islamic courts; many did so and probably continued to do so under the revolutionary regime. However, many Muslims dealt with such matters in terms of customary law. For example, the Somali and other pastoralists tended not to follow the requirement that daughters inherit half as much property as sons, particularly when livestock was at issue. In parts of Eritrea, the tendency to treat land as the corporate property of a descent group (lineage or clan) precluded following the Islamic principle of division of property among one&#x27;s heirs.

===The First Hijrah===
When Mohammed saw the persecution to which his followers were subjected to in Mecca, he told them to find safe haven in northern Ethiopia, Abyssinia, where they would &quot;find a king there who does not wrong anyone.&quot; It was the first hijra (migration) in Islamic history.

The persecution his followers suffered was due to polytheists who harmed the weaker Muslims and blackmailed richer Muslims, causing a severe decline in business. The abuse the Muslims endured eventually led people to convert while others held their Islamic beliefs. Abdullah ibn Masud was a new convert and participated in a Muslim group where a member suggested reciting the Qur’an in Masjid al-Haram because the people of the Quraysh never heard it before. Abdullah agreed to do so and the polytheists were so amazed they pounded on him until he bled to prevent the verses from affecting them.

Subsequently, because of the threats early Muslims suffered the verses from An-Nahl were revealed. According to historians, these verses were specifically sent as instructions for the migration to Abyssinia. The threats by the polytheists were so harsh it prompted the Prophet to save his people and have them migrate to Abyssinia to escape the harassment making it the first migration in Islam.

===The fourth holiest Muslim city===
Ethiopia is home to Harar. According to UNESCO, it is regarded as the fourth holy city of Islam. It has 82 mosques, three of which date from the 10th century, as well as 102 shrines. The city of Harar is located in Eastern Ethiopia and got its role of being an Islamic center in the 16th century AD. Harar is contained by a , a wall built of local Hashi stone bonded together by mud and wood and it was able to protect the city from the invasion of the non-Muslim Oromo in 1567. Harar began to develop the characteristics of an Islamic city with the Shafi‘i school in the 19th century as well as Harar serving as a conduit for the spreading of Islam in the Oromo population during an Islamization campaign under the reign of Amir Muhammad.

The 82 mosques in Harar have served a religious and social function for society. Once a day men go and pray in the mosque while the women pray at home, though construction has begun to areas where women can pray as well. Mosques would also allow Islamic learning such as the interpretation of the Quran, the Arabic language, and the principles of Islam.

== Denominations ==

=== Sunni ===
Muslims in Ethiopia are predominantly Sunni. In Sunni Islam, there are four schools of thought and three of them are located in Ethiopia, the main one is held by the Shafi‘i school. Roughly 98% of Ethiopian Muslims are Sunni, whilst another 2% adhere to other sects.

=== Shia ===
Shia Islam is not represented in Ethiopia compared to other denominations.

=== Ibadism ===
Ibadis were allegedly seen as the most admirable Muslims to be eligible for the caliphate office and are known for being the earliest sect of Islam. There are about 500,000 Ibadis residing in North and East Africa as well as Oman and Tanzania.

=== Islamic Orthodox ===
The Orientalist notion defined Islamic Orthodoxy &quot;as the point of departure that consequently measured other practices and beliefs as syncretistic or pre-Islamic.&quot; J. Spencer Trimingham the author of &quot;Islam in Ethiopia&quot; examined the impacts of Islam in the country and arranged his analysis by a hierarchical typology of different forms of appropriation categorized as an &quot;orthodox system.&quot; Institutions of Islamic learning in Ethiopia were maintaining an Islamic Orthodoxy within the community.

== Muslim land rights ==

Muslims were one of the marginalized groups that were not allowed access to land until the 1974 revolution. The revolution brought forth major changes to the socio-political and religious position of Ethiopian Muslims. In Gojjam, most Muslims did not have access to land, but had ways to get around it. They could rent, buy land, or enter in a crop sharing verbal agreement with the landowner. Muslims did not have the right to own, administer, or inherit land they simply were only allowed to live as tenants. If a verbal agreement was not an option, another way Muslims were able to acquire land was by clearing out unoccupied land and settling there, but only if they were able to offer some type of service to the balebat. Muslims were marginalised in Ethiopia, but particularly in Gojjam.

== Rise of Salafism/Wahhabism ==
Salafism/Wahhabism is derived from al-salaf, signifying a link back to what is known as pure and authentic Islam. The main aspect of Salafism is the emphasis on the idea that there is only one God. In Ethiopia, the concept of Salafism applies to the resistance of pilgrimages to local shrines, celebration of the Prophet&#x27;s birthday and other practices. Saudi Arabia is known for the rise of Salafism in Ethiopia, but the arrival of Salafism in Ethiopia is due to the Italian occupation from 1936 to 1941. Many Ethiopians were making their way to hajj when they were subsidized by the Italians and introducing Salafi teachings to the town of Harar, before spreading to other parts of the country.

The Wahhabism movement began to spread in the 1990s due to the political transition in 1991 and the arrival of the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The EPRDF promised a change within Ethiopia&#x27;s religious groups through decentralizing the structure of ethnic federalism to enable Salafi&#x27;s to raise their activities. During this period, a new generation of Salafi&#x27;s emerged. Salafi teachings became widespread due to organizations in Ethiopia like, World Association of Muslim Youth (WAMY). the Islamic Da&#x27;wa and Knowledge Organization, and the Awolia College. Besides the organizations the Salafi movement was led by Oromo scholars who were developing the Salafi ideology in Ethiopia. The youth became involved in the movement and began to call people to align with the obligatory practices of Islam with strict Salafi teachings.

In January 2012 to August 2013, the city Addis Ababa was swarmed with protests by Muslim demonstrators because of the alleged government enforced al-Ahbash campaigns that they Muslims viewed it as an interference in religious affairs by the regime. The protests sparked concern within the regime of what looked like “extremism,” a concept that is accredited with the Salafi movement. Within the regime, local, and international observers are claiming that Wahhabism “extremists” are wanting to gain political power to turn Ethiopia into an Islamic State. Others have argued that Ethiopian Wahhabism are reluctant and opposed to getting involved in politics. Due to the expansion of the Wahhabism movement it has brought up intense debates over religious symbols and rituals, intrinsic to Ethiopian Islam.

== Sharia Court ==
All around the world, Sharia courts are designed to question and make decisions regarding Muslim law. Sharia courts have existed in Ethiopia since the country accepted Islam and the influence of the religion in the coastal areas that is surrounding the country. The courts became officially recognized by the state in 1942 when the Proclamation for the Establishment of Khadis Courts was issued. The Proclamation defined the authority of the courts, but was repealed in 1994 by the Khadis and Naiba Councils Proclamation, providing a three set of courts: the Supreme Court of Sharia, the High Court of Sharia and the First Instance Court of Sharia each with its own judges and necessary number of Khadis. The Khadis and Naiba councils decide on any questions surrounding marriage such as divorce and guardianship of children all that must be related to Mohammedans law or all the parties are Muslim. Also, the councils decide on any questions about wills or succession given that the donor or deceased was a Muslim. Lastly, the courts decide on any questions regarding payments of the cost incurred by the aforementioned decisions. The provisions provided by the courts made the Ethiopian Muslim courts similar to ones Sudan, Nigeria and other Africa countries where Sharia courts exist to handle the personal laws of the Muslim population.

In terms of gender equality, sharia law has a different approach to tackling gender equality. Islamic law contains different ways to treat women that can be applied to courts for example, divorce, partition of property, inheritance and many more. Final decisions made by the Sharia court are treated as an exception to the constitutional standard of Article 9(1), which states “The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. All laws, customary practices, and decisions made by state organs or public officials inconsistent therewith, shall be null and void.” It raises a question about Ethiopia&#x27;s commitment to human rights because personal status laws, which are under Ethiopia&#x27;s jurisdiction of sharia courts are considered an area of law which discrimination on the basis of gender is established.

==Muslims in contemporary Ethiopia==

Much as the rest of the Muslim world, the beliefs and practices of the Muslims in Ethiopia are essentially the same: embodied in the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah. There are also Sufi brotherhoods present in Ethiopia such as the Qadiriyyah order in Wello. The most important Islamic religious practices, such as the daily ritual prayers (&quot;Salat&quot;) and fasting (Arabic صوم, &quot;Sawm&quot;, Ethiopic ጾም, &quot;S.om&quot; or &quot;Tsom&quot; - used by Christians during their holy days as well) during the holy month of Ramadan, are observed both in urban centers as well as in rural areas, among both settled peoples and nomads. Numerous Muslims in Ethiopia perform the pilgrimage to Mecca every year.

In Ethiopia&#x27;s Muslim communities, as in neighboring Sudan and Somalia, many of the faithful are associated with, but not necessarily members of any specific Sufi order. Nevertheless, formal and informal attachment to Sufi practices is widespread. The emphasis seems less on the contemplative and disciplined mysticism, and more on the concentration of the spiritual powers possessed by certain founders of the orders and the leaders of local branches.

Muslims in contemporary Ethiopia have become actively engaged in challenging their political marginalization through the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front. They are persistent in wanting to engage with the EPRDF&#x27;s basis of political legitimacy and challenging their forceful secularism that limits religion to the private domain. In the context of electoral politics, Muslims have become increasingly involved in voting blocs. Their demands include expanding into Western financial institutions, consolidation with other parts of the Islamic world and the right to religious expression freely.

<text>George Gleig FRSE FSA LLD (12 May 1753 – 9 March 1840) was a Scottish minister who transferred to the Episcopalian faith and became Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

==Life==
He was born at Boghall Farm, near Arbuthnott in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of a farmer. He was educated at Arbuthnott Parish School.

At the age of thirteen he entered King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen, where the first prize in mathematics and physical and moral sciences fell to him. In his twenty-first year he took orders in the Scottish Episcopal Church, and was ordained to the pastoral charge of a congregation at Pittenweem, Fife, whence he removed in 1790 to Stirling. He became a frequent contributor to the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot; and the &quot;British Critic&quot;. In 1786 he declined the office of bishop of Brechin.

He also wrote several articles for the third edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, and on the death of the editor, Colin Macfarquhar, in 1793, was engaged to edit the remaining volumes. Among his principal contributions to this work were articles on Instinct, Theology and Metaphysics. The two supplementary volumes were mainly his own work.

In 1797 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Gregory, Sir James Hall, and Dugald Stewart.

He was twice chosen bishop of Dunkeld, but the opposition of Bishop Skinner, afterwards Primus of Scotland, rendered the election on both occasions ineffectual. In 1808 he was consecrated assistant and successor to the bishop of Brechin, in 1810 was preferred to the sole charge, and in 1816 was elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, in which capacity he greatly aided in the introduction of many useful reforms, in fostering a more catholic and tolerant spirit, and in cementing a firm alliance with the sister Church of England. 

He died at Stirling. He is buried in the chapel of Greyfriars Church in Stirling.

==Works==

*&quot;Letters containing an Apology for the Episcopal Church of Scotland&quot; (1787)
*&quot;Some Account of the Life and Writings of the late William Robertson&quot; (1812)
*&quot;Directions on the Study of Theology&quot; (1827)

Besides various sermons, Gleig was the author of &quot;Directions for the Study of Theology&quot;, in a series of letters from a bishop to his son on his admission to holy orders (1827); an edition of Thomas Stackhouse&#x27;s &quot;History of the Bible&quot; (1817); and a life of Robertson the historian, prefixed to an edition of his works. See &quot;Life of Bishop Gleig&quot;, by the Rev. W. Walker (1879). Letters to Alexander Henderson of Edinburgh and John Douglas, bishop of Salisbury, are in the British Museum.

==Family==

In 1789 he married Janet Hamilton (a widow née Fullton). She died in 1824.

His third and only surviving son, George Robert, was a noted soldier and chaplain.

<text>A diadem is a crown, specifically an ornamental headband worn by monarchs and others as a badge of royalty.

==Overview==
The word derives from the Greek διάδημα &quot;diádēma&quot;, &quot;band&quot; or &quot;fillet&quot;, from διαδέω &quot;diadéō&quot;, &quot;I bind round&quot;, or &quot;I fasten&quot;. The term originally referred to the embroidered white silk ribbon, ending in a knot and two fringed strips often draped over the shoulders, that surrounded the head of the king to denote his authority. Such ribbons were also used to crown victorious athletes in important sports games in antiquity. It was later applied to a metal crown, generally in a circular or &quot;fillet&quot; shape. For example, the crown worn by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands was a diadem, as was that of a baron later (in some countries surmounted by three globes). The ancient Celts were believed to have used a thin, semioval gold plate called a &quot;mind&quot; (Old Irish) as a diadem. Some of the earliest examples of these types of crowns can be found in ancient Egypt, from the simple fabric type to the more elaborate metallic type, and in the Aegean world.

A diadem is also a jewelled ornament in the shape of a half crown, worn by women and placed over the forehead (in this sense, also called tiara). In some societies, it may be a wreath worn around the head. The ancient Persians wore a high and erect royal tiara encircled with a diadem. Hera, queen of the Greek gods, wore a golden crown called the diadem.

The &quot;Priest King&quot; statue made by the Indus Valley civilization () wore a headband that is possibly a diadem.

By extension, &quot;diadem&quot; can be used generally for an emblem of regal power or dignity. The Roman emperor&#x27;s head regalia worn, from the time of Diocletian onwards, is described as a diadem in the original sources. It was this object that the Foederatus general Odoacer returned to Emperor Zeno (the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire) after his expulsion of the usurper Romulus Augustus from Rome in 476 AD.

<text>Alpha Comae Berenices (α Comae Berenices, abbreviated Alpha Com, α Com) is a binary star in the constellation of Coma Berenices (Berenice&#x27;s Hair), away. It consists of two main sequence stars, each a little hotter and more luminous than the Sun.

Alpha Comae Berenices is said to represent the crown worn by Queen Berenice. The two components are designated Alpha Comae Berenices A (officially named Diadem , the traditional name for the system) and B.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;α Comae Berenices&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Comae Berenices&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as &quot;Alpha Comae Berenices A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The system bore the traditional names &quot;Diadem&quot; and &quot;Al Dafirah,&quot; the latter derived from the Arabic الضفيرة &quot;ađ̧-đ̧afīrah&quot; &quot;the braid&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name &quot;Diadem&quot; for the component Alpha Comae Berenices A on 1 February 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Left Wall of Supreme Palace Enclosure&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Comae Berenices, Eta Virginis, Gamma Virginis, Delta Virginis and Epsilon Virginis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alpha Comae Berenices itself is (, .), representing (), meaning &quot;The First Eastern General&quot;. 東上將 (Dōngshǎngjiāng), westernized into &quot;Shang Tseang&quot;, but that name was designated for &quot;v Comae Berenices&quot; by R.H. Allen and the meaning is &quot;a Higher General&quot;.

==Properties==

Although Alpha Comae Berenices bears the title &quot;alpha&quot;, at magnitude 4.32 it is actually fainter than Beta Comae Berenices.

It is a binary star, with almost equal components of magnitudes 5.05 m and 5.08 m orbiting each other with a period of 25.87 years. The system, estimated to be 58 light-years distant, appears so nearly &quot;edge-on&quot; from the Earth that the two stars appear to move back-and-forth in a straight line with a maximum separation of only 0.7 arcsec. Eclipses are predicted to occur between the two components however they have not been successfully observed due to miscalculations of the time of eclipse.

The mean separation between them is approximately 10 AU, about the distance between the Sun and Saturn.

The binary star has a visual companion, CCDM J13100+1732C, of apparent magnitude 10.2, located 89 arcseconds away along a position angle of 345°.

Alpha Comae Berenicis forms an isosceles triangle with globular star clusters Messier 53 and NGC 5053. The apparent diameter of this triangle is a little more than one degree. The location of Alpha Comae Berenicis is westward (preceding) of both globular star clusters.

<text>The Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe was a coalition of two African Leadership parties: the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) which had worked together to fight against white minority rule in Rhodesia.

In 1980 elections ZAPU contested as Patriotic Front whereas ZANU contested as ZANU-Patriotic Front.

In 1988 the ruling ZANU absorbed ZAPU to become Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) for good.

<text>José Serra Chirico (; born 19 March 1942) is a Brazilian politician who has served as a Congressman, Senator, Minister of Planning, Minister of Health, Mayor of São Paulo, Governor of São Paulo state, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil.

==Early life==

José Serra was born in the São Paulo neighbourhood of Mooca to Francesco Serra, an Italian immigrant from Corigliano Calabro, Calabria, and Serafina Chirico, a Brazilian born to Italian parents. Serra comes from a lower middle class family. His father was semi-illiterate and worked as a fruit vendor in a market of São Paulo, but he was able to enroll his only child in college. In the early 1960s, he was a prominent member of the socio-political movement Ação Popular which opposed the conservative political system that existed at the time.

Serra interrupted his studies in engineering at age 22 and left the country in 1964, after the coup that established the military government in Brazil. Serra came to the attention of the authorities having served as President of the União Nacional dos Estudantes (UNE), (National Student Union) which opposed the existing conservative regime while he was a 4th year engineering student at the Polytechnic School at the University of São Paulo.

José Serra was in exile from 1964 to 1978 in Bolivia, France, Chile, and the United States. In Chile, he did his master&#x27;s degree in Economics and taught economics at the University of Chile (Universidad de Chile). There he also married Monica Allende (1967), then a top ballerina at the National Ballet of Chile. They had two children, Veronica (1969) and Luciano (1973). In the United States José Serra was awarded a Masters and Ph.D. in economics at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) and later spent 2 years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ.

On returning to Brazil after the political amnesty in 1978, Serra lectured in economics at the University of Campinas, did research for Cebrap, and wrote for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.

==Political career==
In 1982 he was appointed São Paulo&#x27;s State Secretary for Economics and Planning under Franco Montoro&#x27;s governorship, and became an influential secretary of Montoro&#x27;s government. In 1986 and 1990 he was elected and then reelected to Congress. In 1994 he was elected Senator for the State of São Paulo with more than 6.5 million votes.

His first bid for the mayorship of the City of São Paulo came in 1988 in an election won for the Worker&#x27;s Party (PT) by Luiza Erundina. He ran again in 1996, resigning as Minister of Planning to participate in the election for mayor, which was won by Celso Pitta. Pitta was the designated successor of mayor Paulo Maluf, who headed the right-wing populist Progressive Party (PP). After another stint as minister in the federal government, Serra ran for president on behalf of the PSDB party in 2002. He was beaten by four-time candidate and PT founder Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the second round.

In every elections since 1988 Serra represented the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), which he helped found in 1988 alongside former and future São Paulo State governors Franco Montoro and Mario Covas and future Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, from a split in the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). PSDB was seen as a coalition of democrats, liberals and social democrats with more centrist outlook than the leftist Workers&#x27; Party (PT) of presidents Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. Both parties have great support in São Paulo state, but the state has been governed by the PSDB since 1994.

Serra came to political prominence under Fernando Henrique Cardoso&#x27;s presidency (1994–2002), when he was appointed minister of planning, and later minister of health. During Serra&#x27;s tenure in the Health Ministry, the generic drug industry, which gave wider access to medicines to a poor population, and ANVISA, the Brazilian food and drug regulatory agency, were both created. All forms of tobacco advertising were banned, and cigarette packages were required to display images of smoking-related diseases.

=== Mayor of São Paulo ===

Serra was elected mayor of São Paulo in 2004, defeating incumbent Marta Suplicy in the second round. Serra created the Virada Cultural, a 24-hour cultural festival inspired by the French Nuit Blanche. He also established the Bilhete Único system in the São Paulo Metro subway system.

Serra sought nomination as the PSDB candidate for president in the 2006 elections, but on March 14, 2006, decided to run instead for governor of the state of São Paulo. He resigned as mayor of São Paulo, although he had signed a pledge to finish his four-year term. Gilberto Kassab, the deputy mayor, took office and remained the mayor until 2012. Serra won the governor&#x27;s race and on January 1, 2007, took office as the Governor of São Paulo State.
== Controversy ==
===Subway cartel===
Cases of corruption and cartel formation involving José Serra are relatively old, both in Brazil and abroad.
Two interlinked controversies: 
*the so-called Alstom case,
*Collusion between companies in the construction of the São Paulo subway.

===Brazilian oil fields===
Serra&#x27;s campaign was supported by American oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron. He secretly promised to sell the rights to Brazil&#x27;s newest petroleum discoveries in the pre-salt layer to those companies, reversing the model of da Silva. Serra ended state-owned oil company Petrobras&#x27; role as the chief operator of the pre-salt oil fields, which have an estimated value of three trillion dollars – twice the size of Brazil&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). WikiLeaks released several documents showing that Serra promised protection to Chevron in order to transfer control from Petrobras in case of election victory.

==Role in Brazilian politics today==

Serra was the presidential candidate of the incumbent Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) party in 2002, an election he lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula). In 2004, he was elected mayor of São Paulo in a run-off election with 55% of the votes after he signed a public commitment to stay in office for the full term. Nevertheless, he resigned after 15 months to run for governor of São Paulo in 2006, and was elected in the first round with almost 60% of the vote.

Serra announced another run for the Brazilian presidency as the PSDB candidate in the 2010 elections. He received support from his party, as well as the Socialist People&#x27;s Party (PPS) and the Democrats (DEM). His primary opposition in the election was Workers&#x27; Party (PT) candidate Dilma Rousseff. Serra&#x27;s candidacy received support from &quot;O Estado de S. Paulo&quot; and British newspaper &quot;Financial Times&quot;. In the first-round voting October 3, 2010, an unexpectedly strong showing from Green Party candidate Marina Silva forced a second round run-off election between Serra and Rousseff on October 31, 2010, which Rousseff won 56% to 44%.

In February 2012, Serra announced he would run for mayor of São Paulo, which would have resulted in his second non-consecutive term, though he had left the first one before it ended. In the second round of the 2012 municipal elections he was defeated by Fernando Haddad, the Workers&#x27; Party candidate.

In August 2021, Serra was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and went in a medical leave from the Senate, returning in February 2022. He later decided to run for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies after an invitation made by the Social Democracy Party. Serra got 88,926 votes, placing 5th in the PSDB list, not being elected for Congress.

<text>The primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, styled &quot;The Most Reverend the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church&quot;, is the presiding bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church. The current Primus is the Most Revd. Mark Strange who became primus on 27 June 2017.

The word literally means &quot;first&quot; in Latin and is cognate to the related episcopal title Primate.

==Roles==

The Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church has the following tasks:
*to preside at all provincial liturgical functions
*to preside at all meetings of the General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church
*to preside at all meetings of the Episcopal Synod
*to declare and carry out the resolutions of the General Synod, the Episcopal Synod and the College of Bishops
*to represent the Scottish Episcopal Church in its relation to all other churches of the Anglican Communion and other communions
*to perform the functions and duties of primus as specified in the canons of the Scottish Episcopal Church
*to correspond on behalf of the Scottish Episcopal Church with primates, metropolitans and the secretary general of the Anglican Consultative Council.

==History==
The primus does not have any metropolitan jurisdiction. Metropolitan responsibilities are held by the diocesan bishops. The last head of the Scottish Episcopal Church to hold both primate and metropolitan titles was Arthur Rose, Archbishop of St Andrews, up to his death in 1704. The last bishop to exercise metropolitan authority was Alexander Rose, Bishop of Edinburgh, up to his death in 1720.

<text>Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient ( Schröder; 6 December 180426 January 1860), was a German operatic soprano. As a singer, she combined a rare quality of tone with dramatic intensity of expression, which was as remarkable on the concert platform as in opera.

== Biography ==
Schröder was born in Hamburg, the daughter of the actress Sophie Schröder and the tenor Friedrich Schröder. The poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was her 2nd cousin.

Her first role was at the age of 15 as Aricia in Schiller&#x27;s translation of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, and in 1821, aged 17, she was received with so much enthusiasm as Pamina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; that her future career in opera was assured.
In 1823, she married Karl Devrient, becoming known as Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, but separated from him in 1828. Meanwhile, she had maintained her popularity at Dresden and elsewhere. She made her first Paris appearance in 1830, and sang in London in 1833 and 1837.

Richard Wagner, born in 1813, claimed to have seen her as Leonore in &quot;Fidelio&quot; when he was 16, but this is almost certainly fanciful. He did hear (and conduct) her in numerous roles after 1834, however, and continued to laud her stage artistry right up until his essay &quot;On Actors and Singers&quot; (1872) which is dedicated to her memory. She created several roles for Wagner – Adriano in &quot;Rienzi&quot;, Senta in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and Venus in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. Had Wagner&#x27;s political profile not been compromised by his involvement with the Dresden uprising in May 1849, Schröder-Devrient would have created Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; which was advertised in 1849 as a forthcoming production in Dresden.

In 1847 she married David Oskar von Döring, an officer, but divorced him in 1848. She took part in the Revolution of 1848 and the Dresden uprising and was later imprisoned. In 1850 she married , a wealthy Livonian land owner, who was 14 years her junior. They settled first in Trikāta, Latvia, relocating later to von Bock&#x27;s ancestral home in Loodi (Kersel) in Estonia. She left her husband in the winter of 1858, planning to move to America; but her health began to deteriorate rapidly.

She died in Coburg, Germany, on 26 January 1860.
== Apocryphal memoirs ==
After her death, an erotic memoir in two volumes, &quot;&quot; (Memoirs of a Songstress), was wrongly attributed to her.

<text>Andrew Bruce Cameron (born 2 May 1941) is a Scottish Anglican bishop who served as the Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney and the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

Cameron was born on 2 May 1941 in Glasgow, Scotland. He is the son of Andrew Macintyre Cameron and Helen Adam McKechnie. His brother, Douglas Maclean Cameron, was the Bishop of Argyll and the Isles from 1993 to 2003

Cameron was educated at Edinburgh Theological College between 1961 and 1964. After graduation, he was ordained a deacon in 1964 and a priest in 1965. He first served as curate at St Michael&#x27;s and All Angels&#x27; Church, Helensburgh in Argyll and Bute, from 1964 to 1967. He was then posted to another curacy at Holy Cross Church, Edinburgh from 1967 to 1970

Cameron&#x27;s quick advance in the church led him to become chaplain at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Edinburgh from 1971 to 1975. During this period he was the diocesan and provincial youth chaplain. Between 1975 and 1982, he was rector of St Mary&#x27;s Church in Dalmahoy, followed by Team Minister in Livingston from 1982 to 1988 and then the rector of St John&#x27;s Church in Perth from 1988 to 1992.

On 19 June 1992, he was consecrated Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney at St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Aberdeen. He was elected Primus on 1 November 2000.

At the meeting of the Primates of the Anglican Communion in February 2005, Cameron presented a summary of the worldwide responses to the Windsor Report on preserving the communion in the face of differences of opinion on sexuality.

Cameron stepped down as Primus in April 2006 and retired as Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney at the end of June 2006 (as he reached the clerical retirement age of 65). He is married to Elaine (née Gingles) and they have two sons. Following his retirement, he served as an assistant bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America for several months in 2008.

<doc id="1274285" wikidata="Q745457" url="?curid=1274285" title="Earth orbit rendezvous">
<text>Earth orbit rendezvous (EOR) is a method for conducting round trip human flights to the Moon, involving the use of space rendezvous to assemble, and possibly fuel, components of a translunar vehicle in low Earth orbit. It was considered as an alternative to direct ascent but ultimately rejected in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) for NASA&#x27;s Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because LOR does not require a spacecraft big enough to both make the return trip from Earth orbit to splash down in the ocean and a soft landing on the lunar surface. The two main proposed methodologies were: the in-space assembly of fueled spacecraft modules via docking techniques; and the in-space refueling of fully assembled spacecraft. This was the preferred approach adopted by the Soviet Union for achieving human lunar missions.

Three decades later, it was planned to be used for Project Constellation, until that program&#x27;s cancellation in October 2010.

==Gemini and Agena target vehicle==
The Agena target vehicle (ATV) was used for testing Earth orbit rendezvous in the NASA Gemini Program. Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 rendezvoused in orbit in 1965, but without Agena. Next, Gemini 8 successfully docked with the Agena on March 16, 1966. The Agena-Gemini rendezvous also achieved other objectives in later Gemini launches, including docked orbital maneuvering (Gemini 10 and Gemini 11), inspection of the abandoned Gemini 8 ATV (Gemini 10) and space walks (Gemini 12).

==Apollo==

The EOR proposal for Apollo consisted of using a series of small rockets half the size of a Saturn V to put different components of a spacecraft to go to the Moon in orbit around the Earth, then assemble them in orbit. Experiments of Project Gemini involving docking with the Agena target vehicle were designed partly to test the feasibility of this program.

In the end, NASA employed the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous for the Apollo Program: a Saturn V would simultaneously lift both the Apollo Command and Lunar Modules into low Earth orbit, and then the Saturn V third stage would fire again (Trans-lunar injection) to send both spacecraft to the Moon.

==Constellation==
This mode had been revived for Project Constellation as the Earth Departure Stage (EDS) and Altair (LSAM), which would be launched into low Earth orbit on the Ares V rocket. The EDS and Altair would be met by the separately launched Orion (CEV). Once joined in low Earth orbit, the three would then travel out to the Moon, and the Orion/Altair combination would fly a lunar orbit rendezvous flight pattern.

<doc id="1274303" wikidata="Q356457" url="?curid=1274303" title="Gavin McCann">
<text>Gavin Peter McCann (born 10 January 1978) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a midfielder in the English Premier League. He has one England cap to his name, playing against Spain at Villa Park in 2001. He is currently the First Team coach at Hyde United.

==Club career==
McCann played junior football for Y.M.C.A juniors in Lytham St Annes. He signed for Everton where he was a product of their academy. In 1998, he moved to Sunderland where he was a member of the side which won the Division One title and promotion to the Premiership with 105 points in 1999.

He signed for Aston Villa in 2003, where he had numerous injury setbacks. He scored one goal in the 2006–07 season in a 3–1 home loss to Manchester City. He was no longer guaranteed first team football, so decided to leave Villa Park, and in June 2007, he signed a five-year contract with Bolton Wanderers.

McCann scored his first goal for Bolton in their 1–0 UEFA Cup group win over Red Star Belgrade in December 2007 and followed this up with a goal in a 1–1 draw with Sporting Clube de Portugal at the Reebok Stadium three months later in the knockout stage of the cup. He scored his first league goal for Bolton in a 1–0 victory over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on 19 April 2008.

In November 2008 he received high acclaim from the Bolton manager Gary Megson who stated that the midfielder was playing some of the best football of his career since moving to the Reebok Stadium.

McCann&#x27;s contract ran out at the end of June 2010, McCann had picked up a knee injury and Owen Coyle said that once he recovered from the injury, he would have a chance to earn a new contract.

In early 2011, teammate Kevin Davies confirmed on the social networking site Twitter that McCann had retired from the game having failed to overcome injury.

==International career==
McCann has played once for the England national team, in a friendly against Spain at Villa Park in 2001.

==Coaching career==
In February 2008, McCann launched his own football academy in Lytham St Annes, the first one on the Fylde coast. The &quot;Milligan-McCann Academy&quot; is aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds and runs at King Edward VII and Queen Mary School. McCann teamed up with former Blackpool players, Jamie Milligan, who has been at Fleetwood Town since 2004 and John Hills who also signed for Fleetwood Town in August 2008, both of whom were born in Blackpool and grew up with McCann, to create the academy. In October 2008 the academy landed a major sponsorship deal with Northern Care, with coaching sessions continuing at King Edward VII &amp; Queen Mary School each weekend as well as week-long summer courses. The academy has also received a grant to encourage children to play &quot;park football&quot;.

After retiring, McCann remained active at Bolton Wanderers in the backroom at youth level.

In May 2012, he was appointed as Assistant Manager and first team coach at Hyde, alongside manager Scott McNiven. He left Hyde&#x27;s management team in early 2015, and studied for his professional coaching badges and also worked for Wrea Green FC on a Sunday morning whilst also playing in a soccer sixes league back where he started at Lytham YMCA.

In late 2015, he was back at Bolton, coaching their U15 team. In 2018, he was promoted to coaching Bolton&#x27;s U18 team. He left Bolton on 29 January 2021.

After six years back at Bolton working with the academy sides, he returned to Hyde United as the first team coach in February 2022, reuniting once again with his former Wanderers colleague Nicky Spooner.

==Personal life==
McCann lives in Lytham St Annes with his wife and children.

<doc id="1274305" wikidata="Q1562893" url="?curid=1274305" title="Skokomish River">
<text>The Skokomish River () is a river in Mason County, Washington, United States. It is the largest river flowing into Hood Canal, a western arm of Puget Sound. From its source at the confluence of the North and South Forks the main stem Skokomish River is approximately long. The longer South Fork Skokomish River is , making the length of the whole river via its longest tributary about . The North Fork Skokomish River is approximately long. A significant part of the Skokomish River&#x27;s watershed is within Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park.

== Etymology and naming ==
The Twana-language name for the Skokomish River is , meaning &quot;river.&quot; The North Fork Skokomish River is known as , and the South Fork Skokomish River as .

The name in English, &quot;Skokomish,&quot; comes from the Twana name for the Indigenous inhabitants of the Skokomish watershed, the Skokomish people, (also spelled &quot;&quot;, and meaning &quot;river people&quot; or &quot;people of the river&quot;). The Skokomish were the largest of the nine different Twana communities before their amalgamation onto the reservation in the 1850s. Within these nine communities there were at least 33 settlements.

==Course==
The Skokomish River and its two tributary forks drain the southeast corner of the Olympic Mountains, mainly in Mason County but including a portion of Jefferson County. The main stem Skokomish River is formed by the confluence of the North Fork and South Fork near small community of Mohrweis. It flows east through the broad Skokomish Valley. After being crossed by U.S. Route 101 the river turns northeast. Washington State Route 106 crosses the river near its mouth on Hood Canal. Near the towns of Union and Skokomish the Skokomish River enters Annas Bay at the bend of Hood Canal from the south, where it creates a large estuary called Skokomish Flats. The lower portion of the river flows along the southern portion of the Skokomish Indian Reservation.

The South Fork Skokomish River originates near Sundown Pass in Olympic National Park, near the sources of the Wynoochee River and Graves Creek, a tributary of the Quinault River. The South Fork flows southeast out of the national park and between Capitol Peak, on the west, and Wonder Mountain on the east. After receiving Rule Creek from the west the South Fork turns more directly south and enters a broader valley. It receives Church Creek from the west, then turns to flow southeast and east through a widening river valley. A number of tributary streams join the South Fork, including Pine Creek and Cedar Creek, from the south, and Le Bar Creek, Brown Creek, and Harp Creek from the north. The South Fork Skokomish leaves the main Olympic Mountains and enters flatter terrain, but flows through gorges for several miles. After exiting the gorges the South Fork turns east and enters the broad Skokomish Valley where it joins with the North Fork to form the main stem Skokomish River.

The North Fork Skokomish River originates on the northern slopes of Mount Skokomish. It flows west into Olympic National Park. The valley of the North Fork Skokomish is used for one of the national park&#x27;s main backcountry hiking trails. At the junction of Nine Stream, the river turns south, then turns southeast and receives a number of tributaries including Four Stream and Slate Creek. The river rushes over Staircase Rapids shortly upriver from Staircase Campground and the national park&#x27;s Staircase Ranger Station. The Staircase area is the main entry into the southeast portion of Olympic National Park. The North Fork receives Elk Creek at the campground and Lincoln Creek shortly downstream. The river then meanders southeast into Lake Cushman, a reservoir created to supply Tacoma with electricity. The tributary Big Creek enters the lake near Lake Cushman State Park. The North Fork exits Lake Cushman&#x27;s southern end and flows a short distance to another reservoir, Lake Kokanee, from which it flows south into the Skokomish Valley to join the South Fork, forming the main stem Skokomish River. Lake Cushman and Lake Kokanee are maintained by Cushman Dam No. 1 and Cushman Dam No. 2 respectively.

==History==
The Skokomish River area has been inhabited by humans for millennia. The Indigenous people of Hood Canal, the Twana, lived on and fished the watershed of the Skokomish River for generations. While all Twana did camp on the river and use its resources, it was primarily the Skokomish who lived along the river and at its mouth. The Skokomish would inhabit large winter villages during the winter months for traditional celebrations and activities; in the summer, they dispersed to various spots along the river and for hunting, gathering, and other activities. The Skokomish had four winter villages on the Skokomish River: at the confluence of the North and South Forks, called ; at McTaggert Creek on the North Fork (); slightly upriver from McTaggert Creek at a flat in the river called ; and below the falls at Lake Kokanee (). There were no winter settlements on the South Fork, but there were extensive summer settlements in the upper reaches of the valleys used for elk hunting. There were at least 20 settlement areas in total along the Skokomish River and the area at its mouth.

Prior to the construction of the Cushman Hydroelectric Project, the Skokomish River was once the largest and most productive salmon-producing river in the Hood Canal region of Puget Sound. The entire flow of the North Fork was normally diverted at Cushman Dam No. 2, except for instream flow requirements and infrequent larger releases. On January 12, 2009, Tacoma Power, the Skokomish Tribe, and state and federal agencies signed settlement agreements that resolved long-standing disputes and damage claims relating to the Cushman Hydroelectric Project. As part of the settlement water will be released into the North Fork Skokomish River below the dams in order to mimic natural flow.

The South Fork&#x27;s drainage was heavily logged, although logging has been significantly reduced in the Olympic National Forest since the late 1980s.

==Flooding==

The Skokomish is the most flood-prone river in Washington State, as it is the first river to flood during any major rain event. It set an all-time record-high flood level on December 3, 2007, when an intense tropical rainstorm moved in following several inches of snow from the day prior. Its maximum discharge of per second, recorded on December 3, 2007, was more than twenty times its mean flow, and bested its previous record set on November 5, 1934, at more than per second. The floods completely ripped up Highway 101 through the Skokomish Valley, resulting in two-day closure while emergency repairs were made. The 2007 flood event prompted Mason County officials and the Washington Department of Transportation in conjunction with the Skokomish Tribe, to design and construct a newer, elevated roadway structure over the area of Purdy Creek, which is the lowest point in elevation in the valley that Highway 101 crosses. After 16 months of planning and construction, a 350-foot bridge elevated 12 feet higher than the original roadway was opened in July 2009.

One notable flood in 1996 closed U.S. Route 101 and State Route 106 for four days, stranding a KOMO-TV news crew from Seattle. The Skokomish River is a popular location for television and print journalists to cover regional foods, including the joke &quot;Why did the salmon cross the road?&quot;

The combination of increased sediment load due to extensive clearcut logging, the reduced sediment carrying capacity due to the damming of the North Fork, and winter-weather rain patterns are suspected to be the primary reasons for the flooding that occurs almost every year on the South Fork. In late fall through early spring, storms often come from the southwest. These usually drop the most rain in the vicinity of the Skokomish River due to the topography of the Olympic Peninsula. Notably, the Skokomish Tribe, through the restoration of the Skokomish delta, (The Nallies Project), removed dikes surrounding Nallies Island, relieving some of the flooding in the valley. Recently on the second highest flood event recorded after the restoration, the flooding was only minor, compared with what it would have been before, moderate to severe flooding. Additionally, it is suspected that tectonic uplift of the land around the lower Skokomish River may be contributing to flooding by decreasing the gradient of the river channel, even prior to any major anthropogenic disturbances.

<doc id="1274309" wikidata="Q5280310" url="?curid=1274309" title="Direct ascent">
<text>Direct ascent is a method of landing a spacecraft on the Moon or another planetary surface directly, without first assembling the vehicle in Earth orbit, or carrying a separate landing vehicle into orbit around the target body. It was proposed as the first method to achieve a crewed lunar landing in the United States Apollo program, but was rejected because it would have required developing a prohibitively large launch vehicle.

==Apollo program==

The Apollo program was initially planned based on the assumption that direct ascent would be used. This would have required developing an enormous launch vehicle, either the Saturn C-8 or Nova rocket, to launch the three-man Apollo spacecraft, with an attached landing module, directly to the Moon, where it would land tail-first and then launch off the Moon for the return to Earth. The other two options that NASA considered required a somewhat smaller launch vehicle, either the Saturn C-4 or C-5. These were Earth Orbit Rendezvous, which would have involved at least two launches to assemble the direct-landing and return vehicle in orbit; and Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR), which carried a smaller two-man lunar lander spacecraft for flight between lunar orbit and the surface. LOR was the strategy used successfully in Apollo.

The Soviet Union also considered several direct ascent strategies, though in the end they settled on an approach similar to NASA&#x27;s: two men in a Soyuz spacecraft with a one-man LK lander. The Soviets attempted to launch the N1 rocket on 21 February and 3 July 1969, both of which failed, before NASA&#x27;s Apollo 11 lifted off and made the first crewed lunar landing on 20 July 1969. The Soviets would make two more attempts to launch the N1, in 1972 and 1974, but neither was successful. The Soviet engineering firm OKB-52 continued to develop the UR-700 modular booster for the direct ascent LK-700 ship.

Science fiction movies such as &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; and &quot;Destination Moon&quot; have frequently depicted direct ascent missions, although the first was a two-stage vehicle which accidentally, and successfully landed on Mars, but failed to successfully return to Earth (crashed in Nova Scotia), and the second was a single-stage vehicle which successfully landed on the Moon, and speculatively returned to Earth (return not shown).

<doc id="1274310" wikidata="Q7433120" url="?curid=1274310" title="Schwa (art)">
<text>Schwa is the underground conceptual artwork of Bill Barker (born 1957). Barker draws deceptively simple black and white stick figures and oblong alien ships. However, the artwork is not about the aliens: it is about how people react to the presence of the aliens and branding, and Barker uses them as a metaphor for foreign and unknown ideas. Schwa became an underground hit in the 1990s.

== Artwork and themes ==

In linguistics, a schwa is an unstressed and toneless neutral vowel sound in any language, often but not necessarily a mid-central vowel (rounded or unrounded). Such vowels are often transcribed with the symbol ə, regardless of their actual phonetic value. An example in English is the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;about&quot;.

For Barker, Schwa is alternately his pseudonym, a fictitious omnipresent corporation, a religion, or a resistance movement against corporate conspiracies and aliens. It is often a combination of all four at once.

Schwa artwork is black and white, with very precise stick-figures and ovoid alien faces and ships. The aliens themselves are rarely seen by the human stick figures, their presence is more often felt by their distant ships. The people are almost always either very frightened, or very complacent with their lot in life. Barker combines aliens, corporations, religions, media, and even the passage of time in his drawings.

The black and white drawings lead to a very hypnotic and very stark landscape. The world of Schwa is consistent throughout his work, and all the drawings and books combine to paint a single picture of a futuristic world run by large corporate and religious conglomerates who are possibly in league with omnipresent aliens. The media has become a marketing machine for these overseers, and they continually saturate the world with alien logos and messages such as &quot;In the future, everything will work&quot; and &quot;Stop domesticating yourself&quot;.

== History ==

Schwa began in 1992 when Barker, a former advertising art director, was looking for a way to express himself with a single art style when he was given a copy of &quot;The Secret Government&quot;, a conspiracy book that tells of aliens controlling the government. Barker did not like the idea of art exhibitions, which he saw as just a pretentious form of merchandising, so he decided to sell merchandise directly to consumers by mail-order. Barker started selling trinkets like necklaces and stickers, and his first book, &quot;ə&quot;, exclusively through this home-grown business. Schwa cartoons also appeared in &quot;The Sagebrush&quot;, the University of Nevada, Reno student newspaper.

Although Barker might not have been the first person to conceive of the ovoid alien face, his version quickly became the best-known. His book was an underground hit, and received praise from Terry Gilliam, Ivan Stang, and Noam Chomsky. He bundled the book along with several trinkets as the &quot;Complete Schwa Kit&quot; (), and put out another book with trinkets as &quot;Complete Counter-Schwa Kit&quot; ().

Eventually his popularity led to a book deal with Chronicle Books, and in 1997 published &quot;Schwa: World Operations Manual&quot; () a reference manual for world control that included postcards, stickers, warranties, contracts, and charts.

Barker also created and ran a (now defunct) labyrinthine website early in the days of the World Wide Web. He described it as &quot;an experiment in building an online science fiction environment in HTML.&quot; Instead of simply showcasing his printed artwork, the website became another medium for Schwa fans to explore.

== &quot;Schwa Pyramid&quot; ==
Barker teamed up with AOL to create an online game exclusively for AOL members. He worked with the now-defunct Orbital Studios to create a game about conspiracies, corporations, and aliens. The initial instructions set the tone of the game:

Don&#x27;t follow instructions. Suspect instructions. They are something to be wary of.

The player was a stick figure right in the middle of the darkened and conspiratorial world of Schwa. The player worked his way up the pyramid by collecting power through media, corporations, government, and labor, to eventually dominate the world.

The game launched on March 9, 1998. A follow-up game called &quot;Schwa Conspiracy&quot; was announced for later that year, but was never finished.

== Current status ==

Although a growing hit, Bill Barker disappeared from the public (and underground) eye sometime in late September 2001. His long-running website is dead and the post office box he had used for years now returns his mail unread.

In April 2008 a Schwa trademark was re-registered (assigned by Compuwatcher, Inc.) and a small series of websites were launched; this new Schwa business has no affiliation with Bill Barker or his artwork.

In March 2012 Barker created a Facebook page under the name alaVoid, which does not seem to be updated anymore.

<text>Jean Baptista von Schweitzer (12 July 1833 – 28 July 1875) was a German politician, dramatic poet and playwright.

==Life and political career==
Schweitzer was born at Frankfurt am Main, of an old aristocratic Catholic family. He studied law in Berlin and Heidelberg, and afterwards practised in his native city. He was, however, generally more interested in politics and literature than law.

Schweitzer was attracted by the social democratic movement, then led in Germany by Ferdinand Lassalle. Lassalle defended him from calls for his expulsion from the movement after he was convicted of a public indency charge for pederasty in 1862. Historian Gustav Mayer in 1909 described the incident as follows:

Schweitzer served two weeks in jail in Bruchsal for the offence. Lassalle argued that the &quot;abnormality attributed to Dr. von Schweitzer has nothing whatever to do with his political character.&quot;

After Lassalle&#x27;s death in 1864, Schweitzer on 20 May 1867, became president of the General German Workers&#x27; Association (, ADAV). The ADAV began fracturing soon thereafter, as disputes over whether to cooperate with Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s government led Wilhelm Liebknecht and others to leave the ADAV in the years after 1864. Liebknecht and August Bebel founded the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (, SDAP) in 1869.

Schweitzer edited the ADAV&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Der Sozialdemokrat&quot; (English: &quot;The Social Democrat&quot;), which brought him into frequent trouble with the Prussian government.

On 7 September 1867, he was elected as a deputy to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation, with the help of Lassalle.

In an article for &quot;Der Sozialdemokrat&quot; on 7 October 1868, he coined the term &quot;democratic centralization&quot;, now known as democratic centralism, to describe the structure of the ADAV.

On his failure to secure election to the newly formed German Reichstag on 3 March 1871, he resigned the presidency of the ADAV and retired from political life. The ADAV later merged with the SDAP at the Gotha Congress in 1875 to form the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (, SAPD), the forerunner of the modern-day Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

He died of pneumonia in Giessbach, Switzerland on 28 July 1875.

== Conflict with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ==
Immediately following the death of Lassalle, Schweitzer suggested to Liebknecht that Karl Marx should succeed Lassalle as president of the ADAV. In response, Liebknecht proposed to dissolve the office of the presidency and transform it into a board of directors, which would also control &quot;Der Sozialdemokrat&quot;. Schweitzer disagreed with the proposal regarding control of the paper and asked Marx, Friedrich Engels and Liebknecht to collaborate on the paper.

Marx assented to this proposal until breaking with Schweitzer, after suspecting Schweitzer knew of and supported Lassalle&#x27;s contact with Otto von Bismarck, then chancellor of the North German Confederation. This split was worsened by Schweitzer&#x27;s support of Bismarck published in articles in early 1865.

Marx and Engels compiled their criticism in an unpublished 6 February 1865 statement of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA), and finally made their split official with a public statement of the IWA justifying their decision, published in the papers &quot;Barmer Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Elberfelder Zeitung&quot; on 26 February 1865.

By March 1865, Marx was scathing of Schweitzer, writing in a letter to Engels on 10 March:

The author Hubert Kennedy identifies the latter statement as an instruction to joke about Schweitzer&#x27;s alleged homosexuality.

==Works==
Schweitzer composed a number of dramas and comedies, of which several for a while had considerable success. Among them may be mentioned:
* &quot;Alcibiades&quot; (Frankfurt, 1858)
* &quot;Friedrich Barbarossa&quot; (Frankfurt, 1858)
* &quot;Canossa&quot; (Berlin, 1872)
* &quot;Die Darwinianer&quot; (Frankfurt, 1875)
* &quot;Die Eidechse&quot; (Frankfurt, 1876)
* &quot;Epidemisch&quot; (Frankfurt, 1876)

He also wrote one political novel, &quot;Lucinde oder Kapital und Arbeit&quot; (Frankfurt, 1864).

<text>Lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) is a process for landing humans on the Moon and returning them to Earth. It was utilized for the Apollo program missions in the 1960s and 1970s. In a LOR mission, a main spacecraft and a lunar lander travel to lunar orbit. The lunar lander then independently descends to the surface of the Moon, while the main spacecraft remains in lunar orbit. After completion of the mission there, the lander returns to lunar orbit to rendezvous and re-dock with the main spacecraft, then is discarded after transfer of crew and payload. Only the main spacecraft returns to Earth.

Lunar orbit rendezvous was first proposed in 1919 by Ukrainian engineer Yuri Kondratyuk, as the most economical way of sending a human on a round-trip journey to the Moon.

The most famous example involved Project Apollo&#x27;s command and service module (CSM) and lunar module (LM), where they were both sent to a translunar flight in a single rocket stack. However, variants where the landers and main spacecraft travel separately, such as the lunar landing plans proposed for Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, Golden Spike and the 2029/2030 Chinese crewed effort, are also considered to be lunar orbit rendezvous.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===

The main advantage of LOR is the spacecraft payload saving, due to the fact that the propellant necessary to return from lunar orbit back to Earth need not be carried as dead weight down to the Moon and back into lunar orbit. This has a multiplicative effect, because each pound of &quot;dead weight&quot; propellant used later has to be propelled by more propellant sooner, and also because increased propellant requires increased tankage weight. The resultant weight increase would also require more thrust for lunar landing, which means larger and heavier engines.

Another advantage is that the lunar lander can be designed for just that purpose, rather than requiring the main spacecraft to also be made suitable for a lunar landing. Finally, the second set of life support systems that the lunar lander requires can serve as a backup for the systems in the main spacecraft.

===Disadvantage===
Lunar-orbit rendezvous was considered risky in 1962, because space rendezvous had not been achieved, even in Earth orbit. If the LM could not reach the CSM, two astronauts would be stranded with no way to get back to Earth or survive re-entry into the atmosphere. Rendezvous was successfully demonstrated in 1965 and 1966 on six Project Gemini missions with the aid of radar and on-board computers. It was also successfully done each of the eight times it was tried on Apollo missions.

== Apollo mission mode selection ==

When the Apollo Moon landing program was started in 1961, it was assumed that the three-man command and service module combination (CSM) would be used for takeoff from the lunar surface, and return to Earth. It would therefore have to be landed on the Moon by a larger rocket stage with landing gear legs, resulting in a very large spacecraft (in excess of ) to be sent to the Moon.

If this were done by direct ascent (on a single launch vehicle), the rocket required would have to be extremely large, in the Nova class. The alternative to this would have been Earth orbit rendezvous, in which two or more rockets in the Saturn class would launch parts of the complete spacecraft, which would rendezvous in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon. This would possibly include a separately launched Earth departure stage, or require on-orbit refueling of the empty departure stage.

Wernher von Braun and Heinz-Hermann Koelle of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency presented lunar orbit rendezvous, as an option for reaching the Moon efficiently, to the heads of NASA, including Abe Silverstein, in December 1958. During 1959 Conrad Lau of the Chance-Vought Astronautics Division supervised a complete mission plan using lunar orbit rendezvous which was then sent to Silverstein at NASA in January 1960. Tom Dolan, who worked for Lau, was sent to explain the company&#x27;s proposal to NASA engineers and management in February 1960. This alternative was then studied and promoted by Jim Chamberlin and Owen Maynard at the Space Task Group in the 1960 early Apollo feasibility studies. This mode allowed a single Saturn V to launch the CSM to the Moon with a smaller Lunar Excursion Module (LEM). When the combined spacecraft reaches lunar orbit, one of the three astronauts remains with the CSM, while the other two enter the LEM, undock and descend to the surface of the Moon. They then use the ascent stage of the LEM to rejoin the CSM in lunar orbit, then discard the LEM and use the CSM for the return to Earth. This method was brought to the attention of NASA Associate Administrator Robert Seamans by Langley Research Center engineer John C. Houbolt, who led a team to develop it.

Besides requiring less payload, the ability to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the LOR approach. The LEM&#x27;s design gave the astronauts a clear view of their landing site through observation windows approximately above the surface, as opposed to being on their backs in a Command Module lander, at least above the surface, able to see it only through a television screen.

Developing the LEM as a second crewed vehicle provided the further advantage of redundant critical systems (electrical power, life support, and propulsion), which enabled it to be used as a &quot;lifeboat&quot; to keep the astronauts alive and get them home safely in the event of a critical CSM system failure. This was envisioned as a contingency, but not made a part of the LEM specifications. As it turned out, this capability proved invaluable in 1970, saving the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts when an oxygen tank explosion disabled the Service Module.

=== Advocacy ===

Dr. John Houbolt would not let the advantages of LOR be ignored. As a member of Lunar Mission Steering Group, Houbolt had been studying various technical aspects of space rendezvous since 1959 and was convinced, like several others at Langley Research Center, that LOR was not only the most feasible way to make it to the Moon before the decade was out, it was the only way. He had reported his findings to NASA on various occasions but felt strongly that the internal task forces (to which he made presentations) were following arbitrarily established &quot;ground rules.&quot; According to Houbolt, these ground rules were constraining NASA&#x27;s thinking about the lunar mission—and causing LOR to be ruled out before it was fairly considered.

In November 1961, Houbolt took the bold step of skipping proper channels and writing a nine-page private letter directly to associate administrator Robert C. Seamans. &quot;Somewhat as a voice in the wilderness,&quot; Houbolt protested LOR&#x27;s exclusion. &quot;Do we want to go to the Moon or not?&quot; the Langley engineer asked. &quot;Why is Nova, with its ponderous size simply just accepted, and why is a much less grandiose scheme involving rendezvous ostracized or put on the defensive? I fully realize that contacting you in this manner is somewhat unorthodox,&quot; Houbolt admitted, &quot;but the issues at stake are crucial enough to us all that an unusual course is warranted.&quot;

It took two weeks for Seamans to reply to Houbolt&#x27;s letter. The associate administrator agreed that &quot;it would be extremely harmful to our organization and to the country if our qualified staff were unduly limited by restrictive guidelines.&quot; He assured Houbolt that NASA would in the future be paying more attention to LOR than it had up to this time.
In the following months, NASA did just that, and to the surprise of many both inside and outside the agency, LOR quickly became the front runner. Several factors decided the issue in its favor. First, there was growing disenchantment with the idea of direct ascent due to the time and money it was going to take to develop a diameter Nova rocket, compared to the diameter Saturn V. Second, there was increasing technical apprehension over how the relatively large spacecraft demanded by Earth-orbit rendezvous would be able to maneuver to a soft landing on the Moon. As one NASA engineer who changed his mind explained: The business of eyeballing that thing down to the Moon really didn&#x27;t have a satisfactory answer. The best thing about LOR was that it allowed us to build a separate vehicle for landing.

The first major group to change its opinion in favor of LOR was Robert Gilruth&#x27;s Space Task Group, which was still located at Langley but was soon to move to Houston as the Manned Spacecraft Center. The second to come over was Wernher von Braun&#x27;s team at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. These two powerful groups, along with the engineers who had originally developed the plan at Langley, persuaded key officials at NASA Headquarters, notably Administrator James Webb, who had been holding out for direct ascent, that LOR was the only way to land on the Moon by 1969. Webb approved LOR in July 1962. The decision was officially announced at a press conference on July 11, 1962. President Kennedy&#x27;s science adviser, Jerome Wiesner, remained firmly opposed to LOR.

==Other plans using LOR==

* The proposed Soviet lunar landing plan, using the N1 rocket, LK Lander and Soyuz 7K-LOK, would have used a similar LOR mission profile.
* The Constellation program would have used a combination of EOR and LOR for Moon landing.
* The Artemis program plans to use rendezvous in an NRHO near the Moon to land humans on the lunar south pole region.
* The Chinese Lunar Exploration Program has described a lunar landing mission using LOR.

==In popular culture==
Episode 5 of the 1998 television miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Spider&quot;, dramatizes John Houbolt&#x27;s first attempt to convince NASA to adopt LOR for the Apollo Program in 1961, and traces the development of the LM up to its first crewed test flight, Apollo 9, in 1969. The episode is named after the Apollo 9 Lunar Module.

<text>Castlebay ( ) is the main village and a community council area on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The village is located on the south coast of the island, and overlooks a bay in the Atlantic Ocean dominated by Kisimul Castle, as well as nearby islands such as Vatersay. Castlebay is also within the parish of Barra. The village is located on the A888, which serves as a circular road around Barra. In 1971, it had a population of 307.

==Community==

Castlebay is home to the majority of shops on the island. The main street forms a square with the ferry terminal and the ring road, and features several grocery shops, a bank, post office, and tourist information centre. There is a larger supermarket to the west of the village, having opened in October 2009. There are also several hotels in the village, plus the island&#x27;s medical centre, a petrol station and the police station.

===Church===
Our Lady, Star of the Sea, a Roman Catholic church, was opened in 1888 on a mound overlooking the town centre. It was designed by an architect from Oban, G. Woulfe Brenan, along with a house further down the slope for the priest to reside in. The northern gable of the church features a stained glass window depicting the Crucifixion, and the southern gables depict Our Lady, Star of the Sea. Renovation works on the church were completed in early 2007.

===Education===
The Castlebay Community School (), is located on the western side of Castlebay. It is the only source of secondary education on Barra. Since 2007, the school has had responsibility for the Castlebay preschool (both the English and the Gaelic Medium), meaning that with its Primary School division it caters for all ages of school children. 

Since 1992 Castlebay High School has provided full secondary school facilities. Until then Barra pupils studying for Highers had to board in Stornoway and attend school there. 

In September 2007, the school received an HMIE report negatively criticised relationships among the secondary school&#x27;s staff and management, but praised those in the primary school. 

In September 2022 the Island received £1 million for Gaelic development at the Castlebay education and health hub.

==History==
Kisimul Castle is located approximately away from the ferry terminal in the centre of the bay that Castlebay overlooks. Kisimul was abandoned in 1838 when the island was sold, and the castle&#x27;s condition subsequently deteriorated. Some of its stone was used as ballast for fishing vessels, and some even ended up as paving in Glasgow. The remains of the castle, along with most of the island of Barra, were purchased in 1937 by Robert Lister MacNeil, the Chief of Clan MacNeil, who made efforts at restoration.

In 2001, the castle was leased by the Chief of Clan MacNeil to Historic Scotland for 1,000 years for the annual sum of £1 and a bottle of whisky. 

For the 2011 census the island was classified by the National Records of Scotland as an inhabited island that &quot;had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses&quot;.
==Media==
Castlebay was the main setting for the 1949 Ealing Studios comedy, &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot;, and its 1957 sequel, 
&quot;Rockets Galore!&quot;, which were both filmed on Barra. The earlier film is based on the novel &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; by Sir Compton Mackenzie, itself a fictionalised telling of the story of the SS &quot;Politician&quot;, which ran aground with a cargo of some 50,000 cases of whisky on board in 1941. Mackenzie, who lived near the airport and died in 1972, is buried in a grave marked by a simple cross at cemetery, which is situated a little way up the hillside overlooking Eoligarry jetty.

In the 2010 Channel 4 programme &quot;Dom Joly and the Black Island&quot;, Joly and Tintinologist Michael Farr identify Castlebay and Kisimul as the locations of Kiltoch and the Ben More Castle used as settings in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic &quot;The Black Island&quot;, although the scenes of reaching it by boat and exploring it on foot were filmed at Lochranza Castle on the Isle of Arran.

In 2011, 18 episodes, series 5 and 6, of An Island Parish were screened on BBC2 documenting the arrival and subsequent experiences of a new Catholic priest on the island, Father John Paul.

== Transport ==

Castlebay is home to the main ferry terminal, which is operated by Caledonian MacBrayne. It is known that steam ferries were plying between Castlebay and Oban in the late 1800s, but travelling conditions were poor.
The first roll-on-roll-off ferry was the MV Iona in 1974, which could load broadside on, which was necessary until the 1980s, when a purpose-built bow loading ramp for vehicles was built at Castlebay, allowing much larger ferries to dock and resulted in quicker loading times.

Between 1989 and 1998, travelled daily between Oban, Castlebay and Lochboisdale on the island of South Uist, sometimes stopping on the Isle of Mull. In 1998, replaced &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot; on the Oban-Castlebay-Lochboisdale run. From April 2016, the former Stornoway ferry took over the Barra route with a new dedicated service, operating seven return sailings a week between Castlebay and Oban, allowing &quot;Clansman&quot; to operate dedicated services from Oban to Coll, Tiree and Colonsay.

From summer 2016, &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot; began a dedicated daily service between Mallaig and Lochboisdale, ending South Uist&#x27;s link with Oban.

<text>Michel Majerus (June 9, 1967 – November 6, 2002) was a Luxembourgish artist who combined painting with digital media in his work. 
He lived and worked in Berlin until his untimely death in a plane crash in November 2002.

==Early life and education== 
Majerus was born in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, in 1967. In 1986, Majerus began to study at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, graduating in 1992.

==Art==

In 1992, together with his fellow students from Stuttgart Nader (Ahriman), Stephan Jung, Susa Reinhardt and Wawa (Wawrzyniec) Tokarski, Majerus co-founded the artist group 3K-NH for which they used the initials of their nicknames to form a cryptic name. 3K-NH held exhibitions both in Stuttgart and Berlin. In 1993, Majerus and Jung moved to Berlin.

Painting was Majerus’s preferred medium of expression, but his creative horizon extended to many aspects of popular culture, from computer games, digital art, film, television, and pop music to trademarks and corporate logos and famous artists. His paintings&#x27; stylistic quotations included copying aspects of works by Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning and Jean-Michel Basquiat, video games and other pop-culture sources. In 1996, Majerus began his &quot;MoM Block&quot; series, comprising more than 170 canvases. MoM is an abbreviation of Modehaus Mitte, a former fashion factory in East Berlin, in which Majerus had his studio for a while.

Majerus did not limit himself to two-dimensional surfaces, but painted installations which surround the viewer. For a 1994 show at his Berlin gallery Neugerriemschneider, he asked that a road be paved inside the modest exhibition space. In 1999, at the invitation of curator Harald Szeemann, he painted the façade of the international pavilion in the Giardini of the Venice Biennale. For his largest work, &quot;if you are dead, so it is&quot; (2000), Majerus covered the interior surface of a skateboarders&#x27; half-pipe.

After moving to Los Angeles in 2000 through the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Majerus began work on a series of thirty large-format paintings incorporating digital media and animated videos. Completed in Berlin the following year, the series eventually comprised over thirty works. Nine of these works would eventually become the &quot;Pop Reloaded&quot; exhibition in Los Angeles. &quot;Pop Reloaded&quot; emphasized the visual confusion of the urban landscapes and the scale of freeway billboards and office towers. It drew on works by Cy Twombly, Mark Rothko and Gerhard Richter. The paintings were accompanied by a video of a constantly changing image of Majerus&#x27;s signature, to illustrate the idea of celebrity as a constantly changing concept.

In 2002, shortly after his return to Berlin from Los Angeles, Majerus installed a life-size photograph of a Brutalist social housing block directly in front of the East side of Brandenburg Gate; the other side was taken over by a work of Thomas Bayrle. Majerus was working on an exhibition entitled &quot;Project Space&quot; for Tate Liverpool when he died.

==Exhibitions==
Majerus&#x27;s artwork first came to international attention in 1996 with an exhibition at the Kunsthalle in Stuttgart, and then with subsequent exhibitions in Munster and Dundee (&quot;Colour Me Blind! - Painting In The Age of Computer Games And Comics&quot;, 2000). In 1996 the Kunsthalle Basel organized a mid-career museum retrospective.

In 1998, Majerus was invited to participate in Manifesta 2. He participated in the Venice Biennale in 1999, where he covered the facade of the main Italian Pavilion with a mural he designed. 

Since his death in 2002, several museums have organized exhibitions of Majerus’s work, including the Hamburger Bahnhof (2003), the Tate Liverpool (2004), the Kunsthaus Graz (2005), and the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart (2011). A posthumous exhibition of his works was featured at the Kunstmuseum of Wolfsburg (Germany) in 2003. Entitled “Painting Pictures”, the exhibition was a celebration of Majerus&#x27;s genre and was dedicated to his memory. Other painters represented in “Painting Pictures” included Takashi Murakami, Sarah Morris, Franz Ackermann, Matthew Ritchie, Torben Giehler and Erik Parker. Commencing in 2005, approximately two hundred of Majerus&#x27;s works have been displayed as the &quot;European Retrospective&quot; travelling exhibition. The exhibition was a collaboration between the Majerus family and the Galerie Neugerriemschneider, Berlin. It included works usually displayed at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, the Kunsthaus - Landesmuseum Joanneum, Graz and from private collections throughout the world (Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Great-Britain, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Portugal, USA).. 

In 2018, the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston included a painting by Majerus in a survey of art after the internet, placing it within the context of works by Jon Rafman, Cao Fei, Avery Singer, and others. His first museum survey in the United States opened at the ICA Miami in 2022. Opening twenty years after the death was the exhibition series called &quot;Michel Majerus 2022&quot; which was presented at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Neuer Berliner Kunstverein, Kunstverein in Hamburg.

==Death==
In November 2002, Majerus was killed aboard Luxair Flight 9642 while travelling from Berlin to Luxembourg.

==Influence==
In 2013, artist Thomas Bayrle played with elements from two of Majerus’s paintings to create a silk-screened wallpaper called &quot;Majerus (Smudge Tool/XXX) I&quot; (2013).
In 2020, Takashi Murakami made paintings that borrow from some of Majerus’s imagery. In 2024, The Michel Majerus Estate presented a project called &quot;Let’s Play Majerus G3&quot; based on the G3 Apple computer from Majerus’s archive that was organized by artist Cory Arcangel in cooperation with the digital art organization Rhizome.

<text>Spanglish is a 2004 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by James L. Brooks, and starring Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni, Paz Vega and Cloris Leachman.

The film was released in the United States on December 17, 2004, by Columbia Pictures. It was a box office bomb, grossing $55 million worldwide on an $80 million production budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Sandler and Vega, but criticism for the plot.

==Plot==
For Cristina Moreno&#x27;s Princeton University application essay, she tells the story of a year from her childhood and how it shaped the person she is today.

In 1992, Flor Moreno, a Mexican single mother, moved to the United States (&quot;economy class,&quot; according to Cristina’s letter) to seek a better life for her and her daughter, Cristina. They settle in a Latino community in Los Angeles, where Flor never feels the need to learn English, though Cristina does. Flor works two jobs to support her family, but as Cristina blossoms she realizes she needs to spend more time with her and gets a job as a housekeeper for John and Deborah Clasky; their children Bernice and Georgie; and Deborah&#x27;s mother, Evelyn Wright.

John is a chef and an easy-going family man. Deborah was a businesswoman who lost her job from downsizing and is now a stay-at-home mother. Evelyn is a retired singer. Deborah is uptight, neurotic and insecure. She body-shames Bernice and bullies John by demanding that he always back her up. John is torn between defending his kids&#x27; mental well-being and his domineering wife. Flor tries to build Bernice&#x27;s self-confidence with small acts of kindness, especially when Deborah is harsh.

Flor gets on well with the Claskys despite the language barrier. When Deborah rents a house for the summer, she tells Flor she expects her to live in while they are there since Flor travels by bus, and commuting from Los Angeles to Malibu is unfeasible. Faced with losing her job, Flor reluctantly agrees to bring Cristina and live with the Claskys for the summer. Cristina is instantly dazzled by the Claskys&#x27; wealthy lifestyle.

Deborah quickly becomes attached to the beautiful and personable Cristina and ignores Bernice. Flor does not approve of the attention. John unwittingly angers Flor when he offers to pay the children a set amount for each bit of sea glass they find on the beach. Cristina earnestly searches for hours and earns $650 for her efforts. Flor and John argue with Cristina as an interpreter. Flor wants to leave because of the awkward family dynamic. He convinces her to stay to Cristina&#x27;s delight, and Flor starts an English course so that she can better communicate with the Claskys.

John&#x27;s restaurant receives an enthusiastic review and he begins to feel added pressure to maintain standards. Deborah begins an affair with a real estate agent. She also secures Cristina a scholarship to Bernice&#x27;s private school, which upsets Flor, who is concerned that her daughter will either be an outcast or lose her individuality at the school. Since Cristina passionately wants to attend the school, Flor agrees but feels that Deborah is overstepping her bounds and voices her concerns to John, who tells her he empathizes as Bernice has no support from her own mother.

Deborah allows Cristina to bring her friends from the private school over for a sleepover and tells Flor it is a study session even though Cristina is expected home for a family event. The now-sober Evelyn confronts her daughter about her affair, warning her that she will lose John and ruin her life if she doesn&#x27;t stop.

Deborah confesses to John, who refuses to talk things out with her and leaves. He encounters Flor, who has arrived to quit her job and retrieve Cristina. Since Cristina is asleep with her friends, John takes Flor to his restaurant, where he cooks for her, and they admit their feelings for each other but acknowledge that they cannot have a relationship. A desperate Deborah continuously tries to contact John and blames Evelyn&#x27;s failings as a parent for the way that she is. They have a frank conversation during which they admit their faults and become closer.

The next day, Flor comes to take Cristina home and informs her that she has quit her job, which upsets Cristina. John and Flor part amicably. On the way home, Flor further upsets Cristina by telling her she cannot attend private school anymore, which leads her to have a public meltdown and to accuse Flor of ruining her life.

After she asks her mother for &quot;space,&quot; Flor, having lost patience, tells Cristina she needs to answer an important question at such a young age: &quot;Is what you want for yourself to become someone very different than me?&quot; Cristina considers that on their bus ride home before they make up and embrace. The voiceover from Cristina tells the Princeton committee that while she would be thrilled by their acceptance, she would not let it define her, as she is already her mother&#x27;s daughter.

==Production==
James L. Brooks cast Adam Sandler after seeing his more dramatic performance in &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;.

Paz Vega could not speak English when filming began and an interpreter was on set during filming so that she could communicate with the director.

Cloris Leachman replaced Anne Bancroft, who dropped out of the part after four weeks of shooting because of illness.

According to cinematographer John Seale, over two million feet of film was shot; Kodak sent him two bottles of champagne out of appreciation. This was the most footage Seale ever shot on a film, and it wasn&#x27;t surpassed until &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; in 2015.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $8 million at #3 during its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $42 million at the box office in the United States and another $12 million outside the US, which brings the worldwide total of $55 million. The film&#x27;s failure was partly due to its competition with &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;, and &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 54% based on reviews from 168 of critics, with an average rating of 6/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;Paz Vega shines, and Adam Sandler gives a performance of thoughtfulness and depth, but &quot;Spanglish&quot; is ultimately undermined by sitcommy plotting and unearned uplift.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 48% based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Its proponents claim it is a moving portrayal of the difficulty of family problems and self-identity (and perhaps to a lesser extent the difficulties and rewards of cross-cultural communication). Some critics described the film as &quot;uneven&quot;, &quot;awkward,&quot; for example when &quot;John and Flor attempt to bare their souls to one another... [with] lots of words coming out of their mouths, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a context&quot;, and &quot;The supporting performers deserve better, especially ... Cloris Leachman, who&#x27;s consigned to a demeaning role...[and] the butt of rather mean-spirited jokes.&quot;

<doc id="1274326" wikidata="Q2728668" url="?curid=1274326" title="Gulargambone">
<text>Gulargambone is a small town in the central-west plains of New South Wales, Australia, on the banks of the Castlereagh River, in Coonamble Shire. It is 382 km (and 490 km by road) north-west of Sydney. At the 2016 census, Gulargambone had a population of 400.

Its name is derived from the local Wiradjuri people&#x27;s word for &quot;Watering place of many birds&quot; or &quot;Gillahgambone&quot; for &quot;place of galahs&quot;. Gulargambone was first occupied by Europeans in the mid-19th century and gazetted as a village in 1883.

The town came to national attention in 2000, when the local government attempted to close down the post office, leading to the opening of the first community-owned post office in Australia, which has been followed by a number of other community-led initiatives. These include the improvement of the local hospital, creating a multi-purpose health centre, the opening of a new cinema and the transformation of the old cinema, Simmo&#x27;s Bazaar, into 2828, the community centre, featuring a café and a gift shop. It has also adopted a town logo, the galah. This has led to Gulargambone becoming the model for self-sufficiency for other small towns in Australia.
Gulargambone has won several awards since its revival and most importantly was awarded the 2005 NSW Tidy Towns State winner.

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of population, 400 people were in Gulargambone.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 45.0% of the population. 
* About 79.8% of people were born in Australia and 80.8% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were Anglican 27.8% and no religion 26.8%.

== Transport ==
Driving by car from Sydney to Gulargambone is 490 km and takes about seven hours. Driving by car from Dubbo to Gulargambone is 114 km and takes roughly 1.25 hr.

NSW TrainLink operates coaches between Dubbo and Lightning Ridge, which stop at Coonamble Street, Gulargambone. The coach to Lightning Ridge stops daily at 15:45. The coach to Dubbo stops at 09:00 from Tuesday to Thursday, and 12:00 from Friday to Monday.

== Sport ==
Gulargambone has a rugby union club playing in the Western Plains Rugby Union competition called the Gulargambone Galahs. The town formerly had a rugby league club of the same name, who played in the Castlereagh League and made the 2004 Grand Final.

==Gallery==
==Notable residents==

* Peter Andren – independent parliamentarian

* Alexander Henry Buckley – First World War Victoria Cross recipient

* Harry Chandler – farmer at Gulargambone, pilot navigator with the RAAF stationed first in the Middle East, then Malta and finally in England and 1944 recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross in WWII. Chandler was a crew member in a Lancaster on many tours out of England flown by RAAF pilot Frank Morris from the neighbouring town of Gilgandra, who was also a 1944 recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.

* Neil Lambell – grazier raised on &quot;Weenya&quot;, Gulargambone, 1944 recipient of Distinguished Flying Cross in WWII

<text>Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, also Hermann Schulze, (29 August 1808 – 29 April 1883) was a German politician and economist. He was responsible for the organizing of the world&#x27;s first credit unions. He was also co-founder of the German Progress Party.

==Biography==
Schulze-Delitzsch was born at Delitzsch, in Saxony. He studied law at Leipzig and Halle universities and, when thirty, he became an assessor in the court of justice at Berlin. Three years later he was appointed &quot;patrimonial-richter&quot; at Delitzsch. Entering the parliament of 1848, he joined the Left Centre. At this time, his surname was expanded from Schulze to Schulze-Delitzsch: the name of his birthplace was appended to his surname to distinguish him from other Schulzes in the Prussian National Assembly. Acting as president of the commission of inquiry into the condition of the labourers and artisans, he became impressed with the necessity of co-operation to enable the smaller trades-people to hold their own against the capitalists.

He was a member of the Second Chamber in 1848-1849; but as matters ceased to run smoothly between himself and the high legal officials, he gave up his public appointments in October 1851, and withdrew to Delitzsch. Here he devoted himself to the organization and development of co-operation in Germany, and to the foundation of &quot;Vorschussvereine&quot; (peoples&#x27; banks), of which he had established the first at Delitzsch in 1850. These developed so rapidly that Schulze-Delitzsch in 1858, in &quot;Die arbeitenden Klassen und das Assoziationswesen in Deutschland&quot;, enumerated twenty-five as already in existence. In these banks, the subscribers made small deposits, obtaining proportional credit and dividends. The management was vested in a board composed of subscribers.

In 1859 the more than 200 such banks were centrally organized under the direction of Schulze-Delitzsch. He promoted the first &quot;Genossenschaftstag&quot;, a co-operative meeting, in Weimar, and founded a central bureau of co-operative societies.

In 1861 he again entered the Prussian Chamber, and became a prominent member of the Progressist party. In 1863 he devoted the chief portion of a testimonial, amounting to $1,165,567.43 in today&#x27;s money, to the maintenance of his co-operative institutions and offices. This, however, was only to meet an exceptional outlay, for he always insisted that they must be self-supporting. The next three or four years were given to the formation of local centres, and the establishment of the Deutsche Genossenschafts-Bank, 1865.

The spread of these organizations naturally led to legislation on the subject, and this too was chiefly the work of Schulze-Delitzsch. As a member of the Chamber in 1867 he was mainly instrumental in passing the Prussian law of association, which was extended to the North German Confederation in 1868, and later to the empire. Schulze-Delitzsch also contributed to uniformity of legislation throughout the states of Germany, in 1869, by the publication of &quot;Die Gesetzgebung über die privatrechtliche Stellung der Erwerbs- und Wirthschaftsgenossenschaften&quot;, etc.

With the legislation in place, his life&#x27;s work was complete; he had placed the advantages of capital and co-operation within the reach of struggling tradesmen throughout Germany.
His remaining years were spent in consolidating this work.
He endeavored to accustom the people to rely upon their own initiative to improve their condition, and declared that the function of the state should be limited to assuring industrial and personal liberty.

Both as a writer and a member of the Reichstag his industry was incessant, and he died in harness on 29 April 1883 at Potsdam, leaving the reputation of a benefactor to the smaller tradesmen and artisans, in which light he must be regarded rather than as the founder of true co-operative principles in Germany.
At the time of his death, there were in Germany alone 3,500 co-operative banking branches with more than $100,000,000 in deposits, while the system had been extended to Austria, Italy, Belgium and Russia. His work was noteworthy enough to attain mention in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel, Anna Karenina.

<doc id="1274337" wikidata="Q69739" url="?curid=1274337" title="Calauan">
<text>Calauan (), officially the Municipality of Calauan (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. The municipality has a land area of 25.25 square miles which constitutes 3.41% of Laguna&#x27;s total area. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 87,693 people.

Situated at southeast of Manila, via Calamba and Los Baños, and from Santa Cruz. Calauan is known for the Pineapple Festival, which is celebrated every 15 May.

The patron saint of Calauan is Isidore the Laborer, the patron of farmers, known in Spanish as San Isidro Labrador.

Calauan&#x27;s population is expected to rise, as the town is being used as resettlement of informal settlers in Metro Manila through the &quot;Bayan ni Juan&quot; and the &quot;Kapit-Bisig para sa Ilog Pasig&quot; project of the ABS-CBN Foundation.

Popular destinations in the area include the Field of Faith situated in Barangay Lamot 2 and the Isdaan Floating Restaurant located along the Calamba–Pagsanjan Road.

==Etymology==
Calauan, also spelled as Calauang, got its name from the Tagalog term &quot;kalawang&quot;, which means rust. Folklore has it that during the construction of the Municipal Church, water seeped into the holes dug for its foundation, giving it a brown, rusty hue, hence the name Calauan (Kalawang).

==History==

The fertile soil of Calauan attracted the attention of Captain Juan de Salcedo, when he passed through Laguna and Tayabas (now Quezon) on his way to Bicol in 1572. Ten years later, Spanish authorities established a town government from the site of the present Poblacion, in what is now Barrio Mabacan. They called the townsite “Calauan” (Tagalog word for rust). Following in epidemic in 1703, the town was moved to its present site at the fork of three roads—now to the south-west leading to San Pablo, the other southeastward to Santa Cruz, the provincial capital, and the third going North to Manila.

At the turn of the 18th century, when Bay was designated as the provincial capital of Laguna, Calauan became a sitio of Bay. Merchants going to Southern Luzon passed through Bay and Calauan. One of them, an opulent Spaniard by the name of Iñigo, bought large tracts of land in Calauan in 1812. The landholdings of Iñigo and, later, of his heirs were so vast that many portions were still unsettled. The property was and still is, known as Hacienda Calauan. About a century later, the people of Calauan fought a “guardia civil” during the Philippine Revolution. Basilio Geiroza (better known as Cabesang Basilio) and his men routed a battalion of “guardia civiles” in a five-hour battle in Bario Cupangan (now Lamot I) in December 1897. During the subsequent Philippine-American hostilities, Calauan patriots fought numerically superior forces of General Otis in Barrio San Diego of San Pablo. With the establishment of civilian authority in Calauan in 1902, the Americans assigned Mariano Marfori as first “presidente”. Hacienda Calauan financed the construction of a hospital in 1926, and Mariano O. Marfori Jr. son of the first municipal presidente, as hospital director and the resident physician, respectively.

In 1939, by the request of President Manuel L. Quezon, Doña Margarita Roxas vda. de Soriano, granddaughter of the Spaniard, Iñigo., subdivided Hacienda Calauan and sold it to the tenants, part of what remained was converted into a rest house and a swimming pool and it became one of the tourist attractions until 1956.

In 1993, the town became the focus of media attention when Antonio Sanchez, who was serving as mayor at the time, got involved into a rape and double murder case involving two University of the Philippines Los Baños students. Sanchez and several other men were given a life sentence in March 1995.

== Geography ==
=== Geographical landmarks ===
Barangay Lamot 2 in Calauan is the site is the site of Mount Kalisungan, known for being site where retreating Japanese soldiers made their last stand in Laguna at the end of World War II. The 760 MASL mountain is sometimes also known as Mount Nagcarlan or Mount Lamot, and is a traditional during holy week hiking site among locals. It is considered a hiker&#x27;s favorite because it offers a clear view of Talim Island, Mount Tagapo, the Jalajala peninsula and Mount Sembrano to the north, the Caliraya highlands to the east, the seven lakes of San Pablo, Mount San Cristobal and Mount Banahaw to the south, and Mount Makiling to the west.

<doc id="1274338" wikidata="Q231842" url="?curid=1274338" title="Special-purpose entity">
<text>A special-purpose entity (SPE; or, in Europe and India, special-purpose vehicle/SPV; or, in some cases in each EU jurisdiction, FVC, financial vehicle corporation) is a legal entity (usually a limited company of some type or, sometimes, a limited partnership) created to fulfill narrow, specific or temporary objectives. SPEs are typically used by companies to isolate the firm from financial risk. A formal definition is &quot;The Special Purpose Entity is a fenced organization having limited predefined purposes and a legal personality&quot;.

Normally a company will transfer assets to the SPE for management or use the SPE to finance a large project thereby achieving a narrow set of goals without putting the entire firm at risk. SPEs are also commonly used in complex financings to separate different layers of equity infusion. Commonly created and registered in tax havens, SPEs allow tax avoidance strategies unavailable in the home district. Round-tripping is one such strategy. In addition, they are commonly used to own a single asset and associated permits and contract rights (such as an apartment building or a power plant), to allow for easier transfer of that asset. They are an integral part of public private partnerships common throughout Europe which rely on a project finance type structure.

A special-purpose entity may be owned by one or more other entities and certain jurisdictions may require ownership by certain parties in specific percentages. Often it is important that the SPE is not owned by the entity on whose behalf the SPE is being set up (the sponsor). For example, in the context of a loan securitization, if the SPE securitization vehicle were owned or controlled by the bank whose loans were to be secured, the SPE would be consolidated with the rest of the bank&#x27;s group for regulatory, accounting, and bankruptcy purposes, which would defeat the point of the securitization. Therefore, many SPEs are set up as &#x27;orphan&#x27; companies with their shares settled on charitable trust and with professional directors provided by an administration company to ensure that there is no connection with the sponsor.

==Uses==
Some of the reasons for creating special-purpose entities are:
* Securitization: SPEs are commonly used to securitize loans (or other receivables). For example, a bank may wish to issue a mortgage-backed security whose payments come from a pool of loans. However, to ensure that the holders of the mortgage-backed securities have the first priority right to receive payments on the loans, these loans need to be legally separated from the other obligations of the bank. This is done by creating an SPE, and then transferring the loans from the bank to the SPE.
* Risk sharing: Corporates may use SPEs to legally isolate a high risk project/asset from the parent company and to allow other investors to take a share of the risk.
* Finance: Multi-tiered SPEs allow multiple tiers of investment and debt.
* Asset transfer: Many permits required to operate certain assets (such as power plants) are either non-transferable or difficult to transfer. By having an SPE own the asset and all the permits, the SPE can be sold as a self-contained package, rather than attempting to assign over numerous permits.
* To maintain the secrecy of intellectual property: For example, when Intel and Hewlett-Packard started developing IA-64 (Itanium) processor architecture, they created a special-purpose entity which owned the intellectual technology behind the processor.
*To enable several businesses, often occupying different positions in the value chain, to contract with a public body in a public-private partnership deal.
* Financial engineering: SPEs are often used in financial engineering schemes which have, as their main goal, the avoidance of tax or the manipulation of financial statements. The Enron case is possibly the most famous example of a company using SPEs to achieve the latter goal.
* Regulatory reasons: A special-purpose entity can sometimes be set up within an orphan structure to circumvent regulatory restrictions, such as regulations relating to nationality of ownership of specific assets.
* Property investing: Some countries have different tax rates for capital gains and gains from property sales. Letting each property be owned by a separate company can mean a lower tax bill. These companies can then be sold and bought instead of the actual properties, effectively converting property sale gains into capital gains in order to pay less tax.

==Types==

===Securitization===
* A real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), used for the pooling and securitization of mortgage loans for mortgage-backed securities.
* A financial asset securitization investment trust (FASIT), a defunct entity used for securitization of any debt for asset-backed securities.
* An Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) (S110 SPV), the largest SPV in the EU for securitisation.

===Investment===
* A real estate investment trust (REIT), a tax designation for a corporate entity investing in real estate for the purpose of reducing or eliminating corporate tax.

==Establishment==
Like a company, an SPE must have promoter(s) or sponsor(s). Usually, a sponsoring corporation hives off assets or activities from the rest of the company into an SPE. This isolation of assets is important for providing comfort to investors. The assets or activities are distanced from the parent company, hence the performance of the new entity will not be affected by the ups and downs of the originating entity. The SPE will be subject to fewer risks and thus provide greater comfort to the lenders. What is important here is the distance between the sponsoring company and the SPE. In the absence of adequate distance between the sponsor and the new entity, the latter will not be an SPE but only a subsidiary company.

A good SPE should be able to stand on its feet, independent of the sponsoring company. This does not always happen in practice. One of the reasons for the collapse of the Enron SPE was that it became a vehicle for furthering the ends of the parent company in violation of the prudential norms of corporate financing and accounting.

==Abuses==
Special-purpose entities were one of the main tools used by executives at Enron, in order to hide losses and fabricate earnings, resulting in the Enron scandal of 2001. They were also used to hide losses and overstate earnings by executives at Towers Financial Corporation, which declared bankruptcy in 1994. Several executives of the company were found guilty of securities fraud, served prison sentences, and paid fines.  Evergrande  has also been accused of using off book SPE to hide debt. 

==Accounting guidance==
Under US GAAP, a number of accounting standards apply to SPEs, most notably FIN 46R that sets out the consolidation treatment of these entities. There are a number of other standards that apply to different transactions with SPEs.

Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the relevant standard is IAS 27 in connection with the interpretation of SIC12 (Consolidation—Special-Purpose Entities). For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements supersedes IAS 27 and SIC 12.

<text>In English law, a writ of scire facias (Latin, meaning literally &quot;make known&quot;) is a writ founded upon some judicial record directing the sheriff to make the record known to a specified party, and requiring the defendant to show cause why the party bringing the writ should not be able to cite that record in his own interest, or formerly why, in the case of letters patent and grants, the patent or grant should not be annulled and vacated. Largely withdrawn by 1947, its use in the administrative court remains one of the two ways in which a Royal Charter can be involuntarily revoked, the other being primary legislation in Parliament. In the United States, the writ has been abolished under federal law but may still be available in some state legal systems.

==History==
The writ of &quot;scire facias&quot; was created in 1285 during the 13th year of the reign of Edward I by the English Parliament in the Second Statute of Westminster. The writ of &quot;quo warranto&quot; was created during this same period.

==Procedure==
Proceedings &quot;in scire facias&quot; were regarded as a form of action, and the defendant could plead his defense as in an action. They were analogous to &quot;quo warranto&quot; proceedings.

In 1684, the royal charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was rescinded by a writ of &quot;scire facias&quot; for the colony&#x27;s interference with the royal prerogative in founding Harvard College and other matters.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the writ was of little practical importance. Its principal uses were to compel the appearance of corporations aggregate in revenue suits, and to enforce judgments against shareholders in companies regulated by the Companies Clauses Act 1845, or similar private acts, and against garnishees in proceedings in foreign attachment in the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Court. It was not used in Scottish law.

Proceedings by &quot;scire facias&quot; to repeal letters patent for inventions were abolished by the Patents, Designs and Trademarks Act 1883, and a petition to the court substituted.

The writ in most situations was abolished on 1 January 1948 by the Crown Proceedings Act 1947.

==U.S. significance==
The actual writ of &quot;scire facias&quot; has been suspended in the federal district courts by Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but the rule still allows for granting relief formerly available through &quot;scire facias&quot; by prosecuting a civil action. Some American legal scholars, including William Rehnquist, Saikrishna Prakash, and Steven D. Smith, have suggested that impeachment may not be the sole method to remove a federal judge from office, pointing to &quot;scire facias&quot; as an alternative.

Under the law of many states, Arkansas, Georgia, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas for example, an action &quot;in scire facias&quot; may be used to revive a dormant judgment if brought in a timely fashion. An action on debt, reciting that the dormant judgment remains unpaid, may be used for the same purpose. The defendant of the scire facias writ would generally need to prove that the debt was paid in order for the court to invalidate the writ. See O.C.G.A. § 9-12-61; Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code § 31.006.

<text>Michael Maier (; 1568–1622) was a German physician and counsellor to Rudolf II Habsburg. He was a learned alchemist, epigramist, and amateur composer.

== Early life ==
Maier was born in Rendsburg, Holstein, the son of a specialist in beadwork in embroidery named Peter Maier. He studied philosophy and medicine at Rostock (1587–1591), Frankfurt (Oder) (M.A. 1592), and Padua (1595–1596). Maier left Padua abruptly after getting involved in a fight, injuring the other party, and being arrested. He went on to the University of Basel, where he attained a doctorate in medicine in October 1596. His doctoral thesis, &quot;De epilepsia&quot; was dedicated to Matthias Carnarius. Maier then returned to Holstein to practice medicine. Around 1599, he became interested in alchemy and attempted to create an alchemical concordance, synthesizing the works of different authors. For Florian G. Calian, Maier is &quot; an alchemist who over-spiritualized his discipline.&quot;

==In the service of Rudolf II (1609-1611)==
In 1608, he went to Prague, and on 19 September 1609, he formally entered the service of Rudolf II as his physician and imperial counsellor. Ten days later, Rudolf raised him to the hereditary nobility and gave him the title of Imperial Count Palatine. He was granted a coat of arms which depicted a bird, bonded together with a frog by a golden chain. Around this time, Maier published an extremely limited print run of &quot;De Medicina Regia et vere Heroica, Coelidonia&quot; (1609), including in it his autobiography. The interest of the emperor in the occult was the reason of his high esteem for Maier. However, by April 1611, Rudolf&#x27;s political position had substantially deteriorated, and he was more or less imprisoned in his castle in Prague. Maier left the city that month. He corresponded with Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, and visited Hessen-Kassel&#x27;s brother-in-law, Count Ernst III of Holstein-Schauenburg. He was also a guest of Christoph Reinhard, Doctor of Laws and town syndic of Mühlhausen, to whom he later dedicated his book &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot;.

==In England 1611-1616==
First Maier visited the Netherlands where he stayed with Petrus Carpenterius in Rotterdam. Petrus Carpenterius had previously been the rector of a Walloon school in Norwich in 1598. From there he continued on to London arriving in 1611 or 1612. Whether he had arrived in person or not by Christmas 1611 is unknown, but he did send Christmas cards to both James I and his son Prince Henry.

He composed a wedding song for the nuptials of Frederick V of the Palatinate to Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I. He was in London on 6 November 1612, attending the funeral of Prince Henry in the retinue of Frederick of the Palatinate.

His first well-known book, &quot;Arcana arcanissima&quot;, was published in London in 1613 or 1614, originally dedicated to the head of the Royal College of Physicians at that time, William Paddy. He also personally dedicated copies to a number of notables, including the Bishop of Ely and Sir Thomas Smith of the East India Company. Other, less notable friends included Francis Anthony.

Maier returned to Germany in September 1616, settling in Frankfurt am Main. His &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot;, an alchemical emblem book, was published in 1617. Alongside images, poems, and discussion, it included fifty pieces of music in the form of fugues, the form itself being a pun on Atalanta &quot;fleeing&quot;. In 1619, Maier became the physician of Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). In 1620, he moved to Magdeburg to practice medicine, where he died at the age of 54, leaving a noteworthy quantity of unpublished works.

A devout Lutheran all his life, Michael Maier had a strong influence on Sir Isaac Newton. He was also involved in the Rosicrucian movement that appeared around this time, which afforded part of the matter of his &quot;Themis aurea&quot;.

==Influence==
The 1656 English translation of &quot;Themis Aurea&quot; appeared as &quot;Themis Aurea: The Laws of the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross&quot;, and was dedicated to Elias Ashmole. Under the initials N.L.T.S. and H.S. the dedicators justified their dedication over three pages; they are now identified as Nathaniel Hodges, and Thomas Hodges (either his father or his brother, both of that name). Ashmole, they said, began to learn seal engraving, casting in sand, and goldsmith&#x27;s work when living in Blackfriars, London, at which time he was initiated into Rosicrucian &quot;secrets&quot; by William Backhouse of Swallowfield in Berkshire. While illustrating the chain of Rosie Cross links from Michael Maier and Robert Fludd, via Backhouse to Ashmole, the details given about Ashmole&#x27;s training as a craftsman could illustrate the background of the latter&#x27;s acception in operative masonry. 

James Brown Craven, who gave detailed descriptions of the works above in his &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; (1910) of Michael Maier, also included the 1654 English translation of &quot;Lusus Serius: or, Serious Passtime. A Philosophical Discourse ...wherein Hermes or Mercury is declared King of all Worldly things&quot;. The copy from the Bodleian Library described by Craven was dedicated &quot;To the Honourable Cary Dillon, Esq., Son to Robert, late Earle of Roscommon by J. de la Salle&quot; [i.e., John Hall of Durham]. This is a fair example of the intellectual circle in which Maier&#x27;s work circulated contemporary with the association of Rosie Cross with Elias Ashmole.

<text>For Special Services, first published in 1982, was the second novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan. Cover designed by Bill Botten.

==&quot;For Special Services&quot;==
In June 1941 General William Donovan was appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt to the position of Coordinator of Information (COI), a position that later transformed into the chairmanship of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Upon request by Donovan, Ian Fleming was contacted to write a lengthy memorandum describing the structure and functions of a secret service organisation. Parts of this memorandum were later used in the official charter for the OSS, which was later dissolved after World War II in 1945. For appreciation of Fleming&#x27;s work Donovan presented Fleming with a .38 Police Positive Colt revolver with the inscription, &quot;For Special Services.&quot;

In 1944, Donovan proposed to President Roosevelt the creation of a new agency, &quot;which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies.&quot; The OSS was disbanded in 1945; accordingly, the Central Intelligence Agency; formed in 1947 is a direct descendant of the OSS.

==Plot summary==
Bond teams up with CIA agent Cedar Leiter, daughter of his old friend, Felix Leiter, to investigate one Markus Bismaquer, an ice cream tycoon who is suspected of reviving the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which was believed to have been disbanded years earlier following the death of its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, at the hands of Bond (in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;).

The British Secret Service learns that Bismaquer is an obsessive collector of rare prints, so Bond and Cedar visit the man&#x27;s huge ranch in Amarillo, Texas posing as art dealers. Their true identities are soon revealed, but not until Bond holds his own both in an impromptu (and fixed) car race arranged by Bismaquer, and in the bed of Bismaquer&#x27;s frustrated wife, Nena. Nena, who has only one breast, quickly wins Bond&#x27;s heart and his sympathy and Bond is convinced that Bismaquer is the one now being referred to as the new Blofeld.

Bond discovers that the revitalised SPECTRE plans to take over control of NORAD headquarters in order to gain control of America&#x27;s military space satellite network. NORAD personnel are supplied with ice cream contaminated with a mild narcotic which makes consumers susceptible to following orders without question. His true identity revealed, Bond is captured and brainwashed into believing he is an American general. Bond is directed to inspect NORAD and obtain from the drug-affected military personnel computer tapes relating to the satellite system. Bond was set up to be killed in the ensuing attack by SPECTRE forces on the base; however, Bismaquer, who is bisexual and had taken a liking to Bond, gave him an antidote to bring him out the hypnosis.

Via helicopter, Nena takes Bond from
NORAD to a SPECTRE house in Louisiana. Bond witnesses Bismaquer shot and killed by Nena, who is in fact, Nena Blofeld, the daughter of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, a fact she confesses to Bond. Just before firing at Bond, he throws a chair at Nena, which thrusts her through a window, falling into the crushing grip of her pet pythons. She is put out of her misery by Felix Leiter, who arrives on the scene after Cedar informed her superiors.

==Reviews==
Kingsley Amis, himself a former Bond author, was the harshest. His &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; review called the book &quot;an unrelieved disaster&quot;, Gardner &quot;not the most self-assured of writers&quot;, and said that the plot was &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;blundering&quot;. Amis said, &quot;What makes Mr Gardner&#x27;s book so hard to read is not so much its endlessly silly story as its desolateness, its lack of the slightest human interest or warmth. [...] But then to do anything like that the writer must be genuinely interested in his material.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Robin W. Winks wrote, &quot;Bond is dead, and John Gardner&#x27;s second effort to remove the nails from that coffin, though not so dreary nor so silly as the first, is nonetheless very thin gruel.&quot; Winks further said the book was &quot;exceptionally bad when read back-to-back with Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;. The book is full of one sentence paragraphs — did Fleming ever really write this way? — and obligatory &quot;who&#x27;ll sleep in the one bedroom, who on the couch&quot; scenes once calculated to titillate fourteen-year-olds.&quot;

&quot;New Statesman&quot; critic Lewis Jones dismissed it as &quot;a &quot;real&quot; airport novel, unimaginative and badly written. Bond is as dated as Biggles. Gardner&#x27;s attempts to update meet with partial success. He can manage the machines but not the people.&quot; Jones summed the book up in one word: &quot;Deadly.&quot;

Novelist Stanley Ellin, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, asserted that the novel &quot;was a dud, and for reasons having nothing to do with the author&#x27;s well-proven talent. Ian Fleming was a dreadful writer, a creator of books for grown-up boys, a practitioner of tin-eared prose...John Gardner, creator of the inimitable and delightful Boysie Oakes among other characters, is the antithesis to all this, a writer of style and wit with a sharp-eyed, acidulous and yet appreciative view of humanity and its foibles. Fleming&#x27;s shoes are simply too tight and misshapen for Mr. Gardner to wear comfortably. Fleming, however, did offer the reader one thing no imitator can possibly duplicate: total identification with and commitment to his hero and his works as the products of an uninhibited wish fulfillment.&quot; However, Ellin did find several things to admire: &quot;There are some good things among the zany proceedings: an automobile road race described to nerveracking effect; the amusing relationship between the aging Bond and the youthful Cedar Leiter; a climax where Bond is drugged into imagining he is the woolly-headed Gen. James A. Banker, U.S.A. - all pure John Gardner at his Boysie Oakes best. This still doesn&#x27;t compensate for the awkwardness of the whole project. The reader will do better to head for anything by Mr. Gardner that isn&#x27;t imitation Fleming. As pure Gardner, he is quite a writer.&quot;

Mystery novelist Reginald Hill, writing in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot;, admitted &quot;I was not pre-inclined to like John Gardner&#x27;s second James Bond adventure &quot;For Special Services&quot;, and I didn&#x27;t. Mr. Gardner is far too good a writer not to make a fair stab at the job. No mere arranger of other men&#x27;s flowers, he is of course a thriller writer of the first water. All this is done with technical skill and some panache, but in the end Bond belongs so much to the 50s and early 60s that to translate him to the 80s without making him grow up is an almost impossible task. The result is very fair escapist stuff, but time and again I found myself asking the, I hope, not impertinent question, if this man wasn&#x27;t called James Bond, how good a thriller would this be? And the answer, I&#x27;m afraid, is not half as good as what Mr Gardner is capable of giving us when he follows his own creative bent. Bring back Boysie Oakes!&quot;

&quot;People&quot; magazine complained that the novel &quot;has the stripped-down feeling of a comic strip. Fleming had fun with James Bond, but he also seemed genuinely to admire 007&#x27;s ridiculous, perfect-martini mannerisms. Gardner, while he&#x27;s a better writer than Fleming, is a cynical pro. There is no joy in his Bond.&quot;

A handful of critics liked the book despite some reservations. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; crime critic Derrick Murdoch praised Gardner&#x27;s vast research &quot;on the state-of-the-art technology affecting satellite chasers, hydraulics, automobile and monorail engineering design, weaponry, optics and pyrostatics.&quot; Murdoch also praised the novel&#x27;s final scene set &quot;in a mock-decrepit palace in the middle of the Louisiana swampland, is played out in maniacal fury, total illogic and superb idiocy to enchant the mind. In other words, John Gardner is having more fun with his rented character than he allowed himself to have in the earlier book.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said Gardner&#x27;s second Bond novel &quot;is smooth enough - but a good deal less fun than &quot;License Renewed&quot;. Comic-strippy as ever, but without the freshness and Bond-persona detail of the first resurrection.&quot;

John Waite, writing in the &quot;Nursing Mirror&quot;, said Gardner managed to write in Fleming&#x27;s style &quot;beautifully&quot;. The plot, he said, was preposterous enough, the girls exotic enough and the villains superbly Satanic.

<text>EGR-1 (Early growth response protein 1) or NGFI-A (nerve growth factor-induced protein A) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;EGR1&quot; gene.

EGR-1 is a mammalian transcription factor. It was also named Krox-24, TIS8, and ZENK. It was originally discovered in mice.

== Function ==

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the EGR family of Cys2His2-type zinc finger proteins. It is a nuclear protein and functions as a transcriptional regulator. The products of target genes it activates are required for differentiation and mitogenesis. Studies suggest this is a tumor suppressor gene.

It has a distinct pattern of expression in the brain, and its induction has been shown to be associated with neuronal activity. Several studies suggest it has a role in neuronal plasticity.

EGR-1 is an important transcription factor in memory formation. It has an essential role in brain neuron epigenetic reprogramming. EGR-1 recruits the TET1 protein that initiates a pathway of DNA demethylation. Removing DNA methylation marks allows the activation of downstream genes. EGR-1, together with TET1, is employed in programming the distribution of methylation sites on brain DNA during brain development, in learning and in long-term neuronal plasticity. EGR-1 has also been found to regulate the expression of VAMP2 (a protein important for synaptic exocytosis).

Beside its function in the nervous system, there is significant evidence that EGR-1 along with its paralog EGR-2 is induced in fibrotic diseases has key functions in fibrinogenesis and is necessary for experimentally induced fibrosis in mice.

It may also be involved in ovarian function 

== Structure ==

The DNA-binding domain of EGR-1 consists of three zinc finger domains of the Cys2His2 type.
The amino acid structure of the EGR-1 zinc finger domain is given in this table, using the single letter amino acid code. The fingers 1 to 3 are indicated by f1 - f3. The numbers are in reference to the residues (amino acids) of alpha helix (there is no zero). The residues marked &#x27;x&#x27; are not part of the zinc fingers, but rather serve to connect them all together.

Amino acid key: Alanine (Ala, A), Arginine (Arg, R), Asparagine (Asn, N), Aspartic acid (Asp, D), Cysteine (Cys, C), Glutamic acid (Glu, E), Glutamine (Gln, Q), Glycine (Gly, G), Histidine (His, H), Isoleucine (Ile, I), Leucine (Leu, L), Lysine (Lys, K), Methionine (Met, M), Phenylalanine (Phe, F), Proline (Pro, P), Serine (Ser, S), Threonine (Thr, T), Tryptophan (Trp, W), Tyrosine (Tyr, Y), Valine (Val, V)

The crystal structure of DNA bound by the zinc finger domain of EGR-1 was solved in 1991, which greatly aided early research in zinc finger DNA-binding domains.

The human EGR-1 protein contains (in its unprocessed form) 543 amino acids with a molecular weight of 57.5 kDa, and the gene is located on the chromosome 5.

== DNA binding specificity ==

EGR-1 binds the DNA sequence 5&#x27;-GCG TGG GCG-3&#x27; (and similar ones like 5&#x27;-GCG GGG GCG-3&#x27;).
The f1 position 6 binds the 5&#x27; G (the first base count from the left); the f1 position 3 to the second base (C); f1 position -1 binds to the third position (G); f2 position 6 to the fourth base (T); and so on.

== Interactions ==

EGR-1 has been shown to interact with:
* CEBPB, 
* CREB-binding protein, 
* EP300, 
* NAB1, 
* P53, and
* PSMA3

<text>A condition precedent is an event or state of affairs that is required before something else will occur. In contract law, a condition precedent is an event which must occur, unless its non-occurrence is excused, before performance under a contract becomes due, i.e., before any contractual duty exists.

In estate and trust law, it is a provision in a will or trust that prevents the vesting of a gift or bequest until something occurs or fails to occur, e.g. the attainment of a certain age or the predecease of another person. For comparison, a condition subsequent brings a duty to an end whereas a condition precedent initiates a duty.

In computing, a while loop is an instruction to check a condition precedent, then execute an action only if that check evaluates to &#x27;true&#x27;; after which execution, control then returns to the beginning of the loop and the cycle of check and conditional execution begins again. By contrast, a do while loop first executes the action, next checks a condition subsequent, then returns control to the beginning of the loop if the check evaluated to &#x27;true&#x27;. Either loop ends once a check is evaluated to &#x27;false&#x27;, after which control flow proceeds onward, now &quot;outside&quot; of the loop instruction.

<doc id="1274373" wikidata="Q483939" url="?curid=1274373" title="Yoo Young-chul">
<text>Yoo Young-chul (; born 18 April 1970) is a South Korean serial killer, sex offender, and self-confessed cannibal. After he admitted to the murders of multiple people, mostly prostitutes and wealthy old couples, the Seoul Central District Court convicted him of 20 murders, although one case was dismissed when it turned out that the crime had been committed by another serial killer, Jeong Nam-gyu. Yoo burned three and mutilated at least 11 of his victims and admitted that he ate the livers of some of his victims. He committed his crimes between September 2003 and July 2004 and was apprehended on 15 July 2004. Yoo explained his motives in front of a TV camera saying &quot;Women shouldn&#x27;t be sluts, and the rich should know what they&#x27;ve done.&quot;

==Biography==
Yoo&#x27;s maternal grandmother recalled that she had been so distressed by the hardships of life that she had thought about killing him, who was babbling, and that he had been a burden to her daughter her entire life.

Yoo had hoped to attend an arts high school, but after experiencing the humiliation of a color-blind interview, he spent his time fiddling with drawing pencils instead of paints, developing an eccentric personality.

Yoo was married in 1992 and had one son. Yoo had previously been convicted 14 times of several different crimes, and had served a total of seven years in prison prior to the convictions for murder.

==Serial murders==
From September to November 2003, Yoo killed several wealthy senior citizens by breaking into their houses and bludgeoning each of them with a hammer. To cover his tracks, he made the crime scenes look like robbery-homicides. However, no money was taken, which confused the police investigators. When the investigation started to intensify, Yoo switched to targeting female masseuses. In January 2004, Yoo was briefly arrested on a minor theft charge but was released two days later.

Starting in March 2004, Yoo called prostitutes to his residence in western Seoul and bludgeoned them after having sex with them. His victims were dismembered and mutilated to prevent their identification. They were buried in the mountains surrounding the city. Police recovered 11 bodies from the mountain behind Bongwon Temple after Yoo&#x27;s arrest.

During initial interrogations, Yoo confessed to killing 19 people. On 18 July 2004, he admitted to an additional murder: the killing of a 44-year-old male street vendor. On 19 July 2004, Yoo revised his confession, admitting to a further six murders, raising his tally to 26 individuals, although no clarification or explanation was offered at that time. The list of purported victims included several individuals who did not match his prior pattern of wealthy seniors or masseuses. Friends of two of the masseuse victims, whose bodies had been recovered, claimed they were not involved in massage therapy, meaning that Yoo could have had other, unreported victims. Although the &quot;Rainy Thursday&quot; murderer was also active from in April 2004, stabbing multiple women late at night in southwest Seoul, police were unable to link Yoo to those murders.

Several days later, Yoo also confessed to killing a young woman (a worker in a clothing store) on 6 February 2004 in Imun-dong after he suspected her of being a prostitute. Yoo had approached her for questioning by pretending to be a police officer. Approximately a month after his arrest, Yoo confessed to eating the flesh of his victims, although no evidence to prove this was offered.

===Arrest for murder===
Yoo was taken into custody on 15 July 2004 and confessed to murdering as many as 19 people initially, specifically targeting affluent senior citizens and masseuses. Yoo had raised suspicions by calling a massage parlour where several employees had recently gone missing after receiving similar phone calls, so the owner of the massage parlour, accompanied by several employees and a single police officer, went to the agreed-upon meeting place. The police officer left before Yoo arrived, and Yoo was apprehended by the employees of the massage parlor. Another police officer put handcuffs on Yoo after he was detained by the massage parlor employees.

While in custody, Yoo feigned epileptic symptoms and escaped from the police after his restraints were loosened. However, he was re-arrested 12 hours later. Yoo had attempted to escape after being arrested in 2002 for rape by faking an epileptic seizure.

The mother of the Imun-dong murder victim rushed at Yoo with an umbrella when he was brought to the prosecutor&#x27;s office later in July, screaming that her daughter would still be alive if the police had captured him earlier. A policeman kicked the mother in the chest to subdue her, claiming that his hands were occupied by holding Yoo.

===Motives===
Based on the contents of his apartment, searched after his arrest, there was some speculation that he patterned his killings after several movies, including &quot;Public Enemy&quot;, &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;, and &quot;Normal Life&quot;. Yoo later confessed to being inspired by serial killer Jeong Du-yeong, who had murdered nine wealthy people in Busan from 1999 to 2000.

On the killing of wealthy older people, prosecutors stated that he killed them out of a hostility that originated from his own childhood poverty. Regarding Yoo&#x27;s killing of women, prosecutors said his resentment stemmed from a lover who betrayed him, and he targeted women with jobs similar to those of his previous lover in a bid to retaliate. Yoo also told police he killed women because he hated them.

A psychologist who assessed Yoo concluded that he was not mentally ill, but exhibited the typical characteristics of anti-social disorder whereby a person creates their own belief system based on a rejection of moral and social norms.

===Trial and penalty===
Police admitted they had little physical evidence linking Yoo to the murders. Yoo first appeared in court on 6 September 2004, refusing to defend himself, declaring his intention to boycott the remainder of the trial and apologizing to the victims. Yoo boasted that he had no intention of stopping. When forced to return two weeks later, he lunged at the three presiding judges and recanted his confession for the February 2004 Imun-dong murder. He refused to appear at the next court session on 4 October 2004 after attempting suicide the night before. Yoo again disrupted a hearing three weeks later when he tried to attack a spectator who cursed at him, which ended with Yoo signing a statement pledging not to cause further commotion.

Prosecutors requested the death penalty, for which Yoo thanked them, and Yoo was sentenced to death on 13 December 2004 for 20 counts of murder (the count of murder for the woman in Imun-dong in February 2004 was thrown out). Prosecutors appealed the 21st murder count that the lower court had thrown out, but the lower court&#x27;s decision was upheld on 8 June 2005 by the Supreme Court.

His case shocked the public and fueled a debate over capital punishment in South Korea. Although the death penalty is still permissible under law, it has not been employed since 1997. Support for capital punishment was so small prior to Yoo&#x27;s arrest that it was on the verge of being outlawed, but it has grown since.

The Seoul Central District Court said, &quot;Murders of as many as 20 people are unprecedented in the nation and constitute very serious crimes. The death penalty is inevitable for you in light of the enormous pains inflicted on the families concerned and on society.&quot;

Yoo is detained at the Seoul Detention Center. In the early days of his sentence at Seoul Detention Center, Yoo was not required to perform hard work, when food came in he ate the biggest and tastiest part, he knocked on the doors at 10 or 11 at night to harass the guards and made them boil water for his coffee, and acted recklessly. For this reason, he was beaten up by a group of gangsters. In November 2014, it was confirmed that he had been smuggling in Japanese comics, adult picture books, and erotic novels by bribing prison guards. He was transferred to the strict-surveillance . In 2023, he was transferred back to Seoul Detention Center.

Professor Kwon Il-yong, a profiler, revealed that when he interviewed Yoo, he mentioned Richard Chase and said, &quot;Chase is mentally ill, but I am not.&quot; In the TV series &#x27;Through the Darkness&#x27;, there was a scene where they studied Richard Chase.

<text>Danny Antonucci (, ; born February 27, 1957) is a Canadian animator, director, producer, and writer. He created the Cartoon Network animated comedy series &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; as well as &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot; for MTV.

Antonucci dropped out of the Sheridan College of Visual Arts to take a job as an animator at Hanna-Barbera, and worked on a number of series: &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, and &quot;Richie Rich&quot;. He continued his career in Vancouver, working on animated shorts and television commercials at International Rocketship Limited, where he created his first solo work, &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot;. For MTV, Antonucci made a number of bumpers, his series &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, and the title sequence to animation showcase program &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot;. He went on to create &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; on Cartoon Network.

Many of his commercials for Converse, ESPN and Levi&#x27;s won a number of awards, which he keeps in a trash can by his desk. &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic.

==Early life==
Antonucci&#x27;s parents were Italian immigrants to Canada. His experiences as a child in an immigrant family deeply influenced his later work, such as &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot;.

Antonucci attended the Sheridan College of Visual Arts but quit to take a job as an animator at Canimage Production, a division of Hanna-Barbera.

==Career==
Starting his career as an animator, Antonucci worked on numerous shows, including &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, and &quot;Richie Rich&quot;.

Intending to move to Los Angeles in 1984 to find more work, Antonucci landed in Vancouver, British Columbia. He landed a job at International Rocketship Limited, animating short films and television commercials. His first effort was on the short film &quot;Hooray for Sandbox Land&quot;.

===International Rocketship Limited, foundation of a.k.a. Cartoon, and MTV work===
Antonucci&#x27;s first solo work was &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot;, produced by International Rocketship Limited, about a short-tempered butcher who swears at the meat he is cutting and gets extremely mad at the smallest mistakes. Antonucci explains the short arose out of his own frustration at having to work in children&#x27;s film for so long, and to try his hand at creating a full-fledged character on film. The short animated film screened at several film festivals, including Spike and Mike&#x27;s Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in the United States.

The &#x27;Lupo&#x27; character was eventually licensed by the Converse athletic shoe company. This led to additional work, including animated commercials for Levi Strauss &amp; Co. ESPN, Converse and MTV. He also originally created a mascot for Cartoon Network, known as the jester, as well as the mascot&#x27;s bumpers.

On April 1, 1994, Antonucci started an animation company named a.k.a. Cartoon, which produced the short-lived MTV series &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, which began airing in 1994 and ended its run in 1995. Antonucci went on to work on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot; show in 1997, directing, writing and providing voices, in addition to being responsible for the title sequence of the show.

===&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot;===

Feeling confined to &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;edgy&quot; work, such as his series &quot;The Brothers Grunt&quot;, Antonucci decided to produce an animated children&#x27;s television show again with his company a.k.a. Cartoon. However, he resolved to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the cartoon styles from the 1940s to the 1970s. Antonucci spent months designing the show, before trying to sell it to Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon told him that they would take the show, if they also obtained creative control. Antonucci refused to give it, and instead took the show to Cartoon Network. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission the show, after they agreed to let Antonucci go in his own direction.

Antonucci is a strong advocate of hand-drawn animation. The wobbling animation in &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; is an homage to the hand-drawn cartoons with a style that harkens back to cartoons of the 1940s to the 1970s. To give the impression of movement, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; uses shimmering character outlines similar to &quot;Squigglevision&quot;. The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in &quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot;, but are still visible, and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.

According to Antonucci, the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons. The Eds also possess personality traits similar to The Three Stooges, whose money-making schemes and antics also invariably backfire. The cul-de-sac children and the Kanker Sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, stating that he &quot;thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own&quot; and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first-generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.

&quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; is the only a.k.a. Cartoon show to have a movie based on the animated television series. The series&#x27; finale movie, &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.

===WildBrain and upcoming series===
While Antonucci was working on &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&#x27;s Big Picture Show&quot;, it was announced on September 4, 2008 that he signed to WildBrain; Antonucci stated that he was &quot;already kicking around three different ideas for his first WildBrain project&quot;. On June 11, 2013, US animator Joe Murray posted a short interview with Antonucci for his class on his website, and on the end wrote: &quot;He&#x27;s currently working on a new series, so rock on.&quot; In November 2020, Antonucci confirmed a series based on &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; was in development for release on Netflix which got canceled due to creative differences between Antonucci and Netflix.

==Awards and nominations==
Antonucci&#x27;s first solo work &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; was a successful short and is considered to be a cult classic. Eric Fogel, creator of &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, stated that &quot;Lupo the Butcher&quot; &quot;opened [his] eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and inspired [him] to pursue a career path that was a bit more... twisted&quot;. Throughout his career, Antonucci received a number of awards. He worked on a number of award-winning commercials for Converse, ESPN and Levi&#x27;s. In 1998, for his work on &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot;, Antonucci received a National Cartoonists Society Division Award for Television Animation. &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; received various awards and nominations; for his work on the series, he won a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation in 1999 and a Leo Award for Best Director in an Animated Production or Series in 2000. With an almost 11-year run, it remains the longest running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date. It was also Cartoon Network&#x27;s most popular series among boys ages 2–11. Bob Higgins, head of WildBrain, considered &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; to be a &quot;landmark in animation&quot;. Joe Murray, known for creating the animated series &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; and &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot;, called Antonucci &quot;one of the founders and mainstays of modern animation&quot;.

==Personal life==
Antonucci has two children named Tex and Marlowe who were named after animator Tex Avery and the fictional character Philip Marlowe respectively.

<doc id="1274379" wikidata="Q5159243" url="?curid=1274379" title="Condition subsequent">
<text>A condition subsequent is a philosophical and legal term referring to a defined event which terminates a proposition or a contractual obligation. In contrast to a condition precedent, a condition subsequent brings the event (or obligation) to an end, rather than being necessary for to the event or obligation to occur.
In law, a condition subsequent is an event, or state of affairs, whose occurrence is automatically construed to terminate the obligation of one party to the other. One example is that, if a man agreed to pay a barber to shave his beard, the barber then failing to do so would terminate the man&#x27;s obligation to pay. An exit clause is a form of condition subsequent that can serve as a form of insurance for the party to whom it applies.

In contract law, a contract may be frustrated on the occurrence of a condition subsequent: in a contract to provide a music hall for a musical performance, the burning down of the music hall may frustrate the contract and automatically bring it to an end. &quot;Taylor v Caldwell&quot; 3 B. &amp; S. 826, 122 Eng. Rep. 309 (1863) In a loan agreement, a condition subsequent is one which the borrower is required to satisfy within a set time period following their acquisition of the funds. Failure to do so typically triggers a default. Conditions subsequent can be explicitly stated in the language of a contract, or implied by the nature of an agreement. Implicit conditions subsequent often apply in the case of retail transactions, like point of sale purchases.

In property law, a condition subsequent is an event which terminates a party&#x27;s interest in a property. When land rights are subject to a condition subsequent, this creates a defeasible fee called a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

In such a fee, the future interest is called a &quot;right of reentry&quot; or &quot;right of entry.&quot;
There, the fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition, but if the specified future event occurs, the grantor has a right to retake his property (as opposed to it reverting to him automatically). Again, the right of entry is not automatic, but rather must be exercised to terminate the fee simple subject to condition subsequent. To exercise right of entry, the holder must take substantial steps to recover possession and title, for example, by filing a lawsuit.

One of the formulations used to create a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and a right of entry is &quot;to A, but if A sells alcohol on the land, then grantor has the right of reentry.&quot;

Common uses include language such as &quot;may&quot;, &quot;but if&quot;, &quot;however&quot;, or &quot;provided that...&quot;

Some examples of conditions subsequent often requested by parties to a contract include bankruptcy, divorce, or relocation to a different area; a contract with such conditions will free that party from obligation to carry out its terms if some unforeseen event causes the situation to change dramatically. Generally, the defendant has the burden of proof to demonstrate that conditions subsequent were met.

==Compared to condition precedent==
In comparison, a condition subsequent brings a duty to an end, whereas a condition precedent initiates a duty.

<text>: &quot;For the New Zealand politician see&quot; Tom Seddon

Thomas Seddon (28 August 1821 in London – 23 November 1856 in Cairo) was an English landscape painter associated with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, who painted colourful and highly detailed scenes of Brittany, Egypt, and Jerusalem.

==Life==

Seddon was born on 28 August 1821 in Aldersgate Street in the City of London, the son of a well-known cabinet-maker of the same name. He was educated at a school conducted on the Pestalozzian system by the Rev. Joseph Barron at Stanmore, and then worked for his father until 1841, when he was sent to Paris to study ornamental art.

He then returned to work in the family business. Although Seddon had already decided to become a painter, he continued to study design conscientiously, attending Thomas Leverton Donaldson&#x27;s lectures on architecture and studying works in the British Museum. In 1848 his design for an ornamental sideboard won him a silver medal from the Society of Arts. Meanwhile, he took lessons at Charles Lucy&#x27;s drawing school in Camden Town, and attended life classes held by the Artists&#x27; Society at Clipstone Street. In the summer of 1849, he went to North Wales, visiting Betws-y-Coed, then a popular destination for artists, where he made his first serious attempts at landscape painting. The next year he went to Barbizon in the forest of Fontainbleau, where he made some studies in oil.

By the beginning of 1848, Seddon had come into contact with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, having met Ford Madox Brown, and during 1850 he worked on a copy of &quot;Chaucer at the Court of Edward III&quot; in Brown&#x27;s studio. Around this time he was also involved in the setting up of the North London School of Drawing and Modelling, an art school for working men in Camden Town. At the end of 1850 he suffered a severe attack of rheumatic fever, during which—apparently close to death—he was reconciled with organised religion, having stopped attending church some years before; according to his brother&#x27;s memoir &quot;those that knew him best regard[ed] that sickness as the turning point in his spiritual history, and the commencement of his practical Christianity.&quot; Just after this illness, Seddon left his father&#x27;s business, which was about to be relocated to Gray&#x27;s Inn Road. He moved to rooms in Percy Street, off Tottenham Court Road, where he completed a painting of figure subject, &quot;Penelope&quot;, which was his first work to be shown at the Royal Academy. He visited Wales again in late 1851 and the following summer went to Dinan in Brittany where his sisters were staying; a landscape painted there was shown at the Royal Academy the next year.

Seddon spent much of the early part of 1853 preparing for a journey to Egypt in the company of one of the Brotherhood&#x27;s founders, William Holman Hunt. In June he went to Dinan again, where he painted a large and elaborate landscape showing the ruined monastery of Léhon. Seddon left France for Egypt in November, arriving in Alexandria on 6 December, and moved on to Cairo, Hunt not having yet arrived.

Seddon and Hunt set up camp near the Pyramids, with another Englishman called Nicholson, who was terminally ill, and died there. Then, in a change of plan, the two artists decided to move on to Jerusalem, sailing from the mouth of the Nile in late May. On arrival Seddon left Hunt in the city, and pitched a tent on a hill looking up the valley of Jehosophat, with a view of the biblical sites of the Garden of Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives, from where he painted much of the highly finished landscape &quot;Jerusalem and the Valley of Jehoshaphat from the Hill of Evil Counsel&quot;. He left the city for France in October 1854.

Although the &quot;Valley of Jehosphat&quot; was exhibited with the subtitle &quot;Painted on the Spot during the Summer and Autumn Months&quot;, Seddon continued to work on it in Dinan, along with another oil painting and two watercolours also begun in Jerusalem. He finally finished it, with some help from Hunt, following his return to London in January 1855 and showed it for the first time at an exhibition in his studio in Berners Street in March of the same year. His Eastern subjects were exhibited again the following year in Conduit Street.

In October 1856 Seddon visited Cairo again, but died of dysentery there on 23 November. In 1857 his works were exhibited in the gallery of the Society of Arts, and &quot;Jerusalem and the Valley of Jehoshaphat&quot;, was purchased by subscription and presented to the National Gallery. John Ruskin pronounced Seddon&#x27;s views of Egypt and Palestine to be &quot;the first landscapes uniting perfect artistical skill with topographical accuracy; being directed, with stern self-restraint, to no other purpose than that of giving to persons who cannot travel trustworthy knowledge of the scenes which ought to be most interesting to them&quot;.

A memoir of Seddon, by his brother, architect John Pollard Seddon, was published in 1859.

<text>The Ligbi (or Ligby) people speak a Mande language in Ghana, in the north-west corner of the Brong-Ahafo Region. Ligbi is spoken by approximately 10,000 speakers (1988 GILLBT/SIL). It is fairly closely related to Jula, Vai and Kono. A small population of Ligbi speakers (around 4,000) is reported to live in Ivory Coast (Vanderaa 1991). Ligbi is also known as Wela (Hwela) or Numu. The latter of these refers to a subsection of the Ligbi people; is Dyula for &#x27;blacksmith&#x27;. (See blacksmiths of western Africa.)

The Ligbi area in Ghana is bordered to the west by Nafaanra, the Senufo language of the Nafana people. The Ligbi people have come to the area of Begho (Bighu), an ancient trading town on the Tain river in Ghana, in the early 17th century before the Nafana. 
Ligbi has seven oral and seven nasal vowels. It is a tonal language with two level tones, High and Low. Syllables are of the form (C1)V(C2) or N (a syllabic nasal), where CV is the most common syllable type. C1 can be any of the consonants, whereas the optional C2 slot can have only nasals homorganic with the following consonants, e.g., &quot;nine houses,&quot; &quot;ten houses.&quot; V (a vowel) alone occurs word-initial only in personal pronouns, some loan words, and names, e.g., &quot;we have come.&quot;

<text>The Pontiac Parisienne is a full-size rear-wheel drive vehicle that was sold by Pontiac on the GM B platform in Canada from 1958 to 1986 and in the United States from 1983 to 1986. Right-hand drive models were locally assembled in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa until 1969. For most of its run, the Canadian Parisienne was nearly mechanically identical to the American Chevrolet Impala or Chevrolet Caprice. The Parisienne wagon continued under the Safari nameplate until 1989. &quot;Parisienne&quot; or &quot;La Parisienne&quot; means a grammatically female person or thing from Paris, France.

==Differences from US Pontiacs==

The Parisienne entered the production lineup as a sub-series within the Laurentian line in the 1958 model year. Parisienne became a separate model in 1959.

For most of its life, the Parisienne was the Canadian nameplate for the top-of-the-line model sold in GM of Canada&#x27;s Pontiac showrooms. Parisiennes were distinct from other Canadian Pontiac models by their standard features: the luxuriousness of upholstery fabrics; standard equipment such as courtesy interior and trunk lights; bright trim mouldings in the interior; distinct exterior accent chrome pieces; and availability of two- and four-door hardtops and convertibles.

In particular, Canadian &quot;full size&quot; Pontiacs were actually closely related to Chevrolets, making use of the economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain, though with the American Pontiac-styled exterior body panels (They weren&#x27;t the same as U.S. Pontiac panels since they had to fit the shorter-wheelbase 119-inch Chevrolet &quot;X&quot; frame. U.S. Pontiacs used a full perimeter frame.) and interior instrument panels. As Chevrolets under the skin, Canadian Pontiacs including the Parisienne used the same engines and transmissions as full-size Chevys, including the 230 and 250 cubic inch 6 cylinder and 283, 307, 327, 350, 396, 400, 409, 427 and 454 cu inch V8s. These engines were mated to the same transmissions as Chevrolet, including 3 and 4 speed manual and the 2 speed Powerglide and later the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmissions.

The first Parisienne, offered for the 1958 model year, was a super deluxe &quot;halo&quot; model in the Laurentian line, much like Chevrolet&#x27;s Bel Air Impala of the same year. Chevrolet&#x27;s Ramjet fuel injection system, introduced in 1957 in the U.S., was a Parisienne option as well. It was marketed as the &quot;Power Chief&quot; option, but it was identical to Chevy&#x27;s Ramjet. Also available for the first year Parisienne was Chevrolet&#x27;s Turboglide automatic transmission.

Built in the same GM of Canada assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, Pontiacs had parallel model lineups as &quot;full size&quot; Chevrolets: the Pontiac &quot;Strato Chief&quot; had similar trim level and upholstery as Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;Biscayne&quot;, the &quot;Laurentian&quot; matched the trim level of the Chevrolet &quot;Bel Air&quot; and while the Parisienne offered similar amenities as Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;Impala&quot;, the Pontiac version had unique and more costly upholstery fabrics, and beginning in 1964 the &quot;Custom Sport&quot; (later rebadged the &quot;2+2&quot;) two-door hardtop and convertible model line was in lock-step with Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;Super Sport&quot;. Finally, starting in 1966 Pontiac offered the &quot;Grande Parisienne&quot;, in two-door and four-door hardtop models parallel to Chevrolet&#x27;s luxurious &quot;Caprice,&quot; although Grande Parisiennes through 1967 used the styling of the US-market Grand Prix. Also for 1967 and 1968 a Grande Parisienne wagon was offered. Through most of its life, the Parisienne resembled the US-market Bonneville despite its Chevrolet underpinnings.

In contrast, the Pontiac Motor Division of GM in the US manufactured models with drivetrains, chassis and equipment unique from the other GM stablemates—Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Through much of the 1950s through 1970s, the American Pontiac model lineup included the &quot;Catalina&quot;, &quot;Ventura&quot;, &quot;Executive&quot;, &quot;Star Chief&quot; and as the top of the line model, the &quot;Bonneville&quot;. Additionally, unique to the US lineup until 1969 was the &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, a distinct 2-door hardtop model with unique styling features and both luxury and &quot;sporty&quot; accoutrements such high output V8s, bucket seats, tachometers and flashy trim pieces.

The mix of Pontiac exterior styling on an economical Chevrolet chassis and drivetrain at a price point marginally higher than Chevrolet, was a huge marketing success for GM of Canada. For decades, full-size Pontiacs took third place behind Chevrolet and Ford in sales, typically 70,000 plus units annually. In contrast, heavier and bulkier American Pontiacs, with far higher sticker prices and higher operating costs due to large-displacement V8s requiring high-octane fuel, would have little appeal in the Canadian marketplace for a number of reasons: a population base one tenth the size of the U.S., a less stratified society with lower disposable incomes, more prudent spending and savings sensibilities, and higher taxes and gasoline prices. On the manufacturing side, maintaining unique part availability for a low-sales vehicle along with import-export tariffs and barriers between the U.S. and Canada would make the sale of American Pontiacs unprofitable in Canada.

In 1977, GM downsized its full-sized lineup. Pontiac continued with the Catalina and Bonneville nameplates it had used since 1973, but the cars failed to manage the sales volume of their divisional siblings and were dropped completely in 1981. However, the Bonneville name was then simply switched to the smaller G-body Pontiac (the cousin of the Chevrolet Malibu, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Buick Regal) for 1982. Previously, those cars had been sold as the LeMans, but sales were poor and GM decided to swap nameplates on the grounds that Bonneville carried higher name recognition among customers.

With the recession of 1979–82 lifting and gas prices beginning to drop, sales of larger cars began to pick up and so Pontiac dealers began demanding the return of the full-sized B-body line. However, the U.S. assembly plants used for the Catalina/Bonneville had been converted over to other uses, thus GM had to now source Pontiac B-bodies from Canada, where the line had not been discontinued.

Even though the re-sized Bonneville was also sold in Canada, the full-size Parisienne continued for 1982, although its distinct Pontiac front- and rear-end treatments and interiors were largely replaced with Chevrolet components (described in detail below). At the request of US Pontiac dealerships who still wanted a full-size rear wheel drive car to replace the lost U.S. market share and gain back traditional Pontiac customers who longed for a large rear wheel drive car, the Parisienne was imported from Oshawa, Ontario, Canada and sold in the United States beginning in the 1983 model year, retaining the model name &quot;Parisienne&quot; and specs from the Canadian original. Externally, it was a rebadged Chevrolet Impala (1983-84 models (and 1982 in Canada) had the Impala rear taillight panel fitted with Pontiac-spec taillight lenses, whereas the nose was borrowed from the Chevrolet Caprice fitted with a Pontiac grille). The 1985 and 1986 models resumed use of the rear-end styling from the 1980 to 1981 Bonneville. Two Parisienne ranges were sold: a base model (similar to the former Catalina and the then-current Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale) in four-door sedan and Safari station wagon form, and a more-luxurious Brougham four-door sedan (with velour upholstery that featured loose-pillow fitted seats). The two-door version of the 1977-81 B-bodies did not return to the US market, although it persisted in Canada through 1983.

==First generation: 1959-60==

==Second generation: 1961–1964==


==Third generation: 1965–1970==

In 1965 Pontiac Parisienne grille appeared as the Bonneville grille, with the exception of the Custom Sport grille which was taken from US 1965 Pontiac Grand Prix. Although the powertrain offerings paralleled the Chevrolet full size powertrain lineup, 1965 was an exception. The Canadian full size Pontiacs never came with a 396 in 1965 but continued with the 409 as an optional engine until the 1966 model year was introduced. 
1967 brought new styling including new grilles. There were also new safety features, such as a collapsible steering column and dual braking system.

The 1968 model was the last model for right-hand-drive assembly in those markets as supplied by the Oshawa plant, following General Motors in the United States decision to cease all RHD exports in 1968. Nevertheless, the 1968 model continued to be locally assembled for a further year in Australia and New Zealand, and for two more years in South Africa.


==Fourth generation: 1971–1976==

For 1971, GM&#x27;s new &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; bodies were the largest ever produced. During this generation in the Parisienne, the 350 2 bbl Chevrolet engine was now the standard powerplant with a 4 bbl version and a 400 2 bbl being optional. However, the larger Chevrolet 454 engine was replaced for the first time with the same larger powerplants as U.S. market Pontiacs. Thus, the Pontiac 400 &amp; 455 cubic-inch V8 were now offered as options on selected full size models.

The Grande Parisienne name was no longer used after 1969 and the Parisienne became the Parisienne Brougham in 1971, which was virtually the same car as the American Catalina and its 123.5 inch wheelbase. The Canadian Laurentian model continued.

In 1971 the Grand Ville and Bonneville models were introduced to Canada, with their 126-inch wheelbase, along with the Catalina model.

The Grand Ville had a front bench seat with a center armrest or an optional 60/40 divided seat with armrest. The Bonneville and Parisienne Brougham had a front bench seat without an armrest.

Starting with the 1972 model year, all V8-powered Canadian Pontiacs got the Turbo Hydra-Matic as the standard transmission. Six cylinder models (Laurentian only) got a 3-speed manual as standard.

In 1973 all full-size Pontiac models were given a 124-inch wheelbase before being downsized for the 1977 model year.

While the Bonneville remained for 1976, 1975 was the last year for the Grand Ville in both the U.S. and Canada, with the Bonneville Brougham replacing the Grand Ville in 1976.


==Fifth generation: 1977–1986==
For 1977 model year, the full-sized GM cars (B-platform and C-platform) were greatly downsized, losing hundreds of pounds in weight and several inches in length while retaining the similar amount of interior space. Smaller, lighter bodies allowed the smaller engines, which led to the lower fuel consumption.

The 1977–1981 Parisienne shared the same front end and taillight design with Bonnevilles sold in the United States. When the full-size GM cars were revised in 1980, Parisienne sedan and coupe gained the formal roof with near-vertical rear windscreen. The revised grille became narrower in width, and the front turn signal indicators were moved from the bumpers to the positions between main and high beam headlights. The cornering lamp was moved higher from the lower chrome trim to the body. The taillights were revised to be more vertical and had deeper inserts between the chrome trims.

When General Motors revised the G-platform in 1982, Pontiac in the United States renamed LeMans as Bonneville Model G, moving the nameplate down from the full-size to mid-size car. The full-size B-platform car was renamed as Parisienne, making it the first time that Parisienne was sold in the United States.

For 1982, Parisienne was revised to base on Chevrolet Caprice with different grille insert and taillight trim. For both Canadian and American markets, Parisienne was again available as sedan, coupe, and station wagon along with both V6 and V8 engines from the various divisions. Parisienne remained in production until 1986 with minor annual trim revisions.

Of all models based on B-platform (1977–1996), Parisienne and Bonneville (until its transfer to G-platform in 1982), were only one to have detachable rear wheel skirts. The wheel skirts were eliminated for 1982, only to return again for 1985 as to differentiate Parisienne further from Caprice. With that differentiation the Parisienne returned to using the rear quarter panels, decklid and wraparound taillamps previously used on the 1980–81 Bonneville. Wheel skirts were never fitted to the station wagon models. 


==Exports==
The Oshawa plant was responsible for export of Chevrolet and Pontiac vehicles to right-hand-drive (RHD) markets and Pontiac Parisiennes and Laurentians were exported in Knock-down kit form to those markets until 1968.

The &#x27;61-&#x27;64 models had the &#x27;61 Pontiac dash reversed for RHD (also shared with Chevrolets) and &#x27;65 to &#x27;68 used an adapted version of the 1965 Chevrolet Impala dash panel, again shared with Chevrolets.

Oshawa plant assembly of RHD Chevrolets and Pontiacs ceased after 1968 at the behest of General Motors in the United States.

===Australia===
Parisiennes and Laurentians were shipped to Australia and assembled at GM&#x27;s Holden plant in Dandenong, Victoria, using some domestic parts such as seats, heaters, opposing windscreen wipers and 2 speed ventilation systems. The Laurentian was built until 1963 and the Parisienne until 1968. Australian cars were assembled from Complete Knock-down (CKD) kits (welded and painted locally.) As red rear turn signals were illegal in Australia, Australian cars had to have amber lenses drilled into the rear bumper or trunk lid (depending on the model) with the turn signals rewired to flash through them. The 1968 model was the last RHD model to be exported internationally, hence all Australian 1969 cars are 1968 models assembled for a further year.

===New Zealand===
Canadian Parisiennes, Laurentians, and Impalas were sent as Semi Knock-down (SKD) kit cars (completed body locally assembled to frame) to New Zealand and assembled at GM New Zealand&#x27;s Petone plant until 1969. As with Australia, New Zealand 1969 models are 1968 models assembled for one more year.

===Europe===
Pontiac &quot;kit cars&quot; were also assembled by G.M. Continental, in Antwerp, Belgium

===South Africa===
Canadian Pontiacs were assembled by General Motors South Africa in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The last 1968 Parisienne models were assembled in South Africa well into 1970.

===Philippines===
The 3rd Generation Pontiac Parisienne was also built at the Philippines by Yutivo Sons Hardware Corporation.

==Successor==
The Parisienne still sold well when GM decided to drop the line after the 1986 model year with no replacement. A front wheel drive model with the Bonneville name had similar dimensions versus the 1982 mid-size model, classifying the car as a full-size by the EPA; however, the wagon model (known just as &quot;Safari&quot;) continued until 1989.

While the Parisienne name was retired in 1986, big Pontiac fans got a completely new, but full-sized, Bonneville for 1987. This car featured front-wheel drive and a V6 as standard, in line with the contemporary Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile big models. Rear-wheel drive sedans returned to the Pontiac lineup with the Holden-sourced Pontiac G8 in 2008.

GM did retain the Parisienne name into the late 80&#x27;s on exports to the Middle East which were re-badged Caprices.
