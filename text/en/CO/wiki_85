<text>Dental sealants (also termed pit and fissure sealants, or simply fissure sealants) are a dental treatment intended to prevent tooth decay. Teeth have recesses on their biting surfaces; the back teeth have fissures (grooves) and some front teeth have cingulum pits. It is these pits and fissures that are most vulnerable to tooth decay because food and bacteria stick in them and because they are hard-to-clean areas. Dental sealants are materials placed in these pits and fissures to fill them in, creating a smooth surface which is easy to clean. Dental sealants are mainly used in children who are at higher risk of tooth decay, and are usually placed as soon as the adult molar teeth come through.

==Background==

Dental caries is an upset of the balance between loss and gain of minerals from a tooth surface. The loss of minerals from the teeth occurs from the bacteria within the mouth, fermenting foods and producing acids, whereas the tooth gains minerals from our saliva and fluoride that is present within the mouth. When this balance is skewed due to frequent intake of fermentable carbohydrates, poor oral hygiene, and lack of fluoride consumption, there is a continuous loss and little gain of minerals over a long period of time, which can ultimately cause what is known as tooth decay.

Dental sealants are a preventive treatment that is part of the minimal intervention dentistry approach to dental care. These sealants are a plastic material placed in the pits and fissures (the recesses on the chewing surfaces) of primary (baby) or permanent (adult) molar and premolar teeth at the back of the mouth. These molar teeth are considered the most susceptible teeth to dental caries due to the anatomy of the chewing surfaces of these teeth, which inhibits protection from saliva and fluoride and instead favours plaque accumulation. This approach facilitates prevention and early intervention, in order to prevent or stop the dental caries process before it reaches the ends stage of the disease, which is also known as the &quot;hole&quot; or cavitation of a tooth. Once the tooth is cavitated, it requires a dental restoration in order to repair the damage, which emphasizes the importance of prevention in preserving teeth for a lifetime of chewing.

Preventing tooth decay from the pits and fissures of the teeth is achieved by dental sealants providing a physical barricade to protect natural tooth surfaces and grooves, inhibiting build-up of bacteria and food trapped within such fissures and grooves. Dental sealants also provide a smooth surface that is easily accessible for both the natural protective factor, saliva and the toothbrush bristles when cleaning the teeth. As dental sealants are clear or white, they are only visible upon close inspection.

Multiple oral health care professionals including dentists, dental therapists, dental hygienists, oral health therapists and dental assistants (in some states in the US) are able to apply dental sealants to teeth.

==History==
There have been many attempts made within past decades to prevent the development of caries, in particular occlusal caries as it was once generally accepted that pits and fissures of teeth would become infected with bacteria within 10 years of erupting into the mouth. G.V. Black, the creator of modern dentistry, informed that more than 40% of caries incidences in permanent teeth occurred in pits and fissures due to being able to retain food and plaque.

One of the first attempts to prevent occlusal caries occurred as early as 1905 by Willoughby D. Miller. Miller, a pioneer of dentistry, was applying silver nitrate to surfaces of teeth, chemically treating the biofilm with its antibacterial functions against both Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces naeslundii, which are both carious pathogens. Silver nitrate, which was also being practiced by H. Klein and J.W. Knutson in the 1940s, was being used in attempt to prevent and arrest occlusal caries.

In 1921, T.P. Hyatt, a pioneer researcher, was the first person to recommend prophylactic odontotomy (preventive operation). This procedure involved creating Class 1 cavity preps of teeth that were considered at risk of developing occlusal caries, which included all pits and fissures. The widening of the pits and fissures were then filled with amalgam.

C.F Bödecker, a dentist and researcher, also made attempts to prevent occlusal caries. Initially, in 1926 Bödecker would use a large round bur to smooth out the fissures. 1929, Bödecker attempted to prevent occlusal caries by cleaning the pit and fissures with an explorer and then sealing the pits and fissures with dental cement, such as oxyphosphate cement. Bödecker then later became an advocator for prophylactic odontotomy procedures (preventive operations).

It was in 1955, that M.G. Buonocore gave insight to the benefits of etching enamel with phosphoric acid. His studies demonstrated that resin could be bonded to enamel through acid etching, increasing adhesion whilst also creating an improved marginal integrity of resin restorative material. It was this bonding system that led to the future successful creation of fissure sealants.

In 1966, E.I. Cueto created the first sealant material, which was methyl cyanoacrylate. However, this material was susceptible to bacterial breakdown over time, therefore was not an acceptable sealing material. Bunonocore made further advances in 1970 by developing bisphenol-a glycidyl dimethacrylate, which is a viscous resin commonly known as BIS-GMA. This material was used as the basis for many resin-based sealant/composite material developments in dentistry, as it is resistant to bacterial breakdown and forms a steady bond with etched enamel.

In 1974, glass ionomer cement fissure seals (GIC) were introduced by J.W. McLean and A.D. Wilson.

==Modern sealant materials==

Modern dental sealants generally are either resin based or glass ionomer based.

=== Resin based sealants ===
It is customary to refer to the development of resin based sealants in generations:

# First generation: set with UV curing. They are no longer marketed. 
# Second generation: chemical-curing (autopolymerized).
# Third generation: visible light-cured.
# Fourth generation: contain fluoride.

As part of the wider debate over the safety of bisphenol A (BPA), concerns have been raised over the use of resin based sealants. BPA is a xenoestrogen, i.e. it mimics the relative bioactivity of estrogen, a female sex hormone. Pure BPA is rarely present in dental sealants, however they may contain BPA derivatives. There is very little research about the potential estrogen-like effects of BPA derivatives. A transient presence of BPA in saliva has been reported immediately following placement of some resin based sealants. The longest duration of salivary BPA was 3 hours after placement, so there is little risk of chronic low-dose BPA exposure. The currently available evidence suggests that there is no risk of estrogen-like side effects with resin based sealants. Several national dental organizations have published position statements regarding the safety of resin based dental materials, e.g. the American Dental Association, the Australian Dental Association, the British Dental Association, and the Canadian Dental Association.

===Glass ionomer sealants===
GIC materials bond both to enamel and dentine after being cleaned with polyacrylic acid conditioner. Some other advantages GICs have is that they contain fluoride and are less moisture sensitive, with suggestions being made that despite having poor retention, they may prevent occlusal caries even after the sealant has fallen out due to their ability to release fluoride.

There is evidence that GIC sealant that were exposed to thermo-light curing with a LED polymerization unit (60 s) had comparable sealing ability and superior sealing characteristics compared to the conventional resin-based sealant.

=== Resin based sealants versus glass ionomer sealants ===
It was shown that GIC materials were more effective in prevention of development of caries despite the higher non-successful rate compared to resin based sealants. This may be accounted for due to the fluoride-releasing property of GIC which increases salivary fluoride level that may aid in preventing dental caries.

Resin-based sealants are normally the preferred choice of material for denture sealants. GIC material may be used as a provisional protective material when there are concerns regarding adequate moisture control.

===Effectiveness===
Dental sealants are accepted as an effective preventive method for cavities and as long as the sealant remains adhered to the tooth, cavities can be prevented. It is for this reason that sealant success is now measured by the length of time a sealant remains on the tooth, rather than the decay experienced in sealed and unsealed teeth. The ability of a pit and fissure sealant to prevent dental caries is highly dependent on its ability to retain on the tooth surface.

It has been demonstrated that the use of adhesive systems before applying dental sealants improves retention. Traditional retention of a sealant on tooth surface is through acid etching.

The most common reason for sealant failure is salivary contamination during sealing placement. Other factors include clinician inexperience, lack of client co-operation, and less effective sealant material used.

Sealants may be applied in conjunction with fluoride varnish as a preventive method which is shown to be more successful (low certainty evidence) than fluoride varnish alone.

Various factors can help contribute to the retention of fissure sealants. These include:
* Isolation of teeth from saliva
* Not placing sealants on partially erupted teeth as there is gingival tissue on the crown
* Good operator techniques
* Preparation of the fissure by cleaning out plaque and debris prior to placement

===Longevity===
Although dental sealants do wear naturally and may become damaged over time, they usually last for around five to ten years, despite the heavy pressures endured by teeth during chewing each day. Longevity of dental sealants is also dependent on the type of material used. It is not uncommon for dental sealants to be retained well into adulthood. It is believed that bacteria and food particles may eventually become entrapped under dental sealants, and can thus cause decay in the very teeth intended to be protected. Dental sealants are inspected during routine dental visits to ensure that they are retained in the fissures of the teeth. Damaged sealants can simply be repaired by adding new sealant material. One of the major causes of the loss of sealants in the first year is salivary contamination.

On the basis of limited evidence both GIC and resin materials are equally acceptable in caries prevention, however retention rates between GIC and Resin have been shown to differ. Resin has been shown to be the superior product for retention. A 2-year clinical trial comparing GIC and Resin for dental sealants demonstrated that the GIC had a total loss rate of 31.78%, in contrast to the resin which had a total loss rate of 5.96% The study did acknowledge that GIC had its therapeutic advantages other than retention, this included the benefit of fluoride release and its use on partially erupted teeth. Though GIC has poorer retention rates, the fact that they release active fluoride in the surrounding enamel is very important. They can exert a cariostatic effect and increased release of fluoride, and for these reasons GIC is more of a fluoride vehicle rather than a traditional fissure sealant. All three materials are as effective as each other if the correct techniques are used to complete the procedure.

==Indications and contraindications ==
Although dental sealants are recommended to be placed in all children as soon as possible following eruption of permanent molars there are specific indications for when they are required to be placed. These indications mainly stem from issues that would cause a patient to be considered high caries risk, in order to prevent dental caries.

These indications are:

* Patients who are at increased risk of caries due to factors such as poor oral hygiene, lack of exposure to fluoride, previous and present caries experience, any current orthodontic treatment
* High sugar diet which increases the patient&#x27;s susceptibility to dental caries
* Teeth with enamel defects such as MIH, although the enamel defects may make it difficult to bond dental sealants to the tooth it is still essential that these teeth are sealed as the poor quality enamel makes then more susceptible to dental decay
* Patients with complicated medical history e.g. patients with underlying systemic diseases as these could increase the patient&#x27;s caries risk possibly due to having dry mouth as a result of medications or having prolonged treatment which could affect a patient&#x27;s ability to undertake adequate oral hygiene and maintain a low sugar diet 
* Early carious lesions can be treated with dental sealants in order to prevent invasive dental restorations. Dental sealants as treatment would be appropriate for occlusal caries which extend no more than a third of the way through dentine in the primary dentition and enamel lesions in the permanent dentition
* Dental sealants can also be indicated for dental defects such as dens in dente, amelogenesis imperfecta and deep fissures on lateral incisors 

There are no specific contraindications to placing dental sealants. For resin fissure sealants to be successful excellent moisture control is needed during placement of the fissure sealant. In cases where moisture control cannot be achieved then Glass Ionomer fissure sealants should be placed until a time where moisture control is adequate enough to place resin fissure sealants.

==Clinical procedure==
The exact technique depends on the material used and a good application technique will increase retention, which means sealants can last longer on the teeth. Generally, each quadrant is treated separately by using four-handed technique with an assistant and to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. The patient should wear safety glasses for protection from chemicals and curing light. Once the patient is prepared, the surface of the tooth must be cleaned to allow maximum contact of the etch and the dental sealant with the enamel surface. A rubber dam may be used to prevent saliva from contaminating the intended site to be sealed, although often these are not used, especially for younger children. Moisture control is more of an issue with resin based sealants than with glass ionomer sealants. The surface is cleaned and dried.

Resin sealants require a phosphoric acid solution (&quot;etch&quot;) to create microscopic porosity into which the sealant material can flow thereby increasing retention, increasing surface area and improving the strength of the bond between the sealant and the tooth surface. Etching time varies from 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the product. After that, the tooth must be rinsed and dried thoroughly for 15 to 20 seconds. Chalky appearance on the dried tooth means the tooth has been properly etched. If the tooth does not have this chalky appearance, the etching process must be repeated. The sealant is then applied to the tooth by carefully placing the sealant material into the prepared pits and fissures by using a disposable instrument provided by the manufacturer. Overfilling on the tooth should be prevented to minimize occlusal adjustment. The material is left for 10 seconds after the placement prior to curing to allow optimum penetration of the sealant material into the pores created by the etching procedure. Finally, the sealant is hardened by a curing light, which usually takes 20 to 30 seconds. Glass ionomer does not require light curing, however it will set faster with the usage of a curing light.

Resin-based sealants require an absolutely dry surface until polymerization is complete, so it is essential to avoid salivary contamination of the sealant site. A rubber dam or cotton roll isolation technique can be used to isolate the sealant site from saliva which is the common reason for sealant failure. Glass ionomer sealants have the advantage of not needing a dry field to be effective. In fact, the application procedure for glass ionomers can involve pressing a saliva-moistened finger onto the occlusal surface to push the sealant material into the pits and fissures.

Compared to a typical dental filling, where an injection of local anesthetic and the use of a dental drill may be involved, the application of dental sealants is significantly less invasive and generally considered quick and easy. The procedure is entirely painless, although a minor level of discomfort may be experienced by the patient. The etching gel may temporarily leave a sour taste in the mouth.

Pits and fissure sealants are used as effective controls in preventing caries. Sealants create a barrier which removes the biofilm from the occlusal surface. There are 4 sealant materials that can be used for the purpose of sealing pits and fissures. The materials are:

Resin-based sealant

* Often made up of bis-GMA 
* Polymerised by light 
* These sealants can be colourless, tinted or white

Glass-ionomer (GI)

* Has fluoride releasing properties

Polyacid-modified resin sealants

* Combination of resin based materials found in resin sealants and fluoride-releasing adhesive properties of GI

Resin-modified glass ionomer sealants

*  Longer working time than GI 

Historically methods such as; zinc phosphate cement, mechanical fissure eradication, prophylactic odontotomy, or chemical treatment with silver nitrate, were used to seal pits and fissures. These techniques are no longer used in modern-day practice.  Placement techniques for sealants rely on the type of material being used. However a common factor for all is that moisture control must be achieved. The maintenance of moisture control increases the treatment time and could be counter productive.

===Resin Based Sealants Application Technique===

* Ensure the tooth is free from any debris using a toothbrush or cotton wool roll.
* Isolate the tooth from any moisture - this can be done using whatever the clinician finds appropriate; cotton wool rolls, dry guard, saliva ejector. Using cotton wool rolls, dry guards or a saliva ejector will give optimum isolation of the site. A rubber dam may be used to prevent saliva from contaminating the intended site to be sealed, although often these are not used, especially for younger children. Moisture control is more of an issue with resin based sealants than with glass ionomer sealants
* Dry the tooth and etch the surface of the tooth that will be carrying the sealant - resin sealants require a phosphoric acid solution (&quot;etch&quot;) to create microscopic porosity into which the sealant material can flow thereby increasing retention, increasing surface area and improving the strength of the bond between the sealant and the tooth surface. Etching time varies from 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the product.
* Wash the etch with water and once again dry the tooth aiming to avoid any moisture contamination. A chalky appearance of the dried tooth means the tooth has been properly etched. If the tooth does not have this chalky appearance, the etching process must be repeated.
* Apply the resin to the surface ensuring sufficient material has been applied to cover all areas
* The sealant should now be light cured, this hardens the sealant
* Check the integrity of the sealant with a probe. May need to check occlusion with articulating paper and reduce sealant height.
* If the sealant cannot be picked off, application is successful. These sealants should be checked at recall appointments and re-applied as required.

===GI Sealant Technique===

For partially erupted teeth which are difficult to isolate some will use GIC (doesn&#x27;t need etching) as an interim option. GIC may have an advantage of fluoride release.

* Ensure the tooth is free from any debris using a toothbrush or cotton wool roll.
* Isolate the tooth from any moisture
* Dry the tooth
* Etch is not required for this technique
* Have the GI sealant mixed
* GI can be applied into fissures in several ways: using an excavator or using a finger
* Following the application of sealant in the clinicians chosen way, a small amount if petroleum jelly should be applied to the sealant. Glass ionomer does not require light curing, however it will set faster with the usage of a curing light.
* Ensure the sealant is not high in occlusion and removes any visible excess. These sealants should be checked at recall appointments and re-applied as required

== Prevalence ==
In the US, 42% of children aged 6–11 and 48% of adolescents aged 12–19 had fissure sealants on permanent teeth during 2011–2016.

In Greece, in a study from 2011, 8.3% of 12 year olds and only 8% of 15 year olds had at least one dental sealant on a molar tooth. When sealants were applied, DMFS scores were reduced by 11% in the 12 year olds and 24% in the 15 year olds.

In Portugal, a study has shown that over half (58.8%) of adolescents had a fissure sealant applied on at least one tooth.

In Denmark, 66% of 15-year-old children had at least one sealed molar.

In the UK in 2003, 13% of 8 year olds, 25% of 12 year olds and 30% of 15 year olds had at least one fissure sealant. In Ireland, the rates were 47%, 70% and 69% comparatively.

In Slovenia, around 94% of 12 year olds have at least one sealed molar.

Around 25% of Japanese children have at least one sealed molar.

A study surveying fissure sealants and dental caries in primary school girls in Saudi Arabia in 2017 found that only 1.3% of the children had at least 1 fissure sealant applied, but in another study, the overall figure was 9%.

== Summary ==
Dental sealants have been around us for a very long time and have been proven in research to be a safe and effective technique for preventing dental caries, especially on occlusal surfaces where teeth are particularly susceptible to decay. Through acting as a physical barrier to food and bacteria, dental sealant can prevent food from sticking to grooves in teeth and providing a place for bacteria to colonize. This is how dental sealants prevent that initial carious lesion. The materials used are resins, glass ionomers and hybrids; the effect of the materials used and retention rate depend on the type of material you use. But they are all effective in doing what they are used for, which is to prevent caries. Additionally, proper application, such as the tooth preparation, acid etch and adhesive also needs to be considered, otherwise, if they are applied incorrectly, it might resulted in unexpected and unfavorable clinical outcomes.

<text>Kimberly Ann Caldwell-Harvey is an American singer and television hostess. She rose to fame when she was a finalist on the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. After her American Idol stint, Caldwell was an entertainment correspondent and hosted various shows on the TV Guide Network. She released her debut album &quot;Without Regret&quot; on April 19, 2011.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Caldwell first sang publicly at age five in beauty pageants. She was a five-time junior vocalist winner on &quot;Star Search&quot;, and she also performed at the Grand Ole Opry. In 1995, she sang at the 50th wedding anniversary of former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush. Caldwell also appeared on the second and final season of &quot;&quot;, where she was rejected from the group and told she would do better as a solo vocalist.

Following her run on the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, Caldwell started working as a correspondent for the entertainment/extreme sports program &quot;54321&quot; on FOX Sports Network. She covered various events and movie premieres for the show before joining her fellow Season 2 &quot;Idol&quot; finalists on the road for the &quot;American Idols LIVE!&quot; tour, which played in 44 cities across the United States.

==Recent projects==
In 2008, Caldwell released two singles, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; and &quot;Gave Yourself Away&quot;. She also began filming a television series in 2010, Twentysixmiles aka Catalina Island miniseries, with John Schneider, and hosting a television game show called &quot;Jingles&quot;.

Caldwell hosted the television series, &quot;P. Diddy&#x27;s Starmaker&quot;, that premiered in January 2009. On the 2009 New Year&#x27;s Day edition of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, Caldwell was a supporter for her hometown friend Tunde Oyeneyin.

In 2012, Caldwell hosted the television series, &quot;Best Ink&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2006 her first single &quot;Who Will You Run To&quot; was released. A song written by Diane Warren and originally recorded by the band Heart. This single was released on Story Road Records.

In May 2008, Caldwell was asked out on a date by &quot;American Idol&quot; winner David Cook while on the red carpet before the show&#x27;s seventh-season finale. Their relationship lasted until January 12, 2009, when rumors of a breakup with Cook were confirmed by Caldwell&#x27;s rep, who stated in &quot;In Touch&quot; magazine: &quot;Kimberly and David ended their relationship just before the holidays. The couple remain good friends and being very private people, appreciate their privacy at this time.&quot;

Caldwell was featured on the August 25, 2010 episode of &quot;LA Ink&quot;, where she received a tattoo on her back of lyrics from her song &quot;With You I Can&quot;.

On June 18, 2011, Caldwell was crowned &quot;Queen of Don&#x27;t H8&quot; at Nashville Pride, a title handed to her in honor of her work with the LGBT community.

Caldwell got engaged to professional soccer player Jordan Harvey, having met him in Philadelphia when he played for the Philadelphia Union. They were married on December 31, 2014, in Palm Springs, California. Their daughter was born on October 7, 2015. Their second daughter was born on February 18, 2020.

<text>Frontenac station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is located at 2570 Ontario Street East in the Sainte-Marie neighbourhood, part of the Centre-Sud.

== Overview ==
Although part of the original network of the Metro, it opened two months after the rest of the system, on December 19, 1966. It served as the eastern terminus of the Green Line until the extension to Honoré-Beaugrand was completed in 1976. It is also the only station on the original Green Line not located under De Maisonneuve Boulevard.

Designed by Robillard, Jetté et Beaudoin, it is a normal side platform station built in tunnel. A transept provides access via several long escalators to the entrance, which was recently rebuilt according to a design by Christian Bisson.

Renovations occurred in November–December 2005, when the station was closed during weekends.

==Origin of the name==
Frontenac station takes its name from nearby Rue Frontenac, which in turn is named for Louis de Buade, sieur de Frontenac et de Palluau. The godson of King Louis XIII of France, he was governor-general of New France between 1672 and his death in 1698. Frontenac is famous for repelling the attack of Sir William Phips, saying, &quot;I will not respond to your general but through the mouths of my cannons and with gunfire.&quot;

<doc id="1303134" wikidata="Q407153" url="?curid=1303134" title="Ethyl acetate">
<text>Ethyl acetate (systematically ethyl ethanoate, commonly abbreviated EtOAc, ETAC or EA) is the organic compound with the formula , simplified to . This flammable, colorless liquid has a characteristic sweet smell (similar to pear drops) and is used in glues, nail polish removers, and the decaffeination process of tea and coffee. Ethyl acetate is the ester of ethanol and acetic acid; it is manufactured on a large scale for use as a solvent.

==Production and synthesis==
Ethyl acetate was first synthesized by the Count de Lauraguais in 1759 by distilling a mixture of ethanol and acetic acid.

In 2004, an estimated 1.3 million tonnes were produced worldwide. The combined annual production in 1985 of Japan, North America, and Europe was about 400,000 tonnes. The global ethyl acetate market was valued at $3.3 billion in 2018.

Ethyl acetate is synthesized in industry mainly via the classic Fischer esterification reaction of ethanol and acetic acid. This mixture converts to the ester in about 65% yield at room temperature:
The reaction can be accelerated by acid catalysis and the equilibrium can be shifted to the right by removal of water.

It is also prepared in industry using the Tishchenko reaction, by combining two equivalents of acetaldehyde in the presence of an alkoxide catalyst:

Silicotungstic acid is used to manufacture ethyl acetate by the alkylation of acetic acid by ethylene:


==Uses==
Ethyl acetate is used primarily as a solvent and diluent, being favored because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. For example, it is commonly used to clean circuit boards and in some nail varnish removers (acetone is also used). Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent. It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener. Ethyl acetate is present in confectionery, perfumes, and fruits. In perfumes it evaporates quickly, leaving the scent of the perfume on the skin.

Ethyl acetate is an asphyxiant for use in insect collecting and study. In a killing jar charged with ethyl acetate, the vapors will kill the collected insect quickly without destroying it. Because it is not hygroscopic, ethyl acetate also keeps the insect soft enough to allow proper mounting suitable for a collection. However, ethyl acetate is regarded as potentially doing damage to insect DNA, making specimens processed this way less than ideal for subsequent DNA sequencing.

===Laboratory uses===
In the laboratory, mixtures containing ethyl acetate are commonly used in column chromatography and extractions. Ethyl acetate is rarely selected as a reaction solvent because it is prone to hydrolysis, transesterification, and condensations.

===Occurrence in wines===
Ethyl acetate is the most common ester in wine, being the product of the most common volatile organic acid – acetic acid, and the ethyl alcohol generated during the fermentation. The aroma of ethyl acetate is most vivid in younger wines and contributes towards the general perception of &quot;fruitiness&quot; in the wine. Sensitivity varies, with most people having a perception threshold around 120 mg/L. Excessive amounts of ethyl acetate are considered a wine fault.

==Reactions==
Ethyl acetate is only weakly Lewis basic, like a typical carboxylic acid ester.

Ethyl acetate hydrolyses to give acetic acid and ethanol. Bases accelerate the hydrolysis, which is subject to the Fischer equilibrium mentioned above. In the laboratory, and usually for illustrative purposes only, ethyl esters are typically hydrolyzed in a two-step process starting with a stoichiometric amount of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide. This reaction gives ethanol and sodium acetate, which is unreactive toward ethanol:

In the Claisen condensation, anhydrous ethyl acetate and strong bases react to give ethyl acetoacetate: 

== Properties ==
=== Physical properties ===

Under normal conditions, ethyl acetate exists as a colorless, low-viscosity, and flammable liquid. Its melting point is −83 °C, with a melting enthalpy of 10.48 kJ/mol. At atmospheric pressure, the compound boils at 77 °C. The vaporization enthalpy at the boiling point is 31.94 kJ/mol. The vapor pressure function follows the Antoine equation
: formula_1
where
: formula_2 is the vapor pressure in bars,
: formula_3 is the absolute temperature in kelvins, and
: formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 are constants.

This function is valid within the temperature range of .

The enthalpy of vaporization in kJ/mol is calculated according to the empirical equation by Majer and Svoboda
: formula_7
where
: formula_8 is the reduced temperature, and formula_9 = 523.2 K is the critical temperature.
: formula_10 = 54.26 kJ/mol and formula_11 = 0.2982 are constants.

The following table summarizes the most important thermodynamic properties of ethyl acetate under various conditions.
==Safety==
The for rats is 5620 mg/kg, indicating low acute toxicity. Given that the chemical is naturally present in many organisms, there is little risk of toxicity.

Overexposure to ethyl acetate may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans exposed to a concentration of 400 ppm in 1.4 mg/L ethyl acetate for a short time were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000 ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400 ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or butyl acetate.

<text>Karl Heinrich Graf (February 28, 1815 – July 16, 1869) was a German Old Testament scholar and orientalist. He was born at Mülhausen (now Mulhouse) in Alsace and died in Meissen in Saxony.

He studied Biblical exegesis and oriental languages at the University of Strassburg under Édouard Reuss, and, after holding various teaching posts, was made instructor in French and Hebrew at the Landesschule of Meissen, receiving in 1852 the title of professor.

Graf was one of the chief founders of Old Testament criticism. In his principal work, &quot;Die geschichtlichen Bücher des Alten Testaments&quot; (1866) he sought to show that the priestly legislation of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers is of later origin than the book of Deuteronomy. He still, however, held the accepted view, that the Elohistic narratives formed part of the &quot;Grundschrift&quot; and therefore belonged to the oldest portions of the Pentateuch.

The reasons urged against the contention that the priestly legislation and the Elohistic narratives were separated by a space of 500 years were so strong as to induce Graf in an essay, &quot;Die sogenannte Grundschrift des Pentateuchs&quot;, published shortly before his death, to regard the whole &quot;Grundschrift&quot; as post-exilic and as the latest portion of the Pentateuch. The idea had already been expressed by Reuss, but since Graf was the first to introduce it into Germany, the theory, as developed by Julius Wellhausen, has been called the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis.

Graf also wrote, a study of Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples (Strassburg, 1842), &quot;Der Segen Moses Deut. 33&quot; (1857) and &quot;Der Prophet Jeremia erklärt&quot; (1862). See T. K. Cheyne, &quot;Founders of Old Testament Criticism&quot; (1893); and Otto Pfleiderer&#x27;s book translated into English by J. F. Smith as &quot;Development of Theology&quot; (1890).

<text>Préfontaine station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It opened on June 6, 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand station.

==Overview==
Designed by Henri Brillon, it is a normal side platform station, built partly in tunnel with a large open cut containing an entrance, the mezzanine and admitting natural light. A secondary entrance is located to the north of rue Hochelaga. 

In 2019, work began to install elevators at the station. On November 8, 2021, the station became accessible with the opening of three elevators, becoming the 18th accessible station in Montreal.

==Origin of the name==
The station is so named because it lies under the west side of parc Raymond-Préfontaine, close to rue Préfontaine. These were named for Raymond Préfontaine (1850–1905), mayor of the former city of Hochelaga, and subsequently mayor of Montreal (1898–1902).

<text>Cirrus is a worldwide interbank network that provides cash to Mastercard cardholders. As a subsidiary of Mastercard, it connects all Mastercard&#x27;s credit, debit, and prepaid cards, as well as ATM cards issued by various banks worldwide bearing the Mastercard/Maestro logo.

Founded in 1982, prior to its acquisition by Mastercard in 1987, Cirrus System, LLC was owned by Bank of Montreal, BayBanks Inc., First Interstate Bancorp, Mellon Bank, NBD Bancorp Inc., and Norwest Corp.

By default, Mastercard and Maestro cards are linked to the Cirrus network, but very often all three logotypes will be shown. Canadian, American and Saudi Arabian ATMs use this network alongside their local networks, and many banks have adopted Cirrus as their international interbank network alongside either a local one, the rival Plus ATM network owned by Visa, or both. In countries such as India and Bangladesh, the Cirrus network also serves as a local interbank network as well as an international one.

==Logo history==
The first logo, advertised from 1982 until 1992, was then changed to match those representing the other subsidiaries of Mastercard, which acquired Cirrus in 1987. The only exception is the colour pattern change. This can also be noticed through the re-branding in 2016, since all the logos of Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus have been equally modified.

<text>Bibi Besch (born Bibiana Maria Köchert; February 1, 1942 – September 7, 1996) was an Austrian-American film, television, and stage actress. She is best known for her portrayal of Dr. Carol Marcus in the science fiction film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). Her other notable film roles were in &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; (1987), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), and &quot;Tremors&quot; (1990). Besch also appeared in a number of television productions, including the television film &quot;The Day After&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot;, and received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

==Early life==
Bibiana Maria Köchert was born in Vienna in 1942, the younger of two daughters born to theater actress Gusti Huber, who starred in German films during World War II, and Gotfrid Köchert, an Austrian racing driver, who served in the Wehrmacht. She had an elder sister, Christiana Barbara Köchert. Gusti and her two daughters remained in Vienna throughout World War II, immigrating to the United States after the war ended. 

Joseph Besch, a radio executive and former U.S. Army captain, married Huber, a divorcee, in 1946, and became Huber&#x27;s daughters&#x27; stepfather; his stepchildren took his surname. Huber and Besch later had two children, born in the United States, Drea and Andrew, the half-siblings of Bibiana and Christiana. She had a daughter, Samantha Mathis, also an actress.

==Career==

Most of Besch&#x27;s early TV experience came from years spent on New York-based daytime soap operas — &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; (1966), &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1969), &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; (1973) and &quot;Somerset&quot; (1974). In later years she was seen in primetime soaps, such as &quot;Secrets of Midland Heights&quot; (1980), &quot;The Hamptons&quot; (1983), &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1984), &quot;Dallas&quot; (1985), &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1985-1986), &quot;Knots Landing&quot; (1989) and an episode of &quot;Melrose Place&quot; which aired on September 9, 1996, two days after her death.

Besch guest starred in a variety of television series, including &quot;Street Hawk&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;. Having appeared on a 1979 episode of James Arness&#x27; western series, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, she reunited with him in the 1981 made-for-TV film &quot;McClain&#x27;s Law&quot; which served as the two-hour debut episode of Arness&#x27; 1981–82 same-named police detective series.

She played Dr. Carol Marcus, the early love of Admiral James T. Kirk in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). Her other films included &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (1976), &quot;The Pack&quot; (1977), &quot;The Promise&quot; (1979), &quot;Meteor&quot; (1979), &quot;The Beast Within&quot; (1982), &quot;The Lonely Lady&quot; (1983), &quot;The Day After&quot; (1983), &quot;Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry&quot; (1986), &quot;He&#x27;s My Girl&quot; (1987), &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; (1987), &quot;Date with an Angel&quot; (1987), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), &quot;Tremors&quot; (1990), and &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990).

In 1992, she received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance in &quot;Doing Time on Maple Drive&quot;, which starred William McNamara and Jim Carrey as her sons. She received another Emmy nomination in 1993 for her recurring-character role as the neurotic mother of Janine Turner&#x27;s character on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. She continued to act until her death in 1996, having amassed well over 100 television and film credits.

==Death==
Bibi Besch died of breast cancer at Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles on September 7, 1996. She was 54 years old.

<text>Visa Plus is a worldwide interbank network that provides cash to Visa cardholders. As a subsidiary of Visa Inc., it connects all Visa credit, debit and prepaid cards, as well as ATM cards issued by various banks worldwide bearing the Visa / Electron logo.

Plus System, Inc. started out as a consortium formed by 34 major U.S. banks to build a national network of automated teller machines (ATM). It initially was composed of 2,000 ATMs linking 1,000 banks and their customers in 47 states.
As the booming ATM industry outgrew regional networks and began to go nationwide in the mid-1980s, credit-card giant Visa sought entry in the lucrative ATM network business and acquired a third of Plus System in 1987. Currently, there are over one million Plus-linked ATMs in 170 countries worldwide.

By default, Visa / Electron cards are linked to the Plus network, but very often all three logotypes will be shown.

Plus is widely used as a local interbank network most common in the United States where networks such as STAR, NYCE and Pulse also compete. It is also used in Canada, though it is significantly smaller than Interac there, and in India and Indonesia where there are numerous competing interbank networks. The main competitor of Plus System is the Cirrus network, which is owned by Mastercard, Visa&#x27;s longtime rival.

<text>Labradford is a U.S. post-rock musical group from Richmond, Virginia, founded in 1992. They have released six full albums from 1993 to 2001. Though not disbanded, its members have since been active with separate projects.

==Biography==
Founded in 1991, Labradford consists of bassist Robert Donne, guitarist/vocalist Mark Nelson, and keyboardist Carter Brown. Their music style is experimental ambient and post-rock, although their first releases were much more related to dark drone rock.

After a début single in 1992, they were signed by Kranky (which has remained their home since) who issued their début album &quot;Prazision LP&quot; in 1993. The group&#x27;s music mostly drifts on the guitar effects and the keyboard passages, with the vocals, when present, in the background.

In 1999, they started a tour with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and their Festival of Drifting series, which featured appearances from Pole, Robin Guthrie, Matmos, Papa M, and Sigur Rós.

Though the group has not officially disbanded, they have not released another album since 2001&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;&quot;, and the band members have apparently moved away from their former base of Richmond, Virginia. Robert Donne has joined the slow-core group Spokane, and is currently joining Gregor Samsa for their European tour. Mark Nelson continues to release records on Kranky under the name Pan American.

<doc id="1303161" wikidata="Q6956033" url="?curid=1303161" title="NYCE">
<text>The New York Currency Exchange (NYCE) is an interbank network connecting the ATMs of various financial institutions in the United States and Canada. NYCE also serves as an EFTPOS network for NYCE-linked ATM cards.

NYCE is based in Secaucus, New Jersey. Rivals of the network include STAR and Discover Card&#x27;s Pulse. It is owned by Fidelity National Information Services.

==Origins==
&quot;NYCE&quot; originally started as a local ATM network of banks located in the New York Metropolitan area, debuting in March 1985 with a network of 800 ATMs at six banks, including Bank of New York, Barclays Bank Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and Marine Midland Bank. It was one of the first networks of its kind, originating shortly after the invention of the ATM (automatic teller machine). Membership was open to all banks, credit unions and savings banks, and as use of ATMs grew, the network spread beyond its original New York Metro area; by the early 1990s, NYCE was the largest regional ATM network in the United States, with a network of 9,600 ATMs in 24 state available to its 17 million customers .

The public brand name, &quot;NYCE&quot;, is an acronym for &quot;New York Cash Exchange&quot;; the original corporate name was the New York Switch Corporation. 

The banks which founded and originally owned the network were: National Westminster Bank USA, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical Bank, Barclays Bank, Marine Midland Bank and the Bank of New York; in later years both BayBank and Fleet Bank from Boston became owners as well. The original Chairman of the Board was Edward Coakley of National Westminster Bank; some of the other members of the Board of Directors were Donald L. Boudreau and Ron Braco of Chase Manhattan, Gary Roboff and Michael Hegarty of Chemical Bank, Stu Segal and Roger Goldman of National Westminster, Robert Muth of Marine Midland, Bob Shay and Lindsey Lawrence of BayBank, and Dennis Lynch of Fleet.

==Current status==
At present, NYCE is the primary network of 301,500 ATMs with a customer base of 89 million users. NYCE is no longer owned by New York and Boston banks; it was wholly owned by Metavante Corporation, formerly a subsidiary of M&amp;I Bank and based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brown Deer, Wisconsin. On October 1, 2009, Metavante officially became a subsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services.

<doc id="1303183" wikidata="Q301129" url="?curid=1303183" title="Telecinco">
<text>Telecinco is a Spanish free-to-air television channel operated by Mediaset España. The channel was previously known as Tele 5, because it had first begun its experimental transmissions on 10 March 1989, and a year later, it was officially launched on 3 March, 1990, becoming the fifth of the national terrestrial television channels and the second private channel in Spain. In 1997, Tele 5 was rebranded as Telecinco, dropping the biscione-absent flower logo seen in other Mediaset channel logos.

==History==
On April 4, 1986, the Council of Ministers of Spain approved private television in the country, the legislation was approved in 1988. On August 25, 1989, the contest was held to obtain three private television licenses, which were granted to Gestevisión Telecinco, Grupo Antena 3 and Sogecable.

Tele 5 began transmissions experimentally in 1989 to officially begin broadcasting on 3 March 1990, although with limited coverage in Madrid and Barcelona. In January 1991, it achieved national coverage by starting broadcasts in the Canary Islands.

From its foundation until 1994, Tele 5 was directed by Valeriu Lazarov. During this period, a television channel similar to the Italian Canale 5 was made, with a lineup based mainly on entertainment programmes such as game, variety and comedy shows, in addition to some serials and movies, leaving the newscasts as 15-minute programmes broadcast at dawn and at night. With this formula the channel achieved its first audience successes.

In 1994, Maurizio Carlotti was appointed as the new director of the network, this with the aim of improving the financial and programme situation, as Tele 5 had lost audiences and advertisers to Antena 3. Carlotti opted for an increase in the production of series and programme formats that had not been tried out in Spain, such as late-night chat shows. In 1997, the channel was reformed so that the links with Canale 5 were scrapped (Telecinco became the first Mediaset channel to drop its trademark flower logo) and news output was increased. It was also at this time the channel re-branded from Tele 5 to Telecinco.

In 1999, Carlotti became the vice president of Telecinco and acted as CEO of Mediaset, so the direction of the channel passed to Paolo Vasile, who ran the channel from that year until October 2022. With the arrival of the new millennium, Telecinco began broadcasting reality shows and sporting events - the final of the first series of &quot;Gran Hermano&quot; remains Telecinco&#x27;s highest rated broadcast ever. In 2004 the channel began trading on the Madrid Stock Exchange and that same year, it won the title of most-watched channel from La 1. During this period, the channel began to be accused of trash TV due to the proliferation of spaces dedicated to gossip and related entertainment, which were present in Telecinco from its creation until 2023.

On 30 November 2005, Telecinco launched Telecinco Estrellas and Telecinco Sport, the network&#x27;s thematic channels dedicated to the consolidation of the brand in Spanish digital terrestrial television, which was released on the same day. On 20 September 2010, Telecinco began transmissions in HD.

In 2009 Gestevisión Telecinco and PRISA TV began the procedures for the merger of the open television divisions of both companies. The agreement took effect on 1 January 2011, the new company resulting from this process was renamed Mediaset España Comunicación.

After the merger, Mediaset came to control eight channels: Cuatro; LaSiete; Factoría de Ficción; Divinity; Boing; Energy and Nueve, so part of its programming was allocated to the grids of the rest of the group&#x27;s channels. In May 2014, LaSiete and Nueve were closed due to a court order. In 2016 Telecinco launched Be Mad.

In 2017, the channel was involved in a scandal due to an alleged sexual abuse that occurred during &quot;Gran Hermano&quot;, the local version of Big Brother. The crisis resulted in the abandonment of some advertisers due to the network&#x27;s handling of the crisis, which was accused of acting late, exposing the victim to reliving the situation and trying to silence the information related to the act.

In 2022, Telecinco began to suffer from an exhaustion in its programming, which resulted in the loss of leadership in favor of Antena 3. For this reason, Mediaset initiated a reform in the channel&#x27;s programming, Paolo Vasile left his position after twenty-three years and was replaced by Alessandro Salem, who assumed greater responsibility in the position. 

In 2023 Telecinco started to eliminate gossip and social affairs programmes for more family-oriented content such as game and reality shows, in addition to establishing a series of guidelines for presenters and collaborators on the channel, to which they prohibited them from issuing political ideas on entertainment programs or criticising other programs on the network and some celebrities. Its new slogan, &quot;Contigo siempre&quot;, was intended to reflect the new family-friendly style. The channel had been criticised for chat shows such as &quot;Sálvame&quot; taking up the vast majority of the channel&#x27;s daytime output, and questionable scheduling, such as programmes with a 16+ rating aired across daytime slots.

== Programming ==

In 2014, Telecinco was the most viewed channel in Spain with a share of 14.5%.
Telecinco is a general channel catering to all audiences. It shows popular films, series, and entertainment shows.

The channel&#x27;s programming includes such series as &quot;La que se avecina&quot;, &quot;Sin tetas no hay paraíso&quot;, and &quot;Aída&quot;, as well as entertainment shows such as &quot;Crónicas marcianas&quot; and &quot;Hay una cosa que te quiero decir&quot; and the talent show &quot;The Voice&quot;. For many years the channel had a reputation for celebrity gossip and daytime chat shows such as &quot;Sálvame&quot; and &quot;El programa de Ana Rosa&quot;, however after the channel&#x27;s reformatting in 2023, which saw &quot;Sálvame&quot; axed and Ana Rosa moved to a more competitive afternoon timeslot, this has started to decrease.

The channel is also known for its reality shows, having produced a number of popular series in the last decade – &quot;Gran Hermano&quot;, &quot;Supervivientes&quot;, &quot;Hotel Glam&quot;, and &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot;, amongst others. Reality shows made up much of the content of the channel&#x27;s other programmes. All of these programmes experienced a substantial ratings boost thanks to the so-called &quot;Reality Effect&quot;.

== Production ==
Telecinco has digitalised their production facilities. It allowed them to broadcast their channels in up to Spanish and original language, stereo sound, interactive services and high-definition television.

<text>Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc. (TMS, also known as Toyota USA) is the North American Toyota sales, marketing, and distribution subsidiary devoted to the United States market. Founded in 1957 in California, TMS currently employs more than 6,500 people. As of spring 2017 Toyota moved to a new campus in Plano, Texas. Construction of this new facility began in the fall of 2014, and is located at the corner of Texas State Highway 121 and Legacy Drive, across the street from the FedEx Office Headquarters, and the J. C. Penney World Headquarters. The former location of Toyota&#x27;s headquarters was Torrance, California, where they supervised 14 regional offices. TMS oversees the sales of Toyota and Lexus products in 49 states through a network of over 1,200 Toyota dealers (of whom more than 900 also previously sold Scion vehicles) and over 200 Lexus dealers. California has the greatest number of Toyota dealerships of any other state at 172 dealerships. Toyota vehicles in Hawaii are distributed by Servco Pacific. TMS develops Toyota&#x27;s television campaigns and other nationwide marketing materials, and supervises dealer marketing to ensure that dealers present a uniform image. TMS also manages regional distribution, which occurs through 12 parts centers and five vehicle centers. James E. Lentz III is the president of TMS.

==Corporate affairs==

===Corporate headquarters===
====Plano headquarters move====
In 2014 Toyota announced it was moving its United States headquarters to Plano, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The new headquarters will have around 4,000 total employees, including about 2,000 employees from the current headquarters and 1,000 employees from Toyota Financial Services, which also was in Torrance. The company plans to permanently move most employees by the time of completion of the new headquarters, late 2016 or early 2017, while initially the company will open a temporary office in Texas and move small groups of employees there in the interim. The administration of the Dallas Japanese School, the supplementary Japanese school serving Japanese citizen and Japanese American children living in the DFW area, stated that it expected to receive an additional 150 students due to the headquarters move.

On Tuesday April 29, 2014, Mayor of Dallas Mike Rawlings stated that Toyota had considered moving the US offices to the City of Dallas but decided against it due to the quality of the Dallas Independent School District (DISD). A spokesperson of Toyota stated that the company, when deciding where to relocate, considered higher education, K-12 schools, access to the airport, and cost of living. The spokesperson did not say which cities other than Plano were being considered. In response to the move, the mayor of Torrance, Frank Scotto, stated that he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; by the decision.

Matthew Haag of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; stated that Toyota may have moved its headquarters to suburban Plano because of its similarities to Torrance, another suburban city.

====Former headquarters====
The company formerly maintained its headquarters in Torrance, California in Greater Los Angeles. The campus has six buildings, with a total of of office space. In 2012 a 1.1 megawatt hydrogen fuel cell generator was installed at the campus, giving half of the power for the six buildings during the peak demand period. The generator does not generate emissions. By using the generator, as of 2012 the company saves $130,000 in utility bill charges. As of 2014 the headquarters has 5,300 employees.

On October 31, 1957, Toyota opened its first United States office in a former Rambler/Ford dealership, at 6000 Hollywood Blvd. As of July 2022 that building is still a Toyota dealership. Because the city had airline access to Tokyo and because of the proximity to the Port of Los Angeles the US division of Toyota located its headquarters in the Los Angeles area.

The Torrance headquarters opened in 1982. In 2003 the Toyota South Campus in Torrance received the Golden Nugget Award. After Toyota&#x27;s departure the Torrance headquarters has been sold for redevelopment and by 2022 the campus has been demolished.

== Distribution ==
In early 1968, Jim Moran was contacted by a friend from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and wanted to talk to him. Moran asked what a &quot;Toyota&quot; was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market at the end of the 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55 mph on the interstate, Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren&#x27;t as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business. On October 26, 1968, he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the Port of Jacksonville and Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year.

There was a similar story for Thomas H. Friedkin. During the 1960s, one of Friedkin&#x27;s hobbies was racing cars. He was friends with Carroll Shelby, famous for designing the AC Cobra and the Shelby Mustang. Shelby had turned down an offer to become a distributor for Toyota because Lee Iacocca told Shelby that &quot;the domestic makers were going to push the Japanese back into the ocean&quot;. Shelby introduced Friedkin to Toyota, and Friedkin entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the Port of Houston. Gulf States Toyota Distributors (GST) was founded in 1969.

Toyota Dealers in the remaining 40 states receive their vehicles from Toyota Motor Sales.

=== Southeast Toyota Distributors ===
Southeast Toyota Distributors, a subsidiary of JM Family Enterprises, is the world&#x27;s largest independent distributor of Toyota vehicles in the United States. With 177 independent Toyota dealers in the five-state region of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina, Southeast Toyota sells 24% of Toyota sales in the U.S.

=== Gulf States Toyota Distributors ===
Gulf States Toyota Distributors, a subsidiary of Friedkin Group, is the other independent distributor of Toyota vehicles in the United States. Their 158 independent Toyota dealers sell vehicles in the five states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas.

== Marketing ==
Toyota Motor Sales USA purchased the naming rights to the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas in 2003. The 20-year deal was worth $95 million; $4.75 million per year. It was the 10th most expensive naming deal for an NBA facility. The arena is home to the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association and was the first time a sports facility in Houston was sponsored by an international company.

<text>Friedrich Bleek (4 July 1793, in Ahrensbök in Holstein (a village near Lübeck)27 February 1859, in Bonn), was a German Biblical scholar.

==Life==
At 16 Bleek&#x27;s father sent him to the gymnasium at Lübeck, where he became so interested in ancient languages that he abandoned his idea of a legal career and resolved to devote himself to the study of theology. After spending some time at the university of Kiel, he went to Berlin, where, from 1814 to 1817, he studied under De Wette, Neander and Schleiermacher. So highly were his merits appreciated by his professors — Schleiermacher was accustomed to say that he possessed a special charisma for the science of Introduction — that in 1818 after he had passed the examinations for entering the ministry he was recalled to Berlin as a Repentant or tutorial fellow in theology, a temporary post which the theological faculty had obtained for him.

Besides discharging his duties in the theological seminary, he published two dissertations in Schleiermacher&#x27;s and GCF Lücke&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; (1819-1820, 1822), one on the origin and composition of the Sibylline Oracles, &quot;Über die Entstehung und Zusammensetzung der Sibyllinischen Orakel&quot;, and another on the authorship and design of the Book of Daniel, &quot;Über Verfasser und Zweck des Buches Daniel&quot;. These articles attracted much attention, and were distinguished by those qualities of solid learning, thorough investigation and candour of judgment which characterized all his writings.

Bleek&#x27;s merits as a rising scholar were recognized by the minister of public instruction, who continued his stipend as Repentant for a third year, and promised further advancement in due time. But the attitude of the political authority underwent a change. De Wette was dismissed from his professorship in 1819, and Bleek, a favorite pupil, incurred the suspicion of the government as an extreme democrat. Not only was his stipend as Repentant discontinued, but his nomination to the office of professor extraordinarius, which had already been signed by the minister Karl Altenstein, was withheld. At length it was found that Bleek had been confounded with a certain Baueleven Blech, and in 1823 he received the appointment.

During the six years that Bleek remained at Berlin, he twice declined a call to the office of professor ordinarius of theology, once to Greifswald and once to Kanigsberg. In 1829, however, he was induced to accept Lücke&#x27;s chair in the recently founded University of Bonn, and entered upon his duties there in the summer of the same year. For thirty years he laboured with ever-increasing success, due not to any attractions of manner or to the enunciation of novel or bizarre opinions, but to the soundness of his investigations, the impartiality of his judgments, and the clearness of his method. In 1843 he was raised to the office of consistorial councillor, and was selected by the university to hold the office of rector, a distinction which has not since been conferred upon any theologian of the Reformed Church. He died suddenly of apoplexy on 27 February 1859.

Bleek&#x27;s works belong entirely to the departments of Biblical criticism and exegesis. His views on questions of Old Testament criticism were advanced in his own day; for on all the disputed points concerning the unity and authorship of the books of the Old Covenant he was opposed to received opinion. But with respect to the New Testament his position was conservative. An opponent of the Tübingen school, his defence of the genuineness and authenticity of the gospel of St John is among the ablest that have been written; and although on some minor points his views did not altogether coincide with, those of the traditional school, his critical labors on the New Testament must nevertheless be regarded as among the most important contributions to the maintenance of orthodox opinions.

His greatest work, his commentary on the epistle to the Hebrews (&quot;Brief an die Hebraer erlautert durch Einleilung, Ubersetzung, und fortlaufenden Commentar&quot;, in three parts, 1828, 1836 and 1840) won the highest praise from men like De Wette and Fr. Delitzsch. This work was abridged by Bleek for his college lectures, and was published in that condensed form in 1868. In 1846 he published his contributions to the criticism, of the gospels (&quot;Beiträge zur Evangelien Kritik&quot;, pt. i.), which contained his defence of St John&#x27;s gospel, and arose out of a review of JHA Ebrard&#x27;s &quot;Wissenschaflliche Kritik der Evangelischen Geschichte&quot; (1842).

==Posthumously-published works==
The following works were published after Bleek&#x27;s death:
#His Introduction to the Old Testament (&quot;Einleitung in das Alte Testament&quot;), (3rd ed., 1869); En,g. trans. by GH Venables (from 2nd ed., 1869); in 1878 a new edition (the 4th) appeared, under the editorship of Julius Wellhausen, who made extensive alterations and additions
#his Introduction to the New Testament (3rd ed., W Mangold, 1875), Eng. trans. (from 2nd German ed.) by William Urwick (1869, 1870)
#his Exposition of the First Three Gospels (&quot;Synoptische Erklärung der drei ersten Evangelien&quot;), by H Holtzmann (1862)
#his Lectures on the Apocalypse (&quot;Vorlesungen über die Apokalypse&quot;), (Eng. trans. 1875). Besides these there has also appeared a small volume containing Lectures on Colossians, Philemon and Ephesians (Berlin, 1865)
Bleek also contributed many articles to the &quot;Studien und Kritiken&quot;. For further information on Bleek&#x27;s life and writings, see Kamphausen&#x27;s article in Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;; Frédéric Lichtenberger&#x27;s &quot;Histoire des idées religieuses en Allemagne&quot;, vol. iii.; Diestel&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte des Alten Testamentes&quot; (1869); and TK Cheyne&#x27;s &quot;Founders of Old Testament Criticism&quot; (1893).

<text>The Bryggen inscriptions are a find of some 670 medieval runic inscriptions on wood (mostly pine) and bone found from 1955 and forth at &quot;Bryggen&quot; (and its surroundings) in Bergen, Norway. It has been called the most important runic find in the twentieth century. Before the find of these inscriptions, there was doubt whether the runes were ever used for anything else than inscriptions of names and solemn phrases. The Bryggen find showed the everyday use that runes had in this area, and presumably in other parts of Scandinavia as well. Another important aspect of the find was that many of the inscriptions were obviously at least as recent as the 14th century. Previously it was believed that the use of runes in Norway had died out long before.

The inscriptions have numbers for Bergen finds, mostly &quot;B&quot; followed by three figures.

Many of the inscriptions follow the formula &quot;Eysteinn á mik&quot; (&quot;Eysteinn owns me,&quot; B001), and were most likely used as markers of property – like modern-day name tags. Some contain short messages of different types, such as &quot;Ást min, kyss mik&quot; (&quot;my darling, kiss me,&quot; B017) and others have longer messages such as business letters and orders. Yet others contain short religious inscriptions, often in Latin, such as &quot;Rex Judæorum In nomine Patris Nazarenus&quot; (B005) and may have been intended as amulets.

The inscriptions are currently kept at &quot;Bryggens Museum&quot; in Bergen, and some are on display.

==Examples found at Bryggen or nearby==

==Other interesting inscriptions==
* One of the inscriptions, listed as N B145, refers to the pagan Norns. It has both a complete Skaldic dróttkvætt verse and Virgil&#x27;s famous verse &quot;Omnia vincit amor et nos cedamus amori&quot; engraved.
* Another one, listed as N B368 M was written on the wax tablet and was supposed to be hidden under the layer of wax with some trivial writing. It was a top-secret message calling to someone to change the sides in the civil war: &quot;I would ask you this, that you leave your party. Cut a letter in runes to Ólafr Hettusveinn&#x27;s sister. She is in the convent in Bergen. Ask her and your kin for advice when you want to come to terms. You, surely, are less stubborn than the Earl.&quot; The letter was continued on another wax tablet. Ólafr Hettusveinn is probably Olav Ugjæva, died in 1169.
* N B257 (dated ca. 1335) is a poetic charm, apparently a piece of love magic, similar in content to a curse in the Eddaic poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;.
* Likewise, N B380 contains a pagan inscription, reading ”May you be healthy, and in good spirits. May Þórr receive you, may Óðinn own you.”

<doc id="1303192" wikidata="Q7830837" url="?curid=1303192" title="Toyota Motor North America">
<text>Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) is the operating subsidiary that oversees all operations of the Toyota Motor Corporation in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Its operations include research and development, manufacturing, sales, marketing, after sales and corporate functions, which are controlled by TMNA but sometimes executed by other subsidiaries and holding companies. The company is headquartered in Plano, Texas, with offices in several locations including Georgetown, Kentucky, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and New York City.

Toyota’s operations in North America began on October 31, 1957, and today&#x27;s Toyota Motor North America was established in 2017 from the consolidation of three companies: Toyota Motor North America, Inc., which controlled Toyota’s corporate functions; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. which handled marketing, sales, and distribution in the United States; and Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America which oversaw operations at all assembly plants in the region. While all three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus.

== History ==
=== Beginnings in North America (1957–1979) ===

In August 1957, Toyota sent three employees to the United States to show off the company&#x27;s new car, the Toyopet Crown to car dealers and the media to gauge interest in expanding sales overseas. The vehicle received positive reviews, with media outlets praising the vehicle for having 50% thicker steel than the average American car at the time and the black Deluxe model for being nicely appointed with lots of chrome and luxurious items like a radio, heater and whitewall tires which prompted the press to liken it to a &quot;baby Cadillac&quot;. But Toyota knew from testing that the vehicle, designed for the muddy, slow, unpaved roads of Japan, had serious high-speed performance issues. When the Crown was driven on a highway, the engine suddenly began making loud noises and output dropped. But the promising initial showing, along with the strong reputation of the Crown in Japan gave Toyota a false sense of confidence and the company started to pursue exports to the United States.

Toyota’s operations in North America officially began on October 31, 1957 with the establishment of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (TMS) which oversaw sales, marketing, and distribution of Toyota’s vehicles in the United States. The fledgling company&#x27;s headquarters was located in a former Rambler dealership in Hollywood, California with a warehouse near the harbor where vehicles would be imported in Long Beach, California. Sales started on July 10, 1958, and by the end of the year, the company sold 287 Toyopet Crown sedans and one Toyota Land Cruiser.

The company faced problems almost immediately. American automakers saw the increase in sales of imported compact cars and launched several compact cars from the autumn of 1959, including the Chevrolet Corvair, Ford Falcon, and Chrysler Valiant. As a result, sales of imported European cars plunged and the Crown was a flop with buyers finding it underpowered (due to the known high-speed performance issues) and overpriced. In response, exports of the Crown to the United States were suspended in December 1960. However, the Land Cruiser gained a following, allowing the company to make a profit in 1961, but there was not yet a major market for sport-utility vehicles in the United States.

The company&#x27;s first major success in the United States came in 1965 with the Toyota Corona compact car, which was redesigned specifically for the American market with a more powerful engine, factory-installed air conditioning and an automatic transmission. The Corona helped increase U.S. sales of Toyota vehicles to more than 20,000 units in 1966 (a threefold increase) and helped the company become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States by 1967. In 1968, the Toyota Corolla subcompact car was introduced to the United States and would go on to become the world’s all-time best-selling automobile. This success led Toyota to establish a more permanent presence in North America, opening a headquarters building in Torrance, California, south of Los Angeles in February 1967.

The energy crisis of the 1970s was a major turning point in the American auto industry. Before the crisis, large and heavy vehicles with powerful but inefficient engines were common. But in the years after, consumers started demanding high-quality and fuel-efficient small cars. Domestic automakers, in the midst of their malaise era, struggled to build these cars profitably, but foreign automakers like Toyota were well positioned. This, along with growing anti-Japanese sentiment, prompted the U.S. Congress to consider import restrictions to protect the domestic auto industry.

Toyota’s first manufacturing investment in the United States came in 1972 when the company struck a deal with Atlas Fabricators, to produce truck beds in Long Beach, in an effort to avoid the 25% &quot;chicken tax&quot; on imported light trucks. By importing the truck as an incomplete chassis cab (the truck without a bed), the vehicle only faced a 4% tariff. Once in the United States, Atlas would build the truck beds and attach them to the trucks. The partnership was successful and two years later, Toyota purchased Atlas (which had been financially struggling) and it would eventually be renamed Toyota Auto Body California (TABC) as part of the company&#x27;s Toyota Auto Body manufacturing subsidiary.

Toyota also began designing automobiles and conducting research and development in the United States in the 1970s to better understand and reflect the tastes of American consumers. Calty Design Research was established in California in 1973 and Toyota Technical Center, U.S.A. (TTC, later renamed TMNA R&amp;D) was established in 1977 in the town of Ann Arbor, Michigan, not far from Detroit, the center of automobile manufacturing in the United States.

=== Investing in America (1980–1989) ===
After the successes of the 1970s, and the threats of import restrictions, Toyota started making additional investments in the North American market in the 1980s. In 1981, Japan agreed to voluntary export restraints, which limited the number of vehicles the nation would send to the United States each year, leading Toyota to establish assembly plants in North America. The U.S. government also closed the loophole that allowed Toyota to pay lower taxes by building truck beds in America. Despite those challenges, Toyota also expanded its headquarters in Torrance, California into a larger campus of buildings in 1982, as the company marked 25 years in America.

Efforts to open a Toyota assembly plant in the United States started in 1980, with the company proposing a joint-venture with the Ford Motor Company. Those talks broke down in July 1981. Eventually in 1984, the company struck a deal with General Motors (GM) to establish a joint-venture vehicle manufacturing plant called NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.) in Fremont, California. GM saw the joint venture as a way to get access to a quality small car and an opportunity to learn about the Toyota Production System and The Toyota Way, a series of lean manufacturing and management philosophies. For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment. The first Toyota assembled in America, a white Corolla, rolled off the line at NUMMI on October 7, 1986. In 1991, Toyota started building pickup trucks at NUMMI, allowing the company to completely avoid the chicken tax.

Toyota took the lessons it learned from NUMMI and went onto establish the wholly-owned Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA (later renamed Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky) and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada plants in 1986. The Kentucky plant was Toyota&#x27;s largest manufacturing facility in the world, a title it continues to hold and the Canadian operation would later expand to three separate plants that comprise Toyota&#x27;s second largest manufacturing facility.
Before the decade was out, Toyota introduced Lexus, a new division that was formed to market and service luxury vehicles in international markets, including North America. Prior to the debut, Toyota&#x27;s two existing flagship models, the Crown and Century, both catered exclusively for the Japanese market and had little global appeal that could compete with international luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar. The company had been developing the brand and vehicles in secret since August 1983, at a cost of over US$1 billion. The LS 400 flagship full-size sedan debuted in 1989 to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque.

=== Manufacturing expansion (1990–2009) ===
In 1990, Toyota purchased Bodine Aluminum (later renamed Toyota Motor Manufacturing Missouri and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Tennessee) which had three plants in St. Louis and Troy, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee to produce cast aluminum engine components for use in other manufacturing facilities.

In 1996, the company established two more manufacturing facilities: the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana assembly plant in Princeton, Indiana and the Toyota Motor Manufacturing West Virginia engine and transmission plant in Buffalo, West Virginia. At the same time, the automaker also created the Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (TMMNA) subsidiary in Erlanger, Kentucky to oversee all Toyota manufacturing operations in North America.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, another engine plant was established 2001 in Huntsville, Alabama.

Next, Toyota shifted to expanding its truck producing capacity, building two specialized assembly plants. Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Baja California was established in Tijuana in 2002, becoming the company&#x27;s first assembly plant in Mexico, which was followed by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas in San Antonio in 2003.

TMMNA would merge with the Toyota Technical Center, U.S.A. (TTC) research and development subsidiary in April 2006 to form Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America, Inc. (TEMA).

Another assembly plant, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi was established in Blue Springs, Mississippi in 2007.

=== Toyota in North America today ===
The NUMMI plant was closed in March 2010, after GM pulled out of the joint venture amid a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. It marked the first time the company had ever closed a factory. The plant was Toyota&#x27;s only unionized plant in the U.S. and the company said that it was no longer economical to have a plant so far away from the supplier lines it had established in the Midwest.

The current Toyota Motor North America company was established in 2017 as part of the &quot;One Toyota&quot; initiative, TMS and TEMA combined with Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (TMA), which controlled Toyota’s corporate functions, to form Toyota Motor North America. While the three companies continue to exist in legal name, they operate as one company out of one headquarters campus in Plano, Texas. Toyota continues to operate research and design centers in Michigan and in October 2017 opened a new Production Engineering and Manufacturing Center (PEMC) in Georgetown, Kentucky, to serve as the go-between for design and manufacturing.

Toyota opened its second assembly plant in Mexico in 2019, Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Guanajuato located in Apaseo el Grande, which would also specialize in producing pickup trucks.

<text>Edward Grady &quot;Ed&quot; Coffman Jr. is a computer scientist. He began his career as a systems programmer at the System Development Corporation (SDC) during the period 1958–65. His PhD in engineering at UCLA in 1966 was followed by a series of positions at Princeton University (1966–69), The Pennsylvania State University (1970–76), Columbia University (1976–77), and the University of California, Santa Barbara (1977–79). In 1979, he joined the Mathematics Center at Bell Laboratories where he stayed until his retirement as a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff 20 years later. After a one-year stint at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, he returned to Columbia University in 2000 with appointments in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. He retired from teaching in 2008 and is now a professor emeritus still engaged in research and professional activities.

==Research==
Coffman is best known for his seminal research together with his international collaborations, measured in part by some 150 co-authors in his collection of publications. His work can be found in over 180 articles in technical journals devoted to original research contributions. He published 4 graduate-level text books, and papers in the proceedings of some 250 conferences and workshops, most of these being preliminary versions of journal articles. In his research, Coffman has been a generalist following many parallel paths in engineering and applied mathematics. The directions he has taken have drawn on the tools of combinatorial optimization and the theory of algorithms, along with those of applied probability and stochastic processes. The processes studied include those in the theories of scheduling, bin packing, sequential selection, graphs, and dynamic allocation, along with those in queueing, polling, reservation, moving-server, networking, and distributed local-rule systems (e.g. cellular automata). His contributions have been divided between mathematical foundations and the design and analysis of approximation algorithms providing the basis for engineering solutions to NP-hard problems. Computer and network engineering applications have been broad in scope; a partial list includes research addressing problems in the scheduling and storage allocation functions of computer operating systems, storage architectures, data structures, computer timing problems such as deadlocks and synchronization, Internet congestion, peer-to-peer file sharing networks, stream merging, self-assembly processes of molecular computing, minimalist algorithms in sensor networks, optical burst switching, and dynamic spectrum management in cognitive networks. The list expands greatly when including the myriad applications in industrial engineering and operations research of Coffman&#x27;s research in scheduling and bin-packing theory in one and two dimensions. As of 11 November 2015, his works have been cited 13,597 times, and he has an h-index of 55.

Coffman has been active professionally serving on several editorial boards, dozens of technical program committees, setting research agendas in workshops of the National Research Council, co-founding the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, and the special interest groups on performance evaluation of both ACM and IFIPS.

<doc id="1303197" wikidata="Q3224353" url="?curid=1303197" title="Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)">
<text>Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s Cinderella is a musical written for television, but later played on stage, with music by Richard Rodgers and a book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based upon the fairy tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;, particularly the French version &quot;Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre&quot; (&quot;Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper&quot;), by Charles Perrault. The story concerns a young woman forced into a life of servitude by her cruel stepmother and self-centered stepsisters, who dreams of a better life. With the help of her fairy godmother, Cinderella is transformed into a princess and finds true love with the kingdom&#x27;s prince.

&quot;Cinderella&quot; is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957, as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role. The broadcast was viewed by more than 100 million people. It was subsequently remade for television twice, in 1965 and 1997. The 1965 version starred Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon. The 1997 version starred Brandy in the title role, with Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother. Both remakes add songs from other Richard Rodgers musicals and have adaptations to the Hammerstein book.

The musical has been adapted for the stage in a number of versions, including a London West End pantomime adaptation, one produced by New York City Opera that follows the original television version closely, and various touring productions. A 2013 adaptation on Broadway starred Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana, with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane; since then, it has been revived in the US and internationally.

==Background==
In the 1950s, television adaptations of stage musicals were fairly common. In 1955, NBC broadcast the Broadway musical &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, starring Mary Martin. It was a hit, and the network looked for more family-oriented musical projects. Richard Rodgers had won an Emmy Award for his score to &quot;Victory at Sea&quot;, a documentary series about World War II, and several of his musicals with Oscar Hammerstein II, as well their film &quot;State Fair&quot;, had achieved outstanding success. NBC approached Rodgers and Hammerstein and asked them to do something never previously attempted: write an original musical expressly for television (rather than merely adapting an existing one to the television special format). The team decided to adapt the fairy tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

As they were new to television musicals, they sought the advice of an industry insider, Richard Lewine, the Vice President in charge of color television at CBS and a cousin of Richard Rodgers. He told Rodgers and Hammerstein that CBS was also seeking a musical project and had already signed Julie Andrews, who was then starring in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; on Broadway. Rodgers recalled, in his autobiography: &quot;What sold us immediately was the chance to work with Julie.&quot; Rodgers and Hammerstein signed with CBS. The two retained ownership of the show and had control over casting, direction, set and costumes, while CBS controlled the technical aspects of the broadcast and had an option for a second broadcast. CBS announced the production in September 1956. In adapting the familiar fairy tale, &quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein stayed faithful to the original Charles Perrault&quot; version. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Hammerstein said, &quot;It took me seven months to write the book and lyrics&quot;. He told the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;: &quot;We want the kids who see it to recognize the story they know. Children can be very critical on that score. But, of course, their parents will be watching too, so we have tried to humanize the characters without altering the familiar plot structure.&quot;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
In the village square, the Herald proclaims: &quot;The Prince Is Giving a Ball&quot; to celebrate Prince Christopher&#x27;s 21st birthday, an age appropriate for him to marry. The ladies of the kingdom are thrilled at the prospect of meeting him. Cinderella, whose father has died, is treated as a servant by her ill-tempered and selfish stepmother and two stepsisters, Joy and Portia. She carries their tall stack of shopping parcels home for them, as they bully and order her about. Left alone in her corner near the fire, she dreams of an exotic life as a princess or anything other than a servant (&quot;In My Own Little Corner&quot;). Meanwhile, the King and Queen prepare for the big celebration (&quot;Royal Dressing Room Scene&quot;), and the servants discuss the food and other planning (&quot;Your Majesties&quot;). The royals hope their son will meet a suitable bride at the Ball, but the Prince is apprehensive about meeting all the eager women of the kingdom. The Queen is touched by overhearing the King&#x27;s pep-talk to his son and tells the king she loves him (&quot;Boys and Girls Like You and Me&quot;).

As Cinderella&#x27;s stepsisters get ready for the Ball, hoping that they will catch the Prince&#x27;s eye, they laugh at Cinderella&#x27;s dreams. After they leave, Cinderella imagines having gone with them (&quot;In My Own Little Corner&quot; (reprise)). Her Fairy Godmother appears and is moved by Cinderella&#x27;s irresistible and powerfully-held wish to go to the Ball. She magically transforms the girl&#x27;s plain clothing into a beautiful gown and her little mouse friends and a pumpkin into a glittering carriage with footmen (&quot;Impossible; It&#x27;s Possible&quot;); Cinderella leaves for the Ball.

===Act II===
Cinderella arrives at the palace at 11:30; before she enters, her Godmother warns her not to stay past midnight. The Prince is bored by the attention of all the young ladies with whom he has had to dance, including the stepsisters (&quot;Gavotte&quot;). Cinderella&#x27;s radiant entrance immediately attracts everyone&#x27;s attention, but her transformation is so complete that no one recognizes her. The Prince is intrigued. They dance together and instantly fall in love (&quot;Ten Minutes Ago&quot;). Seeing the Prince with a beauty whom they do not recognize, the stepsisters ruefully ask each other why he wouldn&#x27;t prefer a &quot;usual&quot; girl like them (&quot;Stepsisters&#x27; Lament&quot;). As the Prince and Cinderella dance, he declares his love for her (&quot;Do I Love You Because You&#x27;re Beautiful?&quot;). As they embrace, the clock strikes midnight, and Cinderella flees before the magic wears off, but in her haste she leaves behind a glass slipper.

===Act III===
The next morning, Cinderella&#x27;s stepmother and stepsisters reminisce about the Ball and find Cinderella&#x27;s &quot;imagination&quot; surprisingly accurate about what it must have been like going to the Ball (&quot;When You&#x27;re Driving Through the Moonlight&quot;) and dancing with the Prince (&quot;A Lovely Night&quot;). Meanwhile, despite his parents&#x27; cautions about a girl he just met, the Prince is searching for the owner of the slipper who fled so hurriedly from the Ball. The Herald tries the slipper on all the women of the kingdom (&quot;The Search&quot;). At Cinderella&#x27;s house, the slipper will not fit any of the ladies. Cinderella&#x27;s stepmother works to steer the Herald away from Cinderella, but she is not home; she is hiding in the Palace garden. The Herald returns to the palace to inform the Prince that he has not found the missing girl. The Herald then sees Cinderella hiding and places her under arrest. Prodded by the Fairy Godmother, he tries the slipper on Cinderella. It fits, and the Prince is called back to the garden where he recognizes his beloved (&quot;Do I Love You Because You&#x27;re Beautiful?&quot; (reprise)). The stepmother and stepsisters are now very solicitous and help Cinderella prepare for her wedding; she and the Prince marry with respendent pomp, as her Fairy Godmother observes that &quot;impossible things are happening every day&quot;.

==Television productions==

===1957 original production===
The musical had to fit into the 90-minute TV program with six commercial breaks, so the show was divided into six short acts. Rehearsals started on February 21, 1957. Director Ralph Nelson and choreographer Jonathan Lucas, who had choreographed for &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;, were both experienced with musical material on television. Rodgers&#x27; friend, Robert Russell Bennett, provided the orchestrations. Alfredo Antonini, a veteran with CBS, conducted and served as music director. In early March, the company moved to CBS Television Color Studio 72, the first CBS-TV color studio in New York and the smallest color studio in the CBS empire at the time. The 56 performers, 33 musicians and 80 stagehands and crew were crammed into the small studio together with four giant RCA TK-40A color TV cameras, a wardrobe of up to 100 costumes, over half a dozen huge set pieces, special effects equipment and numerous props. The orchestra played in a small room with special equipment to overcome the suppressed acoustics. One of the four color TV cameras failed during the live telecast, adding to the production&#x27;s technical difficulties. CBS invested in a massive marketing campaign, as did the sponsors, Pepsi-Cola and the Shulton Company (then maker of Old Spice). Ed Sullivan also promoted &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which would be seen in his usual Sunday night time slot, with an appearance by Rodgers and Hammerstein on his show the previous Sunday. Many of the songs were released on records and to radio stations to familiarize the prospective audience with the music. The broadcast was produced for $376,000, more than double the sum usually spent on a TV production at that time.

On March 31, 1957, at 8:00 pm Eastern time, &quot;Cinderella&quot; was broadcast live in the Eastern, Central and Mountain time zones in both black and white and compatible color; the West Coast received a delayed black and white-only broadcast starting at 8:00 pm Pacific time. Beyond the United States, it was carried by CBS affiliates in the U.S. territories of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; in Canada it was broadcast on CBC. It starred Andrews in the title role and Jon Cypher as The Prince, and featured Howard Lindsay as The King, Dorothy Stickney as The Queen, Edie Adams as the Fairy Godmother, Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley as stepsisters Portia and Joy, Ilka Chase as the Stepmother, and Iggie Wolfington as The Steward. Joe Layton appeared uncredited in the ensemble. There were no understudies. Rodgers had told &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;If Julie can&#x27;t make the show, then neither can we.&quot;

The Nielsen TV rating for the program was 18,864,000 &quot;homes reached during an average minute&quot; of the broadcast. More than 107 million viewers saw the broadcast. Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance, as was Rodgers for the score. An original cast album was released to stores the morning after the broadcast. Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s plans to bring an expanded version of the musical to Broadway never materialized, though their last two shows together, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, each contain a rags-to-riches story for the heroine. A black and white kinescope of the March 17, 1957, dress rehearsal survives (it was thought discarded but was rediscovered in 2002) and has been issued on DVD.

===1965 version===

The 1957 premiere had been broadcast before color videotape was available, so only one performance could be shown. After the musical&#x27;s success in London and elsewhere as a stage production, CBS decided to produce another television version in 1965, with Richard Rodgers as Executive Producer and a teleplay revised by Joseph Schrank (Hammerstein had died in 1960). The new script hewed closer to the traditional tale, although nearly all of the original songs were retained and sung in their original settings. A new sequence opens the story: the Prince stops at Cinderella&#x27;s house with his retinue for a drink of water after returning from his travels. Cinderella, home alone, and not knowing who the handsome traveler is until a page utters the words &quot;Your Highness&quot;, kindly gives the Prince water from the well. After the Prince leaves, he sings &quot;Loneliness of Evening&quot;, which had been composed for &quot;South Pacific&quot; in 1949 but not used in that musical. The names of the stepsisters were changed from the original production, the &quot;Royal Dressing Room Scene&quot; was omitted, and the fairy godmother reveals herself immediately, instead of resisting Cinderella&#x27;s first wishes to attend the ball.

The 1965 version was directed by Charles S. Dubin with choreography by Eugene Loring and recorded on videotape (at CBS Television City in Hollywood) for later broadcast. The cast featured Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon as the Queen and King; Celeste Holm as the Fairy Godmother; Jo Van Fleet as the Stepmother, with Pat Carroll and Barbara Ruick as her daughters Prunella and Esmerelda; and Stuart Damon as the Prince. Lesley Ann Warren, at age 18, played the title role. The film also features rare on camera appearances by dubbers Betty Noyes and Bill Lee, who play a couple that briefly sing about their daughter (played by Trudi Ames). The first broadcast was on February 22, 1965, and it was rebroadcast eight times through February 1974. The 1965 debut had a Nielsen rating of 42.3, making it the highest-rated non-sports special on CBS from the beginning of the Nielsen ratings until 2009, and the 50th highest-rated show of any kind during that period.

===1997 version===

The successful 1993 CBS adaptation &quot;Gypsy&quot;, starring Bette Midler and produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, revived interest in TV musicals. The day after &quot;Gypsy&quot;″s original broadcast, Whitney Houston approached the producers to suggest a similar starring vehicle for herself. Zadan and Meron suggested Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;, with Houston in the title role. After four years of delay, the project was restarted. Now a mother, and feeling that she had aged out of the role, Houston offered it to her younger friend Brandy and took on the role of Fairy Godmother instead. Both Rodgers and Hammerstein had died by then; the remake was adapted by Robert L. Freedman and directed by Robert Iscove, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Produced by Houston and Debra Martin Chase for Walt Disney Television, it first aired on November 2, 1997. The racially diverse cast starred Brandy as Cinderella, Houston as the Fairy Godmother, Bernadette Peters as the Stepmother, and Paolo Montalban as the prince, with Whoopi Goldberg as the queen, Victor Garber as the king, Jason Alexander as Lionel, the herald. The stepsisters were Veanne Cox as Calliope and Natalie Desselle as Minerva. Sixty million viewers watched the broadcast, and &quot;Cinderella&quot; was again a popular and critical hit; the Disney Home Video version, also released that in 1997, became the best-selling video of a TV movie ever released.

Several songs were added, including &quot;Falling in Love with Love&quot; from the musical &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;, sung by the Stepmother; &quot;The Sweetest Sounds&quot; from the musical &quot;No Strings&quot;, sung by Cinderella and the Prince; and &quot;There&#x27;s Music in You&quot;, written for the 1953 film &quot;Main Street to Broadway&quot;, sung as the finale by the Fairy Godmother. &quot;The Prince Is Giving a Ball&quot; was merged with parts of &quot;Your Majesties&quot; with additional lyrics by Fred Ebb. Music producers Chris Montan and Arif Mardin rearranged the orchestration to achieve a more contemporary sound. Several changes were also made to the Hammerstein plot: The Fairy Godmother begins the story, explaining that nothing is impossible, and the stepsisters&#x27; names are changed. Disguised as a peasant, the Prince (feeling isolated in the castle) wanders in the marketplace (worrying his herald, Lionel), meets Cinderella, and they find each other charming. As in 1965, the Fairy Godmother shows up to grant Cinderella&#x27;s wishes without question. At the ball, embarrassed by questions about her family and background, Cinderella escapes to the garden in tears, where the Fairy Godmother appears for moral support. After her stepmother returns from the ball and is particularly cruel, Cinderella packs her belongings to run away from home. Her Fairy Godmother advises her to share her feelings with the Prince. After trying the slipper on all the other maidens, the Prince and Lionel overtake Cinderella on her journey to freedom. Meeting her gaze, the Prince recognizes her and places the slipper on her foot. At their wedding, the Fairy Godmother blesses the couple.

==Stage productions==

===1958 to 2008===
The musical was first performed on stage at the London Coliseum in 1958 in a holiday pantomime adaptation produced by Harold Fielding.. Harold Fielding produced this version, which opened on December 18, 1958, and played through the holiday season. Yana played Cinderella, with Tommy Steele as her best friend Buttons, Bruce Trent as the Prince, Jimmy Edwards as the King, Betty Marsden as the fairy godmother, Kenneth Williams and Ted Durante as the Ugly Sisters, and Godfrey James as Dandini. Songs from &quot;Me &amp; Juliet&quot; and by Steele were added for Steele and Trent. Several new numbers were written for Steele and Trent. The production was played at the Hippodrome in Bristol the next season.

Stage versions began to appear in U.S. theaters by 1961, filling out the show&#x27;s running time with other songs from the Rodgers catalogue. The Los Angeles Civic Light Opera produced the show in 1990 featuring Steve Allen, Jayne Meadows, and Rose-Marie. The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization had a new stage version of the show prepared that stayed closer to the 1957 broadcast version; New York City Opera produced this version of the musical in 1993 and 1995 with Sally Ann Howes as The Fairy Godmother, Crista Moore as Cinderella, George Dvorsky as The Prince, Nancy Marchand (1993) and Jean Stapleton (1995) as The Stepmother, George S. Irving as The King and Jane Powell as The Queen. It revived the production in 2004 with Eartha Kitt as The Fairy Godmother, Sarah Uriarte Berry as Cinderella, Christopher Sieber as The Prince, John &quot;Lypsinka&quot; Epperson as The Stepmother, Dick Van Patten as The King, Renée Taylor as The Queen, Lea DeLaria as Joy and Ana Gasteyer as Portia. Another new version was prepared that was based on the 1997 Freedman teleplay. This was given a US tour from November 2000 through 2001 and starred Kitt as the Fairy Godmother, Deborah Gibson and later Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Jessica Rush as Cinderella, Paolo Montalban as the Prince, and a gender-bending Everett Quinton as the Stepmother, stopping at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in 2001, where Sigler played the title role. 

A 30-week Asian tour of &quot;Cinderella&quot; starred Lea Salonga and Australian Peter Saide. The production was directed by Bobby Garcia, with choreography by Vince Pesce. Costume design was by Renato Balestra, with sets by David Gallo. The tour started in Manila, Philippines, on July 29, 2008. The show then went on to several cities in China, including Xian, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Gunagzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong and toured in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, and Japan, playing into mid-2009. A cast album was issued in 2008. An all-female production of the musical in Japan in 2008 featured J-Pop group Morning Musume and veteran members of the Takarazuka Revue. The production ran throughout August 2008 at Shinjuku Koma Theater in Tokyo. The lead roles of Cinderella and the Prince were performed by Morning Musume members Ai Takahashi and Risa Niigaki.

===Broadway===

Douglas Carter Beane wrote a new book for the musical&#x27;s first Broadway production. In his plot, Cinderella opens Prince Topher&#x27;s eyes to the injustice in the kingdom. The prince&#x27;s parents have died, leaving the kingdom in the hands of a villainous regent who has been the prince&#x27;s mentor and has duped his young charge into approving oppressive acts against the peasants. The rebel Jean-Michel, a new character, and stepsister Gabrielle are in love and demand reform. The score includes the familiar songs from the original version and several other songs from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalogue.

The show, produced by Robyn Goodman, began previews on Broadway on January 25 and officially opened on March 3, 2013, at the Broadway Theatre. Mark Brokaw directed the production, with Josh Rhodes choreographing, and the cast included Laura Osnes in the title role, Santino Fontana as the Prince, Victoria Clark as crazy Marie/the Fairy Godmother, Harriet Harris as Ella&#x27;s stepmother, Peter Bartlett as the Prime Minister, Ann Harada and Marla Mindelle as stepsisters Charlotte and Gabrielle, and Greg Hildreth as Jean-Michel. Designers included Anna Louizos (sets), William Ivey Long (costumes) and Kenneth Posner (lighting). The production was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning one for Long&#x27;s costume design. Reviews were mixed, with most critics praising Osnes&#x27;s performance.

Keke Palmer was a replacement in the title role. A report in &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;casting an African American actor as such an iconic – and typically pale – character is emblematic of the progress Broadway is making, slowly and haltingly, in employing actors of color in a broader array of parts.&quot; The production closed on Broadway on January 3, 2015, after 41 previews and 770 regular performances. National tours and international productions have followed.

==Reception==
The 1957 version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; was seen by the largest audience in history at the time of its premiere: 107,000,000 people in the US, fully 60% of the country&#x27;s population at that time. &quot;Variety&quot; estimated that 24.2 million households were tuned into the show, with an average of 4.43 viewers each. Jon Cypher later remembered leaving the studio a few minutes after the broadcast had ended and finding the Manhattan streets deserted because so many had stayed in to watch the broadcast.

A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Jack Gould characterized the musical as &quot;a pleasant &quot;Cinderella&quot; that lacked the magic touch&quot;. He wrote that the broadcast received an &quot;extraordinary range of reactions; it was either unreservedly enjoyed, rather angrily rejected or generally approved, subject to significant reservations&quot;. He praised Andrews as a &quot;beguiling vision&quot; in &quot;lovely color video&quot;. But he complained about the book (&quot;What possessed Mr. Hammerstein to turn the stepsisters into distasteful vaudeville clowns?&quot;); about errors in &quot;the most elementary kind of showmanship&quot;; about costume (&quot;couldn&#x27;t Cinderella have been dressed in a dreamlike ball gown of fantasy rather than a chic, form-fitting number?&quot;); and the staging (&quot;cramped ... excellent depth, but limited width marred the ballroom scene&quot;). He judged the songs &quot;not top-drawer Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot; and &quot;reminiscent and derivative of some of their earlier successes&quot; but praised four of them and said: &quot;In television, where original music is virtually nonexistent, these add up to quite a treat ... some current [Broadway] musicals cannot boast as much melodically.&quot;

The 1965 version was broadcast repeatedly. The 1997 production was the number one show of the week, with over 60 million viewers. It became the highest-rated TV musical in a generation. Although it was a hit with audiences, it received mixed reviews. Theater historian John Kenrick called it a &quot;clumsy remake&quot; of the musical but commented that Bernadette Peters&#x27; &quot;shtick trying on the glass slipper is hilarious&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the performers (Montalban has &quot;an old-fashioned luxurious voice&quot;; Jason Alexander &quot;provides comic relief&quot;; Goldberg &quot;winningly blends royal dignity with motherly meddling&quot;; Peters &quot;brings vigor and sly comedy&quot;) but commented that the musical &quot;was always a pumpkin that never turned into a glittering coach ... the songs are lesser Rodgers and Hammerstein ... it doesn&#x27;t take that final leap into pure magic. Often charming and sometimes ordinary, this is a cobbled-together &quot;Cinderella&quot; for the moment, not the ages.&quot; Other critics, however, praised the presentation. One reviewer wrote: &quot;Grade: A, a version both timely and timeless.&quot; Another agreed: &quot;this version has much to recommend it.&quot; An encore broadcast on Valentine&#x27;s Night 1998 drew another 15,000,000 viewers.

Reviews for the Broadway version were mixed. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the 2013 Broadway production a &quot;glittery patchwork of a show&quot; that &quot;wants to be reassuringly old-fashioned and refreshingly irreverent, sentimental and snarky, sincere and ironic, all at once.&quot; Brantley felt that the show &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to know quite what&quot; it wants to be. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; praised the cast, especially Osnes, the costumes and the choreography and opined that &quot;the production is an absolute joy, marred only by occasional slowness of pace.&quot; Richard Zoglin, writing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, noted that the new production is &quot;brightly colored, high spirited and well sung&quot;, but compared it unfavorably with the &quot;emotionally alive&quot; 1957 broadcast. A reviewer from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;The fundamental problem with ... Beane&#x27;s perplexing, wholly unromantic and mostly laugh-free new book ... is that it denies the audience the pleasure of instant reversals of fortune. ... This new version ends up collapsing the basic logic of the familiar story and tramples all over the musical soul of a score from another era&quot;. On the other hand, the reviewer from &quot;USA Today&quot; liked the production, commenting that &quot;Osnes and a gifted supporting cast make this fairy tale very much their own – a scrumptious trifle that, for all its hokey moments, will charm theatergoers of all ages.&quot; An Associated Press review praised Beane&#x27;s script and wrote that it &quot;crackles with sweetness and freshness, combining a little &quot;&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot; with some &quot;Les Misérables&quot;&quot;. It also found the cast &quot;first-rate&quot; and the overall story &quot;quirky, yet heart filled&quot;.

==Recordings==
Columbia Records recorded the musical selections from the first telecast of &quot;Cinderella&quot; on March 18, 1957, nearly two weeks before the show aired, in monaural and stereophonic sound, releasing the mono version in 1957 and then the stereo version in 1958. The stereo version was later reissued on CD by Sony. The black-and-white kinescope recording made during the telecast was broadcast on PBS in December 2004 as part of its &quot;Great Performances&quot; series. It was later released on DVD with a documentary including most of its original players, as well as a kinescope of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; the preceding Sunday, featuring Hammerstein reciting one of the songs to orchestral accompaniment.

In 1959 RCA Victor released an abridged &quot;Cinderella&quot; with Mary Martin and The Little Orchestra Society, which was released on CD in 2010 (Sepia 1144). A cast LP album of the 1965 telecast was also issued by Columbia Masterworks Records and on a Sony Masterworks CD. All three of the telecast versions of &quot;Cinderella&quot; have been released on DVD. A cast recording of the 2013 Broadway production was issued by Ghostlight Records in 2013.

<text>Methyl acetate, also known as MeOAc, acetic acid methyl ester or methyl ethanoate, is a carboxylate ester with the formula CH3COOCH3. It is a flammable liquid with a characteristically pleasant smell reminiscent of some glues and nail polish removers. Methyl acetate is occasionally used as a solvent, being weakly polar and lipophilic, but its close relative ethyl acetate is a more common solvent being less toxic and less soluble in water. Methyl acetate has a solubility of 25% in water at room temperature. At elevated temperature its solubility in water is much higher. Methyl acetate is not stable in the presence of strong aqueous bases or aqueous acids. Methyl acetate is not regulated as a volatile organic compound in the USA.

==Preparation and reactions==
Methyl acetate is produced industrially via the carbonylation of methanol as a byproduct of the production of acetic acid. Methyl acetate also arises by esterification of acetic acid with methanol in the presence of strong acids such as sulfuric acid; this production process is famous because of Eastman Kodak&#x27;s intensified process using a reactive distillation.

===Reactions===
In the presence of strong bases such as sodium hydroxide or strong acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid it is hydrolyzed back into methanol and acetic acid, especially at elevated temperature. The conversion of methyl acetate back into its components, by an acid, is a first-order reaction with respect to the ester. The reaction of methyl acetate and a base, for example sodium hydroxide, is a second-order reaction with respect to both reactants.

Methyl acetate is a Lewis base that forms 1:1 adducts with a variety of Lewis acids. It is classified as a hard base and is a base in the ECW model with EB =1.63 and CB = 0.95.

==Applications==
A major use of methyl acetate is as a volatile low toxicity solvent in glues, paints, and nail polish removers.

Acetic anhydride is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate in a process that was inspired by the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis.

<doc id="1303203" wikidata="Q7265461" url="?curid=1303203" title="QIO">
<text>QIO (Queue I/O) is a term used in several computer operating systems designed by the former Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts.

I/O operations on these systems are initiated by issuing a QIO call to the kernel. There are two types of QIO - Queue I/O and Queue I/O with Wait.

For QIO without wait, the call returns immediately. If the request is successfully enqueued, the actual operation occurs asynchronously. On completion, status is returned in the QIO status doubleword. The QIO request may also specify that completion set an event flag or issue an Asynchronous System Trap (AST).

The call may also be issued as QIOW (Queue I/O and Wait for completion), allowing synchronous I/O. In this case, the wait-for-event-flag operation is combined so the call does not return until the I/O operation completes or fails.

The following operating systems implement QIO(W):
* RSX-15
* RSX-11 (including all of the variants)
* RSTS/E (synchronous only, emulated by the RSX runtime system)
* OpenVMS

== QIO arguments in VMS ==

Under VMS, the arguments to the QIO call are:

* The event flag to set when the operation completes. It isn&#x27;t possible to &quot;not&quot; specify an event flag; flag 0 is valid. It is perfectly permissible to have multiple simultaneous operations that set the same event flag on completion. It is then up to the application to sort out any confusion this might cause, or just ignore that event flag.
* The channel, a small integer previously associated with the device. At this level, all operations on disk files and directories (filename parsing, directory lookup, file opening/closing) are done by appropriate QIO requests.
* The function code to be performed. 6 bits are assigned to the basic code (such as read, write), with a further 10 bits for &quot;modifiers&quot; whose meaning depend on the basic code.
* The optional I/O status block (IOSB), which is cleared by the QIO call, and filled in on completion of the I/O operation. The first two bytes hold the completion status (success, end of file reached, timeout, I/O error, etc.), while the next two bytes normally return the number of bytes read or written in the operation. The meaning, if any, of the last four bytes is operation-dependent.
* The optional AST routine to invoke when the operation completes.
* An additional parameter (whose meaning is up to the caller) to be passed to the AST routine.
* A partially standardized list of up to six parameters known as P1 through P6. The first two parameters typically specify the I/O buffer starting address (P1), and the I/O byte count (P2). The remaining parameters vary with the operation, and the particular device. For example, for a computer terminal, P3 might be the time to allow for the read to complete whereas, for a disk drive, it might be the starting block number of the transfer.

== QIO completion ==

There are three different ways to sense when the queued I/O operation has completed:
# When the event flag becomes set.
# When the first two bytes of the IOSB become nonzero.
# When the AST routine executes.

== Unusual QIOs that require complex processing ==

Simple QIOs, such as read or write requests, are either serviced by the kernel itself or by device drivers. Certain more complicated requests, specifically those involving tape drives and file-level operations, were originally executed by an Ancillary Control Processor (ACP) (a special purpose task with its own address mapping).

The Files-11 ODS-1 file system on RSX-11 was implemented by a subroutine library that communicated with a task named F11ACP using a special set of QIOs called the &quot;ACP QIOs.&quot; The equivalent functionality for controlling magnetic tape devices was provided by a task named MTAACP.

Originally, the Files-11 ODS-2 file system was provided by F11BACP on VMS, but the functionality of F11BACP was later incorporated into the VMS kernel to save the overhead of process context switches, and is now called an XQP (eXtended Qio Processor).

Probably the most complex single QIO request possible is the VMS terminal driver&#x27;s call with the modifier; this QIO requires all six additional parameters:

; P1 : The address of the buffer into which the input characters are received
; P2 : The length of the buffer, limiting the maximum number of characters to read. If the buffer is filled, the read will complete successfully, even if the user does not type a line-terminator character. Zero is allowed, in which case the read will terminate successfully with zero characters read.
; P3 : The maximum number of seconds to wait for more input. This is only used if the modifier is present, and a value of zero means zero seconds: the read will terminate immediately, so the only possible input will be whatever had been &quot;typed ahead&quot; by the user.
; P4 : The address of the optional &quot;terminator mask&quot;, specifying which ASCII characters terminate the read. If omitted, this defaults to the usual VMS line delimiters including carriage-return (but not line-feed). It is possible to specify a mask with &quot;no&quot; line terminators, in which case the read will only complete when the buffer is full, or the timeout has elapsed.
; P5 : The address of a prompt string to be displayed to the user before accepting input. The advantage of providing this prompt, instead of as a prior write operation, is automatic redisplay in any situation requiring a refresh of the input line while the read is in progress (such as after an operator message has been broadcast to the terminal, or the user hits CTRL/R to redisplay the line).
; P6 : The length of the prompt string.

By appropriate choices of the above parameters, it is possible to do both terminal input and output with the one call, there is no need to use the regular call for terminal output at all.

<text>The Oldenburg or Oldenburger is a warmblood horse from the north-western corner of Lower Saxony, what was formerly the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. The breed was built on a mare base of all-purpose farm and carriage horses, today called the Alt-Oldenburger. The modern Oldenburg is managed by the Association of Breeders of the Oldenburger Horse, which enacts strict selection of breeding stock to ensure that each generation is better than the last. Oldenburgers are tall sport horses with excellent gaits and jumping ability. The breeding of Oldenburg horses is characterized by very liberal pedigree requirements and the exclusive use of privately owned stallions rather than restriction to a state-owned stud farm.

==History==

Until the 17th century, horses in the region of Oldenburg were likely small and plain, but strong enough to be used to work the heavy soil of the Frisian coast. These horses would become the foundation of the Oldenburg&#x27;s neighbors from Holstein to Groningen. One of the first to take a vested interest in organized horse breeding was Count Johann XVI (1540–1603). Johann XVI purchased high-class Frederiksborgers from Denmark, refined Turkish horses and powerful Neapolitan and Andalusian horses for use with his own breeding stock. His successor, Count Anton Gunther (1583–1667) not only brought back from his travels the most desirable horses of the time, but made the stallions available to his tenants.
Rigorous stallion inspections were held beginning in 1715 in Ostfrisia, and spread to Oldenburg in 1755. Such inspections became mandatory under state regulation in 1820. These processes enabled breeders to mold the horses quickly to suit the market. In time, the Oldenburg and its neighbor the Ostfriesen became &quot;luxury horses&quot;, stylish, high-stepping carriage horses, though they were practical farm horses as well. What set the Oldenburg and Ostfriesen apart was the lack of a state-owned stud farm. As private breeders, mare and stallion owners had and retain greater freedom in purchasing breeding stock, and as a result Oldenburg and Ostfriesen horses were exported far and wide. In 1923, the Ostfriesen studbook and Oldenburg studbook merged to form today&#x27;s Oldenburg Horse Breeders&#x27; Association (GOV).

===Post-war era===
All the roles that the Alt-Oldenburger played – carriage horse, artillery horse, farm horse – were overtaken in succession by mechanization during the 1940s and 1950s. However, increased leisure time and expendable income set the stage for recreational riding to come into its own, which it did. Oldenburg breeders changed direction, moving towards producing riding horses of the same renown as their carriage horses.

The first foreign stallion imported to improve the riding horse qualities of the Oldenburg mares was &quot;Condor&quot;, a dark bay Anglo-Norman. He was followed by &quot;Adonis xx&quot; in 1959, this time a full Thoroughbred. A veritable slew of Thoroughbred sires were approved for Oldenburg mares over the next 15 years: &quot;Manolete xx&quot;, &quot;Miracolo xx&quot;, &quot;Guter Gast xx&quot;, &quot;More Magic xx&quot;, &quot;Makuba xx&quot;, and not least of all, &quot;Vollkorn xx&quot;. &quot;Vollkorn xx&quot; produced one of Oldenburg&#x27;s first international sport horses: &quot;Volturno&quot;, out of a &quot;Manolette xx&quot; daughter, was a member of the Olympic silver medal-winning Eventing team in 1976.
Condor&#x27;s success encouraged the Oldenburg breeders to choose French sires over German ones. Prominent among these were &quot;Furioso II&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Futuro&quot; in 1969, both by &quot;Furioso xx&quot;, &quot;Tiro&quot;, and &quot;Zeus&quot;, who was by French Anglo-Arabian &quot;Arlequin x&quot;. There was also the Trakehner, &quot;Magister&quot;, though Trakehners were not used in Oldenburg to the same extent that they were in neighboring Hannover. In 1972 added flair came to the Oldenburg from the French Anglo-Arabian stallion, &quot;Inschallah x&quot;, who donated his expressive gaits and dry features to his offspring.

And technology continued to change the Oldenburg. Advances in artificial insemination techniques meant that stallions did not have to be nearby to be part of the breeding population. Since the 1970s, use of horses from all over Europe has greatly increased. German Warmbloods like the Hanoverian, Holsteiner, Westphalian, and Trakehner, in addition to Dutch Warmbloods and Selle Français continued to modernize the Oldenburg.

The slogan of the German Oldenburg Verband is that &quot;Quality is the only standard that counts,&quot; evidenced by their liberal acceptance of a wide variety of pedigrees and colors. Unlike other registries that are limited to locally bred horses, or which prefer one color to another, the modern Oldenburg selects stallions and mares based only on their quality as dressage and jumping horses.

===Modern Oldenburg===
Today the Oldenburg Association or &quot;Verband&quot; has over 220 approved sires and 7000 mares in addition to the 96 sires and 1300 mares that are part of the &quot;Oldenburg International&quot; breeding program for show jumping. These figures make Oldenburg one of the largest studbooks in Germany. Oldenburg is the largest studbook in terms of breeding area.

Each autumn, the Oldenburg Verband holds the &quot;Stallion Days&quot; in Vechta, during which the young stallions undergo their licensing evaluation. After the results of the licensing are announced, many are auctioned off to new homes at stallion stations, or as gelding prospects bound for performance homes. The &quot;Old Stallion Parade&quot; occurs on the last day, showcasing all the fully approved, performance tested stallions. However, this event is not just a pageant, as the offspring of mature stallions are subject to intense scrutiny. The best stallions of their age class, based on their offspring, receive a &quot;premium&quot; or award for their achievements in breeding.

There are several other auctions throughout the year in Vechta featuring selected youngsters, &quot;köraspirants&quot;, elite riding horses and broodmares. The price-toppers at the elite sales regularly fetch over 100,000 Euros. At the mixed sales there are a wider range of horses available. The verband also puts on free jumping competitions for young horses.

The Oldenburg Verband places special emphasis on mare lines, many of which trace back to the Alt-Oldenburg ancestors. Selected from the mare inspections throughout the year, the best young mares are invited to the Elite Broodmare Show in Rastede. There they compete not only for the States Premium - originally a bribe to keep breeders from exporting high-quality broodmares - but for the title of Champion Mare.

==Characteristics==
The modern Oldenburg can best be identified by the &quot;O&quot; and crown brand on the left hip. Horses of the &quot;Oldenburg International&quot; program have a similar brand, with an &quot;S&quot; within a crowned, incomplete &quot;O&quot;. Underneath the Oldenburg brand are the last two numbers of the horse&#x27;s life number. The official brand can only be placed on Oldenburg horses prior to 2 years of age. A digital micro-chip implanted in the crest of the neck is another identification method used.

The appearance of an individual Oldenburg can vary, and it is usually better to describe any warmblood by its actual parentage. However, Oldenburg is known for producing among the most &quot;modern&quot; examples of riding horses: expressive heads and long legs. Otherwise, they are selected to fit the model of a sport horse, generally built uphill with a reasonably long neck and a long, moderately sloped pelvis. Ideally, they stand between .

Oldenburg has, as part of its liberality, been very forward-thinking about unusually colored warmbloods. Between the United States and Germany, no fewer than 8 tobiano pinto stallions are included in the roster. Most Oldenburgers are black, brown, bay, chestnut, or grey.

Even among warmbloods, most Oldenburgers have expressive, elastic gaits with a great deal of suspension. The quality of the walk, trot, or canter is highly individual, but their gaits are selected to be suitable for sport. All three gaits are straight when viewed from the front or back, and rhythmical at all times. The walk is diligent and open, the trot is active and elastic, and the canter is uphill and adjustable. Over fences, even most dressage-bred Oldenburgers show some talent. The jumper-bred individuals are capable with great technique.
Several breeding societies have lately come under scrutiny for breeding their horses too &quot;hot&quot;. This movement has come about as show jumping has exploded in popularity: sensitive, independent horses, in general, make better show jumpers. However, highly sensitive, independent horses are not suitable for most amateur riders, who make up the majority of the horse-buying market. This is when the importance of the performance test is clearest. The stallions and elite mares are scored on their interior qualities: temperament, character, constitution, and willingness to work, as well as rideability. Therefore, within the Oldenburg Verband, breeders have the tools to choose the route of high-performance horse, or one more suitable for the amateur rider. While a variety of temperaments exist within the population, finding one with the right elements is not difficult.

According to the verband rules, colts are to be named patrilineally, that is, the first letter of the son&#x27;s name is the same as the first letter of the sire&#x27;s name (Dream of Glory by Donnerhall). Fillies are named matrilineally (Fabina out of Fiesta). This practice makes it easy to trace female families.

==Uses==
Unless directly sired by a Thoroughbred, most Oldenburgers are too slow for eventing. All the same, in 2006 the Oldenburg Verband was #11 in the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranking of studbooks with the greatest prevalence in international eventing. One of the earliest Oldenburg horses to reach the highest echelons of sport was Volturno, a black stallion born in 1968, member of the 1976 silver-medal German Olympic eventing team.

Especially with the implementation of the Oldenburg Jumper Studbook in 2001, Oldenburgers have been very successful in the sport of show jumping. Bred to be courageous, cautious, powerful, scopey, and correct over fences, the Oldenburg Verband was #7 in the WBFSH ranking of studbooks in show jumping. Thanks to the likes of 2006 World Cup champion Sandro Boy and Arko III, only the Westphalian, Hanoverian, Dutch Warmblood and jumping-focused Holsteiner, Selle Français, and Belgian Warmblood had stronger showings in international sport.

The Oldenburg has become particularly successful in dressage, owing much of its continued success to sires like Donnerhall and now Sandro Hit, who top the rankings in the production of dressage horses. In 2006, Oldenburgers were the third most successful breed in the dressage ring, with only the Hanoverian and Dutch Warmblood breeds having higher WBFSH standings. Oldenburg horses have competed in Dressage at the Olympics.

<text>In cinematic parlance, a film in its first run has been recently released. In North America, new films attract the majority of their theatrical viewers in the first few weeks after their release. In North America, different movie theatres pay different rates to show films depending on how recently they have been released. In 1946, the Supreme Court of the United States found major film distributors in violation of antitrust laws when they precluded independent theaters from screening first-run films.

Some older, smaller, or poorly outfitted neighborhood or discount theatres, or those in less desirable locations, specialize in showing films during their second run. These theatres get to keep a larger share of the ticket fees and often charge a lower ticket price.

<doc id="1303216" wikidata="Q1502779" url="?curid=1303216" title="GeoServer">
<text>In computing, GeoServer is an open-source server written in Java that allows users to share, process and edit geospatial data. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards. GeoServer has evolved to become an easy method of connecting existing information to virtual globes such as Google Earth and NASA World Wind as well as to web-based maps such as OpenLayers, Leaflet, Google Maps and Bing Maps. GeoServer functions as the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium Web Feature Service standard, and also implements the Web Map Service, Web Coverage Service and Web Processing Service specifications.

== Goals ==
GeoServer aims to operate as a node within a free and open Spatial Data Infrastructure. Just as the Apache HTTP Server has offered a free and open web server to publish HTML, GeoServer aims to do the same for geospatial data.

== Features ==
GeoServer reads a variety of data formats, including:

* PostGIS
* Oracle Spatial
* ArcSDE
* IBM Db2
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* Apache Solr
* Shapefiles
* GeoTIFF
* GTOPO30
* ECW, MrSID
* JPEG2000

Through standard protocols it produces KML, GML, Shapefile, GeoRSS, PDF, GeoJSON, JPEG, GIF, SVG, PNG and more. In addition, one can edit data via the WFS transactional profile (WFS-T). GeoServer includes an integrated OpenLayers client for previewing data layers.

GeoServer additionally supports efficient publishing of geospatial data to Google Earth through the use of network links, using KML. Advanced features for Google Earth output include templates for customized pop-ups, time and height visualizations, and &quot;super-overlays&quot;.

GeoServer relies on GeoTools, a GIS library.

== Usage ==
* MassGIS (Massachusetts state GIS) 
* MACRIS Maps (Massachusetts Historical Commission)
* TriMet (Transit agency for Portland, Oregon)
* Ordnance Survey (National Mapping Agency of the UK)
* Institut Géographique National (National Mapping Agency of France)
* GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
* World Bank
* Global Earthquake Model
* GMOS (Global Mercury Observation System)
* FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)
* New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications
* TeamSurv
* ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

== Architecture ==
GeoServer uses the Spring Framework, providing a request dispatch architecture for modules implementing OGC services. The web administration application uses wicket, allowing extensions to contribute additional configuration screens. The application provides a REST API implemented using the spring-mvc-framework.

GeoServer is a web application, supporting any common servlet container (a standalone distribution is available with the Jetty (web server) as an embedded server). GeoWebCache, a Java-based caching component similar to TileCache, is bundled with GeoServer, but available separately. Similarly, GeoServer packages GeoTools as a Java library, but it is also available separately.

GeoServer is a longstanding application and has undergone several architectural changes. GeoServer 1.0 was built around the STRUTS framework, with the migration to Spring and Wicket taking place for GeoServer 2.0. Early versions of the REST API used restlet before migration to spring-mvc-framework.

<doc id="1303217" wikidata="Q7424210" url="?curid=1303217" title="Sarkic">
<text>Sarkic (Greek &quot;σάρξ&quot;, flesh or hylic, from the Greek &quot;ὕλη&quot;, stuff, or matter) in Gnosticism describes the lowest level of human nature—the fleshly, instinctive level. This is not the notion of body as opposed to thought; rather the sarkic level is said to be the lowest level of thought.

== Concepts ==
The concept of sarkic is used along with &quot;pneuma&quot;, which refers to spirit or soul, to describe the duality of Christ and also the Christian Church. Furthermore, such duality is used to explain the paradox of the identities of Adam and Eve. 

There are thinkers such as Maximus the Confessor who associate sarkic (fleshly) with the somatic dimension (bodily) of human nature, the area where redemption must occur. There are, however, instances when they are considered near equivalent. But these states needed to be transcended to achieve a form of existence characterized by a heightened communion with God.

Sarkic is also used in Christian terms such as Paul&#x27;s description of Abraham&#x27;s children as &quot;sarkic&quot; children who have the &quot;pneuma&quot; of Christ. In his classification of humanity in his attempt to address the so-called &quot;gentile problem&quot;, he labeled all as &quot;sarkic&quot;: &quot;sarkic&quot; Jews who have Christ&#x27;s &quot;pneuma&quot;; &quot;sarkic&quot; Jews who lack Christ&#x27;s &quot;pneuma&quot;; &quot;sarkic&quot; gentiles who have Christ&#x27;s &quot;pneuma&quot;; and, &quot;sarkic&quot; gentiles who lack Christ&#x27;s &quot;pneuma&quot;. 

Paul also linked sarkic to the concept of &quot;hamartia&quot;, with the former serving as the force of the latter, capable of overcoming individual action and will.

=== Popular culture ===
Sarkicism is a religion documented in SCP Foundation entries.

<doc id="1303219" wikidata="Q3952336" url="?curid=1303219" title="Holism in science">
<text>Holism in science, holistic science, or methodological holism is an approach to research that emphasizes the study of complex systems. Systems are approached as coherent wholes whose component parts are best understood in context and in relation to both each other and to the whole. Holism typically stands in contrast with reductionism, which describes systems by dividing them into smaller components in order to understand them through their elemental properties.

The holism-individualism dichotomy is especially evident in conflicting interpretations of experimental findings across the social sciences, and reflects whether behavioural analysis begins at the systemic, macro-level (ie. derived from social relations) or the component micro-level (ie. derived from individual agents).

== Overview ==

David Deutsch calls holism anti-reductionist and refers to the concept of thinking as the only legitimate way to think about science in as a series of emergent, or higher level phenomena. He argues that neither approach is purely correct.

Two aspects of Holism are:

# The way of doing science, sometimes called &quot;whole to parts&quot;, which focuses on observation of the specimen within its ecosystem first before breaking down to study any part of the specimen.
# The idea that the scientist is not a passive observer of an external universe but rather a participant in the system.

Proponents claim that Holistic science is naturally suited to subjects such as ecology, biology, physics and the social sciences, where complex, non-linear interactions are the norm. These are systems where emergent properties arise at the level of the whole that cannot be predicted by focusing on the parts alone, which may make mainstream, reductionist science ill-equipped to provide understanding beyond a certain level. This principle of emergence in complex systems is often captured in the phrase ′the whole is greater than the sum of its parts′. Living organisms are an example: no knowledge of all the chemical and physical properties of matter can explain or predict the functioning of living organisms. The same happens in complex social human systems, where detailed understanding of individual behaviour cannot predict the behaviour of the group, which emerges at the level of the collective. The phenomenon of emergence may impose a theoretical limit on knowledge available through reductionist methodology, arguably making complex systems natural subjects for holistic approaches.

Science journalist John Horgan has expressed this view in the book &quot;The End of Science&quot;. He wrote that a certain pervasive model within holistic science, self-organized criticality, for example, &quot;is not really a theory at all. Like punctuated equilibrium, self-organized criticality is merely a description, one of many, of the random fluctuations, the noise, permeating nature.&quot; By the theorists&#x27; own admissions, he said, such a model &quot;can generate neither specific predictions about nature nor meaningful insights. What good is it, then?&quot;

One of the reasons that holistic science attracts supporters is that it seems to offer a progressive, &#x27;socio-ecological&#x27; view of the world, but Alan Marshall&#x27;s book &quot;The Unity of Nature&quot; offers evidence to the contrary; suggesting holism in science is not &#x27;ecological&#x27; or &#x27;socially-responsive&#x27; at all, but regressive and repressive.

== Examples in various fields of science ==

=== Physical science ===

==== Agriculture ====
Permaculture takes a systems level approach to agriculture and land management by attempting to copy what happens in the natural world. Holistic management integrates ecology and social sciences with food production. It was originally designed as a way to reverse desertification. Organic farming is sometimes considered a holistic approach.

==== In physics ====
Richard Healey offered a modal interpretation and used it to present a model account of the puzzling correlations which portrays them as resulting from the operation of a process that violates both spatial and spatiotemporal separability. He argued that, on this interpretation, the nonseparability of the process is a consequence of physical property holism; and that the resulting account yields genuine understanding of how the correlations come about without any violation of relativity theory or Local Action. Subsequent work by Clifton, Dickson and Myrvold cast doubt on whether the account can be squared with relativity theory’s requirement of Lorentz invariance but leaves no doubt of an spatially entangled holism in the theory. Paul Davies and John Gribbin further observe that Wheeler&#x27;s delayed choice experiment shows how the quantum world displays a sort of holism in time as well as space.

In the holistic approach of David Bohm, any collection of quantum objects constitutes an indivisible whole within an implicate and explicate order. Bohm said there is no scientific evidence to support the dominant view that the universe consists of a huge, finite number of minute particles, and offered instead a view of undivided wholeness: &quot;ultimately, the entire universe (with all its &#x27;particles&#x27;, including those constituting human beings, their laboratories, observing instruments, etc.) has to be understood as a single undivided whole, in which analysis into separately and independently existent parts has no fundamental status&quot;.

==== Chaos and complexity ====
Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be computationally irreducible, which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare &quot;surprises&quot; in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.

==== Ecology ====
Holistic thinking can be applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.

==== Medicine ====
In primary care the term &quot;holistic,&quot; has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements. The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in psychosomatic medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from psyche to soma, or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively. At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.

The term systems medicine first appeared in 1992 and takes an integrative approach to all of the body and environment.

=== Social science ===

==== Economics ====
Some economists use a causal holism theory in their work. That is they view the discipline in the manner of Ludwig Wittgenstein and claim that it can&#x27;t be defined by necessary and sufficient conditions.

==== Education reform ====
The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which it is claimed may be used to create a more holistic education. In authentic assessment, rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a standards based assessment uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods. In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether &quot;as a whole&quot; is it more a &quot;2&quot; or a &quot;3&quot;. Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.

==== Anthropology ====
Anthropology is holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.) Further, many academic programs following this approach take a &quot;four-field&quot; approach to anthropology that encompasses physical anthropology, archeology, linguistics, and cultural anthropology or social anthropology.

Some anthropologists disagree, and consider holism to be an artifact from 19th century social evolutionary thought that inappropriately imposes scientific positivism upon cultural anthropology.

The term &quot;holism&quot; is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to a methodological analysis of a society as a whole, in which component parts are treated as functionally relative to each other. One definition says: &quot;as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies.&quot;

==== Psychology of perception ====
A major holist movement in the early twentieth century was gestalt psychology. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic sense data but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included Wolfgang Koehler, Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. Karl Lashley did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on Fritz Perls&#x27; gestalt therapy, although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and New Age trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. Aron Gurwitsch wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. Maurice Merleau-Ponty made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of Kurt Goldstein in his &quot;Phenomenology of Perception.&quot;

==== Teleological psychology ====
Alfred Adler believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, fictional final goal), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler&#x27;s philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

Edgar Morin, the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the transdisciplinary nature of his work.

== Skeptical reception ==

According to skeptics, the phrase &quot;holistic science&quot; is often misused by pseudosciences. In the book &quot;Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology&quot; it&#x27;s noted that &quot;Proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, and mental health, often resort to the &quot;mantra of holism&quot; to explain away negative findings. When invoking the mantra, they typically maintain that scientific claims can be evaluated only within the context of broader claims and therefore cannot be evaluated in isolation.&quot; This is an invocation of Karl Popper&#x27;s demarcation problem and in a posting to &quot;Ask a Philosopher&quot; Massimo Pigliucci clarifies Popper by positing, &quot;Instead of thinking of science as making progress by inductive generalization (which doesn’t work because no matter how many times a given theory may have been confirmed thus far, it is always possible that new, contrary, data will emerge tomorrow), we should say that science makes progress by conclusively disconfirming theories that are, in fact, wrong.&quot;

Victor J. Stenger states that &quot;holistic healing is associated with the rejection of classical, Newtonian physics. Yet, holistic healing retains many ideas from eighteenth and nineteenth century physics. Its proponents are blissfully unaware that these ideas, especially superluminal holism, have been rejected by modern physics as well&quot;.

Some quantum mystics interpret the wave function of quantum mechanics as a vibration in a holistic ether that pervades the universe and wave function collapse as the result of some cosmic consciousness. This is a misinterpretation of the effects of quantum entanglement as a violation of relativistic causality and quantum field theory.

<text>Oleg Alexandrovich Maskaev (; born 2 March 1969) is a Kazakhstani-born former professional boxer of Mordvinian origin, who competed from 1995 to 2013, and held the WBC heavyweight title from 2006 to 2008. Throughout his career, he represented Soviet Union, Uzbekistan, United States and Russia.

==Biography==
His father is Moksha from the Zubova Polyana district of Mordovia and mother is Ukrainian from Kuban, Southern Russia.

==Amateur career==
Maskayev, a former mine worker, began his boxing career in the 1980s as an amateur in his hometown Abay. In 1991 he stopped future WBC world champion Vitali Klitschko in the second round.

Maskayev was the champion of the Soviet Army and later the national cup winner. First he represented Soviet Union and subsequently Uzbekistan. Representing Uzbekistan he won a gold medal at the 1994 Asian Games.

=== Highlights ===

Maskayev resumed the amateur career within a month after his reported professional debut in April 1993, to participate in the 1993 World Championships, &#x27;94 World Cup, and &#x27;94 Asian Games, with the last ones ended with a gold medal for him.

Maskayev finished his amateur career having 118 fights under his belt, with a stated record of 108–10. Controversy later arose as to his record, before he fought Oliver McCall, USBA stated his professional record 15–0 (12 KOs,) which was confirmed &quot;ex officio&quot; by the Virginia Boxing Commission (which sanctioned the Maskayev–McCall event and all subsequent official information related to it, including the records,) while later and supposedly more precise estimates gave 6–0 (3 KOs.) Nine missing bouts in given record were either unaccounted for (and therefore non-sanctioned events,) or considered as amateur, or exhibition fights. No data available presently for that missing part of Maskayev&#x27;s early professional career.

==Professional career==
Maskaev&#x27;s professional boxing career began in 1993. Not wasting any time, he made his professional debut against 21–0 (15) former bronze medalist Alexander Miroshnichenko. Maskaev won via third-round TKO. In only his seventh professional bout, Maskaev was faced off against Oliver McCall, who had captured a world heavyweight title by knocking out Lennox Lewis only a year before. Maskaev was caught with a hard left hand to the body, followed up with a short right hand in the first round, losing via TKO and being handed his first professional defeat. After winning his next four, Maskaev fought hard-hitting Samoan David Tua. Maskayev lost via 11th-round TKO.

Oleg is known for his powerful right-hand punch: he has knocked out former WBO heavyweight challenger Derrick Jefferson, contender Alex Stewart, and twice knocked out former WBC heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman. However, he is also noted for a weak chin that was evident in his knockout losses to contenders Oliver McCall, David Tua, Kirk Johnson, Lance Whitaker, Corey Sanders and journeyman Nagy Aguilera.

His most famous victories have been his two wins over Hasim Rahman. Maskaev knocked Rahman off balance, sending his rival out of the ring in the 8th round on November 6, 1999. This fight is also notable for the famous &quot;chair incident&quot;, in which noted referee, Steve Smoger, who was backup referee for this fight, was struck in the head by a chair thrown by a fan who was later arrested.
He later fought Rahman again and defeated him for the WBC heavyweight title by knocking him out in the 12th round on August 12, 2006. His second win over Rahman was preceded by a streak of victories that helped rejuvenate Maskaev&#x27;s career and earned him the &quot;Comeback fighter of the Year&quot; award in The Ring magazine in 2006.

Maskaev won his first title defense against Peter Okhello on December 10, 2006 by unanimous decision.

Maskaev fought against Samuel Peter for the WBC Heavyweight title on March 8, 2008 and was doing well in the early rounds, despite Peter&#x27;s repeated rabbit punching and the referee&#x27;s warnings. In the 5th round Maskaev landed some of his best shots on his opponents chin, but to no avail: Peter was seemingly unaffected, visibly shaking Oleg. He lost 5 of the 6 rounds, with Peter winning by TKO with 3 seconds remaining in the sixth round.

In late 2008 he beat opponent Robert Hawkins by UD after 10 rounds and then defeated the unheralded Rich Boruff on March 14, 2009 via first-round KO, giving him mandatory contender status to the WBC Heavyweight Championship. He fought Nagy Aguilera on December 11 in Sacramento, California at the Memorial Auditorium in a tune up fight, but was knocked out in the first round. Getting stunned with an overhand right-left hook combo and knocked down soon after, another barrage by Aquilera hit Maskaev hard knocking him out.
Maskaev did not land a punch in the fight, and has since stated that he may retire following the loss, however he returned to the ring 3 years after the loss, to knock out Owen Beck. In 2013, he decisioned Jason Gavern in a 10-round fight.

==Nationality==
Maskayev was born in Taraz, Kazakhstan (then part of the USSR) to Mordvin-Ukrainian parents and was raised in Uzbekistan. He has lived in the U.S. since 1999 with his wife, Svetlana, and four daughters. He acquired US citizenship in 2004. He currently resides in West Sacramento, California, after previously living in Staten Island, New York. Before his second encounter with Hasim Rahman in 2006, he said &quot;I would say I&#x27;m a proud Russian-American. So right now, I&#x27;m a citizen of America, of [the] United States... Whoever is going to win is going to be American.&quot;
In the run-up to his title defense against Peter Okhello, he stated regarding his citizenship: &quot;Russian. I don&#x27;t want to talk about that anymore. I will walk to the ring under the Russian flag and Russian anthem as I&#x27;m now a Russian citizen.&quot;
Russian president Vladimir Putin granted him Russian citizenship on December 9, 2006.

<text>Water privatization is short for private sector participations in the provision of water services and sanitation. Water privatization has a variable history in which its popularity and favorability has fluctuated in the market and politics. One of the common forms of privatization is public–private partnerships (PPPs). PPPs allow for a mix between public and private ownership and/or management of water and sanitation sources and infrastructure. Privatization, as proponents argue, may not only increase efficiency and service quality but also increase fiscal benefits. There are different forms of regulation in place for current privatization systems.

Private sector participation in water supply and sanitation is controversial. Proponents of private sector participation argue that it has led to improvements in the efficiency and service quality of utilities. It is argued that it has increased investment and has contributed to expanded access. They cite Manila, Guayaquil in Ecuador, Bucharest, several cities in Colombia and Morocco, as well as Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Senegal as success stories. Critics, however, contend that private sector participation led to tariff increases, and privatized water systems are incompatible with ensuring the international human right to water, with the belief that public water will no longer be public. Aborted privatizations in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania, as well as privately managed water systems in Jakarta and Berlin, are highlighted as failures. In 2019, Austria forbade the privatization of water provision via its constitution. Water privatization in Buenos Aires, Argentina and in England are cited by both supporters and opponents, each emphasizing different aspects of these cases.

Figures outlining the accessibility of water from the private sector also display the controversy of private water sources: one source claims that 909 million people were served by &quot;private players&quot; in 2011 globally, up from 681 million people in 2007. This figure includes people served by publicly owned companies that have merely outsourced the financing, construction, and operation of part of their assets, such as water or wastewater treatment plants, to the private sector. The World Bank estimated the urban population directly served by private water operators in developing countries to be much lower at 170 million in 2007. Among them, only about 15 million people, all living in Chile, are served by privately owned utilities. Privately managed but publicly owned companies serve the remainder under concession, lease, and management contracts.

==History==

Privately owned water utilities were common in Europe, the United States, and Latin America in the mid and late 19th century. Their importance gradually faded away until the early 20th century as they proved unable to expand access and publicly owned utilities became stronger. A second global dawn of private water utilities came in the early 1990s in the aftermath of the Thatcher privatizations in England and Wales, the fall of communism and the ensuing global emphasis on free market policies. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund played an important role in this process through the conditionality of their lending.

In England and Wales, the emergence of the first private water companies dates back to the 17th century. In 1820, six private water companies operated in London. However, the market share of private water companies in London declined from 40% in 1860 to 10% in 1900. In the 1980s, their share all over England and Wales was about 25%. The tide turned completely in 1989 when the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher privatized all public water and sewer companies in England and Wales. In Scotland local governments dominated by the Labour party kept water systems in public hands.
Meanwhile, the water sector in France has always been characterized by a coexistence of public and private management, with their respective shares fluctuating over time. The two largest private companies are Veolia Environnement, formerly the Compagnie Générale des Eaux and then Vivendi Environnement, and Suez Environnement, formerly Lyonnaise des Eaux and then Ondeo. The Compagnie Générale des Eaux was founded in 1853 and Lyonnaise des Eaux in 1880. In the late 19th century, municipal governments, dissatisfied with high tariffs and the lack of expansion of networks to poor neighborhoods, did not renew private concessions and created instead municipally owned utilities. The share of private water operators declined to 17% in 1936. The share of the private sector gradually increased to 32% in 1954, 50% in 1975, and 80% in 2000 using a new model. Instead of the concession contracts, which gave the responsibility to finance investments to the private company, the new lease contracts (&quot;affermages&quot;) made the private operator only responsible for operation and maintenance, while major investments became a responsibility of the municipalities. The French water companies also escaped the nationalizations after the war and later under President François Mitterrand, because the central government did not want to interfere with the autonomy of municipalities and was unwilling to finance heavy investments. The water supply of Paris was privatized in 1985 when a conservative mayor awarded two lease contracts, each covering one half of the city. In 2010, a socialist mayor remunicipalized the water system of the French capital.
In Spain, private water companies maintained their position, budging the global trend during the late 19th and early 20th century. The largest private water company in Spain is Aguas de Barcelona. Initially created by French and Belgian investors, it was sold to Spanish investors in 1920, only to gradually come back under French control in the early 21st century.

In Germany, a British private water company had set up the first piped water system and treatment plant in Berlin in 1852, but the city, dissatisfied with the lack of investment in particular in sewerage, cancelled the contract in 1873. In 1887 Gelsenwasser was created, which remains an important regional water supplier in the Ruhr district. The German water sector has always been dominated by municipally owned utilities. Despite this, the water system of Berlin was partially privatized in 1999 for fiscal reasons.

In the United States, 60% of piped water systems were privately owned in 1850. However, this share declined to 30% in 1924. As of 2010, 2000 water and wastewater facilities in the U.S. were operated under public-private partnerships, a joint effort between the private group and the municipality it was operating in.

In Chile, the Pinochet dictatorship established 1980 Constitution including the water laws that is a foundation of Chile&#x27;s water systems. Additionally, the government enacted the 1981 Water Code, a legal regime that decide to eliminate the government involvement in controlling water system and allow citizens to possess rights to exploit water resources. Establishing this Water Code, the Chile&#x27;s government achieved the water privatization, and this regime is still in force. Today, the government has reduced its power in water resources administration; therefore, 90% of the Chile&#x27;s drinking water supply is controlled by the transnational corporations. However, this water system causes the imbalance of Chile&#x27;s distribution of water rights. For example, since Water Code permits companies&#x27; to exploit water resources, 71% of Chile&#x27;s water resources are utilized in irrigation which is equivalent to the annual consumption of 243 millions homes. The inequal distribution of water rights induces the scarcity of Chilean citizens&#x27; water resources, particularly in the drought.
European and local private water companies expanded in Latin America, Africa, and Asia in the second half of the 19th century, all while their importance declined in Europe. In Uruguay, water supply was privately managed from 1867 to 1950; in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a brief period from 1887 to 1891 and again from 1993 to 2006; in Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt, from 1867 to 1956; in Beirut, Lebanon, from the 19th century until 1951; in Shanghai, China, from 1875 to 1949; in Casablanca, Morocco, from 1914 to 1962 and then again after 1997; in Senegal until 1971 and then again after 1996; and in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire from colonial times until today without interruption.

In Central and Eastern Europe, private companies expanded during the late 1990s, especially in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.

However, some water privatizations failed, most notably in 2000 in Cochabamba, Bolivia, paving the way for a new pragmatism and a reduced emphasis on privatization, and in 2019, Austria forbid the privatization of water provision via its constitution.

==Forms of privatization==
Broadly speaking, there are two forms of private sector participation in water supply and sanitation. In a &quot;full privatization&quot;, assets are permanently sold to a private investor. In a &quot;public-private partnership&quot;, ownership of assets remains public and only certain functions are delegated to a private company for a specific period. Full privatization of water supply and sanitation is an exception today, being limited to England, Chile and some cities in the United States. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are the most common form of private sector participation in water supply and sanitation today.

The three most common forms of PPPs, in the order of increasing responsibilities for the private partner, are:
* a management contract, under which the private operator is only responsible for running the system, in exchange for a fee that is to some extent performance-related. Investment is financed and carried out by the public sector. The duration is typically 4–7 years.
* a lease contract, under which assets are leased to the private operator who receives a share of revenues. It thus typically bears a higher commercial risk than under a management contract. Investment is fully or mostly financed and carried out by the public sector. The duration is typically 10–15 years.
* a mixed-ownership company in which a private investor takes a minority share in a water company with full management responsibility vested in the private partner.
* a concession, under which the private operator is responsible for running the entire system. Investment is mostly or fully financed and carried out by the private operator. The duration is typically 20–30 years.

Concessions are the most common form of PPPs in water supply and sanitation. They are followed by leases, also called &quot;affermages&quot;, most commonly used in France and Francophone West Africa. Management contracts are used in Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Armenia, among others. Mixed-ownership companies are most common in Spain, Colombia, and Mexico.

A concession for the construction of a new plant is called a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract. Under a BOT contract the private operator signs an agreement with a utility that purchases treated water or wastewater treatment services.

==Motives==

The motives for water privatization vary from one case to another, and they often determine which mode of privatization is chosen: management and lease contracts are used to increase efficiency and improve service quality while asset sales and concessions primarily aim to reduce the financial burden or to expand access. Ideological motives and external influences also play a role, with market-liberal ideology favoring privatization, left-leaning ideologies opposing, and both conservatives and centrists falling in between, often based on local and business-minded considerations. Usually, several of the above motives are combined.

===Increasing efficiency and improving service quality===
Water privatization is seen by some as a solution to improving poorly managed public water utility systems. Symptoms of poor management can include low water bill collection, high water losses (known as non-revenue water), and intermittent water supply, sometimes lasting only for a few hours a day or a few days per week. In Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Colombia and Cuba increasing efficiency and improving service quality were principal motives for water privatization. In these cases, the argument to privatize water is predicated on the belief that by adopting a market-based approach to the management of water, the service provider will be incentivized by profit to increase efficiency and improve service quality. Some critics argue that this belief is misguided because the water utility sector is typically monopolized by one private company. They claim that this counteracts many of the advantages associated with the market economy because without competition between multiple water service businesses there is nothing to drive prices down and levels of efficiency up.

===External influences===
External influences, such as from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), often play a role in the decision of governments to privatize water, as was the case in Bolivia and in several African countries. This influence may take the form of structural adjustment programs, whereby a development loan is given on the condition that the receiving country privatize their water utility system. Other aid agencies have also supported water privatization. These include the Inter-American Development Bank (e.g., in Ecuador, Colombia and Honduras), the Asian Development Bank (e.g., in China), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe, German development cooperation through KfW (e.g., in Albania, Armenia, Jordan and Peru), French development cooperation (e.g., in Senegal) and British development cooperation (e.g., in Tanzania and Guyana). Critics claim that these external influences are problematic and argue that influencing water privatization is part of a broader movement of Western powers imposing neoliberalism on countries in the Global South. In the UK, the World Development Movement campaigned against the support of water privatization through aid from the UK.

===Financial motives===
In some cases, where access is already universal and service quality is good, financial motives dominate, as it was the case in Berlin, Germany, and in Chile. In Berlin the state government sold a 49.9% share of its water utility in 1999 for 1.69bn Euros in exchange for a guaranteed profit for the private shareholders amounting to the interest rate on 10-year government bonds plus 2 percent, as specified in a contract that was kept confidential until the state government was forced by a referendum to make it public. As a result, tariffs increased (15% in 2004 alone) and the state government&#x27;s revenues from the company declined compared to the situation before privatization (168m Euro profit for the state in 1997 compared to a 10m Euro loss in 2003). In Chile, where no wastewater treatment plants existed prior to privatization, the government&#x27;s desire to finance their construction off-budget drove privatization in 1998.

Financial motives for water privatization are also common in countries where water access and service quality is poor. In cities with rapidly growing slums, it is very expensive for the government to expand their water utility system infrastructure at the pace of the growing population. Furthermore, maintaining the good condition of old infrastructure is also expensive. Thus, if a significant portion of public funds is not allocated to maintenance, pipes and waste water treatment plants can fall into disrepair. For some countries, the cost of managing a public water utility system becomes unaffordable. In these cases, privatization can be seen as a possible solution for governments to attract national and international private investment.

==Prevalence==

===Prevalence of public-private partnerships===

There are widely differing estimates of the number of people served by private water companies. The World Bank estimated that, as of 2007, about 270 million people received water from private companies in more than 40 countries, including about 160 million in developed countries and 110 million in developing countries. However, the report did not include estimates of the number of people served by private companies on the wastewater side.

The Pinsent Masons Water Yearbook uses a broader definition including also wastewater services. More importantly, it also includes cases where a water or wastewater treatment plant is operated by a private company on behalf of a publicly owned and operated utility that serves the final customer. On the basis of this broader definition and taking into account the growth of both population and water privatization between 2007 and 2011, it estimates that 909 million in 62 countries or 13% of the world population were served by the private sector in one form or another. This includes 309 million people in China, 61 million in the United States, 60 million in Brazil, 46 million in France, 23 million in Spain, 15 million in India and 14 million in Russia. In England and Wales the entire population of 55 million is served by private companies. In addition, in Chile, the Czech Republic, Armenia, and three African countries – Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Gabon and Senegal – private companies provide water services to the entire urban population. In Hungary, they serve almost half the population. In Algeria, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, and South Africa less than half the population is served by private companies. In the Philippines, Indonesia, Bulgaria, Estonia, and Cuba, private water companies serve only the capital city.

24 countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Ghana and the Central African Republic, had reverted to public management as of 2009. However, 84 percent of contracts awarded mostly in the 1990s were still active.

On the other hand, in many countries, such as in Japan, Canada, Egypt, Pakistan, or Scandinavia, there are no private water companies. Nicaragua, the Netherlands, and Uruguay have even passed laws banning water privatization. In Italy, in June 2011 a law favoring water privatization was repealed by an overwhelming majority of Italians through a referendum. In 2019, the City of Baltimore, Maryland became the first major city in the United States to ban water privatization.


A World Bank report lists the following examples of successful public-private partnerships in developing countries: the full privatization in Chile; the mixed companies in Colombia; the concessions in Guayaquil in Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Eastern Manila in the Philippines, Morocco, and Gabun; and the lease contracts in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Senegal, and Yerevan in Armenia.

===Small-scale operators: the other private sector===

Beyond water privatization, which involves contractual relationships between a government and formally established large companies, there is also &quot;the other private sector&quot; in water supply consisting of small-scale, often informal local operators. They exist in most cities in the Global South and sometimes provide a large portion of the city&#x27;s population with water. For example, a study of six Latin American countries showed that they provide water to 25% of the population in seven cities. In Africa, they serve an estimated 50% of the urban population. They mainly operate in slums, serving the people who are not catered to by the city authorities. Many small-scale water operators provide water through tanker trucks or animal-drawn carts. Others operate water distribution networks fed by wells, as it is the case in Asunción, Paraguay, and in Sanaa, Yemen. Small-scale operators can be owned by individual entrepreneurs or can take the form of cooperatives, as it is the case in Honduras. Small-scale operators do not always comply with technical norms and the quality of the water they provide or their tariffs are often not regulated. More often than not, their tariffs are significantly higher than those of public water utilities. This can attributed to either profiteering or simply the high transportation costs expended during the distribution of water. They typically lack capital to further expand their network. However, in a few pilot cases – such as in Kenya, Uganda, Cambodia and Vietnam – international aid agencies have provided them with grants to increase access, often in the form of output-based aid.

==Selecting private operators==
Private companies are typically selected through international competitive bidding and need to have demonstrated previous experience. Selection is either done through a combination of price and quality, or solely based on price. In the case of a management contract, the price is the management fee (fixed fee plus performance-based fee); in the case of a lease it is the lease fee per unit of water sold; in a concession it is the water tariff; and in an asset sale it is the price paid for the company. In some cases – such as in Casablanca in 1997 and in Jakarta in 1998 – private companies have been selected through direct negotiations without competitive bidding. In other cases – such as in Cartagena (Colombia) in 1995, Cochabamba (Bolivia) in 1999 and Guayaquil (Ecuador) in 2000 – only a single bid was submitted. If development aid agencies are involved in directly financing private sector participation, they systematically require competitive bidding. However, in some cases – such as in Timişoara, Romania – the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has financed parallel investments, while a concession was awarded by the government after direct negotiations.

==Forms of regulation==
Being monopolies, all water utilities – public or private – need to be regulated concerning tariff approvals, service quality, environmental compliance and other aspects. The awareness for the need to regulate typically increases substantially when profit-oriented private operators become involved: Monitoring the performance of both the private and the public partner, applying sanctions in case of non-compliance and dispute resolution become particularly important. The regulatory tasks depend on the form of private sector participation: Under a management contract the monitoring of the achievement of performance standards, on which the remuneration of the private company depends, is typically carried out by an independent consulting firm. Under a concession contract or in the case of an asset sale, tariff regulation through a regulatory agency or the government is a key regulatory function. Water concessions are frequently renegotiated, often resulting in better terms for the private company. For example, negotiations of concessions in Buenos Aires and Manila resulted in investment requirements being reduced, tariffs being increased and tariffs being indexed to the exchange rate to the US dollar. The quality and strength of regulation is an important factor that influences whether water privatization fails or succeeds. The tasks, form and capacity of the public entities charged with regulation vary greatly between countries.

Globally, regulation of private water companies is being carried out by the following types of public entities or, sometimes, a combination of them.

==Examples of privatization==
The best-known examples of water privatization in the late 20th century are those undertaken in England under Margaret Thatcher, the Manila and Buenos Aires concessions as well as the failed privatization in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which became a symbol of the struggle against globalization. Less well known, but just as relevant, are water privatizations in other countries, such as in Colombia.

===France===

Private water firms have had a dominant role in France for more than a century. Private water firms (Veolia Water, Suez Environnement and smaller peers such as Saur) control 60 percent of France&#x27;s water market. Veolia and Suez are the world&#x27;s largest private international water and wastewater firms.

Water privatization in France has been going on from before the 1800s but only recently, around the 1960s, has it grown in size and power. In the 20 years between the 1950s and 1970s it is estimated that the private water sector increased its share of potable water supply by at least 20%, a figure that has increased to around 75% in the current present. The water supply is now owned by three major companies. In the 3600 local municipalities in France each of them has the power to decide whether or not they publicize or privatize drinking water and dictate the terms of the contract.

The funding of French Water Agencies is completely done in by themselves. Meaning that these companies are self-funded. The total revenue is hard to estimate but from 1992 to 1996 around 81 Billion French Francs were held in revenue by these Water Agencies. This large fund is mostly used to expand and maintain public and private water projects. This model, although very profitable, lacks economic regulation due to poor logistics. This is a problem which is in the process of being fixed by implementing a clear and well-defined contract between the Water Agencies and the contractors who build the infrastructure.

===England and Wales===

In England and Wales, water tariffs, water company debt, water company dividends and profits increased substantially after privatization in 1989, but investments also increased and water quality in rivers improved. Tariffs increased by 46% in inflation-adjusted terms during the first nine years after privatization. Operating profits have more than doubled (+142%) in the first eight years. From privatisation in 1989 to December 2023, water company debt has increased by £60.3bn, during which time £53bn has been paid out in dividends. On the other hand, privatization increased investments: In the six years after privatization the companies invested £17 billion, compared to £9.3 billion in the six years before privatization. It also brought about compliance with stringent drinking water standards and led to a higher quality of river water. According to data from OFWAT, the economic regulator of water and sewer companies in England and Wales, from the early 1990s until 2010, network pressure has improved substantially, supply interruptions have become less frequent, the responsiveness to complaints has improved and leakage has been reduced.

In the 1980s the elite largely believed that the state was not building infrastructure for water in a manner that would allow the economy to grow appropriately. For this reason, the economic and political powerful spearhead a shift towards making water a privately owned utility. Recently, the entire privatized water systems have been undergoing a complete restructuring. Small water companies in the UK have also been purchased by multinational companies from the United States, France and Scotland. The privately owned companies have been found to have trouble with water quality, environment pollution, sewage management, leakage and logistical errors.

===Manila, the Philippines===
Water privatization in Manila began in 1997 with the award of two concession contracts for the Eastern and Western halves of Metro Manila. The concessions represent the largest population served by private operators in the developing world. As of 2010, the concession in Eastern Manila is highly successful and has led to significant improvements in access, service quality and efficiency: the population served more than doubled from 3 in 1997 to 6.1 million in 2009, the share of customers with continuous water supply increased from 26% to more than 98% and non-revenue water declined from 63% to 16%. The concession in Western Manila failed when the company Maynilad went bankrupt in 2003. It was sold to new investors in 2007 and performance has improved since then. The share of the population with access to piped water in Western Manila increased from 67% in 1997 to 86% in 2006 and the share of customers that enjoys 24-hour water supply increased from 32% in 2007 to 71% in early 2011.

===Argentina===
Water privatization in Argentina began in 1992 under the government of Carlos Menem as part of one of the world&#x27;s largest privatization programs. Concessions were signed in 28% of the country&#x27;s municipalities covering 60% of the population, including in 1993 for the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. After the 2001 economic crisis, under the government of Néstor Kirchner, almost all concessions were terminated, including in Buenos Aires in 2006. The impact of the concession remains controversial. The government and critics argue that the concessionaire failed to achieve the targets set under the concession contract in terms of expansion of access, investment and service quality. Proponents concede that targets were not reached, but argue that a freeze in tariffs at the time of the devaluation of the Peso during the Argentinian economic crisis in 2001 violated the contract and thus made it impossible to achieve the original targets. According to the Argentinian economist Sebastian Galiani, the public company OSN had invested only US$25m per year between 1983 and 1993, while the private concessionaire Aguas Argentinas increased investments to around US$200m per year between 1993 and 2000. According to the private concessionnaire Suez, during the 13-year-duration of its concession it extended access to water to 2 million people and access to sanitation to 1 million people, despite the economic crisis. In July 2010 the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled that the Argentinian government unfairly refused to allow the private concessionaires to raise tariffs during the period after the devaluation of the Argentine peso in 2001 and that the private companies are entitled to damages. The private companies announced that they would seek US$1.2bn in damages.

===Cochabamba, Bolivia===
In the mid-1990s the government of Bolivia, under pressure from the World Bank, decided to privatize water supply in the country&#x27;s third largest city, Cochabamba. In the previous years, despite encumbered funds made available by the World Bank to support the public utility of Cochabamba, access to piped water in the city had decreased to 40%. Water losses had remained high at 40%, and water was supplied only 4 hours a day. Those not connected to the network paid ten times as much for their water to private vendors as those who were. This contrasted with the situation in Bolivia&#x27;s second-largest city, Santa Cruz, where a utility run as a cooperative had managed to increase access and improve service quality with the support of the World Bank. In Santa Cruz, privatization had never been considered.

In 1997, a first bid for a water concession in Cochabamba had been declared void at the request of the mayor of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa. He wanted the construction of a large dam, the Misicuni dam, and a pipeline from the dam to the city to be included in the concession. The World Bank had opposed the dam as unnecessarily expensive and subsequently ended its involvement related to water supply in the city. Despite this, in the view of the public the World Bank remains inseparably linked to the Cochabamba privatization.

The government proceeded to bid out the concession; this time including the Misicuni dam. Only a single company submitted a bid, &quot;Aguas del Tunari&quot;, a consortium led by Bechtel. The government accepted the bid and signed the concession. The consortium was guaranteed a minimum 15% annual return. In parallel, a law was passed that appeared to give a monopoly to &quot;Aguas del Tunari&quot; over all water resources, including water used for irrigation, communal water systems and even rainwater collected on roofs. Upon taking control the company raised water tariffs by 35%.

Demonstrations and a general strike erupted in January 2000 in protest against the tariff increase and the perceived privatization of water resources. The government arrested the leader of the protesters, Oscar Olivera. However, the protests spread to the entire country and the government declared a state of emergency in April. Protests still continued and several people were killed. In the midst of the turmoil the employees of &quot;Aguas del Tunari&quot; fled from Cochabamba. The government finally released Oscar Olivera and signed an agreement with him stating that the concession would be ended. The government then told &quot;Aguas del Tunari&quot; that by leaving Cochabamba they had abandoned the concession and parliament revoked Law 2029. The Cochabamba protests became a worldwide symbol of struggle against neoliberalism and the Cochabamba privatization is probably, both among activists against globalization and the general public, by far the best known example of the failure of water privatization.

The company, insisting that it had been forced out, filed a $25 million lawsuit in the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The proceedings, which were held behind closed doors, ended in 2006 with a settlement under which Bechtel dropped its claim. With financing from the Inter-American Development Bank the city expanded its piped water system in the aftermath of the riots. Nevertheless, under public management half of the 600,000 people of Cochabamba remain without piped water and those with it continue to receive intermittent service. Oscar Olivera the leading figure in the protests admitted, &quot;I would have to say we were not ready to build new alternatives.&quot;

===Colombia===
Between 1996 and 2007, public-private partnerships for water and sewer services in more than 40 Colombian cities were entered into, serving more than 20% of the country&#x27;s urban population. Most of the contracts were awarded in municipalities with highly deteriorated infrastructure, such as Barranquilla and Cartagena. The central government financed most investments through grants, thus reducing the need to increase tariffs. Water privatization in Colombia was largely homegrown, adapting models used elsewhere to the particular circumstances and culture of Colombia. A model introduced from Spain, the mixed company with a majority stake by the municipality and a minority stake by a private operator, was particularly successful. Foreign water companies won some of the early contracts, but quickly sold a majority of their shares to Colombian operators. There was a significant increase in access under private contracts. For example, in Cartagena, water supply coverage increased from 74 percent to almost universal coverage, while sewer coverage went up from 62 percent to 79 percent between 1996 and 2006. Half a million people gained access and 60 percent of the new connections benefited families in the poorest income quintile. To achieve universal coverage, the operator made extensive use of community bulk-supply schemes that provide safe water to the many illegal settlements that were expanding on the city&#x27;s periphery. However, there is no conclusive evidence showing that access increased more rapidly under private contracts than in the case of publicly managed utilities. In Cartagena, tariffs declined substantially, indicating that the operator passed on efficiency gains to consumers.

==Impact of privatization==
The evidence concerning the impact of water privatization is mixed. Often proponents and opponents of water privatization emphasize those examples, studies, methods and indicators that support their respective point of view. As with any empirical study, results are influenced by the methods used. For example, some studies simply compare the situation before privatization to the situation after privatization. More sophisticated studies try to compare the changes in privately managed utilities to those of publicly managed utilities that operate under similar conditions during the same period. The second group of studies often use econometric techniques. The results also depend on the choice of the indicator used to measure impact: One common indicator is the increase in access to water supply and sewerage. Other indicators are changes in tariffs, investments, water-borne diseases or indicators for service quality (e.g. continuity of supply or drinking water quality) and efficiency (e.g. water losses or labor productivity).

===Impact on access===
A before after comparative study by World Bank analyzes how access, quality of service, operational efficiency and tariffs have evolved under 65 public-private partnerships for urban water utilities in developing countries. The study estimates that &quot;PPP projects have provided access to piped water for more than 24 million people in developing countries since 1990&quot;. 

Privatized water companies generally increase tariffs to earn more profits, which consequently reduces the accessibility of the resource for poor households since the poor are not able to pay high tariffs. In other words, investments are only made to improve accessibility in richer districts where the people can pay the tariffs. In this manner, the water company&#x27;s need to make adequate returns is met by supplying water only to those who can pay. However, in other countries such as Nigeria and Ghana where the governments fail to distribute access to water to the people, water privatization led to expansion of services to low-income districts.

===Impact on health===
One of the most effective measures of the effectiveness of water privatization is child mortality rate, since children are more likely to be adversely affected by contaminated water. Water privatization has historically had mixed impacts on child mortality and the overall health of the people affected by it. A study found that, between 1991 and 1997 in Argentina, areas where child mortality was upwards of 26% fell to just under 8% after water was privatized, because the regulations imposed on private water companies were more rigorous than their government-controlled counterparts. Along with this, development of water infrastructure in impoverished areas at the hands of private companies also reduced child mortality rates. Some governments privatize water companies, among other reasons, to improve the quality of the water supply.

However in Argentina, water privatization did not fulfill many promises the citizens were expecting. This included the expansion of sewerage treatment and connections and the reduction in the price of water, which actually increased. Along with this, the private water companies in Argentina needed help from the national government to bypass regulatory agencies after it treated to cancel their contract due to conflicts of interest. Many workers&#x27; unions were opposed to privatizing water, but their pleas were largely ignored by the Argentine government.

The impact of water privatization on the amount of carcinogenic substances found in the water supply is highly debated. In some cases, such as the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, public water systems are likely to invest more money into improving water quality. Water companies working on a commercial basis might find it too costly to implement systems to better the water quality beyond what is necessary by law. This might increase the risk of harmful cancer-causing substances in the water.

===Impact on tariffs===
Although the impact on tariffs cannot be fully concluded since each country has different policy on tariffs, water tariffs tend to be increased under privatization. For instance, in Buenos Aires and in Manila, tariffs first declined, but then increased above their initial level; in Cochabamba or in Guyana, tariffs were increased at the time of privatization. However, there are some other cases that tariffs under water privatization did not increase in a long run, typically in Sub-Saharan Africa, where most of investments are funded through development aid. For example, tariffs remained stable in Senegal, while in Gabon they declined by 50% in five years (2001–2006) and by 30% in ten years in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (1990 to 2000).

In addition, initial tariffs have been well below cost recovery levels in almost all cases, sometimes covering only a fraction of the cost of service provision. The magnitude of tariff increases is influenced by the profit margin of private operators, but also to a large extent by the efficiency of utilities in terms of water losses and labor productivity.

However, comparing water expenditure between private and public management in the U.S., a study of household water expenditures in cities under private and public management in the U.S. concludes that &quot;whether water systems are owned by private firms or governments may, on average, simply not matter much.&quot;

===Impact on efficiency===
According to a World Bank study in 2005, the most consistent improvement made by public-private partnerships in water supply was in operational efficiency. The study reviews the impact of private management on the efficiency of water utilities in many countries from many continents including Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Most evidences from the study suggests that &quot;there is no statistically significant difference between the efficiency performance of public and private operators in this sector.&quot;. In addition, a 2008 literature review by the Asian Development Bank shows that of 20 studies reviewed, only three show concrete evidence on technical efficiency improvements or cost reductions under private management. Therefore, by 2005, private operator, at least, made an indirect contribution to financing by improving efficiency, making it possible for utilities to finance investments internally instead of having to rely on more debt.

===Profitability===
An empirical study of 34 concessions in nine Latin American countries during the 1990s, including 10 water concessions in 5 countries (3 in Argentina, 1 in Bolivia, 1 in Brazil, 3 in Chile and 2 in Colombia), has estimated the profitability of concessions compared to the cost of capital of private companies. According to the study, contrary to public perception, the financial returns of private infrastructure concessions have been modest. The average annual return on capital employed was 7 percent. For a number of concessions, the returns have been below the cost of capital. On average telecommunications and energy concessions have fared much better than water concessions. Seven out of 10 water concessions had negative rates of return and two concessions had returns that were lower than the cost of capital of the private companies.

==Private water operators==
Private water operators come in very different forms from multinational corporations to small enterprises. According to the Pinsent Masons Water Yearbook 2010–11, 909 million people (13% of the world population) were served by private operators. The largest private water companies are:

* the French firm Veolia Environnement (Vivendi), serving 125.4 million in 2011;
* the French firm Suez, serving 124.3 million people in 2011 with its US subsidiary United Water and its Spanish subsidiary Aguas de Barcelona;
* the Spanish firm Fomento de Construcciones Y Contratas SA (FCC), serving 28.2 million people in 2011;
* the German firm RWE, serving 18.3 million people in 2011;
* the Italian firm ACEA, serving 18 million people in 2011;
* the British firm Thames Water, indirectly owned by Macquarie Group, an Australian investment bank;
* the French firm SAUR, serving 12.4 million in 2011; and
* the US firm American Water, serving 16.8 million in 2011.

Domestic water operators have a strong presence in Brazil, Colombia, China, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

Public water companies also sometimes participate in bids for private water contracts. For example, the Moroccan state-owned water utility ONEP has won a bid in Cameroon and the Dutch publicly owned water firm Vitens has won a management contract in Ghana.

<text>Jonathan Clay &quot;JJ&quot; Redick ( ) (born June 24, 1984) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He most recently served as an analyst for ESPN. Redick played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils, winning many individual awards, including the Naismith College Player of the Year. Selected 11th overall by the Orlando Magic in the 2006 NBA draft, he played for 15 seasons in the NBA with six different teams. In 2024, Redick was appointed head coach of the Lakers.

In college and his professional career, Redick was known for his excellent three-point and free-throw shooting. He set Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) career records for most points and most ACC tournament points. Redick set several records at Duke, including all-time leading scorer and most points in a season. He holds a few NCAA free-throw-percentage records and several ACC records.

After being drafted by the Magic, he played for seven seasons in Orlando, followed by a short spell with the Milwaukee Bucks, then four seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. He signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2017, and another the following year. In 2019, Redick signed a two-year deal with the New Orleans Pelicans. He was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in 2021. After 15 seasons in the NBA, Redick retired on September 21, 2021. Redick holds single-season three-point field goal records for several of the teams he played for.

In 2016, Redick became the first NBA player and the second active professional athlete to start a weekly podcast during the regular season. He later co-founded the media company ThreeFourTwo Productions.

==High school career==
Redick was a McDonald&#x27;s All-American at Cave Spring High School in Roanoke, Virginia, winning the 2002 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game MVP. He scored 43 points as a senior in the Virginia High School League (VHSL) Class AAA state championship game, a game in which the Knights defeated George Wythe High School of Richmond. Redick&#x27;s total was a VHSL championship-game record for all classes, standing until Mac McClung scored 47 for Gate City High School in the 2018 Class 2A final. Redick played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball with the Boo Williams team, playing against Dwyane Wade in a July 1999 tournament in Orlando.

Considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Redick was highly recruited and listed as the No. 2 shooting guard and the No. 13 player in the nation in 2002.

==College career==
In his first year at Duke University, Redick led his team with 30 points in their victory over NC State in the ACC Tournament championship game. He put up 26 points against Central Michigan in the second round of the NCAA tournament. However, he struggled in Duke&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen loss to Kansas, hitting only two of 16 shots.

Redick served as co-captain in his junior year, along with senior point guard Daniel Ewing. He also served as captain his senior year, along with fellow seniors Shelden Williams, Sean Dockery and Lee Melchionni.

In the 2004–05 season, Redick led Duke in scoring with 21.8 points per game. He won the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Adolph F. Rupp Trophy for national player of the year. Redick&#x27;s victory in the Rupp voting spoiled the consensus for Utah&#x27;s Andrew Bogut, who won every other major player of the year award. In 2006, after facing close competition all year from Gonzaga&#x27;s Adam Morrison, Redick won the major player of the year awards.

Redick set an ACC record for consecutive free throws with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003, and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012, by Scott Wood from NC State. Redick entered his final postseason with a chance to go down as the NCAA&#x27;s all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3% (minimum 300 made and 2.5/game), was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC tournament and early NCAA tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724).

On February 14, 2006, in the first half of a game against Wake Forest, Redick broke Virginia alumnus Curtis Staples&#x27;s NCAA record of 413 career three-pointers made. Keydren Clark of Saint Peter&#x27;s College subsequently surpassed Redick&#x27;s mark in the MAAC tournament. However, Redick returned the favor by hitting 15 three-pointers in the ACC Tournament and 12 in the NCAA Tournament to finish ahead of Clark. Redick finished his career with an NCAA-record 457 three-point field goals shooting 40.4% from three-point range. His career three-pointers record was broken on February 2, 2014, by Oakland University&#x27;s Travis Bader.

In the game after breaking Staples&#x27; record, Redick scored 30 points on February 19, 2006, against Miami to become the all-time leading scorer at Duke, with 2,557 points scored in his career. On February 25, in a game versus Temple, Redick passed Dickie Hemric&#x27;s 51-year-old ACC scoring record of 2,587 points with a pair of free throws in the waning minutes of the game. His record was topped in one of the opening round games of the 2009 NCAA tournament by North Carolina&#x27;s Tyler Hansbrough. Redick finished his career with 2,769 points.

On March 10, 2006, in an ACC Tournament quarterfinal against Miami, Redick scored 25 points, setting a Duke record for points in a season with 858. Redick ended the season with 964 points. Redick came up just short of the ACC record for points scored in a season, which was set by Dennis Scott with 970 points in 1990. Redick also finished his career as the leading scorer in ACC tournament history. His total of 225 points eclipsed Wake Forest&#x27;s Len Chappell, who scored 220 points in the tournament from 1960 to 1962.
As the marquee player of the Blue Devils, Redick was the target of abuse by fans of rival teams. In 2006, Clay Travis of CBS Sports called him the &quot;most hated current athlete in America.&quot; After students from rivals Maryland and North Carolina discovered his cell phone number, Redick estimated that he received 50 to 75 hate calls per day. Opposing crowds would shout obscenity-laced tirades, yelling at him that &quot;they had sex with his little sister&quot; and &quot;your little brother is gay&quot;. The abuse nearly led him to quit basketball in his sophomore year. He turned to writing poetry as an outlet.

He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season, tied as of March 28, 2010, for 5th-most in Duke history with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and Jason Williams.

Redick was the cover athlete and official spokesman for College Hoops 2K7, released on Xbox, Xbox 360
&amp; PlayStation 2 in 2006 and PlayStation 3 in 2007.

On February 4, 2007, Duke retired Redick&#x27;s no. 4 jersey at Cameron Indoor Stadium in a halftime ceremony, the 13th player so honored.

 of the NCAA Record book, Redick held two NCAA records (career FT%, min 600 attempts – 91.2%; Sophomore season FT%, 95.3%) and was listed in nine other categories among their all-time leaders.

==Professional career==

===Orlando Magic (2006–2013)===
Redick was selected with the 11th pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. Pre-draft scouting reports praised Redick&#x27;s perimeter shooting and basketball intelligence, but questioned his defensive ability and speculated that he might not be tall or athletic enough to create his own shots in the NBA. This scouting report was highlighted when Duke played LSU in the 2006 NCAA tournament. LSU&#x27;s Garrett Temple, a 6&#x27;5&quot; guard known for his athleticism and a large wingspan, chased Redick throughout the game. Taken out of his normal rhythm, Redick—the number two scorer in the nation at the time—had one of the worst shooting performances of his college career, shooting 3-for-18 from the field and scoring 11 points in a Duke loss.

In a 2005 interview with the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot;, Redick said, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don&#x27;t expect to be a star, I&#x27;ll just shoot, be a team player.&quot; He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill.
Redick competed against Trevor Ariza and Keith Bogans for the starting shooting guard spot in 2007–08. He was pulled from playing more than once for his lack of defense during the preseason. He came into the season as a third-string player and saw limited action due to back spasms, but moved into limited rotation after Ariza was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers early in the season. In January 2008, Redick posted on his personal blog that &quot;it&#x27;s been proven that even if I play well in the limited minutes I get that not much is going to change.&quot; On January 31, 2008, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; reported that Redick had asked his agent, Arn Tellem, to inquire about a possible trade. &quot;We want to see what&#x27;s out there,&quot; Redick said. &quot;I want to stay here, but it&#x27;s been frustrating.&quot; Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: &quot;Right now it would be very hard to fit him in. I know it&#x27;s also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we&#x27;re going good so we probably won&#x27;t disrupt things.&quot; The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy&#x27;s comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the February 21, 2008 trade deadline.

In the 2008–09 season, Redick averaged 17.4 minutes per game instead of the previous season&#x27;s 8.1; he played in 64 games instead of the previous season&#x27;s 34. He averaged six points per game. The Magic made it to the NBA Finals, but lost to the Lakers in five games. Redick started all seven games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in place of regular starter Courtney Lee.

On March 28, 2010, Redick set career highs in rebounds (7), assists (8) and minutes played (46). Vince Carter was injured just 95 seconds into the game; backup swingman Mickael Pietrus was also injured, leaving Redick to play the entire game.

On July 9, 2010, the Chicago Bulls signed Redick to a three-year, $19 million offer sheet. The Magic matched this offer on July 16, 2010, retaining the rights to Redick. On April 25, 2012, Redick achieved a career high with the Magic, scoring 31 points against the Charlotte Bobcats.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2013)===

On February 21, 2013, Redick was traded from the Magic to the Milwaukee Bucks along with guard Ish Smith and forward Gustavo Ayón for guard Beno Udrih, guard Doron Lamb, and forward Tobias Harris. Redick had difficulties in Milwaukee and his performance suffered.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2013–2017)===
On July 10, 2013, Redick was acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers via a three-team sign-and-trade deal that also involved the Bucks and the Phoenix Suns. Redick reportedly signed a four-year, $27 million contract. Redick started 218 of the first 219 games he played for the Clippers, becoming a &quot;full-fledged starter&quot; in the NBA. On January 15, 2014, Redick scored a then career-high 33 points in a 129–127 win over the Dallas Mavericks.

On January 18, 2016, Redick scored a career-high 40 points in a 140–132 overtime win over the Houston Rockets. He connected on his first five attempts behind the arc and finished 9-of-12 on three-pointers, tying Caron Butler&#x27;s franchise record for three-pointers made in a game. He later competed in the Three-Point Contest during the 2016 NBA All-Star weekend.

On November 5, 2016, Redick increased his streak of consecutive games with a made three-pointer to 62, in a 116–92 win over the San Antonio Spurs. He also completed a four-point play against the Spurs, the 26th of his career. On April 12, 2017, Redick made three 3-pointers against Sacramento in the regular-season finale to finish with 201, breaking his career high and single-season franchise record of 200. The Clippers went on to lose in the first round of the NBA playoffs in seven games to the Utah Jazz.

===Philadelphia 76ers (2017–2019)===
On July 8, 2017, Redick signed a one-year, $23 million contract with the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 3, 2017, Redick scored 31 points on 11-of-19 shooting with 8-of-12 from 3-point range in a 121–110 win over the Indiana Pacers. On November 25, 2017, he hit eight 3-pointers and scored 29 points in a 130–111 win over the Orlando Magic. Redick missed seven games in January 2018 with a leg injury.

On July 6, 2018, Redick re-signed with the 76ers. Redick was moved to the bench for the start of the 2018–19 season and on October 20, he had his best game since moving to the bench, scoring 31 points on 10-of-20 shooting, including eight 3-pointers, in a 116–115 win over the Magic. On December 19, in a 131–109 win over the New York Knicks, Redick scored his 10,000th career point. On February 8, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 117–110 win over the Denver Nuggets. On March 19, he was two assists shy of his first NBA triple-double in 761 career games, finishing with 27 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in a 118–114 win over the Charlotte Hornets. In April 2019, Redick set the franchise record for most 3-pointers in a season, surpassing Kyle Korver&#x27;s mark of 226 set in 2004–05.

===New Orleans Pelicans (2019–2021)===
On July 15, 2019, Redick signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. After finishing the pandemic-shortened season with a record of 30–42, the Pelicans missed the playoffs, marking the first time in Redick&#x27;s career that he missed the playoffs. He was reunited with his former Magic head coach Stan Van Gundy in his second season in New Orleans.

===Dallas Mavericks (2021)===
Redick was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on March 26, 2021. He made his debut with the Mavs on April 12.

On September 21, 2021, Redick announced his retirement from playing basketball.

== Coaching career ==
===Los Angeles Lakers (2024–present)===
Redick was announced as the 29th head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers on June 24, 2024. With this, Redick became a rookie head coach with no prior coaching experience other than serving as a volunteer head coach of the fourth-grade boys team at Brooklyn Basketball Academy, where his 9-year-old son played. In his coaching debut on October 22, 2024, the Lakers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 110–103 for a season-opening win.

==National team career==
Redick was a member of the 2003 USA Junior World Championship Team. In 2005, he competed with the USA Basketball Under-21 Team, which won a gold medal at the Global Games. In 2006, Redick was named to the 2006–2008 USA national team program. He competed for a spot with the team for the 2008 Olympics, but was not placed on the final roster. A recurring back injury kept him from competing in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship.

== Media career ==

=== Podcasting ===
In January 2016, Redick launched a podcast on Yahoo! Sports. He was the first active NBA player and the second active professional athlete to host a podcast. Redick said that he did not get any pushback from the organizations about doing the podcast and attributed that to focusing on getting the basketball work done first.

He began in 2016 at Yahoo! Sports, hosting &quot;The Vertical&quot;. In July 2017, he moved his podcast to Uninterrupted, under the title &quot;The Chronicles of Redick&quot;. After meeting producer and writer Tommy Alter, Redick decided to continue his podcast on The Ringer in 2017. Redick hosted three seasons on the Ringer: two as a solo host, and the third with Alter as co-host.

In 2020, he left The Ringer to own his content and start his own media company, co-founding ThreeFourTwo Productions with Alter, a reference to the 342 shots he would take every Sunday during the off-season. He hosted &quot;The Old Man and the Three&quot; along with Alter before announcing his departure to coach the Lakers. The podcast premiered August 5, 2020, inside the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida with Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard as the first guest. Redick&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Three&quot; has over 320 million views on YouTube and 4.8 stars on Apple Podcasts.

In March 2024, Redick and LeBron James launched a podcast called &quot;Mind the Game&quot;, co-produced by Redick and James&#x27; production companies, ThreeFourTwo Productions and Uninterrupted, where the two have &quot;pure conversations about basketball&quot;. In June 2024, Redick announced that he would be going on an indefinite hiatus from podcasting to take the job of head coach for the Los Angeles Lakers.

Redick occasionally appeared on &quot;First Take&quot;.

=== Broadcasting ===
After he retired as a player, Redick became an on-air sports analyst for ESPN. He debuted on November 3, 2021, as a studio analyst for coverage of the Brooklyn Nets-Atlanta Hawks game.

In August 2023, Redick was added to the second core broadcast team of ESPN with Ryan Ruocco and Richard Jefferson. In February 2024, he was moved to the lead team of Mike Breen and Doris Burke, replacing Doc Rivers, who became head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. In June 2024, Redick left ESPN to become head coach of the Lakers.

==Personal life==
Redick was born in Cookeville, Tennessee, the son of Jeanie and Ken Redick. His father played basketball for two seasons at Ohio Wesleyan University, and his older twin sisters, Catie and Alyssa, both played for Campbell University. His younger brother, David, was a tight end for the Marshall University&#x27;s football team until he decided not to play due to injury. He then moved to Orlando with JJ before going back home and attending Virginia Tech. His youngest sister, Abigail, played basketball for Virginia Tech and Drexel University. Redick was nicknamed &quot;JJ&quot; as a toddler because his twin sisters repeated his original nickname of &quot;J&quot;. His father&#x27;s background as a stoneware potter led to his middle name, &quot;Clay.&quot; Redick graduated from Duke University with a major in history and a minor in cultural anthropology.

Redick is a Christian. Redick has four tattoos of Bible verses: Isaiah 40:31, Joshua 1:9, Psalm 40:1–3, and Philippians 4:13, as well as a tattoo sleeve of the Virgin Mary.

On June 13, 2006, Redick was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in Durham County, North Carolina. His blood-alcohol level was 0.11, while the legal limit in North Carolina is 0.08. Redick was released on a $1,000 bond shortly after being arrested. Redick pleaded guilty.

On June 26, 2010, Redick married longtime girlfriend Chelsea Kilgore. They have two children together, Knox and Kai.

On January 9, 2025, Redick&#x27;s rental home in Pacific Palisades was destroyed by the Palisades Fire.

<text>Farres () is a former municipality in Achaea, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it is part of the municipality Erymanthos, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 241.848 km2. The municipality of Farres existed between 1835 and 1912, and again between 1998 and 2011. Its seat of administration was in the town Chalandritsa. Farres is situated in the centre of Achaea, on the upper courses of the rivers Peiros and Parapeiros. Towards the southeast (Mount Erymanthos) and northeast (Panachaiko) the terrain is increasingly mountainous. It is located about 15 km south of Patras and 30 km west of Kalavryta. The Greek National Road 33 (Patras - Tripoli) runs through western Farres.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Farres is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Chalandritsa (Chalandritsa, Kydonies, Mastoraiika-Stamaiika)
*Chrysopigi (Chrysopigi, Ano Chrysopigi)
*Elliniko (Elliniko, Agia Eleousa, Koumani, Neochori, Chrysavgi)
*Fares (Fares, Prevedos)
*Isoma
*Kalanistra (Kalanistra, Rodia)
*Kalanos 
*Kalousi
*Katarraktis
*Kritharakia (Kritharakia, Asteri, Toskes)
*Lakkomata (Lakkomata, Tsapournia)
*Mirali
*Neo Kompigadi (Neo Kompigadi, Micha, Platanos)
*Platanovrysi (Platanovrysi, Agia Paraskevi, Kato Platanovrysi, Koimisis)
*Starochori (Ano Starochori, Dafnoula, Kato Starochori, Trousas)
*Vasiliko (Vasiliko, Agrilia, Kydonies, Sterna, Stefani)

==Historical population==
==History==

Near Chalandritsa, a Mycenaean settlement was excavated in 1985. Pharae was one of the cities of the Achaean League. After the Roman conquest, it belonged to Patras. During the Frankish rule (13th-14th century) the Barony of Chalandritsa was established. The barony was ruled by the French Dramelay (or Trémolay) family and later the Genoese Zaccaria family. The remains of the Frankish castle have been preserved. Ottoman rule lasted until the Greek War of Independence, in which the area was liberated in 1821–1822. Two earthquakes, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, struck the municipality on February 5, 2008, causing little damage.

<doc id="1303236" wikidata="Q4812197" url="?curid=1303236" title="Asynchronous system trap">
<text>Asynchronous system trap (AST) refers to a mechanism used in several computer operating systems designed by the former Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts. The mechanism is a method for executing subroutines outside of the main thread of execution.

==Mechanism==

Various events within these systems can be optionally signalled back to the user processes via the AST mechanism. These ASTs act like subroutine calls but they are delivered asynchronously, that is, without any regard to the context of the main thread. Because of this, care must be taken:
* to ensure that any code that is shared between the main thread and the AST must be designed to be reentrant, and
* any data that is shared must be safe against corruption if modified at any time by the AST. Otherwise, the data must be guarded by blocking ASTs during critical sections.

ASTs are most commonly encountered as a result of issuing QIO calls to the kernel. Completion of the I/O can be signalled by the issuance of an AST to the calling process/task. Certain runtime errors could also be signalled using the AST mechanism. Within OpenVMS, Special Kernel-Mode ASTs are used as the standard mechanism for getting relatively convenient access to a process context (including getting the process paged into physical memory as may be needed). These types of ASTs are executed at the highest possible per-process priority the next time the scheduler makes that process current, and are used among other things for retrieving process-level information (in response to a $GETJPI &quot;getjob/process information&quot; system call) and for performing process deletion.

The following operating systems implement ASTs:
* RSX-11 (including all of the variants)
* RSTS/E
* OpenVMS

ASTs are roughly analogous to Unix signals. The important differences are:
* There are no &quot;signal codes&quot; assigned to ASTs: instead of assigning a handler to a signal code and raising that code, the AST is specified directly by its address. This allows any number of ASTs to be pending at once (subject to process quotas).
* ASTs never abort any system call in progress. In fact, it is possible for a process to put itself into a &quot;hibernate&quot; state (with the $HIBER system call), or to wait for an event flag by calling e.g. $WAITFR, whereupon it does nothing but wait for ASTs to be delivered. When an AST is delivered (triggered by an IO completion, timer, or other event), the process is temporarily taken out of the wait to execute the AST. After the AST procedure completes, the call that put the process into hibernation or the event flag wait is made again; in essence, the reason for the wait is re-evaluated. The only way to get out of this loop (apart from process deletion) is to execute a $WAKE or $SETEF system call to satisfy the wait. This can be done by the process itself by invoking $WAKE or $SETEF within the AST, or (if a global event flag is used) $SETEF within another process. 

VAX/VMS V4 and later implemented an interesting optimization to the problem of synchronizing between AST-level and non-AST-level code. A system service named $SETAST could be used to disable or enable the delivery of ASTs for the current and all less-privileged &quot;access modes&quot; (the OpenVMS term for ring-based security features). However, if the critical section needing protection from ASTs was only a few instructions long, then the overhead of making the $SETAST calls could far outweigh the time to execute those instructions.

So for user mode only (the least privileged ring, normally used by ordinary user programs), a pair of bit flags was provided at a predefined user-writable memory location (in per-process &quot;P1&quot; space). The meanings of these two flags could be construed as &quot;don&#x27;t deliver any ASTs&quot; and &quot;ASTs have been disabled&quot;. Instead of the usual pair of $SETAST calls, the user-mode code would set the first flag before executing the sequence of instructions during which ASTs need to be blocked, and clear it after the sequence. &quot;Then&quot; (note the ordering here, to avoid race conditions) it would check the second flag to see if it had become set during this time: if so, then ASTs really have become disabled, and $SETAST should be called to re-enable them. In the most common case, no ASTs would have become pending during this time, so there would be no need to call $SETAST at all.

The kernel AST delivery code, for its part, would check the first flag before trying to deliver a user-mode AST; if it was set, then it would directly set the ASTs-disabled bit in the process control block (the same bit that would be set by an explicit $SETAST call from user mode), and also set the second flag, before returning and leaving the AST undelivered.

The asynchronous procedure call mechanism in the Windows NT family of operating systems is a similar mechanism.

<doc id="1303239" wikidata="Q7979189" url="?curid=1303239" title="Wedgwood, Seattle">
<text>Wedgwood is a middle-class residential neighborhood of northeast Seattle, Washington with a modest commercial strip. Wedgwood is located about north, and slightly east, of the University of Washington; it is about northeast of Downtown. The neighborhood is further typical of Seattle neighborhoods in having more than one name and having different, overlapping, but well-documented definitions of the neighborhood.

The misspelling Wedgewood is not uncommon—it is used by at least five businesses and even appears in the unofficial &quot;City Clerk&#x27;s Neighborhood Map Atlas&quot;—but the origin and spelling of the name are clear: the neighborhood was named after the English bone china-maker Wedgwood, the favorite of the wife of Albert (&quot;Al&quot;) Balch (1903–1976), the developer who named the neighborhood. Balch was also the founder of adjoining View Ridge.

== History ==

The area has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). The &quot;Dkhw&#x27;Duw&#x27;Absh&quot;, &quot;the People of the Inside&quot;, and the &quot;xachua&#x27;bsh&quot; or &quot;hah-choo-AHBSH&quot;, &quot;People of a Large Lake&quot; or &quot;Lake People&quot;, today the Duwamish tribe, Native Americans of the Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish hunted and traveled through what is now Wedgwood. The Wedgwood Rock, a glacial erratic boulder tall by circumference became the intersection of a number of trails through dense, old growth forest that covered what is now Seattle. The neighborhood has adopted Big Rock after it was protected from housing development in 1941.

The land that formed the original core of Wedgwood, west of 35th Avenue NE between 80th and 85th Streets, was at one time a heavily wooded ginseng farm. Charles E. Thorpe had cleared a portion of his tract north of the Seattle city limits of the time, building a log cabin from the wood of his own trees. By the 1920s, 35th Avenue NE was becoming a thoroughfare with homes and businesses (the first store opened in 1922), the electric (1923), water (1926), and sewer grids had been extended to the area, and it was becoming too urban for Thorpe&#x27;s tastes. The Jesuit institution Seattle University paid Thorpe $65,000 for the property, planning to build a new campus there and move north from First Hill. Thorpe left Seattle, never to return.
One month later came the Stock Market Crash of 1929. The Great Depression put the Jesuits&#x27; plans for the new campus on hold. Thorpe&#x27;s cabin became St. Ignatius Parish in 1929; the congregation grew through the Depression years, although it was served at that time only by visiting priests. By 1940, the Jesuits had decided not to relocate Seattle University, and sold Thorpe&#x27;s to Albert Balch at a loss, for only $22,500, barely a third of what they had paid for the land in 1929.

A Catholic presence remains in the neighborhood: the parish of St. Ignatius became the parish of Our Lady of the Lake at its present location on 35th Avenue at 89th Street NE (c. 1961).
When Balch obtained the land from the Jesuits, it was still &quot;completely undeveloped, heavily treed, and with only one structure,&quot; Thorpe&#x27;s cabin.
Major development of the neighborhood began during World War II with defense worker housing; initial development was largely by Balch and his partner Maury Setzer. Balch and Setzer built 500 homes on 40 acres (160,000 m², 16 hectares), constituting the center of today&#x27;s Wedgwood neighborhood. At the time, the area was north of Seattle city limits (Seattle ended at NE 65th Street). In its first act of community organizing, Wedgwood formed its own Volunteer Fire Department (Fire District #19), founded November 11, 1943, absorbed (with Wedgwood) into the city March 20, 1945. During its short life, the volunteer department operated a Ford Model A truck with a pump, based in the garage of a neighborhood home. In this wartime period, many of the volunteer firefighters were women.

Al Balch was a direct descendant of 17th century New England settler John Balch. Possibly in tribute to this heritage, he had the firm of Thomas, Grainger &amp; Thomas design the houses in the Cape Cod style. Each house was unique in some way, and each originally sold for $5,000 ($65,900 in 2005 dollars); currently (as of 2005, 2006) all go for upwards of $300,000 ($22,800 in 1941 dollars); many (albeit with updating and often with further improvements and extensions) go for as much as $450,000.

Other portions of Wedgwood have distinct histories of their own. In 1936, Dr. and Mrs. Philip M. Rogers purchased between 40th and 45th Avenues NE, from NE 88th Street to NE 92nd Street. Maple Creek flows through this property, forming a ravine. Until shortly after 1950, they left the land almost entirely undeveloped, allowing it to be used as a Boy Scout camp. According to Valarie Bunn, at the time &quot;no traffic noise could be heard and no electric lights&quot; could be seen in the area of the camp. The land was developed in the 1950s. The Earl J. McLaughlin Plat (between NE 85th and NE 90th Streets, and 30th and 35th Avenue NE) was filed in 1907, but at the time there was no city water or electricity in the area. Few lots were sold at that time, and those were sold cheaply. In 1917, Earl J. McLaughlin relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained active in real estate for 12 years, before emigrating to Canada.

The large P-Patch Community Garden near the west edge of the neighborhood, and the adjoining University Prep School and Temple Beth Am (Reform synagogue) are on land that remained a working farm as late as 1965. Wedgwood has Seattle&#x27;s oldest and largest P-Patch (mid-1960s); as of 2005, there are now 52 others. The &quot;P&quot; originally stood for &quot;Picardo&quot;, the family who farmed the land (1922–1965).

Just south of the old Picardo Farm is Dahl Playfield. Like the P-Patch, it is former peat bog land, once known as the Ravenna Swamp. In the 1940s houses stood on part of what is now the playfield; at that time, Picardo Farm was the site contemplated for a park. However, after sewer lines were built along 25th Avenue NE in the late 1940s, houses began sinking in the peat; the city bought them out and turned the land into the &quot;80th Street Playfield&quot;. In 1952, the bog caught fire: portions subsided as much as , and the park was temporarily closed. Over the next few years, an estimated 75,000 cubic yards (57,000 cubic meters) of peat was replaced by fill dirt, and the park reopened. In 1955, the park was renamed after a former Park Board director, Waldo J. Dahl. In September 1992, the Wedgwood Community Council officially &quot;adopted&quot; the park.

The Wedgewood Estates apartment complex on NE 75th Street between 37th and 39th avenues NE was purchased by the Seattle Housing Authority in 2001 in an effort to preserve a supply of moderately priced housing in this part of Seattle.

== The Jolly Roger and the Coon Chicken Inn ==
In 1916, Washington joined Prohibition, and north Seattle saw an upswing in commercial activity. Unincorporated areas of King County accessible by auto became popular locations for speakeasies selling illegal liquor and purveying prostitution and gambling, often in clever guises. One remarkable structure among numerous establishments was the China Castle, later the Jolly Roger, having a unique tower from which a watchman signaled the approach of police, visible from miles away. In the event of a raid, patrons and employees could leave via tunnels such as one under the highway, easily dispersing via the wooded ravine on the other side.

The Jolly Roger continued as a popular dance hall and restaurant. It was designated a Seattle Historic Landmark in 1979. On October 19, 1989, the restaurant, located at 8721 Lake City Way (formerly Bothell Way) burned in an arson fire. The fire was somewhat suspicious, but only relative to its storied past. Police had neither motive nor suspects. Investigators were not able to determine how the arsonist got inside past a burglar alarm, with no signs of forced entry. At the time, the building had just been purchased the week before from the previous owner, with whom the buyer was entangled in legal and financial red tape. The previous owner was in the building removing his possessions the day before the fire. When firefighters arrived hours after the fire had begun in the basement, a man directed them. He seemed so sure of where the fire began that they assumed he was an employee. After the fire was extinguished, the man could not be found. The owners stated that he was not an employee.

One year after the fire, preservation activists sought to have the structure rebuilt. Before their efforts got off the ground, the building was hastily demolished on January 11, 1991, obviating its appeal. A modern oil company-owned convenience store and gas station now stands on the location.

Within view, slightly south of the former Jolly Roger site, on the south side of Lake City Way, The Growler Guys sits on the site of a former Coon Chicken Inn. For nearly three decades, beginning in 1929, the Coon Chicken Inn sold southern-style food in a restaurant whose themes drew heavily on light-hearted, overtly racist stereotypes akin to blackface or the iconic Sambo&#x27;s on Aurora Avenue N.

== Business ==

Mr. and Mrs. Nick Jacklin opened the first store in what is now Wedgwood in 1922, before either electricity or city water reached the neighborhood. The building still survives as the garage of a house in the 7500 block of 35th Avenue NE. That same block was later (1949–1974) home of McGillivray&#x27;s Variety and Gift Store, whose range of wares ranged from penny candy, children&#x27;s clothing and hundreds of different children&#x27;s birthday cards to &quot;fine collector dolls… in a better selection than… even… the downtown Frederick &amp; Nelson&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;sequins in every color manufactured&quot;.

Half a mile (0.7 km) north, McVicar&#x27;s Hardware Store (1946–1986)—in the space in the 8500 block of 35th Avenue NE opened shortly after World War II. The shortage of consumer goods right after the war meant that some of their early stock was manufactured on-site from war surplus. Adapting their business to whatever people in the neighborhood wanted to buy, as Wedgwood residents began putting in lawns and gardens, McVicar&#x27;s sold them the requisite supplies; they sold specialty foods and rented out skis; they were also, for a decade, the only hardware store in the state licensed to sell beer and wine. They ran do-it-yourself clinics on everything from tools to gourmet cooking; in 1954, they were mentioned in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article on the do-it-yourself trend.
Today, there is a shopping district along 35th Avenue NE, with concentrations of stores at NE 75th Street and NE 85th Street. A small QFC store at the Wedgwood Center near 85th Street closed in 2021 and is planned to be redeveloped into a mixed-use retail and residential building. The center also has the Wedgwood Broiler, a 1950s American style neighborhood restaurant and bar.

The neighborhood&#x27;s post office is located midway between the main commercial centers on 35th Avenue. On NE 68th Street, just south of what the city unofficially defines to be Wedgwood proper, is the Seattle Public Library Northeast Branch, the largest neighborhood branch and the second-busiest public library, second only to the Seattle Central Library. The offices and retail store of Birds Connect Seattle (formerly the Seattle Audubon Society) is located in Wedgwood.

== Community ==

===Community organizations===
In 1946, Wedgwood residents formed Wedgwood Community Club, which lasted for several decades, but eventually petered out. In the 1980s this vacuum was filled by the current Wedgwood Community Council.

The Musicians Emeritus Symphony Orchestra (MESO), Wedgwood&#x27;s non-profit community orchestra, was founded in 1971 by Seattle mayor Wes Uhlman. MESO was originally intended specifically for older musicians, and as of 2008, the oldest is 91 years old, but now the orchestra includes players of all ages. In 2009 MESO changed its name to Seattle Festival Orchestra (SFO). Currently SFO rehearses and performs in the Wedgwood neighborhood. Four times a concert season, SFO performs at the University Prep Academy.

===Education===
Wedgwood neighborhood schools (as defined by the unofficial city map) include:
* Wedgwood Elementary School (Kindergarten–5th grade) – Seattle Public Schools 
* Our Lady of the Lake Parish School (preschool–8th grade) – Roman Catholic 
* Concordia Lutheran School (preschool–8th grade) – Lutheran, is several blocks further south and is east of NE 35th Street, and might be considered to fall well within View Ridge
* Nathan Eckstein Middle School (6th–8th grade) – Seattle Public Schools, is immediately south of NE 75th Street (considered by some to place it just outside Wedgwood)
* University Prep (6th–12th grade)
* Nathan Hale High School (9th-12th grade) in Meadowbrook and Roosevelt High School (9th-12th grade)in Ravenna are rival high schools that split students from Wedgwood.

==Religion==
Wedgwood and the adjoining View Ridge and Bryant neighborhoods constitute one of the three centers of Seattle&#x27;s Jewish community, along with Seward Park and the suburb of Mercer Island. Nonetheless, Jews constitute less than 10% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population. Located in Wedgwood are:
* Community Center: Stroum Jewish Community Center, now located near Dahl Field
* Reform synagogue: Temple Beth Am
* Conservative synagogue: Congregation Beth Shalom
* Two Orthodox synagogues are within walking distance of Wedgwood, though outside of the city&#x27;s unofficial boundary for the neighborhood: Emmanuel Congregation and Congregation Shaarei Tefilah, the latter which is associated with Chabad Lubavitch)

Christian churches based in Wedgwood include: 
* Messiah Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod), with a preschool through 8th grade school (Concordia), on 35th Avenue at 70th Street
* Wedgwood Presbyterian Church on 35th Avenue at NE 80th Street (which also hosts an Indonesian Presbyterian congregation)
* Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church, with a parish preschool through 8th grade school, on 35th Avenue at NE 89th
* Wedgwood Community Church on 30th Avenue at 82nd Street
* University Unitarian Church, a Modernist structure designed by Paul Hayden Kirk, on 35th Avenue at NE 68th Street

Wedgwood also hosted a congregation of Mars Hill Church, a multi-campus church with several locations across western Washington. The church meets in a renovated Baptist church originally built in 1952 on NE 95th Street near 35th. Official services began in 2007. After the dissolution of Mars Hill in 2014, this became OneLife Community Church.

== Geography ==

Like all Seattle neighborhoods, Wedgwood has no official or universally agreed-upon borders. The unofficial &quot;City Clerk&#x27;s Neighborhood Map Atlas&quot; shows its boundaries as
* bounded on the north by NE 95th Street
* bounded on the east by 45th Avenue NE
* bounded on the south by NE 75th Street
* bounded on the west by a route coming north from NE 75th Street along 25th Avenue NE, then jogging due west along NE 85th Street and snaking up Lake City Way NE to NE 95th Street

This is quite similar to how the Wedgwood Community Council (WCC) defined the neighborhood limits in 1956, the only difference being the western limit. The WCC considered 25th Avenue NE to be the limit all the way north; this excludes the area west of 25th Avenue NE, extending west to Lake City Way NE between NE 85th Street and NE 95th Street.

However, NE 75th Street presents no discernible break in the business strip along 35th Avenue NE, which continues south to NE 65th Street; many of the businesses and churches in these ten blocks identify themselves as being in Wedgwood; some even have &quot;Wedgwood&quot; in their names. If the City Clerk&#x27;s unofficial borders are accepted, then the landmark Wedgwood Rock, a large -tall boulder at the corner of 28th Avenue NE and NE 72nd Street, lies in the adjoining Ravenna neighborhood.

Several other well-documented interpretations exist. Among them, &quot;Seattle Neighborhoods&quot; of HistoryLink.org&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Washington State History&quot; does not define boundaries for Wedgwood, other than as adjacent to surrounding neighborhoods. Their map suggests Wedgwood is between 25th and 45th Avenues, and NE 75th Street may divide from View Ridge neighborhood.

The &quot;Neighbors&quot; project (1996–2000) of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, currently updated as the &quot;Webtowns&quot; section of the on-line &quot;P-I&quot;, defines Wedgwood a little differently. While they say the boundaries are NE 95th Street to the north, NE 75th Street to the south, 25th Ave NE to the west and approximately 45th Avenue NE to the east, &quot;Neighbors&quot; defines Wedgwood primarily in terms of a series of businesses and other public spaces on 35th Avenue NE, extending as far south as NE 68th Street: from south to north, the Northeast Library (NE 68th), Rod and Judy Neldam&#x27;s Grateful Bread bakery (NE 70th), the post office at NE 77th, the Wedgwood Broiler (NE 83rd), Matthew&#x27;s Red Apple Market (NE 85th, since overtaken by supermarket chain QFC), and finally the Fiddler&#x27;s Inn Pub (NE 94th), built in 1934, a former dive that was fixed up in the early 1990s. They describe Wedgwood as having more in common with Ballard than with Capitol Hill (which is to say, not particularly hip or trendy), and say that downtown Wedgwood along 35th Avenue NE has a look and feel of a small town main street, for better and worse, as it struggles like Main Streets across the country in the age of malls and Internet shopping.

&quot;Neighbors&quot; further asserts that Wedgwood has always been a middle-class neighborhood, trending toward upper middle, with home sales suggesting that it is currently becoming more of a young family area, as the initial 1940s owners reach the end of their lives and Baby Boomers become retirees. Emblematic of this change, the former McVicar&#x27;s space, after serving as a full-service bicycle shop 1986–2001, is now All That Dance, once Seattle&#x27;s largest dance studio with an enrollment of more than 1,500—mostly children, (prior to relocating out of the immediate area) a testament to the changes in the area. Wedgwood has long had an active neighborhood council, one of the most active in Seattle, effectively lobbying in and for the neighborhood, as well as working with the unusually numerous schools in the area.

The &quot;P-I&#x27;s&quot; current &quot;Webtowns&quot; section has merged Wedgwood and View Ridge with Sand Point and two popular waterfront parks, Magnuson Park and Matthews Beach Park. &quot;Webtowns&quot; Wedgwood is located between Sand Point Way and a small business district on 35th Avenue NE around NE 75th Street. The neighborhood is described as less expensive, though with respect to Seattle housing prices, the comparison is relative to places with expansive views in tonier adjacent neighborhoods like View Ridge and Sand Point, or high demand like the University District.

National standards long adopted by the Seattle Department of Transportation define minor arterials, in part, as generally along neighborhood boundaries: NE 65th, 75th, and 95th streets, and 35th Avenue.

<text>Stranorlar () is a town, townland and civil parish in the Finn Valley of County Donegal, in Ireland. Stranorlar and Ballybofey (located on the other side of the River Finn) form the twin towns of Ballybofey–Stranorlar.

==History==
=== Built heritage ===
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of ring fort and holy well sites in the townlands of Stranorlar, Mullandrait, Lough Hill and Admiran. Stranorlar&#x27;s Church of Ireland church, St John&#x27;s Church in Glebe townland, was built . Isaac Butt (1813–1879), founder of the Home Rule movement, is buried in its churchyard. 

=== Drumboe killings ===
In November 1922, during the Irish Civil War, a column of Anti-Treaty IRA irregulars from the 2nd Northern Division were captured at Dunlewey in west Donegal by the National Army and held in Drumboe Castle outside Stranorlar. On 14 March 1923, they were taken from the castle to the nearby Drumboe woods and summarily executed.

There is a memorial to the four men near the Church of Ireland and Bus Éireann depot buildings, and since 1924 there has been a commemoration march to the monument each year by republicans. The four executed men were:

* Charlie Daly (26), from Knockane, Firies, County Kerry;
* Daniel Enright (23), from Patrick Street, Listowel, County Kerry; 
* Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan (23), Patrick Street, Listowel, County Kerry;
* Seán Larkin (26), Ballagherty, Magherafelt, County Londonderry.

==Transport==
The town is located at the junction of the N15 and N13 national primary roads. For nearly 100 years, Stranorlar was the headquarters of the County Donegal Railway system (originally the Finn Valley Railway), with services to Derry and Letterkenny via Strabane (near Lifford), to Ballyshannon and Killybegs via Donegal, and to Glenties. At its peak, the railway had 130 employees. The last train ran from Stranorlar in 1960. As of the 21st century, the nearest operational railway station is the Northern Ireland Railways station, Derry~Londonderry railway station, in Derry.

Stranorlar railway station was built by the Finn Valley Railway and opened on 7 September 1863 and closed on 6 February 1960. The old railway station was demolished to make way for a new bus garage owned and run by Bus Éireann. As part of a series of millennium celebrations, the old clock from the railway station was restored and installed in a new clock tower which sits at the old pedestrian entrance to the railway station yard. The town remains the main depot for Bus Éireann within County Donegal.

The town is served by the Bus Éireann No. 64 (Derry/Galway) service which connects the town to Donegal Town, Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Sligo and Letterkenny. There is also a regular service to Lifford and Strabane. TFI Local Link routes 264 (Ballyshannon/Letterkenny), 288 (Ballybofey/Derry), 290 (Ballybofey/Letterkenny), 988 (Cloghan/Letterkenny) and 1426 (Stranorlar/Convoy/Derry) also service the area.

==Education==
Stranorlar is home to St. Columba&#x27;s College and Finn Valley College. The town is also home to three primary schools. St Mary&#x27;s primary school, Robertson National School and the Sessiaghoneil school.

==Religion==

The town&#x27;s Church of Ireland church, St John&#x27;s Church, is a registered monument. The Catholic church of St Mary is a nineteenth-century structure. There is also a Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland church and a Presbyterian Church of Ireland church in the town.

==Sport==
The local athletics club, Finn Valley Athletics Club, has a track in the town. Stranorlar is home to Finn Valley Rugby Club.

There is also an 18-hole golf course in the area, and game fishing occurs in the River Finn. Nearby is the Lough Alann bird sanctuary.

==Tourism==
Drumboe Woods are a tourist attraction at Stranorlar. The woods are managed by Coillte and provide walking routes along the banks of the River Finn and the upper woods. Outside the town, a small folly called &quot;The Steeple&quot; is a destination for walkers. From the top of the tower, on a clear day, the hillfort of the Grianan of Aileach can be seen. There is a raised ring fort at Dunwiley, outside the town.

There are a number of guest houses in the town and on the main street is Stranorlar&#x27;s only hotel. Kee&#x27;s Hotel is a family-run hotel, first established in the 19th century as a coach house.

<doc id="1303246" wikidata="Q2740919" url="?curid=1303246" title="BNY Mellon Center (Pittsburgh)">
<text>BNY Mellon Center is a 55-story skyscraper located at 500 Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Standing tall, it is the second-tallest building in the city. Announced on March 27, 1980, the tower was completed in June 1984. It was initially planned to be the world headquarters of the Dravo Corporation (now Carmeuse Corporation) by its majority owner at the time and current neighbor U.S. Steel until Dravo was purchased in 1983. Upon opening, the building was named One Mellon Center after Mellon Financial Corporation, which used the tower as the company&#x27;s global headquarters. In 2007, the company merged with Bank of New York to form The Bank of New York Mellon; the resulting corporation continues to use the building as one of its major offices. In 2008, the building was renamed to its current moniker as part of a branding initiative by The Bank of New York Mellon.

Prominent features of the building include its eight-sided design and mansard roof. The tower is connected to the U.S. Steel Tower through a tunnel which passes through Steel Plaza subway station. BNY Mellon Center is the ninth-tallest building in Pennsylvania (as well as the second-tallest within the state outside of Philadelphia) and 195th-tallest skyscraper in the world, and also the building with the highest taxable property value in Allegheny County, surpassing even the U.S. Steel Tower. On clear days, it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away, usually from the top of Chestnut Ridge.

==History==

The 500 block of Grant Street was for decades the site of the Carlton Hotel, Plaza Building and the &quot;Interlude Lounge&quot; across the street from the Allegheny County Courthouse on the current complex&#x27;s southern extreme. In the early 1980s, U.S. Steel, which has its global headquarters one block north at the U.S. Steel Tower bought the land Mellon Center was to be built on and planned a 54-floor skyscraper replacing the Carlton Hotel and Plaza Buildings. The naming rights originally went to the Pittsburgh manufacturing firm Dravo Corporation and was to serve as their leased headquarters space (while still owned by U.S. Steel). After the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s combined with the rapid deindustrialization of the 1980s, Dravo was bought out by a foreign conglomerate and its regional facilities were shuttered. U.S. Steel, having diversified into oil and other industries, sold the almost completed skyscraper on February 16, 1983, to a Connecticut Limited Partnership, the 500 Grant Street Partners, for what was then the second-largest real estate purchase in Western Pennsylvania history.

In March 2010, installation began on a new rooftop sign that would replace the old Mellon signage with the company&#x27;s new triangular logo and the new brand name &quot;BNY Mellon&quot;. The effort lasted until the end of 2010.

On Monday, March 29, 2010, at approximately 4:30 p.m., a maintenance worker committed suicide by intentionally falling from the roof. The worker who died, from the North Side region of the city, was a 10-year employee of the building&#x27;s maintenance contractor.

The BNY Mellon lease ends in 2028 and the building&#x27;s future after that is uncertain.

==Popular culture==
The skyscraper features prominently in the 1983 film &quot;Flashdance&quot; (while still under construction) and the 1998 Michael Keaton film &quot;Desperate Measures&quot; (serving as part of the &quot;hospital&quot;). It also makes cameos in &quot;Sudden Death&quot;, &quot;Striking Distance&quot; and the 2010 rap video &quot;Black and Yellow&quot;.

<doc id="1303256" wikidata="Q7979192" url="?curid=1303256" title="Wedgwood Rock">
<text>Wedgwood Rock is a glacial erratic (known to geologists as the Wedgwood Erratic) near the neighborhood of Wedgwood in Seattle, Washington. Its mineral composition matches that of Mount Erie, on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County, Washington, north. Prior to the establishment of the Wedgwood neighborhood, the erratic was known first as Lone Rock and later simply as Big Rock. Transported to its site by the Puget Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Vashon Glaciation more than 14,000 years ago, it was a landmark for Native Americans in what was once a dense forest.

Today, the rock sits in a residential neighborhood on 28th Avenue NE, near NE 72nd Street, still surrounded by trees and brush, and kept clear by local residents.

==19th century==
In 1881, the rock, known at the time as Lone Rock, was part of the farm of William Weedin. An anonymous 1881 letter to the Seattle &quot;Daily Intelligencer&quot; about a Fourth of July picnic at the rock described it as &quot;in a dense forest&quot; on Weedin&#x27;s land, and as &quot;a single rock in circumference and in height, rather oval-shaped, covered with a solid network of moss and interspersed with liquorice, with its graceful fern-shaped foliage hanging in festoons around it.&quot; This rock has an estimated mass of .

In 1888 the Weedin property passed to Mary Miller, widow of William Miller. William Miller, an ally of Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens, fought in the Puget Sound War and Yakima War of 1856–1857.

==20th century and later==
By the early 20th century, the rock was known as Big Rock. With the Miller family&#x27;s permission, members of Seattle&#x27;s Mountaineers Club practiced their rock climbing techniques there. Edmond S. Meany, president of Mountaineers and a professor at the nearby University of Washington brought his students to the rock to learn about glacial movement and land forms. Later, Boy Scouts also learned to climb there, taught by German-born climber and scout leader Wolf Bauer. REI founder Lloyd Anderson taught Mountaineers and Boy Scouts at the rock. Among the prominent climbers whose training started at Big Rock were German-born Fred Beckey and Jim Whittaker, who became the first American to reach the top of Mount Everest.

Mary Miller&#x27;s son Winlock Miller, a member of the U.W. Board of Regents and a promoter of Mount Rainier National Park, kept the land around the rock undeveloped into the 1940s. He sold in the 1940s to developer Albert Balch, who promised Miller that the area immediately around the rock would be preserved as a park, but failed to keep the promise. In 1946, a citizens group tried and failed to convince the Seattle City Council to preserve the area as a park against landowner Balch&#x27;s wishes.

Although surrounded by houses, the rock remained a destination for picnickers, university students, climbers, and, in the 1960s, hippies. In reaction to the hippies and their perceived drug use, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance in 1970 making it a crime to climb the rock, punishable by a fine up to $100.

<text>The Daily News was a tabloid newspaper in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that was published from 1974 until ceasing operations in February 2008.

==History==
&quot;The Daily News&quot; owed its existence to David Bentley, who, along with his wife Diana and Patrick and Joyce Sims, founded The Great Eastern News Company Ltd. in 1974 and started publishing a weekly broadsheet named &quot;The Bedford-Sackville News&quot;. This paper focused on the suburban communities of Bedford and Lower Sackville within the Halifax-Dartmouth metropolitan area.

The Great Eastern News Company Ltd. was initially published out of Bentley&#x27;s home but a press was acquired in 1978 and the company moved into a new building. A year later the format changed to a tabloid and began publishing six days a week as &quot;The Bedford-Sackville Daily News&quot;. The paper gained a reputation for printing stories not covered by its competition, &quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot;, some of which were considered sensational. In 1981, Bentley&#x27;s company moved to downtown Halifax from its suburban base and redubbed its tabloid as &quot;The Daily News&quot;, while gaining a reputation for hard-hitting stories and expanded sports coverage.

In 1985 the Newfoundland Capital Corporation gained a controlling interest in the paper and complete ownership in 1987 which resulted in a move to Dartmouth. The paper was subsequently redesigned and a press upgrade made it one of the first papers in Atlantic Canada to incorporate colour; on October 2, 1988 it became the first paper in the region to publish a Sunday edition. Under NCC ownership, the tendency for sensational coverage was tempered as the paper became more mainstream.

On July 1, 1997 NCC sold the paper to Southam Newspapers, which was controlled by Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger Corporation. On November 15, 2000, Hollinger sold &quot;The Daily News&quot;, along with the majority of its major Southam papers to CanWest Global Communications in what was termed the biggest media deal in Canadian history.

Over several years, CanWest Global attempted to use &quot;The Daily News&quot; to bolster its news team at its Global Maritimes TV station, however this ended on August 9, 2002 when the paper was sold to GTC Transcontinental Inc., along with other former Southam properties in eastern and western Canada.

GTC Transcontinental redesigned the paper in 2003, maintaining the tabloid format and relocated it from Dartmouth to downtown Halifax.

==Closure==
On February 11, 2008, GTC Transcontinental executives made a surprise announcement to staff and readers that &quot;The Daily News&quot; would cease publication effective immediately, citing declining advertising revenue and circulation subscriptions.

&quot;The Daily News&quot; was replaced with a local version of the free &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper aimed primarily at commuters.

A total of 92 staff members from the newsroom, circulation department, and printing plant were given severance packages based upon 2 weeks salary per year of employment with the newspaper. The Halifax edition of &quot;Metro&quot; has rehired 20 staff members while other staff may be placed with GTC Transcontinental newspapers elsewhere in Atlantic Canada.

<doc id="1303260" wikidata="Q3143670" url="?curid=1303260" title="Hyder Consulting">
<text>Hyder Consulting was a multi-national advisory and design consultancy with particular specialisation in the transport, property, utilities and environmental sectors. The firm employed approximately 4,200 people across the UK, Europe, Germany, Middle East, Asia and Australia and had been listed on the London Stock Exchange since October 2002. The name Hyder is the Welsh word for &quot;confidence&quot;.

In October 2014 it was acquired by Arcadis NV.

==History==
Hyder was formed in 1993 when engineering firms Acer Group and Wallace Evans Ltd were acquired by Welsh Water and subsequently merged.

Acer Group was itself an internationally recognised consultancy practice formed in 1987 by the merger of John Taylor and Sons (established 1739) and Freeman Fox and Partners (established 1857), and joined in 1991 by Sir Bruce White, Wolfe Barry, and Partners.

Hyder Consulting was subsequently acquired by Western Power Distribution, which prompted Hyder&#x27;s senior management to instigate a management buy-out that was completed in January 2001. The firm was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in October 2002.

Freeman Fox and Partners had been involved in Melbourne&#x27;s West Gate Bridge disaster in 1970. Thirty-five construction workers were killed and 18 injured in the collapse, and it remains Australia&#x27;s worst industrial accident to this day.
 Other structures involving Freeman Fox and Partners included the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932), the Adomi Bridge (1957) and the Erskine Bridge (1971).

<doc id="1303261" wikidata="Q687428" url="?curid=1303261" title="Maria Bartiromo">
<text>Maria Sara Bartiromo (born September 11, 1967) is an American conservative journalist and author who has also worked as a financial reporter and news anchor. She is the host of &quot;Mornings with Maria&quot; and &quot;Maria Bartiromo&#x27;s Wall Street&quot; on the Fox Business channel, and &quot;Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo&quot; on the Fox News channel.

Bartiromo worked at CNN as a producer for five years before joining CNBC in 1993, where she worked on-air for 20 years. With CNBC, she was the host of &quot;Closing Bell&quot; and &quot;On the Money with Maria Bartiromo&quot;. She was the first television journalist to deliver live television reports from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. She has won several awards for her work on these programs, including two Emmy Awards. Nicknamed the &quot;Money Honey&quot;, she garnered considerable attention within the financial industry in addition to the media. Her work for CNBC was largely non-political in its subject matter and approach. She sits on the boards of a number of non-profit and civic organizations.

In 2013, she left CNBC to host shows for Fox. During the first presidency of Donald Trump, she became an advocate for the Trump administration, giving him frequent unchallenging interviews. She is one of three Fox Corporation program hosts named in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit by Smartmatic relating to unproven conspiracy theories used in attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. As of April 2023, the lawsuit was in the discovery phase. Bartiromo was among the hosts named in the &quot;Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network&quot; defamation lawsuit for broadcasting false statements about the plaintiff company&#x27;s voting machines that Fox News settled for $787.5 million and required Fox News to acknowledge that the broadcast statements were false.

==Early life and education==
Bartiromo was born to Italian-American parents Vincent and Josephine Bartiromo, and was raised in the Dyker Heights area of Brooklyn in New York City. Her father owned the Rex Manor restaurant in Brooklyn, and her mother served as the hostess. Her mother also worked as a clerk at an off-track betting parlor. Her mother&#x27;s family was from Agrigento, Sicily. Her grandfather Carmine Bartiromo immigrated to the United States from Nocera, Campania in 1933, settling in New York and serving in the US Armed Forces.

Bartiromo attended Fontbonne Hall Academy, an all-girls private Catholic school in Bay Ridge. During this time, she worked at the coat check at her father&#x27;s restaurant and as a stock clerk at a wedding dress shop. She was fired from the latter for trying on newly arrived dresses before putting them away; she recalled &quot;I cried the whole way home, but I learned a valuable lesson and that is – do your job.&quot;

Bartiromo started college at C. W. Post before transferring to New York University. During her college years, she worked at the same betting parlor where her mother worked. She graduated from NYU&#x27;s Washington Square Campus in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism and economics.

While at NYU she became involved with radio, interning on Barry Farber&#x27;s show on WMCA 570. Farber was impressed by her willingness and capability in doing behind-the-scenes tasks associated with the role. Following that, she interned at CNN.

==Career==
===CNN===

After her internship, which began in 1988 or 1989, Bartiromo spent five years as an executive producer and assignment editor with CNN Business. Her supervisor at CNN was Lou Dobbs, who later became a colleague at Fox Business. She also worked as a production assistant for Stuart Varney there.

===CNBC===
====Live from the stock exchange floor====
In 1993, Bartiromo was hired by executive Roger Ailes to replace analyst Roy Blumberg at CNBC, and began reporting live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, as well as hosting and contributing to the &quot;Market Watch&quot; and &quot;Squawk Box&quot; segments. Bartiromo became the first journalist to deliver live television reports from the raucous floor of New York Stock Exchange. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper described the scene as, &quot;viewers could watch Bartiromo amid the tumult on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, straining her voice to be heard as she delivered reports to camera ..., her 5ft 5in frame [1.65m] often jostled by burly traders. &quot; She has said of that innovation: &quot;I got bumped around a little, but it was very exciting — a new, instantaneous way of reporting market news. We immediately had a big following. &quot;

Bartiromo was the anchor and managing editor of the CNBC business interview show &quot;On the Money with Maria Bartiromo&quot; (called &quot;The Wall Street Journal Report&quot; during much of this time). Beginning in 2007, she hosted &quot;The Business of Innovation&quot;. She hosted several other programs, including &quot;Closing Bell&quot; (2002–2013), &quot;Market Wrap&quot; (1998–2000), and &quot;Business Center&quot; (1997–1999). She became known for the ability to get CEOs of companies in the news to come on her show for an interview. She became influential.

====&quot;Money Honey&quot;====
Bartiromo appeared on television shows such as NBC Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, CBS Television Distribution&#x27;s &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, Warner Bros. Television&#x27;s short-lived &quot;The Caroline Rhea Show&quot;, CNBC&#x27;s even shorter-existing &quot;McEnroe&quot;, and Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, as well as guest-hosting on the syndicated &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;.

Over the years, writers for multiple media outlets have commented on her good looks and likened her appearance to that of the Italian actress Sophia Loren. It is a comparison that Bartiromo has acknowledged and welcomed as a compliment.

Bartiromo was nicknamed the &quot;Money Honey&quot; in the mid-to-late 1990s, a moniker that she had conflicted feelings about lest it diminish her credibility as a financial journalist. In January 2007, Bartiromo filed trademark applications to use the term &quot;Money Honey&quot; as a brand name for a line of children&#x27;s products, including toys, puzzles and coloring books, to teach kids about money. By some accounts she later let the trademarks expire.

====Continued prominence====

Bartiromo anchored the television coverage of New York City&#x27;s Columbus Day Parade beginning in 1995 and was the Grand Marshal in 2010.

In 2006–07 there was controversy over Bartiromo possibly being too close socially to some of the executives she was covering, which included overseas trips with some such sources. In part, that was part and parcel of her role to add &quot;pizazz and drama&quot;. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;in her years as CNBC&#x27;s most recognizable face, [she] has lent to the reporting of once gray business news a veneer of gloss and celebrity.&quot; But the &quot;Times&quot; noted that: &quot;Typically, Ms. Bartiromo&#x27;s interviewing style can be probing, aggressive and, her special access notwithstanding, she can make even some of her best sources sweat a bit on camera. &quot; CNBC defended her on the matter, saying that the trips in question were properly approved and that &quot;her journalistic integrity was never compromised&quot;, and Bartiromo retained the confidence of NBC upper management.

Following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which featured the collapse of some Wall Street firms and the federal bailouts of others, Bartiromo commented in an interview: &quot;I&#x27;m a free-market capitalist who would like to think that the market can correct itself. Unfortunately, the structures we have in place dropped the ball. The boards of directors were asleep at the wheel. So were the regulators. I believe that so-called independent boards of directors should be held accountable for their firms, too. Wall Street today faces the wrath of their shareholders and the scorn of the public. There&#x27;s got to be substantial change from within to regain public trust. &quot;

Bartiromo signed a new five-year contract with CNBC in late 2008 (). Her salary there was around $4 million a year. Former colleague Dylan Ratigan has said that Bartiromo &quot;is a generational icon for financial television. Full stop. &quot;

=== Fox Business and Fox News ===
==== Early years and ratings ====

On November 18, 2013, it was announced that Bartiromo was leaving CNBC to join Fox Business (FBN). According to the &quot;Drudge Report&quot;, her deal with Fox Business called for her to anchor a daily market hours program and to have a role on Fox News as well. Her first show with Fox Business was &quot;Opening Bell with Maria Bartiromo&quot;. She expanded the subject domains she covered to include not just the stock market but also larger questions of public policy and the overall economy.

Since her time with the Fox Business channel, the ratings for her show began to surge when she became an important news source for Trump supporters.

====Presidential debate host====
The developments of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race benefited her ratings, as she developed an on-air relationship with Trump.

In regard to the 2016 Republican Party presidential debates and forums, she was one of three moderators for Fox Business of the debate of November 10, 2015 at the Milwaukee Theatre and she and her colleagues were credited with keeping a focus on economics and for overseeing a largely civil discussion among the candidates. She even drew some boos from the audience for suggesting that likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had much more relevant experience than the candidates on stage. She then co-hosted on Fox Business another Republican debate, this time on January 14, 2016 in the North Charleston Coliseum, one that was not previously planned but awarded on the basis of the first performance. One assessment of the North Charleston debate was that the moderators were initially mild but got tougher as the debate went on and delved more into matters economic.

During the 2016 general election, she commented on the differing ways that Wall Street would react to either candidate winning. She received a good deal of attention during this period for her sartorial choices for the traditional Al Smith Dinner. But as the election ran on towards its conclusion, Bartiromo took an increasingly sharp pro-Trump stance, such as repeating trolling Internet posts attacking Clinton.

==== Donald Trump presidency ====
After Trump became president in 2017, she became an advocate for the Trump administration, frequently repeating administration talking points. She also gave friendly, non-challenging softball interviews to Trump and amplified Trump administration conspiracy theories and falsehoods. In her Trump interviews, she expressed agreement with and did not question Trump&#x27;s claims, many of which had been debunked as false or unsubstantiated. Making reference to allegations that Trump&#x27;s predecessor, Barack Obama, used the U.S. intelligence community to spy on the Trump campaign and transition, Bartiromo said that 2016 requests by Obama administration officials to unmask the identity of an American who was the subject of a counterintelligence operation (who turned out to be Trump associate Michael Flynn) was &quot;the biggest political scandal we&#x27;ve ever seen. &quot; Attorney general Bill Barr named federal prosecutor John Bash to lead an investigation, which concluded months later with no findings of substantive wrongdoing and no public report.

In late November 2020, after Trump lost his bid for reelection, Bartiromo conducted the first post-election interview with Trump. Before the interview, Bartiromo texted Mark Meadows, then Trump&#x27;s chief of staff, with advice that included questions she planned to ask Trump. In the interview, she backed Trump&#x27;s false claims of election fraud and his attempt to overturn the election results, claiming that Trump was being overthrown in a &quot;coup&quot;. Bartiromo was criticized for her conduct in the 45-minute interview, in which she never asked Trump to substantiate his claims of fraud. Brian Stelter of CNN contrasted his recall of Bartiromo&#x27;s earlier career to his perception of her time spent interviewing Trump as &quot;Maria Bartiromo, once a feared and acclaimed journalist, best known for working the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, forcing CEOs to tell the truth, now sits behind a desk and invites the president to lie and lie and lie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benveniste_11/29/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trump praised Bartiromo as being &quot;brave&quot; for her approach to discussing the disputes. Bartiromo then defended herself by claiming that much of the media, such as CNN and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, were taking a side and engaging in &quot;election interference&quot;. In his November 2021 book, &quot;Betrayal&quot;, former ABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl reported a November 2020 incident when Bartiromo called attorney general Bill Barr &quot;to complain that the DOJ hadn&#x27;t done anything to stop the Democrats from stealing the election.&quot; Barr told Karl, &quot;She called me up and she was screaming. I yelled back at her. She&#x27;s lost it. &quot;

==== Promoter of &quot;election fraud&quot; falsehoods ====
According to media reporter Brian Stelter, Bartiromo&#x27;s unsourced and poorly sourced on-air conversation with Sidney Powell on November 8, 2020, largely started the network&#x27;s false and potentially defamatory claims about the election, which Trump lost—Bartiromo did no fact checking, no push back, nor even ask for evidence, merely repeating &quot;unhinged&quot; and false claims. 
Bartiromo was an outspoken proponent on her program of baseless allegations that rigged voting machines stole the election from Donald Trump. Hosts Lou Dobbs and Jeanine Pirro also promoted the falsehoods on their programs. Attorneys for Smartmatic, a voting machine company that had been baselessly accused of conspiring with competitor Dominion Voting Systems to rig the election, sent Fox News a letter in December 2020 threatening legal action and demanding retractions that &quot;must be published on multiple occasions&quot; so as to &quot;match the attention and audience targeted with the original defamatory publications.&quot; The three programs each ran the same three-minute video segment refuting the baseless allegations days later, consisting of an election security expert being interviewed by an unseen and unidentified man, though none of the three hosts personally issued retractions. In February 2021, Smartmatic filed a $2.7 billion defamation suit against Fox News, three of its hosts, including Bartiromo, and two network guests. A New York State Supreme Court judge ruled in March 2022 that the suit against Fox News could proceed, dismissing allegations against two individuals but allowing claims against Bartiromo to stand.

In January 2021, after the storming of the U.S. Capitol that was carried out by a mob of supporters of Trump, Bartiromo hosted Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro on her show, where he falsely claimed in the interview that Trump had won the election. Bartiromo concurred, falsely claiming, &quot;We know that there were irregularities in this election. &quot; In a broadcast on January 19, she falsely claimed that Democrats wore MAGA clothing and were behind the storming of the Capitol. In July 2021, Bartiromo referenced Ashli Babbitt, who was shot while part of a pro-Trump mob trying to push through a barricaded door inside the U.S. Capitol building, a &quot;wonderful woman&quot; who &quot;went to peaceful protest.&quot;

In October 2024, Bartiromo promoted a story from &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, a far-right fake news website, claiming that Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes was trying to &quot;hide&quot; an &quot;election integrity problem&quot; in Arizona.

====Ratings success====

Five years after joining the fledgling network, both her shows and the channel itself was surpassing CNBC in audience size some of the time. In September 2019, she signed a new multi-year deal with FBN. That year, TheStreet.com reported that Bartiromo had an annual salary of $10 million, seventh highest among American television news anchors of any kind.

During the latter part of January 2021, at the outset of the Biden administration, Fox News gave Bartiromo a trial run to head one of Fox News&#x27; primetime slots, the new weekday 7 p.m. &quot;Fox News Primetime&quot; political opinions show. Her guest hosting stint began the week of January 25, 2021. She did not get the time slot.

<text>Joliette station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is located in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. The station opened on June 6, 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand station.

== Overview ==
Designed by architect Marcel Raby, it is a normal side platform station built in tunnel. The walls of the platform have a unique yellow brick façade. It has no transept, with closed staircases leading to the mezzanine above; this gives access to two exits, one on either side of rue Hochelaga. The mezzanine contains a large illuminated mural sculpture by the architect, entitled &quot;Thème des mouvements du soleil&quot; (&quot;theme of the sun&#x27;s motion&quot;).

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue Joliette. Barthélémy Joliette (1789–1850) served in the House of Assembly and Legislative Council of Lower Canada; he also founded the village of L&#x27;Industrie (later Joliette, Quebec).

<doc id="1303278" wikidata="Q6382222" url="?curid=1303278" title="Kearny Connection">
<text>The Kearny Connection is a railroad junction in Kearny, New Jersey that allows passenger trains from New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Morris and Essex Lines to enter/leave Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor (NEC) and travel to and from New York Penn Station. The junction, which opened in 1996, is nearby the Sawtooth Bridges.

==Location and design==
The Kearny Connection is located west of Secaucus Junction and lies immediately north of the Waterfront Connection which serves to connect Hoboken Division with the NEC. Two tracks, one in each direction, carry trains from the former DL&amp;W main line, which passes under the NEC, onto the NEC. The new junction on the NEC is designated &quot;Swift Interlocking&quot; and is seven miles west of New York.
There is a difference in voltage/frequency between the Northeast Corridor and the Morris and Essex Lines so only electric locomotives and EMUs that can switch between the two electrical systems are able to travel through the junction.

==Predecessors==
There is precedent for trains from the Morris and Essex lines to route through a connection to a PRR-associated railroad and use its terminal for better access to New York City. The Morris and Essex Railroad, from the time of its arrival in Newark in 1836 until it established its own depot in Hoboken in 1855, built a junction with the New Jersey Rail Road (the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s predecessor) in Newark, to get to the NJRR&#x27;s Paulus Hook terminal in Jersey City and its ferries to Manhattan, although this was to the south of Hoboken rather than to the north. To be precise, the junction was with the NJRR&#x27;s Market Street branch, which joined with the NJRR main line in Newark to cross the Passaic on the Center Street Bridge, then through the Bergen Hill Cut to its Paulus Hook terminal in Jersey City. Nearly all of this has since been removed; the exceptions are tracks for PATH and the P&amp;H through the Bergen Hill Cut, and a small portion of the NJRR mainline east of the former Center Street Bridge (now called the Center Street Branch), but that is now only connected to the M&amp;E albeit further east in Kearny. 

==Impact==
With the opening of service on June 10, 1996, travel time to Midtown, Manhattan was reduced by 20 minutes, eliminating the need for riders to first travel to Hoboken Terminal and transfer to PATH trains for transport under the Hudson River. New Jersey Transit dubbed the new service Midtown Direct. By the 2000s, of 138 inbound and 150 outbound daily weekday trains on the three Morris and Essex Lines, 73 inbound and 71 outbound trains (about 50%) use the Kearny Connection.

The project&#x27;s construction took three years, and $70 million to complete. The reduced commute times and the &quot;one-seat&quot; commute provided by the Kearny Connection increased ridership on the Morris and Essex Lines and increased residential property prices along the line. In 2010, it was estimated that the state of New Jersey collected hundreds of millions of dollars annually in additional property tax revenue due to the increased property prices along the Morris and Essex Lines. 

The Kearny Connection&#x27;s popularity and success led to other transportation improvements such as the opening of the Secaucus Junction station seven years later. Additional attempts to create &quot;one-seat&quot; commutes to Midtown for riders from the Raritan Valley Line and the Montclair-Boonton Line using dual-mode Bombardier ALP-45DP locomotives have been stalled due to rush-hour capacity issues at Penn Station in New York. A proposal for &quot;one-seat&quot; commutes to Penn Station for Pascack Valley Line, Main Line and Bergen County Line riders via a loop at the Secaucus Junction station is part of the Gateway Project plan but faces criticism due to the existing overcrowding at Penn Station.

<doc id="1303286" wikidata="Q7974074" url="?curid=1303286" title="Waterfront Connection">
<text>The Waterfront Connection allows NJ Transit trains to switch from the former Pennsylvania Railroad main line (now the Newark Division) to the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad main line, now NJ Transit Rail Operations. The connection opened on September 9, 1991, at a cost of $16 million.

The connection consists of a single track that splits from the Northeast Corridor main line to New York Penn Station as it rises to go over the main line of NJ Transit Rail Operations to Hoboken. The connection rises to the east with a bridge over PATH&#x27;s westbound track and a Conrail freight line, merging into the Hoboken line from the south. The red through-girder bridge here was built for it; for its first 10+ years it was not electrified. The Waterfront Connection lies immediately south of the Kearny Connection, and serves the complementary purpose. The two connections allow any trains originating from the west of Kearny, regardless of line, to terminate at either Hoboken or New York Penn Station.

Currently the only train that uses the waterfront connection is a single inbound morning Raritan Valley Line train to Hoboken, North Jersey Coast Line trains previously used the connection to reach Hoboken with five rush hour trains in each direction originating/terminating at Hoboken. However since 2020 all trains to and from Hoboken on the North Jersey Coast Line have been cancelled and now originate and terminate exclusively at New York Penn Station. The Waterfront Connection allows diesel trains to operate direct from Hoboken to Bay Head, the last stop on the North Jersey Coast Line. Since the North Jersey Coast Line&#x27;s electrification ends at Long Branch, rush hour passengers south of Long Branch can take diesel trains all the way to Hoboken or change at Newark Penn Station for service to New York City. As of 2015, the ALP-45DP has allowed the introduction of one-seat rides from New York Penn Station all the way to Bay Head.

With the advent of the Waterfront Connection, NJ Transit no longer needed a separate fueling facility on the diesel portion of the North Jersey Coast Line since diesel engines can make the trip directly to Hoboken. Faced with pressure from Bay Head residents in 2002, the Bay Head fueling facility was shut down and trains now refuel exclusively at Hoboken or at Raritan Yard.

== Predecessor ==
As part of NJ Transit&#x27;s &quot;Bergen Shore Express&quot; summer promotion 1986–1988, NJ Transit Rail Operations trains from the Bergen County Line turned southwest at West End Junction onto the Morris &amp; Essex line, switched onto the Center Street Branch, PATH tracks, and then the Northeast Corridor to head for the North Jersey Coast Line. The switches that allowed this have since all been removed.

<text>Turning a blind eye is an idiom describing the ignoring of undesirable information. The Oxford English Dictionary records usage of the phrase in 1698. 

The phrase &quot;to turn a blind eye&quot; is often associated with Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. An orchestrated version of what actually happened gives the story that during the battle, Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, in overall command of the British forces, sent a signal to Nelson&#x27;s forces ordering them to discontinue the action. Naval orders were transmitted via a system of signal flags at that time. When this order was brought to Nelson&#x27;s attention, he lifted his telescope up to his blind eye, saying, &quot;I have a right to be blind sometimes. I really do not see the signal,&quot; and most of his forces continued to press home the attack. The frigates supporting the line of battle ships did break off, in one case suffering severe losses in the retreat.

There is a misconception that the order was to be obeyed at Nelson&#x27;s discretion, but this is contradicted by the fact that it was a general order to all the attacking ships (some of whom did break off), and that later that day Nelson openly stated that he had &quot;fought contrary to orders&quot;. Sir Hyde Parker was recalled in disgrace and Nelson was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the fleet following the battle.

<text>A concession stand, or refreshment stand (American English, Canadian English), snack kiosk or [[snack bar]] (British English, Irish English) is a place where patrons can purchase snacks or food at a cinema, amusement park, zoo, aquarium, circus, fair, stadium, beach, swimming pool, concert, sporting event, or other entertainment venue. Some events or venues contract the right to sell food to third parties. Those contracts are often referred to as a concession, hence the name for a stand where food is sold. Usually prices for goods at concession stands are greater than elsewhere for the convenience of being close to an attraction and thus often contribute significant revenue to the venue operator (especially in the case of movie theaters). Additionally, outside food and drink is often prohibited to incentivise spending at the concession stands.

==History==
Concession stands were not originally operated by the movie theaters, and food was often sold by people attending the film or by vendors outside of the theater.

Movie theaters were at first hostile to food being brought into their facilities, but during the Great Depression, theaters added concession stands as a way to increase revenue in the economically stagnant times. By the 1930s, concession stands were a main fixture in many theaters. During World War II, candy was scarce at concession stands because of the sugar rationing going on at the time, and popcorn became more popular than before.

In the late 1940s, and early 1950s, as movie ticket sales were down, sales of food at concession stands increased. In the United States, concession owners are represented by the National Association of Concessionaires and the National Independent Concessionaires Association.

<doc id="1303295" wikidata="Q593781" url="?curid=1303295" title="Flicky">
<text>is a platform game developed by Sega and released as an arcade video game in May 1984. It was licensed to Bally Midway for distribution in the United States. In &quot;Flicky&quot;, the player controls the eponymous blue bird and must gather all the small birds called Chirps in each round and bring them safely to the exit. There are cat and lizard enemies which can disperse the Chirps and kill the player, but Flicky can use items on the playing field to protect herself and the Chirps from danger.

The idea for &quot;Flicky&quot; came from Sega senior leadership, who wanted to exceed the success of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Mappy&quot; (1983). Yoji Ishii and Yoshiki Kawasaki developed &quot;Flicky&quot; at Sega over one year. Originally, the game simply had the player catch ambiguous dots in a maze. Taking inspiration from a popular song in a Japanese variety show, Kawasaki gave the game an urban theme and bird characters. The game was originally titled &quot;Busty&quot;, then &quot;Flippy&quot;, before finally settling on &quot;Flicky&quot;.

&quot;Flicky&quot; was first ported to the SG-1000 in Japan, and then later to other Japanese home consoles. In 1991, &quot;Flicky&quot; was released in North America and Europe on the Sega Genesis. The character has made cameo appearances in other Sega games, most notably within the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Flicky&quot; is a platform game in which the player takes control of a flightless blue bird named Flicky. With only the ability to run side-to-side and jump, the player must collect all the small, yellow birds called &quot;Chirps&quot; and take them to the exit to clear each round. According to game artist Yoshiki Kawasaki, Flicky is just a friend to the Chirps although some players may think she is a mother to them. The Chirps follow Flicky in a chain until they are collected at the exit. Bonus points are awarded for bringing multiple Chirps back in a single chain. There are 48 total stages. Each stage takes place on a single wraparound screen that scrolls horizontally with Flicky always in the center. After all the stages are completed, the game loops infinitely on an increased difficulty mode.

Collected Chirps will disperse if their chain comes in contact with an enemy. Some of the chirps wear sunglasses; these chirps behave more unpredictably when dispersed. There are two enemy types in the standard rounds, house cats called Tigers and green iguanas called Iggys. These enemies can be simply avoided but can also be defeated with throwable items available on some levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky can pick up an item by walking into it, and throw it by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points. There are also bonus rounds in which Flicky attempts to catch as many falling Chirps as possible in a net.

==Development==
The spark to develop &quot;Flicky&quot; came from Sega&#x27;s desire to exceed Namco&#x27;s &quot;Mappy&quot; (1983) which had become very popular in Japanese arcades. Sega game designer Yoji Ishii&#x27;s boss wanted him to design a similar &quot;dot eater&quot; game but better.

&quot;Flicky&quot; was developed over the course of one year and was designed by Yoji Ishii in collaboration with artist Yoshiki Kawasaki. The game evolved from a simple game that Kawasaki first envisioned where the player would catch dots in a maze. He took inspiration from a popular song about sparrows on power lines from a 1970s Japanese variety show, &quot;Migoro! Tabegoro! Waraigoro!&quot;, and so made the main character a sparrow and the platforms and walls wires. However, he found the power line theme boring, and thus changed the background to an apartment building after taking inspiration from one outside his office window. Kawasaki felt that anyone who is around children has experienced the emotion of wanting to keep children safe from the outside and returning them safe to their home. From this, the team wanted to imbue a message to &quot;protect the children&quot; with the game, and according to Kawasaki, &quot;it&#x27;s that emotion that drives &quot;Flicky&quot;&quot;.

Kawasaki used a poorly calibrated graphics tablet to draw all the game graphics. The Chirps were originally ambiguous dots that would disappear when collected. Kawasaki changed this so the dots trailed the player, then increased their size to 8x8 pixels to make way for a more interesting design. The size was just large enough for a simple chick design. To add difficulty to the game, some Chirps were programmed to behave more unpredictably when touched by an enemy. These Chirps were given sunglasses and deemed the &quot;bad&quot; Chirps. When game testing began, the team had created 100 levels but only four background designs, and there was barely any space left in the game. Kawasaki was able to change the colors of the backgrounds to create more variety. After testing, Iggy was added to the game.

&quot;Flicky&quot; was originally titled &quot;Busty&quot;, but an American Sega branch asked the team to change it because of the term&#x27;s slang usage in English. The game was then titled &quot;Flippy&quot; but this was changed shortly before release. In 2002, Ishii stated this was because of trademark issues in the United States, but in 2018 said it was because &quot;Flippy&quot; was too similar to &quot;Mappy&quot;. &quot;Flicky&quot; was released in arcades in May 1984.

==Ports==
&quot;Flicky&quot; was ported to the SG-1000 console. The port only retains 40 of the arcade levels, with some of them restructured, and does not feature the Iggy enemy. In addition, the behavior of the Chirps is slightly modified and some of the graphics were changed. This version was later ported to several other home platforms in Japan including the MSX, Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7 and NEC PC-8801. In 1990, Flicky was made available as a downloadable release for the Sega Meganet service for modem-equipped Sega Mega Drive systems. This version was subsequently released as a retail cartridge in North America and Europe in 1991.

==Reception==
In July 1984, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Flicky&quot; as being the second most popular table arcade unit in Japan during that period.

The Genesis port of &quot;Flicky&quot; was reviewed by multiple Western publications, most of which found the game to have highly addictive and enjoyable gameplay while criticizing it for having poor graphics and sound. Reviewers noted poor initial impressions based on appearance and sound, finding the sprites to be simple, the colors garish, and the music repetitive. However, when they began to play the game, they found that the simple appearance complemented the simple yet engaging gameplay. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described &quot;Flicky&quot; as a guilty pleasure and discussed its cute appearance in positive light. Reviewers from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; concluded that the game was aimed for children based on the game&#x27;s cuteness aesthetic, and provided lower scores accordingly. Critics from both &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and &quot;Mean Machines&quot; wrote that employees in their offices were disappearing into their game room to play &quot;Flicky&quot;. Julian from &quot;Mean Machines&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s crazy, I know, that a game so crappy, so laughably-simple and pathetic sounding as this can prove to be more addictive, more challenging and more long-lasting than virtually any other Mega Drive game, but it&#x27;s true.&quot; In 2017, Gamesradar ranked Flicky 42nd on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot;

==Legacy==
Numerous Sega video game compilations feature &quot;Flicky&quot;. A CD-enhanced version of the Genesis port was featured in &quot;Wondermega Collection&quot;, a compilation bundled with the Wondermega hybrid console in 1992. &quot;Wondermega Collection&quot; will be included as part of the Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 mini console in Japan, releasing in October 2022. The Genesis version was compiled into &quot;Game no Kanzume Vol. 1&quot; (1994), a Sega CD compilation in Japan which featured CD quality remixes of the original soundtrack. The Genesis port was also featured in &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; (2002), &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; (2006), &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (2009), &quot;Sega Mega Drive Classic Collection&quot; (2010), and even Genesis-based plug and play devices. The arcade version has been released in Japan on the &quot;Sega Ages: Memorial Collection Vol. 1&quot; (1996) for the Sega Saturn, and the &quot;Sega Memorial Selection&quot; (1998) for Windows&quot;.&quot; &quot;Flicky&quot; has also been ported to mobile devices. The first port was in 2001 for the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; line in Japan. In March 2003, a similar variant appeared on the Sonic Cafe service, again exclusive to Japan. In 2007, the Sonic Cafe port was upgraded with better graphics and ported to North America for the Sega Mobile service. The Genesis port was released on Steam in 2010.

The Flicky character has made cameo appearances in several other Sega arcade games, effectively becoming a mascot for Sega&#x27;s early arcade years. In &quot;Teddy Boy Blues&quot; (1985), she appears as a shooting target among other Sega mascots such as Pengo. In the puzzle game &quot;Bloxeed&quot;, she can be used as a special weapon to drop blocks on the playing field. She is also playable in &quot;SDI&quot; (1987) with the use of a cheat code. Flicky has a minor cameo appearance in &quot;Flash Point&quot;, where she will wish the player good luck before each round, and in the racing game &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot; (1989), where she appears on the racetrack banners and the game over screen. Flicky has also become an entire species and reoccurring minor character in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series and is featured most prominently in &quot;Sonic 3D: Flickies&#x27; Island&quot; (1996), the game mechanics of which were inspired by &quot;Flicky&quot;. Flicky has continued to have minor cameo appearances in other Sega titles, including &quot;Shenmue&quot; (1999), &quot;Gunstar Super Heroes&quot; (2005), and &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot; (2007).

<doc id="1303300" wikidata="Q3180888" url="?curid=1303300" title="John Alexander Low Waddell">
<text>Dr. John Alexander Low Waddell (January 15, 1854 – March 3, 1938, often shortened to J.A.L. Waddell and sometimes known as John Alexander Waddell) was a Canadian-American civil engineer and prolific bridge designer, with more than a thousand structures to his credit in the United States, Canada, as well as Mexico, Russia, China, Japan, and New Zealand. Waddell’s work set standards for elevated railroad systems and helped develop materials suitable for large span bridges. His most important contribution was the development of the steam-powered high-lift bridge. Waddell was a widely respected writer on bridge design and engineering theory, as well as an advocate for quality in higher education engineering programs. The company he founded in 1887, &#x27;J.A.L. Waddell, Consulting Engineer,&#x27; would eventually become the modern day Hardesty &amp; Hanover, a leading moveable bridge engineering firm. Many of Waddell&#x27;s surviving bridges are now considered historic landmarks.

==Early life and education==
John Alexander Low Waddell was born on January 15, 1854, in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada, to Robert Waddell (b. 1815) and Angeline E. Jones. His mother was the daughter of William Jones, late colonel of the 27th regiment and sheriff of the city of New York and a member of the State legislature in 1844. Waddell was the oldest child of eight. 

Homeschooled to nine years of age, Waddell was reportedly in poor health throughout his youth. He later attended Trinity College School in Port Hope until turning sixteen, when his parents sent him on a ten-month voyage to Hong Kong and Shanghai on the clipper ship N.B. Palmer. In 1875, Waddell obtained his first degree, in civil engineering, from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. In 1882 he married Ava Everett of Council Bluffs, Iowa, the daughter of prominent lawyer Horace Everett. In 1904 he earned a Doctorate of Science (D.Sc) from McGill University. 

== Career ==
Waddell began his career by returning to his homeland as a draftsman in Canada&#x27;s Department of Marine and Fisheries in Ottawa, where he spent a few months designing buoys, lanterns, and similar marine appliances. His next position came as a &#x27;rodman&#x27; (surveyor&#x27;s assistant) on the Canadian Pacific Railway.

He returned to the United States where he designed mines for a West Virginia coal company. In 1878, he returned to Rensselaer and taught mechanics courses until 1880. Waddell then traveled west, obtaining additional degrees from McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, and spending some time working at the Raymond &amp; Campbell firm in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

In July 1882, he was hired as a foreign advisor by the Meiji government of the Empire of Japan and taught at the Tokyo Imperial University while writing two books. That same year, he was also awarded an honorary Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s of Science each by McGill University.

=== Private practice ===
Waddell returned to the United States in 1886, and one year later established a private engineering practice in Kansas City, Missouri, as J.A.L. Waddell, Consulting Engineer. The firm would later evolve over the decades with various junior partners, including Ira G. Hedrick in 1899, John L. Harrington in 1907, Waddell&#x27;s own son Needham Everett in 1915, and Shortridge Hardesty in 1927. After Waddell&#x27;s death, the company became, and continues today as, Hardesty &amp; Hanover.

The company enjoyed great success with railroad clients in particular during its early years; in addition to the wide adoption of Waddell&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; truss design along the St. Louis Southwestern Railway and Nippon Railway, one 1906 newspaper article from Brownsville, Texas, reported that Dr. Waddell had been responsible for all the bridges on the International–Great Northern Railroad.

Midway through his consulting career, Waddell opened a New York City office, which soon became the firm&#x27;s headquarters in 1920 amidst the economic boom of the Roaring Twenties. Many of metropolitan area&#x27;s most important postwar infrastructure projects were awarded to the company, including the Goethals Bridge and Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge.

Waddell was also an adviser to the Ministry of Railways, Republic of China. When in China he along with Meloy was entrusted by MIT and Harvard University to talk over with National Southeastern University (later renamed National Central University and then Nanking University) and reached the agreement on founding Sino-American joint engineering college in Shanghai, but it soon ceased due to the wars outbroken in the area.

He was widely recognised, being awarded honours by Japan, Russia, China, and Italy, holding five honorary doctorates (including those from Japan, Canada, and Puerto Rico) and being elected an Honorary Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1936.

== Notable works ==
=== Truss bridge ===
One of Waddell&#x27;s earliest contributions to the field of civil engineering was the &quot;A&quot; Truss bridge. Patented in 1893, the cost-effective design allowed for cheap and rapid construction, and could easily carry the heavy loads generated by steam locomotive-powered trains. Replicated throughout the Empire of Japan and the American West and Midwest, this basic design contributed to the rapid expansion of several railway companies during the Second Industrial Revolution.

=== Vertical-lift bridge ===
Lifting and swinging bridges had been used for generations, but not on the scale that they exist today. Waddell was the first to invent a modern design, originally intended to span a short channel across Minnesota Point in the harbor of Duluth, Minnesota. His design won a city contest in 1892, but the War Department objected to the proposal. The city built an aerial transporter bridge in that location in 1905. In 1929, it was remodeled into the Aerial Lift Bridge, similar to Waddell&#x27;s design.

Waddell adapted his vertical-lift concept in 1893 and it was finally built as the South Halsted Street Lift-Bridge over the Chicago River. While the city of Chicago was the first to build a lift bridge of Waddell&#x27;s design, the second had to wait for his partnership with mechanical engineer John Lyle Harrington, formed in 1907. Waddell &amp; Harrington designed a vertical lift bridge (since demolished) for the Iowa Central Railway over the Mississippi River at Keithsburg, Illinois, in 1909. The pair designed more than two dozen more vertical lift bridges over the next five years before Harrington left in 1914, among them the ASB Bridge in Kansas City Missouri.

<doc id="1303316" wikidata="Q1892913" url="?curid=1303316" title="Pie-IX station">
<text>Pie-IX station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. The station opened in June 1976, in time for the 1976 Summer Olympics - as the station serves the Olympic Stadium and the Olympic Park. From 2023, the station will connect to the Pie-IX BRT.

== Overview ==

The station opened on June 6, 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand station, in time for the 1976 Summer Olympics. 

Designed by architect Marcel Raby, the station was built in open cut. The centre of the station is taken up with a vast mezzanine bisected by a long ticket barrier. This space, as well as a secondary access to the Angrignon platform, allows the station to handle very large crowds from the Olympic Stadium. The mezzanine gives direct underground city access to the Stadium. The station has two exits of its own, one incorporated into the stadium&#x27;s parvis, and another across the street.

=== Accessibility ===
In 2020, work began to make the station universally accessible at a cost of $81m. The work included the installation of four elevators, widened staircases, as well as extensive station renovation. The project was completed in November 2022, making Pie-IX the Metro&#x27;s 22nd accessible station.

== Artwork ==
The station includes four Olympic-themed works of art: three sculptures by the architect Marcel Raby featuring different takes on the Olympic rings, and one long mural in concrete and aluminium by Jordi Bonet entitled &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot; (&quot;stronger, higher, faster&quot; - the motto of the Olympic Games).

As part of the work to make the station accessible, an artwork by Francis Montillau was installed in spring 2023.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for Pie-IX Boulevard (pronounced &quot;pee neuf&quot;). This street was named in 1912 for Pope Pius IX (1792–1878), elected Pope in 1846.

==Connections==
From 2023, the station will also connect to the new Pie-IX BRT at Pierre-De Coubertin Boulevard. Unlike other BRT stops on Pie-IX Boulevard, the Pierre-De Coubertin stop will be located curb-side for easy access to and from the Metro station.

After shakedown off the United States East Coast and further training in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Queenfish&quot; set out on her first patrol 4 August 1944, in Luzon Strait. She joined &quot;Ed&#x27;s Eradicators&quot;, a wolf pack which also included and . The wolfpack was under the command of E. R. Swinburne, who rode aboard Eugene B. Fluckey&#x27;s &quot;Barb&quot;.

&quot;Tunny&quot; had to withdraw after being damaged by air attack, but on 31 August, &quot;Queenfish&quot; made her first kill, the 4,700-ton tanker &quot;Chiyoda Maru&quot;. On 9 September she scored twice more, on 7,097-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Toyooka Maru&quot; and 3,054-ton transport &quot;Manshu Maru&quot;.

ComSubPac ordered the Eradicators to assist another wolf pack (&quot;Ben&#x27;s Busters&quot; consisting of , , and ), in rescuing Allied prisoners of war (POWs) who had been on transports (including and ) in Japanese Convoy HI-72. The Japanese had picked up their own survivors from the wreckage, but they made no attempt to save any survivors from among the 2,100 British and Australian POWs embarked in the transports. The submarines managed to get 127 out of the water. An approaching typhoon terminated the hunt and the patrol. &quot;Queenfish&quot; put into Majuro for refit on 3 October.

=== Second and third patrols: October 1944 – January 1945 ===

&quot;Queenfish&quot;″s second war patrol was conducted in the northern part of the East China Sea. This time Loughlin had pack command as well as ship command. &quot;Loughlin&#x27;s Loopers&quot; included &quot;Barb&quot; and . On 8 November &quot;Queenfish&quot; sank 1,051-ton &quot;Keijo Maru&quot; and the 1,948-ton &quot;Hakko Maru&quot;. On 9 November, she sent 2,131-ton &quot;Chojusan Maru&quot;, a former gunboat, to the bottom. Alerted by ComSubPac to the approach of a large convoy from Manchuria carrying reinforcements for the Philippines, the &quot;Loopers&quot; and another wolfpack, the &quot;Urchins&quot;, combined to attack. &quot;Queenfish&quot; struck first on 15 November, sinking the 9,186-ton escort carrier . Over the next two days the subs destroyed eight ships of the convoy, including the 21,000-ton carrier and the largest of the troop transports. The attacks cost the Imperial Japanese Army defending the Philippines the bulk of a division.

Having received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first two patrols, &quot;Queenfish&quot; spent her third war patrol, 29 December to 29 January 1945, in the Formosa Straits and waters adjacent to the China coast without sinking any ships.

=== Fourth and fifth patrols: February – April 1945 ===

&quot;Queenfish&quot; returned to the same area for her fourth war patrol, 24 February to 14 April, as a member of another wolf pack. Cdr. William S. Post, Jr., the senior commanding officer in , also had in his wolfpack, &quot;Post&#x27;s Panzers&quot;, the second of that name. After &quot;Spot&quot; expended all her torpedoes, she left to reload; pack command devolved on Loughlin.

On 1 April &quot;Queenfish&quot; sank 11,600-ton passenger-cargo ship , killing 2,003 people. The ship had been guaranteed safe passage by the United States government, since she was to carry Red Cross relief supplies to Japanese POW camps. The sinking occurred in fog, and &quot;Awa Maru&quot; was not sounding her fog horn, as required by international treaty. The incident caused considerable controversy. When the one survivor picked up by &quot;Queenfish&quot;, Kantaro Shimoda, told his story, &quot;Queenfish&quot; was ordered back to port; Loughlin was relieved of command, tried by court-martial and convicted of one of three charges, negligence in obeying orders and received a &quot;Letter of Admonition&quot; from the Secretary of the Navy. Loughlin survived the war, and though he never again commanded a vessel, he continued his career and eventually attained flag rank.

On 12 April &quot;Queenfish&quot; rescued the 13-man crew of a U.S. Navy PB4Y-2 aircraft of VPB-108 which ditched on 8 April after becoming lost. &quot;Queenfish&quot; spent her fifth patrol under Cdr. Frank N. Shamer on lifeguard duty in the East China Sea-Yellow Sea area. She was at Midway preparing for another patrol when the war ended.

=== Post-World War II operations, 1945 – 1963 ===

After overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, &quot;Queenfish&quot; assumed duties as flagship, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. Homeported at Pearl Harbor after the war, &quot;Queenfish&quot; returned to the Far East during March 1946 and in June–July 1949, but spent most of the period to 1950 in training operations in the eastern Pacific. In late 1947 she operated in the Bering Sea.

In February and March 1950 &quot;Queenfish&quot; took part in combined Operations with units of the U.S. Pacific and British Fleets. She made cruises to Korean waters in 1951 and 1953. In February 1954 she sailed to her new homeport of San Diego. The next four years were spent operating off the west coast of the United States, with the exception of two weeks in Hawaii in late 1956. On 16 January 1958 she departed for a six-month deployment to WestPac, returning to San Diego 27 July to resume operations off the west coast of the United States.

&quot;Queenfish&quot; was reclassified AGSS-393 1 July 1960. She decommissioned and was struck from the Navy List 1 March 1963. Slated for scrapping, she was instead sunk as target by the nuclear-powered submarine on 14 August 1963.

<doc id="1303318" wikidata="Q708871" url="?curid=1303318" title="Milorg">
<text>Milorg (abbreviation of militær organisasjon – military organization) was the main Norwegian resistance movement during World War II. Resistance work included intelligence gathering, sabotage, supply-missions, raids, espionage, transport of goods imported to the country, release of Norwegian prisoners and escort for citizens fleeing the border to neutral Sweden.

==History==
Following the German occupation of Norway in April 1940, Milorg was formed in May 1941 as a way of organizing the various groups that wanted to participate in an internal military resistance. At first, Milorg was not well coordinated with the Special Operations Executive (SOE), the British organization to plan and lead resistance in occupied countries. In November 1941 the Milorg became integrated with the High Command of the Norwegian government in exile in London, answering to the British Army&#x27;s Department British Field Office IV, which dealt with sabotage operations, but Milorg&#x27;s British counterpart, SOE, was still operating independently. This lack of coordination led to a number of deadly incidents, creating bitterness within Milorg. SOE changed its policy at the end of 1942, and from then on Milorg and SOE efforts were coordinated.
Mainly for fear of retaliation, like the Telavåg tragedy in 1942, Milorg kept a low profile at first. But they became more active as the war progressed.
Its first permanent bases were established in the summer of 1944. At the time of the German capitulation on 8 May 1945, Milorg had been able to train and supply 40,000 soldiers. They then also played an important part in stabilizing the country.

===Two-way radio stations===
Twenty of the around 80 radio stations were uncovered, leading to the deaths of at least 20 radio operators in combat or prison. The radio station in the loft of Kvinneklinikken, was raided on 1 April 1944. Knut Haugland shot four of the raiders, and escaped. &quot;Corncrake&quot; (at Flaskebekk) transmitted from 2 April and it was raided on 4 July. Deaths included one German and two Norwegians on site, and one Norwegian at the hospital. The radio stations contributed to Milorg getting a key role in the Nazi home management program (&quot;Hjemmefrontens Ledelse&quot;), because the majority of HL&#x27;s communications abroad, went through Milorg&#x27;s radio network.

==Organisation==
Milorg was organised as a council and 14 districts.

*&quot;Rådet&quot; (&quot;The Council&quot;) had between 2–4 members. (In practice, The council ceased to exist from January 1945, when it only consisted of Sven Arntzen and Hauge—both of them being representatives in the leadership of Hjemmefronten (HL), as Milorg&#x27;s and Krigspolitiet&#x27;s representatives, respectively.)
*&quot;Den sentrale ledelse&quot; (SL)—&quot;the central leadership&quot;—was subordinate to The council.

===Military Committee===
The Military Committee (&quot;Militærkommiteen&quot;) was subordinate to The council.

===Districts===
*District 13 was the Oslo region.
*D-18 was Sørlandet.
It counted around 20,000 people by the summer of 1942.

===Sub-organizations===
There were export organisations (for transporting fugitive members, to another nation). SL had one, codenamed &quot;Edderkoppen&quot; (&quot;The Spider&quot;).

==Members==
*Lorentz Brinch
*Arne Laudal
*Knut Møyen
*Terje Rollem
*Reidun Røed
*Hjalmar Steenstrup
*Andreas Tømmerbakke
*Herman Watzinger
*Eva Kløvstad District Chief of D-25, who worked under codename Jakob
*Elsa Endresen (codenamed Lotte) (In the last year of the war, Hauge told colleagues in SL, on occasion that &quot;This is so dangerous, that only Lotte can do it!&quot;)
*Josef Haraldsen, District Chief of Vestfold, who for years after the war, served as a private in the Home Guard

===&quot;The Council&quot;&#x27;s leaders===
*Council position &quot;R1&quot;: Ole Berg, replaced by Olaf Helset, replaced by Arnold Rørholt (May 1943 – January 1945; no replacement)
*Council spot &quot;R2&quot;: Johan Holst, Johan Gørrisen, Sven Arntzen
*&quot;R3&quot;: Jacob Schive, Carl Semb, Harald Lohne, Jens Christian Hauge
*&quot;R4: Johan Beichman, Ola Brandstorp (Feb.42 – Dec. 43; no replacement)

<text>Johannes Heinrich August Ebrard (18 January 1818 – 23 July 1888) was a German Protestant theologian.

==Biography==
Born at Erlangen, he was educated in his native town and at Berlin, and after teaching in a private family became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Erlangen (1841) and then professor of theology at Zürich (1844). In 1847 he was appointed professor of theology at Erlangen, a chair which he resigned in 1861; in 1875 he became pastor of the French reformed church in the same city.

As a critic, Ebrard occupied a very moderate standpoint; as a writer his chief works were &quot;Christliche Dogmatik&quot; (2 volumes, 1851), &#x27; (1864), and &quot;Apologetik&quot; (1874–1875, Eng. trans. 1886). His work on John&#x27;s Gospel, &#x27; was published in 1845.

He also edited and completed Hermann Olshausen&#x27;s commentary, himself writing the volumes on the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Johannine epistles, and Revelation. In the department of &quot;belles-lettres&quot; he wrote a good deal under such pseudonyms as Christian Deutsch, Gottfried Flammberg and Sigmund Sturm.

<text>Bruce Jay Wasserstein (December 25, 1947 – October 14, 2009) was an American investment banker, businessman, and writer. He was prominent in the mergers and acquisitions industry, credited with working on 1,000 transactions with a total value of approximately $250 billion.

==Early life and education==
Wasserstein was born and raised in Midwood, Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lola (née Schleifer) and Morris Wasserstein. His father, a Jewish immigrant from pre-World War II Poland, settled in New York City and started a ribbon company. His maternal grandfather was Simon Schleifer, a Jewish teacher in the yeshiva in Wloclawek, Poland who later immigrated to Paterson, New Jersey and became a Hebrew school principal.

Wasserstein had four siblings: businesswoman Sandra Wasserstein Meyer (died in 1998); Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein (whose daughter, Lucy Jane, he was raising at the time of his death); Abner Wasserstein (died 2011); and Georgette Levis (died 2014), who was married to psychiatrist Albert J. Levis.

Wasserstein attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush for high school. He was a graduate of the McBurney School, University of Michigan, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Law School, and spent a year at the University of Cambridge.

==Career==
Starting his career as an attorney at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, Wasserstein then moved to First Boston Corp. in 1977 and eventually rose to co-head of that company&#x27;s then-dominant merger and acquisition practice. In 1988, with colleague Joseph Perella, he left First Boston to form investment bank boutique Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., which he sold in 2000, at the top of the late 1990s bull market, to Germany&#x27;s Dresdner Bank for around $1.4 billion in stock. In 2002, he left the unit Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (formed by merging Dresdner&#x27;s United Kingdom unit Kleinwort Benson with Wasserstein Perella) to become head of the financial services firm Lazard. In 2005, he led the initial public offering of Lazard and became the public firm&#x27;s first chairman and CEO.

Wasserstein controlled Wasserstein &amp; Co., a private equity firm with investments in a number of industries, particularly media. In 2004, he added &quot;New York Magazine&quot; to his media empire. In July 2007, he sold American Lawyer Media to Incisive Media for about $630 million in cash. He was credited with the term &quot;Pac-Man defense&quot;, which is used by targeted companies during a hostile takeover attempt.

==Philanthropy==
In 2007, Wasserstein made a $25 million donation to Harvard Law School, for the creation of a large academic wing of the school&#x27;s Northwest Corner complex, which was named Wasserstein Hall.

==Net worth==
According to Forbes, as of September 17, 2008, Wasserstein&#x27;s net worth was estimated to be $2.3 billion.

As of 2008, he owned an apartment at 927 Fifth Avenue in New York City, an estate in Santa Barbara in California, an Atlantic oceanfront estate in East Hampton (Long Island), a house at 38 Belgrave Square in London, and another apartment in Paris.

==Personal life==
Wasserstein was married four times and has seven biological children:
*Laura Lynelle Killin (married 1968, divorced 1974).
*Christine Parrott (divorced 1992). They had three children: Ben, Pam and Scoop. Christine is a psychoanalyst and has since remarried to American journalist and newspaper publisher Dan Rattiner.
*Claude Becker (married 1996, divorced 2008). They had two sons: Jack and Dash. Prior to her marriage to Wasserstein, Claude was an Emmy Award-winning CBS news producer. After Bruce&#x27;s death Claude took in Lucy, his sister Wendy&#x27;s daughter.
*Angela Chao (married 2009, up until Wasserstein&#x27;s death). She was the sister of Elaine Chao, who is married to U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell.

Wasserstein&#x27;s political position was liberal. He was involved with media since high school and college, when he was an editor on his high school newspaper, &quot;The McBurneian&quot; (McBurney School, New York), and later at the University of Michigan &quot;Michigan Daily&quot;, then served an internship at &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. Inspired by Ralph Nader, he was one of &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot; for a brief length of time. Rahm Emanuel and Vernon Jordan were employed by Wasserstein for a few years. Wasserstein also served as trustee for the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism from 2001 until his death.

==Death==
On October 11, 2009, Wasserstein was admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat. It was originally reported that his condition was serious, but that he was stable and recovering. However, Wasserstein died in Manhattan three days later, on October 14, at the age of 61.

<doc id="1303332" wikidata="Q819286" url="?curid=1303332" title="Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin">
<text>Count Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin (; 1650 – ) was a Russian statesman, diplomat, and military leader. During the reign of Peter the Great, Golovin served as his foreign minister from 1699–1706 and became the first chancellor of Russia. In addition to his political roles, he also held the positions of field marshal and general admiral, mostly holding the titles nominally and acting more in the capacity of a military administrator.

== Biography ==
Golovin came from a family of Russian treasurers of Byzantine Greek descent.

=== Diplomatic career ===

During the regency of Sophia Alekseyevna, Golovin was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Amur River region and entered into negotiations with the Qing dynasty over border disputes with the Tsardom of Russia. In August 1689, he served as the Tsardom&#x27;s representative in signing the Treaty of Nerchinsk with the Qing. Upon his return to Moscow, he was granted the title of boyar by Peter the Great, who had overthrown Sophia, his half-sister, in September 1689. 

In 1697, Golovin was appointed as one of three diplomats to head Peter&#x27;s Grand Embassy to Western Europe, along with Franz Lefort, the chief ambassador, and Prokopii Voznitsyn. When Lefort died in 1699, Golovin succeeded him as general admiral. During this time, he also became the first person to be decorated with the newly instituted Order of St. Andrew.

=== Foreign minister ===

Upon Lefort&#x27;s death in March 1699, Golovin succeeded him as &quot;de facto&quot; foreign minister until he was officially appointed as the head of the Ambassadorial Chancellery in February 1700. In October 1699, Golovin and Peter Shafirov participated in a secret meeting between Peter and Johann Patkul in which Russia allied themselves with Saxony, Denmark–Norway, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth against Sweden in the upcoming Great Northern War. At the start of the conflict, he was appointed as a field marshal by Peter.

In June 1700, he helped successfully negotiate the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople with the Ottoman Empire. The treaty extended Russian-Turkish peace for thirty years, and the Ottomans seceded the Azov region and additional territory in Kuban to the Tsardom. The treaty secured the Tsardom&#x27;s southern border with the Ottomans and allowed it to focus more of its resources towards the Great Northern War until Ottoman involvement in 1710. 

==Death==

Golovin died on , in Glukhov, on the road from Moscow to Kyiv. His remains were transported to the Simonov Monastery.

<doc id="1303334" wikidata="Q3544165" url="?curid=1303334" title="USS Tiru">
<text>USS &quot;Tiru&quot; (SS-416), a , was a vessel of the United States Navy named for the tiru, a member of the lizardfish family.

&quot;Tiru&quot;—laid down on 17 April 1944 at Vallejo, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard—remained uncompleted for three years as a result of the curtailment of the submarine building program at the end of World War II. In the fall of 1947, the Navy decided to complete &quot;Tiru&quot; as a &quot;GUPPY II&quot; (Greater Underwater Propulsive Power) snorkel boat. Her altered design incorporated improvements resulting from the Navy&#x27;s recent combat experience and German technical development.

&quot;Tiru&quot; was launched on 16 September 1947; sponsored by Mrs. John P. Cromwell, the widow of Captain John P. Cromwell, and commissioned on 1 September 1948. &quot;Tiru&quot; was once under the command of future FBI Director L. Patrick Gray of Watergate notoriety.

==Service history==
=== 1948–1959 ===

&quot;Tiru&quot; conducted training and trials off the West Coast before heading for Hawaii on 10 February 1949. Homeported at Pearl Harbor and attached to Submarine Squadron 12 (SubRon 12), the &quot;GUPPY&quot; submarine operated in Hawaiian waters for a year and one-half before conducting a 12-day snorkel voyage from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast which ended upon her arrival at San Diego on 27 June 1950.

On 9 June 1951, &quot;Tiru&quot; sailed for the Far East and her first Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment. While in Asiatic waters, she operated in support of United Nations forces engaged in the Korean War. Then, after departing Yokosuka, Japan, on 26 November, the warship arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 December. Her operations in the Hawaiian area continued until 24 February 1952, when &quot;Tiru&quot; got underway for her second WestPac deployment.

Between 1952 and 1959, &quot;Tiru&quot; conducted four more WestPac deployments, interspersed with local operations—providing services for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and conducting type-training. Operating with the 7th Fleet, her seventh WestPac tour lasted from 1 January to 17 April 1959.

=== 1959–1965 ===

&quot;Tiru&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for a major overhaul, entering the shipyard on 4 May 1959 for a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) conversion to a &quot;Guppy III&quot;. In the course of the work, the ship took on a new and different external appearance. Her hull was lengthened by ; she acquired a new conning tower, longer than its predecessor; and a fiberglass sail was added. Internally, increased sonar and ordnance equipment greatly enhanced the ship&#x27;s capabilities in those key areas. On the last day of the year 1959, &quot;Tiru&quot; emerged from the overhaul a virtually &quot;new&quot; ship.

From 1 January to 10 November 1960, &quot;Tiru&quot; conducted local operations out of Pearl Harbor to prove the worth of the FRAM/Guppy III conversion. After testing and honing her capabilities, the submarine departed Pearl Harbor on 10 November for another 7th Fleet deployment. She later returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 May 1961 upon completion of her eighth WestPac cruise.

Local operations out of her home port occupied the rest of 1961 and the first few months of 1962. She again was deployed to WestPac in March and April before returning to Hawaiian waters on 3 May. The next month, the ship operated with a carrier task force on ASW &quot;hunter-killer&quot; exercises. While the submarine was engaged in a firing exercise, a torpedo malfunction in her after torpedo room seriously damaged the compartment, and 18 men were overcome by toxic gases. Quick reaction averted a more serious tragedy and earned four crew members — one officer (Lieutenant Commander W. Earle Smith Jr.) and three enlisted men — the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.

=== 1966 ===

The ship conducted three more WestPac deployments through 1965 before she returned to a schedule of local operations. &quot;Tiru&quot; entered another major overhaul on 6 December 1965—one which saw the installation of a masking system to cover the ship&#x27;s own noise while snorkeling. Further internal alterations improved both her fighting capacity and her habitability. She conducted sea trials until 14 June 1966 when she departed Hawaii for the Naval Torpedo Station at Keyport, Washington, for an alignment and testing of her weapon system. The submarine departed the West Coast on 9 July, bound for Hawaiian waters, and made port at Pearl Harbor nine days later to commence pre-deployment operations.

After a 16-day passage from Hawaii, &quot;Tiru&quot; arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on 12 October. Three days later, she sailed to commence ASW exercises in the Coral Sea with warships of the Australian, British, New Zealand, and United States Navies. The nine-day exercise provided for submarine patrol, reconnaissance, and attack operations against both carrier and destroyer task forces before the submarine returned to Brisbane on 26 October.

On 2 November, &quot;Tiru&quot; got underway for Subic Bay, Philippine Islands. One day out, the submarine ran aground on Frederick Reef. For two anxious days and nights, &quot;Tiru&quot; attempted to extricate herself from the predicament by backing off under her own power, but to no avail. On 6 November, civilian tugboat &quot;Carlock&quot; and Australian destroyer came to the rescue, arriving on the scene and commencing salvage operations under the direction of a 7th Fleet salvage officer. Returning to Brisbane, &quot;Tiru&quot; was drydocked at South Brisbane Dockyard for emergency repairs and damage estimates.

Following temporary repairs to her sonar dome, outer hull, and keel, the submarine gingerly made her way from Australia to the United States Naval Ship Repair Facility, Yokosuka, Japan. En route, &quot;Tiru&quot; called at Guam to provision alongside and pick up new crew members. Arriving at Yokosuka on 29 November, the submarine entered drydock for restricted availability.

=== 1967–1970 ===

Once repaired, &quot;Tiru&quot; left Yokosuka on 9 January 1967 for Chin Hae, South Korea, and while in transit provided services for an Iwakuni-based patrol plane squadron. Operating with Republic of Korea (ROK) ASW forces from 15 January to 17 January, &quot;Tiru&quot; arrived back at Yokosuka on 22 January for upkeep. From 7 February to 20 March, the submarine conducted special operations before returning for further upkeep prior to a &quot;Yankee Station&quot; deployment off Vietnam. She later operated with Nationalist Chinese forces on ASW exercises; conducted additional special operations; and again provided services for patrol plane squadrons based at Iwakuni, before returning to Hawaii on 15 May.

Spending the remainder of the year 1967 on local operations out of Pearl Harbor, &quot;Tiru&quot; commenced the year 1968 as a unit of Submarine Division 72 (SubDiv 72), SubRon 7, and Submarine Flotilla 5 (SubFlot 5). On 16 May, the submarine was shifted to operational control of Commander, 7th Fleet, with her home port changed to Yokosuka, Japan. Departing the western Pacific on 4 October after a tour which had included a transit through the Vietnam War zone, &quot;Tiru&quot; returned to the West Coast; and her home port was changed to San Francisco, California, while she became a unit of SubDiv 52, SubRon 5, SubFlot 1.

Overhauls and local operations occupied the ship until 12 November 1969, when &quot;Tiru&quot; sailed west for another WestPac deployment. Transferred to the command of the Commander, 7th Fleet, on 6 December, the submarine arrived at Yokosuka on 10 December. Five days later, she got underway for special operations which took her into 1970.

&quot;Tiru&quot; participated in Exercise &quot;Sea Rover,&quot; with United States and Australian naval units, before heading home for the United States at the conclusion of her WestPac deployment. While approaching Guam for voyage repairs, she routinely copied the evening weather broadcast which was accompanied by an urgent alert notifying the ship of a search and rescue (SAR) operation underway to look for and rescue survivors of a small craft which had been adrift for two days in a heavy sea. An extensive search by Guam-based SAR forces had thus far turned up nothing, but &quot;Tiru&quot; located the five people—two of them Japanese nationals—and rescued them, despite darkness and high seas. Soon after &quot;Tiru&quot;″s arrival at Guam on 14 April 1970, the Japanese consul visited the submarine to express his government&#x27;s appreciation for the ship&#x27;s rescue mission.

=== 1970–1975 ===

Subsequently arriving at San Diego on 8 May after a brief period at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Tiru&quot; conducted local operations, transited to San Francisco to undergo an overhaul at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard and returned to San Diego prior to being transferred to the Atlantic Fleet on 1 August 1970. Underway on 6 August for Charleston, South Carolina, her new home port, &quot;Tiru&quot; called at Acapulco, Mexico; Rodman, Canal Zone; transited the Panama Canal; and visited Kingston, Jamaica, before reaching Charleston harbor on 2 September. For the remainder of the year, the ship conducted local operations, provided services, and underwent type training—activities which continued into 1972. Later transferred to SubFlot 6, SubRon 4, SubDiv 41, during 1972, &quot;Tiru&quot; operated in the Caribbean Sea and off the lower East Coast of the United States, with two deployments to European waters, into 1975.

On 1 July 1975, &quot;Tiru&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list to be sold to the Turkish government. An American arms embargo imposed on Turkey as a result of the Cyprus tensions between Greece and Turkey delayed the sale, however, even though negotiations and arrangements had been well into the planning stages. The sale was never completed, and on 19 July 1979 &quot;Tiru&quot; was sunk as a target by the submarine at , about off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

&quot;Tiru&quot; was the last submarine of the &quot;Balao&quot; class to be commissioned, and was also the last to be decommissioned. &quot;Tiru&quot; was also the last submarine of a World War II vintage design to be decommissioned by the U.S. Navy.

==Trivia==
At the time of her decommissioning, &quot;Tiru&quot; was the oldest submarine in service with the US Navy. She held this distinction for only four days following the decommissioning of &quot;USS Tigrone&quot; (SS-419) on 27 June 1975. She was also the last unit of the &quot;Balao&quot; class to be decommissioned.

<doc id="1303348" wikidata="Q6847571" url="?curid=1303348" title="Mike Kruczek">
<text>Michael Francis Kruczek (born March 15, 1953) is an American football coach and former quarterback. He is currently the offensive coordinator, under his son Garrett Kruczek, the head football coach for Lake Brantley High School of Florida.

==Playing career==
Kruczek earned All-America in 1975 as a quarterback at Boston College where he set several B.C. passing and total offense records.

* 1974: 104/151 for 1,275 yards with 6 TD vs 7 INT
* 1975: 107/164 for 1,132 yards with 6 TD vs 7 INT

He was selected in the second round of the 1976 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers and played in 29 games for them from 1976 to 1979 and was a member of Super Bowl championship squads in 1978 and 1979.

Kruczek distinguished himself in the NFL by winning six consecutive starts as a rookie in 1976 when he stepped into the Steelers starting lineup for an injured Terry Bradshaw; buoyed by the historic rushing duo of Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier (who became only the second pair of teammates to each run for 1,000 yards in the same season), and a fierce defense which recorded three shutouts and allowed only 25 points (4.2 ppg) during his six starts, Kruczek helped lead the Steelers to the AFC title game. During the victory streak Kruczek did not throw a touchdown pass, however for the season he completed passes at an impressive 60% rate along with an excellent average of 8.9 yards/attempt, and a solid 74.5 passer rating (compared to the league average rating of 67.0). He unexpectedly ended up as Bradshaw&#x27;s primary backup as a rookie following the team waiving both of their backup quarterbacks from the previous four years (Terry Hanratty and Joe Gilliam), and the Steelers opting not to sign a third quarterback; Kruczek would have likely been the third-stringer behind Gilliam if not for his drug addiction.

Kruczek&#x27;s record for consecutive wins as a rookie stood until 1985 when it was broken by Los Angeles Rams quarterback Dieter Brock who, at age 34, won seven consecutive starts to begin his first NFL season. Brock was an unusual rookie, having spent his prior 11 years (1974–1984) playing professionally in the Canadian Football League before joining the Rams.

Taking the more conventional route (college to the NFL), in 2004 a Pittsburgh quarterback again claimed the consecutive rookie wins record when 22-year-old Steelers rookie Ben Roethlisberger won 13 games to begin his career.

Kruczek concluded his NFL career in 1980 with the Washington Redskins. During his career Kruczek never threw a touchdown pass in a regular season game and currently holds the league record for career pass attempts, 154, without a touchdown.

==Coaching career==
Kruczek began his coaching career as the quarterbacks coach for Bobby Bowden at Florida State from 1982 to 1983. He served one season in the same capacity for the Jacksonville Bulls of the USFL before he became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Central Florida. He was named UCF&#x27;s head coach in 1998 when 13-year coach Gene McDowell was forced to resign due to a cellular phone fraud scandal. Kruczek&#x27;s run as coach benefited from the fact that he inherited future NFL Pro Bowl quarterback Daunte Culpepper as a recruit from the McDowell era.

Kruczek led the fledgling Division I-A program to some of its biggest successes. In his first season, he led the Knights to a 9–2 record and had a verbal commitment to playing in the first Oahu Bowl. However, those plans were dashed when Miami upset undefeated UCLA, and the resulting domino effect left the Knights out of what would have been their first bowl game ever. Another highlight was an upset win over the 3–8 University of Alabama Crimson Tide in 2000, which gave UCF its first victory over a program from a Bowl Championship Series automatic qualifying conference.

Kruczek&#x27;s UCF Knights squad joined the Mid-American Conference as a football-only member starting in the 2002 season, with many pundits expecting the team to win the MAC&#x27;s Eastern Division championship. After a successful debut season in 2002 in which Kruczek&#x27;s team finished 7–5 and earned second place in the MAC East, UCF struggled mightily in 2003, going 3–9. Starting quarterback Ryan Schneider was dismissed from the team for academic violations and UCF had a 3–7 record before Kruczek was dismissed with two games remaining in the season. After a loss to MAC bottom dweller Eastern Michigan, Kruczek was fired despite having signed a three-year contract extension at the start of the season. Kruczek was replaced by George O&#x27;Leary for the 2004 season.

==Personal life==
Kruczek and his wife, Leigh, have two children: a daughter, Kelly, and a son, Garrett.

<text>Hermann Olshausen (21 August 1796 – 4 September 1839) was a German theologian.

==Biography==
Olshausen was born at Oldeslohe in Holstein. He was educated at the universities of Kiel (1814) and Berlin (1816), where he was influenced by Schleiermacher and Neander. In 1817 he was awarded the prize at the Festival of the Reformation for an essay, &quot;Melanchthons Charakteristik aus seinen Briefen dargestellt&quot; (1818). This essay brought him to the notice of the Prussian Minister of Public Worship, and in 1820 he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Berlin. In 1821, he became professor extraordinarius at the University of Königsberg, and in 1827 professor. In 1834, he became professor at the University of Erlangen.

Olshausen&#x27;s expertise lay in New Testament exegesis; his &quot;Kommentar über sämmtliche Schriften des Neuen Testaments&quot; (Commentary on the complete text of the New Testament; completed and revised by Ebrard and Wiesinger) began to appear at Königsberg in 1830, and was translated into English in 4 volumes (Edinburgh, 1847–1849). He had prepared for it by his other works, &quot;Die Echtheit der vier kanonischen Evangelien, aus der Geschichte der zwei ersten Jahrhunderte erwiesen&quot; (The veracity of the four canonical Gospels demonstrated from the history of the first two centuries, 1823), &quot;Ein Wort über tieferen Schriftsinn&quot; (1824) and &quot;Die biblische Schriftauslegung&quot; (1825). In the latter two works, he presents his method of exegesis, and rejects the doctrine of verbal inspiration.

==Family==
He was a brother of politician Theodor Olshausen and orientalist Justus Olshausen.

<doc id="1303351" wikidata="Q284617" url="?curid=1303351" title="Cleveland Bay">
<text>The Cleveland Bay is a breed of horse that originated in England during the 17th century, named after its colouring and the Cleveland district of Yorkshire. It is a well-muscled horse, with legs that are strong but short in relation to the body. The horses are always bay in colour, although a few light hairs in the mane and tail are characteristic of some breed lines. It is the oldest established horse breed in England. The ancestors of the breed were developed during the Middle Ages for use as pack horses, when they gained their nickname of &quot;Chapman Horses&quot;. These pack horses were cross-bred with Andalusian and Barb blood, and later with Arabians and Thoroughbreds, to create the Cleveland Bay of today. Over the years, the breed became lighter in frame as they were employed more as carriage and riding horses. The popularity of the Cleveland Bay has greatly fluctuated since it was first imported to the United States in the early nineteenth century. Despite serious declines in the population after the Second World War, the breed has experienced a resurgence in popularity since the 1970s, although only around 550 horses existed worldwide as of 2006.

They have been patronized by members of the British Royal Family throughout their history, and they are still used to pull carriages in royal processions today. The breed has also been used to develop and improve several warmblood and draught horse breeds. Today they are used for farm work and driving, as well as under-saddle work. They are particularly popular for fox hunting and show jumping, both pure blooded and when crossed with Thoroughbreds. The Cleveland Bay is a rare breed, and both the United Kingdom–based Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the United States–based Livestock Conservancy consider the population to be at critical limits for extinction.

==Characteristics==
The Cleveland Bay generally stands between , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays with a more reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses are expected to have complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registration. 

The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.

The breed has a large head, slightly convex profile, and a long, well-muscled neck. The withers are well muscled, which often makes them less pronounced, the chest is broad and deep, the shoulders are muscular and sloping, and the croup slightly sloping. The legs are short in relation to the body, but strong and well muscled. The legs have little or no feather, as the breed was developed partially for working in the heavy clay soils of its native country, where heavy feather led to increased disease prevalence. They are hardy and long-lived horses, and docile in temperament. In the early twentieth century, when a breed standard was issued by the British Cleveland Bay Society for use in judging shows, a section was added on the movement of the horses, describing the desired action, especially at the trot. This was included in part because military potential was still considered a factor in evaluating harness horses and a good trot was necessary for an artillery horse. It was also evaluated because breeds with large action at the trot often also have a potential for jumping. The combination of desired characteristics means that the breed is useful for breeding show jumpers, eventers and steeplechasers (the latter especially when crossed with Thoroughbreds).

Part-bred horses can be registered under certain conditions. A horse with at least one grandparent may be registered in the UK stud-book. The Australasian society refers to part-breds as Sporthorses; they require at least 25% Cleveland Bay blood.

== Uses ==

The Cleveland Bay is a versatile horse and is still used today for many tasks, including driving and farmwork. The horses are used as heavy hunters, as they are powerful and able to carry a man weighing for a full day of hunting over large obstacles and through heavy clay. When crossed with Thoroughbreds, the resulting progeny are lighter and faster, but still strong and heavy of bone. When show jumping was first beginning as a sport during the mid-nineteenth century, Cleveland Bays were among the initial stars. Two mares, Star and Fanny Drape, were two of the top performers. Fanny Drape was known to have cleared a stone wall with a rider on her back, and a bar while being jumped in-hand. In 2006, a Cleveland Bay stallion named Tregoyd Journeyman was used as a model for a new horse figure by Breyer Animal Creations, and the stallion participated in that year&#x27;s Breyer model horse festival.

== British royal horses ==

In the 1920s, Cleveland Bays replaced black Hanoverian horses in the British royal stables. Of the two types of carriage horses at the Royal Mews, the Windsor Greys pull carriages of senior royal family members, and the Cleveland Bays pull dignitaries and do other work. Post is driven daily between Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace with two Bays pulling a Clarence Brougham. Purebred and crossbred Cleveland Bays make up the majority of the bay horses in the Royal Mews, the British royal stables, where they receive intense training to desensitize them before they are put to work drawing royal carriages. The King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery predominantly use bay-colored horses of several breeds; those pulling the limbers and caissons are frequently Cleveland Bays. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, used the breed during the 1970s and 1980s in combined driving competitions, borrowing horses from the Royal Mews and returning them for state duties.

==History==

Developed in the Cleveland area of Yorkshire, England, the Cleveland Bay is said to be the oldest of the established English horse breeds, and the only horse native to Britain that does not belong to the heavy horse group. The closest breed in type is the Irish Draught, which shares common ancestors with the Cleveland Bay.

===Development===

The earliest breeding of the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done in large part by English churches and monasteries, to meet a need for pack horses to carry trade goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England. These medieval horses gained the nickname of &quot;Chapman Horses&quot; because of their use by itinerant dealers known as &quot;chapmen&quot;. What is now the Cleveland Bay is thought to have been developed from Barb, Iberian, and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares. The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe, bought off the docks in Marseilles, France, and transported back to England. 

The Andalusian or Iberian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Córdoba, Spain, and gifted to English royals, such as King Henry VIII of England, by the King of Spain. The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses, and the first infusion of Iberian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses. The Iberian horses also made their way to the outlying estates of English nobility, and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s men after the English Civil War. Once in the hands of Cromwell&#x27;s men, many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses, adding a second infusion of Iberian bloodlines. In the late 17th century, a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier, or from the Moors themselves.

Between 1685 and 1785, it is believed that this early Chapman Horse/Andalusian/Barb type served as the foundation stock for the Cleveland Bay. During this century the type grew bigger due to better feeding, and by 1785, had developed through selective breeding into the &quot;agricultural type&quot; Cleveland Bay. This original type was heavier and more draught-like than the breed of today. This was due to a need for strength more than speed on the farms and poor roads of 17th- and 18th-century England. As roads improved, and speed became more important in the late 18th century, Thoroughbred and Arabian blood may have been added. The resulting horses were used extensively as coach horses, and were lighter of frame, with a well-arched neck and powerful shoulders, making for a flashy carriage horse. 

Thoroughbred blood is believed to have been added by some scholars, in spite the claims of breeders that the Cleveland Bay was &quot;free from taint of black or blood&quot;, meaning either Thoroughbred &quot;blood&quot; or the Old English &quot;Black&quot; and its descendants. The addition of Thoroughbred breeding is thought responsible for Cleveland Bays born with red legs (as opposed to the black normally associated with bay horses), generally the result of a chestnut Thoroughbred sire in the family tree.

A 2019 genetic study of the Cleveland Bay breed also revealed genetic similarities to the now-extinct Turkoman horse, the Connemara Pony, and the Irish Draught. A separate 2020 study also found that three of the maternal lines in the modern-day Cleveland Bay likely originated from Iberian or Barb mares.

===Establishment===
The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society was formed in 1883, and the first stud book was published in 1884. The 19th century saw the export of many Cleveland Bays overseas to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, India, Russia, France, Germany, and the European continent. In the early 19th century, Cleveland Bays were first imported to Maryland, Virginia, and Massachusetts in the United States, and in 1884 the Upperville Colt &amp; Horse Show was created in Virginia by Colonel Richard Henry Dulany to showcase his imported Cleveland Bay stallion and the offspring of the stallion. The Cleveland Bay Society of America was formed in 1885, and by 1907 over 2,000 horses were registered in the studbook. The stud book began publication in 1889, although horses were registered who had lived as far back as 1860. Judging from the descriptions of the earliest registered horses, it is possible that many of the &quot;Cleveland Bays&quot; registered were actually Yorkshire Coach Horses; however, all were registered as Clevelands, and that is what they are known as today. Over 2,000 horses were registered with the association by 1907. The horses were of interest to Buffalo Bill Cody, who drove four Cleveland Bay stallions in his Wild West Show.

Before the First World War, having seen the horse cavalry feats of mounted Boers during the Second Boer War, Britain increased its cavalry reserves. Smaller Cleveland Bays were used to carry British troopers, and larger ones pulled artillery; the War Office offered premiums on Cleveland Bay stallions. Although the First World War was not the cavalry war that had been expected, large numbers of horses were used to pull artillery and losses were high. Because the war caused a depletion in stock, in 1920 and 1921, the British society opened a special register for previously unregistered mares of Cleveland Bay type, including some already registered as Yorkshire Coach Horses, subject to inspection. Foals of these mares were eligible for registration in the main stud-book, and were also eligible to compete in breed competitions. Some were bred and owned by King George V.

===Decline and re-emergence===

However, interest in the Cleveland Bay was waning, due to increased mechanisation, and the Great Depression of the early 1930s reduced exports by almost a third. There was a brief revival of interest in the late 1930s in the United States when Alexander Mackay-Smith imported some as foundation stock for hunters. The decline continued, quickening after the Second World War; in 1960, the War Office stopped offering premiums on stallions, and many breeders discontinued breeding.

By 1962, only four purebred stallions were present in the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II saved the breed by purchasing Mulgrave Supreme, a stallion that was about to be sold to a buyer in the United States. The stallion was bred to pure- and part-bred mares, and within 15 years, there were 36 purebred stallions in the UK. Elizabeth II was a patron of the Society from 1977, and during the Society&#x27;s centenary year of 1984 she acted as its president.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, interest in the breed increased, and part-bred Cleveland Bays were in demand for use as riding horses, especially for use as hunters and jumpers. In 1964, a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross competed in show jumping in the Tokyo Olympics. Another half-bred Cleveland Bay competed for the British Olympic team in show jumping at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, while a third was a reserve mount for the Canadian show jumping team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In the late 1960s and &#x27;70s, horses continued to be exported to many countries. Japan, the United States, and Australia have continued to import the horses from England; and, in New Zealand, crosses between Cleveland Bay stallions and native mares were in demand on cattle and sheep stations.

The Cleveland Bay Horse Society keeps a separate register for part-bred horses. In the late 20th century, the breed again gained the attention of the United States public, and in 1985, the U.S. association was reactivated, renamed &quot;The Cleveland Bay Society of North America&quot;. In the US, The Livestock Conservancy considers their status to be critical, which means there is an estimated global population of less than 500, and fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust also considers their status to be critical, with less than 300 breeding females registered worldwide. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the breed population to be at critical levels, meaning there are between 100 and 300 breeding females left in the world. About 135 purebred horses are registered in the United States and Canada. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550 Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were mares; the 2005 foal crop produced fewer than 50 horses. Paul Bennett, the director of the Coach and Livestock Department for Colonial Williamsburg, estimated the global population of purebred Cleveland Bays to be around 1,000 in 2020, with 220 being in North America, including the United States and Canada. However, infertility in mares was an ongoing issue.

A 2020 study revealed inbreeding to be another issue in the Cleveland Bay breed, with genetic analysis revealing that approximately 91% of the stallion and 48% of the dam lines no longer existed in the modern breed, partly due to loss of genetic diversity through crossbreeding from 1900 to 2006. The study also found that &quot;only 3 ancestors determine 50% of the genome in the living population, with 70% of maternal lineage being derived from 3 founder females, and all paternal lineages traced back to a single founder stallion&quot;.

According to the Cleveland Bay Horse Society of North America (CBHSNA), in 2023, there were only 27 purebred foals born in North America, but this represented an 145% increase from previous breeding seasons from 2013 to 2022. According to the group, there were 758 horses of Cleveland Bay ancestry alive in North America as of June 2024, with 238 (32.4%) being purebreds, and 520 (68.6%) being partbreds. Pennsylvania and Michigan in the United States and Canada were noted as Cleveland Bay breeding hubs.

== Influence on other breeds ==

In the late 18th century, the Cleveland Bay was used to create the Yorkshire Coach Horse by crossing with Thoroughbreds. The Cleveland Bay was used in the creation of the Oldenburg breed in Germany, because of its stamina, strength, and jumping ability. The breed was also used to create and improve the Holstein and Hanoverian breeds, as well as other German warmbloods, and the Selle Français in France. In the 19th century, the Cleveland Bay was also crossed with the Clydesdale, Percheron, and Suffolk Punch breeds to create the foundation stock for the Vladimir Heavy Draft, a new draught breed developed by Russia to fill that country&#x27;s need for a heavy draught breed. The Vladimir Heavy Draft was officially recognized as its own breed in 1946.
===Yorkshire Coach Horse===
The Yorkshire Coach Horse is an extinct horse breed or type that was created by crossing the stronger and stockier Cleveland Bay with Thoroughbreds to make a faster carriage horse when the quality of roads improved in England. 

The horse closely resembled the Cleveland Bay, though was taller, with finer head and bone, and colored bay or brown. In 1905, J. Wortley Axe wrote, &quot;In most of their essential properties, however, the Cleveland Bay and the Yorkshire Coach-horse are very closely allied, the two varieties representing the best type of heavy coachers we possess&quot;. Called by some the &quot;New Cleveland Bay&quot;, foreigners often could not distinguish between the two breeds, and many horses registered as Cleveland Bays in European coach horse studbooks were actually Yorkshire Coach Horses. 

There has been some debate over whether or not the Yorkshire Coach Horse constituted an actual breed or was just a type as its epoch was relatively short-lived, breeders primarily used first and second-generation Thoroughbred and Cleveland Bay crosses, and many found the Yorkshire Coach Horse to be indistinguishable from the Cleveland Bay. In North America, Yorkshire Coach Horses were registered under the Cleveland Bay stud book and usually called Cleveland Bays. In 1886 England, a Yorkshire Coach Horse Stud Book was started, which contained horses that were three-quarters Cleveland Bay and one-quarter Thoroughbred. The stud book was closed in 1936 as extinct. 

According to Chris Berry of &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;, &quot;The late 18th century was the golden age of carriage driving. Yorkshire coach horses were exported all over the world to provide matched pairs and teams. During the height of the London season hundreds of pairs of Yorkshire coach horses could be seen in Hyde Park every afternoon.&quot;

<text>Viau station () is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 

The station opened on June 6, 1976, as part of the extension of the Green Line to Honoré-Beaugrand station, in time for the 1976 Summer Olympics.

== Overview ==
Designed by architect Irving Sager, it is a normal side platform station built in a shallow open cut. The eastern end of the station is surmounted by the large station pavilion, which includes the ticket hall. There is no transept; stairs lead directly from the platforms to street level.

The eastern wall of the mezzanine is decorated by a non-figurative ceramic mural by Jean-Paul Mousseau, entitled &quot;Opus 74&quot; and representing the Olympic flame and the tower of the Olympic Stadium.

=== Accessibility ===
In 2019, work to modernise the station, as well as expand the nearby underground workshop began. In November 2021, the station became the 19th accessible station in Montréal with the installation of elevators. Remaining work was completed in January 2022.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue Viau, named for local industrialist Charles-Théodore Viau, who purchased nearby tracts of land and developed them as a neighbourhood later named Viauville.

<doc id="1303356" wikidata="Q7994959" url="?curid=1303356" title="White-label ABMs">
<text>White-label automatic banking machines (ABMs) or white-label ATMs are ATMs that offer an alternative to traditional bank-owned ATMs for cash dispensing. These machines may be operated by an independent ATM deployer.

White-label, or &quot;no name,&quot; ATMs are commonly found in non-traditional locations, such as grocery stores or other non-bank venues. These machines do not display any major bank branding, and the fees are generally higher compared to those of bank-owned ATMs.

==History==
In Canada, the major financial institutions have their own branded ABMs located across the country, with these machines prominently displaying the banks&#x27; logos. White-label or &quot;no name&quot; ABMs, typically found in non-traditional locations, do not display any major bank labels. Before 1997, only banks and other deposit-taking financial institutions were permitted to participate in the Interac network. After 1997, independent operators were allowed to operate ABMs not owned by major financial institutions.

, with a network of over 15,000 units, the NRT Technology Corporation became the largest processor of non-bank ABMs in Canada, processing more than 50 million transactions annually.

In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permitted non-bank entities to establish, own, and operate ATMs in June 2012. The central bank issued Certificates of Authorisation to eight non-bank entities for setting up and operating WLAs. As of March 2023, over 35,800 White Label ATMs had been deployed in India.

==Fees==
Customers typically incur an additional fee when using white-label ABMs, which can be divided between the private provider and the property owner hosting the machine.

According to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), fees for using a white-label ATM can exceed $6.00 per transaction. The agency notes that private operators are not subject to minimum or maximum fee limits, allowing the operator to set the amount. However, operators are required to disclose the fee and provide consumers with the option to cancel the transaction.

CIBC faced criticism for creating a wholly owned subsidiary, Ready Cash, as a white-label company. Many CIBC customers, who typically enjoy free transactions with official CIBC accounts, are charged twice when using Ready Cash—once by Ready Cash and again by CIBC, as it is not classified as a bank.

White-label ATMs are commonly found in local establishments like gas stations, bars, pubs, and restaurants, where retailers receive a fee for each transaction. Most white-label ATMs charge a minimum of C$1.50 per use, with a portion of that fee going to the retailer based on their involvement with the ATM. This fee is in addition to any charges imposed by the cardholder&#x27;s financial institution.

In India, WLAs allow ATM card holders five free transactions per month. The WLA operator is compensated through an interchange fee paid by the card-issuing bank. 

Recently RBI established a committee to review fee structure for white-label ATMs.

===Notification of fees===
A warning message will appear before the cardholder confirms the withdrawal, informing them of the service cost. There is always an option to cancel the transaction to avoid incurring the fees.

<text>Lili Chookasian (August 1, 1921April 9, 2012) was an American contralto of Armenian ethnicity, who appeared with many of the world&#x27;s major symphony orchestras and opera houses. She began her career in the 1940s as a concert singer but did not draw wider acclaim until she began singing opera in her late thirties. She arose as one of the world&#x27;s leading contraltos during the 1960s and 1970s, and notably had a long and celebrated career at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1962 through 1986. She was admired for her sonorous, focused tone as well as her excellent musicianship. She often chose, against tradition, to sing oratorios from memory.

==Early life and concert career: 1921–1958==
Chookasian was born in Chicago, the youngest of three children to immigrants from Armenia. Her family had immigrated to the United States shortly after the Armenian genocide of 1915 which claimed the lives of two of Chookasian&#x27;s grandparents and several members of her extended family. Chookasian&#x27;s first language was Armenian, as her parents spoke that language in the home. She only became proficient speaking English through attending school as a child.

Chookasian first became involved with music through singing at local churches and in musical programs at her high school, notably appearing as Buttercup in her school&#x27;s production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. After high school she began studying singing seriously with Philip Manuel and Gavin Williamson, both with whom she took lessons for almost twenty years. In her late teens she started earning money singing for churches and on the radio. In 1941, at the age of twenty, she married George Gavejian who was a friend of her older brother. They had a very happy marriage that lasted for forty-six years, ending when Gavejian died in 1987. They had several children and eleven grandchildren together.

Chookasian began performing professionally as an oratorio and concert singer in the 1940s, mostly in Chicago but also occasionally out of town. The biggest triumph of her early concert career was in January 1955 when she was chosen by Bruno Walter as the contralto soloist for Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, &quot;Resurrection&quot; with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. During this time she was also on the voice faculty at Northwestern University.

In 1956 Chookasian was diagnosed with breast cancer and her physicians gave her six months to live. With the support of her loved ones she decided to fight the cancer. She underwent a radical mastectomy, which was further complicated by a widespread infection that required three additional surgeries. With continuous medical attention and the support of her family she prevailed and her life slowly returned to normal.

==An opera career begins: 1959–1961==
It wasn&#x27;t until 1959, at the age of 38, that Chookasian made her first opera appearance, making her debut as Adalgisa in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; with the Arkansas State Opera (ASO). Edward McGuire, founder and stage director of the ASO, offered her the part after soprano Barbara Stevenson, who sang Norma, recommended her. Stevenson gave McGuire a recording of a &quot;Messiah&quot; that she had sung with Chookasian in Salt Lake City and, after hearing the recording, McGuire knew he wanted Chookasian to sing the part.

Chookasian&#x27;s debut performance was a resounding success and a recording of that performance was given to conductor Thomas Schippers by McGuire at the Festival of Two Worlds the following summer. McGuire recalls, &quot;He was astonished by Lili&#x27;s voice, but he had nothing in mind for her at the time.&quot; However, two years later Schippers wanted &quot;that extraordinary Adalgisa from Arkansas&quot; for a concert performance of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; with the New York Philharmonic. However, he could not remember her name and was unable to track her down until a chance meeting with Sheldon Soffer tipped him off that she was working with the Baltimore Opera Company under Rosa Ponselle. Chookasian had spent the last year studying under Ponselle and had created her second opera role on stage with the company, Azucena in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in 1960. Schippers contacted Chookasian to come up for an audition, and after hearing her, she was immediately engaged to sing the music of Amelfa Timoferevna (in &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;) for her New York Philharmonic debut in early 1961.

Shortly after her NYP debut, Chookasian was offered a contract with the Metropolitan Opera by Rudolf Bing but turned it down because she was afraid it would take too much time away from her family. In the summer of 1961 she repeated the music of Amelfa Timoferevna for European debut at the Festival dei Due Mondi, again under the baton of Schippers. She also made her European opera debut at the festival under Schippers as Herodias in &quot;Salome&quot;. She sang Herodias again just a month later at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi and also gave a lauded performance of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;, accompanied by Charles Wadsworth at the Teatro Caio Melisso that summer. The following November she headed back to Baltimore to sing her first Amneris in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;.

In the midst of Chookasian&#x27;s breakout 1961 season she discovered another lump in her other breast. She told no one, fulfilled her commitments in New York, Baltimore, and Europe, and then finally sought a doctor&#x27;s care in November 1961 after finishing up performance of &quot;Aida&quot;. She went through another mastectomy, after which her prognosis was good; the cancer had not spread, and she recovered quickly.

==Metropolitan Opera years: 1962–1986==
After returning to the United States, Chookasian was approached by Rudolf Bing again to join the roster at the Metropolitan Opera. This time she relented and made her debut with the company on March 9, 1962 as La Cieca in Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot; with Zinka Milanov in the title role, Franco Corelli as Enzo, Nell Rankin as Laura, Robert Merrill as Barnaba, Giorgio Tozzi as Alvise, and Fausto Cleva conducting. During the performance Francis Robinson, then assistant general manager at the Met, had the house phones hooked up so Rosa Ponselle could hear Chookasian&#x27;s entrance over the telephone at her home. Ponselle, who had developed a strong personal friendship with Chookasian as well as being her opera mentor, recalled &quot;It not only brought back such wonderful memories, but it was another Force of Destiny.&quot; The audience and the critics responded enthusiastically to her performance. Paul Henry Lang wrote in his review that &quot;From what we heard last night, we may predict a splendid career for the young lady from Chicago.&quot; This was the beginning of a more than two decade long career at the Met, during which time Chookasian was coached privately with Armen Boyajian.

During her 24-year-long career with the company, Chookasian sang many principal contralto roles and a number of secondary parts. Her roles included Adalgisa, Amneris in &quot;Aida&quot;, Auntie in &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, Azucena, Death in &quot;Le Rossignol&quot;, Erda in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot;, Filippyevna in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, the First Norn in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, Frugola in &quot;Il tabarro&quot;, Geneviève in &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, Gertrud in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, the Grandmother in &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, Leocadia Begbick in &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;, Madelon in &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, Mamma Lucia in &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;, Marthe in &quot;Faust&quot;, Mary in &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, Mistress Quickly in &quot;Falstaff&quot;, the Nurse in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, the Princess in &quot;Suor Angelica&quot;, Teresa in &quot;La Sonnambula&quot;, Ulrica in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, the Witch in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, and Zita in &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; among others. She also notably sang the role of Maharanee in the United States premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Last Savage&quot; in a cast that included George London, Nicolai Gedda, Roberta Peters and Teresa Stratas.

During her career at the Met, Chookasian sang with many great singers like Carlo Bergonzi, Richard Cassilly, Franco Corelli, Phyllis Curtin, Mattiwilda Dobbs, William Dooley, Plácido Domingo, Reri Grist, Anna Moffo, Birgit Nilsson, Leontyne Price, Gail Robinson, Leonie Rysanek, Joan Sutherland, Renata Tebaldi, and Richard Tucker among others. In 1984, during a performance of &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;, she suffered a minor heart attack on stage and was unable to continue the performance. After this her performance career slowed down somewhat and her last performance at the Met was on February 17, 1986 as Gertrude in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; with Neil Shicoff as Roméo and Catherine Malfitano as Juliette. Her 290th performance with the company, was also her farewell to the opera stage.

While the Met was her major home, Chookasian also remained active as a concert performer and sang in opera houses both in the United States and Europe. She quickly became one of the leading contraltos performing on the international stage during the 1960s and 1970s, singing under Georg Solti, Leonard Bernstein, James Levine, Zubin Mehta, Seiji Ozawa, Fritz Reiner, Karl Böhm, Herbert von Karajan, Lorin Maazel, and many other great conductors, with such ensembles as the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Vienna Philharmonic among others. She was particularly admired worldwide for her performances in Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9, Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; and above all Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;. Of the latter work Chookasian stated, &quot;Every note of the Requiem seemed written for my throat&quot;. Under Eugene Ormandy she recorded &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; for Columbia Masterworks, and she opened the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in August 1966, again with Ormandy. With Leonard Bernstein, she was one of the many soloists in his recording of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8. Among her many other recordings are Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 with the New York Philharmonic under Bernstein, the First Norn in &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan, and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Erich Leinsdorf.

On the opera stage Chookasian returned to the Spoleto Festival in 1962 to sing Clarissa in Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;. In 1963 she made her first of several appearances at the New York City Opera in the title role of Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Medium&quot;. She made her first appearance at the Bayreuth festival in 1965 singing in three of her Wagner roles: Mary, the First Norn, and Erda. In 1966 she made her first appearances with the Opéra de Montréal and the American Opera Society. In 1970 she made her debut with the San Francisco Opera as Mistress Quickly. In 1973 she sang Amneris at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and sang Erda in &quot;Siegfried&quot; for her debut with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. In 1976 she notably sang in the world premiere of Thomas Pasatieri&#x27;s &quot;Inés de Castro&quot; and sang Ulrica with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company. She also appeared with the Zurich Opera, the Salzburg Festival, the New Orleans Opera, the Houston Grand Opera, and other companies in the United States and Europe. Chookasian would often bring her husband with her when she traveled as his work in real estate was flexible enough for him to travel. Chookasian fondly recounted one of her most memorable trips to Yerevan, Armenia in a 1997 &quot;Opera News&quot; interview. Chookasian was invited to the city to perform in two productions mounted in her honor: Amneris in &quot;Aida&quot; and the Armenian composer Tigran Chukhajian&#x27;s opera &quot;Arshak II&quot;.

After retiring from the stage in 1986, Chookasian joined the voice faculty at Yale University&#x27;s School of Music. She taught at Yale and resided in Branford, Connecticut. In 2002 she was awarded Yale&#x27;s Sanford Medal.

She died at her home in Branford at the age of 90 in 2012.

<doc id="1303372" wikidata="Q4854988" url="?curid=1303372" title="Bang the Drum Slowly">
<text>Bang the Drum Slowly is a novel by Mark Harris, first published in 1956 by Knopf. The novel is the second in a series of four novels written by Harris that chronicles the career of baseball player Henry W. Wiggen. &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; was a sequel to &quot;The Southpaw&quot; (1953), with &quot;A Ticket for a Seamstitch&quot; (1957) and &quot;It Looked Like For Ever&quot; (1979), completing the tetralogy of baseball novels by Harris.

The novel was made into a 1956 &quot;United States Steel Hour&quot; television adaptation starring Paul Newman and a later film adaptation in 1973, with Harris writing the screenplay. &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; was named one of the top 100 sports books of all time by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and is the most popular of the four books published in this series, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The last line of the novel, &quot;From here on in I rag nobody&quot;, was ranked number 95 on &quot;American Book Review&quot;′s &quot;100 Best Last Lines from Novels&quot; in 2008.

==Background==
Harris played baseball as a boy and often wrote about the game and was known for writing realistically about the sport in his novels. For this novel, Harris chose to write it in the vernacular of pitcher Henry Wiggen, who narrates the story in an inimitable fashion. Harris called it &quot;ungrammar&quot; and said that the book was written &quot;out of a rebellion against formal language.&quot;

The title of the novel was inspired by lines from the song &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, which is about a dying cowboy. It is sung by one of the ballplayers, Piney Woods, a back-up catcher, at a team gathering. The version of the song that he sings contains the lyrics, &quot;Oh bang the drum slowly and play the fife lowly, and play the dead march as you carry me along...&quot;

==Plot summary==
Harris&#x27;s narrator Henry &quot;Author&quot; Wiggen, a star pitcher, tells the story of a baseball season with the New York Mammoths, a fictional team based on the New York Giants, as noted in the author&#x27;s book &quot;Diamond: The Baseball Writings of Mark Harris&quot;. In the novel, Wiggen befriends a slow-talking catcher from Georgia named Bruce Pearson who is more ridiculed than respected by his teammates. When Pearson learns he is terminally ill with Hodgkin’s disease and is to be sent to the minor leagues, Wiggen rallies his teammates to keep the catcher among them and inspires Pearson to become a better player before his time runs out.

==Reception==
One of the first reviews about the novel appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 1956, by book reviewer Charles Poore, who wrote that &quot;&quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; is the finest baseball novel that has appeared since we all began to compare baseball novels with the works of Ring Lardner, Douglass Wallop and Heywood Broun. In its elementals, &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; has two familiar themes. One is the story of the way a doomed man may spend his last best year on earth. The other is the story of how a quarrelsome group of raucous individualists is welded into an effective combat outfit.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; sports columnist George Vecsey, wrote about the book; “[it] has one of the loveliest last lines in American literature, a regret from Wiggen for the way the players made fun of a slow-witted and now-dead teammate: ‘From here on in, I rag nobody.’”

Cordelia Candelaria, author of &quot;Seeking the Perfect Game: Baseball in American Literature&quot;, rated &quot;The Southpaw&quot; and &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly&quot; among the top five baseball novels ever written. The novel was also chosen as one of the top 100 sports books of all time by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and the 1973 film adaption is featured on numerous other lists of best baseball movies.

==Adaptations==
The novel was first adapted for television and was broadcast live on the &quot;U.S. Steel Hour&quot; on September 24, 1956. It featured Paul Newman as Wiggen and Albert Salmi as catcher Bruce Pearson. George Peppard appeared as Piney Woods, the country-boy ballplayer who sings the ballad from which the novel&#x27;s title is derived. The TV adaptation was faithful to the first-person singular style of the novel, by having Wiggen (Newman) periodically step out of the movie to address the audience.

Harris wrote the screenplay for the 1973 film adaptation, with Michael Moriarty portraying Wiggen, Robert De Niro as Pearson and Vincent Gardenia as manager Dutch Schnell. Gardenia was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Schnell. De Niro was nominated and won Best Supporting Actor, from the New York Film Critics Circle for his role of Pearson. The movie was also Danny Aiello&#x27;s feature film debut. The film was directed by John D. Hancock and released by Paramount Pictures.

The novel was also adapted for the stage by Eric Simonson and had its professional premiere at the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston on March 11, 1994. The play was directed by Simonson, and David New starred as the &quot;Author&quot; Henry Wiggen, while Paul Sandberg played the role of catcher Bruce Pearson.

In 1992, Simonson partnered with L.A. Theatre Works to record an audiobook of the stage play adapted from the novel. The recording featured Ed Begley, Jr., David Schwimmer, Jonathan Silverman and Harry Shearer. The audio book is available to the general public in libraries and online retailers.

<doc id="1303375" wikidata="Q4863963" url="?curid=1303375" title="Barry Alvarez">
<text>Barry Lee Alvarez (born December 30, 1946) is an American former college football coach and athletic director at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He served as the head football coach at Wisconsin for 16 seasons, from 1990 to 2005, compiling a career record of 119–72–4. He has the longest head coaching tenure and the most wins in Wisconsin Badgers football history. Alvarez stepped down as head coach after the 2005 season, and remained as athletic director until July 1, 2021.

Since retiring, Alvarez has served as interim head coach on two occasions. He coached Wisconsin in the 2013 Rose Bowl, after the departure of Bret Bielema to the University of Arkansas, and in 2015 Outback Bowl, following the departure of Gary Andersen to Oregon State University.

Alvarez was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2010. In honor of his accomplishments, the Badgers announced in 2021 that the field within Camp Randall would be renamed to Barry Alvarez Field.

==Early life==
Alvarez was born and raised in Langeloth, Pennsylvania, where his family settled after his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Spain. He graduated from Burgettstown Union High School in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, and is a graduate of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, where he played linebacker from 1966 to 1968 under Bob Devaney, who became one of his major coaching influences along with Hayden Fry and Lou Holtz. Alvarez intercepted a pass in a game played between the Cornhuskers and the Badgers in Madison. Alvarez was an assistant coach in charge of the defense at Lincoln Northeast High School football team in Lincoln, Nebraska where his undefeated team won the City Championship, Trans-Nebraska Championship and were Co-Champions for the State of Nebraska, Class &#x27;A&#x27; in 1972. The team also won the I-80 Conference Championship Trophy, the Omaha World-Herald Merit Award and the Lincoln Journal and Star State Class &#x27;A&#x27; Football Champion Award. They have just celebrated their 50th Anniversary, on 23 September 2022, of that monumental event in which no team has matched that record in 50-years at the school. During that year his team played against and beat the Southeast Knights football team, coached by Frank Solich. Alvarez later became a head coach at Lexington High School in Lexington, Nebraska and then Mason City High School in Mason City, Iowa where the Mohawks won the 1978 class 4A state title, 15–13, over Dubuque Hempstead before becoming an assistant coach at University of Iowa and then at the University of Notre Dame.

From 1979 to 1986 at Iowa, Alvarez would coach linebackers such as Leven Weiss, Todd Simonsen, Mel Cole, James Erb, Jonathan Hayes, and Larry Station.

In 1987, Alvarez would coach linebacker Wes Pritchett. In 1988, he led the defense of a Notre Dame team that finished 12–0 as national champions. They finished 3rd in points allowed on the season. The players he coached that year included DL Jeff Alm, LB Frank Stams, and DB Todd Lyght. In 1989, the Notre Dame defense finished 9th in points allowed and the team finished 12–1.

==Head coaching career==
In 1990, Alvarez was named head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers. He inherited a program that had not had a winning season since 1984, and had only won seven games in Big Ten Conference play in that time.

Considering the awful state of the program he&#x27;d inherited, Alvarez engineered a very quick return to respectability. In recruiting players, Alvarez made the decision to &quot;build a wall&quot; around the state of Wisconsin, to make sure all of the state&#x27;s top recruits were going to be recruited to the program. He also encouraged walk-on players to try out for the team. According to Alvarez, he looked for two kinds of players for his team: Players who loved football, and players that were tough. He won only eleven games in his first three seasons (including a 1–10 record in his first year). However, the 1992 team showed signs of the future to come. That team upset Ohio State on national television, and four of its losses were by a touchdown or less. One of those losses, to Northwestern, kept Wisconsin out of a bowl.

The Badgers steamrolled through the 1993 season, notching a 10–1–1 mark and their first Rose Bowl appearance since 1963, along with only the second bowl win in school history. During his tenure, the Badgers won or shared three Big Ten titles and played in three Rose Bowls (1994, 1999 and 2000), winning all three of them. He also led the Badgers to 11 bowl games, winning 8 of them; before his arrival they had been to only six bowls in their entire history, with only one win. The 1998 team notched the first 11-win season in school history, while the 1999 team won the school&#x27;s first outright Big Ten title in 37 years.

Alvarez retired for the first time at Wisconsin with a win over the Auburn Tigers in the 2006 Capital One Bowl. Following his two interim stints as the team&#x27;s coach, his all-time record at Wisconsin to 120–73–4 (), making him far and away the winningest coach in school history; his 120 wins are almost double those of runner-up Phillip King. His record in bowl games is 9–4 ().

Alvarez is the only Big Ten Conference coach to win consecutive Rose Bowls. Prior to his first return as interim coach, his 3–0 Rose Bowl record as a full-time coach had placed him third on the list of undefeated Rose Bowl records, behind USC&#x27;s Howard Jones (5–0) and John Robinson (4–0). On December 5, 2012, the day after the 2012 Big Ten Championship Game, Badgers head coach Bret Bielema announced he would be leaving to take the Arkansas head coaching position and revealed to the media that Alvarez would be the interim coach for the Badgers in the 2013 Rose Bowl. The Badgers lost that game to the Stanford Cardinal 20–14, dropping Alvarez&#x27;s Rose Bowl record to 3–1.

Alvarez is the only Big Ten coach with consecutive wins over the Ohio State Buckeyes during Jim Tressel&#x27;s coaching tenure there; those came in 2003 and 2004. He finished his career with a 3–1 edge over Tressel. Alvarez had six seasons with at least nine wins at Wisconsin. Prior to his arrival, the Badgers had recorded only four in nearly 100 seasons (1897–1899, 1901). (Wisconsin has regularly played a season schedule of nine or more games from 1942 onward.)

==Life after coaching==
Alvarez replaced Pat Richter as athletic director in 2004 while retaining the head coaching position. After the 2005 season, Alvarez stepped down as head coach. Due to his continuing role as athletic director, Alvarez had the rare opportunity to choose his successor. Alvarez promoted his defensive coordinator, Bret Bielema.

In 2006, Alvarez released his autobiography, &quot;Don&#x27;t Flinch&quot;, co-authored by Mike Lucas.

During the 2006–07 bowl season, Alvarez worked as a color commentator/analyst for Fox Sports. He worked both the 2007 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 BCS National Championship Game as well as select NFL games.

In 2010, it was revealed that he had invested $600,000 in the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Nevin Shapiro.

Starting with the 2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season, the Bowl Championship Series was abandoned in favor of a four-team playoff to determine a national champion. Alvarez was one of the thirteen inaugural members of the College Football Playoff selection committee.

==Honors and awards==
Prior to his arrival at Wisconsin, Alvarez was part of Lou Holtz&#x27;s staff at Notre Dame from 1987 to 1989. He was the defensive coordinator for the 1988 and 1989 teams which lost a single game in these two seasons and were named national champions in 1988.

During his head coaching tenure, Alvarez received national recognition as the recipient of the AFCA Coach of the Year and Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award in 1993. He was twice honored as the Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year, in 1993 and 1998.

In 1994, Babcock Dairy Store, run by the UW–Madison&#x27;s Department of Food Science, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, developed an ice cream flavor called &quot;Berry Alvarez&quot;, a mixture of raspberry, strawberry, and blueberry, in his honor. In 2001, &quot;Hispanic Business&quot; magazine named Barry Alvarez one of the &quot;100 Most Influential Hispanics&quot;.

On October 13, 2006, a bronze statue of Alvarez was unveiled in the Kellner Plaza of Camp Randall Stadium. The statue honoring Alvarez had been announced the previous year, at his last home game as head coach.

In 2009, Alvarez was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame and the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. On May 27, 2010, it was announced that Alvarez would be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as part of the 2010 class. It was further revealed that the induction vote for Alvarez was unanimous.

<text>George Washington Greene (April 8, 1811 – February 2, 1883) was an American historian. He was also the grandson of Major-General Nathanael Greene, a hero of the American Revolutionary War.

==Biography==
Greene was born in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, to Nathanael Ray Greene and Anna Maria Greene (née Clarke). He was named by his grandmother Catherine (Littlefield) Greene, after the General George Washington. In 1824, as a young teenager, Greene entered Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine. But, during his junior year, he withdrew on account of poor health.

Greene traveled to Europe in the hopes of improving his health. In 1828, while in Italy, he befriended Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and served as the aspiring poet&#x27;s traveling companion; their friendship lasted 54 years. Greene was in Europe during the majority of the next twenty years, except in 1833–1834, when he was principal of Kent Academy at East Greenwich. He served as the United States consul in Rome from 1837 to 1845.

He married Maria Carlotta Sforzosi, an Italian teenager, in 1828. She traveled with him to Rhode Island and met his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow there. The marriage lasted about 20 years before they got a divorce in Italy. &quot;Greene had been having domestic troubles, the facts of which are obscure. After losing his consulship in Rome, he returned to the United States in 1847 without his wife. In a letter of July 30, 1849, to Nicholas Brown, his successor as consul, Greene seems to imply that efforts were being made in Italy to annul his marriage; and in a postscript he refers to a rumor that Maria Carlotta died of a ‘putrid fever’ in Florence in May 1849 (MS, Brown University). Whatever the circumstances, Greene obtained a divorce in 1850. That Longfellow was deeply disturbed by the failure of this marriage is made clear by Greene in a letter to Sumner dated July 34, 1849: ‘I had some faint hope that he [Longfellow] might have written me – but I fear that the blow that has left me alone in the world – has broken the last tie between us.’ (MS Harvard College Library).&quot;

Greene found love again five years later. Longfellow heard from his and Charles Sumner’s mutual friend &quot;that Greene is engaged to Miss Porter of Providence, a girl of eighteen, with no dower but her beaux yeux.&quot; Catherine Van Buren Porter was 20 years younger than Greene. They married on February 8, 1852.

He was instructor in modern languages at Brown University from 1848 to 1852. In 1853, he edited Joseph Addison&#x27;s works, with copious notes (6 vols., New York). He took up residence in East Greenwich once again in 1865; not long afterward he was chosen to represent the town in the Rhode Island General Assembly. He made speeches in 1867 and 1869 on the ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.

In 1871-1875 he was a non-resident lecturer in American history in the Department of History at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. When he returned to East Greenwich, his good friend Longfellow purchased a home for him, which is still standing at 144 Division Street. Shortly after, a windmill was attached to the house.
Greene died at East Greenwich, Rhode Island, on February 2, 1883. His grave lies next to his father&#x27;s, in Newport, Rhode Island.

<text>Samuel Roger Horchow (July 3, 1928 – May 2, 2020) was an American retailer and Broadway producer.

Horchow was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Beatrice (Schwartz) and Reuben Horchow, an attorney. In 1971, he started The Horchow Collection, the first luxury mail-order catalog that was not preceded by a brick-and-mortar presence. He sold the Horchow Collection to Neiman Marcus in 1988.

In 1992, he produced his first Broadway show, &quot;Crazy for You&quot;, a George Gershwin musical, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Musical. The London version of &quot;Crazy for You&quot; won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical. Though &quot;Crazy for You&quot; was inspired by an earlier Gershwin musical, &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, which opened in 1930, theater critics and the American Theater Wing ultimately considered it to be a &quot;new musical.&quot; &quot;Crazy for You&quot; was directed by Mike Ockrent and choreographed by Susan Stroman.

In 2000, Horchow and co-producer Roger Berlind staged a revival of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, for which he won his second Tony Award, for Best Musical Revival.

In 2007, Horchow along with other producers produced &quot;Curtains&quot;, a comedic murder mystery nominated for 8 Tony awards and 10 Drama Desk awards and in 2008 was a minor producer in the Broadway revival of &quot;Gypsy&quot; with Patti LuPone.

Horchow was a member of The Hill School Class of 1945. In 2002 he received the school&#x27;s highest alumni honor, The Sixth Form Leadership Award. Horchow was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater, Yale University, in 1999, and is one of the subjects of &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; (Little, Brown, 2000) 2002 edition , an influential book by &quot;New Yorker&quot; writer Malcolm Gladwell.

Horchow was the author of three books, &quot;The Art of Friendship: 70 Simple Rules for Making Meaningful Connections&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 2006 and Neiman Marcus Exclusive, 2005) , &quot;Elephants in Your Mailbox: How I Learned the Secrets of Mail-Order Marketing Despite Having Made 25 Horrendous Mistakes&quot; (Times Books, 1980) , and &quot;Living in Style: In A Time When Taste Means More Than Money&quot; (Rawson Assoc, 1981) .

Horchow was on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. Horchow served on the board of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Whitney Museum, Dallas Museum of Art and Yale University Art Gallery. He was Vice-Chairman of KERA Public Radio, Dallas, TX. Dallas Theater Center, Foundation for Arts and Preservation in Embassies, Direct Relief International (Advisory Board). His wife, Carolyn Pfeifer, died in 2009.

Horchow lived in Dallas and had three daughters and five granddaughters.

<text>Gaston Bullock Means (July 11, 1879 – December 12, 1938) was an American private detective, salesman, bootlegger, forger, swindler, murder suspect, blackmailer, and con artist.

While not involved in the Teapot Dome scandal, Means was associated with other members of the so-called Ohio Gang that gathered around the administration of President Warren G. Harding. Means also tried to pull a con associated with the Lindbergh kidnapping, and died in prison following his criminal conviction.

==Biography==
Gaston Bullock Means was born in Concord, North Carolina, the son of William Means, a reputable lawyer. He was also a great-nephew of Confederate General Rufus Barringer. He was in the first graduating class of Concord High School in 1896, graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1903, became a schoolteacher, then a travelling salesman. His life avocation, however, was that of a confidence trickster. J. Edgar Hoover once called him &quot;the most amazing figure in contemporary criminal history&quot; because of his ability to weave a believable, albeit fraudulent, story. In 1911, he talked himself into a job with a New York detective firm where he created reports that contained so many clues that they must either be investigated further (at a substantial cost) or denounced utterly. His reputation spread. On the eve of World War I, he was asked to further Germany&#x27;s interests in the neutral United States. He &quot;uncovered&quot; plots and counterplots rife with secret documents and skulking spies, all of which required investigation at his usual rate of $100 (gold standard dollars) per day. After America declared war on Germany, Means returned to being a private detective. There, he was given a case involving Maude King, the widow of a wealthy lumberman, who had fallen into the clutches of a swindler in Europe. King had been left $100,000 by her late husband, with the remainder of his $3 million estate intended for charity. She sued for more and settled for $600,000 plus the interest on $400,000. Means ingratiated himself into King&#x27;s life and assisted her with her business affairs. Under the guise of investing her money, Means deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars to his own credit in New York and Chicago, invested in cotton and the stock market and lost heavily. Claiming to find a new will which required &quot;investigation&quot;, Means plundered the remainder of the woman&#x27;s finances until they were nearly all gone. On August 29, 1917, the widow went with Means to a firing range. Means returned with her body, claiming she had killed herself, perhaps accidentally while handling his gun.

Means&#x27; account was disputed by the coroner; no powder marks were found near the wound in her head, discounting a self-inflicted wound. Maude was fearful of pistols and she was planning to remarry. Means was indicted for murder and after deliberating for only 15 minutes, a jury in his home town acquitted him, after defense counsel cleverly whipped up local jury resentment against New York lawyers who were assisting the prosecution. The will was declared a forgery and Means was prosecuted. Testimony showed that the witnesses to the purported will were out of town on the day it was signed, the typewriter used to type the document had not yet been manufactured when the will was purportedly written and King&#x27;s signature and those of other witnesses were not genuine.

The trial was going badly for Means when he declared that he knew the location of a trunk filled with secret documents obtained from German spies. In exchange for a letter to the judge attesting to his good character from the United States Army, he said, he would hand over that trunk. An Army Intelligence officer was assigned to accompany Means to locate the trunk, which he did, handing it over on the condition that it be sent to Washington intact. Then, baggage claim in hand, he hurried to Washington, declared he had kept his end of the bargain and demanded the promised letter attesting to his good service. Alas, the trunk arrived and it was found to contain no documents. Declaring he knew who had done this &quot;despicable thing&quot;, Means promised to find the scoundrels and recover the lost papers. The army investigated and discovered the weight of the trunk when sent was identical to its weight when opened.

In later years, Means boasted to friends that he had been accused of every felony in the criminal law books, up to and including murder. Although he had a shady reputation as a detective, in October 1921, Means was hired by the Bureau of Investigation and he moved to Washington, D.C. The FBI was then led by William J. Burns, famous ex-Secret Service man, private detective and friend of Harry M. Daugherty, Attorney General in the Harding administration. Burns had employed Means as a detective and thought Means had great skill as an investigator and an extortionist. Despite the protection of his patron, Means was later suspended from the FBI at the insistence of Daugherty, who had become increasingly aware that Means was a loose cannon.

===Bootleggers&#x27; helper===
Although the United States was officially &quot;dry&quot; during the Harding years as a result of Prohibition, illegal alcohol was common. In the late fall of 1922, Means began selling his services to local Washington bootleggers, with the offer that he could use his connections to &quot;fix&quot; their legal problems with the government.

In 1924, following Harding&#x27;s death, Congress held hearings on the Justice Department&#x27;s role in failing to oversee their Prohibition duties under the Volstead Act. Means testified against former Attorney General Daugherty. Means &quot;confessed&quot; to handling bribes for senior officials in the former Harding Administration. He declared the country was being despoiled and that he had the documents to prove it. When asked to produce them, Means readily agreed but returned with a story that &quot;two sergeants-at-arms&quot; had appeared at his home, produced an order signed by the head of the committee and had taken the documents away with them. The committee head examined the &quot;order&quot; and declared his signature a forgery. Means leaped from his chair. &quot;Forgery!&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve been tricked by my enemies. I&#x27;ll run them down if it&#x27;s the last thing I do!&quot; After testifying before the Brookhart-Wheeler committee, Gaston Means signed an affidavit stating that his entire testimony was false and that he had only given it because senator Burton Wheeler had promised to get the then current charges against him dismissed. Means further admitted in his affidavit that he had coached the other witness in the case, Roxie Stinson.

The congressional investigation also revealed evidence of Means&#x27;s role in the illegal issuance of Prohibition-era liquor permits. Means was indicted for perjury and tried before a jury. In intentionally sensational testimony, Means implicated both Harding and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon as being part of the cover-up. Unable to support his own counter-charges and unable to convince the jury of his innocence, Means was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to two years in federal prison.

===Professional con man===
During and after his term in the federal penitentiary, Means retained his reputation as the ultimate man who knew all of the secrets. He put this reputation to work in his book, &quot;The Strange Death of President Harding&quot; (1930). The exposé alleged that Harding had been consciously complicit in all of the major scandals of his administration. The book&#x27;s status as a bestseller derived in considerable measure from its insinuation that the President had been murdered by his wife, First Lady Florence Harding, with assistance from the couple&#x27;s personal physician, Charles E. Sawyer. Mrs. Harding&#x27;s alleged motivation was that she had become aware of her husband&#x27;s corruption and marital infidelity and wanted to protect his reputation.

Means&#x27; accusations seemed to some to be true. The writer had learned many facts about Harding&#x27;s sex life from the rumor mill in Washington. A 1933 counter-exposé, published in &quot;Liberty&quot;, blew the cover off of the dubious book. Part-time journalistic stringer Mae Dixon Thacker confessed that not only had she ghostwritten the book for Means but also that Means had bilked her out of her share of the profits. Mrs. Thacker further stated that Means had never provided the documents he swore he had that backed his accusations. Upon further investigation, Thacker had found the accounts Means made in the book were completely false and she stated in Liberty Magazine that the book was a &quot;colossal hoax – a tissue of falsehood from beginning to end.&quot;

Having collected his royalties, Means cheerfully repudiated his own book. He had moved on to a new set of victims, a group of New York men who were interested in subversive Soviet activities. Means claimed to have the goods on two Soviets intent on wreaking havoc in the United States with $2 million earmarked for that purpose. He took on the case at his usual price of $100 per day. His investigation dragged out for three years as Means promised to bring the secret agents to justice and to capture 24 trunks and 11 suitcases full of secret orders, plans and diaries. He claimed several times that he almost got those trunks and suitcases and once did so, he said, but upon his return to New York, the secret agents stole them back again. Finally, he delivered the news that one of the Russians had murdered the other and all the documents had been burned. He told his story so convincingly that an arrest warrant was sworn out against the killer, for a murder that existed only in Means&#x27;s imagination.

Following the Lindbergh kidnapping of 1932, Means attempted the most audacious con job of his career. Means was contacted by the Washington socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean (owner of the Hope Diamond), who asked him to use his connections in the East Coast underworld to assist in the recovery of the Lindbergh child. Means declared that he knew the whereabouts of the victim. He offered his services as a go-between and asked for $100,000 to pass on to the kidnappers. The credulous McLean sent Means the money and Means promptly disappeared, while a confederate kept McLean apprised of Means&#x27;s difficulties and the fabulous chase. Means later came to McLean at her home again and said he would need an additional $4,000 to pay the expenses of the kidnappers; she had a $6,000 check cashed at one of the banks in Washington and turned $4,000 over to him. Finally, Means met McLean in a southern resort, promising to deliver the baby. Instead, he showed up with a man he introduced as the &quot;King of the Kidnappers&quot;, who told her how and when the baby would be delivered. Everyone was given a code, Means was No. 27, the &quot;King&quot; was No. 19, Norman Tweed Whitaker was &quot;The Fox&quot;, McLean was No. 11, and the baby was &quot;The Book&quot;. The missing baby (who was later found murdered) did not show up and the next thing that McLean heard from Means was a demand for another $35,000. Failing to raise it, the heiress demanded all the money back. Means agreed, hurried to get it – and didn&#x27;t come back. Confronted about his duplicity, Means expressed astonishment. &quot;Didn&#x27;t Mrs. McLean get it?&quot;, he asked. &quot;She must have it. Her messenger met me at the bridge outside Alexandria as I was returning to Washington. He said &#x27;I am Number 11.&#x27; So what was I to do? I gave him the money.&quot; This time, the heiress called the police, Means was captured, found guilty of grand larceny, and sentenced to serve 15 years in a federal penitentiary but the money was never recovered. Means was assigned, transported, and imprisoned at the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, where he died in custody in 1938.

==In popular culture==
Gaston Means appears in the third and fourth seasons of the TV series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, played by Stephen Root. Means is portrayed as a kind of confidence man who sells information to people like Nucky Thompson, or does the dirty work of politicos like Attorney General Daugherty. He agrees to murder Daugherty&#x27;s friend and associate Jess Smith only to have Smith commit suicide before he can do the deed. This alludes to the historical ambiguity over whether Smith&#x27;s death was murder or suicide. The fictional Means was arrested for perjury—just as in real life—in season four of the show.

Means is also mentioned in the book &quot;Go Set a Watchman&quot;, by Harper Lee.

<doc id="1303401" wikidata="Q77185" url="?curid=1303401" title="Countess Marie Larisch von Moennich">
<text>Countess Marie Louise Larisch von Moennich (also known as Countess Marie Louise Larisch-Wallersee and Countess Marie Larisch) (24 February 1858 – 4 July 1940) was
a niece and lady-in-waiting of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and a morganatic descendant of Dukes in Bavaria, collateral branch of the House of Wittelsbach. She was implicated in the Mayerling Incident which resulted in the death of her married cousin Crown Prince Rudolf and his mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera, who was also her friend. She published several books with a ghostwriter about the Imperial household.

==Early life==
The Countess was born Marie Louise Elizabeth Mendel on 24 February 1858 in Augsburg, Bavaria, the illegitimate daughter of Duke Ludwig Wilhelm in Bavaria (1831–1920) and an actress, Henriette Mendel (1833–1891). Her father, Ludwig Wilhelm, was the eldest son of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria and had the title of Duke in Bavaria (German: &quot;Herzog in Bayern&quot;). He was properly addressed as &quot;His Royal Highness,&quot; as a member of the cadet branch of the House of Wittelsbach - the royal house in Bavaria. Ludwig Wilhelm was the first cousin of King Maximilian II of Bavaria and also of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, whose mother, Princess Sophie of Bavaria, was a daughter of King Maximilian I of Bavaria. One of Ludwig Wilhelm&#x27;s younger sisters, Elisabeth, married Emperor Franz Joseph and another, Maria Sophie, married Francis II of the Two Sicilies just before he became king. Henriette (or Henrietta) Mendel was created Baroness of Wallersee (&quot;Freifrau von Wallersee&quot;) on 19 May 1859 in preparation for her morganatic marriage with Ludwig Wilhelm on 28 May 1859 in Augsburg. Marie was thus a Baroness of Wallersee (&quot;Freiin von Wallersee&quot;) at birth. Marie became a lady-in-waiting and confidante of her aunt, Empress Elisabeth of Austria.

==Early adulthood==

Marie received financial support from her cousin Crown Prince Rudolf. 
On 30 January 1889, Rudolf shot his 17-year-old mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera and committed suicide - a scandal known as the Mayerling Incident. It was subsequently revealed that Marie Larisch had acted as go-between for Rudolf and Mary Vetsera. She also used the situation to extort money from Rudolf through Mary. After the incident, she became distanced from Empress Elisabeth and the nobility, and moved to Bavaria.

==Writer==
From 1898, Marie began to write about her experiences with the Empress and other Imperial and Royal relatives. The Imperial house paid her &quot;hush money&quot; not to publish her memoirs. However, in 1913, she published her memoirs, &quot;My Past&quot;, despite her contract with the Imperial house. She later published a series of other ghost-written works.

==World War I and its aftermath==
During World War I she worked at the front as a nurse. In 1921, she portrayed herself in a silent film, &quot;Kaiserin Elisabeth von Österreich&quot;, about Empress Elisabeth that she co-authored.

== Personal life ==
On 20 October 1877, at Jagdschloß Gödöllő in Hungary, she married Count Georg Larisch von Moennich, Baron of Ellgoth and Karwin (1855–1928), second child and the only son of Count Leo Larisch von Mönnich (1824-1872) and his Romanian wife, Princess Irina Stirbey (1831-1864). The marriage had been arranged by the Empress. They had 5 children:
* Count Franz Joseph Larisch von Möennich (1878-1937); married to Maria Satterfield (1879-1947) and had issue
* Countess Marie Valerie Larisch von Möennich (1879-1907)
* Countess Marie Henriette Larisch von Möennich (1884-1907); her biological father was Heinrich Baltazzi (1858-1929)
* Count Heinrich Georg Larisch von Möennich (1886-1909); his biological father was also Heinrich Baltazzi (1858-1929)
* Count Friedrich Karl Larisch von Möennich (1894-1929); his biological father was Karl Ernst von Otto-Kreckwitz (1861-1938)

After divorcing Count Larisch on 3 December 1896, she married musician Otto Brucks (1854–1914) in Munich on 15 May 1897. They had one child, Otto (1899–1977). Her second husband&#x27;s career foundered due to his association with &quot;that Countess Larisch&quot; and his dependency on alcohol. In 1906, her second husband became director of the theatre of Metz. He died in 1914. 

On 2 September 1924, she married for the third time naturopath William H. Meyers (1859-1930) in Elizabeth, New Jersey and they lived in Florida. In 1924, an article was published in New York claiming that she would marry anybody who would pay her and her son the fare to America. In 1926, she fled to New Jersey, to work as a housemaid. She returned to Germany in 1929.

==Death==
Marie died in 1940 in a nursing home at Augsburg and was buried in the Ostfriedhof in Munich.

==Works==
*1913: &quot;My Past&quot; 
*1934: &quot;Secrets of a Royal House&quot; 
*1936: &quot;My Royal Relatives&quot;. In this work she claims to have been the daughter of Marie, Queen of the Two Sicilies by &quot;Count Armand de Lavaÿss&quot;

==Legacy==
Marie met and conversed with the poet T. S. Eliot, and part of their conversation found its way into his epochal poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.
:And when we were children, staying at the archduke&#x27;s,
:My cousin&#x27;s, he took me out on a sled,
:And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
:Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
:In the mountains, there you feel free.
:I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

<doc id="1303406" wikidata="Q3540369" url="?curid=1303406" title="Chappell–Hadlee Trophy">
<text>The Chappell–Hadlee Trophy in cricket is a One Day International &amp; Twenty20 International cricket series between Australia and New Zealand. It is named after legendary cricketing families from the two countries: the Chappell brothers (Ian, Gregory, and Trevor) of Australia, and Walter Hadlee and his three sons (Barry, Dayle and Sir Richard) of New Zealand. Australia have recorded eight series wins to New Zealand&#x27;s four.

In February 2024, both Cricket Australia (CA) and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) announced that, the trophy will be contested over both ODI and T20I formats in order to increase its exposure and profile. The change also meant that when the two teams face off in back-to-back ODI and T20I series, there would be a points structure including both formats so as to prevent the trophy from changing hands within days.

The trophy was contested annually from 2004–05 until 2009–10 as a three- or five-match series, and as a one-match series during the group stage of the World Cups in 2011 and 2015. Although the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final was also contested between the same teams, that game was not considered to be a part of this trophy. The 2017–18 edition was replaced with the 2017–18 Trans-Tasman Tri-Series, but the series partially went ahead as planned in Australia in 2019–20. With only one ODI being played in 2019–20 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for a rescheduled three match ODI series against New Zealand, ultimately being played in September 2022 after being postponed numerous times.

==Trophy history==

Chappell–Hadlee Trophy matches have seen several notable results and records broken:
*New Zealand has completed three notably large run chases in Chappell–Hadlee Trophy matches. In the third ODI in 2005–06 in Christchurch, New Zealand, successfully chased Australia&#x27;s total of 332, setting a new record for the highest run chase in ODI history; this record was surpassed by South Africa later in the 2005–06 season. Then, in the 2006–07 series, New Zealand successfully chased 336 in the second ODI in Auckland, and successfully chased 346 in the third ODI in Hamilton. For a time, these three matches were the second, third and fourth-highest run chases in ODI history.
*In the first ODI in 2006–07 in Wellington, Australia was beaten by 10 wickets for the first time in ODI history. This was Australia&#x27;s 646th ODI match.
*After its loss in the second ODI in 2006–07 in Auckland, Australia lost the top spot in the ICC ODI Championship for the first time since the standings were introduced in October 2002, ending a streak of 52 consecutive months at the top.
* In the third ODI in 2006–07 in Hamilton, Matthew Hayden scored 181 not out for Australia in the first innings, setting a new record for the highest individual innings by an Australian batsman; this record stood until 2011. Craig McMillan then scored a century in 67 balls in the second innings, which (until 1 January 2014, when both Corey Anderson (off 36 balls) and Jesse Ryder (off 46 balls) broke this record in the 3rd ODI vs West Indies in Queenstown) was the fastest ever ODI century by a New Zealand batsman.

<doc id="1303410" wikidata="Q922483" url="?curid=1303410" title="William Orpen">
<text>Major Sir William Newenham Montague Orpen, (27 November 1878 – 29 September 1931) was an Irish artist who mainly worked in London. Orpen was a fine draughtsman and a popular, commercially successful painter of portraits for the well-to-do in Edwardian society, though many of his most striking paintings are self-portraits.

During World War I, he was the most prolific of the official war artists sent by Britain to the Western Front. There he produced drawings and paintings of ordinary soldiers, dead men, and German prisoners of war, as well as portraits of generals and politicians. Most of these works, 138 in all, he donated to the British government; they are now in the collection of the Imperial War Museum. His connections to the senior ranks of the British Army allowed him to stay in France longer than any of the other official war artists, and although he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 Birthday Honours, and also elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts, his determination to serve as a war artist cost him both his health and his social standing in Britain.

After his early death a number of critics, including other artists, were loudly dismissive of Orpen&#x27;s work, and for many years his paintings were rarely exhibited, a situation that only began to change in the 1980s.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Born in Stillorgan, County Dublin, William Orpen was the fourth and youngest son of Arthur Herbert Orpen (1830–1926), a solicitor, and his wife, Anne Caulfield (1834–1912), the eldest daughter of the Right Rev. Charles Caulfield (1804–1862), the Bishop of Nassau. Both his parents were amateur painters, and his eldest brother, Richard Caulfield Orpen, became a notable architect. His nieces were Bea Orpen and Kathleen Delap. The historian Goddard Henry Orpen was his second cousin. The family lived at &#x27;Oriel&#x27;, a large house with extensive grounds containing stables and a tennis court. Orpen appears to have had a happy childhood there.

Orpen was a naturally talented painter, and six weeks before his thirteenth birthday was enrolled at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. During his six years at the college, he won every major prize there, plus the British Isles gold medal for life drawing, before leaving to study at the Slade School of Art between 1897 and 1899. At the Slade he mastered oil painting and began to experiment with different painting techniques and effects. Orpen would include mirrors in his pictures to create images within images, add false frames and collages around his subjects, and often make pictorial references to works by other artists in his own paintings. His two-metre-wide painting &quot;The Play Scene from Hamlet&quot; won the Slade composition prize in 1899. His teachers at the Slade included Henry Tonks, Philip Wilson Steer and Frederick Brown, all of whom were members of the New English Art Club; they ensured he exhibited there in 1899, and that he became a member in 1900. Orpen&#x27;s &quot;The Mirror&quot;, shown at the NEAC in 1900, references both Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; of 1434 and also elements of seventeenth-century Dutch interiors, such as muted tones and deep shadows. Orpen depicted the &#x27;Arnolfini&#x27; convex glass in several other paintings, including &quot;A Mere Fracture&quot; in 1901, during this period. Also in 1901, he held a solo exhibition at the Carfax Gallery in central London.

Whilst at the Slade, he became engaged to Emily Scobel, a model and the subject of &quot;The Mirror&quot;. She ended their relationship in 1901, and Orpen married Grace Knewstub, the sister-in-law of Sir William Rothenstein. Orpen and Knewstub had three daughters together, but the marriage was not a happy one; by 1908, Orpen had begun a long-running affair with Mrs Evelyn Saint-George, a well-connected American millionairess based in London, with whom he also had a child.

===Early career===

After he left the Slade, from 1903 to 1907, Orpen ran a private teaching studio, the Chelsea Art School, at Rossetti Mansions near the King&#x27;s Road with his fellow Slade graduate Augustus John. Between 1902 and 1915, Orpen divided his time between London and Dublin. He taught at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, and his teaching influenced a generation of young Irish artists. His pupils included Seán Keating, Grace Gifford, Patrick Tuohy, Leo Whelan and Margaret Clarke. This was the period of the Celtic revival in Ireland and, responding to the growth of new literary and other cultural developments, Orpen painted three large allegorical paintings: &quot;Sowing New Seed&quot;, &quot;The Western Wedding&quot; and &quot;The Holy Well&quot;. A key figure in the Celtic Revival was Hugh Lane, who was a friend and mentor to Orpen, and who begin collecting impressionist art works with Orpen&#x27;s guidance. In the summer of 1904 Orpen and Lane visited Paris and Madrid together, and some years later Lane commissioned a series of portraits of contemporary Irish figures from Orpen for the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art in Dublin. From 1908 onwards, Orpen exhibited works in the Royal Academy on a regular basis. Between 1908 and 1912, Orpen and his family spent the summer on the coast at Howth, north of Dublin, where he began painting in the open air and developed a distinctive &quot;plein-air&quot; style that featured figures composed of touches of colour without a drawn outline. The most notable of these works was &quot;Midday on the Beach&quot;, shown at the NEAC in 1910.

Between 1911 and 1913, in London, Orpen painted a series of portraits, mostly three-quarter-length, of Vera Brewster, the wife of the writer Joe Horne. These included the paintings &quot;The Roscommon Dragoon&quot;, &quot;The Irish Volunteer&quot; and &quot;The Angler&quot;. John Singer Sargent promoted Orpen&#x27;s work and he soon built a lucrative reputation, in both London and Dublin, for painting society portraits. &quot;Mrs St. George&quot;, (1912), and &quot;Lady Rocksavage&quot; (1913), both demonstrate Orpen&#x27;s ability to produce the swagger portraits that Edwardian high society greatly valued. Group portraits of a type known as conversation pieces were also hugely popular and Orpen painted several, most notably &quot;The Cafe Royal in London&quot; (1912), and &quot;Homage to Manet&quot; (1909), which showed Walter Sickert and several other artists and critics seated in front of Édouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Eva Gonzalies&quot;. Orpen had worked on &quot;Homage to Manet&quot; since 1906 at his studio in South Bolton Gardens in Chelsea, where Lane also had rooms. By the start of World War I, Orpen was the most famous and most commercially successful artist working in Britain.

===World War One===

At the start of World War One, a number of Irish people living in England returned to Ireland to avoid conscription. Among them was Orpen&#x27;s studio assistant and former pupil, Seán Keating. Keating encouraged Orpen to do likewise, but he refused and committed himself to supporting the British war effort. In December 1915 Orpen was commissioned into the Army Service Corps and reported for clerical duty at London&#x27;s Kensington Barracks in March 1916. Throughout 1916 Orpen continued painting portraits, most notably one of a despondent Winston Churchill, but soon started using both his own contacts and those of Evelyn Saint-George, to secure a war artist posting. Orpen knew both Philip Sassoon, the private secretary to Sir Douglas Haig, and also Sir John Cowans, the Quartermaster General of the British Army. In January 1917, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Haig himself had &quot;conferred&quot; on Orpen the title of an official artist with the British Army in France. The Department of Information, who were actually running the British war artist scheme, were given little choice but to accept the situation. While the other artists on the Department scheme remained at the honorary rank of second lieutenant and were restricted to three weeks visiting the Western Front, Orpen was promoted to major and given indefinite permission to remain at the Front. An officer from Kensington Barracks was appointed as his military aide, a car and driver were made available in France and Orpen paid for a batman and assistant to accompany him.

In April 1917, Orpen travelled to the Somme and based himself in Amiens. Orpen had arrived on the Somme three weeks after the German forces had pulled back to the Hindenburg Line. Each day Orpen would be driven to locations such as Thiepval, Beaumont-Hamel or Ovillers-la-Boisselle to sketch Allied troops or German prisoners and record the devastation left by the Battle of the Somme amid the frozen and desolate landscape. However he did not submit any work to the Department of Information nor to the military censor. When he was reprimanded for that, he had Haig&#x27;s office move the officer who had issued the reprimand to other duties. In May 1917, he painted portraits of both Haig and Sir Hugh Trenchard, the commander of the Royal Flying Corps, and both of these images were widely reproduced in British newspapers and magazines. In June Orpen moved to the Ypres Salient and stayed at Cassel in the Hotel Sauvage, where he painted the self-portrait known as &quot;Ready to Start&quot;.

====The Somme battlefield====

Orpen returned to the Somme in August 1917 and found the landscape transformed. Writing in 1921, he described the scene: &quot;I had left it mud, nothing but water, shell-holes and mud – the most gloomy dreary abomination of desolation the mind could imagine; and now, in the summer of 1917, no words could express the beauty of it. The dreary, dismal mud was baked white and pure – dazzling white. White daisies, red poppies and a blue flower, great masses of them, stretched for miles and miles. The sky a pure dark blue, and the whole air, up to a height of about forty feet, thick with white butterflies: your clothes were covered with butterflies. It was like an enchanted land: but in the place of fairies there were thousands of little white crosses, marked &#x27;Unknown British Soldier&#x27;, for the most part.&quot;
Orpen was well aware that this landscape was a vast graveyard. Throughout the summer of 1917, other than Orpen and his driver and assistant, the only people on the empty battlefield around Thiepval were the British and Allied burial parties working to identify and inter the thousands of bodies left in the open or in abandoned trenches and dugouts. As he travelled across this landscape Orpen frequently encountered dead bodies and human remains, often little more, he wrote, than &quot;skulls, bones, garments&quot;. On the Somme, Orpen pushed himself to find artistic and pictorial strategies adequate to the situation. He stopped using half-tones and half-shades and adopted a new palette of colours, characterised by the extensive use of weak purples, mauves and bright green, with large white spaces representing the effect of bright sunlight on the chalk soil, all under a strong cobalt blue sky. 

In &quot;Dead Germans in a Trench&quot; his use of blue-green for the bodies indicates putrefaction, while the bright colouring of the trench increases the disturbing sense of the picture. Amid the derelict trenches, Orpen claimed to have encountered soldiers who had been traumatised and shell-shocked by the fighting and made, at least, two paintings, &quot;A Man with a Cigarette&quot; and &quot;Blown Up, Mad&quot;, based on these meetings. 

Others regard the two figures as purely allegorical representations of sacrifice and suffering. In particular, the soldier in &quot;Blown Up, Mad&quot; has been likened to early Renaissance depictions of the risen Christ emerging from the tomb.

Following the success of his Haig and Trenchard portraits, Orpen was asked to paint portraits of several pilots in the Royal Flying Corps. He spent part of September 1917 visiting airfields and during October 1917 he was based with No. 56 Squadron near Cassel. His portrait of Lieutenant Reginald Hoidge, MC and Bar, was painted a few hours after the young pilot had been in a dogfight and Orpen was greatly impressed by his calmness. Orpen&#x27;s portrait of Arthur Rhys-Davids, DSO MC, is also crisply drawn with rich colours and lush shadows. 

Rhys-Davids was killed in combat within a week of sitting for Orpen, whose portrait of him was used as the cover illustration of the next edition of &quot;War Pictorial&quot; magazine and widely reproduced elsewhere after that.

====&quot;The Refugee&quot;====

Late in 1917, Orpen spent two weeks in hospital with blood poisoning. There he met a young volunteer Red Cross worker from Lille named Yvonne Aubicq. The two began a relationship that was to last ten years and Orpen painted several portraits of her. Two of these he submitted to the official censor early in 1918. Orpen named both paintings &quot;A Spy&quot; and in March 1918 was interviewed by A. N. Lee the military censor responsible for the war artists. Lee made it clear that if the title was intended as a joke it was in very bad taste coming so soon after the execution of Mata Hari but if the subject really was a spy then Orpen could be facing a court-martial. Orpen gave Lee a fantastical story that the woman in the picture was a German spy who had been executed by the French but who, in an attempt to save herself, had at the last moment revealed herself naked in front of the firing squad. Lee had Orpen recalled to London to be reprimanded at the War Office. There, Orpen retracted the firing squad story but was ordered to remain in London. Orpen ignored this and, quite illegally, made his way back to France. There he contrived to receive a phone call from Haig&#x27;s private office, within earshot of several of Lee&#x27;s colleagues from Army Intelligence, inviting him to dinner with Haig to discuss what he would like to paint next. Lee dropped his objections to Orpen working in France, and Orpen agreed to rename the two pictures &quot;The Refugee&quot;.

As the war progressed, Orpen and Lee became good friends; Orpen painted two portraits of him, and they went drinking together in London and maintained a lively correspondence until Orpen&#x27;s death. It is not clear how well known this friendship was during their lives but if it was known of in Dublin it would have caused consternation and real pain in several quarters. Not only had Lee been the brigade major sent to Dublin to put down the 1916 Easter Rising, but had been the officer in charge of arranging several of the executions that followed the fighting, including that of Joseph Plunkett, the husband of Grace Gifford, Orpen&#x27;s star pupil from his teaching days. In fact, between enlisting in the British Army in 1915 and his death in 1931, Orpen spent only a single day, in 1918, in Ireland.

In May 2010, a third version of &quot;The Refugee&quot; surfaced on the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; television programme. The Imperial War Museum had assured its owner that it was a copy by someone other than Orpen, but the programme&#x27;s art expert, Rupert Maas, determined it was painted by Orpen himself as a &#x27;thank-you&#x27; present to Lord Beaverbrook for helping him avoid being court-martialled in March 1918. The picture was estimated to be worth £250,000.
====Recognition====

In May 1918, 125 of Orpen&#x27;s war paintings and drawings were displayed at Agnew&#x27;s Gallery in Old Bond Street in London. The exhibition was a great success with 9000 paying visitors in its four weeks. Highlights of the exhibition included nine of Orpen&#x27;s &#x27;khaki portraits&#x27; and several of his works from the Somme such as &quot;Highlander Passing a Grave&quot; and &quot;Thinker on the Butte de Warlencourt&quot;. There was much press discussion as to why the censor had passed Orpen&#x27;s &quot;Dead Germans in a Trench&quot; as suitable for display, after his refusal to allow Christopher Nevinson&#x27;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; to be displayed two months previously. In fact Arthur Lee had refused to pass nearly all of the paintings shown at Agnew&#x27;s but Orpen appealed to the Director of Military Intelligence, General George Macdonogh, and had him overruled. After Agnew&#x27;s, several museums and galleries wanted to host the exhibition and it was taken to the Manchester City Art Gallery and then the United States. Whilst the exhibition was in London, it was announced that Orpen was donating all the works on display to the British government on the understanding that they should remain in their white frames and be kept together as a single body of work. They are now in the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London. In the King&#x27;s 1918 Birthday Honours list that summer he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

====1918====

Orpen returned to France in July and spent a second summer painting on the old Somme battlefield and making frequent trips to Paris to complete a series of portraits of Canadian commanders. Later he painted the immediate aftermath of the fighting at Zonnebeke that had taken place during the Fifth Battle of Ypres. Orpen made it clear he wished to remain in France and was keen to work in the newly liberated towns. By the end of the summer of 1918, Orpen was mentally exhausted and his works became increasingly theatrical, less realistic and more allegorical. In &quot;Harvest&quot; (1918), which shows women tending a grave covered in barbed wire, he used a garish palette of colours to emphasize the unreal nature of the scene. While &quot;Bombing: Night&quot; and &quot;Adam and Eve at Peronne&quot; seem somewhat flawed compositions, other paintings were far more successful. Most notably, &quot;The Mad Woman of Douai&quot; is a harrowing depiction of the aftermath of a rape. When Orpen met the woman some time afterwards she was &#x27;silent and motionless, except for one thumb which constantly twitched&#x27;. The two soldiers in the picture are both figures borrowed from other paintings of his, as is the grave in the foreground. Orpen had been shocked to see a number of such burial mounds with, as he wrote, &quot;arms and feet showing in lots of cases&quot;.

As the war entered its final stages Orpen witnessed scenes which he found increasingly macabre. One day, even the broad-minded Orpen was shocked to encounter three young French prostitutes offering their services next to a burial party at a gravesite. Towards the end of the war, he painted a handful of &#x27;parable paintings&#x27;, such as &quot;Armistice Night, Amiens&quot; and &quot;The Official Entry of the Kaiser&quot;, that used black humour to re-imagine the coming victory. Most of these paintings were never displayed in public after the war. In November 1918, Orpen collapsed and became seriously ill. Yvonne Aubicq spent two months nursing him before he moved to Paris in January 1919 to begin work on his next commission.

===The Peace Conference===

When the war ended, the Imperial War Museum commissioned Orpen to stay in France and paint three large group portraits of the delegates to Paris Peace Conference. Throughout 1919 he painted individual portraits of the delegates to the Conference and these formed the basis of his two large paintings, &quot;A Peace Conference at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&quot; and &quot;The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors&quot;. In both pictures, the architecture overwhelms the gathered politicians and statesmen whose political wranglings and vainglory had diminished them in Orpen&#x27;s eyes.

Orpen considered that the whole conference was being conducted with a lack of respect or regard for the suffering of the soldiers who fought in the war, and he attempted to address this in the third painting of the commission. This picture was to show the delegates and military leaders as they entered the Hall of Mirrors to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Orpen sent Evelyn Saint-George a letter detailing the original layout and composition of the work. Haig and Marshal Foch were at the centre with the other delegates on either side of them. Among the delegates, Orpen included two additional figures, a Grenadier Guards sergeant and Arthur Rhys-Davids, the young fighter pilot he had painted the week before he was killed in 1917. After working on this composition for nine months, Orpen painted over all the figures and replaced them with a coffin covered by the Union Jack and flanked by a pair of ghostly and wretched soldiers clothed in rags, actually the figure from the painting &quot;Blown Up, Mad&quot;, with two cherubs above them supporting garlands of flowers. This painting, now known as &quot;To the Unknown British Soldier in France&quot;, was first exhibited in 1923 at the Royal Academy. The public voted it picture of the year, but almost all of the critics who reviewed the picture condemned it; and, from a handful of critics and newspapers, Orpen received sustained abuse and was accused of bad taste, technical ineptitude and, for the two figures either side of the coffin, sacrilege. Orpen did receive some letters of appreciation from ex-servicemen and from family members of soldiers who had died in the war, but he still felt the need to issue a statement explaining the picture and his intentions. However, it was clearly not the group portrait the Imperial War Museum had commissioned, and the Museum refused to accept it. The picture remained in Orpen&#x27;s studio until 1928 when, on his own initiative, he offered to paint out the cherubs and the soldiers if that would make it acceptable to the Museum. The then Director of the IWM replied that he would be happy to accept the picture as it was, or however Orpen wished to present it. Orpen painted out the soldiers and the painting was accepted by the Museum in 1928.

===Later life===
After the war, Orpen returned to painting society portraits and enjoyed great commercial success. He was never short of portrait commissions to work on and throughout the 1920s often earned £35,000 per year and could easily charge 2,000 guineas for a picture. Throughout the 1920s he exhibited at the Royal Academy each year and maintained homes and studios in both London and Paris, where he lived with Aubicq. 

Orpen continued to drink heavily and although he was separated from his wife, they never divorced. Eventually, he and Aubicq separated and she later married William Grover-Williams, Orpen&#x27;s former chauffeur. His 1921 Royal Academy submission was a portrait of the head chef at the Hotel Chatham in Paris. The Tate Gallery were keen to acquire the painting using funds from the Chantrey Bequest. After Orpen assured the Tate that the picture met the conditions required by the Bequest and that he had painted the picture entirely in Britain, the Tate announced the purchase. Several people then came forward to say that they had seen Orpen paint the picture in Paris. Orpen withdrew from the purchase and gave the Tate a portrait of Sir William Symington McCormick instead. Orpen subsequently submitted &quot;Le Chef de l&#x27;Hotel Chatham, Paris&quot; to the Royal Academy as his diploma painting.
Orpen&#x27;s wartime memoir, &quot;An Onlooker in France, 1917–1919&quot;, was published in 1921 and all the proceeds donated to war charities. In 1925, Orpen painted &quot;Sunlight&quot;, a brilliant depiction, in dappled sunlight, of a nude woman on a bed, behind whom hangs &quot;The Seine at Marly&quot;, the 1874 painting by Monet which Orpen owned. In 1922, Orpen was reported to be receiving treatment in London for &#x27;tobacco poisoning&#x27;. In 1923 Arthur Lee introduced Orpen to Edward, the Prince of Wales, and secured Orpen a commission to paint the Prince for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. A long series of disagreements followed between the Prince&#x27;s advisors, who wanted a formal portrait, and Orpen, who wanted to paint Edward in his golf clothes. Orpen got his way but it was not until 1928 that the R&amp;A put the painting on display. In 1927, Orpen accepted a commission to paint a portrait of David Lloyd George but the completed work was rejected as being too informal for such a senior politician. The painting remained with Orpen and was only purchased by the National Portrait Gallery after his death. In 1928 Orpen stood for election as President of the Royal Academy but lost to Sir William Llewellyn. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

===Death===
Orpen became seriously ill in May 1931, and, after suffering periods of memory loss, died aged 52 in London, on 29 September 1931, and was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. A stone tablet in the Island of Ireland Peace Park Memorial at Messines, Belgium, commemorates him.

==Self-portraits==
Orpen created many self-portraits during his lifetime. He often portrayed himself in the act of painting and often created multiple images of himself. Whilst at the Slade he painted a double portrait of himself and Augustus John in the Nell Gwynne Tavern in London. In 1913 Orpen painted himself with a golden version of his painting &quot;Sowing New Seed&quot; as a background. &quot;Self-portrait as Chardin&quot;, from 1908, shows Orpen as the painter Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin at an easel painting the same image. A year earlier he had painted a head-and-shoulders self-portrait after Chardin&#x27;s 1776 work &quot;Self-Portrait with Pince-nez&quot;.

Orpen&#x27;s 1910 self-portrait &quot;Leading the Life in the West&quot; has been read as a reference to the 1907 play &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, by John Millington Synge, whom Orpen knew and greatly liked. During World War I, Orpen painted at least three self-portraits, that ranged from the optimistic tones of &quot;Ready to Start&quot;, in June 1917, to more sombre depictions painted only a few months later. Bruce Arnold noted Orpen&#x27;s interest in self-portraiture: his self-portraits are often searching and dramatic and seem to meet a deep personal need for frequent self-analysis. He once painted himself as a jockey, and in his &quot;The Dead Ptarmigan – a self-portrait&quot; in the National Gallery of Ireland he scowls from the frame while holding a dead ptarmigan at head height. Orpen&#x27;s later self-portraits were less successful. Writing in 2005, Kenneth McConkey attributed the shallowness of Orpen&#x27;s later portraits to emotional exhaustion, resulting from his experience as a painter of war. He wrote of Orpen&#x27;s post-war activity:
:&quot;Now the portraits were done with mechanical efficiency, and without pause for reflection, save when he scrutinised himself and found a face he could no longer understand ... his face... grimaces, it squints, it scowls; in the 1920s it papers over the inner turmoil left by the long pathetic queues of gas-blinded tommies&quot;.

==Legacy==

A memorial exhibition of Orpen&#x27;s work was held in New York in 1932 and the Royal Academy also held a memorial exhibition in 1933, part of which travelled to the Birmingham City Art Gallery. Orpen&#x27;s former friend Augustus John vilified him after his death, and an account in Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s 1937 autobiography of an encounter between the two in Cassel during the war further tarnished Orpen&#x27;s reputation. In 1952 the then Director of the Tate Gallery, John Rothenstein, who was related to Orpen by marriage, published &quot;Modern English Painters&quot; which, despite its title, included a chapter on Orpen that comprehensively criticised every aspect of his work and personality. This had a huge influence, and for many years Orpen was largely forgotten. Other than the collection of his war paintings in the &#x27;Orpen Gallery&#x27; of the Imperial War Museum, only two of Orpen&#x27;s works were regularly on display in Britain, &quot;The Mirror&quot; in the Tate and &quot;A Woman&quot; in Leeds City Art Gallery. A major retrospective of his work was held at the National Gallery of Ireland in 1978 but was not shown in Britain. Bruce Arnold&#x27;s 1981 biography revived interest in Orpen among scholars, and in 2005 a major retrospective which also included his peacetime work was held at the Imperial War Museum, and led to a reappraisal of his place in British and Irish culture.

Bruce Arnold, writing in &quot;Irish Art a Concise History&quot; in 1969 stated:... while at times his portraits are rather shallow, he was capable of excellent and sympathetic work, particularly in family and group portraits.
As noted by his biographer, H. L. Wellington,Orpen was fond of painting women sitters against a black background, lighting the figure from two sides, an arrangement which gave luminosity and a certain ethereal appearance to his unfaltering but matter-of-fact statement…

<text>The Victoria Falls Bridge crosses the Zambezi River just below the Victoria Falls and is built over the Second Gorge of the falls. As the river forms the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, the bridge links the two countries and has border posts on the approaches to both ends, at the towns of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, and Livingstone, Zambia.

==History==
The bridge was the brainchild of Cecil Rhodes, part of his grand and unfulfilled Cape to Cairo railway scheme, even though he never visited the falls and died before construction of the bridge began. Rhodes is recorded as instructing the engineers to &quot;build the bridge across the Zambezi where the trains, as they pass, will catch the spray of the Falls&quot;. It was designed by George Andrew Hobson of consultants Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, assisted by the stress calculations of Ralph Freeman, who was later the principal designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The main central arch is a parabolic curve.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://bestbridge.net/Africa_en/victoria-falls-bridge.html&quot;&gt;Best Bridge Africa Victoria Falls Bridge: para, accessdate: 2 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge was prefabricated in Darlington, England by the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company, before being shipped to the port city of Beira in Portuguese-ruled Mozambique, and then transported on the newly constructed railway to the Victoria Falls. It took just 14 months to construct and was completed in 1905.

The bridge was officially opened by Professor Sir George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin and President of the British Association (now the British Science Association), on 12 September 1905. The American Society of Civil Engineers has designated the bridge as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.


Constructed from steel, the bridge is long, with a main arch spanning , at a height of above the lower water mark of the river in the gorge below. It carries a road, railway and footway. The bridge is the only rail link between Zambia and Zimbabwe and one of only three road links between the two countries.

The Victoria Falls Bridge did not bring the first train or the first railway to Northern Rhodesia (called Zambia since 1964). To push on with construction of the railway north as fast as possible, Cecil Rhodes insisted that the Livingstone to Kalomo line be laid before the bridge was finished. Then a locomotive was conveyed in pieces across the gorge by the temporary electric cableway used for the transportation of the bridge materials and nicknamed the &#x27;Blondin&#x27; by the construction engineers. The locomotive was re-assembled and entered service months before the bridge was complete.

For more than 50 years, the bridge was crossed regularly by passenger trains as part of the principal route between the then Northern Rhodesia, southern Africa and Europe. Freight trains carried mainly copper ore (later, copper ingots) and timber out of Northern Rhodesia, and coal into the country.

The age of the bridge and maintenance problems have led to traffic restrictions at times. Trains cross at less than walking pace and trucks were limited to 30 t, necessitating heavier trucks making a long diversion via the Kazungula Ferry or Chirundu Bridge. The limit was raised after repairs in 2006, but proposals for more fundamental rehabilitation or construction of a new bridge have been aired.

The toll on the bridge was abolished in 1906.

During the Rhodesian UDI crisis and Bush War, the bridge was frequently closed (and regular passenger services have not resumed successfully). In 1975, the bridge was the site of unsuccessful peace talks when the parties met in a train carriage poised above the gorge for nine and a half hours. In 1980, freight and road services resumed and have continued without interruption except for maintenance.

Today, one of the Victoria Falls Bridge&#x27;s main attraction are historical guided tours focusing on the construction of the bridge and include a walking tour under the main deck. On the Zambian side there is a small museum about the bridge which is free to enter and contains a café selling refreshments. Also located on the bridge is the Shearwater bungee jump including a bungee swing and zip-line. Concerns about safety of the attraction were raised in late 2011 after the bungee&#x27;s cord snapped and a young Australian woman fell into the fast-flowing river (she survived).

The bridge was originally referred to as the Great Zambesi or Zambezi Bridge, later becoming known as the Victoria Falls Bridge.

<text>The Lehigh Line Connection connects Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor (NEC) with the Conrail Lehigh Line south of downtown Newark, New Jersey. It leaves the NEC at Hunter Interlocking, and the line is sometimes called the Hunter Connection. Used by New Jersey Transit (NJT) Raritan Valley Line trains since 1997 when it replaced an older connection, it splits from the NEC just north of the former connector, with wider radius curves with a maximum speed of 45 mph, compared to the 15 mph of the original alignment. 

The old connection had a single track with older overhead wire and Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) signaling. Until 1961 Lehigh Valley Railroad (LV) passenger trains bound to/from New York Penn Station, such as the &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, used the connection to reach their own railroad from the PRR main line. At the top of the hill at NK interlocking, LV diesels exchanged the train(s) with PRR electric locomotives. Despite the lack of electrification on the line past the connection, the new trackage is also equipped with catenary wire.

Amtrak and NJT have proposed constructing the Hunter Flyover, which would carry Newark-bound Raritan Valley Line trains up and over the six-track NEC main line. Currently, Raritan Valley trains heading toward Newark have to cross three or four tracks at grade to access the eastbound tracks at Newark. This flyover would remove many directional conflicts between trains and reduce delays on the NEC. The project would cost $250 million and is currently undergoing environmental analysis.

<doc id="1303430" wikidata="Q1678003" url="?curid=1303430" title="Jacques Grévin">
<text>Jacques Grévin (; – 5 November 1570) was a French playwright.

Grévin was born at Clermont, Oise in about 1539, and he studied medicine at the University of Paris. He became a disciple of Ronsard, and was one of the band of dramatists who sought to introduce the classical drama in France. As Sainte-Beuve points out, the comedies of Grévin show considerable affinity with the farces and that preceded them. His first play, &quot;La Maubertine&quot; was lost, and formed the basis of a new comedy, &quot;La Trésorière&quot;, first performed at the college of Beauvais in 1558, though it had been originally composed at the desire of Henry II to celebrate the marriage of Claude, duchess of Lorraine.

He got engaged to the writer Nicole Estienne and he celebrated her in his collection &quot;L&#x27;Olimpe&quot;. The engagement was broken for unknown reasons.

In 1560 followed the tragedy of &quot;Jules César&quot;, imitated from the Latin of Muret, and a comedy, &quot;Les Ébahis&quot;, the most important but also the most indecent of his works. Grévin was also the author of some medical works and of miscellaneous poems, which were praised by Ronsard until the friends were separated by religious differences. Grévin became in 1561 physician and counsellor to Margaret of Savoy, and died at her court in Turin in 1570.

&quot;Le Théâtre de Jacques Grévin&quot; was printed in 1562, and in the &quot;Ancien Théâtre français&quot;, vol. iv. (1855–1856). See L Pinvert, &quot;Jacques Grévin&quot; (1899).

<text>Jeri Janet Ellsworth (born August 14, 1974) is an American entrepreneur, computer chip designer and inventor. She gained fame in 2004 for creating a complete Commodore 64 emulator system on a chip housed within a joystick, called Commodore 30-in-1 Direct to TV. It runs 30 video games from the 1980s, and at peak, sold over 70,000 units in a single day via the QVC shopping channel.

Ellsworth was hired by Valve Corporation to develop augmented reality hardware, but was terminated in 2013. She co-founded castAR to continue the work—with permission—but the company shut down on June 26, 2017 without completing development. She started another company, Tilt Five, to create AR hardware based on the same principles.

Ellsworth has publicly talked about various homebrew projects, such as how to manufacture semiconductor chips at home.

== Early life ==
Ellsworth was born in Georgia and grew up in the towns of Dallas, Oregon and Yamhill, Oregon. Her mother died when she was one. Ellsworth was raised by her father, Jim, a car mechanic and Mobil service station owner.

When she was eight years old, she disassembled her toys to learn how they worked. In response her father stopped buying toys, put an empty box at his work saying &quot;bring your broken electronic gizmos&quot;, and every few weeks, gave them to her. She started making simple modifications to them. She persuaded her father to let her use a Commodore 64 computer which had been purchased for her brother. She taught herself to program by reading the manual. She earned spending money working for her father, pumping gas, cleaning wrenches, replacing oil filters, and other &quot;mechanical things&quot;.

In high school, she drove dirt track racing cars with her father and began designing new models in his workshop, eventually selling custom race cars. She dropped out of high school to continue the business.

== Computer stores ==
In 1995, at the age of 21, Ellsworth tired of race track social atmosphere, so she and a friend started a business assembling and selling computers based around the Intel 486 microprocessor. When she and her partner had a disagreement, Ellsworth opened a separate business in competition. This became a chain of four stores, &quot;Computers Made Easy&quot;, selling consumer electronics services and equipment in the Willamette Valley towns of Canby, Monmouth, and Albany, Oregon.

When profit margins shrank, she sold the chain in 2000 and moved to Walla Walla, Washington to attend Walla Walla College, studying circuit design. She left after a year because of a &quot;cultural mismatch&quot;. Ellsworth said that questioning professors&#x27; answers was frowned upon.

== Hardware design ==
In 2000, Ellsworth unveiled a prototype video expansion for the Commodore 64 at a Commodore Exposition. Ellsworth then began designing digital circuits that mimicked the behavior of the C64. In 2002, she designed the chip used in the C-One as an enhanced C64 which could also emulate other home computers of the early 1980s, including the VIC-20 and ZX81. She and a fellow developer displayed the C-One at a technology conference, which led to Mammoth Toys, a Division of NSI International, NSI Products (HK) Limited hiring her to design the &quot;computer in a chip&quot; for the C64 Direct-to-TV C64-emulating joystick. She began the project in June 2004 and had the project ready to ship by that Christmas. It sold over a half-million units, in the US, Europe, and elsewhere. She did not receive payment, nor the commission she was owed, but a story in the &quot;New York Times&quot; brought her to the public eye.

On December 3, 2010 Ellsworth released information on how to build a TSA &quot;naked&quot; scanner using repurposed satellite antenna parts. Ellsworth has worked on numerous subjects as diverse as homemade semiconductors (2009), homemade electroluminescent (EL) displays (2010), EL phosphor manufacture from common ingredients and ways to make transparent EL backplanes and phosphor without using expensive indium-tin-oxide coated glass and hard-to-obtain chemicals.

Ellsworth was named &quot;MacGyver of the Day&quot; on February 25, 2010 by &quot;Lifehacker&quot;.

Ellsworth is a freelance ASIC and FPGA designer.

==Augmented reality==
In early 2012, Ellsworth and other hardware hackers were hired by Valve to work on gaming hardware. Along with several other Valve employees, Ellsworth was terminated the following year.

On May 18, 2013, Ellsworth announced that she had developed an augmented reality development system named castAR with fellow ex-Valve engineer Rick Johnson, with the blessing of Valve&#x27;s Gabe Newell, and would be funding it via Kickstarter later in the year. Her start-up company, Technical Illusions, started developing castAR.

Ellsworth later revealed she had been secretly working to make castAR have &quot;true VR and true AR&quot; in addition to the previously announced projected AR capabilities. The castAR Kickstarter, launched on October 14, 2013, reached its goal of $400,000 in 56 hours and finished with $1.05 million, 263% of the original goal. The project didn&#x27;t deliver the devices and paid back the funds to backers before shutting down the company in 2017.

In September 2019, Ellsworth initiated a Kickstarter for a new device based on the same principles of the castAR, called Tilt Five. This Kickstarter exceeded the previous one, hitting its initial target of $450,000 in 17 hours, and eventually gaining $1,767,301. Initially scheduled to deliver Kickstarter product by June 2020, the manufacturing was delayed by the Covid pandemic, but has continued to sign gaming contracts.

==Public speaking and webcasts==
Ellsworth was a keynote speaker at the Embedded Systems Conference on May 5, 2011.

From December 2008 until March 2009, Ellsworth hosted a weekly webcast, &quot;Fatman and Circuit Girl&quot;, together with musician George Sanger. On May 30, 2009, Ellsworth demonstrated her Home Chip Lab at Maker Faire Bay Area 2009.

==Personal life==
Ellsworth is a pinball aficionado and owns over 80 pinball machines. In 2016, she became a licensed amateur radio operator, holding an Extra Class license with callsign AI6TK.

<text>The Selle Français (SF) is a breed of sport horse from France. An athletic horse with good gaits, it is usually bay or chestnut in color. The Selle Français was created in 1958 when several French riding horse breeds were merged into one stud book. The new breed was meant to serve as a unified sport horse during a period when horses were being replaced by mechanization and were transforming into an animal used mainly for sport and leisure.

Bred throughout France, the Selle Français has been exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses registered with the stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, may be used for breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français. 

Selle Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Breed characteristics==
Because of the diversity of the breeds that contributed to the Selle Français, there are not set breed standards. It can range from , although, because they are used as sport horses, most Selle Français usually stand a relatively tall . It is an athletic horse with balanced, harmonious and powerful gaits. Some morphological traits remain the same throughout the breed. The forehead is broad, and the facial profile is straight or convex. The neck is strong and rather long, well connected to the withers, and the back straight. The croup is elongated, muscular and slightly oblique, and the powerful hindquarters are an asset in show jumping. The chest is deep, and the shoulders long and sloping. The legs are strong and muscular with wide joints and hard hooves.

The Selle Français is generally bay or chestnut in color, the latter being a legacy of its origins in the Anglo-Norman and Limousin breeds. Gray is much less common, with its origins in the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arabian horses that contributed to the breed. White markings, such as white on the lower legs, are fairly common within the breed, and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors. The temperament of the Selle Français is highly variable from one horse to another. This is due to the selection criteria for breeding stock, which since the beginning of the breed have been based on physical ability. In recent years, however, the ANSF and breeders have been working to create selection criteria that focus on temperament. The vast majority of Selle Français have good temperaments, quiet but energetic, patient and friendly. The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn.

==History==

The origins of the Selle Français begin with native French horses. In 19th century Normandy, native mares were crossbred with Thoroughbred or Norfolk Trotter stallions imported to France from the United Kingdom. At least one Cleveland Bay mare was also recorded in early Selle Français pedigrees, with French-born Thoroughbred and Cleveland Bay cross mares, or Yorkshire Coach Horses, being used as foundation stock. The most common crosses were between native mares used by the military, or those bred for pulling carriages, and Thoroughbred stallions. In 1914 these types were recognized as &quot;demi-sang&quot; or &quot;half-blood&quot; horses. Half-blood horses were found in many French regions, and different types were usually named after the regions in which they were bred. The three main types of French saddle horses by the mid-20th century were the Anglo-Norman (bred around Caen), the &quot;demi-sang du Centre&quot; (bred around Cluny) and the Vendéen (bred around La Roche-sur-Yon).

In 1958, &quot;Selle Français&quot; or French Saddle Horse, was created by merging all of the regional half-blood horses in France under one name. The merged types included the Anglo-Norman, the Charolais (from the Charolles region), the Limousin (from the Limousin region), and the Vendéen. The merger was done to create a sport horse that would meet the needs of a post-World War II mechanized society where horses were used by both the French military and civilians for leisure and sport. The first Selle Français were not homogeneous in type, but offered a wide genetic diversity, due to the wide variety of local horses crossed with Thoroughbreds, Anglo-Arabians, and French Trotters. Norman origins, however, were the most widely represented, as the Anglo-Norman had been used for breeding throughout France.

Since its creation as a breed, the Selle Français has been selected solely as a sport horse. Because of this, the breed has homogenized and refined, and since its creation has been a successful competitor in international equestrian sport. In July 2003, the &quot;Association nationale du selle français&quot; (ANSF or National Association of French Saddle Horses) was approved as the breed association. The ANSF plays an advocacy role with stakeholders and partners in the equine world and ensures a proper orientation of selection and genetic improvement within the breed. Breeding of Selle Français is centered in Normandy, mainly due to its origins in Norman-related bloodlines. As of 2009, there were 7,722 farms that reported breeding activity of Selle Français, although the vast majority (around 77 percent) were very small operations with only one mare. In 2008, there were 7,638 Selle Français foals born, which made up 57 percent of the total saddle horses bred in France. In 2009, over 13,500 Selle Français mares were bred, of which 11,830 were mated to approved stallions to produce Selle Français offspring. In the same year, there were 505 active Selle Français stallions.

The Selle Français is bred throughout France and abroad, and artificial insemination plays an important role in the dissemination of the breed. The Selle Français has also contributed to several other breeds in Europe, including the Holsteiner, Zangersheide, and Oldenburger warmblood breeds. The ANSF has branches in several countries. The United Kingdom organization, called Equicours, led to the opening of a British stud book for the Selle Français, and the ANSF-US manages the stud book for the breed in the United States. Brazil, Argentina, and Morocco have agreements with the French stud book to register horses bred in those countries.

==Registration and stud book selection==

The Selle Français stud book has long allowed crossbreeding with four other breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from a cross between a Selle Français and a &quot;facteur de selle français&quot; (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.

Mares can be of several origins and be listed as &quot;facteur de selle français&quot;. Thoroughbred, AQPS, pure or crossbred Anglo-Arabians and French Trotting horses may also qualify under this designation, as do mares that are the product of two &quot;facteur de selle français&quot; horses. Mares belonging to other saddle horse breeds recognized by the European Union (EU) are also listed in this category. Pure and crossbred Arabians, saddle breeds not recognized by the EU and some other mares may be listed on an individual basis by performing at a high level in show jumping, three-day eventing or dressage competition. If mares come from countries or territories that do not have access to high-level competitions, they may be granted special listing status.

In 2003, the stud book was divided into two parts: a section for pure Selle Français from two registered parents and a section for horses with one &quot;facteur de selle français&quot; parent. In 2009, this distinction was abandoned and the two sections were recombined into a single stud book.

==Uses==

The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now recognized internationally as a top breed for show jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed to be successful in all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.
The &quot;Institut français du cheval et de l&#x27;équitation&quot; (French Institute of Horse Riding), the &quot;École nationale d&#x27;équitation&quot; (National Equestrian School) and the Cadre Noir all use mainly Selle Français. Young horses are selected according to their skills and are trained by students within the schools. Horses representing the Cadre Noir are selected at the age of three and are trained according to their abilities, with some reaching the highest levels of &quot;haute ecole&quot; dressage. Selle Français are also used for combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding, and have competed at the international level in all three sports.

Selle Français are also used for the production of race horses in France. By crossbreeding them with Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arabians, horses are produced which are competitive in steeplechase (racing over obstacles). These horses are generally registered as AQPS (meaning &quot;other than Thoroughbred&quot;) in France. The AQPS studbook in France was created in 2005; before this, some successful French racehorses, especially those raced in steeplechase races, were registered as Selle Français. These include Neptune Collonges, winner of the 2012 Grand National race, and Quevega.

==International success==
Many Selle Français compete each year in international competitions in many equestrian disciplines. Some have been particularly successful:

Almé Z (1966–1991), while not a successful international competitor himself, was a sire of huge importance to the international show jumping world. Among his numerous successful progeny were I Love You (a World Cup winner) and Galoubet A (1972–2005), part of the gold-medal winning French show-jumping team at the World Championships in 1982. Galoubet A, in turn, is known for both his competition career and the success of his offspring. He is the sire of Baloubet du Rouet (b. 1989), who with rider Rodrigo Pessoa won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and was a three-time winner of the World Cup.

Flambeau C (b. 1971) became a pillar of the French show jumping team in the 1980s. He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he took 7th individually, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal with the French team. The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991). A small black horse with a conformation and gaits that were considered disadvantageous for show jumping, Jappeloup was an unusual cross between a Throughbred mare and a French Trotter sire, and was registered as Selle Français. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.

In the 1990s, several Selle Français rose to prominence in international competition. Quidam de Revel (b. 1982), was on the French bronze medal winning show jumping team at the 1992 Summer Olympics, ridden by Hervé Godignon, and Quito de Baussy (b. 1982) was a European champion, world champion and another member of the French team in 1992, ridden by Éric Navet. Rochet Rouge (1983–2008) was a show jumping European champion in 1999 and an individual bronze medalist at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The 2000s saw Selle Français among the world leaders in both show jumping and three-day eventing. Four stallions made up the champion show jumping team at the 2002 World Equestrian Games, while four more Selle Francais made up the winning three-day event team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2003, a Selle Francais became the European champion in vaulting, and another was named the world champion in competitive trail riding.

The Selle Français continued to lead international show jumping competitions in the 2010s, with Swiss rider Steve Guerdat riding a member of the breed, Nino des Buissonets, to individual gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics. More recently, Totem de Brecey (b. 2007) placed fourth in the 2019 Continental/Regional Championships Luhmühlen and was ridden by French rider Christopher Six at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.

<text>Koxbox is a Danish musical group formed in 1990 that produced psychedelic trance. It consisted of Peter Candy and Frank É Madsen. Ian Ion, their studio producer, is also sometimes mentioned as part of the group.

== History ==
After publishing a few singles, the group was discovered by DJ Sven Väth, and soon, they published their first album &quot;Forever After&quot; (under his record label Harthouse). The group later produced another two albums: &quot;Dragon Tales&quot;, and &quot;The Great Unknown&quot;. In 1998, Peter Candy left the Koxbox.

This marked the end of the original Koxbox lineup, but Frank É Madsen and Ian Ion continued to produce. Already in 1997, they had renamed their own musical group Psychopod to Saiko-Pod, adopting a somewhat different style (perhaps best described as slower and funkier). In 2006, six years after the release of The Great Unknown, Koxbox returned with &quot;U-Turn&quot;, released on Twisted Records. This most recent album contained collaborations with some of psychedelic dance music&#x27;s best established artists including Joie Hinton and Merv Pepler (Eat Static, Ozric Tentacles), Frederic Holyszewski (Deedrah, Dado, Cypher, Transwave) and Serge Souque (Total Eclipse) as well as others.

== Music ==
The Koxbox gained considerable popularity within the psytrance scene. Their work was of exceptional quality and differentiated them from most groups of the time. They used innovative sounds that make the Koxbox music characteristic to trained ears. They had a preference for rich, melodic tunes, and this was much appreciated at a time when the Goa subgenre was the most popular psytrance style.

They have remixed tracks by Juno Reactor and Slinky Wizard.

Their tracks &quot;Fuel On&quot;, &quot;Ambivalentino&quot;, and &quot;Midnight Till The End&quot; appear in the Danish movie &quot;Pusher&quot;. The latter track was produced especially to be used in the movie.

There exists a video clip for the track &quot;Life is...&quot;, but nobody knows how to obtain it. A truncated (2 minutes, 33 seconds long) lo-fi RealMedia version of the clip was available for free download at the Blue Room Released website, under the band&#x27;s section. The domain blueroom.co.uk is now owned by the &quot;M.E.L.T&quot; record label and the old &quot;Blue Room&quot; pages, along with the clip, are unavailable. However, this rare file is still circulated on file sharing networks.

<text>George Bellas Greenough FRS FGS (18 January 1778 – 2 April 1855) was a pioneering English geologist. He is best known as a synthesizer of geology rather than as an original researcher. 
Trained as a lawyer, he was a talented speaker and his annual addresses as founding president of the Geological Society of London were influential in identifying and guiding contemporary geological research. He also courted controversy, after using his presidential address in 1834 to cast aspersions on a paper on great earthquakes by Maria Graham. Greenough advocated an empirical approach to the early science; his scepticism of theoretical thinking courted controversy amongst some contemporaries, especially his doubts of the usefulness of fossils in correlating strata. He compiled a geological map of England and Wales, published in 1820, and in the penultimate year of his life used similar methods to produce the first geological map of British India. Greenough characterised himself as follows:
ʻbright eyes, silver hair, large mouth, ears and feet; fondness for generalisation, for system and clearliness; great diligence, patience and zeal; goodnature but hasty; firmness of principle;
hand for gardening.ʼ

==Early life==
Greenough was born in London, as George Bellas, named after his father, George Bellas, who had a profitable business in the legal profession as a proctor in Doctor&#x27;s Commons, St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard Doctors&#x27; Commons and some real estate in Surrey. His mother was the only daughter of the apothecary Thomas Greenough, whose very successful business was located on Ludgate Hill near to St Paul&#x27;s. A younger brother died in infancy.

At the age of six he was orphaned with his father dying first, and the cause, recorded by Greenough in a biographical sketch, was &#x27;By neglect of business, by carelessness, extravagance, dissipation and by party zeal, my father&#x27;s fortune was soon squandered away—family dissention followed; his constitution was broken, his prospects blighted and he died of decline at Clifton in 1784&#x27;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCL Greenough Papers 24/1&quot;&gt;UCL Greenough Papers 24/1&lt;/ref&gt; His mother followed only a few months later.

He was adopted by his maternal grandfather, who had made a fortune through selling popular preparations, the most popular of which were &quot;Pectoral Lozenge from Balsam of Tolu&quot;, for coughs and colds, and various tinctures for cleaning teeth and gums and curing tooth ache.

His grandfather sent him to Mr Cotton&#x27;s school at Salthill near Slough and then to Eton at the age of ten. He stayed there only one year, suggesting he was perhaps too delicate a child for the robust life at the boarding schools of the day.

In September 1789 he entered Dr Thompson&#x27;s school at Kensington where he studied for the next six years. Whilst he was at school he took the name Greenough at the request of his grandfather.

==Education==
He left school in 1795 and went up to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge to study law for three years, but he did not take a degree.

In September 1798, he went to the University of Göttingen to continue his legal studies, thinking that the lectures would be in Latin, but found instead they were all in German. In order to improve his language skills Greenough attended the lectures of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach on natural history and these inspired a passion for mineralogy and geology. At Göttingen Samuel Coleridge was one of his closer friends. A few years later, Greenough was instrumental in securing a government post for Coleridge during his period in Malta.

In 1799, Greenough made at least two tours of the Harz; one in the Easter vacation with Clement Carlyon and Charles and Frederic Parry; and the other in the late summer with Carlyon and Coleridge. These tours were mainly to collect minerals, but he also studied geological collections in the towns he visited.
In 1801, Greenough returned to England and his interest in geology deepened when he toured England with Carlyon and met Humphry Davy in Penzance. Later he attended Davy&#x27;s lectures at the Royal Institution in London. The following year he travelled to France and Italy and &#x27;noted what I saw of geology on my way&#x27;. He went on a geological tour of Scotland with James Skene in 1805, and of Ireland with Davy in 1806. On the Ireland tour he also made a study of social conditions which aroused a deep interest in political questions.

==Politics==
1807 was a significant year for Greenough as this was the founding year of the Geological Society in which he deployed considerable political skill in its establishment and its subsequent organisation and debates on controversial aspects of the emerging science.

He was elected member of parliament for the (&quot;rotten&quot;) borough of Gatton, continuing to hold this seat until 1812, although Hansard does not record he made any contributions to the House.

During the time he helped to found and forge the Geological Society, Greenough served in the militia in the Light Horse Volunteers of London and Westminster. This was a corps of volunteers, originated by a group of city businessmen, and rather than being paid for their services members had to pay to join and maintain an annual subscription. The unit has an obligation to be called out in support of the civil power when necessary. It was rather different from other regiments in organising itself democratically through a committee. All prospective members had to be proposed by one of the committee and if admitted all served as private soldiers, with officers elected by ballot. Greenough enlisted as a private soldier in 1803, but in 1808 he was elected a commissioned officer with the rank of Lieutenant and he served for the next 11 years. Greenough resigned his commission in 1819 as a matter of principle following the Peterloo massacre in Manchester, which he regarded as an abuse of military power for political ends. He published his resignation letters in The Morning Chronicle and The Times. Clearly, Greenough was a man of conscience.

==Geology==
In 1807 Greenough&#x27;s interest in science in general, and geology in particular, increased : he joined a number of eminent scientific and cultural societies and he was elected fellow of the Royal Society. He also became associated with a group of mineralogists to which Davy referred in a letter to William Pepys, dated 13 November 1807, when he said &#x27;We are forming a little talking Geological Club&#x27;. This club rapidly developed into a learned society devoted to geology and Greenough became the chief founder with others of the Geological Society of London. He was the first chairman of that Society, and in 1811, when it was more regularly constituted, he was the first president. In this capacity he served on two subsequent occasions, and did much to promote the advancement of geology.

In 1819, he published &quot;A Critical Examination of the First Principles of Geology&quot;, a work which was useful mainly in refuting erroneous theories. In the following year, the Geological Society issued his famous &quot;Geological Map of England and Wales&quot;, in six sheets (published 1 May 1820, although the date 1 November 1819 appears on the map). A second edition was issued in 1840 (the date on this map is 1 November 1839) and a third edition was published in 1865. This map was the culmination of a major cooperative project of the early Geological Society, who had established a Committee of Maps in April 1809, led by Greenough. Members of the society out in the provinces of England and Wales submitted details of local rocks and strata which were collated by Greenough, entered in his notebooks and plotted on a topographical map. Greenough was an inductivist in the Baconian tradition, so he eschewed &#x27;theory&#x27; and systematically collected information and details with the aim of discovering the distribution of rocks. Greenough received assistance in the collection of his geological facts chiefly from William Buckland, Reverend W. D. Conybeare, Henry Warburton, and Thomas Webster, and amongst others from Henry Thomas De la Beche, John Farey, the Rev. J. Hailstone, David Mushet, Thomas Biddle and Arthur Aikin.

A first draft of the geological map was presented to the Geological Society as early as 1812, but there was dissatisfaction with the quality of the engraving of the topographical map, resulting in the base map not being ready until 1814. In 1815, William Smith published his famous geological map and when Greenough finally published his map five years later it was clear he was heavily indebted to Smith&#x27;s work in delineating strata (although not acknowledged and thus plagiarized until the 1865 edition); nevertheless Greenough&#x27;s map contained more geological detail and was better cartographically. Smith had relied on a theory about the linear arrangement of strata identified by characteristic fossils to extrapolate from his observations (Smith himself was indebted to John Strachey&#x27;s theory of strata for his ideas), and so was able to map out the distribution of strata across the country. Greenough, on the other hand, did not go by theory, and this aversion was probably one of the factors that delayed the preparation of his map.

It has been claimed that Greenough and the Geological Society failed to work with William Smith in the production of a geological map due to snobbishness, but Rachel Lauden argues that a more compelling reason is that Greenough did not consider that fossils could reveal anything about the nature of rocks. Greenough (incorrectly) considered that fossils had been very overrated in their usefulness, as fossil species were different from modern species, so fossils could not be used to &#x27;theorise&#x27; about or deduce the relative age and the conditions of deposition of the rocks. Indeed, he was suspicious of the concepts of &#x27;stratum&#x27; and &#x27;formation&#x27;, much used by Smith. For this reason Greenough wanted to dissociate himself and the Geological Society map from the man who was using fossils to identify strata. Seemingly, Greenough had intellectual reasons rather than primarily social reasons for not collaborating with Smith. This did not, however, stop Greenough from using Smith&#x27;s map as a source of material for the Geological Society&#x27;s version of the map and there is debate about how much Smith&#x27;s map influenced Greenough. Both maps now hang side by side on the main staircase in the entrance hall of The Geological Society apartments in Burlington House, London. An anonymous 1855 obituarist noted that Greenough&#x27;s geology was based mainly on &quot;mineralogical views&quot; and that his habitual skepticism of new theories made him a &quot;drag&quot; on the progress of geological science.

A common narrative in some recent accounts of William Smith&#x27;s life and his map asserts that rivalry built up between Greenough and Smith. However original sources point to this narrative not being the case and indicate Smith was used by John Farey Sr., another &#x27;practical man&#x27;(i.e. mineral surveyor), to prosecute Farey&#x27;s own grievances against the Geological Society in an article in The Philosophical Magazine by which he both started and fuelled the story that Smith was disrespected and there was ill-feeling towards him by the Geological Society men and Greenough in particular. In the following issue Greenough replied, publicly declaring his view as being non-antagonistic by stating: &quot;Your correspondent considers me, in common with many other persons, actuated by feelings of hostility towards Mr. Smith. Now my feelings towards that gentleman are directly the reverse. I respect him for the important services he has rendered to geology, and I esteem him for the example of dignity, meekness, modesty, and candour, which he continually, though ineffectually, exhibits to his self-appointed champion.&quot;

Another common but misleading narrative in some recent accounts of Smith&#x27;s map has Greenough&#x27;s 1820 map undercutting the price and sales of Smith&#x27;s map, thereby citing Greenough as a primary cause of landing Smith in Debtors&#x27; prison. However, Greenough&#x27;s map could not have contributed to the debts for which Smith was consigned to prison as the Greenough map, although dated 1819 on the map, was not published until May 1820, after Smith&#x27;s incarceration. In fact Smith&#x27;s maps retailed at 5 guineas, which was the same price as that privileged to Geological Society members for purchase of the Greenough 1820 map. However the Greenough map retailed to public at 6 guineas, thereby being a more expensive purchase than Smith&#x27;s map. Also, the number of sales of Smith&#x27;s map appears to have topped those of Greenough&#x27;s map (196 copies sold), although neither map sold well and there are only 15 names in common between Smith&#x27;s subscribers&#x27; list and the list of those who bought the Geological Society&#x27;s map. 
In 1843, he started to prepare a geological map of British India. This was possibly inspired by Roderich Murchison&#x27;s presidential address in which he lamented the lack of a geological map of India. In 1852 Greenough produced a series of maps of Hindustan, mainly hydrographical, defining all the important elements of the ten water basins of the Indian Peninsula (for the Asiatic Society), and in 1854 a large-scale geological map of the whole of British India, published as a &#x27;General Sketch of the Physical and Geological Features of British India. Greenough never visited India but much as he had done for his earlier maps of England and Wales, he compiled his map from scraps of information gathered from many observations of officers in the East India Company who were provided forms to submit. He was assisted in this effort by Colonel William Henry Sykes of the East India Company and sixty copies of the map were purchased by the company for distribution. One of Greenough&#x27;s key strengths was his assiduous ability to collect and collate information for his empirical cause. However, this &#x27;remote&#x27; method of map construction resulted in 53 errors on his India map, some topographical as well as geological and palaeontological, that were listed by a committee led by Thomas Oldham, Director of the Geological Survey of India, in 1856. Nevertheless, Greenough&#x27;s geological map of India was a pioneering effort.

Greenough was an active supporter of many important learned scientific societies existing in the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1831 he was one of the prime movers in establishing the British Association for the Advancement of Science (now the British Science Association). He helped found the Geographical Society of London in 1830 (later to become the Royal Geographical Society), being elected to its first council and serving as president from 1839 to 1841. Greenough was an early advocate for physical geography and the accurate delineation of physical features thereby &quot;endeavouring to give a more scientific character to the proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society&quot;.

Greenough&#x27;s connections and travels with Romantics of the period led to him realizing that artistic representations of physical features were imbued with emotional responses and representation which did not mix well with accuracy. On a trip through Switzerland in 1802 he noted that Mont Blanc is very difficult to reproduce artistically. He wrote: &quot;A list of facts drawn up by a simple cold-blooded mathematician who has travelled through the country with his quadrant in his hand! may be better than a painter&#x27;s sketch.&quot; Nevertheless, the influence of the Romantic poets is evident in his travels as his notebooks show how Greenough also found pleasure in allowing imagination and emotion to colour his response to grand landscapes.

Greenough followed the system of Sir Joseph Banks to have weekly open hours for scientific meetings at his residence (first in Parliament Street and later at Grove House).

==Residence==

In 1822 he built himself a villa in Regent&#x27;s Park, designed by Decimus Burton, which was his home for the remainder of his life. In 1827 this was included in a series of drawings of villas in the park by Thomas H. Shepherd, although the dedication misspells the owner&#x27;s name as &quot;Greenhough&quot;. The house, now known as Grove House and structurally modified in the years since Greenough&#x27;s death, stands on Prince Albert Road, NW1, with its gardens alongside the Regents Canal, which separates the property from the main part of the park.

==Death and legacy==

Greenough travelled on journeys to the continent throughout his life and at the age of 76 he set off for Italy and the East (Constantinople) with a view of connecting the geology of his researches on the geology of India with that of Europe, but he was taken ill en route with oedema (&quot;dropsy&quot;), probably caused by cardiac problems, and died at Naples on 2 April 1855.
He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, North London. The grave lies on the south side of the main east–west path. A marble bust by Sir Richard Westmacott commissioned for one hundred pounds in 1842 is now in the Geological Society of London.

Greenough bequeathed his fossil collection to the Geology Department at University College London (UCL) and his notebooks are in the Greenough Papers collection held at UCL Library. The student geological society at UCL is named after Greenough.

The Greenough River in Western Australia was so-named in 1839 by Captain George Grey, after Greenough sponsored his exploration north of Perth. Successful wheat production in the area helped establish the small town of Greenough.

<doc id="1303452" wikidata="Q963043" url="?curid=1303452" title="Chris Byrd">
<text>Christopher Cornelius Byrd (born August 15, 1970) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2009. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion, having first won the WBO title in 2000 after an upset corner stoppage over then-undefeated Vitali Klitschko. In his first title defense later that year, he lost to Vitali&#x27;s brother Wladimir Klitschko. In 2002, Byrd defeated Evander Holyfield to win the IBF heavyweight title for his second reign as world champion. He made four successful defenses until losing his title again to Wladimir Klitschko in a 2006 rematch. He was ranked by BoxRec in the world&#x27;s top 10 heavyweight from 1998 to 2004, reaching his highest ranking of No.3 in 2000.

As an amateur, Byrd represented the United States at the 1992 Summer Olympics and won a silver medal in the middleweight division. He is also a three-time national amateur champion, winning the light middleweight title in 1989, and the middleweight title in 1991 and 1992.

==Early life==
Chris Byrd was the youngest of eight children growing up in Flint, Michigan. He began boxing at age 5, training in his father&#x27;s (Joe Sr.) Joe Byrd Boxing Academy. His father continued to train and manage Byrd as a professional. Byrd attended Flint Northwestern High School.

==Amateur career==
Byrd began competing in the ring at age 10, since then he had 285 amateur fights in various weight classes, compiled an impressive record of 275 wins, 10 losses. He was a three-time U.S. amateur champion (1989, 1991, and 1992). He was on the 1991 U.S. National boxing Team that became the first (and only) U.S. team to score a tie against the heralded Cuban team.
Byrd won the silver medal in the 1992 Barcelona summer Olympics as a middleweight, losing to Cuba&#x27;s Ariel Hernández in the final.

===Amateur highlights===
*Lost in the 1988 Olympic Trials at Light Welterweight, losing to eventual United States representative Todd Foster.
*1989 United States Amateur Light Middleweight Champion
*1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle, lost to Torsten Schmitz (East Germany) on points, in Light Middleweight competition.
*1991 United States Amateur Middleweight Champion
*1991 World Championships, lost at Middlweight to Ramon Garbey (Cuba)
*1992 United States Amateur Middleweight Champion
*1992 Middleweight Gold Medalist at Canada Cup. Results were:
**Justin Crawford (Australia) won on points
**Joe Laryea (Ghana) won on points
**Igor Anashkin (Russia) won on points
*1992 Qualified as a Middleweight at the Olympic Trials in Worcester, MA. Results were:

**Alexander Lebziak (Russia/Unified Team) 16-7
**Ahmed Dine (Algeria) 21-2
**Chris Johnson (Canada) 17-3
**Ariel Hernandez (Cuba) 7-12

==Professional career==

===1993–1998: early career===

Byrd turned professional on January 28, 1993, knocking out 10 of his first 13 opponents. Byrd moved up to heavyweight three fights into his professional career.

Byrd remained undefeated for his first 26 fights, knocking off then-notable opponents like Phil Jackson, Lionel Butler, Uriah Grant, Bert Cooper, Craig Peterson, Frankie Swindell, Jimmy Thunder, undefeated Eliecer Castillo and Ross Puritty.

===1999: Byrd vs. Ibeabuchi, comeback victories===
However, in 1999, Byrd&#x27;s undefeated record came to a dead end when he fought undefeated Ike Ibeabuchi. With 48 seconds left in the fifth round, a left-handed bolo punch followed with a right hook sent Byrd to the canvas, face first.

===2000: first world title, facing the Klitschkos===

During the last week of March 2000, Byrd was offered the chance to be the replacement (for Donovan Ruddock) against undefeated champion Vitali Klitschko in Berlin, Germany (Klitschko&#x27;s adopted home country) for the WBO Heavyweight Title. He therefore had only seven days to prepare for the fight (not the customary 6–12 weeks). Byrd was trailing after nine rounds by scores of 88–83 (on two cards) and 89–82 (on one card), i.e. losing seven or eight of those rounds. However, Byrd was arguably Vitali&#x27;s most difficult opponent as he landed clean shots and made him miss regularly, resulting Klitschko severely injured his shoulder and being unable to continue after the ninth round. The injury that Klitschko suffered was a torn shoulder rotator cuff, which required major surgery and a 7-month lay-off. Despite trailing on all three of the judges&#x27; scorecards, Byrd walked away the winner by a technical knockout due to the injury to Klitschko. While most consider this a fluke win for Byrd, nobody (including Lennox Lewis) gave Vitali a more difficult fight before that and since. Vitali landed at a much lower percentage and while he threw more, Byrd almost landed as many punches as him.

Six months later, Byrd was back in Germany to defend the title against Wladimir Klitschko, Vitali&#x27;s younger, more agile brother. Twelve rounds later, Byrd had lost a lopsided unanimous decision and the WBO belt after being knocked down twice.

===2001–2002: comeback victories, second world title===

Byrd returned to the U.S., signed with Don King and beat Maurice Harris to win the United States Boxing Association heavyweight belt in Madison Square Garden. He was now a top-five contender for the IBF title. After winning his next match (a title defense against New Zealand&#x27;s top contender David Tua) Byrd eventually received his mandatory shot at the vacant IBF world Heavyweight Championship against Evander Holyfield in Atlantic City. On December 14, 2002, Byrd won a unanimous decision and the IBF title.

===2003–2005: four successful title defenses===

Byrd has successfully defended the IBF belt against: Fres Oquendo in 2003, a highly entertaining draw with Andrew Golota and a decision win over friend Jameel McCline in 2004, and DaVarryl Williamson in 2005. Byrd&#x27;s fight with Golota did 75,000 buys on pay-per-view.

===2006: Klitschko rematch===

On April 22, 2006, Byrd faced Wladimir Klitschko for the second time. Byrd was making his fifth defense of his IBF title and the fight was also sanctioned by the International Boxing Organization for its title, which had been vacated upon the retirement of Lennox Lewis. The fight took place at SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany. Byrd was heavily dominated throughout the fight, was down in the fifth, and again in the seventh. Referee Wayne Kelly stopped the fight after the second knockdown when Byrd had an open cut near his eyes. Klitschko won in a TKO.

===2007–2010: Povetkin bout, move to light heavyweight, and retirement===
After losing to Alexander Povetkin, Byrd would drop about 40 pounds to return to the light heavyweight division. He fought Shaun George on May 16, 2008, at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas. Byrd was dropped by George in round one and rocked again in round two. George then hammered Byrd with his right hand at will, finally flooring Byrd twice in the ninth round. Byrd beat the count after the first knockdown, but was then battered down again and the bout was waved off by the referee.

In 2010, Byrd officially announced his retirement from boxing.

==Life outside boxing==

<doc id="1303474" wikidata="Q4354372" url="?curid=1303474" title="Teeline shorthand">
<text>Teeline is a shorthand system developed in 1968 by James Hill, a teacher of Pitman shorthand. It is accepted by the National Council for the Training of Journalists, which certifies the training of journalists in the United Kingdom.

It is mainly used for writing English within the Commonwealth of Nations, but can be adapted for use by other Germanic languages such as German and Swedish. Its strength over other forms of shorthand is fast learning, and speeds of up to 150 words per minute are possible, as it is common for users to create their own word groupings, increasing their speed.

==Writing style==
Teeline shorthand is a streamlined way to transcribe the spoken word quickly by removing unnecessary letters from words and making the letters themselves faster to write. Vowels are often removed when they are not the first or last letter of a word, and silent letters are also ignored. Common prefixes, suffixes, and letter groupings (such as &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;ing&quot;) are reduced to single symbols. The symbols themselves are derived from old cursive forms of the letters, with unnecessary parts removed. Unlike phonetics-based shorthands, such as Pitman, Teeline is a spelling-based system.

==Alphabet==

Teeline differs from many shorthand systems by basing itself on the alphabet as opposed to phonetics, making it simpler to learn but also carrying the speed limitations of the alphabet when compared to other systems. However, it is common to find some phonetics spellings used. For example, &quot;ph&quot; is often just written as an &quot;f&quot;, so the word &quot;phase&quot; would be written as if it were spelt &quot;fase&quot;. This coincides with the creator&#x27;s intentions of streamlining it as much as possible. As with many shorthand systems, there are few strict rules on how to write it, so it is common for users to make personal adaptations for their own use. Certain letters also have specific meanings as well as their traditional alphabetic value, as shown in the table below.

&quot;Note: there may also be some regional, dialectal, and linguistic additions to these.&quot;
==Writing technique==

Teeline eliminates unnecessary letters, so that the remaining letters can be written in one swift, sweeping movement. People who use it daily will run words together: proficient users develop their own forms for common phrases, such as &quot;more and more people&quot; and &quot;in the end&quot;.

It is possible to write most words using basic Teeline theory, which consists of the alphabet and vowel indicators, but learning advanced Teeline theory allows users to increase their speed to well in excess of 100 words per minute.

Examples of Teeline theory include blending of letters (such as CM, CN and PL) and the R principle.

Doubling is also commonly used in Teeline - this involves lengthening the outlines for D, T, L, M and W to indicate that an R comes after these outlines - for example, the &quot;D&quot; outline becomes &quot;DR&quot; when it is lengthened, and &quot;M&quot; becomes &quot;MR&quot;.

Speed can be dramatically increased through the use of reduced suffixes and prefixes that occur frequently, such as &quot;under-&quot;, &quot;multi-&quot; and &quot;trans-&quot;, along with &quot;-nce&quot;, &quot;-nch&quot;, &quot;-able&quot; and &quot;-ing&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Although Teeline is used primarily in English, it has been adapted to other languages in the past, namely Welsh, French, German, and Spanish.

== Notable users ==
Alastair Campbell used Teeline to write his diaries while serving as spokesman for UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has claimed to have 120 wpm ability. Campbell&#x27;s tutor later reported that he was first in his class, reaching 100 wpm before others. But journalist and media commentator Roy Greenslade has questioned the value of shorthand in the digital era, noting an instance where a reporter&#x27;s scrawl could not be read by a court-appointed expert. British MP Meg Hillier has said she wields Teeline at 100 wpm and is wary of any reporter who fires questions at her faster than she herself could jot down. Jon Harris of Cavendish Press says training programmes that omit Teeline are short-changing their trainees. &quot;Shorthand makes for a more rounded reporter; yet without it some of these courses are just &#x27;Del Boy&#x27; degrees,&quot; he told the &quot;UK Press Gazette&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Teeline appears on the cover of the album &quot;The Gaelic Chronicles&quot; by The Budapest Café Orchestra. Fiddler Christian Garrick said he was astounded to find a reporter using shorthand during an interview, and asked her to scrawl the words for the album cover.

Teeline is referenced in &quot;You&#x27;re with us now&quot;, the sixth episode of the second season of the American television show &quot;Hanna&quot;, as a journalist&#x27;s method for keeping notes that cannot be easily read by others.

It supplies a clue in episode 6 of series 7 of the Anglo-French TV show &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; entitled &quot;Meditated in Murder&quot;.

<doc id="1303478" wikidata="Q606720" url="?curid=1303478" title="Tortilla Flat">
<text>Tortilla Flat (1935) is an early John Steinbeck novel set in Monterey, California. The novel was the author&#x27;s first clear critical and commercial success.

The book portrays a group of &#x27;paisanos&#x27;—literally, countrymen—a small band of errant friends enjoying life and wine in the days after the end of World War I.

&quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; was made into a film in 1942. Steinbeck later returned to some of the panhandling locals of Monterey (though not the Mexican paisanos of the Flat) in his novel &quot;Cannery Row&quot; (1945).

==Plot==
Above the town of Monterey on the California coast lies the shabby district of Tortilla Flat, inhabited by a loose gang of jobless locals of Mexican-Indian-Spanish-Caucasian descent (who typically claim pure Spanish blood).

The central character, Danny, inherits two houses from his grandfather where he and his friends go to live. Danny&#x27;s house, and Danny&#x27;s friends, Steinbeck compares to the Round Table, and the Knights of the Round Table. Most of the action is set in the time of Steinbeck&#x27;s own late teenage and young adult years, shortly after World War I.

The following chapter titles from the work, along with short summaries, outline the adventures the dipsomaniacal group endure in order to procure red wine and friendship.

===Chapter summary===

1 &quot;How Danny, home from the wars, found himself an heir, and how he swore to protect the helpless.&quot; — After working as a mule-driver during The Great War, Danny returns to find he has inherited two houses from his deceased grandfather. Danny gets drunk and goes to jail. He and the jailer drink wine at Torelli&#x27;s. After escaping, Danny talks his friend, a clever man named Pilon, into sharing his brandy and his houses.

2 &quot;How Pilon was lured by greed of position to forsake Danny&#x27;s hospitality.&quot; — Danny fails to get the water turned on. Pilon kills a rooster, rents Danny&#x27;s second house for money which it is understood he will never pay, and exchanges paper roses for a gallon of Señora Torelli&#x27;s wine.

3 &quot;How the poison of possessions wrought with Pilon, and how evil temporarily triumphed in him.&quot; — Danny and Pilon share wine, two women, and a fight. Drunk a second time, Pilon sublets half his house to Pablo.

4 &quot;How Jesus Maria Corcoran, a good man, became an unwilling vehicle of evil.&quot; — Pablo, Pilon and Danny discuss women and the payment of rent. Pablo and Pilon sublet their house to Jesus Maria. Since he has just $3 and a dime with him, they take a $2 deposit and leave him the rest to buy a woman he likes a present.

5 &quot;How Saint Francis turned the tide and put a gentle punishment on Pilon and Pablo and Jesus Maria.&quot; — Pilon and Pablo enjoy two gallons of wine. Monterey prepares for night. Pablo enjoys dinner, firewood and love from Mrs. Torelli. Jesus Maria is beaten up by soldiers because he enjoys their whiskey and their girlfriend Arabella. Pablo&#x27;s candle, dedicated to St. Francis, burns down the house, while Danny, who is with Mrs. Morales next door, pays no attention.

6 &quot;How three sinful men, through contrition, attained peace. How Danny&#x27;s friends swore comradeship.&quot; — Pablo, Pilon and Jesus Maria sleep in the pine forest. They wake up smelling a picnic lunch which becomes theirs, and is shared with Danny, into whose remaining house they move.

7 &quot;How Danny&#x27;s friends became a force for good. How they succored the poor pirate.&quot; — The pirate, a mentally handicapped man who is followed by five dogs, is invited by Pilon to stay at Danny&#x27;s house. Pirate promised that if God would save his sick dog, he would buy a golden candlestick for St. Francis. The sickly dog recovered, though he was soon after run over by a truck. Pirate is determined to keep his promise to buy a gold candlestick for St. Francis with 1000 quarters, or &quot;two-bitses&quot; ($250). The Pirate is the only paisano who works, and makes 25 cents a day selling kindling, but lives on food scraps given in charity, and saves the cash. He has hidden a great bag of quarters, known about by all. When he reveals his treasure to them, they are guilted into aiding him in his endeavor.

8 &quot;How Danny&#x27;s Friends sought mystic treasure on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Eve. How Pilon found it and later how a pair of serge pants changed ownership twice.&quot; — Joe Portagee returns from army jail, burns down a whorehouse, goes to jail again. He and Pilon seek treasure in the woods on &quot;St. Andrew&#x27;s Eve&quot; (29 Nov), and see the faint beam from a spot which they mark. Next night, with wine Joe has gotten for a blanket he has stolen from Danny, they dig at the spot and uncover something labeled &quot;United States Geodetic Survey + 1915 + Elevation 600 Feet&quot;. Realizing it is a crime to take, they get drunk on the Seaside beach. Pilon, to punish Joe for stealing from his host, recovers the blanket and trades Joe&#x27;s pants for wine, leaving Joe naked on the beach.

9 &quot;How Danny was ensnared by a vacuum cleaner and how Danny&#x27;s friends rescued him.&quot; — Danny trades stolen copper nails for money for a vacuum cleaner from Mr. Simon, to give to Sweets Ramirez (who has no electricity). Sweets contentedly pretends she has electricity, pushing the machine over the floor while humming to herself, and Danny wins her favors. He spends every evening with Sweets, until Pilon, telling himself he misses his friend, takes the vacuum and trades it to Torelli, the local shopkeep, for wine. Torelli then finds the vacuum which has been &quot;run&quot; with pretend electricity, actually has a pretend motor.

10 &quot;How the friends solaced a corporal and in return received a lesson in paternal ethics.&quot; — Jesus Maria befriends a young man with a baby, and brings him to the house. The baby is sick. A &quot;Capitán&quot; has stolen the man&#x27;s wife. The baby dies, and the man explains why he wanted the baby to be a &quot;Generál&quot;, saying that if a mere Capitan could steal his own wife, then imagine what a general could take. The friends take few moments to digest the moral of this, then make a satirical statement in support.

11 &quot;How, under the most adverse circumstances, love came to Big Joe Portagee.&quot; — Joe Portagee comes out of the rain into Tia Ignacia&#x27;s. He drinks her wine, goes to sleep, and wakes up to a beating from the woman because he drank her wine and did NOT take advantage of her. In the midst of fending off this attack in the middle of the street and in the rain, he is stricken with lust. A policeman happens by and asks them to stop doing what they&#x27;re doing in middle of the muddy road.

12 &quot;How Danny&#x27;s friends assisted the pirate to keep a vow, and how as a reward for merit the pirate&#x27;s dogs saw a holy vision.&quot; — The pirate finally trusts Danny and delivers his bag of quarters into the house, whereupon the bag disappears. Big Joe is beaten into unconsciousness for stealing the money. The friends take the thousand quarters which the pirate has earned over several years of woodcutting, to Father Ramon for him to buy a candlestick and feast. In San Carlos Church on Sunday the Pirate sees his candlestick before St. Francis. The dogs rush into the church and must be removed. Later the pirate preaches all of Fr. Ramon&#x27;s St. Francis stories to the dogs, which are suddenly startled by something behind him, which the pirate believes must be a vision.

13 &quot;How Danny&#x27;s friends threw themselves to the aid of a distressed lady.&quot; — The unmarried Teresina Cortez has a menagerie of nine healthy babies and children, who all live on nothing but tortillas and beans, but nevertheless are found amazingly healthy by the school doctor. Teresina gleans the beans from the fields. As the Madonna of the tale, Teresina produces the droves of babies with seemingly no particular help. When the bean crop is ruined by rain, Danny&#x27;s housemates steal food all over Monterey for the children. It makes them sick. However, the arrival of some stolen sacks of beans at the door is deemed a miracle, the children regain their health, and Teresina is also pregnant again. She wonders which one of Danny&#x27;s friends was responsible.

14 &quot;Of the good life at Danny&#x27;s house, of a gift pig, of the pain of Tall Bob, and of the thwarted love of the viejo Ravanno. Why the windows shouldn&#x27;t be cleaned.&quot; The friends tell stories. Danny: how Cornelia lost Emilio&#x27;s little pig to its sow. Pablo: how everyone laughed after Tall Bob blew his nose off. Jesus Maria: how Petey Ravanno got Gracie by hanging himself and being rescued at exactly the right moment, thus convincing her of his love; and how Petey&#x27;s father the &quot;viejo&quot; (old man) hanged himself to get the same effect, but the door blew shut at exactly the wrong moment, and nobody saw him.

15 &quot;How Danny brooded and became mad. How the Devil in the shape of Torelli assaulted Danny&#x27;s house.&quot; — Danny moves to the forest and cannot be found by his friends. When Torelli shows the friends the bill of sale for Danny&#x27;s house, they steal and burn it.

16 &quot;Of the sadness of Danny. How through sacrifice Danny&#x27;s friends gave a party. How Danny was translated.&quot; — Danny is deeply remorseful. His friends work a whole day cutting squid for Chin Kee. All of Tortilla Flat makes a party at Danny&#x27;s home. He enjoys many women, and challenges all men to fight (wielding a table leg). He dies after a fall into the gulch.

17 &quot;How Danny&#x27;s sorrowing friends defied the conventions. How the talismanic bond was burned. How each friend departed alone.&quot; — Danny&#x27;s friends cannot dress adequately for his military funeral. They tell stories of him beforehand, in the gulch. Afterward, they drink wine stolen by Pilon from Torelli&#x27;s. Pablo sings &quot;Tuli Pan&quot;. A small fire is accidentally set in the house, and the friends watch in approval, doing nothing to save it. No two walk away together from the smoking ruins.

==Reception==

&quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; provided Steinbeck with his first commercial success.
Thomas Fensch, in an introduction to the novel, cited the idyllic setting, where &quot;money is seldom needed&quot; and all the characters desire is &quot;enough food, a warm place to sleep, wine, and – occasionally – women and parties&quot; as providing escapism for readers during the Great Depression.

Contemporary critics praised the novel as entertainment, although some criticised the meandering plot. The &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; described the book as a &quot;grand time&quot; though the reviewer also felt that the ending &quot;feels a little too casual to be moving&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, meanwhile, praised Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;gift for drollery and for turning Spanish talk and phrases into a gently mocking English&quot;.
