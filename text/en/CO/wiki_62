TCL Technology&#x27;s business structure is focused on three major sectors: semiconductor display, semiconductor and semiconductor photovoltaic, and industrial finance and capital.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1981 by 2 close friends, Tomson Li Dongsheng and Luca Situ under the brand name TTK as an audio cassette manufacturer. It was founded as a state-owned enterprise.

In 1985, after being sued by Japanese cassette manufacturer TDK for intellectual property violation, the company changed its brand name to TCL by taking the initials from Telecom Corporation Limited.

In 1999, TCL entered the Vietnamese market.

On 19 September 2002, TCL announced the acquisition of all consumer electronics related assets of the former German company Schneider Rundfunkwerke, including the right to use its trademarks as &quot;Schneider&quot;, &quot;Dual&quot;, &quot;Albona&quot;, &quot;Joyce&quot; and &quot;Logix&quot;.

In July 2003, TCL chairman Li Dongsheng formally announced a &quot;Dragon and Tiger Plan&quot; to establish two competitive TCL businesses in global markets (&quot;Dragons&quot;) and three leading businesses inside China (&quot;Tigers&quot;).

In November 2003, TCL and Vantiva (then-named Thomson SA) of France announced the creation of a joint venture to produce televisions and DVD players worldwide. TCL took a 67 percent stake in the joint venture, with Thomson SA holding the rest of the shares, and it was agreed that televisions made by TCL-Thomson would be marketed under the TCL brand in Asia, and the Thomson and RCA brands in Europe and North America.

In April 2004, TCL and Alcatel announced the creation of a mobile phone manufacturing joint venture: Alcatel Mobile. TCL injected 55 million euros in the venture in return for a 55 per cent shareholding.

In April 2005, TCL closed its manufacturing plant in TÃ¼rkheim, Bavaria, laying off 120 former &quot;Schneider&quot; employees.

In May 2005, TCL announced that its Hong Kong-listed unit would acquire Alcatel&#x27;s 45 per cent stake in their mobile-phone joint venture for consideration of HK$63.34 million ($8.1 million) worth of TCL Communication shares.

In June 2007, TCL announced that its mobile phone division planned to cease using the Alcatel brand and switch entirely to the TCL brand within five years.

In April 2008, Samsung Electronics announced that it would be outsourcing the production of some LCD TV modules to TCL.

In July 2008, TCL announced that it planned to raise 1.7 billion yuan ($249 million) via a share placement on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to fund the construction of two production lines for LCD televisions; one for screens of up to 42 inches, and the other for screens of up to 56 inches. TCL sold a total of 4.18 million LCD TV sets in 2008, more than triple the number during 2007.

In January 2009, TCL announced plans to double its LCD TV production capacity to 10 million units by the end of 2009.

In November 2009, TCL announced that it had formed a joint-venture with the Shenzhen government to construct an 8.5-generation thin film transistor-liquid crystal display production facility in the city at a cost of $3.9 billion.

In March 2010, TCL Electronics raised HK$525 million through the sale of shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, in order to fund the development of its LCD and LED businesses and to generate working capital.

In May 2011, TCL launched the China Smart Multimedia Terminal Technology Association in partnership with Hisense Electric Co. and Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., with the aim of helping to establish industry standards for smart televisions.

In 2014, TCL changed the meaning of its identifying initials from &quot;Telephone Communication Limited&quot; to a branding slogan, &quot;The Creative Life&quot;, for commercial purposes.

In February 2014, TCL spent 280 million RMB to purchase 11 percent shareholdings of Tianjin 712 Communication &amp; Broadcasting Co., Ltd, a Chinese military-owned company which produces communication devices and navigation systems for the Chinese army.

In August 2014, TCL partnered with Roku for use as TCL&#x27;s primary smart TV platform. TCL Corporation and Tonly Electronics was implicated in bribing a government official in Guangdong province in exchange for government subsidies.

In October 2014, TCL acquired the Palm brand from HP for use on smartphones.

In 2016, TCL reached an agreement with BlackBerry Limited to produce smartphones under the BlackBerry brand, under BlackBerry Mobile. This deal ceased on 31 August 2020.

In 2019, due to restructuring, TCL completed the handover of major assets and was split into TCL Technology Group Corporation (TCL Technology) and TCL Industrial Holdings (TCL Industrials).

==Politics==
The FargoâMoorhead area has generally leaned Republican, voting for that party&#x27;s presidential candidate in every election between 1968 and 2004. While Clay County is a swing county which has voted for Democrats 9 times and Republicans 7 times since 1960, Cass County has only voted Democratic twice: for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama in 2008. 

In recent years, however, FargoâMoorhead has become very competitive. In 2008, it voted for Obama by a nearly-10-point margin, followed by just 0.2% in 2012. In 2016, it flipped Republican once again, voting for Donald Trump by 8 points, and it voted for Trump again in 2020, albeit by a narrow margin of less than a percentage point.

== Culture ==
==Fargo/Wahpeton CSA==
The Census Bureau also tracks a FargoâWahpeton Combined Statistical Area, consisting of Cass and Clay counties, as well as the Wahpeton micropolitan area of Richland County, North Dakota and Wilkin County, Minnesota. This area includes the twin cities of Wahpeton, North Dakota and Breckenridge, Minnesota. 

The FargoâMoorhead urban core is actually about forty-five minutes of highway travel from the WahpetonâBreckenridge core. The main connection between these two pairs of cities is the Red River Valley, the flat, fertile land that both depend upon for a major part of their economies. Potatoes and sugar beets are important crops in the region, in addition to most of the other crops produced elsewhere in Minnesota and North Dakota.

<doc id="1291730" wikidata="Q4839612" url="?curid=1291730" title="Backfeeding">
<text>Backfeeding is the flow of electric power in the direction reverse to that of the generally understood or typical flow of power. Depending on the source of the power, this reverse flow may be intentional or unintentional. If not prevented (in the case of unintentional backfeeding) or properly performed (in cases of intentional backfeeding), backfeeding may present unanticipated hazards to electrical grid equipment and service personnel.

== Types of backfeeding ==

=== Intentional backfeeding ===
Development and economization of consumer power generation equipment such as wind turbines and photovoltaic systems has led to an increase in the number of consumers that may produce more electrical power than they consume during peak generating conditions. If supported by the consumer&#x27;s electric utility provider, the excess power generated may be fed back into the electrical grid. This process makes the typical consumer a temporary producer while the flow of electrical power remains reversed. When backfeeding is performed this way, electric utility providers will install a specially engineered electrical meter that is capable of net metering. 

=== Unintentional backfeeding ===
A common source of unintentional backfeeding is an electrical generator (typically a portable generator) that is improperly connected to a building electrical system. A properly installed electrical generator incorporates the use of a transfer switch or generator interlock kit to ensure the incoming electrical service line is disconnected when the generator is providing power to the building. In the absence (or improper usage) of a transfer switch, unintentional backfeeding may occur when the power provided by the electrical generator is able to flow over the electrical service line. Because an electrical transformer is capable of operating in both directions, electrical power generated from equipment on the consumer&#x27;s premises can backfeed through the transformer and energize the distribution line to which the transformer is connected.

=== Intrinsic backfeeding ===
Backfeeding also exists in other instances where a location that is typically a generator becomes a consumer. This is commonly seen when an electrical generation plant is shut down or operating at such a reduced capacity that its parasitic load becomes greater than its generated power. The parasitic power load is the result of the usage of: pumps, facility lighting, HVAC equipment, and other control equipment that must remain active regardless of actual electrical power production. Electrical utilities often take steps to decrease their overall parasitic load to minimize this type of backfeeding and improve efficiency.

== Grid design considerations ==
For manufacturing cost and operational simplicity reasons, most circuit (overcurrent) protection and power quality control (voltage regulation) devices used by electric utility companies are designed with the assumption that power always flows in one direction. An interconnection agreement can be arranged for equipment designed to backfeed from the consumer&#x27;s equipment to the electrical utility provider&#x27;s distribution system. This type of interconnection can involve nontrivial engineering and usage of costly specialized equipment designed to keep distribution circuits and equipment properly protected. Such costs may be minimized by limiting distributed generation capacity to less than that which is consumed locally, and guaranteeing this condition by installing a reverse-power cutoff relay that opens if backfeeding occurs.

== Safety and operational hazards ==

Because it involves transfer of significant amounts of energy, backfeeding must be carefully controlled and monitored. Personnel working on equipment subject to backfeeding must be aware of all possible power sources, and follow systematic protocols to ensure that equipment is fully de-energized before commencing work, or use special equipment and techniques suitable for working on live equipment.

When working on de-energized power conductors, lineworkers attach temporary protective grounding assemblies or &quot;protective ground sets&quot;, which short all conductors to each other and to an earth ground. This ensures that no wires can become energized, whether by accidental switching or by unintentional backfeeding.

Because of the hazards presented by unintentional backfeeding, the usage of equipment that defeats engineered or standardized safety mechanisms such as double-ended power cords (an electrical cord that has a male electrical plug on both ends) is illegal and against the United States National Electrical Code.

<text>Dietrich Markwart Eberhart Mateschitz (, ; 20 May 1944 â 22 October 2022) was an Austrian billionaire businessman. He was the co-founder and 49% owner of Red Bull GmbH. In April 2022, Mateschitz&#x27;s net worth was estimated at US$27.4 billion.

Mateschitz worked in marketing for Unilever and Blendax. While travelling in Thailand, he discovered the drink Krating Daeng, which he adapted into Red Bull. He founded Red Bull GmbH in 1984 and launched it in Austria in 1987. His company acquired or founded several sports teams around the world, including six-time Constructors&#x27; Champions Red Bull Racing and sister team RB in Formula One, and association football teams including FC Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig.

==Early life and education==

Mateschitz was born on 20 May 1944, in Sankt Marein im MÃ¼rztal, Styria, Austria, to a family of Slovene-Styrian or Croatian ancestry. His mother&#x27;s side was from present-day Styria, his father&#x27;s side was from Maribor (then still part of Styria, but now in Slovenia); some sources place his ancestry in the area of Zadar where he allegedly had relatives and the surname &quot;MateÅ¡iÄ&quot; was common. He declared himself a &quot;Styrian cosmopolitan&quot;. Both his parents were school teachers. He attended the &quot;Hochschule fÃ¼r Welthandel&quot; (now Vienna University of Economics and Business), where after ten years, he graduated with a marketing degree in 1972. He was keen and passionate about extreme sports at an early age.

==Career==
Mateschitz&#x27;s first employer was Unilever, where he worked marketing detergents. He subsequently moved to Blendax, the German cosmetics company (since bought by Procter &amp; Gamble), where he worked on, among other things, the marketing of Blendax toothpaste. It was as part of his travels for Blendax, on the way from Bangkok airport to the city centre, that Mateschitz bought a bottle of Krating Daeng, the drink that would later become Red Bull. &quot;One glass [of Krating Daeng] and the jet lag was gone&quot;, he recalled. Sensing the commercial opportunities of this drink in Europe, Mateschitz struck a partnership deal with the Thai businessman Chaleo Yoovidhya who had already been successfully selling Krating Daeng to lorry drivers and factory workers.

In 1984, he founded Red Bull GmbH with Yoovidhya, launching the brand in Austria in 1987. Subsequently, he turned the Red Bull drink into a world market leader among energy drinks. It was revealed that he worked on the formula for around three years before the modified drink was launched under the new name Red Bull in 1987.

Mateschitz also owned &quot;Seitenblicke&quot;, Austria&#x27;s top society magazine, but avoided the celebrity circuit and watched most Formula One races on TV despite owning two teams. He also founded Media House in Austria in 2007 by providing various digital entertainment and thousands of hours of images to interested broadcasters.

Mateschitz owned ServusTV, a television channel based in Salzburg. The channel was criticised for allegedly downplaying the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. The channel is considered to have a right-wing position, and was one of only three media outlets given a press pass to the &quot;Defenders of Europe&quot; conference of right-wing and far-right activists in October 2016. In May 2016, Mateschitz announced he would shut down the channel as his employees had requested to form a works council; he changed his mind when no such council was formed.

===Sports===
Mateschitz&#x27;s brands are consistently marketed as associated with the physical and mental attributes needed for various types of extreme sports such as surfing, skydiving, cliff diving, winter sports and mountain biking through commercial sponsorship. Under his tenure, Red Bull was widely acclaimed for its creative and intensive marketing of extreme sports. The successful high altitude skydiving exploration from the edge of space which was carried out by Red Bull Stratos in collaboration with Felix Baumgartner in October 2012 is considered as one of the turning points in Red Bull&#x27;s history in terms of its intensive marketing strategies in the context of extreme sports.

====Motorsport====
Red Bull formerly owned more than 60 percent of the Sauber Formula One motor racing team, and was the team&#x27;s main sponsor. However, Red Bull ended its relationship with Sauber at the end of 2001 after the team opted to sign Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen as one of their drivers for the 2001 season instead of Red Bull protege Enrique Bernoldi. In November 2004, Mateschitz bought the failing Jaguar Racing Formula One team from its previous owners, Ford, and he renamed it as a full-blown Red Bull Racing team for the following season in 2005. The fee was $1. Red Bull recruited former Formula-2 driver Christian Horner as team principal while also bringing one of the sport&#x27;s leading design engineer Adrian Newey on board as the technical director for a salary of $10m.

In September 2005, Mateschitz joined forces with his close friend and former Formula One driver, Gerhard Berger, to purchase the Italian-registered Minardi team from its Australian owner Paul Stoddart. This team was meant to serve as a Junior team to Red Bull Racing and was renamed as &quot;Scuderia Toro Rosso&quot; () in 2006, &quot;AlphaTauri&quot; in 2020, and in 2024 as Visa Cash App RB. 
Sebastian Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix for Toro Rosso. His victory at the 2009 Chinese Grand Prix was the first for Red Bull Racing. In 2010, Red Bull Racing won the Formula One World Constructors&#x27; Championship and Vettel won the Drivers&#x27; Championship. They then went on to win both titles for the next three years running in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Eight years later they won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship again with Max Verstappen in the 2021 season, while finishing runners-up in the Formula One World Constructors&#x27; Championship which was won by Mercedes. In the 2022 season, Verstappen retained his title, the sixth by a Red Bull driver. Prior to Max Verstappen&#x27;s heroics, Red Bull endured a rough patch and lean phase having gone winless in the Constructor&#x27;s Championship for around eight years, coinciding with the arrival of F1&#x27;s turbo-hybrid engines which first came into the picture in 2014 that even led to a fallout with their main engine supplier Renault. Red Bull made a dramatic turnaround in both 2021 and 2022 seasons albeit of a reunion with Honda which put an end to an eight-year title drought that was eluded largely due to the domination of Mercedes from 2014 to 2020.

From 2006 to 2011, Mateschitz also owned Team Red Bull who competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and the K&amp;N Pro Series East.

In late 2004, he bought the A1-Ring racing circuit, which had formerly hosted the Formula One Austrian Grand Prix, and renamed it the Red Bull Ring. The circuit re-opened in May 2011 and hosted a round of the 2011 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season. Although Mateschitz had stated that there were no plans for it to return to the Formula One calendar, in December 2012 Red Bull notified the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile they would be open to hosting a Grand Prix. In July 2013, Red Bull announced the return of the Austrian Grand Prix to the Formula One World Championship in 2014. The race took place on 22 June 2014 and was won by Nico Rosberg, driving for Mercedes.

====Football and ice hockey====

In April 2005, he bought the Austrian football club SV Austria Salzburg, and in March 2006, he bought the American soccer team MetroStars; both clubs were subsequently renamed after his famous drink, as the Red Bull Salzburg and the New York Red Bulls, respectively. In 2007, Red Bull founded Red Bull Brasil, a football team based in Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, and in 2019 the company acquired Clube AtlÃ©tico Bragantino, also in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. In 2008, Red Bull founded Red Bull Ghana, a football academy in Sogakope which was sold to Dutch club Feyenoord in 2014.

In May 2009, he founded the German football club RB Leipzig, after buying the license from SSV MarkranstÃ¤dt. They debuted in the Oberliga, the fifth tier of the German football league system. The team rose to the top-tier Bundesliga in 2016, made the UEFA Champions League semi-finals in 2020 and won the DFB-Pokal in 2022 and 2023 and the DFL-Supercup in 2023.

He also owned the ice hockey clubs EC Red Bull Salzburg and EHC Red Bull MÃ¼nchen, which were acquired and rebranded in 2000 and 2012, respectively.

=== Philanthropy ===
Mateschitz was co-founder of the &quot;Wings for Life&quot; foundation that supports spinal cord research together with Heinz Kinigadner. Since 2014, the foundation has organised the Wings for Life World Run to raise funds.

Mateschitz personally donated 70 million euros to Paracelsus Medical University for a research center on spinal cord injuries.

He also initiated the World Stunt Awards, an annual fundraiser to benefit his Taurus Foundation, which, according to its website, helps injured stunt professionals.

==Personal life and death==
Mateschitz never married; he had a son named Mark, born in May 1992. As of the time of Mateschitz&#x27;s death, his son was the managing director of one of his investment companies. Mateschitz rarely gave interviews, and refused to answer questions about his son. He remained a reclusive figure maintaining low profile despite his heavy involvement with Formula One. He was also known for his simplicity of dress, often being seen wearing casual clothing, including denim pants and sunglasses. Mateschitz was in a relationship with the mother of his son, Anita Gerhardter, for two years, and later had a long-term partner named Marion Feichtner. He was known as a recluse, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in 50 friends. I believe in a smaller number. Nor do I care about society events. It&#x27;s the most senseless use of time. When I do go out, from time to time, it&#x27;s just to convince myself again that I&#x27;m not missing a lot&quot;.

He held a pilot&#x27;s licence and enjoyed flying a Falcon 900 and a Piper Super Cub. He had his own hangar with a collection of old planes, including the last Douglas DC-6B ever produced, which once belonged to Yugoslav Marshal Josip Broz Tito.

Mateschitz and his Bundesliga club RB Leipzig faced backlash in 2017 over comments he made in a &quot;Kleine Zeitung&quot; interview in which he suggested that Austria should close its borders to refugees and expressed his support for Donald Trump and other populist positions. He went on to strongly criticize both the Government of Germany and the Government of Austria for their policies during the 2015 European migrant crisis.

Mateschitz lived in Fuschl am See, Austria and also owned the island of Laucala in Fiji, which he bought from the Forbes family for Â£7 million. He spent millions to acquire and conserve houses and castles in the Austrian Alps, saying &quot;I want to enjoy these places myself, but I also want to take care of them&quot;.

Mateschitz once said that he drank 10 to 12 cans of Red Bull every day. Mateschitz died following a long period of treatment for pancreatic cancer, at his home in St. Wolfgang im Salzkammergut on 22 October 2022, at age 78.

<text>&quot;Something in the Way&quot; is a song by American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It is the 12th song on their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, released in September 1991. It is the final listed song on the album, although most copies of &quot;Nevermind&quot; also feature the hidden track &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot;, which occupies the same track as &quot;Something in the Way&quot; and begins after approximately 10 minutes of silence.

Never released as a single and never a consistent part of the band&#x27;s live setlist, &quot;Something in the Way&quot; charted for the first time in August 2020, after appearing in the first trailer for the 2022 superhero film, &quot;The Batman&quot;. The song peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;â³s US Rock Digital Songs Sales chart, and number five on their US Alternative Digital Songs Sales charts. It also reached the top 20 in both Amazon Music&#x27;s and iTunes&#x27; digital music charts.

On the week of March 26, 2022, the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 46, becoming the band&#x27;s fifth entry on the chart and first since &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; in 2002. It also made the Top 40 in Australia, Canada, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Lithuania, New Zealand, Wales and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Global 200.

==Early history==

&quot;Something in the Way&quot; was written by Cobain in 1990. The earliest known version is a solo electric demo that appeared in a medley, along with the abandoned compositions &quot;You Can&#x27;t Change Me&quot; and &quot;Burn My Britches,&quot; first released on the Cobain compilation &quot;Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings&quot; in November 2015. American director Brett Morgen, who compiled the album as a soundtrack to his 2015 Cobain documentary &quot;Montage of Heck&quot;, discussed the medley in a 2015 &quot;NME&quot; interview, saying it was &quot;almost like a rock opera, and to hear &#x27;Something in the Way&#x27; emerge from the ashes of those other tracks was quite revealing. Kurt might&#x27;ve done an edit on that track, but I believe it was close to a continuous take.&quot;

The first live performance of &quot;Something in the Way&quot; was on November 25, 1990, at The Off Ramp CafÃ© in Seattle.

==&quot;Nevermind&quot;==

&quot;Something in the Way&quot; was first recorded in the studio in May 1991 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California by Butch Vig, for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. According to Vig, Cobain had originally wanted to record the song&#x27;s instruments with the full band, but when initial attempts at this were unsuccessful, Cobain sat on a couch in the control room of studio A and played the song for Vig on acoustic guitar, to show him how he thought it should sound. Vig was impressed with the way Cobain&#x27;s solo rendition sounded, and after turning off the air-conditioning and unplugging the telephone in the control room, set up microphones and recorded the song this way instead, starting with the guitar and the vocals.

This became the core of the recording, with the first vocal take being used for the verses. Cobain then recorded vocal harmonies, and drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Krist Novoselic added their parts, though both Grohl and Novoselic had difficulty playing in time with Cobain&#x27;s performance. Novoselic also had trouble tuning his bass to Cobain&#x27;s guitar, a 12-string Stella acoustic with five nylon guitar strings that Cobain had never tuned, and Grohl had to play more quietly than he was used to, to match the song&#x27;s gentle mood. &quot;Kurt and I wanted the drums to be very understated,&quot; Vig recalled. &quot;Dave was used to playing much louder; plus, it can be very difficult to go back and lay drums over an acoustic guitar track, as the meter may vary a bit&quot;. Cobain&#x27;s harmonies, the bass and the drums were recorded in studio B, a smaller room down the hall from the larger one they generally worked in. On the final day of the &quot;Nevermind&quot; sessions, Kirk Canning, a friend of the band&#x27;s they had met through L7, added cello to the recording, although he too had difficulties tuning to Cobain&#x27;s guitar.

==Post-&quot;Nevermind&quot;==

On November 9, 1991, a version of the song was recorded by Miti Adhikari for the BBC program &quot;The Evening Session&quot; at Maida Vale Studios in London, England. This heavier electric version was more reminiscent of the way the song usually sounded when performed in concert. It was posthumously released on the 20th anniversary &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; versions of &quot;Nevermind&quot; in September 2011.

&quot;Something in the Way&quot; was performed as part of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert on November 18, 1993, at Sony Music Studios in New York City. This version featured Pat Smear on second guitar and Lori Goldston on cello. 
This song was performed live by Nirvana for the final time a week later, on November 26, 1993, at the Morocco Shrine Auditorium.

==Composition==
===Music===

Describing the song as &quot;sombre and disconsolate,&quot; American music journalist Gillian G. Garr wrote that &quot;Something in the Way&quot; &quot;underscores the fact that Nirvana not only realized that emotions didn&#x27;t always have to be expressed at the highest volume, they were also capable of pulling it off, with Cobain turning in one of his most expressive vocal performances.&quot;

===Lyrics===

&quot;Something in the Way&quot; was originally believed to be based on a period when Cobain was homeless and slept underneath the Young Street Bridge, close to his childhood home in his native town of Aberdeen, Washington. While Cobain did run away from home as a teenager, the belief that he slept under the bridge was refuted by both Novoselic and Kurt&#x27;s sister, Kim Cobain, in the 2001 Cobain biography, &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;. Both confirmed that Cobain &quot;hung out&quot; under the bridge, which was a popular recreation area favored by local teenagers, but Novoselic told author Charles R. Cross that the river&#x27;s &quot;tides&quot; and &quot;muddy banks&quot; would have made staying there for a prolonged period of time impossible. Cross argued that the much larger Sixth Street Bridge, located about half-a-mile away (and favoured by Aberdeen&#x27;s homeless population) would have been more suitable to sleep under, but is unlikely to have been used by Cobain.

According to Cross, the reality of Cobain&#x27;s situation during his approximately four-month period of homelessness was &quot;more poignant&quot; than the version presented in &quot;Something in the Way.&quot; At first, Cobain slept &quot;curled up like a kitten&quot; in a cardboard refrigerator box on the porch of Dale Crover, drummer of local band, the Melvins. After this, he would sleep in the hallways of old apartment buildings with central heating, leaving before the residents of the building left their apartments. Occasionally, he and a friend would watch television and sleep in the waiting room of Grays Harbor Hospital, with Cobain getting food from the cafeteria by charging it to invented room numbers.

Cobain himself suggested that the song was not necessarily autobiographical, telling Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad that the lyrics were &quot;like if I was living under the bridge and I was dying of AIDS, if I was sick and I couldn&#x27;t move and I was a total street person. That was kind of the fantasy of it&quot;.

In Azzerad&#x27;s 1993 biography &quot;Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Cobain stated that he used to fish from the Wishkah River close to this bridge, which may have inspired the lyric, &quot;Its okay to eat fish, &#x27;cos they don&#x27;t have any feelings&quot; in the song.

In a 2021 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview, Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love, called &quot;Something in the Way&quot; &quot;one of the great rock songs of all time,&quot; and described it as Cobain &quot;clawing his way out...He&#x27;s telling himself anything just to get through.&quot; Love cited the line, &quot;It&#x27;s OK to eat fish cause they don&#x27;t have any feelings&quot; as the one that affected her the most deeply, saying, &quot;He knows it&#x27;s a lie â here&#x27;s a guy who loved turtles â but he thinks that if someone just loves him enough, then maybe, just maybe one day he will become real.&quot; In regards to the song&#x27;s fictionalized aspects, Love said that &quot;the place [Cobain] writes from is so emotionally desperate we all understand it.&quot;

===Possible co-authorship===
According to American musician Nick Oliveri, some of the song&#x27;s lyrics were contributed by Mark Lanegan, vocalist of Seattle rock band Screaming Trees, who later joined the band in which Oliveri played bass, Queens of the Stone Age, as an additional vocalist. In the 2023 book &quot;Lanegan&quot;, Oliveri recalled the event: Oliveri told author Greg Prato that he remembered Lanegan &quot;kicking himself in the butt a little bit about that&quot; later on, knowing that &quot;he would have had a lot of money&quot; if he had received a songwriting credit on the song.

==Release and reception==
In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the song at number five on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; placed it at number 12 in their list of &quot;Nirvana&#x27;s 20 greatest songs&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked it 11th on &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list in 2023.

In 2017, to mark what would have been Cobain&#x27;s 50th birthday, the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the 20 most played Nirvana songs on the TV and radio in the UK, in which &quot;Something in the Way&quot; was ranked at number 17.

===Posthumous chart success===

In August 2020, the song reached number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;â³s US Rock Digital Songs Sales chart, number five on their US Alternative Digital Songs Sales chart, and number 45 on their all-genre Digital Song Sales chart, as well as number 18 on Amazon Music&#x27;s &quot;Best Sellers in Songs&quot; chart, and number 19 on iTunes&#x27; top 200 songs chart, after appearing in the first trailer for the film, &quot;The Batman.&quot;

Streams of the song spiked by 1200% on Spotify shortly after the release of the film on March 4, 2022, helping it reach the top five of Spotify&#x27;s Daily USA Top 50 songs ranking on March 8. An article published by &quot;Variety&quot; on March 11 reported that the song was currently third on Spotify&#x27;s daily list. According to a March 15 &quot;Billboard&quot; article, the song earned 7.9 million on-demand official U.S. streams during the March 4 to March 10 tracking period, marking a 1,508% increase, and 3,100 downloads, a gain of 1,888%. Interest in the song also helped boost sales of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, which climbed to number one on the Top Rock Albums and Top Alternative Albums charts.

On the week of March 26, 2022, &quot;Something in the Way&quot; became the fifth Nirvana song to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, appearing at number 46 its one-week stay on the chart.

==MTV Unplugged in New York==
The &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; version of &quot;Something in the Way&quot; was one of two songs not included in the original broadcast of the show. However, it appeared on the live album &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, released in November 1994. It also appeared as the b-side to the album&#x27;s only commercial single, for the song &quot;About a Girl&quot;. In 2002, it was included on vinyl and Japanese CD copies of the band&#x27;s best-of compilation, &quot;Nirvana&quot;.

The full &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance, including &quot;Something in the Way,&quot; was released on DVD in November 2007.

In a 2023 Instagram comment, Cobain&#x27;s and Love&#x27;s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, named &quot;Something in the Way&quot; as her favorite performance from the band&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; set, writing, &quot;I like to imagine that if we had been able to grow up together, he wouldâve been gentle with me in the same way he was gentle singing that song.&quot;

==In popular culture==
A brief cover of the song, performed by Jerry O&#x27;Connell in the role of Frank &quot;Cush&quot; Cushman, appeared in the 1996 romantic comedy &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, directed by Cameron Crowe. The intentionally poor rendition appeared during a hotel room scene in which &quot;Cush disrupts football business talk with a nasally, out-of-tune take on Nirvanaâs darkest track off &quot;Nevermind&quot;,&quot; according to Ashley Zlatopolsky of &quot;Billboard.&quot;

The &quot;Nevermind&quot; version appeared in the 2005 war drama &quot;Jarhead&quot;, directed by Sam Mendes. According to Universal Pictures president of film music Kathy Nelson, Mendes had insisted on the song, but a then-ongoing dispute between Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love, and surviving Nirvana members had made the licensing of Nirvana songs difficult at the time. However, Love allowed the song&#x27;s use due to being a &quot;huge fan&quot; of Mendes and actor Peter Sarsgaard. &quot;That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s probably the first Nirvana song you&#x27;ve heard in a movie,&quot; Nelson said.

On April 24, 2020, American musician Post Malone performed the song during his 15-song Nirvana tribute concert, which was livestreamed on YouTube and raised more than $4 million for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.

===&quot;The Batman&quot;===

American filmmaker Matt Reeves, writer and director of the 2022 film &quot;The Batman&quot;, revealed in a December 2021 interview with &quot;Gizmodo&quot; that listening to the song while writing the film&#x27;s first act played a key role in helping him develop the character of Bruce Wayne. &quot;Rather than make Bruce the playboy version weâve seen before,&quot; Reeves explained, &quot;thereâs another version who had gone through a great tragedy and become a recluse. So I started making this connection to Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Last Days&quot;, and the idea of this fictionalized version of Kurt Cobain being in this kind of decaying manor.&quot;

In a March 2022 &quot;NME&quot; interview, American actor Paul Dano revealed that the song also influenced his portrayal of the film&#x27;s villain, the Riddler. &quot;Well, in the script Matt had actually mentioned âSomething In The Wayâ by Nirvana,&quot; Dano told interviewer Olly Richards. &quot;So that right there, that song, those words, that refrain, became hugely important to me. Nirvana became a part of that [character].&quot;

The version featured in the film&#x27;s August 2020 trailer is a remix of the &quot;Nevermind&quot; version by Alloy Tracks and Cavalry Music that incorporated themes by the film&#x27;s composer Michael Giacchino and additional orchestral elements.

The song itself appears twice in the film, serving as a bookend for the first and third acts.

Following the theatrical release of the film in March 2022, audio streaming service Spotify reported a 1,200% increase in streams of the song on the platform, while &quot;Billboard&quot; reported a 1,508% increase in official U.S. streams and 1,888% increase in downloads. The song once again appeared on several &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, reaching number two on the Rock Streaming Songs and Rock Digital Song Sales chart, number four on the Alternative Digital Song Sales and Alternative Streaming Songs chart, number 20 on the Digital Song Sales chart, and number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Streaming Songs chart. American DJ Illenium remixed the song in collaboration with DC following the success of the film.

==Covers==
At Sea originally recorded &quot;Something in the Way&quot; for their 2012 album &quot;A New Machine&quot;. It was eventually used in the E3 2014 trailer for the PlayStation 4 remaster of &quot;The Last of Us&quot;.

Tunisian singer Emel Mathlouthi released a cover in English and Arabic in 2020 on her album &quot;The Tunis Diaries&quot;.

Transgender activist Daniella Carter and J Patt from The Knocks recorded an electronic cover version of the song in 2021. It is the debut single from &quot;Nirvana Reimagined as House and Techno&quot; by music producer Jonathan Hay.

<doc id="1291740" wikidata="Q583885" url="?curid=1291740" title="Pinus monophylla">
<text>Pinus monophylla, the single-leaf pinyon, (alternatively spelled piÃ±on) is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to North America. The range is in southernmost Idaho, western Utah, Arizona, southwest New Mexico, Nevada, eastern and southern California and northern Baja California.

It occurs at moderate altitudes from , rarely as low as and as high as . It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, often mixed with junipers in the Pinyon-juniper woodland plant community. Single-leaf pinyon is the world&#x27;s only one-needled pine.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus monophylla&quot; is a small to medium size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to rarely more. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are, uniquely for a pine, usually single (not two or more in a fascicle, though trees with needles in pairs are found occasionally), stout, long, and grey-green to strongly glaucous blue-green, with stomata over the whole needle surface (and on both inner and outer surfaces of paired needles). The cones are acute-globose, the largest of the true pinyons, long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18â20 months old, with only a small number of very thick scales, typically 8â20 fertile scales. The cones thus grow over a two-year (26-month) cycle, so that newer green and older, seed-bearing or open brown cones are on the tree at the same time.
The seed cones open to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are long, with a thin shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial wing. Empty pine nuts with undeveloped seeds (self-pollinated) are a light tan color, while the &quot;good&quot; ones are dark brown. The pine nuts are dispersed by the pinyon jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones, choosing only the dark ones and leaving the light ones (as in image at right). The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use by burying them. Some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. Indeed, Pinyon seeds will rarely germinate in the wild unless they are cached by jays or other animals.

== Taxonomy ==
There are three subspecies:
* &quot;Pinus monophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;monophylla&quot;. Most of the range, except for the areas below. Needles more stout, bright blue-green, with 2â7 resin canals and 8â16 stomatal lines. Cones are long, often longer than broad.
* &quot;Pinus monophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;californiarum&quot; (D. K. Bailey) Zavarin. Southernmost Nevada, southwest through southeastern California (northwest only as far as the San Jacinto Mountains) to 29Â°N in northern Baja California. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 8â16 resin canals and 13â18 stomatal lines. Cones are long, broader than long.
* &quot;Pinus monophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;fallax&quot; (E. L. Little) D.K. Bailey. Slopes of the lower Colorado River valley and adjacent tributaries from St. George, Utah to the Hualapai Mountains, and along the lower flank of the Mogollon Rim to Silver City, New Mexico. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 2â3 resin canals and 8â16 stomatal lines. Cones are long, broader than long.

It is most closely related to the Colorado pinyon, which hybridises with it (both subsps. &quot;monophylla&quot; and &quot;fallax&quot;) occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It also (subsp. &quot;californiarum&quot;) hybridises extensively with Parry pinyon. This classification of pinyon species based only upon the presence of single-needle fascicles is brought into doubt by the reporting of trees from both the Pinus monophylla/Pinus edulis and the Pinus monophylla subsp. fallax/Pinus edulis zones as growing more single needle fascicles after dry years and more two-needled fascicles after wet years.
=== Mojave National Preserve ===
An isolated population of single-leaf pinyon trees in the Mojave Desert&#x27;s New York Mountains, within the Mojave National Preserve of southeast California, has needles mostly in pairs and was previously thought to be Colorado pinyons. They have recently been shown to be a two-needled variant of single-leaf pinyon from chemical and genetic evidence.

Occasional two-needled pinyons in northern Baja California are hybrids between single-leaf pinyon and Parry pinyon.

=== Prehistoric occurrence ===
&quot;Pinus monophylla&quot; has been studied with regard to prehistoric occurrence based upon fossil needles found in packrat middens and fossil pollen records. All three of these sub-types of single-needled pinyon have maintained distinctive ranges over the last 40,000 years, although the northerly species (&quot;Pinus monophylla&quot;) expanded greatly throughout Utah and Nevada since the end of the Pleistocene, 11,700 years ago. The southern California variety has been found to occur within Joshua Tree National Park throughout the last 47,000 years.

==Uses==
The edible seeds, pine nuts, are collected throughout its range; Native American of the Great Basin region commonly ate them. Various birds and mammals eat the seeds as well. The roasted cones are also edible.

Individuals may harvest the seed for personal use on BLM and Forest Service land.

Single-leaf pinyon is also cultivated as an ornamental tree for native plant, drought tolerant, and wildlife gardens, and for natural landscaping. It is used regionally as a Christmas tree. It is rarely seen in nurseries, because it is difficult to germinate.

===Deforestation===
During the mid-nineteenth century, many pinyon groves were cut down to make charcoal for ore-processing, threatening the traditional lifestyle of the Native Americans who depended on them for food. When the railroads penetrated these areas, imported coal supplanted locally produced charcoal.

Following the resulting re-establishment of pinyon woodlands after the charcoal era, many cattle ranchers became concerned that these woodlands provided decreased livestock forage in grazing rangeland. Efforts to clear these woodlands, often using a surplus battleship chain dragged between two bulldozers, peaked in the 1950s, but were subsequently abandoned when no long term forage increase resulted. The habitat destruction of large areas of Pinyon woodlands in the interests of mining and cattle ranching is seen by some as an act of ecological and cultural vandalism.

==In culture==
In 1959, it was designated Nevada&#x27;s state tree, later to be joined by the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine. Its description is attributed to American politician and explorer John C. FrÃ©mont.

<doc id="1291742" wikidata="Q7148023" url="?curid=1291742" title="Patriot Party (1970s)">
<text>The Patriot Party was a socialist organization of the early 1970s in the United States that organized poor, rural whites in the Appalachian South and Pacific Northwest. The party was formed after a split with the Young Patriots Organization. The YPO&#x27;s membership was drawn from street gangs of Appalachian whites in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois; it became politicized after working with the Young Lords, an ethnic Puerto Rican gang, and the African-American Black Panther Party.

==Founding==
The Patriot Party was founded in 1970 after infighting among members of the leftist Young Patriots Organization in Chicago. The group sought to improve the condition of disadvantaged whites, particularly recent immigrants, drug-users, the unemployed, welfare-recipients, blue-collar workers, and &quot;dislocated hillbillies&quot; who had left Appalachia.

The Patriot Party was a member of the original Rainbow Coalition, formed by Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party and others to create a broad-based, multi-racial political coalition. It formed after the United Front Against Fascism conference held in Oakland, California, in 1969. The coalition included the Young Lords, the Brown Berets and I Wor Kuen. Hampton&#x27;s intention was to have multi-ethnic gangs working together to accomplish peaceful solutions, rather than battling each other.

==Strategies==
The Patriot Party borrowed strategies of community organizing from the Black Panthers. For instance, they established a Free Breakfast for Children program. They established &quot;liberation schools&quot; to teach their ideology to children. The Eugene, Oregon, chapter, location of the University of Oregon, garnered much community support with its &quot;Free Lumber&quot; program. At this time in the Northwest, some poor people still relied on wood-stoves for cooking and heating, and cheap wood was hard to come by.

The Patriot Party believed that whites would abandon racist beliefs after identifying the capitalist system as their true enemy.

===Use of the Confederate flag===
Despite the Confederate flag&#x27;s association with white supremacism, the Patriot Party used it as a symbol. In addition to easy access at military surplus stores, the flag was used, according to Amy Sonnie and James Tracy, &quot;as a symbol of southern poor people&#x27;s revolt against the owning class&quot;. Buttons with the slogan &quot;Resurrect John Brown&quot; â a reference to the avowed abolitionist â were also commonly used. Pamphlets contained slogans such as &quot;The South will rise again, only this time with the North and all the oppressed people of the world.&quot;

==Downfall and legacy==
In 1970, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested the entire central committee of the Patriot Party and charged them with various felonies. They later dropped the charges, but, by the mid-1970s, the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO program had effectively suppressed the organization.

The group was also strongly opposed by far-right white militias.

In 1982, the civil rights activist Jesse Jackson adopted the name of &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; for organizing multi-ethnic groups to support and vote for liberal (generally Democratic) candidates for public office, in order to strengthen minority voices by acting in collaboration.

<text>Anders Erik LimpÃ¡r (; born 24 September 1965) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Limpar featured for the clubs IF Brommapojkarna, Young Boys, Cremonese, Arsenal, Everton, Birmingham City, AIK, Colorado Rapids and DjurgÃ¥rdens IF during a career that spanned between 1981 and 2002.

A full international between 1987 and 1996, Limpar was capped 58 times by Sweden, scoring 6 goals altogether. He represented Sweden at the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 1990 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1992, as well as the 1994 FIFA World Cup where Sweden finished third.

In 1991, he was awarded Guldbollen as Sweden&#x27;s best footballer of the year.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Solna with Hungarian roots, Limpar started playing football in Brommapojkarna, famous for its production of footballing talent. He then played for Ãrgryte, joining in the wake of its sensational Swedish championship title in 1985. Limpar quickly became one of the hottest properties in Swedish football, and as so he was offered the chance to journey to Switzerland with Bern club Young Boys. He followed this up in a one-season spell in Italy with Cremonese during the 1989â90 season. That season Limpar was named Serie A&#x27;s third best foreign player behind Diego Maradona and Lothar MatthÃ¤us.

===Arsenal===
His club career peaked when he signed for Arsenal on 8 July 1990 from Cremonese for Â£1m. Limpar quickly impressed in the Makita Tournament at Wembley and made his League debut in the 3â0 win at Wimbledon 25 August 1990. He went on to win the league title in the 1990â91 season. Limpar was also involved in the brawl against Manchester United 20 October 1990 and scored the only goal of the game. He played a particularly notable part in the 1990â91 season, scoring some important goals, and impressing in his first season with exciting wing play and crowd-pleasing displays. These included a hat-trick against Coventry City in a 6â1 win on the final day of the league season, by which time Arsenal were already champions. He managed a total of 13 goals that season, with 11 of them coming in the league.

He won the GuldbollenSweden&#x27;s Player of the Year awardin 1991.

In the season 1991â92, Limpar was in and out of the side. A jaw injury kept him out for several weeks but he still netted some spectacular goals including a 40 yard chip in Arsenals 4â0 win over Liverpool on 20 April 1992. A succession of knocks hampered him the following season, and he sat on the sidelines injured for Arsenal&#x27;s 1993 wins in both the League and the FA Cups. He and manager George Graham eventually fell out and with his contract due to come to an end in May 1994, Limpar, who was seeking a new deal at the club, was not offered one by Graham. Limpar played his last match with Arsenal against Southampton 19 March 1994. Limpar scored 20 goals from 116 appearances for Arsenal where he was popular with the fans, particularly for his performances in the title winning season.

===Everton===
On transfer deadline day in March 1994, Limpar transferred to Everton for Â£1.6 million. Limpar has revealed how he told reporters on the day he signed for Arsenal 1990, that he supported Everton.

He made his debut for Everton in a home defeat (1â0 to Tottenham Hotspur) on 26 March 1994. Limpar won a crucial penalty for Everton in the final day victory over Wimbledon in 1994, which preserved Everton&#x27;s Premiership status.

Whilst playing for the toffees he won the FA Cup for the first time in 1995. Limpar went on to play a vital role in the Cup final at Wembley, with a run from inside his own half leading to Everton&#x27;s winning goal being scored by Paul Rideout. He also hit a memorable 50-yard reverse-pass which led to an Everton break-away that BBC commentator Barry Davies described as the &#x27;pass of the match&#x27;. He also won the 1995 FA Charity Shield with Everton, but eventually fell out of favour at Goodison Park after 1995â96, making only two appearances for the club during the 1996â97 season.

===Birmingham City===
On 20 January 1997, Limpar was signed by Birmingham City for a fee of Â£100,000. He made his league debut on 1 February 1997, in a 2â1 away defeat against Bolton Wanderers. The move proved to be unfruitful, as he made only four appearances, before the club later ended his stay in April 1997.

===Later career===
Moving back to Sweden on a free transfer to AIK in the summer of 1997, he won the Allsvenskan title in 1998. After two years in Stockholm, he signed for Major League Soccer side Colorado Rapids in February 1999 where he stayed until November 2000. He then returned to Sweden to sign for DjurgÃ¥rdens IF. However he failed to make an appearance for them and shortly went on to IF Brommapojkarna, where he started his club career. He eventually retired from the game in March 2001 at the age of 35, due to persistent injuries.

At the age of 56 Anders made a comeback for Hede IK in the Swedish Division 5 and scored a goal from half the football field.

==International career==
In total, Limpar won 58 caps for Sweden, scoring 6 goals between 1987 and 1996. He was a member of one of the most successful Sweden squads ever, the team that finished third at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. However, he did not have a large role during the tournament, making just one substitute appearance, in the 3rd-place match. He also represented Sweden at the 1988 Summer Olympics, 1990 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 1992.

==Coaching career==
Limpar began coaching the youth team at DjurgÃ¥rdens IF. He was later appointed assistant manager for the Swedish second division team Sollentuna United. In October 2008, aged 43, he played a one-off game for Sollentuna United&#x27;s reserve side in the position of left back.

==Personal life==
After retiring from football in 2001, Limpar opened a bar, &quot;The Limp Bar&quot;, in central Stockholm, although it has since closed. In 2012 Limpar, together with colleague Mikael Crona, founded Swedish company Super Lock which produces plastic boxes. He currently is the CEO of betting site BestBetToday.com.

<doc id="1291750" wikidata="Q1759435" url="?curid=1291750" title="Use Once and Destroy">
<text>Use Once and Destroy is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Superjoint Ritual, released on May 21, 2002. The guitar and bass work was done by Phil Anselmo and Eyehategod&#x27;s Jimmy Bower. Drumming was performed by Joe Fazzio. For touring bass duties, the band recruited Hank Williams III. Anselmo did not want to play bass live because he wanted to focus mainly on singing.

&quot;Use Once and Destroy&quot; is a slightly different approach to music than the work of Pantera, one of Anselmo&#x27;s other bands. It has been described as a mix of hardcore punk and sludge metal. AllMusic called it &quot;some of the most intense heavy thrash metal to be released in 2002&quot;.

The album was re-released in 2006 through Sanctuary / Mayan Records, featuring bonus tracks.

On May 20, 2022, Revolver Magazine respectively reissued the album on a 2LP vinyl cover to celebrate its 20th-anniversary milestone, as well as their second follow-up album, &quot;A Lethal Dose of American Hatred&quot;. The 20th-anniversary edition art covers were designed by Child Bite lead vocalist Shawn Knight.

==Music videos==
&quot;Fuck Your Enemy&quot; had a music video, directed by Jim Van Bebber. With its short song length, it found considerable airplay on &quot;Uranium&quot; throughout 2003. The black and white video begins by passing a door with a sign that reads &quot;Hippies use side door&quot;. It then features the band performing in Phil&#x27;s studio, Nosferatu&#x27;s Lair, with its walls covered in music posters and logos. Brief shots have the band humorously playing air guitar and drums before reverting to actual instrument performance footage. The song title would be censored as &quot;F*** Your Enemy&quot;.

&quot;The Alcoholik&quot; also had a music video, directed by Jim Van Bebber. The video starts with a couple of various shots of the band playing along with the song vigorously. Superjoint and Eyehategod guitarist and Down drummer Jimmy Bower appears as an actor by drinking numerous couple of beer bottles while watching NASCAR on television. It then proceeds as Bower runs to the toilet by breaking the door down, signifying the &quot;PINEAL GLAND&quot; meter as full. The process continues while Bower goes back to drinking alcoholic beverages and smoking cigarettes while on the couch as various shots of Bower were made outside the home. Two unidentified actors came in to force Bower to drink more while the music plays. Various posters and logos were used, including the Confederate flag at the end of the music video.

<text>DÃ¡niel Gyurta (; born 4 May 1989) is a Hungarian former competitive swimmer who mainly competed in the 200-metre breaststroke. In 2016, Gyurta became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), he is a member of the European Olympic Committees (EOC) Athletes&#x27; Commission since 2013 and a member of the Athletes Commission since 2016.

==Biography==
Gyurta was born in Budapest. When he was 15 years old, he won a silver medal (with 2.10.80) in the men&#x27;s 200-metre breaststroke at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

His coaches are SÃ¡ndor SzÃ©les, Ferenc KovÃ¡cshegyi and BalÃ¡zs Virth.
On 12 August 2008 he set an Olympic record in the preliminaries of the 200-metre breaststroke at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. His record was broken one day later by Kitajima in the semi-finals. Gyurta finished fifth in the final.

At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships he won gold medal in 200Â m breaststroke, edging out Eric Shanteau in the last meters. He was named Hungarian Sportsman of the year for this achievement.

Two years later Gyurta retained the gold medal at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships, thus becoming the second man to defend the world title on 200 metre breaststroke after David Wilkie of Great Britain, who won the first two world titles, in 1973 and 1975.

At the 2012 London Olympics he won the gold medal and set a new world record for the 200 m breaststroke.
After the race, he offered a replica of his Olympic medal to the parents of his former competitor Alexander Dale Oen in tribute to him, a gesture much appreciated by Dale&#x27;s family. Dale had died on 30 April 2012, a few months before the Games. Later, Gyurta received the international Fair Play Award from UNESCO, in respect of his medal tribute of a fallen fellow breaststroker: Alexander Dale Oen.

<doc id="1291763" wikidata="Q624538" url="?curid=1291763" title="Jawbreaker (band)">
<text>Jawbreaker is an American punk rock band that was initially active from 1986 to 1996, and reunited in 2017. The band is considered to be extremely influential to the 1990s emo and punk genre with their &quot;poetic take on hardcore.&quot; Their influence on the punk scene has led some critics to label Jawbreaker as the best punk rock band of the 1990s.

Lead vocalist and guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach, bassist Chris Bauermeister, and drummer Adam Pfahler formed the band while students at New York University, later relocating to Los Angeles where they released their debut album &quot;Unfun&quot; (1990) through independent record label Shredder Records. Relocating again to San Francisco the next year, they released 1992&#x27;s &quot;Bivouac&quot; through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label.

Schwarzenbach&#x27;s charismatic, frustrated, and personal lyrics helped establish him as a cult idol, even as he underwent surgery to remove painful, voice-threatening polyps from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with Nirvana in 1993 and released &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with DGC Records and released 1995&#x27;s &quot;Dear You&quot;, but its more polished production and smooth vocals caused significant backlash from the band&#x27;s core audience. Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker&#x27;s dissolution in 1996 and Schwarzenbach had repeatedly stated that a reunion would never happen. However, the band announced a reunion in April 2017, and they are currently in the process of making the follow-up to &quot;Dear You&quot;.

Following the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including Jets to Brazil and Whysall Lane. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally charting pop-punk and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker&#x27;s sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print &quot;Dear You&quot; from DGC&#x27;s parent company Geffen Records and re-released it to positive reviews. Remastered versions of the rest of the band&#x27;s catalog have since been released.

==History==

=== 1986â1990: Formation and &quot;Unfun&quot; ===
Prior to forming Jawbreaker, Blake Schwarzenbach and Adam Pfahler were childhood friends in Santa Monica, California and classmates at Crossroads High School. In 1986 they moved to New York City to attend New York University and decided to start a band. Seeking a bassist, they responded to a flyer posted on campus by Chris Bauermeister. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just this Xeroxed thing&quot;, Pfahler later recalled, &quot;It was something he had drawn, like a poster. It was all colored and it named all the right bands.&quot; The trio began practicing together at Giant Studios on Sixth Avenue, with Schwarzenbach on guitar and Pfahler on drums. &quot;It was just us, trying to figure each other out in that hourly room for a while&quot;, recalls Schwarzenbach, &quot;We went through &quot;a lot&quot; of incarnations before we sounded anything like the band we became. I am glad we didn&#x27;t play live [very much then], because I had to go through my hardcore phase.&quot; They practiced with several singers and went through several names during this time, eventually settling on the name Rise.

In the fall of 1987 Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister took time off from college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue Rise, adding Bauermeister&#x27;s childhood friend Jon Liu on lead vocals. This changed, however, when Schwarzenbach wrote and sang &quot;Shield Your Eyes&quot; for the band&#x27;s demo. It was the first recording on which he sang, and he later noted that it &quot;kind of defined where we would go as a band&quot;. According to Liu, &quot;That was the song where everything worked. The vocal arrangements. The lyrics. It was a perfect piece. But to my detriment, I kind of bristled against it. I was like, &#x27;This is amazing, and I don&#x27;t think I can do &quot;anything&quot; like this. The band soon changed their name to Jawbreaker and Schwarzenbach, Pfahler, and Bauermeister decided to continue as a trio with Schwarzenbach on vocals. Bauermeister was given the task of informing Liu that he was no longer in the band, which proved awkward since the two were roommates. &quot;I am cool with it now,&quot; reflected Liu in 2010, &quot;It was to everybody&#x27;s benefit. But at the time, there was some bitterness.&quot;

&quot;Shield Your Eyes&quot; was the first Jawbreaker song to be released, on the 7&quot; vinyl compilation album &quot;The World&#x27;s in Shreds Volume Two&quot; on independent record label Shredder Records. This was followed by a single for the song &quot;Busy&quot; and the &quot;Whack &amp; Blite 7&quot; E.P.&quot; in 1989. In total Jawbreaker wrote almost 20 songs in 1988 and 1989, many of which appeared on compilations and split singles over the next two years. The band played their first show March 16, 1989 at Club 88 in Los Angeles and recorded their debut album, &quot;Unfun&quot;, in two days in Venice in January 1990. Released through Shredder, its pop-punk sound was distinguished by Schwarzenbach&#x27;s lyrical and vocal intensity.

In the summer of 1990 Jawbreaker embarked on the &quot;Fuck 90&quot; tour with Econochrist, which proved to be a grueling experience that briefly broke up the band. &quot;It was roughly two months, in the summer, for a totally unknown band&quot;, according to Schwarzenbach. &quot;Of that tour, we probably had six rad shows. Then there were maybe 25 utterly forgettable metal-club-in-Florida-type shows.&quot; Bauermeister stopped speaking to Pfahler and Schwarzenbach when the tour reached Canada, with several weeks still to go. By the conclusion of the tour, tensions between the members had risen to the point where they announced the band&#x27;s breakup. Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister returned to New York University to finish their degrees, and rarely spoke to each other.

=== 1991â1992: Relocation and &quot;Bivouac&quot; ===
Pfahler quickly regretted the breakup, while Schwarzenbach and Bauermeister eventually reconciled in New York. The trio decided to continue with Jawbreaker and relocate to San Francisco, where they had already earned the recognition of local acts Econochrist and Samiam. In 1991 they moved into an apartment complex in the Mission District; Pfahler and Schwarzenbach shared an apartment across the hall from Bauermeister, J Church&#x27;s Lance Hahn and roadie Raul Reyes. They recorded their second album, &quot;Bivouac&quot;, with recording engineer Billy Anderson, and it was released in 1992 through the local labels Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label. Pfahler has described the album as &quot;varied and ambitious&quot;, noting that it &quot;took ages to finish&quot; and &quot;I think we were trying to prove something with that record. We were definitely stretching out.&quot;

By the time of &quot;Bivouac&quot;&#x27;s release Schwarzenbach had developed a polyp on his throat, causing him to lose his voice onstage. As the band drove across the United States to fly from New York City to begin a European tour, he began to suffer serious vocal problems. Though the condition caused him great pain while singing, threatened his voice, and was potentially fatal should the polyp burst or lodge in his throat, the band decided to do the European tour anyway. &quot;That period seemed really arduous for me because I was so physically challenged by singing&quot;, recalls Schwarzenbach, &quot;Every day was full of dread, having to stand up there and see what would happen. But it was too late. We had to play or else we would have bankrupted our friends.&quot; By the time the band reached Ireland, Schwarzenbach&#x27;s condition had worsened and the tour was put on hold while he had surgery to remove the polyp. The tour resumed a week later. In August 1992, Jawbreaker was noticed by the magazine &quot;Spin&quot; when the magazine published a story called &quot;California Screamin&#x27;&quot;, which documented the East Bay punk scene.

=== 1993â1994: &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; and signing to DGC ===
Upon returning to San Francisco, Pfahler and Schwarzenbach were homeless and slept in the band&#x27;s touring van for a brief period. They soon found new residences, with Schwarzenbach moving to nearby Oakland where he began writing lyrics for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot;. Jawbreaker travelled to Chicago in May 1993 and recorded the bulk of the album with engineer Steve Albini, though the album&#x27;s production is officially credited on liner notes and packaging to Fluss, Albini&#x27;s cat. They recorded three additional tracks with Billy Anderson in San Francisco that August, and the album was released in early 1994 through Tupelo/Communion. Music journalist Andy Greenwald and &quot;Alternative Press&quot;&#x27; Trevor Kelley both cite it as the album most beloved by the band&#x27;s fans. &quot;&quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; is arguably Jawbreaker&#x27;s best album,&quot; writes Greenwald, &quot;but it is also far and away its most loved, the best example of Schwarzenbach&#x27;s innate ability to marry the boozy, bluesy regretfulness of the Replacements with the loose, seat-of-the-pants attitude of Gilman Street punk.&quot; As dubbed copies of the album began to circulate in late summer 1993, the band began to earn a devoted fanbase.
In October 1993, prior to &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot;&#x27;s release, Jawbreaker were asked to open for Nirvana on six dates of their &quot;In Utero&quot; tour. Fans bristled against this, wary that it would result in Jawbreakerâa beloved independent bandâsigning to major label DGC Records, whom Nirvana were contracted to. &quot;I think we were fortunate [with &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot;]&quot;, recalls Schwarzenbach, &quot;But we &quot;still&quot; got some flack. Even at that point, there were people who didn&#x27;t think we were especially punk-rock, as some people practiced it. I don&#x27;t think there was any major pushback, though, until we did the Nirvana tour. That&#x27;s &quot;officially&quot; when it started.&quot; According to Pfahler: &quot;People really came down on us for going on tour with Nirvana. They really saw it as, &#x27;Okay, here we go. This is the first step. The next thing that happens is that someone from the label sees them and they get snapped up.&#x27; Which is kind of what happened.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; in February 1994, Jawbreaker received contract offers from major record labels. Though they had already decided to break up following the album&#x27;s supporting tours due to tiredness and frustration, the band decided to consider the offers, partly due to the major label successes of their peers Green Day and Jawbox. They met with a number of labels over the course of the year, narrowing their options to Warner Bros. Records, Capitol Records, and DGC. Rumors spread throughout the Bay Area suggesting Jawbreaker had signed to major label, and in a 1994 concert where Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong was among the audience, Schwarzenbach confronted the major label gossip, confirming the approaches by representatives but promised to never sell out. Nonetheless, the band signed to DGC in a one million-dollar deal, due in part to the relationship they had developed with A&amp;R representative Mark Kates who they had met on the Nirvana tour. Fans and key figures in the punk rock community were quick to denounce the band for the move. In an interview for Ben Weasel&#x27;s &quot;Panic Button&quot; zine following the Nirvana tour, Schwarzenbach had stated flatly that Jawbreaker was not interested in signing to a major record label. In response to the signing, Weasel took the band to task in a column for &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; accompanied by a photo depicting him eating his own hat, which he had promised to do if the band ever signed to a major.

=== 1995â1996: &quot;Dear You&quot; and breakup ===
Jawbreaker began recording their major-label debut, &quot;Dear You&quot;, in February 1995 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California with Rob Cavallo, who had produced Green Day&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Dookie&quot; the previous year. Recording sessions lasted two months and resulted in disenchantment and tension within the band, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach. After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent from the rest of the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even go&quot;, recalled Bauermeister in 2010, &quot;I just hung out at home with my wife. I was already trying to separate myself from the band, while Blake became more of the major force.&quot; With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record&#x27;s production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the mix. According to Cavallo, &quot;Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently. Then, to me, I thought those songs could benefit from some precision.&quot;
In the months leading up to the album&#x27;s release, a number of music publications positioned Jawbreaker as the next stars of the Bay Area punk scene, sometimes referring to them as &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s Green Day&quot;. When &quot;Dear You&quot; was released in September 1995, however, its polished production and clear vocals strongly divided the band&#x27;s fanbase. &quot;[&quot;Dear You&quot;]&#x27;s production glistened and gleamed,&quot; says Greenwald, &quot;Schwarzenbach&#x27;s voice was sanded and smoothed, and the songs were mellow, introspective affairs. The reaction was harshâthose who had entrusted their emotional lives to Schwarzenbach, had viewed him as a tattered, secular priest to lay their burdens on, felt betrayed.&quot; Ben Weasel was so displeased with the album, particularly the sound of Schwarzenbach&#x27;s singing, that he wrote Pfahler a letter detailing his complaints with it. Despite a music video in rotation to support the single &quot;Fireman,&quot; sales of &quot;Dear You&quot; were poor, and only sold 40,000 copies in the US.

As the band toured in support of the album, audience reaction toward the new material was either lukewarm or outright negative. &quot;I have never seen anything like thatâbefore or since&quot;, said Kates, &quot;There was a point where they were headlining the Roxy and there were kids sitting on the floor, with their backs to the stage, when they were playing songs from &quot;Dear You&quot;. I&#x27;m not making that up. If you were to try to explain that to somebody now, it would make no sense.&quot; Jawbreaker continued touring in 1996, opening for the Foo Fighters that spring, but audience reception did not improve. Samiam&#x27;s Sergie Loobkoff cites a show at The Warfield in San Francisco as a turning point: &quot;That is when I knew they were &quot;definitely&quot; going to break up. It was their hometown; they had put out the big major-label record. But then you&#x27;re looking around and it was like no one cared.&quot;

Attitudes between the band members continued to sour, particularly between Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach, who took to traveling in separate vans. Tensions came to a head in Salem, Oregon, culminating in a fistfight between the two which spilled out of the van and onto the sidewalk. &quot;I remember just calling Blake a &#x27;fucking prima donna&#x27; and a &#x27;stupid son of a bitch who thinks it&#x27;s all about him.&#x27; Just letting it all out&quot;, says Bauermeister, &quot;It definitely put a wedge between us.&quot; On returning to San Francisco, the band called a meeting and decided to break up, though Pfahler was resistant to the idea. Jawbreaker officially announced their breakup on July 4, 1996.

=== 1997â2016: Post-Jawbreaker projects ===

Following the band&#x27;s breakup, Schwarzenbach moved to Brooklyn where he DJ&#x27;d and wrote freelance video game reviews for websites. He formed and fronted Jets to Brazil from 1997 to 2003, combining Britpop influences, piano ballads, and stark lyrics. Fans and critics, however, still associated him primarily with Jawbreaker and did not warm to his new project: &quot;Schwarzenbach was so adored for what he had done that few were willing to allow him to gracefully move on&quot;, writes Greenwald, &quot;Jets to Brazil, though popular, has received unspeakably scathing reviews, boiling with the bitterness usually reserved for a cheating lover.&quot;

Bauermeister, meanwhile, returned to his job at the toy store he had worked at before Jawbreaker had begun touring. &quot;I had been on tour, playing in front of thousands of people&quot;, he later remarked, &quot;And here I was, working as a toy shop clerk. I was devastated.&quot; He eventually returned to music, joining the Chicago pop-punk band Horace Pinker from 1999 to 2001, performing on their 2000 EP &quot;Copper Regret&quot; before forming the short-lived Shorebirds and Mutoid Men with Mattie Jo Canino, formerly of Latterman. Bauermeister additionally recorded bass on RVIVR&#x27;s 2014 EP &quot;Bicker &amp; Breathe&quot;, a band also fronted by Canino.

Pfahler remained in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District, where he opened the Lost Weekend Video store with Jawbreaker&#x27;s tour manager Christy Colcord. He played in J Church with Bauermeister&#x27;s old roommate Lance Hahn from 1998 to 2002, then in Whysall Lane until 2006. He continued to release Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, issuing the live album &quot;Live 4/30/96&quot; in 1999 and the compilation album &quot;Etc.&quot; in 2002. In 2004 he licensed the publishing rights to &quot;Dear You&quot;âwhich had become an out-of-print collector&#x27;s item, often selling for more than twice its retail price on online auction sitesâfrom DGC&#x27;s parent company Geffen Records, and re-released it to positive critical response.

In August 2007 filmmakers Keith Schieron and Tim Irwin began work on a documentary film about Jawbreaker, having previously made the 2005 Minutemen documentary &quot;We Jam Econo&quot;. All three band members were convinced to take part in the film and met at a San Francisco studio, the first time they had all met together in eleven years. &quot;A couple years ago, I began to have a really nice time with the memory of Jawbreaker,&quot; said Schwarzenbach, &quot;I just thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s good, people finally get it.&#x27; It was nice. So I was happy with the idea. I wanted to do it.&quot; Bauermeister was unsure about seeing Schwarzenbach again, but stated that &quot;there was a moment when I realized that my resentment was not so much through Blake, but what he had come to represent in my mind. So I told him.&quot; The filmmakers had the necessary instruments and equipment set up in the studio and invited the band to play, which they did, performing &quot;Bivouac&quot;, &quot;Condition Oakland&quot;, and &quot;Parabola&quot;. The performance was photographed, and an audio recording was made through the sound board, but the band chose not to film the session &quot;out of both respect for the sanctity of the moment and fear that we&#x27;d suck.&quot; In February 2011 Schieron and Irwin shot footage in Los Angeles, including interviews with Jon Liu and the band&#x27;s former tour manager Anthony &quot;Nino&quot; Newman. There was talk of reuniting the band with &quot;Dear You&quot; producer Rob Cavallo, but this did not take place. Bauermeister and Schwarzenbach did not speak again for some time after the filming in San Francisco. Pfahler mentioned in a May 2015 update on the band&#x27;s official Twitter account that he had &quot;just met with Keith Schieron about the Jawbreaker documentary. We&#x27;re interviewing editors to take it from here.&quot;

Schwarzenbach spent time teaching English at Hunter College in New York City and briefly fronted The Thorns of Life from 2008 to 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Punknews 8/23/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He currently plays in the band Forgetters. Bauermeister lives in Olympia, Washington and performs in the Mutoid Men. Pfahler still resides in San Francisco, where he continues to run Lost Weekend Video and reissue Jawbreaker material through Blackball Records; in 2010 he released a remastered version of &quot;Unfun&quot;, and plans to remaster and re-release &quot;Bivouac&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; over the next few years.

Rumors persisted of a Jawbreaker reunion, but they had been continually dispelled by the band members. Pfahler said that he &quot;would do it in a heartbeat&quot;, while Bauermeister had agreed that &quot;Adam and I would do it at the drop of a hat. But I don&#x27;t think Blake is anywhere near [ready].&quot; For his part, Schwarzenbach had expressed that he did not feel physically capable of singing the songs and doing them justice: &quot;If I felt I was in a good enough place, I think we could have a really fun and successful tour. We could also pay a lot of bills, which would be profoundly helpful. But it&#x27;s always the same story. Something is fucking broken in me so that when it&#x27;s like, &#x27;A lot of people want to hear you,&#x27; I just think, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t want to do that.

=== 2017âpresent: Reunion and possible fifth studio album===
On April 19, 2017, it was announced that Jawbreaker would reunite as the headliner of the final night of Riot Fest in September 2017. Although the Riot Fest appearance was initially announced as a one-off reunion show, Jawbreaker performed together for the first time in 21 years at the Ivy Room in Albany on August 3, 2017, opening for Monsula; this was held as a private gig and mostly attended by friends of the band. They played their second reunion show at The Rickshaw Stop in San Francisco on August 12, 2017. On November 28, 2017, Jawbreaker performed their first post-Riot Fest show at the Olympia Film Society to benefit the Thurston County Food Bank.
Coinciding with the band&#x27;s reunion, the long-in the works documentary &quot;Don&#x27;t Break Down: A Film About Jawbreaker&quot; was premiered on August 11, 2017 in San Francisco, and screened at Nitehawk Cinema in New York City on August 31. On the night of the documentary&#x27;s screening, frontman Blake Schwarzenbach participated in a Q&amp;A session, where he hinted at more shows and added that there was &quot;95% chance of a New York show.&quot; He explained, &quot;If we aren&#x27;t burned alive in Chicago, we wanna do more, and not have to have people make it a destination and pay a ton of money to see us.&quot; Schwarzenbach also stated that Jawbreaker was &quot;trying to&quot; write new material. Also coinciding with the reunion, Jawbreaker&#x27;s first demo from 1989 was remastered and remixed, and re-released on their Bandcamp page.

On January 9, 2018, the band announced a series of sold-out shows. In January, the band played two shows in San Francisco, three shows at Brooklyn Steel in February (making it their first shows in New York in 25 years), and in March, two shows at the Hollywood Palladium (their first shows in Los Angeles in 22 years). They performed in Austin, Texas with Lemuria and A Giant Dog in July. The band played a 2 night residency in Portland, Oregon at the Crystal Ballroom with Swearin&#x27; and 3 nights in their native San Francisco at The Fillmore with Street Eaters and Dirty Denim in August and October respectively. On November 4, the band played a sold out show at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago with Naked Raygun and Smoking Popes.

In a March 2018 interview on the Going Off Track podcast, Schwarzenbach confirmed that, in the summer, Jawbreaker would work on what might result in the band&#x27;s first album since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Dear You&quot;. He explained, &quot;Our summer is just gonna be trying to write, jam. What we really wanna do is just riff out and see what comes. I&#x27;m spending the next month writing at home, and then we&#x27;re gonna converge in San Francisco and go in a studio and see what happens.&quot; Schwarzenbach also noted the record would be more indebted to &quot;Bivouac&quot;. 
Jawbreaker was one of the headliners of the Upstream Music Festival in Seattle on June 2, 2018 where they played &quot;Shield Your Eyes&quot;, the first song the band ever wrote with Schwarzenbach on vocals and the opening song on &quot;Bivouac&quot;, for the first time in 22 years. The band also announced several shows in Portland, Austin, Coney Island and Asbury Park.

During a three night residency at The Fillmore in October 2018 in San Francisco, the band performed &quot;Gemini&quot;, a song written between the release of &quot;Dear You&quot; and their break up which was never officially recorded and debuted &quot;Black Art&quot;, a new arrangement of an unreleased song formerly by Schwarzenbach&#x27;s previous band The Thorns of Life.

In January 2019, the band announced their first tour in 23 years beginning in Boston on March 22, and ending in New Jersey on March 30. The band additionally announced summer performances at Groezrock, the West Coast leg of the Warped Tour, Primavera Sound and a performance in England at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire and Manchester&#x27;s Albert Hall. During the Q&amp;A portion of a screening of their documentary &quot;Don&#x27;t Break Down&quot; at Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn on March 25, the band stated that they have been toying around with an idea of putting out a new 7&quot; in the near future, however writing has been slow as Bauermeister lives in Olympia, WA, Pfahler lives in San Francisco and Schwarzenbach resides in Brooklyn. The band embarked on their first European tour in 25 years with support on 2 dates by Beach Slang in April 2019 concluding on May 31 in Barcelona.

==Music, lyrics and influence==
Many of Schwarzenbach&#x27;s lyrics were rooted in his specific concerns, often lifted directly from his journal. This focus on personal, immediate matters, coupled with descriptive imagery and word choices, attracted listeners to Schwarzenbach and made him a cult idol in rock and roll circles. &quot;The attraction then was to the songwriter,&quot; writes Greenwald in &quot;Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo&quot;, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t the song that the listeners related to, it was the singer.&quot; Jawbreaker&#x27;s tour manager Christy Colcord recalls that &quot;Most of [the fans] hovered around Blake because he was, like, this poet to them. It was all these people who really wanted their heartbreak validated by someone who could understandâor wanted to drink whiskey with them.&quot; The idolization of Schwarzenbach came to be described as the Cult of Blake. According to rock critic Chris Ryan, &quot;In terms of contemporary music, the Cult of Blake is probably matched only by the Cult of Morrissey&quot;.
Before &quot;Bivouac&quot;&#x27;s release, Jawbreaker recorded the song &quot;Kiss the Bottle&quot; for a Mission District-themed compilation of vinyl singles titled &quot;17 Reasons: The Mission District&quot;. It was the last song they recorded before Schwarzenbach&#x27;s throat surgery, and his vocals on the recording are mottled and choked. Greenwald cites the track as &quot;one of [Jawbreaker&#x27;s] seminal and best-loved songs&quot;, calling it &quot;sludgy and churning, a working-class anthem with a steady, proletarian heart&quot;. With lyrics profiling a pair of drunks outside a Mission District liquor store, Kiss the Bottle,&#x27; more than any other song, captures the sensitive boy machismo that drew (and continues to draw) male listeners to the altar of Schwarzenbach. With its fictional scrim, &#x27;Kiss the Bottle&#x27; functions like a country song: the emotional impact is heightened by the specificity, not lessened. &#x27;Kiss the Bottle&#x27; is Kerouac; it&#x27;s Bukowski. It&#x27;s the allure of giving into despair, to doing the wrong thing and at least succeeding at that.&quot; The song has been cited as a favorite and influence of Jim Ward of At the Drive-In and Sparta, and by Ron Richards, editor of the successful zine &quot;Muddle&quot;.

Jawbreaker had a sizable impact on the second wave of emo, with bands such as The Get Up Kids, Braid, and Texas Is the Reason citing the band as an influence or a personal favorite. Numerous other bands and artists have cited Jawbreaker as an influence, including Rise Against, Dashboard Confessional, Title Fight, Eve 6, Drug Church, and Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio.

Public interest in Jawbreaker increased in the years following their breakup, due in part to chart-toppings acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance publicly citing Jawbreaker as an influence. In 2003 Dying Wish Records released the tribute album &quot;Bad Scene, Everyone&#x27;s Fault: Jawbreaker Tribute&quot;, featuring 18 acts including Fall Out Boy, Bayside, Face to Face, and Sparta performing cover versions of Jawbreaker songs. Jawbreaker is featured in the 2017 documentary &quot;Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk&quot;.

Their musical style has been primarily described as punk rock, and has been self-identified by the band&#x27;s members as such. Their sound has also been labeled under the punk subgenres such as pop-punk, emo, hardcore punk, post-hardcore. Schwarzenbach has stated that Jawbreaker experimented with heavier punk styles in early phases of the band.

<doc id="1291778" wikidata="Q3182732" url="?curid=1291778" title="John Whitby Allen">
<text>John Whitby Allen (July 2, 1913 â January 6, 1973) was a prominent American model railroader. He pioneered or developed several aspects of the hobby on his HO scale Gorre &amp; Daphetid model railroad in Monterey, California, popularizing them with numerous magazine articles and photographs starting in the 1940s. 

Allen was renowned for his skill at scratch building and creating scenery. He also pioneered the technique of weathering his models for a more realistic appearance. In addition to his superdetailing of locomotives, rolling stock, structures, and scenery, Allen was known for populating his model world with scale figures in humorous scenes. Other techniques Allen promoted were realistic train operation and the use of forced perspective to create the illusion of a model railroad layout larger than it really was.

== Early life ==
Born in Joplin, Missouri, Allen lost his father to typhoid fever when he was three; his mother died during the flu epidemic about nine years later. Allen lived with relatives in Missouri until attending school in Minnesota. While there, he developed rheumatic fever, and on the advice of a doctor, moved to California to live with an aunt and uncle. His health improved, but the rheumatic fever weakened his heart.

After completing high school, Allen attended UCLA, and joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). He became comfortable around military people, and later recruited servicemen to help run the Gorre &amp; Daphetid.

In 1934, Allen and his brother went to the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, and saw scale model trains in operation, and he was impressed. He was attending UCLA studying economics, but switched to art school, which he attended for three years, specializing in photography. There he acquired the skills that set his layout and model photography apart.

In 1935, John&#x27;s paternal grandparents died, leaving him about $1,900 ($ today), then the equivalent of a year&#x27;s salary for a middle-class man. John invested the money with the help of his brother, and in about 11 years, the value was such that he did not have to work. His investments, combined with a frugal lifestyle, resulted in a sum of over $500,000 at the time of his death.
After completing school, John and another student opened a photography business in the Westlake Park area of Los Angeles.

== World War II ==
Before World War II, Allen and his brother Andrew visited an uncle living near Oakland who had a model railroad. He became interested in working on it. 

When the U.S. entered the war, Andrew joined the military and John offered his services as a photo analyst. 

Allen came to Monterey, California, to visit his brother, and decided to stay. He opened a new photography shop on the main street with partner Weston Booth, and did a brisk business photographing servicemen. In 1946, John sold his business, invested the money, and retired.

== Model railroading ==
Allen said that he got into model railroading just before the end of the war. Due to a limited supply of hobby materials, he began building things from scratch. He spent a lot of time studying and observing railroads in operation, and how prototype equipment was built. Allen built models, then meticulously arranged and photographed them.

In July 1946, he published the first of many articles and photographs to appear in &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine: &quot;How to make realistic model photos.&quot; Another photo was used for the cover of the December 1947 issue of &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman.&quot; 

Over the next three decades, Allen produced many articles and photographs for prominent hobby magazines. His last feature article for a major model railroad magazine likely appeared in the March and April 1971 issues of &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman.&quot;

Allen also devised or inspired trends and ideas in the hobby. In 1948, his two-stall enginehouse took first award in the national model-railroading contest in the structures category. Wrote Westcott: &quot;It aroused comment because John had modeled pigeons and their evidences along the ridge of the roof. Pigeons and other animate detail, once considered un-acceptable in this hobby, were given another look; and many a modeler began to humanize his railroad. While &#x27;weathering&#x27; was not entirely new, the work of Allen and a few others in this period showed how effective it could be in adding atmosphere to otherwise very stiff-looking modelwork. This also created a trend.&quot;

Allen also devised &quot;Timesaver&quot;, a well-known model railroad switching puzzle.

=== Gorre &amp; Daphetid ===
Allen&#x27;s model railroad, the HO scale Gorre &amp; Daphetid, has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous model railroad.&quot; Allen built three versions, each larger than the last.

==== Early version ====
He moved into a house in 1946 and began construction of the first version of the Gorre &amp; Daphetid. (The name is a play on words; pronounced &quot;Gory and Defeated.&quot;) In 1953 he needed more space, and decided to move. He offered a railroad for sale, with free house. When no one was interested in buying the house with the railroad, he dismantled it. The original by G&amp;D was saved and incorporated into the final version, while other parts were given to friends.

==== Final version ====
Allen moved to his final house, chosen for its unfinished basement. He excavated the basement, poured a concrete floor and prepared it for construction of the final layout. He allocated about half the to the layout, with the remainder used as workshop and storage.

Allen built a scale model of the house to aid in planning, in addition to models of the layout he planned to build. His planning was very thorough. Early plans included the use of real water in scale rivers and lakes. Construction began in January 1954. One feature of the layout was Devil&#x27;s Gulch, a part of the basement not excavated, but shaped, with concrete poured over it. Allen constructed the layout almost completely by himself. He devoted the next 20 years to this project.

During this period, Allen revolutionized model railroading with realistic operations, lighting (including night lighting), and weathering of models. He used forced perspective to enhance the illusion of realism, and only allowed photography under his conditions.

== Death and fire ==
John Allen suffered at least one heart attack in the 1960s. As his health declined, he continued to work to complete the Gorre &amp; Daphetid. In a telephone conversation with Linn Westcott, he suggested that he would drive the last spike in the spring of 1973, and that Linn should come for a visit then. In 1972, he was already suggesting that things might not be going well, and wondering &quot;what to do with the railroad&quot; in letters to a friend. He suffered a fatal heart attack on the evening of January 6, 1973. 

=== Fire ===
Ten days after Allen died, some of his friends gathered for an operating session and discussion on the preservation of the railroad in accordance with Allen&#x27;s wishes. 

When they left, someone set a small gas furnace in the train room to 65Â Â°F. Allen had rarely used the furnace, because he liked to keep the house cool, or possibly because it was not vented correctly. He had covered it with tar paper. 

This caused a fire, investigators later determined, according to Linn Westcott&#x27;s book &quot;Model Railroading with John Allen.&quot; The fire was quickly reported and extinguished fast enough to save the house, but it destroyed the final, still-unfinished incarnation of Allen&#x27;s railroad. Linn Westcott was asked by John&#x27;s brother Andrew Allen to see whether the layout could be salvaged. They tried to save the &quot;French Gulch&quot; section, but it collapsed as they moved it after two hours of work.

The damage was mainly contained to the layout room, and the house was rehabilitated and sold. 

A few model railroad items attributed to Allen survive and have been authenticated.

== Legacy ==
The first wide public mention of Allen&#x27;s death was an obituary penned by editor Tony Koester in the March 1973 issue of &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman&quot;. &quot;John Allen was an institution, Although his material had appeared in print on countless occasions (the December 1947 issue of &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman&quot; featured a John Allen cover), reader enthusiasm for his well known HO scale Gorre &amp; Daphetid never wore down,&quot; Koester wrote. &quot;The hobby has lost an all-time great.&quot;

The April 1973 issue of &quot;Model Railroader&quot; magazine contained an obituary by editor Linn Westcott and a cover photo of Allen.

The January 2003 issue of &quot;Model Railroader&quot; contained a remembrance of him 30 years after his death.

Former &quot;Model Railroader&quot; editor Linn Westcott&#x27;s final book, entitled &quot;Model Railroading with John Allen&quot;, was published posthumously in 1981. Westcott died in 1980 while writing the book. It contained various quotes and photographs from Allen demonstrating his techniques.

There is a video about John Allen&#x27;s railroad by &quot;Sunday River Productions&quot; called &quot;The Gorre &amp; Daphetid&quot; with footage shot by Richard Reynolds with a small intro by Glenn Beier who also operated on the G&amp;D. Glenn Beier says &quot;it is the only motion picture ever made of the world&#x27;s most famous model railroad&quot;. Until February 2007, only a VHS copy of the video was for sale. Now both VHS and DVD versions are available.

<text> () is a traditional Norwegian main course dinner dish based on lamb ribs. is a festive dish typical to Western and Northern Norway, and is rapidly gaining popularity in other regions as well. This dish is largely associated with the celebration of Christmas and frequently paired with purÃ©ed rutabaga, sausages and potatoes, served with beer and akevitt.

==Preparation==
The preparation of uses a traditional method of food preservation utilising curing, drying and in some regions also smoking as a means of inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms. Although fresh lamb is available today, and frozen can be bought all year round, is still prepared both commercially and in private homes due to the flavour and maturing the preservation process gives to the meat.

In home preparation of , racks of lamb or mutton are cured in brine or coarse sea salt. Once sufficiently cured, and when the weather is cold enough, the racks are hung in a cool, dark, well ventilated place to dry. In some regions, particularly in parts of Hordaland and SunnmÃ¸re, the fresh racks are commonly smoked prior to drying. Traditionally this was done in order to prevent mould growth during the drying process.

Before cooking, the racks are separated into individual ribs by cutting between the bones. The ribs are then soaked in water so as to rinse out the salt and reconstitute the meat. Today is available in most supermarkets before Christmas, smoked or unsmoked, ready cut and sometimes also soaked, ready for cooking.
After soaking the ribs are steamed over a little water in a large saucepan. Usually, a grid of twigs of birch is placed in the bottom of the saucepan which will allow the meat to steam more than it is cooked.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word (literally: &#x27;stick meat&#x27;) is unclear. It may refer to the birch twigs that many use as a kind of steam grate in the pot. The word is also used in dialectal Norwegian in reference to single ribs.

==In culture==
In the Netflix Original series &quot;Lady Dynamite&quot; (2017, Season 2 episode &quot;Souplutions&quot;), Maria Bamfordâs mother makes for the King and Queen of Norway when they visit Duluth, Minnesota.

<text>A public service or service of general (economic) interest is any service intended to address specific needs pertaining to the aggregate members of a community, whether provided directly by a public sector agency, via public financing available to private businesses or voluntary organisations, or provided by private businesses subject to a high level of government regulation. Some public services are provided on behalf of a government&#x27;s residents or in the interest of its citizens. The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through democratic elections) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of income, physical ability or mental acuity. Examples of such services include the fire services, police, air force, paramedics and public service broadcasting.

Even where public services are neither publicly provided nor publicly financed, they are usually subject to regulation going beyond that applying to most economic sectors for social and political reasons. Public policy, when made in the public&#x27;s interest and with its motivations, is a type of public service.

==Sectors==


In modern developed countries, the term &quot;public services&quot; (or &quot;services of general interest&quot;) often includes:
* Courts
* Education
* Electricity
* Emergency services
* Environmental protection
* Health care
* Mail
* Military
*Policing
* Public buildings
* Public broadcasting
* Public libraries
* Public parks
* Public policy-making
* Public utilities
* Public transportation
* Social services
* State school
* Telecommunications
* Transportation infrastructure
* Urban planning
* Waste management
* Water supply network

In developing countries, public services tend to be much less well developed. For example, water services might only be available to the wealthy middle class. For political reasons, the service is often subsidized, which reduces the finance potentially available for expansion to poorer communities. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 is, however, a global initiative which aims to influence the provision of public services and infrastructure for marginalized demographics.

==History==
Governing bodies have long provided core public services. The tradition of keeping citizens secure through organized military defense dates to at least four thousand years ago.

Maintaining order through local delegated authority originated at least as early as the Warring States period (5th to 3rd centuries BCE) in ancient China with the institution of (prefectures) under the control of a centrally appointed prefect. Historical evidence of state provision of dispute resolution through a legal/justice system goes back at least as far as ancient Egypt.

A primary public service in ancient history involved ensuring the general favor of the gods through a theologically and ceremonially correct state religion.

The widespread provision of public utilities as public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the municipal development of gas and water services. Later, governments began to provide other services such as electricity and health care. In most developed countries, local or national governments continue to provide such services, the biggest exceptions being the U.S. and the UK, where private provision is arguably proportionally more significant. Nonetheless, such privately provided public services are often strongly regulated, for example (in the US) by Public Utility Commissions.

Examples noted in a history of public services in Oxford include street-repair, cleansing, and lighting, drainage and sewage disposal, water, gas and electricity supply, police and fire services, the Post Office, transport, hospital services, and the provision of baths, parks and cemeteries.

==Characteristics==
A public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a public good (being non rivalrous and non excludable), but most are services which may (according to prevailing social norms) be under-provided by the market. In most cases public services are services, i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of goods. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors that are natural monopolies.

They may involve outputs that are hard to attribute to specific individual effort or hard to measure in terms of key characteristics such as quality. They often require high levels of training and education. They may attract people with a public service ethos who wish to give something to the wider public or community through their work.

The process of assessing the needs of the people of an area, and then designing and securing an appropriate public service to meet those needs, is often referred to in the UK as &quot;commissioning&quot;. The commissioned services may be delivered by organisations in the public sector, private sector or third sector: when the private or third sector is involved the process of commissioning will usually be linked with a process of procurement, to determine who will provide the services, at what cost and on what terms. Commissioning is often seen as a cyclical process.

==Implications ==

Public services can be constructed, coordinated and operated in many ways or forms. They include government agencies, independent state-funded institutes, government-coordinated organizations, civil society, military agencies and volunteers.

===Government employees===
Government agencies are not profit-oriented and their employees are often motivated differently. Studies of their work have found contrasting results including both higher levels of effort and fewer hours of work. A survey in the UK found that private sector hiring managers do not credit government experience as much as private sector experience. Public workers tend to make less in wages when adjusting for education, although that difference is reduced when benefits and hours are included. Public servants have other intangible benefits such as increased job security and high wages.

===Need satisfaction and sustainability===
A study concluded that public services are associated with higher human need satisfaction and lower energy requirements while contemporary forms of economic growth are linked with the opposite. Authors find that the contemporary economic system is structurally misaligned with goals of sustainable development and that to date no nation can provide decent living standards at sustainable levels of energy and resource use. They provide analysis about factors in social provisioning and assess that improving beneficial provisioning-factors and infrastructure would allow for sustainable forms of sufficient need satisfaction.

===Choice===
&quot;Open Public Services&quot;, a white paper published by the CameronâClegg coalition in the United Kingdom in July 2011, aimed to create a comprehensive policy framework for &quot;good public services&quot;. It set out the coalition&#x27;s programme for reform of public services, described as a programme of &quot;wide ambitions&quot; expected to be implemented over a period of time, not all at once. Five principles were to underlie open public services:
*Choice, wherever possible
*Decentralisation to the lowest appropriate level
*Diversity
*Fairness
*Accountablity.

The journalist David Boyle conducted an independent review for the UK&#x27;s Treasury and the Cabinet Office on public demand for choice in public services which reported in 2013. The principle of choice where possible was embodied in the Choice Charter, published on 16 May 2013, where four choice principles were outlined:
*allowing people a say in how public services are provided for them
*allowing people the opportunity to exercise choice where it is available
*making clear, accessible and high-quality information available to support choice
*facilitating complaints over the degree of choice offered as well as over the quality of services.
Between December 2012 and May 2013, &quot;Choice Frameworks&quot; were scheduled for publication covering NHS care, social housing, school education, early years education and adult social care.

===Nationalization===

Nationalization took off following the World wars of the first half of the twentieth century. In parts of Europe, central planning was implemented in the belief that it would make production more efficient. Many public services, especially electricity, fossil fuels and public transport are products of this era. Following the Second World War, many countries also began to implement universal health care and expanded education under the funding and guidance of the state.

===Privatization===
There are several ways to privatize public services. A free-market corporation may be established and sold to private investors, relinquishing government control altogether. Thus it becomes a private (not public) service. Another option, used in the Nordic countries, is to establish a corporation, but keep ownership or voting power essentially in the hands of the government. For example, the Finnish state owned 49% of Kemira until 2007, the rest being owned by private investors. A 49% share did not make it a &quot;government enterprise&quot;, but it meant that all other investors together would have to oppose the state&#x27;s opinion in order to overturn the state&#x27;s decisions in the shareholder&#x27;s meeting. 

A regulated corporation can also acquire permits on the agreement that they fulfill certain public service duties. When a private corporation runs a natural monopoly, then the corporation is typically heavily regulated, to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Lastly, the government can buy the service on the free market. In many countries, medication is provided in this manner: the government reimburses part of the price of the medication. Also, bus traffic, electricity, healthcare and waste management are privatized in this way. One recent innovation, used in the UK increasingly as well as Australia and Canada, is using public-private partnerships, which involve giving a long lease to private consortia in return for partly or fully funding infrastructure costs.

<doc id="1291791" wikidata="Q332512" url="?curid=1291791" title="Superheater">
<text>A superheater is a device used to convert saturated steam or wet steam into superheated steam or dry steam. Superheated steam is used in steam turbines for electricity generation, in some steam engines, and in processes such as steam reforming. There are three types of superheaters: radiant, convection, and separately fired. A superheater can vary in size from a few tens of feet to several hundred feet (a few metres to some hundred metres).

== Types ==
* A radiant superheater is placed directly in the radiant zone of the combustion chamber near the water wall so as to absorb heat by radiation.
* A convection superheater is located in the convective zone of the furnace, in the path of the hot flue gases, usually ahead of an economizer. A convection superheater is also called a primary superheater.
* A separately fired superheater is a superheater that is placed outside the main boiler and has its own separate combustion system. This superheater design incorporates additional burners in the area of superheater pipes. It is rarely, if ever, used because of its poor efficiency and the fact that the quality of the steam produced is no better than that from other superheater types.

== Steam turbines ==
In many applications, a turbine will make more efficient use of steam energy than a reciprocating engine. However, saturated (&quot;wet&quot;) steam at boiling point may contain, or condense into, liquid water droplets, which can cause damage to turbine blades. Therefore, steam turbine engines typically superheat the steam, usually within the primary boiler, to ensure that no liquid water enters the system and damages the blades.

== Steam engines ==
In a steam engine, the superheater further heats the steam generated by the boiler, increasing its thermal energy and decreasing the likelihood that it will condense inside the engine. Superheaters increase the thermal efficiency of the steam engine, and have been widely adopted. Steam which has been superheated is known as superheated steam, and non-superheated steam is called saturated steam or wet steam. From the early 20th century, superheaters were applied to many steam locomotives, to most steam vehicles, and to stationary steam engines. It is still used in conjunction with steam turbines in electrical power generating stations throughout the world.

=== Locomotives ===

In steam locomotive use, by far the most common form of superheater is the fire-tube type. That takes the saturated steam supplied in the dry pipe into a &quot;superheater header&quot; mounted against the tube sheet in the smokebox. The steam is then passed through a number of superheater elements, which are long pipes placed inside the larger diameter fire tubes, called flues. Hot combustion gases from the locomotive&#x27;s fire pass through the flues and, as well as heating the water in the surrounding boiler, they heat the steam inside the superheater elements they flow over. The superheater element doubles back on itself so that the heated steam can return. Most do that twice at the fire end and once at the smokebox end, so that the steam travels a distance of four times the header&#x27;s length while being heated. At the end of its journey through the elements, the superheated steam passes into a separate compartment of the superheater header and then to the cylinders of the engine.

==== Damper and snifting valve ====
The steam passing through the superheater elements cools their metal and prevents them from melting, but when the throttle closes that cooling effect is absent, and so a damper closes in the smokebox to cut off the flow through the flues and prevent them being damaged. Some locomotives, particularly on the London and North Eastern Railway, were fitted with snifting valves, which admitted air to the superheater when the locomotive was coasting. That kept the superheater elements relatively cooler and the cylinders warm. The snifting valve can be seen behind the chimney on many LNER locomotives.

==== Front-end throttle ====
A superheater increases the distance between the throttle and the cylinders in the steam circuit and thus reduces the immediacy of throttle action. To counteract that, some later steam locomotives were fitted with a front-end throttle, placed in the smokebox after the superheater. Such locomotives can sometimes be identified by an external throttle rod that stretches the whole length of the boiler, with a crank on the outside of the smokebox. That arrangement also allows superheated steam to be used for auxiliary appliances, such as the dynamo and air pumps. Another benefit of the front-end throttle is that superheated steam is immediately available. With a dome throttle, it takes some time before the super heater actually provides an efficiency benefit.

==== Cylinder valves ====
Locomotives with superheaters are usually fitted with piston valves or poppet valves, because it is difficult to keep a slide valve properly lubricated at high temperature.

==== Applications ====
The first practical superheater was developed in Germany by Wilhelm Schmidt during the 1880s and 1890s. The Prussian S 4 locomotive, with an early form of superheater, was built in 1898, and more were produced in series from 1902. The benefits of the invention were demonstrated in the UK by the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1906. The GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer, G. J. Churchward, believed that the Schmidt type could be bettered, and the design and testing of an indigenous Swindon type was undertaken, culminating in the Swindon No. 3 superheater in 1909. Douglas Earle Marsh carried out a series of comparative tests between members of his I3 class using saturated steam and those fitted with the Schmidt superheater between October 1907 and March 1910, proving the advantages of the latter in terms of performance and efficiency.

Improved superheaters were introduced by John G. Robinson of the Great Central Railway at Gorton locomotive works, by Robert Urie of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) at Eastleigh railway works, and Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway (Great Britain), also at Eastleigh.

The oldest surviving steam locomotives with a superheater, as well as being the first narrow gauge locomotive with a superheater, is the Bh.1 owned by SteiermÃ¤rkische Landesbahnen (STLB) in Austria, which runs excursions trains on the Mur Valley Railroad.

===== Urie&#x27;s &quot;Eastleigh&quot; superheater =====
Robert Urie&#x27;s design of superheater for the LSWR was the product of experience with his H15 class 4-6-0 locomotives. In anticipation of performance trials, eight examples were fitted with Schmidt and Robinson superheaters, and two others remained saturated. However, World War I intervened before the trials could take place, although an LSWR Locomotive Committee report from late 1915 noted that the Robinson version returned the best fuel efficiency. It consumed an average of coal per mile over an average distance of , compared to and coal for the Schmidt and saturated examples respectively.

However, the report stated that both superheater types had serious drawbacks. The Schmidt system featured a damper control on the superheater header that caused hot gases to condense into sulfuric acid, which caused pitting and subsequent weakening of the superheater elements. Leakage of gases was also commonplace between the elements and the header, and maintenance was difficult without removal of the horizontally-arranged assembly. The Robinson version suffered from temperature variations caused by saturated and superheated steam chambers being adjacent, causing material stress, and had similar access problems as the Schmidt type.

The report&#x27;s recommendations enabled Urie to design a new type of superheater with separate saturated steam headers above and below the superheater header. They were connected by elements beginning at the saturated header, running through the flue tubes and back to the superheater header, and the whole assembly was vertically arranged for ease of maintenance. The device was highly successful in service, but was heavy and expensive to construct.

==== Advantages and disadvantages ====
The main advantages of using a superheater are reduced fuel and water consumption but there is a price to pay in increased maintenance costs. In most cases the benefits outweighed the costs and superheaters became widely used, although British shunting locomotives (switchers) were rarely fitted with superheaters. In locomotives used for mineral traffic the advantages seem to have been marginal. For example, the North Eastern Railway fitted superheaters to some of its NER Class P mineral locomotives but later began to remove them.

Without careful maintenance, superheaters are prone to a particular type of hazardous failure, involving the superheater tubes bursting at their U-shaped turns. They are difficult to manufacture, and to test when installed, and a rupture causes the superheated high-pressure steam to escape into the large flues, back to the fire and into the locomotive cab, creating extreme danger for the locomotive crew.

<doc id="1291798" wikidata="Q473003" url="?curid=1291798" title="Municipalization">
<text>Municipalization is the transfer of private entities, assets, service providers, or corporations to public ownership by a municipality, including (but not limited to) a city, county, or public utility district ownership. The transfer may be from private ownership (usually by purchase) or from other levels of government. It is the opposite of privatization and is different from nationalization. The term municipalization largely refers to the transfer of ownership of utilities from Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs) to public ownership, and operation, by local government whether that be at the city, county or state level. While this is most often applied to electricity it can also refer to solar energy, water, sewer, trash, natural gas or other services.

Between 2006 and 2016, there have been 13 different communities in the United States that have successfully switched from an IOU to a municipal utility. Most of these communities consisted of 10,000 people or less. Although proponents of municipalization have attempted to municipalize via ballot initiatives, many have failed.

==Motivations==

The key motivation for municipalization stems from a difference in priorities and goals of the community members and the incumbent utility. While incumbent IOUs have the objective of reliable and safe electricity that can provide a competitive profit for the investors, municipalized utilities are free from the need to provide for private profits and can focus on the pursuit of other policy goals, especially sustainability measures and experimentation with alternative energy policy. Efforts to municipalize often begin with the sentiment that the IOU is not managed primarily for the benefit of the citizens and that by undertaking municipalization of electricity services, a city government can exercise greater control over electricity generation and distribution (also often tying this process to sustainability measures). There is also a neoliberal argument stemming from the historical formation of utility conglomerates. The transition from direct current (DC) systems to alternating current (AC) systems in the early twentieth century allowed for greater access to electricity for Americans and enabled the electricity industry to shift to a larger scale. The economies of scale associated with providing a utility created natural monopolies and the associated consolidation of different types of electrical service in urban areas: street lighting, building lighting, industrial machinery, and streetcars. The recent efforts to municipalize electricity represent a return to municipalization as a mechanism to curb monopoly power and corruption. It is also important to acknowledge that the monopoly power of many incumbent utility providers means that they have strong financial and political resources to resist municipalization. Additionally there is always a legal factor with municipalization and state laws governing municipalization vary widely across the country sometimes making the process impossible.

==Services==
There have been two main waves of municipalization in developed countries. The first took place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, when municipalities in many developed countries acquired local private providers of a range of public services. The driving reason in most cases was the failure of private providers to sufficiently expand service provision outside wealthy parts of urban areas.

The second wave took place in the early 1990s, when after the end of the communist states in eastern Europe state-owned companies in many public service sectors were broken up and transferred to municipal control. This was typical in sectors such as water, waste management, and public transport, although not in electricity and natural gas.

Such regional companies either remained under municipal control, or were privatized. Privatization was done variously: by selling them to investors, by giving a concession or a management contract. Examples include the water sector in the Czech Republic, over half of which has been privatized.

==Governments==
In the United States, municipalization often refers to incorporation of an entire county into its municipalities, leaving no unincorporated areas. This generally ends &quot;de facto&quot; the county&#x27;s own home rule, which in most states allows it to act as the municipal service provider in those unincorporated areas. The county is left offering only those services d of it by the state constitution, which are generally only extensions of state government like courts and sheriff departments. As with utilities, the county&#x27;s assets usually end up being distributed among the cities, though this is less likely if the process is gradual rather than all at once.

One example of municipalization is the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, or SMUD, of Sacramento, California. In another, larger example, Fulton County, Georgia, which includes the city of Atlanta, is currently undergoing full municipalization.

==Examples==

While municipalization is quite rare in the United States over the past few decades (&quot;of these 900 municipal-owned utility firms, only 2 percent have completed municipalization since 1990&quot;) there are a few key, and recent, examples that are often cited.

===Long Island, New York===
Basic Information: &quot;The Long Island Power Authority territory consists of New York&#x27;s Nassau and Suffolk counties and part of Queens, New York City, including the JFK International Airport.&quot;

Key motivating factors: The effort to municipalize Long Island&#x27;s electricity was primarily motivated by rising (and high) prices and bad reliability.

Timeline of Significant Events:

1980s: The investor-owned Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) faces near bankruptcy catalyzing the effort to municipalize led by then Governor Mario Cuomo. Despite public support for municipalization the effort faced strong opposition from LILCO.

1985: The Long Island Power Authority Act passes which established Long Island Power Authority (LIPA). LIPA was charged with taking over the Shoreham plant and its debts, as well as controlling electricity costs.

1998: Governor George Pataki led the effort to take over LILCO&#x27;s entire system due to customers still facing high utility prices. The takeover was financed through public bond offerings and over the next few years customers experienced reduced rate.

2012: Hurricane Sandy hits Long Island significantly damaging the power system and causing extensive outages. LIPA faces intense criticism for its response.

2013: In an effort led by Governor Andrew Cuomo, the LIPA Reform Act of 2013 which reorganized LIPA, placing the day-toâday operations under PSEG was approved by the state legislature.

Results: The effort has been largely successful given that customer approval has improved to over 90 percent satisfaction level and LIPA&#x27;s rates are no longer the highest in the New York Metro Area. This reflects that the key motivating factors were addressed.

===Boulder, Colorado===
Key Motivating Factors: The effort in Boulder were motivated by having greater autonomy and customer choice so that the city could more directly meet its Clean Energy goals. This effort was primarily motivated by sustainability concerns.

Timeline of Significant Events:

2002: The Boulder City Council passed Resolution 906, committing the community to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to the target established by the Kyoto Protocol.

2005: In response to having difficulty meeting the goals of Resolution 906 and wanting more energy decision-making control the city created a task force to explore municipalization as an option for faster innovation capacity.

2005: &quot;The feasibility study found that munipalization would increase renewable energy, reduce greenhouse gases, maintain reliability, and reduce rates for customers. The study also found that this would make the utilities more aligned with the needs of the community and would allow any excess energy revenue to be reinvested in Boulder.&quot; The study was, however, all predictive and acknowledged many uncertainties.

2017: &quot;The City of Boulder, along with 14 other parties, signed a stipulation filed with the Public Utilities Commission, which gave the commission the opportunity to evaluate a Colorado Energy Plan Portfolio during the pending Electric Resource Plan proceeding.&quot;

Results: The municipalization effort&#x27;s most significant expenses have been from delays and regulatory roadblocks. In the last four years, Boulder has been involved in legal proceedings with Xcel at the local and state levels, and courts have ruled both in favor of and against municipalization. As of 2/26/18 Boulder has &quot;two agreements done&quot; â the interim cost agreement and the easement agreement â and are &quot;working on a final agreement on costs&quot; in the process of the city&#x27;s negotiations with Xcel Energy.

===San Francisco===
Key Motivating Factors: The California energy crisis spiked public support for publicly owned and controlled municipal utilities.

Timeline of Significant Events:

1990s: Angered by power outages and rate hikes San Franciscans engaged in various attempts to municipalize their electricity.

2001: Two ballot propositions which would have enabled the city to municipalize its electricity faced strong opposition from the incumbent utilities. Both ballot propositions were defeated, one by a narrow margin of 500 votes.

2002: Advocates tried ballot measures once more but were outspent by the incumbent utilities, which spent over $2 million.

Results: This is a key example of a place where several attempts to municipalize have failed giving evidence to the importance of the transaction costs associated with municipalization.

==Cost-benefit analysis==

===Political/transaction costs===
The costs of municipalization tend to both front loaded and high. The largest costs come from the process of passing a ballot measure and acquiring the utility company. Although these many seem simple at face value these steps are often extremely costly and difficult because of the financial and political power that incumbent utilities possess. Still it is much more cost effective to purchase existing infrastructure in fact all processes of municipalization since the 1980s have purchased the incumbent utility assets. And the cost to the acquisitions has not been cheap, &quot;most public power takeovers are in the vicinity of 140% of book value.&quot; Once the utilities have been acquired, local governments face the steep costs of financing the transition and developing the expertise to run a comprehensive system of electricity distribution as well as, in some cases, generation and transmission. The transaction costs are high, because cities must borrow to pay the IOUs for the power lines, they must develop the expertise and ability to manage a LTS, and they often face years of battles in courts and in elections due to challenges from the IOU. A study done by the Bay Area Economic Forum found that the key cost components that determine whether a new MU&#x27;s rates will be higher or lower than the incumbent IOU&#x27;s rates are: 1) &quot;the combination of the income tax exemption and debt-only capital structure, both of which lower MU rates relative to IOU rates;&quot; 2) &quot;the premium over book paid for the distribution assets, which will increase MU rates relative to IOU rates;&quot; and 3) &quot;the MU&#x27;s cost of generating or purchasing power, which is a wild card that could increase or decrease relative MU/IOU rates.&quot;

===Potential benefits===
There are, however, benefits to this process as discussed in the motivation section above. Municipal bonds &quot;typically have lower interest rates than investorâowned utility bonds, resulting in lower costs.&quot; Municipal utilities also do not pay dividends to investors which can help reduce costs. Additionally, &quot;municipal utilities are exempt from federal taxes.&quot; There is also potential for Economic development benefits to occur when municipalized utilities &quot;promote economic development in their community by offering special rates or discounted connection fees for large customers or new businesses.&quot; There are also flexibility options in complementary policies such as offer&quot; rebates, feed-in tariffs, and other programs to support increased&quot; distributed solar energy programs. Since &quot;Electricity rates not only recover costs, but also provide customers with price signals that influence how customers use electricity and whether to make investments in distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, or other technologies,&quot; there are potential sustainability benefits to having increased control over electricity pricing. One example of such pricing is the introduction of time varying rates which are designed to reduce peak demand they are a type of demand response policy. Timeâvarying rates can have considerable impact by &quot;encouraging many customers to make small adjustments to the timing of their energy consumption, resulting in a flatter load curve for the entire system.&quot;

===Potential downfalls===
According to a report on municipalization prepared for the District of Columbia:On the other hand, municipal utilities face challenges that can result in higher costs. The acquisition cost for the municipalized infrastructure was in some cases significantly higher than what was being recovered by the IOU, putting immediate and longâlasting upward pressure on rates. Operationally, IOUs often have economies of scale that can lead to lower legal, management, and purchasing costs per unit of energy. Municipal utilities are not typically monitored closely by a public service commission, and inadequate auditing can allow poor utility practices to continue unchecked. Finally, the incumbent IOUs had a single, focused objective: safe, reliable power at least cost. Municipal utilities, on the other hand, also focused on the pursuit of other policy goals, which can result in higher electricity costs.

==Alternatives to municipalization==

Collective Private Ownership: This refers to communities coming together to take collective ownership of a utility. One example is the community shares program used in Ellensburg, Washington. In this case electricity customers may buy shares in a solar field which was initially financed through the public utility and in turn receive a proportional rebate applied through their electricity billing. Customers also have the option of selling or giving away their shares to non profits or other customers.

Privatization: A process by which the for-profit private sector supplants the public sector&#x27;s provision of goods and/or services. There are a number of methods of privatization including the transfer of ownership from public to private entities, the displacement of public spending by private financing, or private entities assuming management and operational responsibilities of public services.

Nationalization: Nationalization is a similar process to municipalization but shifts ownership and operational control towards the government at a national or federal level. There is often an assumed tradeoff between the promised equality under nationalization and the promised efficiency of privatization.

<doc id="1291799" wikidata="Q158257" url="?curid=1291799" title="HluÄÃ­n">
<text>HluÄÃ­n (; ; ) is a town in Opava District the Moravian-Silesian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 13,000 inhabitants. It was the centre of the historic HluÄÃ­n Region. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
HluÄÃ­n consists of three municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*HluÄÃ­n (11,028)
*BobrovnÃ­ky (1,295)
*DarkoviÄky (1,311)

==Geography==

HluÄÃ­n is located about north of Ostrava and east of Opava. The northern part of the municipal territory lies in the Opava Hilly Land within the Silesian Lowlands. The southern part extends into the eastern tip of the NÃ­zkÃ½ JesenÃ­k range.

HluÄÃ­nskÃ© Lake is an artificial lake on the outskirts of the town. The Opava River forms the southeastern municipal border.

==History==

The first written mention of HluÄÃ­n is from 1303, when it was part of the Duchy of Opava. The town was probably founded by King Ottokar II in 1256 to ensure peace on the border between Margraviate of Moravia and Duchy of Opole.

Until 1521, HluÄÃ­n belonged to the Landek estate within the Duchy of Opava. In 1521, it was acquired by the Piast Dukes of Opole. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the town burned down several times. In 1694 it was liberated of its serfdom. In 1742, after the First Silesian War, the town was given to the Kingdom of Prussia by the Treaty of Berlin. In 1845, the HluÄÃ­n estate was bought by the Rothschild family. Four annual fairs were held in the town in the late 19th century.

The town was administered by the Prussian Province of Silesia until 1920, when it became part of Czechoslovakia after World War I. The transferral of the HluÄÃ­n Region sparked controversy between Germans, Czechs and Poles. By a biased interpretation of the law, the new Czechoslovak authorities banned schooling in German even though that was the language spoken by the majority in the town.

After the Munich Agreement in 1938, HluÄÃ­n was annexed by Nazi Germany and was again made part of the Province of Silesia, and its Germanized name &quot;Hultschin&quot; was restored. During World War II, the Germans sent prisoners from the military prison in KÅodzko to forced labour in the town. HluÄÃ­n was restored to Czechoslovakia in 1945. People identified as German-speaking at the census in 1930 were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, some Germans left voluntarily. People who were labeled Czechs, even though they were actually Czech-speaking Germans, were spared expulsion.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The I/56 road from Ostrava to Opava passes through the town.

HluÄÃ­n is the terminus of a railway line of regional importance heading from Opava.

==Sights==

The historic town centre is formed by the MÃ­rovÃ© Square and its surroundings. The centre was delimited by town fortifications, built in 1534â1535. Most of the town walls were demolished by 1829. Several fragments and seven bastions have been preserved to this day.

HluÄÃ­n Castle was built in the late Gothic style in 1526. It is a two-storey building with an irregular floor plan, and includes a small castle park. Today it houses the HluÄÃ­n Region Museum.

The second landmark is the parish Church of Saint John the Baptist. It was first mentioned in 1378 and was rebuilt several times in Renaissance, Baroque and pseudo-Gothic styles. The bell tower, high, was built in 1791.

In DarkoviÄky is the HluÄÃ­n-DarkoviÄky Czechoslovak Fortification Complex. It is an exhibition of a unique military technology from the 1930s.

==Notable people==
*Pavel Josef VejvanovskÃ½ (â1693), composer
*Emanuel SchÃ¤fer (1900â1974), German SS functionary and war criminal
*Verner LiÄka (born 1954), football player and manager
*JiÅÃ­ Pavlenka (born 1992), footballer
*Michaela KoneÄnÃ¡ (born 1998), handball player

==Twin towns â sister cities==

HluÄÃ­n is twinned with:
* NamysÅÃ³w, Poland
* NebelschÃ¼tz, Germany
* RuÅ¾omberok, Slovakia

<text>Frederic Walter Harris (6 March 1915 â 4 January 1979) was a British politician and businessman. He was Conservative Member of Parliament in Croydon between 1948 and 1970.

Fred Harris was born in Balham, South London, and educated at Belmont College, Streatham. After working for a period in local government, he founded his own business with money invested by Sir Sydney Marshall. Marshall&#x27;s Malted Milk was set up in Clapham but soon moved to Croydon. The company expanded and during World War II making a range of foodstuffs. Harris made his fortune. The company became Marshall&#x27;s Universal Ltd, then was publicly listed. By 1965, the company had fourteen subsidiaries in Britain and East Africa, working in engineering, vehicles, canning, food manufacture and farming. It had an annual turnover of Â£5 million; Harris remained Chairman of every company, even as MP.

Harris was active in the local Conservative Party. He stood in the 1945 and 1946 local elections in Broad Green and Addiscombe respectively but was unsuccessful. He was elected to the council of the County Borough of Croydon for Central ward in December 1946 in a by-election, however, and was re-elected in 1947 for a full four-year term. He served as a ratepayers&#x27; association representative, which was effectively a cover for the local Conservatives. He was also elected as the youngest councillor on Surrey County Council, representing Godstone.

Croydon had been safe Conservative territory since first electing its own Member of Parliament in 1885. But in the 1945 General Election, the Labour had taken Croydon South and come within 607 votes in Croydon North. In January 1948, Sir Henry Willink resigned as Conservative MP for Croydon North. Labour and the Liberals selected high-profile candidates, Harold Nicolson, while Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett stood for the Liberal Party. Harris was selected by the local Conservative Association as their candidate for the Croydon North by-election, and had their wholehearted support.

Conservative Central Office were not so sure. They were concerned that a local businessman with little fame or track record would struggle to defeat a former MP and World War II hero. Odds were given of 6:1 against the Conservatives winning. Harris was summoned to see Party leader Winston Churchill, which Harris realised was to dissuade him from standing. He later said, &quot;when he discovered how determined I was to win the seat, he put his arm around my shoulders and said he would help me all he could&quot;. Churchill toured the constituency, making speeches from the top of his car. His daughter Mary Soames was then in a Croydon maternity hospital about to give birth (to her son Nicholas), bringing the campaign positive publicity. Harris gained a majority of 11,664. Following the result, a national newspaper ran the headline &quot;Oh what a beautiful morning&quot;. The song (from &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;) became his theme tune when touring Croydon.

Harris never shone in Parliament. He was a moderate Tory and embraced change and democracy. He had no time for the right-wing, predicting that their politics would &quot;die&quot;. In Croydon, however, he was extremely popular, working hard especially on casework for individual constituents, which he said was the most rewarding part of the job. He was given the honour to drive the last tram (before Tramlink returned) through the constituency with the Mayor of Croydon. He increased his majority and served as MP for Croydon North, then Croydon North West for 22 years until he stepped down at the 1970 general election. This at that time made him the longest-serving Croydon MP (a record later broken by Bernard Weatherill).

Fred Harris had three children with his first wife â Roger who became an engineer in Kenya, Gillian, who also moved to East Africa, and Jacqueline who worked as secretary to the Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party. His wife died in 1955. In 1957 he married Joan Bagnall. He lived in Woldingham, Surrey and on his farm in Subukia, Kenya.

Harris was very keen on sport. He had held a schoolboy cricket record and played football (soccer) in the Spartan League. He played tennis all his life and was an occasional croc hunter. He campaigned successfully for Croydon Council to build Croydon Sports Arena in South Norwood. He was also a racehorse owner, with Gordon Richards as a regular jockey. In the 1940s he had a considerable lucky streak, with 50 wins out of 90 outings. His horse &#x27;Now or Never&#x27; won the Great Metropolitan at Epsom in 1948.

Harris died in January 1979, aged 63, in Kenya, after a long illness.

<doc id="1291806" wikidata="Q1320217" url="?curid=1291806" title="Central government">
<text>A central government is the government that is a controlling power over a unitary state. Another distinct but sovereign political entity is a federal government, which may have distinct powers at various levels of government, authorized or delegated to it by the federation and mutually agreed upon by each of the federated states. 

The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments on a sub-national level, such as regional, state, provincial, local and other instances. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and government through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a constitution or other law.

Common responsibilities of this level of government which are not granted to lower levels are maintaining national security and exercising international diplomacy, including the right to sign binding treaties. Essentially, the central government has the power to make laws for the whole country, in contrast with local governments.

The difference between a central government and a federal government is that the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government and are often created through a process of devolution. As such they may be unilaterally revoked with a simple change in the law. An example of this was done in 1973 when the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 abolished the government of Northern Ireland which had been created under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It is common for a federal government to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states and therefore its powers to affect the status of the balance of powers is significantly smaller (as in the United States). Thus federal governments are often established voluntarily from &#x27;below&#x27; whereas devolution grants self-government from above.

== Examples == 
=== Unitary states ===
There are, and have been, many countries which have delegated powers, some include:
* Bangladesh
* People&#x27;s Republic of China â see autonomous administrative divisions of China
* Denmark â see the autonomous regions of the Faroe Islands and Greenland
* France âÂ see the autonomous region of New-Caledonia
* Finland â devolved powers to governments of Ãland.
* Republic of China
* Georgia â see autonomous republics
* Japan
* Norway
* New Zealand
* Republic of Korea
* Italy â see autonomous province of Italy
* Indonesia
* Spain â see autonomous communities
* Philippines - see Provinces of the Philippines and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao
* Portugal â see autonomous regions of Portugal
* Turkey
* Ukraine
* United Kingdom â devolved powers to governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
* Vietnam

=== Federations ===
A federal government is the common or national government of a federation. The United States is considered the first modern federation. After declaring independence from Britain, the U.S. adopted its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation in 1781. This was the first step towards federalism by establishing the confederal Congress. However, Congress was limited as to its ability to pursue economic, military, and judiciary reform. In 1787, a Constitutional Convention drafted the United States Constitution during the Philadelphia Convention. After the ratification of the Constitution by nine states in 1788, the U.S. was officially a federation, putting the U.S. in a unique position where the central government exists by the sufferance of the individual states rather than the reverse. 

Other states followed suit in establishing federal governments: Switzerland (1848); Canada (1867); Germany (1871 and again 1949); Brazil (1891); Australia (1901); Russia (1917); Austria (1920 and again 1945) and India (1947 and again 1950). Examples include:

* Austria
* Argentina
* Australia â states and territories of Australia
* Belgium â see communities, regions and language areas of Belgium
* Brazil
* India - States and union territories of India
* Canada â see provinces and territories of Canada
* Germany â see states of Germany
* Malaysia
* Mexico â see states of Mexico
* Nigeria
* Nepal
* Pakistan â see administrative units of Pakistan
* Russia â see federal districts of Russia, federal subjects of Russia
* Soviet Union â see republics of the Soviet Union
* Sudan
* Switzerland â cantons of Switzerland
* United States â see U.S. states
* Venezuela â see states of Venezuela

=== Confederations ===
* United States Government under the Articles of Confederation
* Confederate States of America

<text>The competitive LotkaâVolterra equations are a simple model of the population dynamics of species competing for some common resource. They can be further generalised to the generalized LotkaâVolterra equation to include trophic interactions.

==Overview==
The form is similar to the LotkaâVolterra equations for predation in that the equation for each species has one term for self-interaction and one term for the interaction with other species. In the equations for predation, the base population model is exponential. For the competition equations, the logistic equation is the basis.

The logistic population model, when used by ecologists often takes the following form:
formula_1

Here is the size of the population at a given time, is inherent per-capita growth rate, and is the carrying capacity.

===Two species===
Given two populations, and , with logistic dynamics, the LotkaâVolterra formulation adds an additional term to account for the species&#x27; interactions. Thus the competitive LotkaâVolterra equations are:
formula_2

Here, represents the effect species 2 has on the population of species 1 and represents the effect species 1 has on the population of species 2. These values do not have to be equal. Because this is the competitive version of the model, all interactions must be harmful (competition) and therefore all &quot;Î±&quot;-values are positive. Also, note that each species can have its own growth rate and carrying capacity. A complete classification of this dynamics, even for all sign patterns of above coefficients, is available, which is based upon equivalence to the 3-type replicator equation.

===&quot;N&quot; species===
This model can be generalized to any number of species competing against each other. One can think of the populations and growth rates as vectors, &#x27;s as a matrix. Then the equation for any species becomes
formula_3
or, if the carrying capacity is pulled into the interaction matrix (this doesn&#x27;t actually change the equations, only how the interaction matrix is defined),
formula_4
where is the total number of interacting species. For simplicity all self-interacting terms are often set to 1.

===Possible dynamics===
The definition of a competitive LotkaâVolterra system assumes that all values in the interaction matrix are positive or 0 ( for all , ). If it is also assumed that the population of any species will increase in the absence of competition unless the population is already at the carrying capacity ( for all ), then some definite statements can be made about the behavior of the system.

# The populations of all species will be bounded between 0 and 1 at all times (, for all ) as long as the populations started out positive.
# Smale showed that LotkaâVolterra systems that meet the above conditions and have five or more species (&quot;N&quot; â¥ 5) can exhibit any asymptotic behavior, including a fixed point, a limit cycle, an &quot;n&quot;-torus, or attractors.
# Hirsch proved that all of the dynamics of the attractor occur on a manifold of dimension &quot;N&quot;â1. This essentially says that the attractor cannot have dimension greater than &quot;N&quot;â1. This is important because a limit cycle cannot exist in fewer than two dimensions, an &quot;n&quot;-torus cannot exist in less than &quot;n&quot; dimensions, and chaos cannot occur in less than three dimensions. So, Hirsch proved that competitive LotkaâVolterra systems cannot exhibit a limit cycle for &quot;N&quot; &lt; 3, or any torus or chaos for &quot;N&quot; &lt; 4. This is still in agreement with Smale that any dynamics can occur for &quot;N&quot; â¥ 5.
#*More specifically, Hirsch showed there is an invariant set &quot;C&quot; that is homeomorphic to the (&quot;N&quot;â1)-dimensional simplex formula_5 and is a global attractor of every point excluding the origin. This carrying simplex contains all of the asymptotic dynamics of the system.
# To create a stable ecosystem the Î±ij matrix must have all positive eigenvalues. For large-&quot;N&quot; systems LotkaâVolterra models are either unstable or have low connectivity. Kondoh and Ackland and Gallagher have independently shown that large, stable LotkaâVolterra systems arise if the elements of (i.e. the features of the species) can evolve in accordance with natural selection.

==4-dimensional example==
A simple 4-dimensional example of a competitive LotkaâVolterra system has been characterized by Vano &quot;et al.&quot; Here the growth rates and interaction matrix have been set to

formula_6

with formula_7 for all formula_8. This system is chaotic and has a largest Lyapunov exponent of 0.0203. From the theorems by Hirsch, it is one of the lowest-dimensional chaotic competitive LotkaâVolterra systems. The KaplanâYorke dimension, a measure of the dimensionality of the attractor, is 2.074. This value is not a whole number, indicative of the fractal structure inherent in a strange attractor. The coexisting equilibrium point, the point at which all derivatives are equal to zero but that is not the origin, can be found by inverting the interaction matrix and multiplying by the unit column vector, and is equal to

formula_9

Note that there are always equilibrium points, but all others have at least one species&#x27; population equal to zero.

The eigenvalues of the system at this point are 0.0414Â±0.1903&quot;i&quot;, â0.3342, and â1.0319. This point is unstable due to the positive value of the real part of the complex eigenvalue pair. If the real part were negative, this point would be stable and the orbit would attract asymptotically. The transition between these two states, where the real part of the complex eigenvalue pair is equal to zero, is called a Hopf bifurcation.

A detailed study of the parameter dependence of the dynamics was performed by Roques and Chekroun in. 
The authors observed that interaction and growth parameters leading respectively to extinction of three species, or coexistence of two, three or four species, are for the most part arranged in large regions with clear boundaries. As predicted by the theory, chaos was also found; taking place however over much smaller islands of the parameter space which causes difficulties in the identification of their location by a random search algorithm. These regions where chaos occurs are, in the three cases analyzed in, situated at the interface between a non-chaotic four species region and a region where extinction occurs. This implies a high sensitivity of biodiversity with respect to parameter variations in the chaotic regions. Additionally, in regions where extinction occurs which are adjacent to chaotic regions, the computation of local Lyapunov exponents revealed that a possible cause of extinction is the overly strong fluctuations in species abundances induced by local chaos.

==Spatial arrangements==
===Background===
There are many situations where the strength of species&#x27; interactions depends on the physical distance of separation. Imagine bee colonies in a field. They will compete for food strongly with the colonies located near to them, weakly with further colonies, and not at all with colonies that are far away. This doesn&#x27;t mean, however, that those far colonies can be ignored. There is a transitive effect that permeates through the system. If colony &quot;A&quot; interacts with colony &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;B&quot; with &quot;C&quot;, then &quot;C&quot; affects &quot;A&quot; through &quot;B&quot;. Therefore, if the competitive LotkaâVolterra equations are to be used for modeling such a system, they must incorporate this spatial structure.

===Matrix organization===
One possible way to incorporate this spatial structure is to modify the nature of the LotkaâVolterra equations to something like a 
reactionâdiffusion system. It is much easier, however, to keep the format of the equations the same and instead modify the interaction matrix. For simplicity, consider a five species example where all of the species are aligned on a circle, and each interacts only with the two neighbors on either side with strength and respectively. Thus, species 3 interacts only with species 2 and 4, species 1 interacts only with species 2 and 5, etc. The interaction matrix will now be
formula_10

If each species is identical in its interactions with neighboring species, then each row of the matrix is just a permutation of the first row. A simple, but non-realistic, example of this type of system has been characterized by Sprott &quot;et al.&quot; The coexisting equilibrium point for these systems has a very simple form given by the inverse of the sum of the row
formula_11

===Lyapunov functions===
A Lyapunov function is a function of the system whose existence in a system demonstrates stability. It is often useful to imagine a Lyapunov function as the energy of the system. If the derivative of the function is equal to zero for some orbit not including the equilibrium point, then that orbit is a stable attractor, but it must be either a limit cycle or &quot;n&quot;-torus - but not a strange attractor (this is because the largest Lyapunov exponent of a limit cycle and &quot;n&quot;-torus are zero while that of a strange attractor is positive). If the derivative is less than zero everywhere except the equilibrium point, then the equilibrium point is a stable fixed point attractor. When searching a dynamical system for non-fixed point attractors, the existence of a Lyapunov function can help eliminate regions of parameter space where these dynamics are impossible.

The spatial system introduced above has a Lyapunov function that has been explored by Wildenberg &quot;et al.&quot; If all species are identical in their spatial interactions, then the interaction matrix is circulant. The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix are given by
formula_12

for and where formula_13 the &quot;N&quot;th root of unity. Here is the &quot;j&quot;th value in the first row of the circulant matrix.

The Lyapunov function exists if the real part of the eigenvalues are positive ( for ). Consider the system where , , , and . The Lyapunov function exists if
formula_14
for . Now, instead of having to integrate the system over thousands of time steps to see if any dynamics other than a fixed point attractor exist, one need only determine if the Lyapunov function exists (note: the absence of the Lyapunov function doesn&#x27;t guarantee a limit cycle, torus, or chaos).

Example: Let , , and . If then all eigenvalues are negative and the only attractor is a fixed point. If then the real part of one of the complex eigenvalue pair becomes positive and there is a strange attractor. The disappearance of this Lyapunov function coincides with a Hopf bifurcation.

===Line systems and eigenvalues===
It is also possible to arrange the species into a line. The interaction matrix for this system is very similar to that of a circle except the interaction terms in the lower left and upper right of the matrix are deleted (those that describe the interactions between species 1 and &quot;N&quot;, etc.).

formula_15

This change eliminates the Lyapunov function described above for the system on a circle, but most likely there are other Lyapunov functions that have not been discovered.

The eigenvalues of the circle system plotted in the complex plane form a trefoil shape. The eigenvalues from a short line form a sideways Y, but those of a long line begin to resemble the trefoil shape of the circle. This could be due to the fact that a long line is indistinguishable from a circle to those species far from the ends.

<doc id="1291812" wikidata="Q611498" url="?curid=1291812" title="On a Plain">
<text>&quot;On a Plain&quot; is a song by American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the 11th track on their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, released in September 1991.

The song was released as a promo single in 1992, peaking at number 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart.

==Early history==
Written in 1990, &quot;On a Plain&quot; was first recorded in the studio on January 1, 1991, at Music Source Studios in Seattle, Washington, by the band&#x27;s audio engineer, Craig Montgomery. The private session, the band&#x27;s first with drummer Dave Grohl, led to the versions of &quot;Even in His Youth&quot; and &quot;Aneurysm&quot; that were released as B-sides on the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; single in September 1991. However, the other five songs recorded during the session all featured unfinished lyrics and scratch vocals, such as &quot;On a Plain,&quot; or were instrumental.

==&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
The song was re-recorded for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, by Butch Vig in May 1991 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. Vig later called it &quot;a great pop song,&quot; remembering it as &quot;a really new one&quot; that &quot;took a few takes&quot; to complete. The final lyrics were written at Sound City shortly before the vocals were recorded, which led to the line, &quot;What the hell am I trying to say?&quot;

The recording features wordless backing vocals by Grohl. Vig had wanted to end the recording with Grohl&#x27;s harmonies repeated four times a capella, and originally mixed the song that way, but upon hearing the mix, Cobain decided the song should end after only one pass of the harmonies. Cobain&#x27;s lead vocals were done in one take.

&quot;On a Plain&quot; was debuted live on May 29, 1991, at Jabberjaw in Los Angeles, California, the show at which Nirvana also debuted the future &quot;Nevermind&quot; single, &quot;Come As You Are&quot;, before &quot;an astonished audience,&quot; according to author Charles R. Cross. The show was Nirvana&#x27;s first since completing work on &quot;Nevermind.&quot;

Cobain ultimately expressed dissatisfaction with the &quot;Nevermind&quot; recording, telling &quot;Flipside&quot;, &quot;That song came out way too clean. I&#x27;m not happy with the way that came out at all. It should have been a lot rawer; we play it a lot better live I think.&quot;

&quot;On a Plain&quot; was released as a promo single in the summer of 1992, and became a moderate hit.

==Post-&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
&quot;On a Plain&quot; was performed during Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; appearance at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993. This version featured Pat Smear on second guitar and Lori Goldston on cello.

The song was performed for the final time live at Nirvana&#x27;s last concert, at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Music===
&quot;On a Plain&quot; was recorded in the key of E major, with Cobain&#x27;s guitar tuned to drop D. The song starts with a noise intro played by Cobain, with an audible handclap. After a short pause the main riff comes in with the power chords D5-G5-F5-E5-F5-E5-D5 played twice then followed by the power chords D5-C5-B5-A5 followed by the first progression again. The chord progressions are played twice for all verses followed by the power chords D5-Gsus2-Bbsus2 for all choruses. After the second chorus a bridge is played with the power chords F5-E5-A5-G5. The song then goes onto the third verse followed by a final chorus which is treated as the outro with the words, &quot;I&#x27;m on a plain/I can&#x27;t complain&quot; being repeated multiple times until all instruments and main vocals start fading out until the last thing that&#x27;s heard is the repeating, wordless vocal harmony from the chorus.
===Lyrics===
In a July 1993 interview in New York City, Cobain told English journalist Jon Savage that &quot;On a Plain&quot; was about &quot;classic alienation, I guess,&quot; although he then noted he had to change his explanation every time he was asked about the meaning to his songs, saying that his lyrics were largely taken from &quot;pieces of poetry thrown together,&quot; and that his poetry was &quot;not usually thematic at all.&quot;

The lyric &quot;Don&#x27;t quote me on that&quot; was a reference to a recurring joke at Sound City around the time it was written. As Grohl explained to biographer Michael Azerrad, &quot;Someone would say something like, &#x27;Where&#x27;s the mayonnaise?&#x27; And someone else would answer, &#x27;It&#x27;s in the fridge, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.

In his 1993 book &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Azerrad wrote that the lyric &quot;My mother died every night&quot; was a reference to an abusive relationship Cobain&#x27;s mother was in while Cobain was a teenager. Azerrad also suggested that the &quot;black sheep&quot; in the song was a reference to Cobain himself.

The lyric &quot;One more special message to go&quot; referred to the fact that &quot;On a Plain&quot; was the last song on &quot;Nevermind&quot; that Cobain had to complete lyrics for.

Emily Parker of &quot;NME&quot; described &quot;On a Plain&quot; as &quot;Kurt&#x27;s most meta moment: a song written about writing a song.&quot;

==Reception==
In her review of &quot;Nevermind&quot; for &quot;Spin&quot;, Lauren Spencer cited the &quot;beautifully harmonic&quot; &quot;On a Plain&quot; as one of the songs &quot;you be humming...for the rest of your life.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;On a Plain&quot; was listed at number 26 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 2015 ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.

In 2017, to mark what would have been Kurt Cobain&#x27;s 50th birthday, the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the top 20 most played Nirvana songs on the TV and radio in the United Kingdom in which &quot;On a Plain&quot; was ranked at number 10.

<text>The music of Alaska (IÃ±upiaq: &quot;Alaaskam atuutiÅit&quot;) is a broad artistic field incorporating many cultures in the U.S. state of Alaska.

==History and overview==

Alaska&#x27;s original music belongs to the Inupiaq, Aleut, Tlingit, and other Alaska Native communities. Russian, English and Irish immigrants brought their own varieties of folk music. Alaska was home to some of the United States&#x27; renowned performers, such as the singer Jewel (who had two No. 2 Hot 100 hits, including &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; and &quot;Foolish Games&quot;), and Hobo Jim, who was legislatively declared &quot;Alaska&#x27;s state balladeer&quot;. Traditional Aleut flautist Mary Youngblood, singer-songwriter Libby Roderick, the traditional performing group Pamyua, and performing artist Karrie Pavish Anderson also identify as Alaskan. Alaska also has a prominent metal and rock scene. Metalcore band 36 Crazyfists originated in Alaska, as did indie rock bands Portugal. The Man and the Builders and the Butchers.

==Music festivals and ensembles==

===Folk===
The Alaska Folk Festival, held in early April in Juneau is among the state&#x27;s most well-attended music festivals. The Fairbanks Folk Fest annual &quot;Summer and Winter Music Fests&quot; and the Anchorage Folk Festival are also well known in their areas. The Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival, also held in Fairbanks (since 1983) is described &quot;a testament to the far-reaching appeal of traditional music&quot; in the &quot;Country Music Lover&#x27;s Guide to the U.S.A.&quot;; the festival features Athabascan and Inuit fiddlers.

===Classical===
The most prominent symphony orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra. The Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra has served the Interior since 1958, and its traveling arm, the Arctic Chamber Orchestra, regularly tours rural Alaska, as well as occasional international trips. The Juneau Symphony is another notable institution which was founded in 1962. Youth orchestras include the Anchorage Youth Symphony.

Alaska also is home to a notable chamber music festivals, including the Sitka Music Festival Alaska&#x27;s premier chamber music presenter who has presented in over 42 Alaskan communities with the mission of providing the finest classical Music experience in Alaska through performance and education. The festival is led by Grammy-winning cellist, Zuill Bailey and presents over 30 of the world&#x27;s leading classical musicians in Alaska each year. 

Alaska is also home to the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival, and the Anchorage Chamber Music Festival. The Juneau Jazz &amp; Classics Festival is a 10-day annual event, offering both formal and informal concerts in classical, jazz and blues music, including workshops for musicians of all ages, youth concerts, outreach activities, and community interaction with the featured artists.

===Opera===
The Anchorage Opera is currently the state&#x27;s only professional opera company, however there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well. The Juneau Lyric Opera, a volunteer company, was founded in 1974 and presents concerts, choral workshops, and fully staged opera in Juneau and Southeast Alaska.

===Country===
Country music in Alaska is very popular, in part due to the influx of oilfield employment from the southern US. Popular local groups include the Ken Peltier Band.

===Rap===

Alaska began to see a flourishing scene of underground rappers in the late 1990s and early 2000s as the state&#x27;s black population began to grow steadily. Despite the increase in crime and the presence of drug trafficking, numerous artists began to see their music flourish in both Black and Pacific Islander communities as Alaska became a melting pot of urban culture from the influx of residents from the continental United States.

===Rock===
The Anchorage community organizes several festival shows each summer, usually at Cuddy Family Park&#x27;s small amphitheater. The festivals typically feature performances by local punk, rock, and metal bands, although groups specializing in other genres such as rockabilly and noise have also made appearances. The shows are loosely organized and community driven. Non-musical attractions have included circus acts, auctions, barbecues, and bike sports. Festivals are typically given a unique nickname, rather than sharing a common title (e.g. &quot;Anchorage Festival of Unpopular Music&quot; or &quot;Bunk Rock Picnic&quot;). Some notable local bands include Nervus Rex, I Like Robots, Danger Money, who, in 2017 and 2020 were voted best cover band in Alaska by readers of the Anchorage Press; and 2019 and 2020 by the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot;. Members of that band also perform as an acoustic-pop duo, Danger &amp; Diva.

===Acoustic pop===
Rebel Blues are a 3-piece acoustic blues band whose music is based around acoustic guitar. Danger &amp; Diva perform contemporary pop/rock on acoustic guitar, including unusual arrangements of songs by the likes of Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, Adele, Lady Gaga, and the like. They are a spin-off of the band Danger Money (Bill Little and Jennifer Brown).

===More history===

The first big flowering of rock (and specifically punk rock and alternative) was in the early 1980s with the arrival of Skate Death, and their contemporaries the Clyng-Onz and Psychedelic Skeletons.

In the 1990s the alternative band the Drunk Poets influenced the Alaskan music scene.

Anchorage is home to several over 21 and all ages venues including Chilkoot Charlie&#x27;s, the Tap Root public house, and the Paddleboat Cafe.

Wasilla also has a thriving night life with several venues to choose from. The Rock Music &amp; Sports Grill features many local bands and draws an interesting mix of performers for open mic shows. New to Wasilla is Club Hydro at the Mat-Su Resort, where local and out of state bands have been able to bring their talent to Alaska. Four Corners, MugShot, and Chepos also provide live entertainment.

Fairbanks has been the home of a wealth of bands of an incredible variety, especially considering its small population, such as Paper Scissors, Work, Granddad, the Avery Wolves, Rebecca K. File, Joe Ransdell-Green, You&#x27;re Fired, Slow and Painful, Say Yes, Annie Where the Sun Don&#x27;t Shine, Eating for Two, Mr. McFeely, 37SCDW and Searching for the Real. Feeding Frenzy and Young Fangs were part of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 States Project&quot; and received shining reviews. The Scurvies are an Alaska legend and have gone to tour the Lower 48, accumulating a die-hard national following.

The Summer Meltdown festival is an all day, out doors festival in Anchorage featuring mostly local acts in metal, rock and occasionally hip-hop. The Alaskan band 36 Crazyfists have headlined the festival since its inception in 2005 along with other acts, such as Twelve Tribes and Subconscious, with the exception of 2008 when Poison the Well and MxPx headlined the festival, marking the first time 36 Crazyfists has not headlined.

Ignite Alaska was a music festival in Fairbanks, Alaska. It lasted two days featuring headliners such as Thousand Foot Krutch, Red, and Manafest as well as local bands from Anchorage and Fairbanks. It was a Christ-based festival with a speaker, Blaise Foret, and a band leading worship songs. This event was held at the Carlson Center.

Missing in Alaska (2011â2017), a metalcore band in San Antonio, Texas, has based their name on the state.

===Clucking Blossom===
There have been five Clucking Blossom Festivals held in Fairbanks in May 2005â2009. Though not related to the Angry Young and Poor Festival, some individuals who were involved in Angry Young and Poor became associated with the Clucking Blossom Festival because the scene is tightly knit. One of the ideas that fuels Clucking Blossom is to allow all the bands in Fairbanks to share a stage, combining acoustic music, bluegrass, punk, hip-hop, metal and rock bands. This also gave people under 21 a chance to see bands that usually only perform in bars, as Fairbanks has an unfortunate few venues for live music. The event is open to everyone and there are events planned specifically for young children, as well as political presentations, a parade, (loosely) organized discussions and public art of all kinds.

===Make-a-Scene!===
Make-a-Scene! (or MaS!) was an Alaskan music venue located in Wasilla. Make-a-Scene! also held annual summer music festivals for several years. MaS! is also known in the Mat-Su Valley for its publication, &quot;Make-a-Scene! Magazine&quot;, which focuses on Alaskan musicians, poetry, art, politics and film.

==CBS Sports Network==
CBS Sports Network is a sports-oriented American digital cable and satellite channel that is operated by Paramount Global through CBS Sports. Launched as the National College Sports Network in 2002, then renamed as College Sports Television in 2003, CBS&#x27;s then-parent company Viacom acquired the network in 2005 and later renamed it CBS College Sports Network in 2008. The network had always focused on college sports, but in 2011, CBS rebranded the network as CBS Sports Network as a move to reposition the network to include mainstream sportsâincluding coverage of minor professional sports leagues such as the Arena Football League and Major League Lacrosse, although college sports are still aired frequently by the network.

==CBS Sports Radio==

CBS Sports Radio was a sports radio network that launched on September 4, 2012, with hourly sports news updates. It began offering a full 24-hour schedule of sports talk programming on January 2, 2013. CBS Sports Radio was originally owned by CBS Radio, with Westwood One handling distribution and marketing of the network. Sports radio stations that were owned by Entercom (now Audacy) and Cumulus Media carried part of the full schedule of programming, while eight Entercom-owned stations carry network programming throughout the day. In addition to carriage on terrestrial stations, CBS Sports Radio streamed its programming on the internet. CBS issued a cease and desist order in early April 2024 to all remaining affiliates informing them to cease using the CBS trademark by April 15 (CBS Radio had merged with Entercom in 2017 and CBS/Paramount Global has allowed use of the CBS name and Eyemark logo under a limited license to expire in late 2037; it withdrew permission for the use of the Eyemark by CBSSR at the end of 2019). Since then, Audacy has owned and operated the remnants of the network under the brand Infinity Sports Network, utilizing the name of a forerunner company, Infinity Broadcasting.

==CBS Sports HQ==
On February 26, 2018, CBS Sports launched CBS Sports HQ, a 24-hour streaming sports news channel modeled after CBS News&#x27;s streaming news channel.

== CBS Sports Digital ==
The online arm of CBS Sports is CBSSports.com. CBS purchased SportsLine.com in 2004, and today CBSSports.com is part of Paramount Streaming. On February 26, 2018, following up on the success of their online news network CBSN, CBS Sports launched CBS Sports HQ, a 24/7, online only, linear sports news network. The network focuses entirely on sports news, results, highlights and analysis. (CBS Sports college sports and golf programming that it distributes over the air is generally made available for free via separate streams, as are a limited number of NFL national telecasts; the remainder requires a Paramount+ (formerly CBS All Access) subscription to be viewed online, with CBS Sports Network programming requiring a TV Everywhere subscription.)

==Branding==
On August 31, 2013, CBS Sports rolled out its previous graphics and animation package that was first used in the network&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XLVII. Additionally, in compliance with the Active Format Description #10 code, CBS Sports switched to a 16:9 aspect ratio letterbox presentation used for all sports programming, including the &quot;SEC on CBS&quot; and the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; broadcasts.

On November 30, 2015, CBS Sports unveiled a new rectangular logo, which premiered on-air during its coverage of Super Bowl 50, and was intended to provide consistency between the division&#x27;s platforms. It replaced an existing logo that had dated back to 1981. In October 2020, CBS announced that all of its major divisions would adopt a unified branding scheme built around the components of the CBS eye logo, a new sonic branding, and TT Norms Pro as a corporate typeface. The implementation of the branding by CBS Sports launched during the lead-up to Super Bowl LV, which introduced a new on-air graphics package that conforms to the corporate design language.

<text>Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Cemetery is a cemetery located in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is noted for the several important historical figures that are interred in its grounds.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==History==
The first cemetery of Saint Paul&#x27;s Church (Protestant Episcopal) in Baltimore was located at the future intersection of Sollers Road and North Point Road in what is now the area of Dundalk in southeastern Baltimore County. The original small church of St. Paul&#x27;s Parish of the established Church of England was one of the &quot;Original Thirty&quot; parishes designated for the colonial Province of Maryland and was founded in 1692 and considered to be one of the oldest churches in the State. In 1730, the Parish Church of St. Paul&#x27;s was moved from near Colgate Creek on the &quot;Patapsco Neck&quot; peninsula to the new burgeoning town of Baltimore overlooking &quot;The Basin&quot; at the head of the Patapsco River on its Northwest Branch, and Lot #19 was purchased in the &quot;Original Survey&quot; of that year by county surveyor Phillip Jones from Charles Carroll of Annapolis.

As the designated parish for the new Baltimore County, which then included most of northeastern Maryland when it was &quot;erected&quot; (established) in 1659, the first St. Paul&#x27;s was located around the vicinity of the lower Colgate Creek which flowed into the Patapsco River and is assumed that the cemetery would be located somewhere nearby. The church site was probably in the area of the future aviation sites of &quot;Logan Field&quot;, &quot;Baltimore Municipal Airport&quot; (later known as &quot;Harbor Field&quot; after World War II), and now the grounds of the &quot;Dundalk Marine Terminal&quot; and &quot;Sea Girt Marine Terminal&quot; of the facilities for the Port of Baltimore Laid out in 1692, along with the Parish, this churchyard is the oldest cemetery that is known to have existed in the Baltimore metropolitan area.

About 1760, those remains were exhumed and moved to the new Saint Paul&#x27;s Burial Ground which surrounded the original church, which was the first building in the new town to be built of brick and completed after 9 years of work in 1739 at Forest Street (now North Charles Street) and the intersecting eastâwest lane which later became East Saratoga Street after the American Revolution to commemorate the famous &quot;turning point&quot; battle in 1777 along the Hudson River in New York State. To the east lay the Jones Falls Bluffs which stood from 1739 to 1817, over the southwestward &quot;loop&quot; of the stream before its course was further north. Below the cliffs was another lane which was named for the church as &quot;Saint Paul&#x27;s Lane&quot; (to become St. Paul Street and in the southern portion after construction of the terraced &quot;Preston Gardens&quot; in the 1920s, became known as Saint Paul Place. To the south at the then limit of the lot was laid out New Church Street which later became East and West Lexington Streets (also after the Revolution), one block south of the later church buildings. That building was replaced by another in (1812, 1813â17?) of Greek Revival design by famous local architect Robert Cary Long, Jr. which burned in 1854 and was later replaced by the present building in 1856 which fills that entire property, at the current intersection of North Charles and East Saratoga Streets.

In the late 18th century, the Vestry of Old St. Paul&#x27;s Church was faced with the need for a third cemetery. Cemeteries had never been viewed as good neighbors, aside from the fact that they contained the bodies and souls of the departed (who, it was believed, had the ability to wander the land), they could become unsightly and even unhealthy.

Therefore, a new cemetery site was purchased in 1800 on the western edge of town. This site is bordered on the west by Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (Cove Street at the time of purchase, later Fremont Avenue), Lombard Street on the south, and Redwood Street (formerly German Street) on the north. Several members of the Vestry owned a great deal of undeveloped property in this area.

Church member Samuel Smythe purchased 2.8 acres (11,000 m2) of land from the heirs of Alexander Robinson, whose house is found on the 1802 &quot;Hanna and Warner&quot; map of Baltimore, directly across German Street from the Smythe purchase. The land was subsequently bought by the Church. Many of the parishioners immediately bought grave lots and began construction of vaults and plots.

When Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard was constructed, during the mid-1980s, one end of this cemetery was lost on the west side and the remains and markers were moved within the remaining walled cemetery that now sits surrounded by the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus.

<doc id="1291826" wikidata="Q7752981" url="?curid=1291826" title="The NFL Today">
<text>The NFL Today is an American football television program on CBS that serves as the pre-game show for the network&#x27;s National Football League (NFL) game telecasts under the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; brand. The program features commentary on the latest news around the NFL from its hosts and studio analysts, as well as predictions for the day&#x27;s games and interviews with players and coaches. Originally debuting as &quot;Pro Football Kickoff&quot; on September 17, 1961, the program airs before all NFL games broadcast by CBS (usually on Sundays at 12:00Â p.m. Eastern Time Zone), and generally runs for one hour (except for Thanksgiving and during the postseason when it is generally 30 minutes). The program&#x27;s commentators also provide commentary during game updates, the halftime reports, and the postgame show on the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; broadcasts at the conclusion of single early games and, if time permits, late games.

Since 2024, the crew consists of longtime sportscaster James Brown, who has served as the host of The NFL Today since 2006; former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher; former Seattle Seahawks, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions wide receiver Nate Burleson; Houston Texans former defensive end J. J. Watt; and Atlanta Falcons former quarterback Matt Ryan serving as analysts.

&quot;The NFL Today&quot; broadcasts from Studio 43 at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City; however, the program will occasionally broadcast from the game site for the AFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl. The pregame telecast of the Super Bowl has sometimes been branded as &quot;The Super Bowl Today&quot;.

From 2014 to 2017, CBS partnered with the NFL Network to air selected &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games; the &quot;NFL GameDay&quot; crew has appeared in segments on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; for both Thursdays and Sundays (and Saturdays when applicable).

==Broadcast history==
===Dawn of the pregame format (1961â1974)===
The program began on September 17, , when CBS debuted the first remote 15-minute pre-game show, the first of its kind on network sports television. Originally titled Pro Football Kickoff, hosted by Johnny Lujack, the program originated from NFL stadiums around the country with a comprehensive look at the day&#x27;s games. This show was succeeded in and by NFL Kickoff, with Kyle Rote serving as its host.

On September 13, , Frank Gifford began hosting the renamed NFL Report, which was subsequently retitled The NFL Today later that season. This version of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; was a 15-minute, regional sports program that presented interviews with NFL players and coaches, and news and features about the league. In , &quot;The NFL Today&quot; expanded to a 30-minute format preceding game coverage.

On September 20, , &quot;The NFL Today&quot; signed industry-pioneering women: Marjorie Margolies (later elected to Congress from Pennsylvania in 1992) produced and reported features, and actress Carole Howey, who also reported for the program.

In , Jack Whitaker and Pat Summerall took over hosting duties on the program from Gifford, who left CBS to call play-by-play on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. In , &quot;The NFL Today&quot; began originating from CBS&#x27; New York City studios; the program also began to include reports from stadiums around the country, although it continued to be pre-recorded before each week&#x27;s game day.

For , CBS abandoned the pre-recorded &quot;NFL Today&quot; broadcast and its short-form wrap-up show, Pro Football Report, for a live, wraparound style program titled The NFL on CBS. It started a half-hour prior to kickoff of either the singleheader or doubleheader telecast (12:30, 1:30, or 3:30Â p.m. Eastern). On September 15, the revamped program debuted with a new three-segment format: the first featured highlights of the day&#x27;s games and commentary, special features shot during the week were broadcast during the second segment, and the third covered the day&#x27;s sports news, including scores and highlights at halftime. The program&#x27;s hosts were Whitaker (who was brought into the studio after quite a few years serving as a play-by-play announcer for the network&#x27;s NFL broadcasts) and Lee Leonard.

The program broke ground in a number of ways: it was the first live pre-game show, the first to show halftime highlights of other games televised by CBS, and the first to wrap up as a post-game show. CBS also began referring its stadium studios or its pre-game set, previously known as &quot;CBS Control,&quot; as the &quot;CBS Sports Center&quot;. The program also no longer featured a third member of the on-air crew stationed at CBS Control to provide scores, halftime information and â time permitting â post-game interviews, a position often held by Dick Stockton during his early days at the network.

===Musburger, George and Cross (1975â1989)===
The program reinstated its previous &quot;NFL Today&quot; title on the September 21, 1975 broadcast, with former WBBM-TV and KCBS-TV sportscaster/anchorman Brent Musburger (previously a play-by-play announcer for CBS) serving as host, former NFL player Irv Cross as an analyst, and former Miss America Phyllis George as one of the reporters. That year, the program won 13 Emmy Awards. Sports bookie Jimmy Snyder, nicknamed &quot;The Greek,&quot; joined the program in 1976. Jack Whitaker also contributed to the program as an occasional reporter and essayist during this period. It was during this period that &quot;The NFL Today&quot; began an 18-year run as the highest-rated program in its time slot, lasting until the network lost the broadcast rights to Fox in 1994, the longest consecutive run for a television program in a consistent time slot.

By this time, the program began the complex process of producing three separate live pre-game, halftime and postgame programs for 1:00Â p.m., 2:00Â p.m. (through 1981) and 4:00Â p.m. (Eastern Time) games. Also for the first time, signature musical pieces are produced for NFL coverage. The show&#x27;s signature theme was &quot;Horizontal Hold,&quot; a piece by Jan Stoeckart (recorded under his pseudonym of Jack Trombey). &quot;The NFL Today&quot; was among the recipients of the Sports Emmy Awards in its inaugural event in 1979.

Phyllis George was replaced by former Miss Ohio USA Jayne Kennedy beginning with the 1978 NFL season, before George returned to the program for the 1980 NFL season. George was replaced on the program by Charlsie Cantey midway into the 1983 NFL season, after going on parental leave, with George ultimately departing the program outright. Jimmy Snyder was dismissed by CBS Sports on January 16, 1988, one day after making comments about racial differences among NFL players on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Musburger announced Snyder&#x27;s dismissal on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; prior to the Minnesota Vikings-Washington Redskins NFC Championship Game the next day. Snyder&#x27;s slot on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; would subsequently be filled by Dick Butkus for the next two seasons.

===Gumbel and Bradshaw (1990â1993)===
After the 1989 NFL season, Musburger was abruptly fired on April 1, 1990, following a power shift at CBS (he later resurfaced at ABC), while Cross was demoted to the position of game analyst. They were replaced by former ESPN football analyst and WFAN morning host Greg Gumbel (brother of then-&quot;Today&quot; co-host Bryant Gumbel), legendary former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw and longtime sportswriter Lesley Visser, bringing a female reporter back to &quot;The NFL Today&quot; for the first time since Super Bowl XVIII.

On December 18, 1993, the NFL awarded Fox a four-year contract (worth $1.58 billion) for the broadcast television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC), allowing that network to carry regular season and playoff games from the conference starting with the 1994 NFL season (which it continues to this day). The deal stripped CBS of NFL telecasts following the 1993 NFL season after 38 years; as a result, &quot;The NFL Today&quot; ended its original run and CBS aired its final NFC telecast on January 23, 1994.

After CBS lost the NFL rights, Greg Gumbel went to NBC Sports, Terry Bradshaw left to become an analyst for Fox&#x27;s new pre-game show &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; and Lesley Visser joined ABC as a sideline reporter for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;; Gumbel and Visser eventually returned to CBS.

===CBS reacquires rights (1998âpresent)===
&quot;The NFL Today&quot; made its return to CBS in 1998, after the network signed a contract with the NFL to acquire the broadcast rights to televise games from the American Football Conference (AFC) effective with that year&#x27;s NFL season, taking over the rights from NBC.

====Under Jim Nantz (1998â2003)====
In the months before CBS began its AFC broadcast contract, former &quot;NFL Today&quot; host Greg Gumbel rejoined CBS from NBC to serve as the lead play-by-play announcer for the NFL game; while Jim Nantz was named as the studio host for &quot;The NFL Today&quot; (incidentally, during the 1993 season, Nantz filled in for predecessor Gumbel on the program, as the latter was helming the broadcast team for CBS&#x27; coverage of the American League Championship Series alongside Jim Kaat). Newcomer Bonnie Bernstein joined CBS as a reporter for &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, before being moved to a sideline reporting role for the 1999 NFL season. Bernstein eventually returned to the show in 2004, before leaving again in 2005.

&quot;The NFL Today&quot; returned on September 6, 1998, 1,687 days since the program&#x27;s last broadcast under the previous NFL contract, with Nantz welcoming back viewers to CBS for its coverage of the NFL. In addition to Nantz as host, the relaunched program&#x27;s original lineup of studio analysts consisted of Marcus Allen, Brent Jones and George Seifert. Seifert was let go during the season, while Allen and Jones were not retained. Craig James (a former studio analyst for CBS&#x27; &quot;SEC on CBS&quot; pre-game show), Randy Cross (a former color commentator for CBS and NBC) and Jerry Glanville (a former analyst for &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;) were brought in to replace Allen, Jones, and Seifert alongside Nantz on the pre-game show the next season. As a prelude, James and Cross joined Nantz, Jones, and Allen for the pregame show before the AFC Championship Game during the previous season.

During this time, the program introduced new segments such as &quot;Chalk Talk&quot; (in which commentators and program guests discuss team strategies), and &quot;Outside the Huddle&quot; (featuring commentary mocking about people around the NFL provided by PUNT TV pregame host &quot;Thurston Long,&quot; a computer-animated character.) &quot;Outside the Huddle&quot; was later dropped after Viacom decided to split into two companies â CBS Corporation (a restructuring of the original Viacom, which retained CBS, among other assets that included Showtime Networks and UPN) and a new company with the Viacom name (which acquired assets including Paramount Pictures and MTV Networks).

Lesley Visser returned to CBS Sports/&quot;The NFL Today&quot; for the 2000 NFL season after a six-year hiatus, serving as a feature reporter for the program. Visser left &quot;The NFL Today&quot; in 2004 to work as the lead reporter for top NFL games. She returned to the program two years later in 2006. Also during the 2000 season, former Chicago Bears and New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka joined the program as an analyst; Deion Sanders was added as an analyst in 2001.
For the 2000 NFL season, the program moved part-time from the CBS Broadcast Center to a new outdoor studio on the site of the General Motors Building, on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan. The set, which was used during the fall, was set up on Sunday mornings at a plaza in the area near the building that later became the glass structure of the Apple Fifth Avenue store, next to the southeast corner of Central Park. During the winter, &quot;The NFL Today&quot; was broadcast indoors from Studio 43 at the CBS Broadcast Center.

The program was rebooted again after the 2001 season with Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason joining Nantz and Sanders. Sanders left the broadcast team after Super Bowl XXXVIII to return to the NFL, playing for the Baltimore Ravens until 2004. Nantz followed shortly thereafter, being promoted to lead play-by-play broadcaster.

At the start of the 2003 NFL season, CBS Sports introduced &quot;Posthumus Zone&quot; as the new theme music for &quot;The NFL Today&quot; and for the network&#x27;s NFL game telecasts. The song was composed by Los Angeles electronica group E.S. Posthumus, so named because it composes songs that have no-longer-existing ancient cities as a motif. In 2006, &quot;Posthumus Zone&quot; and a remixed version titled &quot;Rise to Glory&quot; were included as tracks on the group&#x27;s second CD release, &quot;Rise to Glory&quot;. The song &quot;Rise to Glory&quot; was also featured on &quot;The NFL Today&quot; and on CBS&#x27; NFL broadcasts during the 2005 NFL season.

====Second tenure of Greg Gumbel (2004â2005)====
With Nantz moving to the lead broadcast team alongside Phil Simms, Gumbel returned to the studio to replace him on &quot;The NFL Today&quot;. Shannon Sharpe also joined the team to replace Sanders as an analyst. Sharpe&#x27;s critics said that his broadcasting skills were hurt by his poor grammar and enunciation of words (Sharpe has a very noticeable lisp and drawl). This was parodied in a satire article in &quot;The Onion&quot; with the headline, &quot;CBS Producers Ask Shannon Sharpe To Use At Least 3 Real Words Per Sentence.&quot;

The outdoor set was abandoned for the 2005 NFL season, with &quot;The NFL Today&quot; broadcasting from Studio 43 for the entire season. The following season (2006 NFL season), &quot;The NFL Today&quot; began broadcasting in high-definition television; the program introduced a new HD-ready set at Studio 43 with the conversion.

====Under James Brown (2006âpresent)====

On February 6, 2006, CBS Sports announced the return of James Brown, who left CBS eleven years earlier to become studio host of &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;, to the network as the host of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; beginning with the 2006 NFL season. Greg Gumbel moved back to play-by-play duties, teaming with Dan Dierdorf as part of its secondary announcing team, replacing Dick Enberg.

Lesley Visser returned to &quot;The NFL Today&quot; after a two-year hiatus in her previous role as feature reporter, a position she continues to hold to this day; meanwhile, Bonnie Bernstein left the network to pursue other broadcasting opportunities. Aside from Visser returning to the show, Sam Ryan joined CBS Sports in June 2006, as a reporter for &quot;The NFL Today&quot;; Ryan left the network after the 2010 NFL season. In 2007, CBS added a fifth member to its studio analyst table by adding then-recently retired head coach Bill Cowher.

In 2012, following the murder-suicide of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher and his girlfriend, Brown digressed on the program about the role that men needed to take in the fight against domestic violence. He accused the league&#x27;s players of letting the NFL&#x27;s reputation on domestic violence go unchanged.

Beginning with the 2013 NFL season, &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, along with all other CBS Sports presentations, switched to a 16x9 widescreen presentation that extended or placed graphics outside of the 4:3 safe area, with the network requiring cable television providers to use the #10 Active Format Description tag to present the broadcasts in a letterboxing format for viewers watching a CBS station&#x27;s standard-definition television feed.

On February 18, 2014, CBS Sports announced that Sharpe and Marino were being relieved of their duties as on-air commentators, to be replaced by Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott.

On February 5, 2014, the NFL announced that a deal with CBS to broadcast Thursday night games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season games beginning the 2014 NFL season in simulcast with NFL Network, with the remainder airing on NFL Network exclusively. With the addition of the package, CBS announced an additional &quot;NFL Today&quot; broadcast for the games, to be broadcast from the site of each week&#x27;s game; with Brown and Cowher to be featured on both the Thursday and Sunday broadcasts, Deion Sanders returning to the program as an analyst for the Thursday editions, and while Esiason, Gonzalez and Scott remaining on the Sunday broadcasts.

During the first Thursday edition of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; on September 11, 2014, in the wake of the domestic violence controversy involving Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, Brown spoke via satellite to CBS News anchor Scott Pelley and spoke face-to-face with CBS News correspondent Norah O&#x27;Donnell, who had interviewed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell days before. Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti also appeared in a taped interview with Brown. During the pre-game, Brown updated his 2012 digression about domestic violence, wondering why in the two years since his initial commentary, that nothing had been done to change the problem, and how the problem had actually become worse.

On September 13, 2015 (the first time CBS had aired a Week 1 doubleheader since the NFL returned to the network 17 years earlier), &quot;The NFL Today&quot; debuted an entirely new set at Studio 43, replacing the previous set that had been used since 2006.

On September 11, 2016, &quot;The NFL Today&quot; debuted a new program logo, replacing a variation of the previous logo used since the 2006 NFL season.

Scott and Gonzalez both left &quot;The NFL Today&quot; prior to the 2017 season, with Gonzalez switching networks to join Fox&#x27;s pregame coverage. Phil Simms, who had been demoted from CBS&#x27;s lead color commentator position when the network hired Tony Romo for that post, and Nate Burleson, who comes over from NFL Network, replaced Scott and Gonzalez.

For the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the set was modified to allow for social distancing, which resulted in the temporary removal of the desk, and instead Brown, Burleson, Cowher, Esiason and Simms were seated on stools. The set returned to its normal configuration for the 2021 season.

On April 29, 2024, CBS announced that Matt Ryan would join &quot;The NFL Today&quot; as a full-time analyst. Esiason and Simms departed the network as their contracts expired at the end of the 2023 season.

==Super Bowl editions==

The NFL Today at the Super Bowl, previously known as The Super Bowl Today, is the edition of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; that precedes the Super Bowl during years when CBS has the rights to broadcast the game. The show is generally broadcast from the site of that year&#x27;s game; in Super Bowl LVIII&#x27;s case, for example, the show originated from the Las Vegas Strip, in addition to the on-site set at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, NV.

<text>The &quot;Marchioness&quot; disaster was a collision between two vessels on the River Thames in London in the early hours of 20 August 1989, which resulted in the deaths of 51 people. The pleasure boat &quot;Marchioness&quot; sank after being hit twice by the dredger at about 1:46Â am, between Cannon Street railway bridge and Southwark Bridge.

&quot;Marchioness&quot; had been hired for the evening for a birthday party and had about 130 people on board, four of whom were crew and bar staff. Both vessels were heading downstream, against the tide, &quot;Bowbelle&quot; travelling faster than the smaller vessel. Although the exact paths taken by the ships, and the precise series of events and their locations, are unknown, the subsequent inquiry considered it likely that &quot;Bowbelle&quot; struck &quot;Marchioness&quot; from the rear, causing the latter to turn to port, where she was hit again, then pushed along, turning over and being pushed under &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s bow. It took thirtyÂ seconds for &quot;Marchioness&quot; to sink; 24 bodies were found within the ship when it was raised.

An investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) blamed a lack of lookouts, but their report was criticised by the families of the victims, as the MAIB had not interviewed anyone on &quot;Marchioness&quot; or &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, but relied on police interviews. The government refused to hold an inquiry, despite pressure from the families. Douglas Henderson, the captain of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, was charged with failing to have an effective lookout on the vessel, but two cases against him ended with a hung jury. A private prosecution for manslaughter against four directors of South Coast Shipping Company, the owners of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, and corporate manslaughter against the company was dismissed because of lack of evidence.

A formal inquiry in 2000 concluded that &quot;The basic cause of the collision is clear. It was poor lookout on both vessels. Neither vessel saw the other in time to take action to avoid the collision.&quot; Criticism was also aimed at the owners of both ships, as well as the Department of Transport and the Port of London Authority. The collision and the subsequent reports led to increased safety measures on the Thames, and four new lifeboat stations were installed on the river.
==Background==
===&quot;Marchioness&quot;===
The pleasure boat &quot;Marchioness&quot; was built in 1923 by the Salter Brothers of Oxford for Joseph Mears, a businessman whose interests included running pleasure launches on the River Thames. She was long and at the beam, and measured 46.19 gross tons. She spent most of her life on the Thames, including when she was requisitioned during the Second World War by the Thames Hospital Emergency Service, when she was stationed in Dagenham. Her service included being one of the little ships that aided in the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation. &quot;Marchioness&quot; was sold to Thames Launches in 1945, when Mears&#x27;s company was wound up. She was purchased by Tidal Cruises Ltd in 1978 and the upper works were rebuilt to form an upper and lower saloon. The new upper saloon obstructed the vision from the wheelhouse, and there was, the later inquiry established, a lack of easily accessible emergency exits, particularly from the lower decks. &quot;Marchioness&quot; had seven life raftsâeach of which could support twenty peopleâand seven lifebuoysâeach of which could support two people. Registered in London, she was licensed to carry 165 passengers. From the early 1970s there was an increase in the number of boats for evening or night-time parties and discos, and &quot;Marchioness&quot; was part of this market.

&quot;Marchioness&quot; carried a crew of two: her captain was Stephen Faldo; the mate was Andrew McGowan. On the night of her sinking, she also carried two members of bar staff. Faldo and McGowan had a business partnership, Top Bar Enterprises, which provided the bar staff and drink for the party. Faldo was 29 at the time of the sinking. He had begun working on the Thames at the age of 17 and had earned his full waterman&#x27;s river licence in June 1984. He began work at Tidal Cruises in 1986 and became the permanent captain of &quot;Marchioness&quot; in 1987. He had forgotten to renew his riverman&#x27;s licence in the run-up to the night of the collision, and was technically not entitled to skipper the vessel that night. A later inquiry considered the lack of licence was &quot;a minor point because he was undoubtedly qualified to do so and could have renewed his licence by paying 50 pence&quot;. McGowan, age 21, became an apprentice to a waterman in June 1986. By February 1988 he had completed courses at the Port of London Authority for chartwork and seamanship, and obtained his apprentice licence in May 1988; he joined &quot;Marchioness&quot; as a crew member around the same time.

===&quot;Bowbelle&quot;===

The aggregate dredger was launched in 1964 by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company of Troon, Scotland. She was long and at the beam; her deadweight tonnage was and she measured 1,474.72 gross tons. &quot;Bowbelle&quot; was one of six &quot;Bow&quot; ships owned by East Coast Aggregates Limited; they were managed by South Coast Shipping Company Limited. East Coast Aggregates Limited (ECA) was part of the larger RMC Group, a concrete products company. &quot;Bowbelle&quot; had a crew of nine: a master, two mates, three engineers, two able seamen and a cook. The ship&#x27;s captain, Douglas Henderson, aged 31, undertook a Deep Sea apprenticeship until 1978 and joined ECA in November 1987, when he became second mate on &quot;Bowsprite&quot;. In May 1989 he became the master of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;.

Vessels from ECA, including &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, had previously been involved in accidents on the Thames. In July 1981 there was a collision between &quot;Bowtrader&quot; and the passenger launch &quot;Pride of Greenwich&quot;; three months later &quot;Bowtrader&quot; was involved in a collision with &quot;Hurlingham&quot;, another pleasure cruiser owned by Tidal Cruises. &quot;Bowbelle&quot; collided with Cannon Street railway bridge in May 1982 and, the following month, was nearly in a collision with a passenger boat.

At the time of the collision with &quot;Marchioness&quot;, &quot;Bowbelle&quot; was carrying aggregate and was trimmed down at the stern; this, along with the dredging equipment, limited the forward vision from the bridge. On 19 August 1989 Henderson visited several public houses over a period of three and a half hours and drank six pints (3.4 L; 120 imp fl oz) of lager. He returned to the ship at 6:00Â pm for food and a short sleep; one of the ship&#x27;s company, Terence Blayney, who acted as the forward lookout that night, was with Henderson, and drank seven pints over the same period.

===Jonathan Phang and Antonio de Vasconcellos===
&quot;Marchioness&quot; was hired for a party for the night of 19â20 August 1989. It was organised by Jonathan Phang, a photographic agent, to celebrate the 26th birthday of Antonio de Vasconcellos, who worked in a merchant bank. The pair were good friends and business partners in a photographic agency. Phang paid Â£695 to hire the boat from 1:00Â am to 6:00Â am, with extra for the hire of the disco, food and drinks. Many of those at the party were also in their twenties; some were former students and others worked in fashion, journalism, modelling and finance. The plan was for &quot;Marchioness&quot; to go downriver from the Embankment Pier near Charing Cross railway station to Tower Bridge, then back to Charing Cross to land some of the passengers. &quot;Marchioness&quot; would then travel down to Greenwich before returning again to Charing Cross, arriving back at 5:45Â am.

==20 August 1989==
===0:00Â am â 7:00Â am===

The night of 19â20 August 1989 was a clear one; it was three days after the full moon and there was good visibility. There was a negligible wind. It was a spring tide, recorded as one of the highest of the year and the river was at half-tide at the time of the collision; it was running upriver at a rate of three knots. There are several versions of the paths taken by the vessels in the approach to Southwark Bridge and beyond, and no agreement on the point when the two ships collided. Much of the evidence gathered in later investigations was inconsistent and any descriptions of the actions of the ships are based on average speeds and likely positions.

At 1:12Â am &quot;Bowbelle&quot; left her berth at the Nine Elms pier near Battersea Power Station and radioed her move by VHF radio to Thames Navigation Service (TNS), based in Woolwich. She reported passing Vauxhall Bridge at 1:20Â am and Waterloo Bridge at 1:35Â am. In accordance with the usual procedure, TNS radioed all river traffic at 1:15Â am and 1:45Â am, advising them of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s downstream passage. &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s average speed was about over the ground.

&quot;Marchioness&quot; was supposed to leave Embankment Pier at 1:00Â am, but was delayed until 1:25Â am. No count was made of the number of passengers, but the accepted number on board is either 130 or 131. Faldo was in the wheelhouse, where he stayed until the collision. Heading downriver, just before Blackfriars Bridge, &quot;Marchioness&quot; passed her sister pleasure cruiser &quot;Hurlingham&quot;âwhich was also hosting a disco that night, and was also heading in the same direction. &quot;Marchioness&quot;â³s average speed was about over the ground. She passed through the central arch of Blackfriars Bridge; at this point she was about in front of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;. At some point after Blackfriars Bridge, &quot;Bowbelle&quot; overtook &quot;Hurlingham&quot; and steered for the central arch of Southwark Bridge. &quot;Marchioness&quot; also went through the central arch, but probably towards the southern side.
When &quot;Bowbelle&quot; was within of &quot;Marchioness&quot;, the smaller vessel was affected by the forces of interactionâthe water being pushed ahead of the large ship. At about 1:46Â am, just after &quot;Marchioness&quot; passed under Southwark Bridge, she was hit twice by &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s bow. The first impact was from &quot;Marchioness&quot;â³s stern, which had the effect of turning the smaller vessel to port. The second impact was from the stern, and caused the pleasure boat to pivot round the bow of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, and turn it on its side, probably to an angle of 120Â°. The upper superstructure of &quot;Marchioness&quot; was ripped off by &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s anchor. The lower saloon was quickly flooded and the lights went out. The weight and momentum of &quot;Bowbelle&quot; pushed &quot;Marchioness&quot; underwater and she sank, stern first, within 30 seconds of being hit. McGowan had been thrown from the boat into the water, but climbed back on board to tie open the port side door, which led to the dance floor, to allow several people to escape. One eyewitness to the crash, Keith Fawkes-Underwood, who viewed the incident from the south bank of the Thames, reported:

The barge collided with the pleasure boat hitting it in about its centre then mounted it, pushing it under the water like a toy boat. Within a matter of about 20 seconds the pleasure boat had totally disappeared underneath the water.

Of the 130 people on board &quot;Marchioness&quot;, 79 survived and 51 died. The dead included de Vasconcellos and Faldo. No-one on &quot;Bowbelle&quot; was injured. &quot;Marchioness&quot; sank so quickly that most people were unable to locate or use the life rafts, buoys or jackets. Survival of those on &quot;Marchioness&quot; depended partly on their location within the vessel. There were 41 people known to have been on the forward deck and wheelhouse, of whom 9 died and 32 survived, a survival rate of 78%. Of the 13 people known to have been in the lower saloon, 9 died and 4 survived (a 31% survival rate). One of those from the lower saloon who survived was Iain Philpott, who said in his statement to the police:

I remember turning around to head towards the windows to escape the boat, the water started coming in the boat through the window, I knew at this point the boat was going to go down. Within a matter of seconds the general lights went out, everything was in darknessÂ ... I was then thrown forward by a wall of water, the whole boat filled with water instantlyÂ ... When I surfaced I was some distance away from the Marchioness which was partly submerged.

&quot;Hurlingham&quot; was between away from the collision, and those on board were in the best position to be eyewitnesses. George Williams, the vessel&#x27;s captain, put out a call on VHF radio to the Thames Division of the Metropolitan Police Service, based in Wapping: &quot;Woolwich Police, Wapping Police, Wapping Police, Emergency, pleasure boat is sunk, Cannon Street Railway Bridge, all emergency aid please&quot;. The call was also picked up by the TNS, who misheard the location as Battersea Bridge; Thames Division only heard part of the call, so TNS informed them that the police should be in attendance at Battersea Bridge.
After colliding with &quot;Marchioness&quot;, &quot;Bowbelle&quot; hit one of the piers of Cannon Street Bridge, and radioed TNS at 1:48Â am to correct the inaccurate reference to Battersea Bridge; at 1:49Â am Henderson reported to TNS:

I have to get underway now and proceed out through bridges. I believe I have struck a pleasure craft. It has sunk. I am getting clear of the bridges now. I was distracted by flashing lights from another pleasure craft. My vessel was proceeding outward bound just approaching Cannon Street bridge and, well, I just lost steerage, um and I don&#x27;t know after that, I can&#x27;t really say anything else sir. Over.

After the radio transmission, &quot;Bowbelle&quot; travelled downstream to Gallions Reach, where she dropped anchor. Her crew did not deploy the ship&#x27;s lifebuoys, flotation devices or lifeboat and she did not take part in the attempts to rescue survivors. All ships in the area were instructed to go to the area to assist with the rescue. &quot;Hurlingham&quot; was already on the scene, and the passengers and crew threw lifebuoys and buoyancy aids to those in the water. Many of those from &quot;Marchioness&quot; were swept into driftwood collection cages, and &quot;Hurlingham&quot; picked up several survivorsâthe passengers climbing out onto the cages to help people out of the water. The vessel then dropped all passengers and 28 survivors at the nearby Waterloo Police Pier (now Tower Lifeboat Station) before it took members of the emergency services back out to the collision site. Waterloo Police Pier was used as the landing point for all casualties and the first responders from the emergency services set up a treatment and processing point there. Police launches rescued more than half the survivors from the river; some reached the river bank themselves.

Less than half an hour after &quot;Marchioness&quot; was hit, a major incident was declared with an incident room at New Scotland Yard. The police&#x27;s body recovery team were also deployed, and the first body arrived at Wapping Police Stationâwhere the Thames Division were basedâat 6:50Â am. The station acted as a holding area for bodies before they were taken to the mortuary in Westminster.

===7:00Â am â 0:00Â am===
Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister, returned home early from her holiday in Austria to be briefed by Michael Portillo, the Minister of State for Transport. His senior in the department, the Secretary of State for Transport Cecil Parkinson, also returned home early in response. Portillo announced that an investigation would be made by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB), but that no decision had yet been made as to whether to hold a public inquiry. Within 24 hours of the collision, the decision was made that there would be no public inquiry, and that the MAIB investigation would be sufficient.

A Port of London (PLA) hydrographic surveyor located the wreckage of &quot;Marchioness&quot; and, during the late afternoon of 20 August, work began on lifting the vessel. The bodies of 24 party-goers were found on board, 12 of them in the lower saloon. The wreckage was moored against the north bank of the Thames.

While the lifting operation was progressing, police arrested and interviewed Henderson and Kenneth Noble, &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s second mate who was at the wheel for the collision. Both men were breathalysed; the police announced soon afterwards that alcohol was not a cause of the collision.

==Inquests and inquiries==

===1989 to 1997===
On the day following the collision Paul Knapman, the coroner for the City of Westminster, opened and adjourned the inquest into the deaths. In the days after the collision, bodies were still being found and recovered from the water. To help with the identification process, Knapman opted to use several methods, including dental records, identification of personal items and clothing descriptions from descriptions provided by the families, and fingerprints. As part of their approach, Knapman decided that:

With those bodies which were not recovered from the &quot;Marchioness&quot; and which would be likely to surface only when putrification and bloating meant that they would float, the following would apply:
During the post-mortem examinations, 25 pairs of hands were removed; no written records were kept of the removal. No guidelines were issued over which hands should be removed and no individual was given responsibility for making the decision. The majority were identified through other meansâvisual identification of the face, or through identification of clothing or personal items, and only four of the victims were identified through their fingerprints. Families of the victims later complained that they were not told in a timely fashion that bodies had been recovered, that some were denied access to view the bodies of their relatives, and were not told of the processes that would be usedâincluding that the hands would be removed. One family was shown the body of the wrong person, then given the right body, but without the hands; these were sent on later with apologies, and a request not to tell other parents about the need to remove them as this was a &#x27;one-off&#x27; mistake.

On 24 August &quot;Marchioness&quot; was taken from her mooring near Southwark Bridge, and towed downstream to Greenwich, where she was broken up.

The MAIB issued an interim report towards the end of August, with recommendations as to increasing safety on the Thames. These included a requirement that vessels over had to have a forward lookout in contact with the bridge by radio, and tighter controls on the passage of vessels along the upper Thames. Their investigation continued with a reconstruction of the events on the night of 16â17 September; &quot;Bowbelle&quot; took part, and a PLA launch was used as a stand-in for &quot;Marchioness&quot;. This was later criticised by Brian Toft, a disaster and risk-management expert commissioned by the Marchioness Action Group (MAG), as being unsatisfactory. Toft identified that there were several problems, including no second pleasure cruiser, no fare-paying passengers and no disco lights or music included in the re-enactment.

In October 1989 the companies behind &quot;Bowbelle&quot; and &quot;Marchioness&quot; agreed to pay up to Â£6Â million in compensation to the families of the victims, without either company admitting any liability for the crash. The sum offered was under a calderbank condition that the offer stood to be withdrawn if a judge awarded a lower amount. A week later a report was compiled for Allan Green, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), which recommended that criminal charges should not be brought against Henderson.

That December, Knapman met the DPP to discuss the progress of the inquests. Green agreed that the first part of the inquest should go aheadâdealing with the causes of deathâirrespective of the other investigations of the police and the possibility of later criminal charges. A second part of the inquestâestablishing the responsibility of the crash and making safety recommendationsâwould be discussed at a later stage. When Knapman re-opened the inquest on 23 April 1990, he was critical of the DPP for taking eight months to decide on whether to bring criminal charges against anyone, which meant that a full inquest could not take place in case it prejudiced any future trial. The inquest was, in effect, a series of what the legal scholar Hazel Hartley calls &quot;mini inquests&quot;, one each for each of the 51 bodies.

On 26 April the DPP stepped in to stop the inquest, stating that charges would now be brought against Henderson. Because of his decision to stop the inquest, the information on how the collision occurred, who was to blame or what could be done to ensure it could not be repeated, was not considered. Henderson was charged under the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 for failing to have an effective lookout on the vessel. The case against him opened on 4 April 1991 at the Old Bailey and ran to 14 April. The jury failed to reach a decision; the DPP decided that a retrial would be in the public interest. This took place between 17 and 31 July the same year; it again ended with a hung jury.

At the end of July 1991 Ivor , the husband of one of the victims, began a private prosecution for manslaughter against four directors of South Coast Shipping Company, the owners of &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, and corporate manslaughter against the South Coast Shipping Company. Two weeks later the Transport Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, took the decision to publish the MAIB Report, repeating that because an appropriate body had undertaken an investigation, there was no requirement to have a public inquiry. Families of the victims were angry with the move, pointing out that Rifkind had delayed publication of the report on the basis that publication could prejudice the case against Henderson, but that the publication could now jeopardise private prosecution. The DPP demanded that hand over the papers for the case, stating he would take it over, then drop it; refused to comply, stating that it was out of the remit of the DPP, and that it was for a magistrates&#x27; court to decide if the case was adequate. The DPP withdrew and allowed case to proceed. The case was dismissed after the magistrate stated that there was insufficient evidence.

The MAIB report considered that &quot;Marchioness&quot; had altered her course to port, which put her in line with &quot;Bowbelle&quot;â³s path. The report concluded that:

18.3Â  ... no one in either vessel was aware of the other&#x27;s presence until very shortly before the collision. No one on the bridge of BOWBELLE was aware of MARCHIONESS until the collision occurred.
18.4Â  The principal contributory factors were that:

The families of the victims criticised the MAIB report. They pointed out that the investigation had not directly interviewed anyone on &quot;Marchioness&quot; or &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, but relied on the police interviews; they stated that there were errors in methodology, approach and fact within the report. Toft provided a critique of the MAIB&#x27;s work and concluded that:

The inconsistencies, contradictions, confusions, conjecture, erroneous conclusions, missing and inappropriate recommendations as well as epistemological, ontological and methodological problems, created by the then current maritime safety cultureÂ ... raises serious doubts as to the objectivity of the investigation, the validity of the findings, the judgement of the Department of Transport in holding an inquiry of this type, and as a result whether or not all the appropriate lessons were uncovered during the MAIB&#x27;s inquiry into this tragedy.

The report was handed to Rifkind, who again declined to open a public inquiry, but commissioned a private oneâthe Hayes Report, published in July 1992âthat looked at health and safety on the Thames, rather than the sinking of &quot;Marchioness&quot;.

In 1992 the families of the victims became aware that the hands had been removed from many of the bodies. In March that year an account in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Cover up!&quot;, was published; when Knapman met the two journalists to deny the accusation of a cover-up, he advised them not to base reports on what Margaret Lockwood-Croft, the mother of one of the victims, said: he described her as &quot;unhinged&quot;. He also showed them photographs of the victims, without discussing the matter with the families. In July, Knapman informed the families that the inquestsâsuspended since April 1990 because of the case against Hendersonâwould not be recommenced. The families tried to apply for a judicial review on the basis that &quot;the use of the word &#x27;unhinged&#x27; and reference to a number of &#x27;mentally unwell&#x27; relatives betrayed an attitude of hostility, however unconscious, towardsÂ ... members of the Marchioness Action Group&quot;. Initially turned down by High Court, the Court of Appeal then found in favour of the group to allow an appeal. In June 1994 Knapman and his assistant were stood down and replaced by another coroner, John Burton. He was initially dismissive of the concerns of the MAG, accused their solicitor of trying to mislead the Court of Appeal and indicated that he was inclined not to grant any further inquests. Burton was told that another judicial review would be applied for if he refused to hold the inquests, and he subsequently announced that they would go ahead.

The resumed inquest took place in March and April 1995. When questioned about the MAIB report, Captain James de Coverleyâone of the report&#x27;s authorsâwithdrew the suggestion that &quot;Marchioness&quot; had steered to port in the last moments before the crash, saying it had never been his intention that the text could be understood that way. In summing up, Burton instructed the coroner&#x27;s jury that a verdict of unlawful killing could not be applied to anyone who had already been cleared by a court. The jury retired for four hours and returned a verdict of unlawful killing. Burton asked them &quot;Did you understand my Direction?&quot;, but the decision stood.

===1997 to 2001===
Following the 1997 election, which brought the Labour Party to power, the MAG petitioned John Prescott, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and Deputy Prime Minister, to open an inquest. In August 1999 he instructed Lord Justice Clarke to undertake a non-statutory inquiry into safety on the Thames. Clarke reported in February 2000, concluding:
I was asked to advise

My answer to that question is yes.
Prescott accepted the recommendation and the public inquest took place in October and November 2000, with Clarke chairing proceedings; the report was published in March 2001. Clarke concluded that &quot;The basic cause of the collision is clear. It was poor lookout on both vessels. Neither vessel saw the other in time to take action to avoid the collision.&quot; The underlying causes on why neither vessel saw the other were that Henderson did not ensure a proper lookout on &quot;Bowbelle&quot;; that Blayney the lookout was not equipped with suitable radio equipment to inform his captain; that Faldo had not set up a lookout system on &quot;Marchioness&quot;, nor did he keep a lookout aft himself. Focusing on Henderson, Clarke wrote &quot;We cannot stress too strongly how much we deprecate Captain Henderson&#x27;s conduct in drinking so much alcohol before returning to his vessel as master&quot;; Clarke added &quot;but we do not think that it is shown on the balance of probabilities that Captain Henderson would have acted differently if he had not consumed the alcohol or had the amount of sleep which he had&quot;. The captain was also criticised for his actions after the collision, when he did not broadcast a mayday call and did not deploy either the lifebuoys or life raft, in contravention of section 422 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Clarke also found that the owners and managers of the vessels held some blame. For &quot;Bowbelle&quot;, the owners &quot;must bear their share of responsibility for the collision for failing properly to instruct their masters and crews and for failing thereafter to monitor them&quot;; the owners of &quot;Marchioness&quot; gave no instructions about all-round lookouts; and failed to adequately instruct, supervise or monitor their boats&#x27; captains.

Clarke also allotted blame to the Department of Transport, who, he said, were &quot;well aware of the problems posed by the limited visibility from the steering positions on both types of vessel&quot; yet failed to deal with the problem. The PLA also failed to act in this regard, and should have issued instructions for the placement of lookouts on such vessels. Clarke found that because no individual&#x27;s actions could be ascertained as the single cause of the collision, a manslaughter charge would be bound to fail.

===Compensation===

English law provides no compensation for fatal accidents, other than for funeral expenses, unless financial dependency at the time of death can be proved. In most cases, the families of the &quot;Marchioness&quot; victims received little more than the cost of the funeral. Louise Christian, the human rights solicitor who acted for the families of the victims, wrote that &quot;When young unmarried people die in circumstances of gross negligence as here, death comes cheap and the boat owners and their insurance companies suffer little in the way of financial penalties&quot;.

Civil claims for compensation were brought on behalf of the victims&#x27; families; the amounts received ranged between Â£3,000 and Â£190,000. Eileen Dallaglio, the mother of Francesca Dallaglio, one of the victims, reported that she had been awarded Â£45,000. After the costs of having to go to the Court of Appeal to obtain damages, and the bills for the memorial and funeral service, she was left with Â£312.14. According to Irwin Mitchell, the solicitors who represented the families, the amounts were &quot;modest&quot; because many of those killed were young, without dependants and had no established careers. Under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, damages were only paid to certain categories of people, and were based on the economic loss to the victim. The saxophonist Josephine Wells, who had toured with Tears for Fears and the Communards, who was aboard the &quot;Marchioness&quot; and had a cousin die in the disaster, subsequently suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to work. She sued the owners of &quot;Bowbelle&quot; and &quot;Marchioness&quot; for loss of earnings and in 1997 she received Â£150,000 in damages.

==Aftermath==

After recommendations made in the Clarke report relating to the improvement of river safety, the government asked the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), the PLA and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) to work together to set up a dedicated search and rescue service for the Thames. In January 2001 the RNLI agreed to set up four lifeboat stationsâat Gravesend, Tower, Chiswick and Teddingtonâwhich were opened in January the following year.

Following the report, Prescott ordered the MCA to conduct a competency review into the actions and behaviour of Henderson. This took place in December 2001. The MCA picked up on something that had been raised during the Clarke inquiry: that Henderson had forged certificates and testimonials of his service from 1985â1986. They stated that they &quot;deplored&quot; the forgeries, which Henderson had used to gain his Master&#x27;s Licence. The MCA concluded that he should be allowed to keep his master&#x27;s certificate as he met all the service and medical fitness requirements; they stated that the agency &quot;accepted that events which occurred in 1986 have no practical relevance on his current fitness&quot;.
In 2001 the Royal Humane Society made nineteen bravery awards to people involved in rescuing the victims of the collision, many of whom were passengers on &quot;Hurlingham&quot;. Eight policemen on duty that night were given the Metropolitan Police Commissioner&#x27;s High Commendation.

Following the Clarke report and a subsequent review of emergency planning procedures, the government introduced the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 that provided a coherent framework and guidance for emergency planning and response. Clarke&#x27;s recommendations to examine the coroner system were a major factor in the overhaul of the system that resulted in the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.

The events surrounding the sinking of &quot;Marchioness&quot; have been examined or depicted on television several times, including a documentary on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; in December 1994, a drama-documentary in the BBC Two series &quot;Disaster&quot; in March 1999 and a 2009 documentary focusing on Jonathan Phang. A drama about the events surrounding the disaster was scheduled for broadcast on ITV in late 2007. Some of the victims&#x27; families requested that the programme should not be broadcast, although some thought it positive that it was going to be shown. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival that August, the former ITV Director of Drama Nick Elliot confirmed that the drama would not be shown &quot;in its present form&quot;; it has since been released on DVD.

In September 1989 a black granite memorial stone was uncovered in the nave of Southwark Cathedral, about from the site of the collision. The stone lists the names and ages of those who died. Memorial services have been held at the cathedral on anniversaries of the sinking.

&quot;Bowbelle&quot; was sold in 1992 to Sealsands Maritime, operating out of Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; she was renamed &quot;Billo&quot;. Four years later she was sold to Antonio Pereira &amp; Filhos of Funchal, Madeira, who named the vessel &quot;Bom Rei&quot;. She broke in two and sank off Madeira the same year with the loss of one crew member.

<doc id="1291830" wikidata="Q481874" url="?curid=1291830" title="Amy Jacques Garvey">
<text>Amy Euphemia Jacques Garvey (31 December 1895 â 25 July 1973) was a Jamaican-born journalist and activist. She was the second wife of Marcus Garvey. She was one of the pioneering female Black journalists and publishers of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Amy Euphemia Jacques was born on 31 December 1895 in Kingston, Jamaica. As the eldest child of George Samuel and Charlotte Henrietta, she was raised in a middle-class home. Yvette Taylor, in her account of the life of Amy Jacques Garvey, refers to her as being &quot;mulatta&quot;. Charlotte Henrietta was biracial, and George Samuel was a dark-skinned Black man. Taylor goes on to explain that Garvey&#x27;s mixed race heavily influenced her upbringing. At a young age, Garvey was taught to play the piano and took courses in music appreciation because music and music appreciation were believed to be considered the &quot;cultural finishing to a girl&#x27;s education&quot;. Garvey was a part of a small minority of Jamaican youth to attend high school. She attended Wolmer&#x27;s Schools.

Amy Jacques Garvey was urged by her father to read periodicals and newspapers to &quot;enhance&quot; her knowledge of the world. Upon graduating school and receiving some of the highest honors of the time, Garvey was recruited to work at a law firm. Her father initially said no, refusing to allow his daughter to work in an environment with males. George Samuel died that year, and the lawyer proceeding over his estate urged Charlotte Henrietta to allow Garvey to work in the clerical office so that she could control the estate. Charlotte agreed, and Garvey worked there for four years, where she ultimately gained knowledge of the legal system.

After four years of working for this company, Garvey migrated to the United States in 1917. She promised her employer and mother that she would return in three months if conditions in the U.S. were not suitable to her; however, Garvey did not return. Karen Adler, in her article chronicling Garvey&#x27;s life, argues that she did not return because she was enthralled by Garveyism.

Adler says that Amy attended a conference being held by Marcus Garvey and was moved by his words, soon afterwards assuming the role of his private secretary and working alongside him and the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). She also became involved with the publishing of the &quot;Negro World&quot; newspaper in Harlem from its inception in August 1918.

==Marriage and family==
On July 27, 1922, several months after his previous marriage was severed, Marcus and Amy were married for the second time in Baltimore.

Jacques was said to have been Amy Ashwood&#x27;s (Marcus Garvey&#x27;s previous wife) chief bridesmaid in her wedding to Garvey. Ashwood attempted to have the second marriage annulled and failed, leaving Amy Jacques as Garvey&#x27;s legitimate wife.

Garvey had two children in her marriage, Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. and Julius Winston Garvey born in 1930 and 1933 respectively.

== Leadership of UNIA ==

Amy Jacques Garvey was said to have been an excellent and impactful speaker, having toured all over the country. Amy Jacques Garvey had been on these tours with, and without her husband. After making a return from their western tour, Marcus was scheduled to speak in New York and Amy was not a part of the program.

Amy Jacques Garvey was not scheduled to speak, however, in response to the overwhelming outcry from the crowd, the plans for the speech were altered. Adler believes that Marcus Garvey failed to show any appreciation for his wife despite her growing fame in the public forum. Amy, however, did not pose an initial threat to Garvey. Given her strong beliefs in her position as his wife, and the structure of the organization, Amy took a back seat, as did other women in the UNIA . The grievances were made public at UNIA&#x27;s national convention in 1922. Sexism found a means to thrive even in spite of UNIA&#x27;s commitment to sexual equality. This being the case, women such as Amy Jacques Garvey, found a way to become invaluable to the organization.

While supporting her husband&#x27;s ambitions and the UNIA, Garvey began to focus on her own writings which made her known within the black community. In the UNIAâs official newspaper, &quot;The Negro World,&quot; sheâd have her own segment, âOur Women and What They Thinkâ, where she focused on the struggles that Black Women in America face. As a Black feminist, she emphasized the importance of Black Women being educated in different aspects of life; in order to have a brighter future for the next generation, to live in a society where Black women arenât seen as less than others. In writing about the newly discovered tomb of Tutankhamun in &quot;The Negro World,&quot; she argued against White, Western imperialistic views of history and showed the power and relevance of African history to African American communities.

In light of unforeseen circumstances, Garvey was forced to assume a lead role in UNIA after Marcus was convicted of mail fraud on 21 June 1922, less than a year after their marriage. It is at this time that Garvey assumed interim leadership of UNIA. In addition to speaking all over the country to raise money for Garvey&#x27;s defense fund, she edited and published volume 2 of the &quot;Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey&quot;, two volumes of his poetry, &quot;The Tragedy of White Injustice&quot; and &quot;Selections from the Poetic Meditations of Marcus Garvey&quot;. While doing this she worked tirelessly with lawyers to get her husband out of jail, and kept the UNIA moving forward by delivering speeches and occasionally meeting with the leaders of the group. Despite the effort that Garvey put into keeping Marcus&#x27;s dream alive, Marcus rarely showed appreciation towards her. Garvey never assumed official leadership of the organization because Marcus would not allow for it.

== Life after UNIA ==

After her husband was deported in 1927, Garvey went with him to Jamaica. They had two sons: Marcus Mosiah Garvey III (b. 1930) and Julius Winston Garvey (b. 1933). She remained with their children in Jamaica when Garvey moved to England in 1934.

After Garvey&#x27;s death in 1940, Jacques continued the struggle for black nationalism and African independence. In 1944 she wrote &quot;A Memorandum Correlative of Africa, West Indies and the Americas&quot;, which she used to convince the U.N. representatives to adopt an African Freedom Charter.

In November 1963, Garvey visited Nigeria as a guest of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who had been installed as the nation&#x27;s first President. She published her own book, &quot;Garvey and Garveyism&quot;, in 1963, as well as a booklet, &quot;Black Power in America: The Power of the Human Spirit&quot;, in 1968. She also assisted John Henrik Clarke in editing &quot;Marcus Garvey and the Vision of Africa&quot; (1974). Her final work was the &quot;Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey volume III&quot;, written in conjunction with E. U. Essien-Udom.

She was awarded the Musgrave Medal in 1971.

== Works ==

Garvey was an ardent writer on behalf of the UNIA movement as well as her husband, Marcus Garvey. Amy Jacques Garvey also had written books regarding Pan-African, civil rights, and feminist movements. In Garvey&#x27;s, &quot;Women as Leaders&quot;, she mentions the importance of Black women&#x27;s roles in society, and her writing serves as both a call to action and a celebration of women&#x27;s capabilities in leadership positions.


== Death ==
Garvey died aged 77 on 25 July 1973, in her native Kingston, Jamaica, and was interred in the churchyard of Saint Andrew&#x27;s Parish Church.

<text>Ewald Nowotny () (born June 28, 1944, in Vienna) is an Austrian economist and social democratic politician and former governor of Austria&#x27;s central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank. He was also a member of the European Central Bankâs governing council.

==Early life and education==
Nowotny graduated with a doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1966, took his habilitation at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in 1972 and was a full professor at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from 1981 until 2008.

==Political career==
Since 1974, Nowotny has held various functions in the Austrian Social Democratic Party. He was a member of the National Council, the more important chamber of the Austrian parliament, from 1978 to 1999.

==Career at financial institutions==
From 1999 to 2003, Nowotny was vice president of the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg. From the beginning of 2006 until mid-2008, he was CEO of BAWAG P.S.K. During his time in office, he managed BAWAGâs sale to US buyout-fund Cerberus Capital.

Since September 2008 Nowotny has served as Governor in Austria&#x27;s central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank and as a member of the ECB governing council. With the 2011 round of the Greek financial crisis, &quot;[s]ome analysts [saw] signs of growing tensions between European officials and the ratings agencies&quot; and Nowotny gave voice to the concern, saying &quot;that rating companies were making it more difficult to stabilize the Greek debt situation. &#x27;We have a somewhat strange situation. The banks themselves are ready, because they also have an interest in that, to stabilize Greece,&#x27; Nowotny said in Vienna, according to Dow Jones Newswires. &#x27;The ratings agencies are being in this European matter much stricter and more aggressive than in, for example, similar cases in South America.&#x27;â In summer 2011, Nowotny said it&#x27;s the ECB&#x27;s responsibility to decide whether or not to accept Greek debt as collateral in case rating agencies slap the country with a default rating. âAt the end of the day it has to be the decision of the ECB. The ECB should not be totally dependent on rating agencies,â Nowotny said in an interview with CNBC. âIt is our own responsibility, our own decision. We have proved this in the case of Ireland, Greece and Portugal, with regard to what kind of collateral we accept.â In May 2015, with a new round of the Greek government-debt crisis, Nowotny said while discussions &quot;may be refreshing by bringing in new ideas&quot; &quot;but at the end of the day, they must [end in] results&quot;, adding that discussions are &quot;not about playing games&quot;
and are &quot;more a political question than an economic question.&quot; He said at the same time that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t see the ECB&#x27;s role as creating a federalized financial government inside the euro zone.&quot;

He wants to regulate and have legal restraint at Bitcoin.

The village is located beside Dunaverty Bay, which at one end has a rocky promontory called &quot;Dunaverty Rock&quot;, where Dunaverty Castle was located. Historically the local inhabitants may be first mentioned by Ptolemy as the Epidii (horse people), whose main town may have been named later in the Ravenna Cosmography as Rauatonium. During the early medieval period Dunaverty became the location where Saint Columba first set foot in Scotland. Above the cemetery at Keil are two carved human footprints (Petrosomatoglyphs) similar to that seen at Dunadd, now called &quot;Columba&#x27;s Footprints&quot;. Here it is claimed Columba first preached on Scottish soil, after being banished from Ireland.

The Annals of Ulster report a siege in 712 by king Sealbach of Dalriada, confirming the importance of Dunaverty Rock as a fortified centre of power. Robert the Bruce sheltered at the castle, which changed hands many times in the later medieval period. During the Dunaverty Massacre of 1647 the Catholic MacDonalds were burned alive in their stronghold at Dunaverty Castle.

==Modern Southend==

John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll developed the village as &quot;Newton Argyll&quot; in the late 18th century.

Within Southend parish there are St Blaan&#x27;s church, Southend primary school, a GP&#x27;s surgery, Dunaverty Hall (the new village hall with a football pitch and children&#x27;s swing park), Dunaverty Golf Club&#x27;s well-maintained and affordable 18-hole links course, Machribeg caravan park and camp-site, the Argyll Arms Hotel, the listed Art Deco Keil Hotel, the historic ruin of Keil School, Keil caves, and the Muneroy shop and tea-room. The main employment sources are farming, forestry and tourism-related business.

The big attraction for tourists is the Mull of Kintyre, a high dramatic headland that is the closest point on Britain to Ireland. The Mull affords tremendous views and sunsets to the west including Ireland, Rathlin and Islay, and looks like a small piece of the Highlands. The road down from the top to the west-facing lighthouse is closed to most vehicles, but is walkable for the fit and determined. Several aircraft have crashed on the Mull, and there is a memorial to those lost in a Chinook helicopter crash in 1994 close to the road down to the lighthouse.

The beaches along the south coast of Kintyre are sandy, offering good walks in their own right or as part of the Kintyre Way, and good light for artists and photographers. The beaches are named for the farms (some of which offer caravans) including Gartvaigh, Brunerican, Penyseorach, Kilmashenachan, Macharioch and Polliwilline. The Antrim coast is 12 miles away and visible in clear weather. Sanda Island lies two miles south-east of Southend, and can be seen on wildlife boat trips from Campbeltown harbour in summer.

==Lifeboat station==

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) operated a lifeboat station at Southend from 1869 until 1930, the boathouse and slipway being at Dunaverty Bay. The lifeboat, station and a house for the coxswain were paid for by the Ker family of Auchinraith in memory of John Ronald Ker who drowned nearby in 1867. The lifeboat was first launched on 21 June 1869 and was managed by the same committee as Campbeltown Lifeboat Station which had opened in 1861. The boathouse was rebuilt in 1905 and a slipway built in 1905 to enable the boat to be launched more easily in bad weather.

During the 61 years of operation it was home to three different lifeboats:

<doc id="1291858" wikidata="Q288835" url="?curid=1291858" title="Criticism of the Federal Reserve">
<text>The Federal Reserve System, commonly known as &quot;the Fed,&quot; has faced various criticisms since its establishment in 1913. Critics have questioned its effectiveness in managing inflation, regulating the banking system, and stabilizing the economy. Notable critics include Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman and his fellow monetarist Anna Schwartz, who argued that the Fed&#x27;s policies exacerbated the Great Depression. More recently, former Congressman Ron Paul has advocated for the abolition of the Fed and a return to a gold standard.

Critics have also raised concerns about the Fed&#x27;s role in fractional reserve banking, its contribution to economic cycles, and its transparency. The Fed has been accused of causing economic downturns, including the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and of being influenced by private interests. Despite these criticisms, the Federal Reserve remains a central institution in the United States&#x27; financial system, with ongoing debates about its role, policies, and the need for reform.

==Creation==
An early version of the Federal Reserve Act was drafted in 1910 on Jekyll Island, Georgia, by Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich, chairman of the National Monetary Commission, and several Wall Street bankers. The final version, with provisions intended to improve public oversight and weaken the influence of the New York banking establishment, was drafted by Democratic Congressman Carter Glass of Virginia. The structure of the Fed was a compromise between the desire of the bankers for a central bank under their control and the desire of President Woodrow Wilson to create a decentralized structure under public control. The Federal Reserve Act was approved by Congress and signed by President Wilson in December 1913.

==Inflation policy==
In &quot;The Case Against the Fed&quot;, Murray Rothbard argued in 1994 that, although a supposed core function of the Federal Reserve is to maintain a low level of inflation, its policies (like those of other central banks) have actually aggravated inflation. This occurs when the Fed creates too much fiat money backed by nothing. He called the Fed policy of money creation &quot;legalized counterfeiting&quot; and favored a return to the gold standard. He wrote: 

The Federal Reserve has been criticized as not meeting its goals of greater stability and low inflation. This has led to a number of proposed changes including advocacy of different policy rules or dramatic restructuring of the system itself.

Milton Friedman concluded that governments do have a role in the monetary system, he was critical of the Federal Reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished. Friedman believed that the Federal Reserve System should ultimately be replaced with a computer program. He favored a system that would automatically buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money supply. This proposal has become known as Friedman&#x27;s k-percent rule.

Others have proposed NGDP targeting as an alternative rule to guide and improve central bank policy. Prominent supporters include Scott Sumner, David Beckworth, and Tyler Cowen.

==Congress==
Several members of Congress have criticized the Fed. Senator Robert Owen, whose name was on the Glass-Owen Federal Reserve Act, believed that the Fed was not performing as promised. He said: The Federal Reserve Board was created to control, regulate and stabilize credit in the interest of all people. . . . The Federal Reserve Board is the most gigantic financial power in all the world. Instead of using this great power as the Federal Reserve Act intended that it should, the board . . . delegated this power to the banks.
Representative Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency from 1920 to 1931, accused the Federal Reserve of deliberately causing the Great Depression. In several speeches made shortly after he lost the chairmanship of the committee, McFadden claimed that the Federal Reserve was run by Wall Street banks and their affiliated European banking houses. In one 1932 House speech (that has been criticized as bluster), he stated: 

Many members of Congress who have been involved in the House and Senate Banking and Currency Committees have been open critics of the Federal Reserve, including Chairmen Wright Patman, Henry Reuss, and Henry B. Gonzalez. Representative Ron Paul, Chairman of the Monetary Policy Subcommittee in 2011, is known as a staunch opponent of the Federal Reserve System. He routinely introduced bills to abolish the Federal Reserve System, three of which gained approval in the House but lost in the Senate.

Congressman Paul also introduced H.R. 459: Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2011, This act required an audit of the Federal Reserve Board and the twelve regional banks, with particular attention to the valuation of its securities. His son, Senator Rand Paul, has introduced similar legislation in subsequent sessions of Congress.

==Great Depression (1929)==

Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz stated that the Fed pursued an erroneously restrictive monetary policy, exacerbating the Great Depression. After the stock market crash in 1929, the Fed continued its contraction (decrease) of the money supply and refused to save banks that were struggling with bank runs.
This mistake, critics charge, allowed what might have been a relatively mild recession to explode into catastrophe. Friedman and Schwartz believed that the depression was &quot;a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces.&quot;
Before the establishment of the Federal Reserve, the banking system had dealt with periodic crises (such as in the Panic of 1907) by suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency. In 1907, the system nearly collapsed and there was an extraordinary intervention by an ad-hoc coalition assembled by J. P. Morgan. In the years 1910â1913, the bankers demanded a central bank to address this structural weakness. Friedman suggested that a similar intervention should have been followed during the banking panic at the end of 1930. This might have stopped the vicious circle of forced liquidation of assets at depressed prices, just as suspension of convertibility in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the liquidity crises at the time.

Essentially, in the monetarist view, the Great Depression was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz note that &quot;[f]rom the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third.&quot; The result was what Friedman calls &quot;The Great Contraction&quot;âa period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted money supply. The mechanism suggested by Friedman and Schwartz was that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. People thus hoarded money by consuming less. This, in turn, caused a contraction in employment and production, since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall. Friedman and Schwartz argued the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to plummet because of ineptitude and poor leadership.

Many have since agreed with this theory, including Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 2006 until 2014, who, in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz, said:
Friedman has said that ideally he would prefer to &quot;abolish the Federal Reserve and replace it with a computer.&quot; He preferred a system that would increase the money supply at some fixed rate, and he thought that &quot;leaving monetary and banking arrangements to the market would have produced a more satisfactory outcome than was actually achieved through government involvement&quot;.

In contrast to Friedman&#x27;s argument that the Fed did too little to ease after the crisis, Murray Rothbard argued that the crisis was caused by the Fed being too loose in the 1920s in the book &quot;America&#x27;s Great Depression&quot;.

==Global financial crisis (2007â08)==
Some economists, such as John B. Taylor, have asserted that the Fed was responsible, at least partially, for the United States housing bubble which occurred prior to the 2007 recession. They claim that the Fed kept interest rates too low following the 2001 recession. The housing bubble then led to the credit crunch. Then-Chairman Alan Greenspan disputes this interpretation. He points out that the Fed&#x27;s control over the long-term interest rates (to which critics refer) is only indirect. The Fed did raise the short-term interest rate over which it has control (i.e., the federal funds rate), but the long-term interest rate (which usually follows the former) did not increase.

The Federal Reserve&#x27;s role as a supervisor and regulator has been criticized as being ineffective. Former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd, then-chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, remarked about the Fed&#x27;s role in the 2007-2008 economic crisis, &quot;We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure.&quot;

==Fractional reserve banking==

The Federal Reserve does not actually control the money supply directly and has delegated this authority to banks. If a bank has a reserve requirement of 10% and they have 10 million dollars in bank deposits, they can create 100 million dollars to loan out to borrowers, or make other investments if it is an investment bank. It is essentially going on margin 10:1 without having to pay interest on the margin, because it is in effect money that they created themselves. According to this critique, this is the primary cause of credit cycles or business cycles, because money supply creation is not under any single entity&#x27;s control and is decentralized among many banks that are trying to maximize profits individually. The Federal Reserve indirectly controls this process by manipulating the Federal Funds Rate that sets the tone for interest rates on new debt throughout the economy, and intentionally puts the economy into a recession (hard landing) or slow the economy without a recession (soft landing) to tame inflation.

==Republican and Tea Party criticism==
During several recent elections, the Tea Party movement has made the Federal Reserve a major point of attack, which has been picked up by Republican candidates across the country. Former Congressman Ron Paul (R) of Texas and his son Senator Rand Paul (R) of Kentucky have long attacked the Fed, arguing that it is hurting the economy by devaluing the dollar. They argue that its monetary policies cause booms and busts when the Fed creates too much or too little fiat money. Ron Paul&#x27;s book &quot;End the Fed&quot; repeatedly points out that the Fed engages in money creation &quot;out of thin air.&quot; He argued that interest rates should be set by market forces, not by the Federal Reserve. Paul argues that the booms, bubbles and busts of the business cycle are caused by the Federal Reserve&#x27;s actions.

In the book, Paul argues that &quot;the government and its banking cartel have together stolen $0.95 of every dollar as they have pursued a relentlessly inflationary policy.&quot; David Andolfatto of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said the statement was &quot;just plain false&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; while noting that legitimate arguments can be made against the Federal Reserve. University of Oregon economist Mark Thoma described it as an &quot;absurd&quot; statement which data does not support.

Surveys of economists show overwhelming opposition to abolishing the Federal Reserve or undermining its independence. According to Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, &quot;mountains of empirical evidence support the proposition that greater central bank independence produces not only less inflation but superior macroeconomic performance, e.g., lower and less volatile inflation with no more volatility in output.&quot;

Ron Paul&#x27;s criticism has stemmed from the influence of the Austrian School of Economics. More specifically, economist Murray Rothbard was a vital figure in developing his views. Rothbard attempted to intertwine both political and economic arguments together in order to make a case to abolish the Federal Reserve. When first laying out his critiques, he writes &quot;The Federal Reserve System is accountable to no one; it has no budget; it is subject to no audit; and no Congressional committee knows of...its operations.&quot; This argument from Rothbard is outdated, however, as the Federal Reserve presently does report its balance sheet weekly as well as get audited by outside third parties.

Rothbard also heavily critiques the Federal Reserve being independent from politics despite the Federal Reserve being given both private and public qualities. The acknowledgment of the Federal Reserve being a part of government that exists outside of politics inevitably becomes a &quot;self-perpetuating oligarchy, accountable to no one.&quot; This ignores the fact that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is a federal agency, appointed by the president and Senate.

==Money supply should be controlled by Congress==

In the 1930s, American Catholic priest Charles Coughlin called on Congress to take back control of the money supply, as it is given authority under Article I, Section 8, in the Enumerated Powers, to coin money and regulate the value thereof. 

==Private ownership or control==
According to the Congressional Research Service:
According to the web site for the Federal Reserve System, the individual Federal Reserve Banks &quot;are the operating arms of the central banking system, and they combine both public and private elements in their makeup and organization.&quot; Each of the 12 Banks has a nine-member board of directors: three elected by the commercial banks in the Bank&#x27;s region, and six chosen â three each by the member banks and the Board of Governors â &quot;to represent the public with due consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers.&quot; These regional banks are in turn controlled by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, whose seven members are nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.

Member banks (&quot;about 38 percent of the nation&#x27;s more than 8,000 banks&quot;) are required to own capital stock in their regional banks. Until 2016, the regional banks paid a set 6% dividend on the member banks&#x27; paid-in capital stock (not the regional banks&#x27; profits) each year, returning the rest to the US Treasury Department. As of February 24, 2016, member banks with more than $10 billion in assets receive an annual dividend on their paid-in capital stock (Reserve Bank stock) of the lesser of 6% percent and the highest yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend. Member banks with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be paid a set 6% annual dividend. This change was implemented during the Obama administration in order &quot;to
implement the provisions of section 32203 of the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act)&quot;. The Fed has noted that this has created &quot;some confusion about &#x27;ownership&#x27;&quot;:

In his textbook, &quot;Monetary Policy and the Financial System&quot;, Paul M. Horvitz, the former Director of Research for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, stated,

In the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;, Michael D. Reagan wrote,

==Transparency issues==
One critique is that the Federal Open Market Committee, which is part of the Federal Reserve System, lacks transparency and is not sufficiently audited. A report by Bloomberg News asserts that the majority of Americans believes that the System should be held more accountable or that it should be abolished. Another critique is the contention that the public should have a right to know what goes on in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.

<text>Saturnalia is an extinct genus of basal sauropodomorph dinosaur known from the Late Triassic Santa Maria Formation of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. It contains one species, Saturnalia tupiniquim. It is one of the earliest known dinosaurs.

== Discovery and naming ==

Fossils of &quot;Saturnalia&quot; were first collected by the Museum of Science and Technology of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul in the austral summer of 1998. Some of the specimens were collected during Carnival. The specimens were found at a site called Wald Sanga or Sanga do Mato, one of several sites called &quot;sangas&quot; in the vicinity of Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, where red, fossil-bearing mudstone is exposed.
In 1999, Max Cardoso Langer, Fernando Abdala, Martha Richter, and Michael J. Benton described the new genus and species &quot;Saturnalia tupiniquim&quot; based on the three skeletons. The genus name is derived from the Roman festival of Saturnalia, in reference to the specimens&#x27; discovery during the festival of Carnival, and the species name, &quot;tupiniquim&quot;, is a word of Guarani origin colloquially used in Portuguese to refer to things of Brazilian origin.

Numerous studies have since been published on &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, making it one of the best-studied Carnian sauropodomorphs. 

===Fossil record===
&quot;Saturnalia tupiniquim&quot; is known from three well-preserved partial skeletons and disarticulated remains from at least three other individuals. The holotype, MCP 3844-PV is a partial skeleton including most of the presacral vertebrae and sacrum, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, the right humerus and part of the right ulna, the left femur, and most of the right hind limb. The paratypes are MCP 3845-PV, a partial skeleton including a partial skull, trunk vertebrae, pectoral girdle, right side of the pelvic girdle, right humerus, and most of the right hind limb, and MCP 3846-PV, a partial skeleton including trunk vertebrae, a tibia, and part of the foot. Referred material, cataloged as UFSM 16600, consists of the disarticulated remains of at least three other individuals, including a partial skull and remains of the pelvis and hindlimb.

The known fossils of &quot;Saturnalia&quot; all come from a single site in the Alemoa Member of the Santa Maria Formation, and are included in the &quot;Hyperodapedon&quot; Assemblage Zone. A maximum age for the &quot;Saturnalia&quot; type locality, determined by uraniumâlead dating, is 233.23 Â± 0.61 million years old. Because this age is derived from detrital zircons, it is a maximum age and the true age might be slightly less, making the rocks approximately equivalent in age to the base of the Ischigualasto Formation, which has been found to be approximately 231.5 million years old. &quot;Saturnalia&quot; is among the oldest known dinosaurs.

==Description==

&quot;Saturnalia&quot; was a small, bipedal animal that probably reached a length of and weighed between . The skull of &quot;Saturnalia&quot; was only about long, giving it a proportionally small head as in other sauropodomorphs. It was relatively short-snouted compared to contemporary sauropodomorphs. The neck of &quot;Saturnalia&quot; was moderately long, about 56â60% the length of the trunk, and was composed of nine or ten vertebrae. 

== Classification ==
The primitive nature of &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, combined with its mixture of sauropodomorph and theropod characteristics, has made it difficult to classify. Paleontologist Max Cardoso Langer and colleagues, in their 1999 description of the genus, assigned it to the Sauropodomorpha. However, in a 2003 paper, Langer noted that features of its skull and hand were more similar to the theropods, and that &quot;Saturnalia&quot; could at best be considered a member of the sauropodomorph &quot;stem-lineage&quot;, rather than a true member of that group.

JosÃ© Bonaparte and colleagues, in a 2007 study, found &quot;Saturnalia&quot; to be very similar to the primitive saurischian &quot;Guaibasaurus&quot;. Bonaparte placed the two in the same family, Guaibasauridae. Like Langer, Bonaparte found that these forms may have been primitive sauropodomorphs, or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods. Overall, Bonaparte found that both &quot;Saturnalia&quot; and &quot;Guaibasaurus&quot; were more theropod-like than prosauropod-like. However, all more recent cladistic analyses found it to be a very basal sauropodomorph, possibly guaibasaurid, as the family was found to nest in a basal position within Sauropodomorpha. The subfamily Saturnaliinae was established in 2010 by Martin Ezcurra to include &quot;Saturnalia&quot; and its close relative &quot;Chromogisaurus&quot;. 

==Paleobiology==

Like many other early dinosaurs, but unlike later sauropodomorphs, &quot;Saturnalia&quot; was most likely carnivorous or omnivorous, with a diet that included insects or small vertebrates. Its small head and long neck may have allowed it to move its head rapidly enough to catch small, elusive prey. 

==Paleoecology==

&quot;Saturnalia&quot; may have been prey to the contemporary herrerasaurid &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;. &quot;Buriolestes&quot;, a carnivorous sauropodomorph similar to &quot;Saturnalia&quot;, was contemporaneous with it, although the two have yet to be discovered at the exact same locality. &quot;Buriolestes&quot; was longer-snouted than &quot;Saturnalia&quot; and the two may demonstrate niche partitioning.

<text>Nano Reid (1 March 1900 â 17 November 1981) was an Irish painter who specialised in landscape, figure painting and portraits.

==Early life and education==

Nano Reid was born Anne Margaret Reid on 1 March 1900, in Drogheda, County Louth. She was the eldest of four children of Thomas Reid, publican, and Anne Reid (nÃ©e Downey). The family home was above their pub in Drogheda, with the family also owning a number of properties in the town and in Dublin. Reid attended school at the Siena Convent, where her talent for painting developed. Upon leaving school she initially enrolled to train as a nurse at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, but left after two months. Her parents were persuaded by their parish priest, Dr Segrave, to allow Nano Reid to attend the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin. Whilst there she studied under SeÃ¡n Keating, Harry Clarke, Patrick Tuohy and Leo Whelan. Nano Reid taught at her old school and a boys&#x27; school in Drogheda in 1923. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1925 with three illustrations of poems. Nano Reid exhibited with the RHA periodically until 1968, though never became an academic member.

In 1927, as was common with other Irish painters of the time, Nano Reid went to Paris. Whilst there, she attended to the AcadÃ©mie de la Grande ChaumiÃ¨re for a few months, but the experience doesn&#x27;t appear to have had an influence on her painting style. She then went to London to attend the Chelsea Polytechnic from 1929 to 1930, which she did not enjoy and after that remained in Ireland.

==Artistic career==

After returning to Ireland, Nano Reid began to exhibit landscape painting at the RHA. Like other painters of the period, such as Paul Henry, she travelled to the west of Ireland for painting inspiration with her early work showing the landscapes, local people and fisherman of the area. In 1934, she held a solo show at the Society of Dublin Painters at St Stephen&#x27;s Green. Her second solo show was in 1936 at the Daniel Egan Gallery in Dublin, the show consisted of 53 watercolours and 23 oil paintings. At the request of the Mayor of Drogheda , the collection was rehung in the town.

Nano Reid&#x27;s sister had taken over the family pub, to which she was a regular visitor while living primarily in Dublin. In Dublin she shared a house with her friend Patricia Hutchins. After WWII, Nano Reid moved to Fitzwilliam Square, sharing with others, including Pearse Hutchinson.

In 1950, Nano Reid and Norah McGuinness were selected to represent Ireland at the Venice Biennale of Art. This was the first time Irish artists participated in this international exhibition, which has been supported by the government of Ireland since then through a range of departments and agencies responsible for foreign affairs, arts and culture.

The Arts Council of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Chichester Street Gallery, Belfast was the venue for a collection of forty solo works in the summer of 1964. She had previously shown in Belfast as a guest of the Ulster Society of Women Artists and with the Irish Exhibition of Living Art.

<text>Thomas Mark Barrett (born December 8, 1953) is an American diplomat and politician who served as the United States ambassador to Luxembourg from 2022 to 2025. He previously served as the 44th mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 2004 until 2021.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was previously elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly (1984â1989), Wisconsin Senate (1989â1993) and U.S. House of Representatives (1993â2003). On April 6, 2004, Milwaukee elected Tom Barrett as its 40th mayor. He won reelection as mayor in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. After having unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Wisconsin in 2002, Barrett was the party&#x27;s nominee for governor in both 2010 and 2012, losing both elections to Scott Walker. When he left office as mayor, Barrett was the longest-serving current mayor of one of the 50 largest cities in the United States.

==Early life, education and early career==
Barrett is the oldest son of Gertrude Virginia (of German and English descent) and Thomas J. Barrett (of Irish descent). His father was a World War II veteran who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1944 for 30 missions over Germany as a navigator. His mother was a war widow when she met his father at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They married and moved to Milwaukee, where Barrett was born. He grew up on the city&#x27;s west side.

Barrett graduated from Marquette University High School; he went on to earn his Bachelor of Arts in economics from the University of WisconsinâMadison in 1976 and his Juris Doctor from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1980. He helped put himself through college and law school by working on the Harley-Davidson assembly line. After law school, Barrett served as a law clerk for Judge Robert W. Warren on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin from 1980 to 1982. He later entered into private practice and served as a bank examiner for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

===State Assembly and Senate===
Barrett made his first run for office at the age of 28 for the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1982, but was unsuccessful. He ran again in 1984, this time successfully; he served two terms before making a successful run for the Wisconsin Senate in a December 1989 special election. He continued to serve in the Wisconsin Senate until moving to higher office in 1993.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1992, after U.S. Representative Jim Moody announced his intention to run for the United States Senate, Barrett successfully ran to succeed him. Barrett was reelected four more times to represent Wisconsin&#x27;s 5th congressional district, which at the time included the northern half of the City of Milwaukee and some adjoining suburban municipalities. While in Congress, Barrett served on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, as well as the Government Reform Committee, Financial Services Committee, Ways and Means Committee and the House Administration Committee.

As a U.S. Representative, Barrett worked with his colleagues to secure aid for flood remediation projects in his district. He also worked to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act and frequently voiced his support of Milwaukee&#x27;s Midwest Express Airlines. Barrett sponsored 37 bills and co-sponsored 1345 bills between January 5, 1993, and October 10, 2002. He was a delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention from Wisconsin.

==Mayor of Milwaukee==
===Elections===
In 2004, Barrett ran successfully for mayor of Milwaukee, defeating incumbent Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt, who took office following the resignation of John Norquist. Barrett was reelected in 2008 with 79% of the vote, the largest percentage a mayoral candidate had received in 40 years. In 2012 he was subsequently reelected against challenger Edward McDonald with over 70% of the vote. In 2016, Barrett was reelected with 70% of the vote over conservative 8th district alderman Robert Donovan. In 2020, Barrett was reelected to a fifth term with over 62% of the vote against Lena Taylor.

===Development===
During Barrett&#x27;s tenure, the city has seen billions of dollars worth of new downtown developments. Barrett made great use of subsidies and tax incremental financing for developments. Barrett focused heavily on downtown development. In the later period of his mayoralty, the city saw its largest construction boom since the 1960s. The city&#x27;s downtown experienced a major construction boom that included several new skyscrapers, such as the Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.

In 2018, Barrett announced a plan to construct 10,000 units of affordable housing in the city. The plan included an expansion of the use of tax-incremental financing districts.

Barrett made an effort to revive struggling areas of the city by encouraging businesses to relocate to areas near lower-income neighborhoods.

===Economic matters===
On February 25, 2009, Barrett gave his State of the City Address. Where he praised the city&#x27;s past achievements and outlined his plan to increase green jobs, economic development and workforce training in the coming year. Barrett called on the citizens of Milwaukee to remain optimistic during the international economic downturn; &quot;I am fully confident that Milwaukee will withstand the current economic downturn,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;We will make smart investments, continue to build strong partnerships, provide training to our workforce and improve our public schools. We will emerge as a stronger and more competitive city.&quot; Barrett met with Vice President of the United States Joe Biden and testified before the United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment when he traveled to Washington, D.C., on March 18, 2009. Barrett attended a White House Recovery and Reinvestment Act Implementation Conference hosted by Biden. The conference addressed questions from state, county, and local government officials on how to effectively oversee the spending of Recovery Act funds.

===Environment===

Mayor Barrett has enacted his vision for a greener Milwaukee through the formation of Milwaukee&#x27;s Green Team the establishment of Milwaukee&#x27;s Office of Sustainability. The Office of Sustainability promotes cost-effective environmental sustainability practices that meet Milwaukee&#x27;s urgent environmental, economic and social needs while enhancing long-term economic growth. He is also one of the region&#x27;s greatest champions for the Great Lakes and previously served as Co-Chair of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, a binational organization of mayors and other local officials that works actively to advance the protection and restoration of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.

===Response to the COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Barrett took a number of actions. On March 23, 2020, citing concerns of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Barrett sent a letter to Governor Tony Evers, State Senate Majority Leader Scott L. Fitzgerald and Speaker of the State House Robin Vos, requesting that the April 7 elections (including the mayoral election, as well as Wisconsin&#x27;s presidential primaries and others races) be conducted using mail-in ballots only. Barrett lent his backing to a proposal authored by the Department of City Development under which business improvement districts would be allowed to spend money on assisting companies and property owners hurt by the pandemic without needing Common Council approval. Barrett lobbied the United States Army Corps of Engineers to establish a care facility at the Wisconsin State Fair Park.

===Other matters===
In April 2009, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle and Mayor Tom Barrett, joined by Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin Elizabeth Burmaster, announced a broad effort improve the Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS). The announcement followed the completion of a comprehensive independent review of the finances and non-instructional operations of MPS commissioned by the governor and mayor in October 2008.

In 2013, he was one of nine mayors who established July 15 as Social Media Giving Day, encouraging citizens to support charities via social media.

Barrett was an advocate for the construction of The Hop streetcar system.

Mayor Barrett was involved in Milwaukee&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Before he left the mayor&#x27;s office, Barrett started the city&#x27;s bid for the 2024 Republican National Convention. Milwaukee&#x27;s bid was successful.

==U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg==
On August 25, 2021, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate Barrett to serve as the United States Ambassador to Luxembourg. Hearings on his nomination were held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 2, 2021. The committee favorably reported the nomination on December 15, 2021. The United States Senate confirmed him on December 16, 2021, by voice vote. He was sworn in by Judge Lynn Adelman in Milwaukee on December 23, 2021, and arrived in Luxembourg on January 28, 2022. On February 10, 2022, he presented his credentials to the Grand Duke of Luxembourg at the Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City.

==Gubernatorial bids==
===2002===

Barrett decided to run for governor in 2002 when he decided to leave Washington D.C. after nearly a decade of service in the U.S. House of Representatives. He did so as a means spend more time in Milwaukee and Wisconsin with his family. Additionally, Wisconsin had lost a seat after the 2000 Census, and the new map resulted in Barrett&#x27;s district being merged with the 4th district on the other side of Milwaukee, represented by fellow Democrat Jerry Kleczka. While the merged district retained Kleczka&#x27;s district number, it was geographically and demographically more Barrett&#x27;s district. However, Barrett announced his candidacy for governor in 2001, effectively handing the merged 4th to Kleczka.

In a heated Democratic primary, Barrett came in a close second to then-Attorney General Jim Doyle, who went on to win the general election.

===2010===
In August 2009, Doyle announced his decision to not seek reelection to a third term in 2010, leading many to believe Barrett would run for governor. On August 25, a group named &quot;Wisconsin for Tom Barrett&quot; formed, encouraging Barrett to run. On October 26, a website, TomForGovernor.com, was launched after Barbara Lawton, the Lieutenant Governor, backed out. A story in &quot;The Politico&quot; reported that President Barack Obama&#x27;s political director Patrick Gaspard met with Barrett on November 4, 2009, amid speculation that the White House wanted him to run for Governor of Wisconsin.

Barrett ended months of speculation by officially announcing on November 15, 2009, that he would enter the race for governor. Barrett&#x27;s campaign raised more than $750,000 in its first seven weeks. In an e-mail thanking supporters, Barrett said his campaign had more than $1.5 million in the bank, a significant start given that he did not declare candidacy for the Democratic primary until November 15, 2009. Barrett ultimately lost the election to Scott Walker.


=== 2012 recall election ===

After the contentious collective bargaining dispute, Walker&#x27;s disapproval ratings varied between 50 and 51%, while his approval ratings varied between 47 and 49% in 2011. In a survey of 768 Wisconsin voters conducted between February 24â27, 2011, during the 2011 Wisconsin budget protests, a poll by Public Policy Polling found that 52% of respondents said they would vote for Barrett if the election had been held then, while 45% said they would vote for Walker. Wisconsin law made Walker eligible for recall beginning January 3, 2012, and the Wisconsin Democratic Party had called it a &quot;priority&quot; to remove him from office, although the signatures on the petitions were not verified.

Barrett ended months of speculation by officially announcing on March 30, 2012, that he would enter the race for governor. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which already supported another Democrat who had announced, had met with Barrett in late December 2011 and tried unsuccessfully to keep him from entering the race. On May 8, Barrett won the Democratic primary for the recall election.

A Marquette Law School Poll released on May 30 (mirroring other polling outlets) had Barrett trailing Walker 52% to 45% among likely voters. The results represent a six-point increase for Walker over Barrett since Marquette&#x27;s earlier poll in late April. The poll&#x27;s margin of error for likely voters was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. Odysseas, a contributor to the progressive blog Daily Kos, had questioned if the Marquette University Law school poll oversampled &quot;right wingers.&quot; For example, a poll by Public Policy Polling conducted May 11â13 gave Republicans a 7% edge over Democrats in terms of likely voters, unlikely given Wisconsin voter registration patterns. However, in retrospect the Marquette poll accurately reflected the Wisconsin electorate&#x27;s vote. However, the same poll showed President Obama holding a lead over Mitt Romney 51â43. On May 21, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel endorsed Scott Walker over Barrett arguing &quot;[there is] no reason to remove Walker from office.&quot; The Journal-Sentinel had previously endorsed Walker over Barrett in 2010. Walker defeated Barrett in the June 5 recall election by garnering 53.2%-46.3%, a similar margin to the 2010 election. Walker thus became the first governor in US history to survive a recall election.




==Personal life==
Barrett and his wife still live in Milwaukee&#x27;s Washington Heights neighborhood, blocks away from his childhood home, where they raised their four, now adult, children Tommy, Annie, Erin and Kate, who all attended Milwaukee German Immersion School.

===2009 Wisconsin State Fair attack===
Barrett was the subject of national news headlines when he was attacked outside the Wisconsin State Fair on August 15, 2009, by a man wielding a pipe. Barrett and some family members were leaving the fair when he responded to a woman&#x27;s cries for help. They encountered a man and a woman in a heated confrontation. While the mayor called the police, the man, 20-year-old Anthony J. Peters, attacked him with a pipe. Barrett was hospitalized after the incident and again later for reconstructive surgery for his hand. Governor Jim Doyle visited Barrett in the hospital the next morning and said he &quot;found him to be in good spirits and looking good considering what happened... The mayor&#x27;s heroic actions clearly saved a woman and others from harm&quot;, Doyle said in a statement. Peters was arrested the next day. Both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden telephoned Barrett in the hospital to inquire as to his condition; Obama told Barrett that he went above the call of duty and said he was proud of Barrett&#x27;s actions. Barrett&#x27;s injuries included broken teeth, a permanently damaged hand, as well as blows to the head where he was struck with the pipe. Peters pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison and a further 10 years of supervision.

<doc id="1291882" wikidata="Q146107" url="?curid=1291882" title="Atenism">
<text>Atenism, also known as the Aten religion, the Amarna religion, the Amarna revolution, and the Amarna heresy, was a religion in ancient Egypt. It was founded by Akhenaten, a pharaoh who ruled the New Kingdom under the Eighteenth Dynasty. The religion is described as monotheistic or monolatristic, although some Egyptologists argue that it was actually henotheistic. Atenism was centered on the cult of Aten, a god depicted as the disc of the Sun. Aten was originally an aspect of Ra, Egypt&#x27;s traditional solar deity, though he was later asserted by Akhenaten as being the superior of all deities.

In the 14th century BC, Atenism was Egypt&#x27;s state religion for around 20 years, and Akhenaten met the worship of other gods with persecution; he closed many traditional temples, instead commissioning the construction of Atenist temples, and also suppressed religious traditionalists. However, subsequent pharaohs toppled the movement in the aftermath of Akhenaten&#x27;s death, thereby restoring Egyptian civilization&#x27;s traditional polytheistic religion. Large-scale efforts were then undertaken to remove from Egypt and Egyptian records any presence or mention of Akhenaten, Atenist temples, and assertions of a uniquely supreme god.

==History of Aten before Akhenaten==
The word &quot;Aten&quot; (), meaning &quot;circle&quot;, &quot;disc&quot;, and later &quot;sun disc&quot;, is first found in the 24th century BC Abusir Papyri, discovered in the mortuary temple of the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai. Aten, the god of Atenism, first appears as a god in texts dating to the Twelfth Dynasty, in the &quot;Story of Sinuhe&quot;. During the Middle Kingdom, Aten &quot;as the sun disk...was merely one aspect of the sun god Re.&quot; It was a relatively obscure sun god; without the Atenist period, it would barely have figured in Egyptian history. Although there are indications that it was becoming slightly more important during the eighteenth dynasty, notably Amenhotep III&#x27;s naming of his royal barge as &quot;Spirit of the Aten&quot;, it was Amenhotep IV who introduced the Atenist revolution in a series of steps culminating in the official installment of the Aten as Egypt&#x27;s sole god. Although each line of kings prior to the reign of Akhenaten had previously adopted one deity as the royal patron and supreme state god, there had never been an attempt to exclude other deities, and the multitude of gods had always been tolerated and worshipped. During the reign of Thutmose IV, it was identified as a distinct solar god, and his son Amenhotep III established and promoted a separate cult for the Aten. However, there is no evidence that Amenhotep III neglected the other gods or attempted to promote the Aten as an exclusive deity.

==Atenist Egypt==
Amenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in the fifth year of his reign (1348/1346 BC), raising Aten to the status of supreme god, initially permitting continued worship of the traditional gods. Later, during the reign of Akhenaten, he forbade the worship of other gods, a radical departure from the centuries of Egyptian religious practice. To emphasise the change, Aten&#x27;s name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. The religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh&#x27;s divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh&#x27;s reign, it possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III. Some Egyptologists think that he had a coregency with Amenhotep IV of 2â12 years.
The fifth year is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV&#x27;s construction of a new capital, Akhetaten (&quot;Horizon of the Aten&quot;), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. Then, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (&quot;Spirit of the Aten&quot;) as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In the seventh year of his reign (1346/1344 BC), the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten, but construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres, he was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too. Taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten&#x27;s symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.

In the ninth year of his reign (1344/1342 BC), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the &quot;Great Hymn to the Aten&quot;: &quot;O sole God beside whom there is none&quot;. Aten&#x27;s name is also written differently after the ninth year of the Pharaoh&#x27;s rule to emphasise the radicalism of the new regime. Aten, instead of being written with the symbol of a rayed solar disc, now became spelled phonetically.

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but some scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry or henotheism rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods. He simply refrained from worshipping any but Aten. These reforms were later reversed by his successor Pharaoh Tutankhamen.

Some historians argue that only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.

==Contrast with traditional Egyptian religion==

Akhenaten carried out a radical program of religious reform. For about twenty years, he largely supplanted the age-old beliefs and practices of the Egyptian state religion, and deposed its religious hierarchy, headed by the powerful priesthood of Amun at Thebes. For fifteen centuries, the Egyptians had worshiped an extended family of gods and goddesses, each of which had its own elaborate system of priests, temples, shrines and rituals. A key feature of the cults was the veneration of images and statues of the gods, which were worshipped in the dark confines of the temples.

The pinnacle of the religious hierarchy was the Pharaoh, both king and living god. The administration of the Egyptian kingdom was thus inextricably bound up with and largely controlled by the power and influence of the priests and scribes. Akhenaten&#x27;s reforms cut away both the philosophical and economic bases of priestly power, abolishing the cults of all other deities and, with them, the large and lucrative industry of sacrifices and tributes that the priests controlled.

At the same time, he strengthened the role of the Pharaoh. Dominic Montserrat, analyzing the various versions of the hymns to the Aten, argues that all versions of the hymns focus on the king; he suggests that the real innovation is to redefine the relationship of god and king in a way that benefited Akhenaten, quoting a statement of Egyptologist John Baines: &quot;Amarna religion was a religion of god and king, or even of king first and then god&quot;.

Initially, Akhenaten presented Aten to the Egyptian people as a variant of the familiar supreme deity Amun-Ra (itself the result of an earlier rise to prominence of the cult of Amun, resulting in Amun becoming merged with the sun god Ra), in an attempt to put his ideas in a familiar religious context. &#x27;Aten&#x27; is the name given to the solar disc, and the god&#x27;s full title on boundary steles of the new capital was &quot;Ra-Horus, who rejoices in the horizon in his name of the light which is in the sun disc&quot;.

However, in the ninth year of his reign, Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion by declaring Aten not merely the supreme god but the only god, and Akhenaten as the son of Aten was the only intermediary between the Aten and his people. He ordered the defacing of Amun&#x27;s temples throughout Egypt. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc in which the rays, commonly depicted as ending in hands, appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Later still, even this was done away with.

==Amarna art==
Styles of art that flourished during the brief period are markedly different from other Egyptian art. They bear a variety of affectations, from elongated heads to protruding stomachs, exaggerated ugliness, and the beauty of Nefertiti. Significantly, for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten&#x27;s family was depicted in a decidedly naturalistic manner. It is clearly shown displaying affection.

Images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti usually depict the Aten prominently above that pair, with the hands of the Aten closest to each offering Ankhs. Unusually for New Kingdom art, the Pharaoh and his wife are depicted as approximately equal in size, with Nefertiti&#x27;s image used to decorate the lesser Aten temple at Amarna. That may suggest that she also had a prominent official role in Aten worship.

Artistic representations of Akhenaten usually give him an unusual appearance, with slender limbs, a protruding belly and wide hips. Other leading figures of the Amarna period, both royal and otherwise, are also shown with some of these features, suggesting a possible religious connotation, especially as some sources suggest that private representations of Akhenaten, as opposed to official art, show him as quite normal. It is also suggested by Brier that the family suffered from Marfan&#x27;s syndrome, which is known to cause elongated features, which may explain Akhenaten&#x27;s appearance.

==Decline==
The collapse of Atenism began during Akhenaten&#x27;s late reign when a major plague spread across the ancient Near East. This pandemic appears to have claimed the lives of numerous royal family members and high-ranking officials, possibly contributing to the decline of Akhenaten&#x27;s government. The events of this period are not well known due to the paucity and fragmentary nature of surviving sources. According to the most likely scenario, the widespread deaths due to the plague caused Akhenaten to appoint two co-regents in quick succession: Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten. The origin of both is not attested, though it has been speculated that Smenkhkare was a younger brother of Akhenaten, whereas Neferneferuaten was in fact, Queen Nefertiti. Smenkhkare died after a short reign, eventually leaving Neferneferuaten as the acting regent of Egypt.

Though Akhenaten&#x27;s last years saw possibly the most aggressive repression of Amun and, less likely, other gods, his death quickly resulted in the resurgence of the old cults. Neferneferuaten appears to have attempted to reach some accommodation with the Amun priesthood, while still preserving a less exclusive form of Atenism. After a few years, however, Neferneferuaten disappeared, and her successor Tutankhaten (with Akhenaten&#x27;s old vizier, Ay, as regent) changed his name to Tutankhamun in the third year of his reign (c. 1330 BC), restored power to the Amun priesthood, and moved the capital away from Akhetaten, perhaps to Memphis, or, less likely, Thebes.

The following two decades saw Atenism&#x27;s terminal decline. Most of the temples that Akhenaten had built from talatat blocks, including the temple at Thebes, were disassembled, reused as a source of building materials and decorations for other temples, and inscriptions to Aten were defaced. Though Akhetaten was not fully abandoned, and the local Aten temple continued to function, most residents left over time. After Ay&#x27;s short rule as pharaoh in his own right following Tutankhamun&#x27;s death, his general, Horemheb, a non-royal, came to power. He ordered a purge of the Amarna Period rulers, removing Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, Neferneferuaten, Tutankhamun, and Ay from the official lists of Pharaohs, and destroying their monuments, including most remaining Aten temples. Nevertheless, the Aten temple in Akhetaten was still in use during Horemheb&#x27;s first years, suggesting that the purge was not universal, perhaps leaving some small pockets of Atenism in Egypt.

Though this marked the &quot;de facto&quot; end of Atenism, the revolutionary cult left some lasting impact on ancient Egyptian religion. For example, some changes in funerary rites during the Amarna Period remained in place under Horemheb and his successors.

==Link to Abrahamic monotheism==

Because of the monolatristic or monotheistic character of Atenism, a link to Judaism (or other monotheistic religions) has been suggested by various writers. For example, psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud assumed Akhenaten to be the pioneer of monotheistic religion and Moses as Akhenaten&#x27;s follower in his book &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot;.

The modern Druze regard their religion as being descended from and influenced by older monotheistic and mystic movements, including Atenism. In particular, they attribute the Tawhid&#x27;s first public declaration to Akhenaten.

==In popular culture==
* British writer Agatha Christie wrote the play &quot;Akhnaton&quot; in 1937. The story involves Pharaoh Akhenaten, his wife Nefertiti, and his successor Tutankhnaton (later to take the name, Tutankhamun). Christie was assisted in her research by Egyptologist Stephen Glanville. 
* American composer Philip Glass composed a grand opera about Akhenaten which sets texts from the Amarna letters and Hymn to the Aten.
* Finnish author Mika Waltari used the idea of Aten and Atenism in his historical novel &quot;The Egyptian&quot;. &quot;The Egyptian (film)&quot; is a 1954 movie based on Waltari&#x27;s novel depicting a fictionalized account of Atenism and Akhenaten.
* In the video game &quot;The Secret World&quot;, the Aten is a malevolent supernatural force that wants to destroy Egypt, and Akhenaten is a victim of its mind control.
* American author Ishmael Reed develops a blend of real and imagined history involving an ancient monotheistic &quot;Atonist&quot; order throughout his 1972 novel &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;.
* In the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;; &#x27;The Curse of the Pharaohs&#x27; features the realm of Aten, with a solar disc styled on the traditional depiction.
* Keyboardist for The Doors, Ray Manzarek, practiced Atenism for most of his adult life.

<text>Malatya (; ; Syriac Ü¡Ü ÜÜÜÜ¢Ü MalÄ«á¹­Ä«nÃ¡; ; Ancient Greek: ÎÎµÎ»Î¹ÏÎ·Î½Î®) is a large city in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey and the capital of Malatya Province. The city has been a human settlement for thousands of years. 

In Hittite, &quot;melid&quot; or &quot;milit&quot; means &quot;honey&quot;, offering a possible etymology for the name, which was mentioned in the contemporary sources of the time under several variations (e.g., Hittite: &quot;Malidiya&quot; and possibly also &quot;Midduwa&quot;; Akkadian: Meliddu; UrarÌ©tian: Meliá¹­eia).

Strabo says that the city was known &quot;to the ancients&quot; as Melitene (Ancient Greek &quot;ÎÎµÎ»Î¹ÏÎ·Î½Î®&quot;), a name adopted by the Romans following Roman expansion into the east. According to Strabo, the inhabitants of Melitene shared with the nearby Cappadocians and Cataonians the same language and culture.

The site of ancient Melitene lies a few kilometres from the modern city in what is now the village of Arslantepe and near the district center of Battalgazi (Byzantine to Ottoman Empire). Present-day Battalgazi was the location of the city of Malatya until the 19th century, when a gradual move of the city to the present third location began. Battalgazi&#x27;s official name was Eskimalatya (&quot;Old Malatya&quot;); until recently, it was a name used locally. In Turkey the city is renowned for its apricots, as up to 80% of the Turkish apricot production is provided by Malatya, giving Malatya the name &quot;kayÄ±sÄ± diyarÄ±&quot; (&quot;apricot realm&quot;).

In February 2023, the city suffered huge damage as a result of the TurkeyâSyria earthquake.

== History ==

=== Arslantepe ===


Arslantepe has been inhabited since the development of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent, nearly 6,000 years ago. From the Bronze Age, the site became an administrative center of a larger region in the kingdom of Isuwa. The city was heavily fortified. The Hittites conquered the city in the fourteenth century B.C. In the Hittite language, &quot;melid&quot; or &quot;milit&quot; means &quot;honey.&quot; The name was mentioned in the contemporary sources under several variations (e.g., Hittite: &quot;Malidiya&quot; and possibly also &quot;Midduwa&quot;; Akkadian: Meliddu; Urartian: Meliá¹­eia).

After the end of the Hittite Empire, the city became the center of the Neo-Hittite state of Kammanu. The city continued old Hittite traditions and styles. Researchers have discovered a palace inside the city walls with statues and reliefs. A palace was erected with monumental stone sculptures of lions and the ruler. Kammanu was a vassal state of Urartu between 804 and 743.

According to Igor Diakonoff and John Greppin, there was likely an Armenian presence in Melid by 1200 BCE.

The Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I (1115â1077 B.C.) forced the kingdom of Malidiya to pay tribute to Assyria. The Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II (722â705) sacked the city in 712 BC. At the same time, the Cimmerians and Scythians invaded Anatolia and the city declined. Some occupation continued on the site into the Hellenistic and Roman periodsâa smithy with four ovens has been excavated from the Roman period. There was a long gap in occupation between the mid-7th century and renewed use of the site in the late 12th or early 13th century.

Archeologists first began to excavate the site of Arslantepe in the 1930s, led by French archaeologist Louis Delaporte. Since 1961 an Italian team of archaeologists, led by Marcella Frangipane in the early 21st century, has been working at the site.

From the 6th century BC, Melid was ruled by the Armenian Orontid Dynasty, who were subjects of the Achaemenid Empire. After periods of Achaemenid and Macedonian rule, Melid (Malatya) was part of the Kingdom of Lesser Armenia.

=== Melitene during the Roman Empire ===

Diodorus Siculus wrote that Ptolemaeus of Commagene attacked and captured Melitene from the Kingdom of Cappadocia, but couldn&#x27;t keep it for long since Ariarathes V of Cappadocia marched against him with a strong army, and Ptolemaeus withdrew.
The Kingdom of Cappadocia, ruled by the House of Ariobarzanes (95â36 BC), became a Roman client in 63 BC. After the Kingdom&#x27;s annexation by the Roman Empire in 17 AD, the settlement was re-established as Melitene in 72 AD on a different site, as the base camp of Legio XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; (which continued to be based there until at least the early 5th century according to Notitia Dignitatum). The legionary base of Melitene controlled access to southern Armenia and the upper Tigris. It was the end point of the important highway running east from Caesarea (modern Kayseri). The camp attracted a civilian population and was probably granted city status by Trajan in the early 2nd century AD, with the rank of Municipium. It is known for being a prolific source of imperial coins minted from the 3rd to the early 5th centuries.

Procopius wrote admiringly of the temples, agoras and theatres of Melitene, but no evidence of them now remains. It was a major center in the province of Armenia Minor ( &quot;Pokr Hayk&quot;,) created by Diocletian from territory separated from the province of Cappadocia. In 392 A.D., emperor Theodosius I divided Armenia Minor into two new provinces: First Armenia, with its capital at Sebasteia (modern Sivas); and Second Armenia, with its capital at Melitene.

=== Middle Ages and Ottoman rule ===

During the reign of the Emperor Justinian I (527â565), administrative reforms were carried out in this region: The province of Second Armenia was renamed Third Armenia (&quot;Armenia Tertia&quot;), with its territory unchanged and its capital still at Melitene. Melitene&#x27;s city walls were constructed in the 6th century by the emperors Anastasius and Justinian. Those that still stand mostly date from the Arab period, perhaps of the 8th century, though retaining the layout of and some remnants from earlier building phases. The city was sacked by the Sassanids in 575, but it recovered and was made in 591 the capital of Armenia Prima by emperor Maurice. The town contained many shrines to martyrs, including that of the widely venerated local saint Polyeuctus. 

The city was captured by the Rashidun forces under Iyad ibn Ghanm, but the Byzantines quickly retook it until Mu&#x27;awiya I established a garrison in the town. The Arab colony was abandoned at some point during the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan until Hisham restored it, though it was destroyed by emperor Constantine V. The Abbasid al-Mansur then established it as a substantial outpost from which raids deep into the Byzantine Empire were conducted. Throughout the Dark Ages, the area between Melitene and Caeserea became a no-man&#x27;s land of independent lords and villages. In the 9th century, under its semi-independent emir Umar al-Aqta, Malatya rose to become a major opponent of the Byzantine Empire until Umar was defeated and killed at the Battle of Lalakaon in 863. The Byzantines attacked the city many times, but did not finally take it until the campaigns of John Kourkouas in 927â934. After successively accepting and renouncing vassal status, the city was finally taken in May 934, its Muslim inhabitants driven out or forced to convert, and replaced by Greek and Armenian settlers.

The West Syrian diocese of Melitene has been established since the sixth century and was as well surrounded by other bishoprics belonging to nearby towns. In the tenth century the Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas convinced the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch to move the head of the patriarchate into the region of Melitene. The city was attacked and devastated by the Seljuks in 1058. Around 1061/62 the city was refortified by Constantine X Doukas and enclosed an area of 35 ha, which means that it was possibly home to 10-12,000 people and had possibly a territorial population of an additional 80,000.
In the period that followed the Turkish advance into the Byzantine Empire after the defeat at the Battle of Manzikert, Gabriel of Melitene, a Greek Orthodox Armenian who had risen from the ranks of the Byzantine army, governed the city. From 1086 to 1100 he preserved his independence with the aid of the Beylik of the Danishmends. After 1100, he sought to gain the favour of the commanders of the First Crusade, especially Bohemond I of Antioch and Baldwin of Boulogne.

The Danishmends took over Malatya one year later in 1101 (see Battle of Melitene). The Danishmends then fought repeatedly with the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate about the possession of the city and were able to hold it until 1152, though the Seljuks did not gain full control until 1177. Under Danishmend and Seljuk rule, Malatya became a centre of knowledge as many Persian and Arabic scholars took residence in the city. The Seljuk Sultanate also undertook an extensive development of the city. After being ruled by the Ilkhanids for around 50 years at the end of the 13th century, the Muslim population of the city invited the Mamluk Sultanate to Malatya in 1315. On 28 April 1315, the Mamluk army entered the city; this was followed by the looting of the city by the army. The Eretna Dynasty gained sovereignty over the city for some time, but from 1338 onwards the Mamluks secured its control. However, for the latter part of the 14th century, the control of the city fluctuated between the Mamluks and the Dulkadirids. The city was captured by the Ottoman army led by Yavuz Sultan Selim on 28 July 1516 and remained under Ottoman rule until the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. Under the Ottomans, the city lost the quality of being on the frontiers, as well as the allure it held in the Middle Ages. It was plagued between the 16th and 18th centuries by successive rebellions.

=== Modern period ===


The current city of Malatya was founded in 1838, with the old site of Militene now designated as Old Malatya. The reason behind the displacement of the city center was that the Ottoman army settled and stayed, probably by seizing from its settlers, in the previous city center, in the winter of 1838â39, before taking the road for Battle of Nezib in 1849. Because of this, citizens of the Malatya established the new city based on a near town called Aspuzu. The city saw rapid expansion in the 19th century, and by the end of the century it had around 5000 households, 50 mosques, six madrasas, nine inns and five Turkish baths. Ottoman sources also recorded ten churches. In 1889 and 1890, Malatya was struck by two large fires that destroyed thousands of shops. The city was then hit by the 1893 Malatya earthquake, which killed 1300, destroying 1200 houses and four mosques. A cholera outbreak that subsequently took place in 1893 killed 896 people. The destroyed buildings were rebuilt in 1894.
Malatya was the scene of anti-Armenian violence during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the Hamidian massacres of 1895â1896, 7,500 Armenian civilians were massacred and Armenian villages in the rural countryside of Malatya were destroyed. In the aftermath, a Red Cross team sent to Malatya and led by Julian B. Hubbell concluded that 1,500 Armenian houses had been pillaged and 375 burned to the ground.
According to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Malatya city was inhabited by 30,000 people with a clear ethnic Turkish majority, and an Armenian population of 3,000, of whom 800 were Catholics. Of the five churches in the city, three belonged to the Armenians. In the spring of 1915, the vast majority of the Armenians of the town were rounded up by Ottoman authorities and deported on death marches as part of the Armenian genocide. According to reports of the governor of the Malatya district, of the 6,935 registered Armenians in Malatya, 197 were left in the town as artisans. In the early Republican era, Malatya became the centre of Malatya Province and enjoyed a substantial growth in terms of population as well as covered area. This development was further accelerated by the construction of the Adana-FevzipaÅa-Malatya railroad in 1931, and a few years later in 1937, by the construction of the Sivas-Malatya railroad.

Until recently the city was home to departments of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, Turkish Hearths, and Turkish Red Crescent. In 2014 Malatya became a metropolitan municipality in Turkey, alongside 12 other cities, by a Turkish governmental law that was passed in 2012. Following the 2014 Turkish local elections the new municipality officially took office. Today the city is generally considered to be a notable trade and industrial hub, as well as a cultural centre point thanks to the Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ University that was established on 28 January 1975.

== Demographics ==
According to German geographers Georg Hassel and Adam Christian Gaspari, Malatya was composed of 1,200 to 1,500 houses in the early 19th century, inhabited by Turks, Armenians, and Greeks. William Harrison Ainsworth visited the city of Malatya in 1837, noting a population of 8,000 Muslims, chiefly Turks, and 3,000 Armenians.

== Climate ==

Malatya has a cold semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;) or a temperate continental climate (Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Dca&quot;), with hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters.

Highest recorded temperature: on 14 August 2019&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 28 December 1953

== Economy ==

The economy of the city of Malatya is dominated by agriculture, textile manufacturing, and construction. As with the general province, apricot production is important for subsistence in the central district. Malatya is the world leader in apricot production. The city has two organized industrial zones, where the chief industry is textile.

Historically, Malatya produced opium. The British, in 1920, described the opium from Malatya as having &quot;the highest percentage of morphia&quot;.

== Culture ==

=== Cuisine ===
KÃ¶fte (meatballs) are used in many meals from kebabs (meat broiled or roasted in small pieces) to desserts. There are over 70 kinds of kÃ¶fte, usually made with wheat and other ingredients. KaÄÄ±t kebabÄ± is a local specialty â a dish made of lamb and vegetables broiled in a wrapper, usually oily paper. Other important dishes are a variety of stuffed specialties, including stuffed mulberry leaves, cabbage, chard, lettuce wraps with olive oil, vine leaves, cherry leaves, bean leaves, grape leaves, beets, onions, and zucchini flowers.

The Malatya region is known for its apricot orchards. About 50% of the fresh apricot production and 95% of the dried apricot production in Turkey, the world&#x27;s leading apricot producer, is provided by Malatya. Overall, about 10â15% of the worldwide crop of fresh apricots, and about 65â80% of the worldwide production of dried apricots comes out of Malatya. Malatya apricots are often sun-dried by family-run orchards using traditional methods before export.

=== Festivals ===

Malatya Fair and Apricot Festivities has been held since 1978, every year in July, to promote Malatya and apricots and to convene the producers to meet one another. During the festivities, sports activities, concerts and apricot contests are organized.

Near the Apricot Festivities, there are other annual activities in summer. Cherry Festivities at YeÅilyurt District of Malatya and Grape Festivities at Arapgir District are organized annually.

=== Sports ===
Malatya&#x27;s initial team is Malatyaspor whose colors are red and yellow. Malatyaspor competes in Malatya First Amateur League. Malatyaspor plays their home games in Malatya Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ Stadium in the city&#x27;s center. Malatya&#x27;s other team is Yeni Malatyaspor (formerly Malatya Belediyespor) whose colors are black and yellow (formerly green and orange). They compete in TFF 1.Lig .

== Administration and politics ==

Malatya is administered by a metropolitan municipality, which covers the whole province. There are two central districts, each with their own municipalities, that make up the city of Malatya: these are Battalgazi and YeÅilyurt. Battalgazi has a population of around 300,000 and covers 47 central neighbourhoods, three rural former municipalities and 28 villages. YeÅilyurt contains 36 central neighborhoods, three rural former municipalities and 16 villages, and has a population of around 250,000. The metropolitan municipality was won in 2014 by Ahmet ÃakÄ±r of the ruling AK Party with 62.9% of the vote; the candidate of the CHP was in the second place with 16.7% of the vote. Battalgazi was won by Selahattin GÃ¼rkan of the AK Party with 63.1% of the vote and YeÅilyurt was won HacÄ± UÄur Polat of the AK Party with 62.4% of the vote. The two central districts voted overwhelmingly in favour of the AK Party in the June 2015 election with AK Party winning 66.2% of the vote in Battalgazi and 56.9% in YeÅilyurt. These percentages further increased in the November 2015 election to 74.7% and 66.2% respectively. In both elections, CHP had the second place in both districts with its votes remaining in the range of 10â18%.

By its relative advance in industrial growth, Malatya is a pole of attraction for its surrounding regions, in commercial and inward immigration. The city is at a key junction in Turkey&#x27;s road and rail network. By rail, it serves as the junction for Aleppo through SyriaâSamsun line. The bus terminal is 5Â km west of the city center; there are regular intercity services to and from Ankara, Istanbul and Gaziantep. The railway station is 3Â km west of the city center, and daily express trains run to ElazÄ±Ä, DiyarbakÄ±r, Istanbul and Ankara. These stations are easily reached by taxis and dolmuÅ services.

Construction of a trolleybus line was under way in 2013, and the line opened in March 2015, operating under the name Trambus. It serves a route that is around in length and connects MaÅti bus station (MaÅti Otogar), in the west, with Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ University (Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ Ãniversitesi), in the east.

Malatya&#x27;s airport, ErhaÃ§ Airport, is 26Â  km west of the city center. There are daily domestic flights from Istanbul, Ankara and Ä°zmir. Since 2007 there have been international flights during the summer months.

<doc id="1291891" wikidata="Q3506492" url="?curid=1291891" title="Pinus quadrifolia">
<text>Pinus quadrifolia, the Parry pinyon, is a pine in the pinyon pine group native to southernmost California in the United States and northern Baja California in Mexico, from 33Â° 30&#x27; N south to 30Â° 30&#x27; N. The Parry pinyon has a lifespan of around 200 to 500 years. It is usually found in rocky areas that often have thin soil. It occurs at moderate altitudes from to , rarely as low as and as high as . It is scarce and often scattered in this region, forming open woodlands, usually mixed with junipers. Other common names include nut pine and fourleaf pinyon pine.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus quadrifolia&quot; is a small to medium size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to , rarely more. The bark is thick, rough and scaly. The leaves (needles) are in fascicles of 4â5, moderately stout, long; glossy dark green with no stomata on the outer face, and a dense bright white band of stomata on the inner surfaces. The Parry pinyon begins to grow cones at around 10 to 20 years, and seed production is maximized at 50 or more years of age. The cones are globose, long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow to orange-buff when 18â20 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5â10 fertile scales.

The cones open to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are long, with a thin shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial wing; they are dispersed by the pinyon jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. In addition to birds, rodents and other mammals can distribute its seeds.

===Hybrids===
The Parry pinyon frequently hybridises with single-leaf pinyon (&quot;P. monophylla&quot;) where their ranges meet in southern California and northern Baja California. Hybrids are distinguished by intermediate features, with needles usually fascicles of 2â3 with some stomata on the outer surface. It has been suggested by some botanists that the holotype specimen of &quot;P. quadrifolia&quot; is itself from a hybrid; presumed pure, non-hybrid specimens having been given the new name &quot;Pinus juarezensis&quot;, the JuÃ¡rez pinyon, after the Sierra de JuÃ¡rez of northern Baja California. However, there is no proof that these specimens are genetically &#x27;purer&#x27; than the original type specimen, and few botanists accept &quot;P. juarezensis&quot; as other than a synonym of &quot;P. quadrifolia&quot;.

Despite the ease of hybridisation with single-leaf pinyon, Parry pinyon is genetically probably more closely related to the Johann&#x27;s pinyon (&quot;P. johannis&quot;) and PotosÃ­ pinyon (&quot;P. culminicola&quot;), despite being separated from them by well over .

=== Fire Ecology and Effects ===
The low density of organic material in areas where the Parry pinyon is found reduces the risk of fires spreading. However, due to low-hanging branches and thin bark, the Parry pinyon itself is susceptible to fire. Larger Parry pinyons can survive fires of low to moderate heat, but younger pinyons can be wiped out by fires. The Parry pinyon does not possess the ability to resprout after a fire.

==Uses==
The edible seeds, pine nuts, are collected throughout its range, though it is much less important than Colorado pinyon (&quot;P. edulis&quot;) for the crop. Parry pinyon is also occasionally planted as an ornamental tree and sometimes used as a Christmas tree. Due to the limited distribution of the species, the seeds of the Parry pinyon are not gathered commercially. They are more often consumed by birds, rodents (especially woodrats) and other mammals. The Cahuilla tribe of southern California used the resin to make a face cream commonly used by girls to prevent sunburn. The nuts were useful as well. For the Cahuilla, the nuts were given to the babies to eat as an alternative from breast milk and were also grounded then mixed with water as a beverage. The nuts were roasted and eaten whole or made into mush. They were important to the Cahuilla as a trade item with neighboring tribes. The pine needles and roots were used as material for basketry and the bark was a reliable substance for making the roofs of houses. The resin was a glue for mending pottery and reattaching arrowheads to the arrow shafts. The wood was burnt for firewood and incense, since it had high combustibility and it gave a pleasant smell.

The Diegueno also ate the nuts, but also the seeds as well.

<text>The Hugh Lane Gallery, and originally the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, is an art museum operated by Dublin City Council and its wholly-owned company, the Hugh Lane Gallery Trust. It is in Charlemont House (built 1763) on Parnell Square, Dublin, Ireland. Admission is free.

== History ==
The gallery was founded by noted art collector Sir Hugh Lane on Harcourt Street on 20 January 1908, and is the first known public gallery of modern art in the world. Lane met the running costs, while seeking a more permanent home. New buildings were proposed in St. Stephens Green, and as a dramatic bridge-gallery over the River Liffey, both proposed designs by Sir Edwin Lutyens, both unrealised. Lane did not live to see his gallery permanently located as he died in 1915 during the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Since 1933 it has been housed in Charlemont House.

Lane&#x27;s will bequeathed his collection to London, but an unwitnessed codicil, written in the months prior to his death, bequeathed the 39 paintings to Dublin on the condition that a permanent gallery was secured within 5 years. London&#x27;s National Gallery did not recognise the codicil, and all the paintings form the Lane Bequest in their collection. In 1938, the British put forward a suggestion from Sir Robert Witt: &quot;...that these pictures should alternate between London and Dublin. We have had them in London for a considerable number of years, and it might now be the turn of the Dublin Galleries to have them for a number of years... Legally, the holders have a very strong case, but we are so wealthy in our treasures, while Ireland is so comparatively poor...&quot;

This eventually led to a compromise agreement in 1959, announced by Taoiseach SeÃ¡n Lemass, whereby half of the Lane Bequest would be lent and shown in Dublin every five years. In 1993, the agreement was changed so that 31 of the 39 paintings would stay in Ireland. The remaining 8 were divided into 2 groups, so that 4 would be lent for 6 years at a time to Dublin. These 8 include works by Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Morisot, Vuillard and Degas. In 2008, The National Gallery in London arranged for the entire collection to be on display in Dublin together for the first time. There was a switch in May 2013 for a six-year period.

== Building ==
Charlemont House is a mansion in Dublin, Ireland. The house was built in 1763 and designed by William Chambers for James Caulfeild, the 1st Earl of Charlemont. It is a brick-fronted mansion on Dublin&#x27;s Parnell Square. According to the Hugh Lane Gallery, &quot;in 1929 the gardens of the house were built upon to accommodate the Gallery&quot;. It was opened as a museum in 1933. The gallery was closed for reconstruction in 2004, and reopened in May 2006, with a new extension by Gilroy McMahon Architects. The gallery is completely wheelchair-accessible.

== Collection ==

The museum has a permanent collection and hosts exhibitions, mostly by contemporary Irish artists. It has a dedicated Sean Scully room. Francis Bacon&#x27;s studio was reconstructed in the gallery in 2001 after being dismantled and moved from London starting in 1998.

The Hugh Lane is notable for its collection of French art, the Lane Bequest pictures including works such as &quot;The Umbrellas&quot; &quot;(Les Parapluies)&quot; by Auguste Renoir; &quot;Portrait of Eva GonzalÃ¨s&quot; by Ãdouard Manet, Ãdouard Manet&#x27;s &quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot;, &quot;Jour dâÃtÃ©&quot; by Berthe Morisot and &quot;View of Louveciennes&quot; by Camille Pissarro.

There is a permanent display of stained glass at the museum which features &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; by Irish artist and illustrator Harry Clarke. As well as a previously banned, &quot;scandalous&quot; work of his, which was purchased in 2015 for Â£35,000.

In June 1992, the painting &quot;In The Omnibus&quot; by French artist Honore Daumier was stolen. The theft took place in the afternoon during the hours when the gallery was open to the public. The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) recovered the painting during an investigation in 2013, more than 20 years later. Director Barbara Dawson expressed her delight that the painting had been found. She said, &quot;It was such a shock when it was stolen and we had messages of sympathy from galleries and museums in Ireland and around the world.&quot;

==Selected past exhibitions==

&quot;Offside&quot; was a 2005 project in The Hugh Lane curated by Pallas Projects and included works by Albano Afonso, Antistrot, Anna Boyle, Rhona Byrne, Mark Cullen, Brian Duggan, John Dummet, Brendan Earley, Andreas Gefeller, Niamh McCann, Alex McCullagh, Nina McGowan, Nathaniel Mellors, Clive Murphy, Adriette Myburgh, Cris Neumann, Paul OâNeill, Garrett Phelan, Abigail Reynolds, Mark Titchner, Rich Streitmatter-Tran.

The Golden Bough was a series of exhibitions curated by Michael Dempsey in 2010. It included solo shows by Ronnie Hughes, Corban Walker and Niamh McCann.

&quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; (2012â15) curated by Michael Dempsey and Logan Sisley was a two-year project in which six artists (Clodagh Emoe, Lee Welch, Sean Lynch, Linda Quinlan, Jim Ricks, and Gavin Murphy) were invited to use the museum&#x27;s resources, reveal their artistic process, and to collaborate with each other in this &quot;unusual experiment in exhibition production&quot;. This process culminated in each artist developing a solo exhibition at the Hugh Lane and a publication.

Kennedy Browne, consisting of Gareth Kennedy and Sarah Browne, exhibited 3 films as the &quot;Redaction Trilogy,&quot; 2019â20.

The largest Andy Warhol show to ever come to Ireland opened in October 2023 at The Hugh Lane. Tilted &quot;Andy Warhol Three Times Out&quot;, it is the first Warhol exhibit in the country in 25 years.

<text>Charles Joseph Weis Sr. (born March 30, 1956) is a former American football coach. He was the head coach for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish from 2005 to 2009 and the Kansas Jayhawks from 2012 to 2014. He also served as an offensive coordinator in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets, New England Patriots, and Kansas City Chiefs. Weis most recently hosted &quot;Airing It Out,&quot; along with Bob Papa, on Sirius XM NFL Radio.

==Coaching career==
After graduating from Notre Dame in 1978, Weis began his coaching career at Boonton High School in New Jersey. He spent the next five seasons at perennial powerhouse Morristown High School in New Jersey as a football assistant developing players such as Michael Landsberg. In 1985, he was hired by head coach Joe Morrison at the University of South Carolina, where he received his master&#x27;s degree in education while working as a graduate assistant position coach and assistant recruiting coordinator. He served four seasons on the Gamecock staff until Morrison died in 1989. He then returned to New Jersey as the head coach at Franklin High School and directed Franklin Township to the New Jersey state championship while also assisting in the New York Giants&#x27; pro personnel department.

===Early years===
Weis launched his professional coaching career in 1990 when he was named offensive assistant and assistant special teams coach under Giants head coach Bill Parcells. The Giants went on to win Super Bowl XXV at the end of that season, beating the Buffalo Bills by a score of 20â19.

After Ray Handley took over as head coach in 1991, Weis stayed on as the running back coach for two seasons. In 1991, he helped guide 2nd year running back Rodney Hampton to 1,059 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground. The Giants finished 6th in rushing yards and 7th in rushing touchdowns in the NFL. The next year, Weis utilized both Hampton (1,141 yards and 14 touchdowns) and Jarrod Bunch (501 yards and 3 touchdowns) to form a potent running back combination. The Giants finished 6th in rushing yards and 2nd in rushing touchdowns in the NFL.

After that he began a four-year stint with the New England Patriots. For the first two years (1993â1994), Weis served as the tight end coach. In 1995, he would switch to running back coach and finished 1996 as wide receiver coach. In 1993, he helped Ben Coates break out with 659 yards and 8 touchdowns. Marv Cook proved a reliable blocker as well. In 1994, Coates had one of the best seasons by a tight end ever with 96 catches, 1174 yards, and 7 touchdowns. In 1995, Weis helped turn rookie Curtis Martin&#x27;s year into a Pro Bowl season with 1,487 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground. Dave Meggett and Sam Gash proved to be reliable receivers out of the backfield as well with a combined 78 catches. Terry Glenn broke out with 90 catches for 1,132 yards and 6 touchdowns. Weis also helped wide receiver Shawn Jefferson put up 771 yards and 4 touchdowns along with developing Troy Brown into a solid role player with 21 catches for 222 yards.

In 1997, Weis became the offensive coordinator of the Jets, in addition to duties as the team&#x27;s primary receivers coach. In his second year as offensive coordinator, the Jets finished fourth in the National Football League in offense. Weis served as the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator from 1997 to 1999.

===New England Patriots===
Weis returned to New England Patriots following Parcells&#x27; announced retirement after the 1999 season. He served as offensive coordinator under head coach Bill Belichick from 2000 through 2004, installing the Erhardt-Perkins offensive system, and assisting the Patriots in three Super Bowl victories (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX).

===Notre Dame===
On November 30, 2004, after finishing its football season with a 6â5 record, Notre Dame released head coach Tyrone Willingham. After first choice Urban Meyer accepted the head coaching position at the University of Florida, Notre Dame hired Weis on December 12, 2004, as the 28th football coach in the school&#x27;s history with a six-year contract worth a reported US$2 million per year. He was the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the position since Hugh Devore (a 1934 graduate) served as interim coach in 1945 and 1963, and the first alumnus to serve as the Irish football coach on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich (a 1938 Notre Dame graduate), who coached in South Bend from 1959 to 1962.

;2005

In his first season as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Weis was widely quoted as telling his team that they would have a &quot;decided schematic advantage&quot; against their opponents, apparently in the belief that his schemes and strategies developed in the NFL were superior to the schemes being run by other college coaches. Indeed, the team&#x27;s play, particularly that of junior quarterback Brady Quinn and junior wide receiver Jeff Samardzija, improved greatly. Samardzija, previously a little-used wide receiver, became Quinn&#x27;s favorite target and a frequent game-breaker, and set school records for most touchdown receptions in a season (15), most receiving yardage in a season (1,249), and most consecutive games with a touchdown reception (8), after having no touchdown receptions in his previous two years at Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost to Michigan State in a dramatic overtime loss. Weis was quoted as saying they would never again lose to Michigan State on his watch. He went 2â3 against the Spartans over his career.

With a record of 9â2, his team finished the regular season ranked sixth in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings, granting them a berth in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona, on January 2, 2006, which they lost to the Ohio State Buckeyes by a score of 34â20. The Irish finished ninth in the final AP Poll and eleventh in the Coaches Poll. His team&#x27;s success on the field helped make Weis winner of the 2005 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award, selected by the Football Writers Association of America.

On October 29, 2005, barely halfway through the first year of a six-year contract, and with a 5â2 record, Weis signed a contract extension with Notre Dame. The new 10-year deal, which began with the 2006 season, and which was to be worth a reported $30â40 million, would keep Weis at Notre Dame through 2015.

;2006

During the 2006 season, Weis led the Fighting Irish to a 10â2 regular season record, and a second straight BCS berth, this time losing 41â14 in the Sugar Bowl to the LSU Tigers. This loss was the second straight bowl loss under Weis and the ninth straight bowl loss for the Irish. The Irish finished No. 17 in the final AP poll, and No. 19 in the final Coaches&#x27; Poll. While this season could be considered a disappointment based on Notre Dame&#x27;s No. 2 pre-season ranking, Weis led the Irish to its second straight season of nine wins or more, something not achieved since the 1992 and 1993 seasons under Lou Holtz. Also for the second straight year Weis put together a top 10 recruiting class, including national player of the year Jimmy Clausen.

;2007

In the 2007 season, Notre Dame went 3â9, with their only wins coming against UCLA, Duke and Stanford. Their loss to Navy on November 3 snapped an NCAA-record 43-game winning streak over the Midshipmen, dating back to the Heisman Trophy-winning tenure of Roger Staubach at the Naval Academy. The team ranked near the bottom of Division I FBS in both rushing yards per game and total yards per game. Along with being third from last in scoring per game, the team was shut out twice en route to its first nine-loss season ever. Weis attributed the team&#x27;s downfall to his own mistakes, including his failure to use full-speed practices and to develop his players properly, his installation of two separate offensive systems, one for each potential starting quarterback, as well as to the graduation of star quarterback Brady Quinn. Despite the poor season, which was Notre Dame&#x27;s worst ever (by losses), Weis nonetheless managed to recruit one of the top recruiting classes in the country.

;2008

In 2008, The Irish started 4â1, but completed the regular season with a 6â6 record, including a 24â23 loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team. The combined 15 losses from 2007 to 2008 marks the most losses for any two-year span. Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, Notre Dame retained Weis for the 2009 season. Weis&#x27;s Notre Dame squad ended the season on a positive note, finally breaking the Irish&#x27;s NCAA record nine-game bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii 49â21. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total of the season, its highest point total ever in a bowl game, and broke 8 other bowl records. The bowl win also helped Notre Dame to a 7â6 final record, its 102nd winning season in 120 years of football and Weis&#x27; third in four years. Notre Dame ended the year with a top 15 recruiting class, including signing the top defensive player in the nation.

;2009
The Fighting Irish finished the 2009 regular season with a 6â6 record. A poor record for the season in addition to high preseason expectations for the team, including a preseason top 25 ranking, caused widespread speculation that Notre Dame would fire Weis. Weis was fired on November 30, 2009. He was succeeded by Brian Kelly.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
Weis was named offensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs for 2010. In Weis&#x27;s first year, the Chiefs improved from a record of 4â12 to 10â6 and returned to the playoffs after winning the AFC West Division. With Weis as offensive coordinator, the Chiefs had the NFL&#x27;s best rushing attack, averaging an impressive 165 yards per game on the ground. Offensively the Chiefs ranked 9th in total offense, 11th in points per game, and 1st in rushing, but 28th in passing. However, the Chiefs also sent four players on offense (WR Dwayne Bowe, RB Jamaal Charles, QB Matt Cassel and OG Brian Waters) to the Pro Bowl. Cassel, Bowe and Charles made their first ever trip to the Pro Bowl. Weis has also been credited with the improvement of Cassel who had a career year throwing for 27 touchdowns and only 5 interceptions in 14 games.

===Florida===
On December 31, 2010, ESPN reported that Weis was targeted by the Florida Gators to become the next offensive coordinator under new head coach Will Muschamp. On January 2, 2011, Chiefs coach Todd Haley announced Weis would indeed be leaving for the Florida offensive coordinator position effective at the end of the season. Weis&#x27; tenure was broadly criticized after the team finished ranked 102nd nationally with just 334.17 yards per game.

===Kansas===
On December 8, 2011, Weis was named the head football coach for the University of Kansas replacing Turner Gill. He initially stated that he would not stay longer than the duration of his five-year contract, which would have run out in 2016, but school officials persuaded him to consider a longer stay. His 2012 team struggled to a 1â11 record in what was dubbed as a rebuilding year. Weis&#x27; 2013 team showed signs of improvement. Although they only compiled a 3â9 record, Weis&#x27; Jayhawks ended a 27-game Big 12 Conference losing streak with a 31â19 home victory over West Virginia in November 2013. Weis was fired on September 28, 2014, four games into the season. School officials did not believe the Jayhawks had made enough strides on the field during Weis&#x27; tenure. According to ESPN, they were also concerned about declining attendance. Despite pleas from Weis, only 36,900 people came to what would be his final game in Lawrence, against Texas.

==Personal life==

Weis and his wife, Maura, have two children, Charles Joseph &quot;Charlie&quot; and Hannah Margaret. Charlie Jr. is the co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). In 2003, Weis and his wife established the Hannah &amp; Friends Foundation, dedicated to children affected by developmental disorders and named after his daughter, who is autistic. In the spring of 2004, the inaugural Hannah &amp; Friends Celebrity Golf Classic was held to benefit the foundation.

Weis told YES Network commentators at the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers MLB game on Friday, July 17, 2009, that his favorite baseball team is the Yankees. He was there to celebrate the announcement of the Notre Dame and Army football game to be played at the new Yankee Stadium in November 2010.

Weis was born in Trenton, New Jersey, and grew up in Middlesex, New Jersey, where he graduated from Middlesex High School. Weis was inducted to Middlesex High School Athletics Hall of Fame- Class of 2024 on May 4, 2024. Weis played High School Football as the center for the class of 1976. He has one older sister and three younger brothers, one of whom attended West Point. Charlie had another brother named Pete.

===Health issues===
In 2002, Weis underwent gastric bypass surgery, after which he lost from his top weight of . When asked why he underwent surgery, Weis stated he was afraid he would &quot;drop dead&quot; from obesity. Because of complications from the surgery, Weis spent two weeks in a coma and nearly died. Weis was so close to death that he reportedly received the Catholic last rites. Weis later sued the doctors who performed the surgery for malpractice and lost. A major reason cited for the jury&#x27;s decision is that Weis ignored doctors&#x27; advice and pushed to have the operation done quickly, rather than going through a recommended six-week preoperative program.

During a game against Michigan on September 13, 2008, Notre Dame defensive end John Ryan accidentally collided with Weis on the sideline. Weis sustained tears to his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament, for which he underwent surgery.

<text>The Rebar Group (Rebar; ) is a large corporation involved in domestic textiles, construction, hotel/real estate, retail services, vehicle/building insurance, banking, and media in Taiwan.
==History==
The company started out in the 1960s as a reinforcement bar manufacturer, hence its name.

The corporation recently gained large shares of the Taiwanese cable media as OmniMedia (æ±æ£®) TV Corp and also mobile telephone business as Asia Pacific Telecom Group (äºå¤ª) in the late 1990s.

Towards the end of 2006 Rebar was encountering serious difficulties following years of allegedly hiding financial problems with bad loans from The Chinese Bank. The CEO and founder, Wang You-theng (çåæ¾) is alleged to have engaged in insider trading and embezzlement in connection to this, and fled Taiwan on 30 December 2006, days before prosecutors began their investigation. You-theng was detained in the U.S. and was wanted by Taiwanese prosecutors for allegedly embezzling NT$60 billion (US$1.8 billion) in corporate funds. He died in May 2016 in a traffic accident.

==Branches==
Branches include:

* TV: OmniMedia (æ±æ£®)
* Finance: Chinese Bank, Union Insurance
* Service: Rebar Realstate, Rebar Retail Chain, Rebar Hotel, Taipei Aquarium
* Manufacturing: Rebar Construction, Rebar Foods (esp. cooking oil)

<text>: &quot;This article is part of the history of rail transport by country series.&quot;

The history of [[rail transport in Canada]] began in the early 19th century. The Canadian railway system saw several expansion &quot;booms&quot; throughout history, as well as a major change from broad to standard gauge which occurred in the 1870s. An initially disconnected system was gradually integrated with the American railway network, as Canadian and American railway companies built lines and bought smaller companies in each other&#x27;s country. The Intercolonial Railway, a product of Canadian Confederation, was Canada&#x27;s first major experiment in railway nationalization, and following Confederation, several transcontinental railways were built.

Many Canadian railways were gradually brought together under large conglomerates, but by the end of the First World War, the sudden and decisive financial collapse of these conglomerates created a deep threat to Canadian infrastructure and economy, leading to their nationalization under the Dominion government. This nationalization and consolidation process produced the Canadian National Railways (CNR), which was owned by the Canadian federal government until 1995. The Great Depression led to a decline in rail traffic, and the sudden reversal of this during the Second World War left railways with overtaxed, aging, and poorly-maintained infrastructure. Toward the end of the 1950s, railways began to transition toward diesel trains. Ridership on passenger trains declined postwar, leading to railways to pursue their abandonment. Nationally, most passenger services were transferred to a new crown agency, Via Rail.

==Early tramways==

Canada coalesced into a state following millennia of First Nations habitation, as well as centuries of habitation by European settlers. Different parts of the country were settled at different times, with their transport systems laid out in reflection of the era. Early transport patterns of indigenous peoples and voyageurs followed large natural waterways such as the Great Lakes waterway system, the Saint Lawrence River, and the Ottawa River. This was suitable for the fur trade, which involved the transport of light, high-value commodities by boat early in its history.

The earliest recognizably railway-like system in recorded Canadian history was an industrial tramway on Cape Breton Island, which is said to have been built around 1720. The existence of a tramway, as opposed to simply a road, is poorly attested in written and archaeological records, but was present in local oral history in the early 20th century. This tramway has been cited in various sources as an example of a pre-steam railway in North America, despite a lack of evidence confirming its existence. Remaining physical evidence has led to the belief that it was used for transporting coal to the Fortress of Louisbourg from mines on the island, during a period when the island was under French control. There is also some speculation that it was used in the construction of the fortress.

Several other tramway systems were constructed before the 1830s. The first was a combined wagonway and incline tramway near Niagara Falls along what is now the American side of the CanadaâUnited States border. It was built by the British in 1762 near the end of the French and Indian War. The challenging geography of the Niagara Peninsula meant that until the later construction of canals, there was no navigable water route between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, so transport between the two required the use of a portage. The French had long sought to take control of the portage trail from the Seneca, who had taken control of it from the Neutral Nation in the mid-17th century, amidst the Beaver Wars. The French tried to control this key point with repeated military expeditions and fortifications throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries, including Fort Conti in 1679, Fort Denonville in 1687, and Fort Niagara in 1726. The British gained control of the portage by the 1760s, but their efforts to replace the system of Seneca porters with a tramway met with resistance from the Seneca. The situation erupted in violence with the Battle of Devil&#x27;s Hole, a part of Pontiac&#x27;s War. A warband of several hundred Seneca ambushed a British wagon train, massacring many of the teamsters and their soldier escorts. The British ultimately retained control of the portage and continued to use and maintain its tramway until their surrender of the land to the United States following the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

Another recorded incline tramway system was in Quebec City and was constructed in the 1820s, possibly as early as 1823. It marked several firsts in Canada: it was the first known double-track railway, the first steam-powered railway, and the first railway system known to have carried passengers regularly. It was built on Cap Diamant to haul stone and other construction materials for the Citadelle of Quebec up from a wharf below. The tramway was powered by a stationary steam engine and was a permanent structure that operated until the late 1840s, when it was shut down due to its inconvenient location. Throughout the construction of the citadel, the general public was allowed to ride it as passengers, making it technically one of the earliest railways in Canada to carry passengers. A similar system, the Old Quebec Funicular, was later built in 1879 in a different location in the city.
==First railway boom==

The first Canadian railway, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, was opened in 1836 outside of Montreal, a seasonal portage railway to connect river traffic. It was followed by the Albion Railway in Stellarton, Nova Scotia in 1840, a collier railway connecting coal mines to a seaport.

Heavy expansion of the rail system did not get under way until the &quot;Railway Guarantee Act&quot; of 1849 that guaranteed bond returns on all railways over 75 miles. This led to rapid expansion of railway in the Canadas, sometimes excessive growth as uneconomic lines were built since the government guaranteed profits.

However, this proved disastrous for government finances, and the Canadas were all but bankrupted by the subsidies. The largest rail project of this period was also a disaster. The Grand Trunk Railway linking Montreal to Sarnia was finished in 1860, but was vastly mired in debt. In exchange for bailing out the company the government escaped its guarantee on the railway bonds.

==Transcontinental expansion==

Canadian Confederation was in part brought about by the railways. The local governments had all but emptied their treasuries building railways, and a new and more stable method of financing them was required. It was also believed that union would allow for the needed construction of railroads linking British North America. The Maritimes joined largely because of promises to build the Intercolonial Railway, and British Columbia only because of a promise to build a transcontinental railroad.

The government had learnt its lesson and these railways were not funded by guarantees. Rather, the construction of the Intercolonial was fully controlled by the government under the direction of Sandford Fleming.

The railway to the Pacific, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), was financed by private funds and through massive land grants in the Canadian prairies, much of it of little value until the railway arrived, $25 million in cash and a guaranteed monopoly. The railway, then the longest in the world, was completed in 1885 to great fanfare.

The booming Canadian economy after 1900 led to plans to build two new transcontinental railways. The Canadian Northern, a successful system covering the northern part of the prairies, and the Grand Trunk (through its Grand Trunk Pacific subsidiary) both launched ambitious plans to expand. The government at first encouraged the two to come to some arrangement and only have one new line, but in the end no agreement was made and the government supported the expansion of both lines. The federal government itself built the National Transcontinental Railway, a line from Moncton to Winnipeg, passing through the vast and uninhabited hinterland of the Canadian Shield.

==Nationalization effort==

This aggressive expansion proved disastrous when immigration and supplies of capital all but disappeared with the outbreak of the First World War. The Canadian Northern, Grand Trunk Pacific, and Grand Trunk were nationalized by the federal government, which absorbed the debt of over two billion dollars. All three railways, along with the Canadian Government Railways (formed by the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, and several smaller lines) were then merged into the Canadian National Railways in 1923.

The years after the First World War saw only moderate expansion of the rail network and the age of the great railways were over in Canada. The automobile provided strong competition by the 1920s, and after the Second World War most passenger service was lost to airlines.

The Canadian National Railways was one of the earliest diesel train operators in North America. The CNR experimented with self-propelled &quot;oil-electric&quot; cars starting in 1924. Diesels slowly became more prominent as yard switchers in the following decades. A prominent debut of diesel railway locomotion in Canada was in 1929, when CN No. 9000, built by the Canadian Locomotive Company using diesel engines imported from Britain, was used on the &quot;International Limited&quot;, the flagship train of the former Grand Trunk Railway.

==Postwar period==

The &quot;National Transportation Act&quot; of 1967 was an attempt at comprehensive transportation reform. It provided government subsidies for branch lines and passenger services, which at the time were still operated primarily by Canadian National and Canadian Pacific.

In 1978, Canadian National passenger services were transferred to a new federal agency, Via Rail. CN was privatized in November 1995.

<doc id="1291932" wikidata="Q842193" url="?curid=1291932" title="Sandbox (computer security)">
<text>In computer security, a sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs, usually in an effort to mitigate system failures and/or software vulnerabilities from spreading. The sandbox metaphor derives from the concept of a child&#x27;s sandboxâa play area where children can build, destroy, and experiment without causing any real-world damage. It is often used to kill untested or untrusted programs or code, possibly from unverified or untrusted third parties, suppliers, users or websites, without risking harm to the host machine or operating system. A sandbox typically provides a tightly controlled set of resources for guest programs to run in, such as storage and memory scratch space. Network access, the ability to inspect the host system, or read from input devices are usually disallowed or heavily restricted.

In the sense of providing a highly controlled environment, sandboxes may be seen as a specific example of virtualization. Sandboxing is frequently used to test unverified programs that may contain a virus or other malicious code without allowing the software to harm the host device.

== Implementations ==
A sandbox is implemented by executing the software in a restricted operating system environment, thus controlling the resources (e.g. file descriptors, memory, file system space, etc.) that a process may use.

Examples of sandbox implementations include the following:
* Linux application sandboxing, built on Seccomp, cgroups and Linux namespaces. Notably used by Systemd, Google Chrome, Firefox, Firejail.
* Android was the first mainstream operating system to implement full application sandboxing, built by assigning each application its own Linux user ID.
* Apple App Sandbox is required for apps distributed through Apple&#x27;s Mac App Store and iOS/iPadOS App Store, and recommended for other signed apps.
* Windows Vista and later editions include a &quot;low&quot; mode process running, known as &quot;User Account Control&quot; (UAC), which only allows writing in a specific directory and registry keys. Windows 10 Pro, from version 1903, provides a feature known as Windows Sandbox.
* Google Sandboxed API.
* Virtual machines emulate a complete host computer, on which a conventional operating system may boot and run as on actual hardware. The guest operating system runs sandboxed in the sense that it does not function natively on the host and can only access host resources through the emulator.
* A jail: network-access restrictions, and a restricted file system namespace. Jails are most commonly used in virtual hosting.
* Rule-based execution gives users full control over what processes are started, spawned (by other applications), or allowed to inject code into other applications and have access to the net, by having the system assign access levels for users or programs according to a set of determined rules. It also can control file/registry security (what programs can read and write to the file system/registry). In such an environment, viruses and Trojans have fewer opportunities for infecting a computer. The SELinux and Apparmor security frameworks are two such implementations for Linux.
* Security researchers rely heavily on sandboxing technologies to analyse malware behavior. By creating an environment that mimics or replicates the targeted desktops, researchers can evaluate how malware infects and compromises a target host. Numerous malware analysis services are based on the sandboxing technology.
* Google Native Client is a sandbox for running compiled C and C++ code in the browser efficiently and securely, independent of the user&#x27;s operating system.
* Capability systems can be thought of as a fine-grained sandboxing mechanism, in which programs are given opaque tokens when spawned and have the ability to do specific things based on what tokens they hold. Capability-based implementations can work at various levels, from kernel to user-space. An example of capability-based user-level sandboxing involves HTML rendering in a Web browser.
* Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) strict mode, seccomp only allows the codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4 system calls.
* HTML5 has a &quot;sandbox&quot; attribute for use with iframes.
* Java virtual machines include a sandbox to restrict the actions of untrusted code, such as a Java applet.
* The .NET Common Language Runtime provides Code Access Security to enforce restrictions on untrusted code.
* Software Fault Isolation (SFI), allows running untrusted native code by sandboxing all store, read and jump assembly instructions to isolated segments of memory. 
Some of the use cases for sandboxes include the following:
* Online judge systems to test programs in programming contests.
* New-generation pastebins allowing users to execute pasted code snippets on the pastebin&#x27;s server.

<text>Thomas Watson Harvey (November 27, 1893 â June 27, 1978) was President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA) from 1956 to 1978.

==Biography==
Harvey was born in Douglas, Burke County, Georgia, the oldest of twelve children of Walker and Billie Harvey. His father was a farmer and both his grandparents were slaves. He was named after Thomas E. Watson, the leader of the Populist Party in Georgia who at the time was a champion of Georgia&#x27;s dispossessed, both black and white.

Harvey left Douglas as a young man seeking employment. His travels led him to Waynesboro, Augusta, Atlanta and other towns in the rural area. He became increasingly agitated as he became aware of his plight of black Americans, and he travelled north in search of a better life. He arrived in Philadelphia in 1917 at the age of 22. In 1919 he was discharged from the U.S. Army. Soon afterwards he became involved with the UNIA and its founder, Marcus Garvey, and became one of the thirteen students taught by Garvey in the School of African philosophy.

He joined the Association in 1919 and became very active, rising from ordinary membership to the successive positions of lieutenant of the African Legions, commissioner of the State of New York, Commissioner of the State of Ohio, High Chancellor of the Parent Body (when the Parent Body was located in London, England), Confidante of Mr. Garvey, and division president. In 1938 he distanced himself from Senator Theodore Bilbo, following the latter&#x27;s use of racist invective in promoting the repatriation of African Americans under the age of 40 as an amendment to the House Joint Resolution 679.

Finally, Harvey was elected President-General of the UNIA Rehabilitating Committee in Detroit in 1951. Shortly afterwards he established the &quot;Garvey&#x27;s Voice&quot; newspaper. He was elected again to the post again in 1960, and was re-elected every four years until his death; his many years of service often included minor tasks such as painting a room, sweeping or preparing meals for visitors. He was known as a peacemaker, and as a spokesman who believed staunchly in Garvey&#x27;s philosophy and opinions.

The rest of his association with the UNIA can be documented by members of the organization who knew him well. In his travels from Georgia to various cities, the Senate Chamber, university campuses, and offices of foreign and domestic government officials, he touched the lives of many people. He was renowned for his patience with and commitment to his fellow men.

One of the highpoints of Harvey&#x27;s career was the creation and founding of the African Project in 1966 under the leadership of the late Reverend Clarence Harding, Jr. The project was located in Monrovia, Liberia, and included a fully accredited school under the Garvey Memorial Foundation, headed by the minister of education.

Harvey died in 1978 at the home of his daughter, Jean Slappy of Philadelphia. He was 84 years old. His funeral took place at Antioch Second Baptist Church, and he was interred at Mount Lawn Cemetery, Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania.

<text>Filippo Parlatore (Palermo, 8 August 1816 â Florence, 9 September 1877) was an Italian botanist.

He studied medicine at Palermo, but practiced only for a short time, his chief activity being during the cholera epidemic of 1837. Although at that time he had been an assistant professor of anatomy, a subject on which he had already written (Treatise on the human retina), he soon gave up all other interests to devote his entire attention to botany. He first made a study of the flora of Sicily, publishing in 1838 &quot;Flora panormitana&quot; (Palermo); he also dealt with the Sicilian flora in later works. In 1840 he left home to begin his extended botanical expeditions. He travelled all through Italy, then into Switzerland (where he remained for a time at Geneva with De Candolle), to France (where he was at Paris with Webb, the Englishman) and to England, his longest stay being at Kew. His part in the Third Congress of Italian naturalists held at Florence in 1841 was of significance for him and for the development of botanical studies in Italy. At this congress, in his celebrated memoir &quot;Sulla botanica in Italia&quot;, he proposed, among other things, that a general herbarium be established at Florence. This proposal was adopted. Grand Duke Leopold sought his assistance for this herbarium, gave him the post of professor of botany at the museum of natural sciences (a chair which had been vacant for almost thirty years), and made him director of the botanical garden connected with the museum. For more than three decades Parlatore was most active in fulfilling the duties of these positions, one of his principal services being the contribution of &quot;Collections botaniques du musÃ©e royale de physique et d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; (Florence, 1874) to the great collection entitled &quot;Erbario centrale italiano&quot;. His own private herbarium is now a part of the central herbarium, containing about 1900-2500 fascicules. In 1849 he made an investigation of the flora of the Mont-Blanc chain of the Alps; in 1851 he explored those of Northern Europe, Lapland, and Finland; the reports of these two expeditions appeared respectively in 1850 and 1854.

He published numerous treatises on botanical subjects,---discussing questions of system, organography, physiology, plant geography, and paleontology---in various periodicals, chiefly in the &quot;Giornale botanico Italiano&quot; (1844-), which he founded. He also gave considerable attention to the history of botany in Italy. His lifework in botany, however, is &quot;Flora Italiana&quot;, of which five volumes appeared between 1848 and 1874; the next five were issued by Teodoro Caruel (to 1894) with the assistance of Parlatore&#x27;s manuscript. This work stands in high repute among all botanists. Mention should also be made of &quot;Lezioni di botanica comparata&quot; (Florence, 1843) and &quot;Monographia delle fumarie&quot; (Florence, 1844). To the sixteenth volume of De Candolle&#x27;s &quot;Prodromus&quot;, Parlatore contributed the accounts of the conifers and Gnetaceae; to Webb&#x27;s &quot;Histoire naturelle des Ã®les Canaries&quot; (Paris, 1836â50), the accounts of the Umbelliferae and Graminae.

In 1842, Pierre Edmond Boissier named a genus of plants from Middle Asia as &quot;Parlatoria&quot; (part of the Brassicaceae family).

<doc id="1291949" wikidata="Q858325" url="?curid=1291949" title="Anti-aliasing filter">
<text>An anti-aliasing filter (AAF) is a filter used before a signal sampler to restrict the bandwidth of a signal to satisfy the NyquistâShannon sampling theorem over the band of interest. Since the theorem states that unambiguous reconstruction of the signal from its samples is possible when the power of frequencies above the Nyquist frequency is zero, a brick wall filter is an idealized but impractical AAF. A practical AAF makes a trade off between reduced bandwidth and increased aliasing. A practical anti-aliasing filter will typically permit some aliasing to occur or attenuate or otherwise distort some in-band frequencies close to the Nyquist limit. For this reason, many practical systems sample higher than would be theoretically required by a perfect AAF in order to ensure that all frequencies of interest can be reconstructed, a practice called oversampling.

== Optical applications ==


In the case of optical image sampling, as by image sensors in digital cameras, the anti-aliasing filter is also known as an optical low-pass filter (OLPF), blur filter, or AA filter. The mathematics of sampling in two spatial dimensions is similar to the mathematics of time-domain sampling, but the filter implementation technologies are different.

The typical implementation in digital cameras is two layers of birefringent material such as lithium niobate, which spreads each optical point into a cluster of four points. The choice of spot separation for such a filter involves a tradeoff among sharpness, aliasing, and fill factor (the ratio of the active refracting area of a microlens array to the total contiguous area occupied by the array). In a monochrome or three-CCD or Foveon X3 camera, the microlens array alone, if near 100% effective, can provide a significant anti-aliasing function,
while in color filter array (e.g. Bayer filter) cameras, an additional filter is generally needed to reduce aliasing to an acceptable level.

Alternative implementations include the Pentax K-3&#x27;s anti-aliasing filter, which applies small vibrations to the sensor element.

== Audio applications ==
Anti-aliasing filters are used at the input of an analog-to-digital converter. Similar filters are used as reconstruction filters at the output of a digital-to-analog converter. In the latter case, the filter prevents imaging, the reverse process of aliasing where in-band frequencies are mirrored out of band.

=== Oversampling ===

With oversampling, a higher intermediate digital sample rate is used, so that a nearly ideal digital filter can sharply cut off aliasing near the original low Nyquist frequency and give better phase response, while a much simpler analog filter can stop frequencies above the new higher Nyquist frequency. Because analog filters have relatively high cost and limited performance, relaxing the demands on the analog filter can greatly reduce both aliasing and cost. Furthermore, because some noise is averaged out, the higher sampling rate can moderately improve signal-to-noise ratio.

A signal may be intentionally sampled at a higher rate to reduce the requirements and distortion of the anti-alias filter. For example, compare CD audio with high-resolution audio. CD audio filters the signal to a passband edge of 20Â kHz, with a stopband Nyquist frequency of 22.05Â kHz and sample rate of 44.1Â kHz. The narrow 2.05Â kHz transition band requires a compromise between filter complexity and performance. High-resolution audio uses a higher sample rate, providing both a higher passband edge and larger transition band, which allows better filter performance with reduced aliasing, reduced attenuation of higher audio frequencies and reduced time and phase domain signal distortion. 

=== Bandpass signals ===

Often, an anti-aliasing filter is a low-pass filter; this is not a requirement, however. Generalizations of the NyquistâShannon sampling theorem allow sampling of other band-limited passband signals instead of baseband signals.

For signals that are bandwidth limited, but not centered at zero, a band-pass filter can be used as an anti-aliasing filter. For example, this could be done with a single-sideband modulated or frequency modulated signal. If one desired to sample an FM radio broadcast centered at 87.9Â MHz and bandlimited to a 200Â kHz band, then an appropriate anti-alias filter would be centered on 87.9Â MHz with 200Â kHz bandwidth (or passband of 87.8Â MHz to 88.0Â MHz), and the sampling rate would be no less than 400Â kHz, but should also satisfy other constraints to prevent aliasing.

=== Signal overload ===
It is very important to avoid input signal overload when using an anti-aliasing filter. If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the analog-to-digital converter, even after filtering. When distortion due to clipping occurs after the anti-aliasing filter, it can create components outside the passband of the anti-aliasing filter; these components can then alias, causing the reproduction of other non-harmonically related frequencies.

<text>Lachlan Keith Murdoch (; born 8 September 1971) is an American and Australian businessman and mass media heir. He is the son of the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. He is the executive chairman of Nova Entertainment, chairman of News Corp, executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation. In 2023, he was listed 33rd on the list of Australia&#x27;s wealthiest people, with his wealth estimated at billion (US$2.1 billion).

, the Murdoch family is involved in a court case in the US in which Lachlan&#x27;s brother James, his sister Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence are challenging their father&#x27;s bid to amend the family trust to ensure that Lachlan retains control of News Corp and Fox Corp.

== Early life and education ==
Murdoch was born on 8 September 1971 at Wimbledon Hospital in Wimbledon, London, the eldest son of Australian-born American media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and his second wife, Scottish journalist and author Anna Maria dePeyster (nÃ©e Torv; formerly Murdoch). He was raised in New York City, where his father owned the &quot;New York Post&quot;, after moving there with his family at the age of three.

He received his primary and secondary education at the Aspen Country Day School in Aspen, Colorado; then Dalton School and Trinity School in Manhattan, New York City; and then at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. 

In 1989 he took a gap year, during which he spent three months in Sydney, Australia, doing a menial job for the family business &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, while his father was in the city for business.

In 1994, he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Princeton University. While at Princeton, he studied philosophy with BÃ©atrice Longuenesse and Alan Hajek. His senior thesis was on German philosophy.

== Career ==
=== News Corp executive (1995â2005)===
At the age of 22 or 23, Murdoch was appointed general manager of Queensland Newspapers, the publisher of Brisbane&#x27;s &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;, and at this time became friends with James Packer, also the son of a media mogul. He became publisher of Australia&#x27;s first national paper, &quot;The Australian&quot;, and in 1995, was appointed deputy CEO of News Limited in Australia, and in 1996 was appointed to the News Corporation board. After getting married in 1999, he was in 2000 appointed deputy chief operating officer of News Corp&#x27;s global print operations, promoted from his previous roles as executive director of News Corp (1996), and senior executive vice-president (1999â2000).

With a personal interest in Australian rugby league, on 30 March 1995 Murdoch was at the first Super League meeting in the Atanaskovic Hartnell offices in Sydney. He and former Brisbane Broncos chief John Ribot signed up leading Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs players on documents which were not legally effective. Murdoch was the Broncos&#x27; number one ticket holder. This venture lost money

Encouraged to invest in One.Tel by his friend Australian businessman James Packer, the son of television network owner Kerry Packer, Murdoch was extensively criticised for encouraging News Corporation&#x27;s multi-hundred million-dollar investment in the start-up telecommunications company in the late 1990s. In April 2014, Murdoch and Packer agreed to an 40Â million settlement over the failure of One.Tel. The settlement was approved by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 17 April 2014, with 14.93Â million to be paid by the Packer family&#x27;s Consolidated Press Holdings, 11.77Â million to be paid by Packer&#x27;s Crown Resorts and 13.3Â million to be paid by News Corp. During this time, Murdoch and his wife lived near his father in New York, and socialised with glamorous people, including expats Baz Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman.

Murdoch led an initial $10.75Â million investment, of which only $2.25Â million was in cash, in REA Group, and subsequently championed the retention of the investment over the objections of those who wished to sell it. The company later emerged as Australia&#x27;s market leader in online real estate advertising, known as Realestate.com.au, and in 2014 was assessed as worth more than $3.6Â billion to News Corp.

For the year 2001, Murdoch earned a salary of 2.59Â million. During his time at News Corp, Murdoch had oversight of HarperCollins and the company&#x27;s lines of business in Australia, including REA. He also served on the board of Foxtel and as chairman of Fox Television stations, and was the publisher of the &quot;New York Post&quot;. While at the &quot;New York Post&quot;, its circulation grew by over 40 per cent. 

In July 2005, the 33-year-old Murdoch abruptly resigned as an executive at the News Corp after a clash with then Fox News head Roger Ailes, with whom his father had sided, and returned to Australia with his wife and son. At the time, aged 34, he was the third most powerful executive in the company. The media empire then included the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, and included the Fox television network, several satellite broadcasters, and newspapers in the UK, US, and Australia. Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News Channel, was named chairman of News Corp&#x27;s group of television stations to succeed Murdoch junior. Media speculated that his brother, James Murdoch, then chief executive of UK satellite TV company BSkyB, may succeed Rupert Murdoch. 

=== Private investments (2005â2014) ===
On leaving News Corp with a two-year non-compete agreement, Murdoch founded an Australian private investment company, Illyria Pty Ltd, in 2005. He developed an eclectic mix of investments, with stakes in the Indian Premier League cricket team Rajasthan Royals, online DVD rental company Quickflix, toy marketer Funtastic and digital media company Destra. On 21 January 2008, Murdoch and James Packer announced that their companies, Illyria and Consolidated Press Holdings would seek to privatise the publicly-listed Consolidated Media Holdings. It was expected that the proposed 3.3Â billion deal would deliver Murdoch and Packer with private stakes in Foxtel, Fox Sports, Universal Media Firm, LLC and PBL Media, with the latter owning the Nine Network and ACP Magazines. Packer eventually decided to sell down his stake in media companies in a series of transactions between 2006 and 2008, and the deal with Murdoch collapsed.

In November 2009, Illyria acquired 50% of a network of radio stations called DMG Radio, which was renamed Nova Entertainment, with Murdoch as chairman. In September 2012 Illyria acquired the balance of shares it did not own. In 2012, Illyria purchased the remaining 50% of the holdings, and within a few years, NOVA Entertainment grew into the leading network of FM stations in Australia. 

In 2010, Packer purchased an 18% stake in Network Ten, quickly offloading half to Murdoch. Both Packer and Murdoch joined the Ten board. In February 2011, Murdoch was appointed acting CEO of Ten Network Holdings after the company&#x27;s board terminated the contract of CEO Grant Blackley. The following month Packer unexpectedly resigned from the board. In February 2012, the Ten board appointed Murdoch non-executive chairman of Ten Network Holdings. Although Ten was already in some financial difficulties before Murdoch became CEO, by late 2012, on paper Illyria had lost 110Â million of the original 150Â million invested since 2010. The share price had fallen by about 80% and network profits had dropped by over half. In an attempt to control costs, Ten had reduced employment numbers by 160 people, and the problems were mainly attributed to falling advertising revenues and restructuring at the network. Ten purchased, at three times its original cost, the Australian rights for &quot;MasterChef&quot; from the Australian subsidiary of the Shine Group, itself a subsidiary of the News Corpowned 21st Century Fox. On 14 June 2017, Ten went into voluntary administration after Murdoch and fellow shareholder Bruce Gordon declined to extend the company&#x27;s credit facility. Two bids were received for Ten; one from Murdoch and Gordon and one from CBS Corporation â Ten&#x27;s largest creditor. The CBS bid was preferred by both the administrators and creditors. CBS&#x27;s successful bid meant Murdoch lost his entire investment in the network.

=== Return to News Corp (2014)===
In March 2014, Murdoch was appointed as non-executive co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox (one of two companies formed in June 2013 from the old News Corp) in a move that was seen as succession planning for the media empire. This was in the wake of the phone hacking scandal in the UK and his father&#x27;s divorce from Wendi Deng.

Murdoch stood aside as chairman and a director of Ten Network Holdings at this time. 

In June 2015 he was named as executive chairman of 21st Century Fox. 

After 21st Century Fox was acquired by Disney in March 2019, Murdoch was named as the chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation, and was named by his father as heir to his business interests. His father was still hoping &quot;to continue an active role in the company&quot;. Former president Donald Trump met him in 2019.

In 2022, he and his father wanted to merge News Corp and Fox Corp, but his brother James&#x27; opposition, along with that of major shareholders, sunk the proposition the following year.
===Successor to his father (2023)===
In September 2023, at the age of 52, when Rupert Murdoch retired, Lachlan Murdoch took over the leadership of his father&#x27;s group, becoming chair of both Fox Corp and News Corp. In 2023, &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot; placed Lachlan Murdoch 33rd on their list of Australia&#x27;s wealthiest people, with his wealth estimated at billion (US$2.1 billion).

In a July 2024 interview with Paul Kelly of &quot;The Australian&quot;, Murdoch said:

 Murdoch is executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation, as well as chair of News Corp and executive chairman of Nova Entertainment, an Australian company.

==Other activities==
In 2002, Murdoch gave the Andrew Olle Media Lecture.

Murdoch is one of the founding patrons (along with Anthony Pratt, Peter Lowy, and Lisa Fox) of an organisation called &quot;Advance&quot;, formerly known as the Young Australian Professionals in America. They held a benefit dinner in November 2005.

== Lawsuits ==
=== Dominion lawsuit (2021â2023)===

In 2021, Lachlan Murdoch and his father Rupert were the defendants in a $1.6 billion lawsuit, filed by voting machine maker Dominion Voting Systems, for knowingly and maliciously spreading false accusations that Dominion committed election fraud. Fox News Corporation requested that the case be dismissed and on 16 December 2021, the court rejected the request, with the opinion that &quot;Dominion adequately pleaded actual malice by Fox News&quot;. 

On 6 June 2022, Fox News Corp requested Judge Eric M. Davis drop the lawsuit. In his opinion, Judge Davis denied the request, saying that Dominion had shown enough evidence of actual malice on behalf of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch of Fox Corporation to allow the case to continue. Documentation obtained by Dominion showed that Lachlan had played &quot;a hands-on role in determining the political thrust of Fox News in favour of Trump&quot;. In the end, Fox had to pay $787.5 million in damages in April 2023, and Tucker Carlson was dismissed on 24 April 2023. 

=== &quot;Crikey&quot; (2022â2023)===
Murdoch sent a series of legal threats to &quot;Crikey&quot;, an Australian electronic magazine, after political editor Bernard Keane tied the Murdochs to the January 6 United States Capitol attack in a 29 June 2022 article. Crikey originally removed the article to avoid legal persecution but later republished it, with editor Peter Fray accusing Murdoch of &quot;using the law to silence public debate&quot;, and &quot;seeking to intimidate us&quot;.

On 21 April 2023, Murdoch&#x27;s lawyers filed a notice to discontinue the case. Murdoch had to pay more than in legal fees to Private Media after abandoning the case. 

=== Smartmatic (2022â)===
In a lawsuit similar to Dominion&#x27;s, voting machine maker Smartmatic filed a lawsuit implicating both Lachlan Murdoch and his father Rupert for US$2.7Â billion on 4 February 2021. Smartmatic claims &quot;Fox News engaged in conspiracy to spread disinformation about Smartmatic. They lied, and did so knowingly and intentionally.&quot; In March 2022, Justice David Cohen allowed the removal of several hosts as co-defendants but rejected Fox&#x27;s motion for dismissal of the suit allowing it to go to the discovery phase. In a second attempt from Fox News to dismiss the lawsuit, Justice Cohen again rejected Fox&#x27;s request and gave the opinion that Smartmatic had showed a &quot;substantial basis&quot; for their claim that Fox News &quot;showed a reckless disregard for the truth&quot;.

, the case continues. In July 2024, Smartmatic subpoenaed four Fox Corporation board members.

===Family challenge (2024â)===

In September 2024, the Murdoch family is involved in a court case in Reno, Nevada, in which three of Lachlan&#x27;s siblings (James, his sister Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence MacLeod) are challenging their father&#x27;s bid to amend the family trust to ensure that Lachlan retains control of News Corp and Fox Corp, rather than benefiting all of his six children, as is specified in the &quot;irrevocable&quot; terms of the trust. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Murdoch Snr wants his companies to remain politically conservative, and sees his other children as too politically liberal. 

The irrevocable family trust was set up after Rupert and Anna Murdoch&#x27;s divorce in 1999, to hold the family&#x27;s 28.5% stake in News Corp. It relates only to the children born before then, giving them equal say in the fate of the businesses: each would have one vote in the trust, while their father would have four. Almost all of the family&#x27;s wealth is in shares controlling 40% of both News Corp and Fox Corp, and is tied up in the trust, which is worth around $US6 billion. The terms of the trust dictate that the four children would continue to have these votes after Rupert&#x27;s death. Chloe and Grace Murdoch, Rupert&#x27;s children with third wife Wendi Deng, will have no say in the business, although will share the stock proceeds. The case follows Rupert&#x27;s attempt to change the trust in October 2023 (which he dubbed &quot;Project Harmony&quot;), revealed to his offspring in December of that year, and the Nevada probate commissioner&#x27;s finding that he was allowed to amend the trust &quot;if he is able to show he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs&quot;. According to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in September 2024, James had made an attempt at settlement, in a proposal that included the possible sale of his and his sisters&#x27; interests in the trust. However, this would lead to a loosening of the hold of Lachlan and Rupert on the companies, as they would be under financial strain. Rupert&#x27;s argument in the court is that interference by the other siblings would cause a financial loss to Fox, and therefore &quot;in their own best interests if they have their votes taken away from them&quot;. He argues that preserving the outlet&#x27;s conservative editorial stance against interference by the more politically moderate siblings would better protect its commercial value. The court proceedings are being held in secret, although some details surround the case have leaked out.

The case has led to the three children becoming estranged from their father, with none of them attending his wedding to his fifth wife, Elena Zhukova, in June 2024.

== Personal life ==
Apart from full siblings Elisabeth and James Murdoch, Lachlan has three half-siblings, an elder half-sister Prudence, and two younger sisters by his father&#x27;s third marriage, Grace and Chloe. In later years, tensions between the two brothers have been reported. 

He holds Australian citizenship, has often stated that he sees himself as Australian and his home is in Australia. Like his brother James, as he was born in the UK before 1983, he is likely automatically a British citizen otherwise than by descent as well, though he may not have opted to exercise that citizenship. He does not have as strong ties to the UK as his father and siblings, not having spent a lot of time there. Having lived and worked for extended periods in the US and acquired an American accent, it is often assumed that he is American, but he said in a 2001 interview that he considers himself Australian and wishes he could lose the accent.

Murdoch married British-born Australian model/actress Sarah O&#x27;Hare in 1999. The couple have two sons; and one daughter.

The Murdochs owned &quot;Berthong&quot;, a house in , Sydney, until it was sold to Russell Crowe in 2003. In November 2009, Murdoch purchased &quot;Le Manoir&quot;, a mansion in Bellevue Hill for $23Â million; and purchased an adjoining property two years later. In 2017, Murdoch and his wife paid 29Â million for a large equestrian property in Aspen, Colorado, that contains a six-bedroom home. In 2019, they purchased the Chartwell Estate in Los Angeles for an estimated 150Â million.

 Murdoch owns homes in Sydney, Aspen, and Los Angeles. His wife and children have lived in Sydney since 2021, and Lachlan splits his time between there, Los Angeles (location of Fox Corp. HQ), and New York City, where News Corp is headquartered. He speaks with an American accent but considers Australia to be his home.
===Political views===
Although it has been assumed that Lachlan is more conservative than his siblings, it was reported that he did not support Trump&#x27;s presidency, and kept toilet paper printed with his face in his house during the 2016 campaign. However, he has backed his father&#x27;s moves in business, including defending Tucker Carlson when he was on the rise. 

In 2018, Lachlan described his political views as &quot;conservative economically and more liberal on social policy&quot;.

In February 2023, Lachlan and his wife Sarah Murdoch gave A$1 million to a queer museum in Sydney called Qtopia.
=== Ancestry ===
==Recognition and in the media==
In June 2005, Murdoch received the Press &amp; Outdoor Advertising &quot;media person of the year&quot; award in Cannes.

In September 2024, ABC Television (Australia) aired a three-part documentary for their &quot;Australian Story&quot; program entitled: &quot;Making Lachlan Murdoch&quot;. Murdoch did not participate in its production, which was made by journalist Paddy Manning and introduced by veteran ABC journalist Leigh Sales, but it does feature a 2001 interview with him, and his billionaire friend James Packer is interviewed. The style of the documentary has no voice-overs, allowing the people featured to talk in their own voices.

The opening episode, &quot;Blood&quot; focuses on his father, Rupert, and grandfather Sir Keith Murdoch. The second episode is called &quot;Money&quot;. The series is also aired on YouTube.

He is a professor and the Vice Chair of the Design Media Arts department at UCLA, director of the Institute for Technology and Aesthetics (ITA), and founder of &quot;mediawork&quot;: The Southern California New Media Group.

Lunenfeld is a leading figure in digital aesthetic theory, set on establishing philosophical quandaries regarding digital technology and its role in art, design and culture. Works like &quot;Snap to Grid&quot; and &quot;The Secret War Between Downloading and Uploading&quot; incorporate traditional and continental theories of art to account for digital media. His work revolves around the discourses of technology, aesthetics, and cultural theory, establishing the complexity of digital aesthetics while simultaneously categorizing it.

His books include &quot;City at the Edge of Forever&quot;, &quot;Digital_Humanities&quot;, &quot;USER&quot;, &quot;Snap to Grid&quot;, and &quot;The Digital Dialectic&quot;. Lunenfeld is the editorial director of the highly designed Mediawork pamphlet series for the MIT Press. The series features commissioned writings that weave life stories into &quot;theoretical and critical praxis.&quot; These award-winning &quot;theoretical fetish objects&quot; cover the intersections of art, design, technology, and market culture. Included in the series is &quot;Utopian Entrepreneur&quot; (2001) by Brenda Laurel, designed by Denise Gonzales Crisp; &quot;Writing Machines&quot; (2002) by N. Katherine Hayles, designed by Anne Burdick; &quot;Rhythm Science&quot; (2004) by Paul D. Miller aka DJ Spooky that Subliminal Kid, designed by COMA; and, &quot;Shaping Things&quot; (2005) by Bruce Sterling, designed by Lorraine Wild. Lev Manovich, the author of &quot;The Language of New Media&quot;, lauded these 100 page &quot;mind bombs&quot; in the tradition of McLuhan and FioreÂ¹s &quot;The Medium is the Massage&quot; as a new operating system for the book.

Lunenfeld has a B.A. in history from Columbia University, an MA in Media Studies from SUNY Buffalo, and a Ph.D. from UCLA in Film &amp; Television. He worked as the Applications Coordinator at the Academy Award winning hardware and software company Lyon Lamb.

<doc id="1291973" wikidata="Q699784" url="?curid=1291973" title="1953 West German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in West Germany on 6 September 1953 to elect the members of the second Bundestag. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) emerged as the largest party.

This elections were the last before Saarland joined West Germany in 1957. It had been a separate entity, Saar protectorate, under French control since 1946.

The CDU/CSU formed a center-right coalition government with the FDP, DP and GB/BHE, leaving the SPD as the main opposition. In comparison to the 1949 election where ten parties won seats, only six parties won seats in the 1953 election, thus entailing a consolidation of the party system.

==Campaign==
Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (who was also CDU leader) campaigned on his policies of economic reconstruction and growth, moderate conservatism or Christian democracy, and close relations with the United States. During the campaign he attacked the Social Democratic Party (SPD) ferociously. His staff had a comfortable coach on a train previously used only by Hermann GÃ¶ring and behind that a dining car with sleeping berths for journalists. The new SPD leader (Kurt Schumacher had died in 1952) was Erich Ollenhauer, who was more moderate in his policies than Schumacher had been. He did not oppose, in principle, the United States&#x27; military presence in Western Europe. He later â in 1957 â supported a military alliance of most European countries, including Germany. On 3 September American Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said that &quot;A defeat for Adenauer would have catastrophic consequences for the prospects for German reunification and the restoration of sovereignty&quot; and that it would &quot;trigger off such confusion in Germany that further delays in German efforts for reunification and freedom would be unavoidable.&quot; Adenauer managed to convince clearly more West German voters of his leadership abilities and economic and political success to easily win a second term, although he had to form a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party and the conservative German Party to gain a majority in the Bundestag.

==Results==
===Results by state===
==== Constituency seats ====

==== List seats ====
== Aftermath ==
Konrad Adenauer remained Chancellor, governing in a broad coalition (two-thirds majority) with most of the minor parties except for the SPD and Centre Party.

<doc id="1291976" wikidata="Q235744" url="?curid=1291976" title="Jean Hagen">
<text>Jean Hagen (born Jean Shirley Verhagen; August 3, 1923 â August 29, 1977) was an American actress best known for her role as Doll Conovan in &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950) and as Lina Lamont in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Hagen was also nominated three times for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Margaret Williams on the first three seasons (1953â56) of the television series &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; (when titled as &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;).

==Early life==
Hagen was born August 3, 1923, in Chicago, to Christian Verhagen, a Dutch immigrant, and Marie, his Chicago-born wife. The family moved to Elkhart, Indiana, when she was 12, and she graduated from Elkhart High School. She studied drama at Northwestern University, where she was a roommate of actress Patricia Neal. She graduated from Northwestern in 1945. She also worked as an usher.

==Career==
===Radio===
Hagen began her show-business career in radio in the 1940s performing in &quot;Light of the World&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Story&quot;, and other programs. Using her birth name (Jean Verhagen), she played Betty Webster on &quot;Those Websters&quot;.

===Stage===
Hagen first appeared on Broadway in &quot;Swan Song&quot;. She acted in &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, and &quot;The Traitor&quot;.

===Film and television===
Her film debut was as a comical femme fatale in the 1949 Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn film &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;, directed by George Cukor. &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950) provided Hagen with her first starring role. Hagen played Doll Conover, a woman who sticks by criminal Dix&#x27;s side until the bitter end. She appeared in the film noir &quot;Side Street&quot; (1950), playing a gangster&#x27;s sincere but dim girlfriend. Hagen gave a memorable comic performance in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; as the vain, spoiled, and talentless silent film star Lina Lamont. She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.
By 1953, she had joined the cast of the television sitcom &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;. After she left the show, Marjorie Lord was cast as Danny&#x27;s second wife and played opposite Thomas for the remainder of the series.

In 1957, Hagen co-starred in an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; titled &quot;Enough Rope for Two&quot;, portraying a woman who accompanies two thieves trying to retrieve stolen money from a desert mine shaft. She then appeared as Elizabeth in the 1960 episode &quot;Once Upon a Knight&quot; on &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;; Also in 1960, Hagen was Marie Brandt on &quot;Wagon Train&quot; in the episode &quot;The Marie Brandt Story&quot;; and in 1963 Hagen portrayed Sarah Proctor on Wagon Train in the episode âThe Sarah Proctor Storyâ. The following year, she guest-starred on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; in the episode &quot;Andy and the Woman Speeder&quot;.

Although she made frequent guest appearances in television series, Hagen was unable to resume her film career in starring roles. Her health began to decline due to an alcohol problem and she spent many years hospitalized or under medical care in the 1960s. After appearing with Fred MacMurray in the Disney comedy &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959), for the remainder of her career she played supporting roles, such as Marguerite LeHand, personal secretary to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in &quot;Sunrise at Campobello &quot;(1960) and the friend of Bette Davis in &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; (1964).

Much later, in 1976, she made a comeback of sorts playing character roles in episodes of the television series &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. She made her final acting appearance the next year in the television movie &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jean Hagen married actor Tom Seidel (who originated the role of Dr. Sanderson in the play &quot;Harvey&quot;) on June 12, 1947, in Brentwood, California. The couple had two children, Christine Patricia and Aric Phillip. According to Lorraine LoBianco&#x27;s authoritative biography, Seidel, in his attempt to stop his wife from drinking, divorced her and gained custody of the children. It did not work; Hagen&#x27;s alcoholism only worsened, finally becoming so severe by 1968 that she was hospitalized and lapsed into a coma at UCLA Medical Center. She managed to survive the ordeal, and her daughter, Christine, said that after she emerged from the coma, Hagen never drank again.

Unfortunately, another health problem arose: throat cancer. Patricia Neal wrote in her autobiography that Hagen went to Germany &quot;&#x27;for laetrile, a supposed cure unavailable in the United States. But she was bubbly and bright and so much the way I remembered her from the old days.&#x27;&quot;

==Death==
Hagen died, twenty-six days after her 54th birthday, of esophageal cancer on August 29, 1977, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital.

==Honors==
Hagen was nominated for a 1956 Emmy Award in the &quot;Best actress (continuing performance)&quot; category. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1502 Vine Street for her contributions to television.

<doc id="1291986" wikidata="Q312315" url="?curid=1291986" title="Astyanax (fish)">
<text>Astyanax is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Characidae of the order Characiformes. Some of these fish, like many of their relatives, are kept as aquarium pets and known collectively as tetras. With around 150 described species and new ones being described yearly, this genus is among the largest of the entire order; &quot;Hyphessobrycon&quot; also has more than 145 species and which one is larger at any one time depends on whether more species have been recently described in one or the other. The blind and colorless cave tetra of Mexico is a famous member of the genus, but its taxonomic position is disputed: Some recognize it as part of the Mexican tetra (&quot;A. mexicanus&quot;) and this is supported by phylogenetic evidence, but others recognize the cave form as a separate species, &quot;A. jordani&quot;.

The type species is &quot;A. argentatus&quot;, now regarded as a form of the Mexican tetra (&quot;A. mexicanus&quot;). The generic name comes from Astyanax, a character in Greek mythology, who was the son of Hector of Troy; in homage to this, several specific epithets also refer to the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
This genus is more or less defined as in 1917 by Carl H. Eigenmann. The lack of comprehensive phylogenetic analyses dealing with this genus is hindering a thorough review and the relationships remain as indeterminate as the monophyly is doubtful. The results of 2020 study using a combination of molecular and morphological data appeared to confirm that &quot;Astyanax&quot; is not monophyletic and suggested the creation of two new genera and the resurrection of &quot;Psalidodon&quot;.
Although included in &quot;Astyanax&quot; by FishBase, phylogenetic evidence supports moving &quot;A. aurocaudatus&quot; back to the monotypic genus &quot;Carlastyanax&quot;.

==Species==



There are currently 132 recognized species in this genus:

<doc id="1291989" wikidata="Q6942221" url="?curid=1291989" title="Music of North Dakota">
<text>The Music of North Dakota has followed general American trends over much of its history, beginning with ragtime and folk music, moving into big band and jazz. With the development of mass media, local artists in North Dakota, as in the rest of the country, saw a rapid loss of opportunity to create, perform, and sell popular music to the regional audience that had previously provided a market. Punk Music is a major genre in the modern youth scene of North Dakota.

==Indigenous music==
==Ethnic music==
One aspect of music that has been around for over a century is the &quot;old-time&quot; music, still played, danced to, and sung in parts of North Dakota. Such music is typified by fast waltzes, polkas, schottisches, two-steps, and the butterfly.

==Popular music==
Presently, North Dakota has a number of active indie acts and pop music.
The most active music scenes for local artists in popular styles are in Fargo, Minot, Grand Forks, Bismarck, and Williston, while Dickinson and Devils Lake are active to a lesser extent. Most shows are booked by independent promoters who find space for shows wherever available, though occasionally groups like the AMP have provided permanent venues for musical acts. A lot of bands that were popular in the 80s like playing in North Dakota to the old folk. Country music acts like to play more often in ND.

===Touring acts===
Smaller musical groups passing through North Dakota often play at the independently promoted shows in the state&#x27;s larger cities alongside local acts.

Medium-sized groups may be headlined in events thrown by financially interested promoters, such as the Hub&#x27;s Venue (formally Playmaker&#x27;s Pavilion) in Fargo.

Large touring acts crossing North Dakota often use the state&#x27;s larger event venues such as the Alerus Center (Grand Forks), Fargodome (Fargo), and Bismarck Civic Center (Bismarck), to draw large arena rock crowds. National acts in a variety of styles are also often booked for the North Dakota State Fair (Minot), though the fair does tend to have more country groups in keeping with the fair&#x27;s rural focus.

==Classical music==
In addition to popular music, classical music and jazz are common across the state. Independent jazz bands are rare, but there are many school programs for music. The International Music Camp is also located on the border between North Dakota and Manitoba.

Many of North Dakota&#x27;s universities have great music programs; the choir program at Jamestown College and the instrumental music programs at the University of Mary and the University of North Dakota are particularly notable.

Concert orchestras operate in Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot. Of these, the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra is the largest, while the Greater Grand Forks Symphony Orchestra is the oldest.

Many opera groups exist in the state. Two of the larger ones include the Fargo-Moorhead Opera Company and The Western Plains Opera Company of Minot, each of which stage two-three performances a season.

Choral music organizations include the Grand Forks Master Chorale, the Fargo Chamber Chorale, and the Nodakords, Heritage Singers, and Voices of Note, all of Minot.

International Music Camp, a summer camp providing intensive instruction in music and fine arts, is held each summer at the International Peace Garden.

==Modern history==
Since the late 20th century, North Dakota has seen a number of active musical scenes.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a small but thriving new wave/power pop scene based in Fargo. Groups like &quot;Johnny Holm&quot;, &quot;The Unbelievable Uglies&quot;, &quot;The Newz&quot;, &quot;Clown&quot;, &quot;Brittania&quot;, &quot;Nitro Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Phones&quot; and &quot;The Metro All-Stars&quot; were the premier bands. These bands played extensively throughout the upper Midwest, benefitting from a short-lived surge in bars that booked rock and roll bands during the early 80s. For example, in Jamestown, North Dakota, there was one bar and a &quot;teen canteen&quot; that booked rock and roll bands in 1978, but by 1984, there were five such venues. Bismarck, also had several venues for local bands such as &quot;The Champ Band&quot;, &quot;Cypress&quot; and &quot;Nightlife&quot; to perform in. In Fargo/Moorhead, you could hear a live band 7 nights a week with music clubs including The Lamplight, The Sunset Lanes, The Zodiac, The Gaslight, The 4-10 Lounge, Jerry&#x27;s and Kirby&#x27;s. These venues would draw bands from all over The Midwest where they could perform 5-6 nights a week. Some of the venues had music 7 nights a week. This pattern was briefly replicated in many similar cities in the region. This led several regional bands to write original music and even record albums, some of which sold respectably by regional standards. The scene was also lucrative enough to allow many bands from the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota area to play throughout North Dakota.

As the 1980s progressed and a farm crisis hurt the state&#x27;s economy, new drinking and driving laws, plus bar insurance laws were passed, the nightclub and bar scene began to struggle. In 1980, The Good Music Agency (GMA) relocated nearly all of their Fargo/Moorhead bands to Minneapolis which had a very hot music scene at the time. Thus, the local music scene shrank and a number of bars and clubs that had booked music ceased to do so. For example, the five Jamestown bars that had booked bands back in 1984 were all closed or no longer booking in 1989. By mid-decade, most of the leading bands had disbanded. &quot;Silver&quot;, after purchasing the rights to the &quot;Uglies&quot; name, had decamped to Minneapolis, Minnesota and become &quot;The Metro Allstars&quot; (later: &quot;The Metros&quot;), &quot;Brittania&quot; and &quot;The Newz&quot; performed all over the Midwest. As the thriving Twin Cities music scene of the mid-1980s dissipated so to did the Fargo music scene fade.

Many homegrown bands spawned in the wake of this brief renaissance. Some bands tried to emulate bands from bigger markets by mixing originals in among the hours of cover songs. Most earned a living playing the hits of the day instead of original music.

Heavy metal bands were also popular in the 1980s. Chuck Klosterman wrote a tongue-in-cheek book on his experiences in the rock scene in North Dakota in the book &quot;Fargo Rock City&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
In the late 90s and early 00s, Fargo retained a small but active metal scene as well as a growing noise rock scene centered around bands like Morast, Godhead Silo, Hammerhead and Animal Lover.

In the mid to late 2010s, Fargo became recognized as a growing hub for experimental, industrial and noise music. Although noise had a smaller presence since the 90s with acts like Edwin Manchester and Unconditional Loathing, noise proliferated under the organization of musician Brandon Wald who would attend punk shows and hand out copies of zines on the history of industrial music. Throughout the decade, Wald would perform under the names of Monowolf and Support Unit while also running the Black Ring Rituals FM radio show and Black Ring Rituals Records label. In 2018, artist Trinity Hall began Doughgirl Tapes, a cassette label dedicated to pressing noise and experimental releases. The scene is noted for its heavy queer presence as well as its radical politics, with artists often covering themes related to violence against LGBT people, far-left politics, police brutality as well as local North Dakota issues related to environmental degradation and the Dakota Access Pipeline. Fargo has also hosted the biennial Fargo Noise Fest since 2016, though the event was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
