<text>Gilberto Aparecido da Silva (; born 7 October 1976) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder, most notably for Brazilian side Atlético Mineiro and for English Premier League club Arsenal, as well as for the Brazil national team. He currently serves as an ambassador for both Arsenal and FIFA. 

Born and raised in poverty in the Brazilian municipality of Lagoa da Prata, Gilberto joined the youth academy at local club América Mineiro, where he made his senior debut as a centre-back in 1998. After starring the following season, where he helped gain the club promotion into the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, he joined city rivals Atlético Mineiro. During his time at Atlético, Gilberto transitioned into a defensive midfielder under head coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, and flourished in his new role, gaining a call-up to the Brazil national team for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he featured prominently as his country won the tournament.

As a result of his World Cup performances, Gilberto garnered a move to the Premier League to sign for Arsenal that summer for a fee of £4.5 million. During his six years at Arsenal, Gilberto gained a reputation as a world class defensive midfielder, and starred in a midfield duo alongside Patrick Vieira. He would feature as a member of the &quot;Invincibles&quot;, where he captured his first top-flight league title as his team went undefeated the whole season, as well as winning two FA Cups. Gilberto also holds distinct records at Arsenal, recording their first goal at the Emirates Stadium, as well as their fastest ever goal, scoring in 21 seconds from kickoff against PSV Eindhoven in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. After departing Arsenal, Gilberto relocated to Greece, playing for Panathinaikos, where he won a domestic double. He then returned to Brazil in 2011, signing for Grêmio, where he remained for two years, before returning to Atlético to win the 2013 Copa Libertadores prior to retiring.

Gilberto featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing Brazil over a period of 9 years. He enjoyed a period of sustained success with his country, as he featured prominently in their victorious campaign at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, as well as being a core component as the team also won the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, while also featuring as captain in their Copa América win in 2007. After retaining the Confederations Cup in 2009, Gilberto expressed his desire to prolong his club career, which coincided with limited playing time for Brazil. He retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having made 93 appearances for Brazil.

==Early life==
As a child, Gilberto lived in the city of Lagoa da Prata with his father (a blacksmith), his mother (a housewife) and three sisters. His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the district of Usina Luciânia. Despite financial hardship, causing his sisters and him to share a single room, he had a relatively carefree childhood: he describes it as &quot;[a time when] I had no responsibility in my life, I played football on the street with cousins and friends, and we never had any contact with drugs or violence&quot;. In 1988 (aged 12), he got the chance to break out of poverty by playing football, joining América Mineiro as a youth player. It was during these years at América Mineiro that Gilberto was taught defensive discipline by playing as a central defender. When not playing football, Gilberto was taught furniture-making skills by his father, which he would come to use in the following years. In 1991, Gilberto&#x27;s father retired leaving the 16-year-old to provide financially for his whole family, a task made more difficult by his mother&#x27;s ill-health.

Because of the low wage at América Mineiro, he was forced to quit football to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would be the end of his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates.

==Club career==

===Early career===
In 1997, Gilberto&#x27;s friends convinced him to give football another try, which led to him re-signing for América Mineiro in 1997, this time as a full-time professional. Aged 22, Gilberto played as a central defender for the first team. During his first season for América Mineiro he was regarded as a key player by the club, despite being criticised by some fans for inconsistency. He helped them win the Série B division, and consequently gain promotion to Série A.

During Gilberto&#x27;s third season at América Mineiro, with the team back to Série B after relegation in Série A in 1999, he scored three goals, helping the club reach the second stage where they were eliminated by Vila Nova in the quarterfinals. In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club Atlético Mineiro. In his first season for the club, he fractured his right tibia and, as a result, missed a number of games. In his second season, he was moved by the manager Carlos Alberto Parreira from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became a revelation in Brazilian club football.

===Arsenal===
Gilberto&#x27;s performance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup caught the attention of many coaches. Gilberto expressed a desire to move to England, saying, &quot;It would be fantastic to play against the likes of David Beckham again.&quot; As a result, FA Premier League clubs Aston Villa and Arsenal led the chase to sign him. In August, while still under contract to Atlético Mineiro, Gilberto joined Arsenal on their pre-season tour of Austria; while he had not yet signed for Arsenal the deal looked set to go ahead. However, complications arose when a transfer embargo was placed on Atlético Mineiro due to unpaid wages to some players at the club, including Gilberto. There was also an issue of obtaining a UK work permit for Gilberto. Despite the complications, Gilberto ended a summer of speculation and joined Arsenal on 7 August 2002 for a fee of £4.5 million. Upon signing Gilberto, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said, &quot;What I like was the fact that he kept things simple. He can play all across the midfield but the holding role just in front of the defence is what he does best.&quot;
When Gilberto moved to England and began training with Arsenal, he bought a house in St Albans, South Hertfordshire. Having been used to life in small Brazilian towns, he initially struggled to adapt to the new way of life in London. However, on the pitch, he settled in very quickly. On 11 August 2002 he made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Liverpool in the second half of the FA Community Shield game in which he scored the winning goal. As the 2002–03 FA Premier League season began, Gilberto faced stiff competition for a place in midfield from compatriot Edu. After two substitute appearances, Gilberto finally broke into the starting eleven on 27 August, helping Arsenal to a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion. Gilberto&#x27;s good form continued as he set a new record for the fastest goal scored in the UEFA Champions League, scoring after 20.07 seconds against PSV on 25 September 2002.

2003–04 was an even better season for Gilberto, as he was instrumental in helping Arsenal win the Premier League title whilst going the entire season unbeaten. He played in 32 of Arsenal&#x27;s 38 unbeaten Premier League games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal&#x27;s 3–1 Community Shield win over Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at Bolton Wanderers on 27 September 2004, a scan revealed he had fractured his back. At first it was reported that he would be out of action for a month. Later reports suggested the injury could be season-threatening.

Gilberto&#x27;s doctor ordered him to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the fractured bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil for the duration of his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal&#x27;s 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal&#x27;s slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him.

In June 2005, football agent Jacques Lichtenstein took Atlético Mineiro to court over Gilberto&#x27;s transfer in 2002. Lichtenstein&#x27;s lawyer argued that he and his informal partner, Ronny Rosenthal, never received an allegedly agreed 10% commission from Gilberto&#x27;s £4.5 million transfer to Arsenal from Atlético Mineiro in July 2002. Arsène Wenger and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein both gave evidence in court, saying that Arsenal dealt directly with Atlético Mineiro and that no agent was involved in the deal. The case was conducted before The Hon. Mr Justice Jack, who on 29 June ruled against Lichtenstein, and ordered the claimants pay Atletico Minéiro £94,000 in legal costs. A year later, the case could have caused problems for Arsenal, when former player Ashley Cole criticised the club for &quot;hypocrisy and double standards&quot; in the way they approached Gilberto.
With legal matters subsided, the 2005–06 season began. Following midfielder and team captain Patrick Vieira&#x27;s departure from Arsenal, Gilberto became a senior member of the Arsenal team. Shortly into the season, in September 2005, his desire to see his career out with the club led to Gilberto extending his Arsenal contract to June 2009. A month later this loyalty was repaid when, on 18 October 2005, Gilberto made his first appearance for Arsenal as captain, against Sparta Prague. Although Gilberto had a period of bad form during the winter months of the season, his good defensive performances during the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League (in particular, games against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal) gained him praise. On 17 May 2006 Gilberto played for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League Final against FC Barcelona, which Arsenal lost 2–1.

Following the departure of defender Sol Campbell and retirement of striker Dennis Bergkamp in the summer of 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal&#x27;s vice-captain for the 2006–07 season. He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch DSB Stadion in a pre-season friendly match. He then scored Arsenal&#x27;s first ever goal in a competitive match at the Emirates Stadium in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa. His good form continued for Arsenal as he scored several league goals, garnering praise for his performances as stand-in captain while Thierry Henry was injured. Gilberto and his agent (Paulo Villana) also reiterated the player&#x27;s desire to honour his contract with the Gunners. Meanwhile, Gilberto&#x27;s good form carried through to the second half of the season. Even though Arsenal only managed to finish fourth in the league, he ended the season as Arsenal&#x27;s second highest scorer with 10 Premier League goals. The explanation for his unusually high tally is the fact that Henry suffered two lengthy injury spells, in which Gilberto stepped up as captain to take penalties. Gilberto&#x27;s goal scoring record combined with his own good form in midfield and his leadership of Wenger&#x27;s youthful squad led some Arsenal fans and football pundits to label Gilberto as Arsenal&#x27;s best player of the season, and one of the best in the Premier League.

The buildup of the 2007–08 season saw Arsenal captain Thierry Henry leave the club to join Barcelona. This coupled with the fact that Gilberto was Arsenal&#x27;s vice-captain during the 2006–07 season led many people to assume that Gilberto would take over Henry&#x27;s role. However, to the surprise of Gilberto, William Gallas was given the captain&#x27;s armband instead. In August, after returning to Arsenal&#x27;s pre-season training late due to his involvement in the Copa América tournament (and thus missing the start of the season), Gilberto then lost his place in the first team to young midfielder Mathieu Flamini. This reignited speculation linking Gilberto to Italy due to rumours that he was unhappy being on the bench at Arsenal. However, reports that he was being snubbed at the club were dismissed by Wenger, who insisted that Gilberto would remain at Arsenal to fight for his place. Despite this, in October 2007, rumours in the press re-emerged that Gilberto was angry at Wenger for being asked to play in defence in a League Cup game against Sheffield United, and had resultantly refused to play. Gilberto ended up playing the game in midfield though, with he and Wenger both denying rumours of a rift with each other. Gilberto subsequently commented that while he was not happy being a substitute, he would remain professional and fight for his place at the club. Also in October, Gilberto ceded the Brazilian captaincy to Lúcio upon his compatriot&#x27;s return from injury.

Through the winter months of the 2007–08 season, Gilberto started a limited number of games for the &quot;Gunners&quot;, though he kept his place in the Brazil team, starting several games for &quot;A Seleção&quot;. After becoming more and more frustrated with not playing regularly, Gilberto admitted in February 2008 that he had been made to feel &quot;totally useless&quot; by Wenger. Despite this, he declined to make a decision on his future; something which prompted Wenger to promise talks with Gilberto. Amidst Gilberto&#x27;s frustration at Arsenal, he targeted playing in Brazil&#x27;s Olympic team in Beijing during August 2008; a competition which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was reported to have passed his UK Citizenship test, and that he would subsequently apply for a British passport. April saw Gilberto&#x27;s season take a turn for the better; making 5 starts – a substantial portion of his seasonal total of 12 – even managing to score a goal. The goal came against Reading on 19 April, and despite its deflective nature leading to some classing it as a possible own goal, the Premier League&#x27;s Dubious Goals Committee eventually credited the goal to Gilberto. However, Gilberto&#x27;s return to favour did not stop Arsenal&#x27;s 2007–08 season ending trophyless. The club subsequently faced the possibility of several players leaving; among those rumoured to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the first team. The Frenchman ended up moving to A.C. Milan on 6 May, and a subsequent gap was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto became less likely to leave the club during Summer 2008 as a result, and Wenger remarked that he wanted to keep Gilberto; Gilberto saying he wanted to stay and possibly even renew his contract at Arsenal. Gilberto finished the 2007–08 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, albeit only 12 of these being Premier League starts.

===Panathinaikos===
Following Brazil&#x27;s summer international games, he was seriously linked with a move to Greek club Panathinaikos. The speculation concluded when Gilberto agreed terms with the Athenian side on 17 July 2008, for an undisclosed fee. During his first season at the club, Gilberto helped the side reach the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. He managed to win both the 2009–10 Greek Championship and Cup with Panathinaikos, being the starting holding midfielder and producing numerous solid displays. In Gilberto&#x27;s final home game for Panathinaikos on 23 May 2011, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over PAOK, for the Greek UEFA Champions League playoffs. Two days later, he played his final game for the team, winning 2–0 against AEK Athens.

===Later career===
On 23 May 2011, Gilberto ended his 9-year career in Europe by signing an 18-month deal with Grêmio, of Porto Alegre.

In the past, Gilberto hinted that he may one day return to Brazil to play for Atlético Mineiro. After his football career finishes, he has said that he would like to, &quot;Live in a small farm and ride a horse and have all of my family next to me.&quot; On 10 November 2012, it was confirmed that Gilberto&#x27;s wish would be granted, as he signed a pre-contract with &quot;Galo&quot;.

On 9 December 2012, Gilberto was welcomed at Aeroporto dos Confins by fans of Atlético Mineiro, returning to the Belo Horizonte side after 11 years away. Gilberto spoke of winning the 2013 Copa Libertadores title upon his return. Gilberto achieved this wish on 24 July 2013, with a final victory over Club Olimpia of Paraguay.

On 11 December 2015, after two years without a club, he officially announced his retirement as a footballer, intending to pursue a career as an international consultant for clubs and players.

==International career==
In October 2001, his good performances from that year earned Gilberto a call up to the Brazil national team (&quot;A Seleção&quot;) by Luiz Felipe Scolari for the 2002 World Cup qualification games. He made his international debut against Chile on 7 October, coming on as a substitute. On 7 November, he made his debut in the starting line-up of the national team against Bolivia. His international career continued to flourish in early 2002: he scored twice against Bolivia and once against Iceland. In 2002, he was a surprise inclusion in the Brazil squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. He was expected to play a small part in the tournament. However, defensive midfielder and Brazilian team captain Emerson was injured in training just before the first World Cup game. In light of the setback, coach Scolari called upon Gilberto to fill the gap which Emerson left. Gilberto ended up playing in every minute of every match of the tournament, which Brazil went on to win. In the words of Veja magazine, Gilberto &quot;carried the piano for Ronaldo and Rivaldo to play their tunes on&quot;. He was not without attacking use either, setting up Ronaldo&#x27;s semi-final goal to put Brazil through to the final. It was Gilberto&#x27;s performance in this tournament which led to him being classed as one of the top defensive midfielders in the world.

On 22 June 2005, Gilberto played in Brazil&#x27;s 2–2 draw against Japan, in his only game of the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. His absence as a first team regular could be explained by his lack of games, and thus match fitness, for Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament. Gilberto&#x27;s appearance in the tournament gained him a winners medal, as Brazil went on to win the competition. On the back of his good Champions League form, Gilberto was selected for the Brazil national football team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Gilberto was substituted on in two games, and started twice due to another injury to Emerson. Brazil were beaten 1–0 by France in the quarter final. Following Brazil&#x27;s World Cup disappointment, midfielder Juninho called for the older members of the Brazil squad (including Gilberto) to retire from international football. On the back of Gilberto&#x27;s childhood idol Dunga being appointed Brazil coach, Gilberto did not take Juninho&#x27;s advice, and subsequently continued his international career.

On 1 June 2007, Gilberto captained Brazil against England at the first senior international match at the new Wembley Stadium. Having had a seemingly good headed goal disallowed after 20 minutes, he set up Brazil&#x27;s only goal as the game ended 1–1. During the summer of 2007 Gilberto played in the Copa América tournament, in which he was chosen to captain Brazil in the absence of Lúcio. They went on to beat Argentina 3–0 in the final, though he missed the final game through suspension. Following the end of the 2007–08 Premier League season, Gilberto was called up to the Brazil national team for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which they retained the title with a 3-2 win over the United States and for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers during the summer as well as a tour of the United States.

==Style of play==
Gilberto is often called &quot;the invisible wall&quot;. His play often goes unnoticed as he positions himself between the two centre backs and the rest of midfield, breaking up opposition attacks before they gather momentum. In this role, he is a part of the defensive unit for both club and country. When playing, he is more passive than most players in defence. Rather than tackle an opponent, he is more likely to shadow him, thus pushing him back. As a result, he has an unusually clean record for a defensive midfielder: he has twice gone 45 games or more without receiving a single booking during his Arsenal career.

Gilberto is good at helping to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition&#x27;s attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition&#x27;s supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, something to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.

Despite Gilberto&#x27;s high pass completion rate, his passing has been described as erratic in the past.

According to ProZone (a data analysis system used by football managers) figures cited by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in January 2007, Gilberto was, together with Paul Scholes of Manchester United and Frank Lampard of Chelsea, one of the few midfielders in England to attain &quot;the elite Champions League level&quot; of performance.

==Outside playing career==
Gilberto is a patron of The Street League, a UK based charity which organises football matches for homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers. In June 2003, he travelled to Brazil on tour with 17 Street League players. The tour included a visit to his home town Lagoa da Prata and games against local shanty town teams at the Maracanã stadium.

Gilberto plays the guitar and used to play the mandolin; whilst with the Brazil squad on the buses, he would often be a part of customary music and singing routines ahead of matches with Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos. He also has a giant anteater named after him at London Zoo. Gilberto is an adoptee of the animal, which he received from a London Zoo competition winner. The footballer described the South American animal as &quot;my slightly more hairy brother!&quot;

During the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, he served as a studio analyst for ESPN on ABC alongside former Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy. Gilberto later worked on an expert panel during BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, he featured alongside Jürgen Klinsmann, Vincent Kompany, Didier Drogba, Laura Georges, Pablo Zabaleta and Mark Schwarzer.

In May 2016, Gilberto joined Panathinaikos as technical director; he left in December, after seven months in the role. Gilberto serves as an ambassador for both Arsenal and FIFA, he was also named the 23rd FIFA Master class patron by the International Centre for Sports Studies in 2023 for his contribution to football.

<text>Kristen Anne Bell (born July 18, 1980) is an American actress, singer, and producer. She began her acting career starring in stage productions, while attending the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. She made her Broadway stage debut as Becky Thatcher in the comedy musical &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (2001) and appeared in a Broadway revival of &quot;The Crucible&quot; (2002). She then appeared in the action film &quot;Spartan&quot; and received praise for her performance in the television drama film &quot;Gracie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (both 2004).

Bell had her breakout performance as the title character in the television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2004–2007), a role she reprised in the 2014 spin-off film and the 2019 revival. She also starred as Elle Bishop in the superhero drama series &quot;Heroes&quot; (2007–2008), voiced the titular narrator in the teen drama series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; (2007–2012) and its 2021 standalone sequel, and starred in the Showtime comedy series &quot;House of Lies&quot; (2012–2016). She received nominations for Golden Globe Awards for her leading roles in the NBC comedy series &quot;The Good Place&quot; (2016–2020) and the Netflix romantic comedy series &quot;Nobody Wants This&quot; (2024).

During her time on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, Bell starred in the television musical film &quot;Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical&quot; (2005) and the horror film &quot;Pulse&quot; (2006). She has since appeared in a number of comedy films, including &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot; (2008), &quot;Couples Retreat&quot; (2009), &quot;You Again&quot; (2010), &quot;The Boss&quot; (2016), &quot;Bad Moms&quot; (2016), and &quot;A Bad Moms Christmas&quot; (2017). She received further recognition for voicing Princess Anna in the Disney animated films &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) and &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019).

==Early life and family==
Kristen Anne Bell was born on July 18, 1980, in Huntington Woods, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, United States. Her mother, Lorelei Jo (), was a registered nurse, and her father, Thomas Michael &quot;Tom&quot; Bell, was a television news director. Bell has described her mother as &quot;very religious&quot;, something that put a strain on their relationship. Her mother is of Polish descent, and her father has German, Scottish and Irish ancestry. They divorced when Bell was 6 months old; both have since remarried, and Bell has 6 siblings: two half-sisters from her father&#x27;s second marriage and four step-siblings from her mother&#x27;s second marriage.

At the age of four, Bell stated that she did not like her first name, so her mother encouraged her to use her middle name, Anne, which she used until she attended high school.

Just before her first year of high school, Bell&#x27;s parents decided to remove her from the public school system. She attended Shrine Catholic High School in nearby Royal Oak, where she took part in the drama and music clubs. Before attending Shrine, she attended Burton Elementary School, part of the Berkley School District. At Shrine, she won the starring role in the school&#x27;s 1997 production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as Dorothy Gale, and appeared in productions of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1995), &quot;Lady, Be Good&quot; (1996), and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1998). In 1998, the year she graduated, she was named the yearbook&#x27;s &quot;Best Looking Lil&#x27; Lady&quot; by senior class vote.

Shortly after her high school graduation, Bell moved to New York City to attend New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, studying musical theater. She left a few credits shy of graduating to play in a broadway musical, and she said about this: &quot;You get to the point where you don&#x27;t need a degree to be an actor.&quot;

==Career==
===1992–2003: Early work===
In 1992, Bell went to her first audition and won a dual role as a banana and a tree in a suburban Detroit theater&#x27;s production of &quot;Raggedy Ann and Andy&quot;. Her mother had established her with an agent before Bell was 13, which allowed her to appear in newspaper advertisements for several Detroit retailers and television commercials. She began private acting lessons. In 1998, she had an uncredited role in the film &quot;Polish Wedding&quot;. In 2001, Bell left New York University to play Becky Thatcher in the short-lived Broadway musical of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. That year, she made her credited film debut in &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;. Her single line of dialogue was cut, and she appears only during the credits.

In 2002, she appeared in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Crucible&quot; with Liam Neeson, Angela Bettis and Laura Linney. Bell moved to Los Angeles in 2002 because of her friendship with writers Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, and appeared in a handful of television shows as a special guest, finding trouble gaining a recurring role in a television series. Bell said she &quot;tested like eight times and booked nothing and every show [she] tested for got picked up&quot;, including auditions for &quot;Skin&quot; and what she called &quot;that Norm Macdonald show&quot;. In 2003, Bell appeared in FX&#x27;s &quot;The Shield&quot;, season 2, episode 1, which aired on January 7, 2003. She appeared in &quot;Everwood&quot;, season 2 episode 2 as a cheerleader. She co-starred in the film &quot;The King and Queen of Moonlight Bay&quot; as Alison, a 17-year-old girl who travels to Arizona to reconnect with the father who abandoned her family.

===2004–2006: &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; and other roles===
In 2004, Bell earned acclaim for her starring role in the Lifetime television film &quot;Gracie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, which received one of the network&#x27;s highest ratings. She made her debut in a theatrically released film with David Mamet&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Spartan&quot;, as Laura Newton, the kidnapped daughter of the U.S. president, acting alongside Val Kilmer. Bell guest-starred on the HBO period drama series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, in a two-episode story arc (&quot;Bullock Returns to the Camp&quot; and &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot;).

At 24, she won the role of the title character in the UPN noir drama series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student and private detective. Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica and her own life, since Bell&#x27;s parents had divorced and her best friend had also died. The series earned acclaim from critics. Bell&#x27;s performance earned her the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television and a nomination for the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, among numerous others. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for a Primetime Emmy Award.

Aside from working on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, Bell starred in &quot;Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical&quot;, reprising the role she played in the short-lived 2001 Off-Broadway musical. The musical was a spoof of &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;, the 1936 exploitation film. &quot;Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical&quot; debuted on the Showtime network on April 16, 2005. Also in April, Bell starred as Gracie in &quot;Fifty Pills&quot;, an entry for the Tribeca Film Festival. She appeared in a short independent film called &quot;The Receipt&quot; and the horror film &quot;Roman&quot;, which was directed by her &quot;Crucible&quot; co-star Angela Bettis. Released on August 11, 2006, &quot;Pulse&quot; starred Bell as the lead Mattie. A remake of the Japanese horror film &quot;Kairo&quot;, the film grossed US$27.9 million worldwide but garnered negative response from critics. Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented, &quot;despite the starring presence of Kristen Bell, [the] young actress has far less interesting material to work with here than she does as [the character] &#x27;Veronica Mars.&#x27;&quot;

===2007–2011: Film breakthrough and &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;===
&quot;Veronica Mars&quot; continued on UPN for a second season; for the third season, the show was renewed and appeared on the newly created The CW. On January 19, 2007, CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff announced that while she was pleased with the gradual improvement of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; ratings, the series would be put on hiatus after February sweeps to air a new reality series, &quot;Pussycat Dolls Present&quot;. On May 17, 2007, Ostroff announced the cancelation of the series. A two-hour series finale aired in the United States on May 22, 2007, and on June 11, 2007, Thomas officially announced in an email to &quot;TV Guide&quot; Michael Ausiello that &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; had been canceled by The CW. A &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; feature film and comic book series continuation had been discussed, and for a short time there was talk of another collaboration between Bell and creator Thomas that would be unrelated to the &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; series.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, Bell voiced interest in appearing on &quot;Heroes&quot; because she was a fan. On July 29, 2007, during a train ride back to Los Angeles from San Diego Comic-Con with &quot;Heroes&quot; actors Zachary Quinto and Masi Oka, and writers from the series, the writers had mentioned that if she &quot;ever want[ed] to come on &quot;Heroes&quot;, give us [writers] a call,&quot; to which Bell said she would &quot;love to&quot;. Meanwhile, there were discussions about a role on &quot;Lost&quot;, but Bell turned down the role of Charlotte Staples Lewis. Bell portrayed Elle Bishop on &quot;Heroes&quot;, a &quot;mysterious young lady&quot; with an &quot;awesome power&quot;. She did not have to audition for the role of Elle, who made her first appearance in an October 2007 episode, and appeared in twelve episodes during the run of the series. The casting of Bell, &quot;Heroes&quot; creator Tim Kring explained, &quot;was not easy to pull off&quot;, but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, &quot;we found a way to jump into a small window in [Bell&#x27;s] schedule.&quot; Bell lent her voice to The CW series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;; she voiced the titular character in every episode of the series, appearing in person only for a surprise cameo in the final episode, portraying herself.

Shortly after the cancelation of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; in early 2007, Bell filmed on location in Hawaii for a starring role as the title character in the Judd Apatow comedy &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;. She regarded the improvisational comedy in the film as &quot;a lovely experience&quot;. The film, written by and also starring Jason Segel, was released theatrically on April 18, 2008, and greatly increased Bell&#x27;s profile. Bell lent her voice and likeness to the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, which was released in November 2007 for consoles and April 2008 for the PC. Bell reprised her role of Lucy in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;, released in November 2009, and again in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;, released in November 2010. In the spring of 2006, she finished filming the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed comedy &quot;Fanboys&quot;. Director Kyle Newman received additional funding to shoot new scenes, but the busy schedules of the actors only allowed for filming in September 2007. As a result, the release was delayed until January 14, 2008. Bell starred in the 2009 comedies &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot;, alongside Meg Ryan, and &quot;Couples Retreat&quot;, which chronicles four couples who partake in therapy sessions at a tropical island resort. Jason Bateman played her husband. She provided the voice for Cora in &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. On March 31, 2008, Bell began shooting the Mark Steven Johnson-written Disney film &quot;When in Rome&quot; on location in Rome and New York; the film was released in 2010. Bell reprised her role as Sarah Marshall for a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot;, a spin-off sequel from &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot;, released June 4, 2010.

Bell co-starred alongside singers Christina Aguilera and Cher in the backstage musical film &quot;Burlesque&quot;, which was released in November 2010. She had a cameo appearance alongside Anna Paquin in the slasher horror film &quot;Scream 4&quot;, which was released on April 15, 2011.

===2012–2019: &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;The Good Place&quot;===
In 2012, Bell starred in the family drama film &quot;Big Miracle&quot;. She appeared in the music video for &quot;Madder Red&quot; by Brooklyn experimental rock band Yeasayer. Bell portrayed Mary Magdalene in &quot;The Truth &amp; Life Dramatized Audio New Testament Bible&quot;, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, dramatized audio adaptation of the New Testament that uses the RSV-CE translation.

Bell starred as Jeannie van der Hooven, the female lead on the Showtime comedy series &quot;House of Lies&quot;, which premiered on January 8, 2012. The series ended on June 12, 2016. Bell appeared in a supporting role in the science-fiction comedy &quot;Safety Not Guaranteed&quot; (2012). She starred in the drama film &quot;The Lifeguard&quot;, written and directed by Liz W. Garcia, which began filming in July 2012 and was released in August 2013. She voiced Anna in &quot;Frozen&quot;, which was released on November 27, 2013. In 2013, for multiple episodes, Bell played Ingrid de Forest, an Eagleton City Councilwoman, on &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;.

On March 13, 2013, it was confirmed that a &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; film would be coming to fruition. Bell and series creator Rob Thomas launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in less than ten hours. The main cast members of the series all reprised their roles in the feature film. Production of the film took place during summer 2013, and it was released theatrically and on video-on-demand on March 14, 2014.

In September 2014, Bell starred with her husband, Dax Shepard, in a commercial for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S. It was so popular (with over 20 million YouTube views) that they did another for the holiday season. The ad agency McKinney was behind both. In 2016, Bell voiced the sloth Priscilla in the animated comedy film &quot;Zootopia&quot;, and starred as Claire in the comedy film &quot;The Boss&quot;. Bell starred as Kiki in the 2016 comedy film &quot;Bad Moms&quot;, a role she reprised in the 2017 sequel, &quot;A Bad Moms Christmas&quot;. In 2016, Bell began starring as Eleanor Shellstrop in the NBC comedy series &quot;The Good Place&quot;. For her performance, she received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy, the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, and the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.

Also in 2017, she appeared in the biographical comedy-drama &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot;, the action comedy &quot;CHiPs&quot; and the comedy &quot;How to Be a Latin Lover&quot;. In November 2017, she played a housewife (with Dax Shepard as her husband) preparing for a Christmas party in Sia&#x27;s music video for &quot;Santa&#x27;s Coming for Us&quot;.

In 2018, she began hosting the web series &quot;Momsplaining with Kristen Bell&quot;, with episodes airing on the Ellen DeGeneres video platform Ellentube. In the series, Bell gives new and expecting mothers tips about motherhood. The title of the series is a pun on the commonly used term &quot;mansplaining&quot;. Bell later had the leading role in the Netflix comedy-drama film &quot;Like Father&quot;. She voiced the character of Jade Wilson in the animated comedy film &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot; and reprised her voice role as Princess Anna in the animated comedy sequel film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;.

On September 20, 2018, Hulu confirmed that Bell would reprise her role of Veronica Mars in an eight-episode fourth season of the drama series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, which would premiere in July 2019. In 2019, she again reprised her role of Princess Anna in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; and the sequel &quot;Frozen II&quot; which was released on November 22, 2019. Bell served as host and executive producer on the Disney+ docuseries &quot;Encore!&quot;, which premiered in November 2019. She made her directorial debut with the eighth episode of the fourth season of &quot;The Good Place&quot;. The series concluded after its fourth season, airing its final episode in January 2020. At the 25th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards, Bell received the #SeeHer Award, which recognizes women who &quot;push boundaries on changing stereotypes and acknowledge the importance of authentic portrayals of women across the entertainment landscape&quot;.

=== Since 2020: Established actress ===
In 2020, Bell published the children&#x27;s book &quot;The World Needs More Purple People&quot;, which she co-wrote with Benjamin Hart. Also in 2020, Bell voiced Molly Tillerman in the Apple TV+ animated musical comedy series &quot;Central Park&quot;, which reunited her with &quot;Frozen&quot; co-star Josh Gad and &quot;Bad Moms&quot; co-star Kathryn Hahn. &quot;Central Park&quot; received a two-season order from Apple and the series premiered on May 29, 2020. In June 2020, it was announced that Bell, who is white, would no longer voice the biracial character of Molly. The role would be re-cast with a black or mixed race actress, with Bell voicing a new role.

In 2021, Bell produces and voices a lead character in the Amazon Prime Video animated musical pre-school series &quot;Do, Re, &amp; Mi&quot;. She returned to narrate as the titular character of the HBO Max teen drama series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, a soft reboot and sequel to the 2007–2012 series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. Bell starred alongside Kirby Howell-Baptiste as a pair of housewives who created a multi-million dollar coupon scam in the comedy film &quot;Queenpins&quot;. The film was released to Paramount+ on September 10, 2021.

Her miniseries &quot;The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window&quot; was released on Netflix in January 2022. In November 2022, Bell starred in the Amazon Prime movie &quot;The People We Hate at the Wedding&quot;. Bell appeared in three episodes of &quot;The Tiny Chef Show&quot; and serves as the show&#x27;s executive producer.

Bell also played the main character an agnostic sex podcaster by the name of Joanne in &quot;Nobody Wants This&quot; (2024). Her performance earned her another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.

In 2006 and again in 2013, Bell was selected &quot;World&#x27;s Sexiest Vegetarian&quot; on PETA&#x27;s yearly poll. She was placed 68 on &quot;Maxim&quot;″s 2005 &quot;Hot 100&quot; list, 11 in &quot;Maxim&quot;″s 2006 &quot;Hot 100&quot; list, and 46 in &quot;Maxim&quot;″s 2007 &quot;Hot 100&quot; list in which she was stated to have &quot;single-handedly saved The CW from becoming the worst network ever&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Maxim&quot; also placed Bell at the top of the &quot;Fall TV&#x27;s Criminally Sexy Investigators&quot; List. In 2008, she was ranked 59 on AskMen&#x27;s Top 99 Women of 2008 List. Reflecting on her admitted popularity with &quot;geeks&quot;, Bell was voted the fourth-sexiest woman on TV by the staff at &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine.

Bell stated she never thought of herself as womanly because &quot;I always play and look and act 10 years younger than I am.&quot; However, she said, &quot;Something magical happened when I turned 25—I looked in the mirror and was like, &#x27;You might not get carded for an R-rated movie anymore.&#x27; Like I didn&#x27;t have a little stick figure anymore.&quot; Bell has said that many of her characters are tomboys because she was &quot;not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl&quot;.

Bell has been associated with the idea that &quot;nerdy is the new cool&quot;, and she explained, &quot;what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, geekiness, is it doesn&#x27;t really matter what you&#x27;re into—it just means you&#x27;re not a follower.&quot; She has also said, &quot;I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn&#x27;t that funny? The tables have turned.&quot; Vanessa Juarez of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that Bell&#x27;s roles on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot; and as a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fanatic in &quot;Fanboys&quot; have &quot;solidif[ied] her placement at the center of the geek universe,&quot; while Rodney Rothman stated, &quot;I guess she&#x27;s cornered the market on losers.&quot; Bell&#x27;s work is often compared to Sarah Michelle Gellar&#x27;s portrayal of the title character on the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that Bell was &quot;arguably the television successor [to Gellar&#x27;s portrayal of Buffy] when it comes to fighting bad guys.&quot; Bell is sometimes confused with Lauren Conrad from &quot;The Hills&quot;. &quot;Yeah, sometimes fans yell, &#x27;Hey, Lauren&#x27; to me, but usually from a distance,&quot; said Bell.

Despite &quot;new celebrity&quot; status, Bell claimed that she was not concerned because &quot;no one ever recognizes me anyway&quot;. She has said that her friend Hayden Panettiere is more famous than she is and attracts more attention; as Bell explained, &quot;I hang out with Hayden quite a bit—they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and I push myself in front of her when she wants to get out of it, or put her in the car.&quot;

Bell was a recurring guest on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig Ferguson&#x27;s robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Ferguson&#x27;s sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Peterson down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five &quot;Late Late Show&quot; episodes filmed in France.

In January 2011, it was announced that Bell would be the new face of Neutrogena. In 2014, Bell posed nude for the May issue of &quot;Allure&quot; magazine – alongside Jenna Dewan, Minnie Driver, and Nia Long. In April 2019, Bell was featured on the cover of &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine&#x27;s April–May issue. In the article, she discussed her snack bar company, This Bar Saves Lives, which donates its sales to help feed malnourished children around the globe. In November 2019, Bell and Idina Menzel, who play sisters in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Frozen&quot; franchise, received neighboring stars—Bell&#x27;s was the 2681st and Menzel&#x27;s was the 2682nd—on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
In 2007, Bell ended a five-year relationship with former fiancé Kevin Mann. She later told &quot;Complex&quot; magazine that dating &quot;makes me want to vomit. And not out of grossness—OK, a little bit out of grossness, but just nerves... I&#x27;ve always been a serial monogamist.&quot;

In late 2007, Bell began dating actor Dax Shepard, who is also from the Detroit metropolitan area. They announced their engagement in January 2010. They decided to delay marriage until the state of California passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage. They co-starred in the 2010 film &quot;When in Rome&quot;, the 2012 film &quot;Hit and Run&quot;, and the 2017 film &quot;CHiPs&quot;. After section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, Bell asked Shepard to marry her through Twitter, which he accepted. They were married at the Beverly Hills County Clerk&#x27;s Office on October 16, 2013. They have two daughters, born in March 2013, and December 2014.

===Mental health===
In May 2016, Bell stated that she has received treatment for depression and anxiety. She said, &quot;It&#x27;s important for me to be candid about this so people in a similar situation can realize that they are not worthless and that they do have something to offer.&quot; In 2020, Bell also blogged about her anxiety since age of 18, and said that, &quot;Don’t be fooled by this game of perfection that humans play. Because Instagram and magazines and TV shows, they strive for a certain aesthetic, and everything looks so beautiful, and people seem like they don’t have any problems, but everyone’s human. Everyone has problems. Everyone feels yucky on the inside sometimes.&quot;

In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel in August 2018, Bell discussed why she wears scuba gloves while swimming. She stated that she fears the sensation of touching things with water-immersed, wrinkled fingers, otherwise known as &quot;prune fingers&quot;. The gloves have allowed her to swim with her children without fearing touching them.

===Beliefs and interests===
At age 11, Bell became a vegetarian. In an interview with PETA, Bell stated, &quot;I have always been an animal lover. I had a hard time disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!&quot;. By 2012 Bell had become vegan with Shepard after watching the documentary &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot;. During her first pregnancy, she returned to eating dairy products and eggs, however.

Bell has stated she is non-religious and identifies as a humanist. She and her husband Dax Shepard are pro-vaccination. Bell supported and campaigned for Barack Obama during the 2008 United States presidential election. Along with Rashida Jones, she visited college campuses in Missouri to discuss the candidates and encourage voter registration. Bell showed support for the Writers Guild of America in the writers&#x27; strike, appearing in the picket lines in December 2007, stating, &quot;the writers are just looking for some fairness&quot;.

In 2023, Bell revealed that she had taken up Brazilian jiu-jitsu. She was training under Cesalina Gracie in mother-daughter classes alongside her daughter.

===Charity work===
During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from the Michigan Humane Society, and she now supports the San Diego–based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fundraisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has had several dogs, including a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 years old when she was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.

Bell and other &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; cast members, including Ryan Hansen, are involved with the charity Invisible Children, Inc. The goal of the organization is to create awareness of the plight of Northern Ugandans who are caught in the midst of a civil war between the government and Joseph Kony&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army. In 2014, Bell launched a Prizeo campaign offering fans a chance to win a date with her in return for donating to Invisible Children, Inc. In 2018, Bell participated in a television advertisement for bone marrow donations, specifically the Gift of Life Marrow Registry. Her actions resulted in several matches that are documented on the Gift of Life website. Bell won a 2020 Webby Special Achievement Award.

In 2013, Kristen Bell, along with actors Ryan Devlin, Todd Grinnell, and Ravi Patel, founded the granola bar company This Bar Saves Lives to help fight malnutrition. The business donates food aid in the form of nutrition packets to children in Haiti, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Since its launch, the company has donated more than 10 million packets as of February 2019.

===Entrepreneurship===
In 2019, Bell and her husband founded the company Hello Bello that markets plant-based baby care products said to be environmentally friendly and affordable. As of 2021, Hello Bello&#x27;s estimated annual revenue was $26.1 million a year with 104 employees. In 2020, she partnered to start Happy Dance, a line of vegan CBD products such as eye cream and hand moisturizers. In 2023, Hello Bello filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, blaming years of declining sales and the financial startup crisis. The company is set to be acquired by private equity firm Hildred Capital Management.

<text>Johann Peter Uz (October 3, 1720 – May 12, 1796) was a German poet.

==Life==
He was born at Ansbach.
He studied law in 1739–43 at the university of Halle, where he associated with the Rococo poets Johann Gleim and Johann Nikolaus Götz, and in conjunction with the latter translated the odes of Anacreon (1746).

In 1748 Uz was appointed unpaid secretary to the Justizcollegium, an office he held for twelve years; in 1763 he became assessor to the imperial court of justice at Nuremberg, in 1790 was made a judge.

A monument to Uz stands in the Ansbach Court Garden. It was near this monument, in 1833, that Kaspar Hauser was murdered.

<text>Fredrik Carl Thordendal (born 11 February 1970) is a Swedish musician best known as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the extreme metal band Meshuggah, of which he is a founding member. Along with Meshuggah&#x27;s rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström, Thordendal was rated No. 35 by &quot;Guitar World&quot; in their list of the top 100 greatest heavy metal guitarists of all time.

== Career ==
===Meshuggah===

Thordendal began his career when he formed &#x27;Metallien,&#x27; a heavily Metallica-influenced band, in his hometown of Umeå in 1985. The band later changed their name to Meshuggah and released their first LP, &quot;Psykisk Testbild&quot;, in 1989. Starting as a thrash metal band, Meshuggah&#x27;s music gradually evolved into a more progressive sound. This sound has become influential to other bands, such as Periphery, whose core member, Misha Mansoor, was instrumental in coining the term &quot;Djent&quot; to refer to the commonly utilized technique of playing heavily muted, extended power chords found in Meshuggah&#x27;s music. Thordendal has been widely recognized in the metal community for his work with Meshuggah.

Sometime in the 90s, before the release of &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;, Thordendal was involved in a carpentry accident at work in which he cut off the tip of his left middle finger. The fingertip was sewn back on, and after a significant amount of re-learning and practicing, he regained full proficiency on the guitar within a year or so.

===Fredrik Thordendal&#x27;s Special Defects: &quot;Sol Niger Within&quot;===
Under the name Fredrik Thordendal&#x27;s Special Defects, Thordendal released a solo album in 1997 titled &quot;Sol Niger Within&quot; with Ultimate Audio Entertainment. The album was remixed and re-released by Ultimate Audio Entertainment and Relapse Records in 1999 under the title &quot;Sol Niger Within Version 3.33&quot;. The re-release contains two bonus tracks but omits several parts of the original version. The newly mastered version of &quot;SNW&quot; was also released for the first time on vinyl in 2016 by Husaria Records, an American label specializing in audiophile releases. The album&#x27;s original material was pressed in both a lacquer cut variant (500 units) and a Direct Metal Mastering variant (500 units). Thordendal also contributed to several tracks for drummer Morgan Ågren&#x27;s Mats/Morgan Band.

Regarding a second Special Defects album, Thordendal states, &quot;It&#x27;s actually been messing with my head for years now. I haven&#x27;t really found the time to get the project going. This is a project that I will work on for a longer time, with no rush whatsoever, to make it the best I possibly can. I&#x27;m looking forward to making it because I think it will sound so different from anything I&#x27;ve ever heard before.&quot;

===Other projects and contributions===

Thordendal has been involved in numerous side projects, such as XXX Atomic Toejam with Petter Marklund. The project initially released a 7&quot; two-track single titled &#x27;Celebration&#x27; under the name Sepülchre Inc. They later adopted the name XXX Atomic Toejam and issued an MCD entitled &quot;A Gathering of the Tribes for the First / Last Human Be-In&quot; on Cold Meat Industry, as well as featuring a track on the &quot;Karmanik Collection&quot; compilation. A full-length album was long announced but never materialized. Thordendal also played bass for Petter Marklund&#x27;s solo project, Memorandum, and, together with Marklund, remixed tracks on the 1995 compilation album &quot;Ars Moriendi&quot;.

In 2010, Thordendal recorded some drum tracks with Morgan Ågren of the Swedish prog-rock band Kaipa and Dirk Verbeuren of Soilwork.

Several of Thordendal&#x27;s demos have been released on the internet as MP3s or as videos on YouTube. &quot;Demo 33&quot; was used to demonstrate a MIDI breath controller created by Johan Haake, which is used on several Meshuggah songs, including Future Breed Machine.

Thordendal is also a notable producer, having produced all of Meshuggah&#x27;s recent material as well as releases for various other bands, including Switzerland&#x27;s Fragment.

Thordendal is featured in the Darkane track &#x27;Psychic Pain&#x27; from the album &quot;Insanity&quot;, performing lead guitar. He also contributed to the song &#x27;Asphyxiate,&#x27; which can be found on Scarve&#x27;s album &quot;Irradiant&quot;. Additionally, he played a guitar solo on the title track of the Devin Townsend Project album &quot;Deconstruction&quot;.

He also contributed to the soundtracks of the video games &quot;&quot;, released 2014, and &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot;, released 2017.

== Playing style and influences ==

As a guitarist, Thordendal stands out for his clean, complex lead playing, inspired by jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth, and for his intricate rhythm playing, which often features prominent polymetric passages. These characteristics are further enhanced by his use of seven- and eight-string guitars. He contributes significantly to songwriting and also provides backing vocals for some songs during live performances.

Thordendal has cited Metallica and Tool as influences on Meshuggah. Meshuggah supported Tool during their U.S. tour in the fall of 2002, where drummer Tomas Haake even made a guest appearance, playing &#x27;Triad&#x27; with the band.

Thordendal has praised jazz fusion guitarist Wayne Krantz&#x27;s work with Keith Carlock and Tim Lefebvre, stating that &quot;these guys are the most inspiring band I&#x27;ve heard in a very long time.&quot; He has also mentioned that he listens to Massive Attack and Cult of Luna.

In a 2011 interview with Guitar World, Thordendal stated: 

&quot;My dad always listened to jazz, and I guess that influenced me to learn about improvisation. An improvised solo sounds so much better than a written one. For me, there&#x27;s not much thinking going on at all, only a reaction to what I&#x27;m being told from the inside. And no, I have not had any formal training. When I record my leads, they are usually based on feel and totally ignorant of all laws of music theory. This, of course, is because I just play whatever comes out. There are no rules. But on certain songs, I do have to figure out what scales I need to use to follow chord changes. Since I&#x27;m not very good with all the scales, I sometimes have to write parts down and plan things ahead. I usually improvise the first part, then insert the written part, and continue to improvise until the end of the solo. It&#x27;s a very confusing way to do it, but I do whatever it takes to make it sound like I know what I&#x27;m doing.&quot;

== Equipment ==

=== Guitars ===

Thordendal&#x27;s current main guitars are custom Ibanez 8-string M8Ms, featuring RG-shaped or Iceman-shaped alder bodies with 5-piece maple/Bubinga neck-thru necks (29.4&quot; scale), rosewood fingerboards (no inlays), fixed bridges (essentially an Ibanez FX-Edge fixed tremolo), one volume, one tone, and a Lundgren Model 8 pickup. The fixed bridge on one of his 8-strings has since been replaced with a Kahler tremolo system. Thordendal also owns a 7-string acoustic guitar, also made by Ibanez. For a time, he used Nevborn guitars, which made Meshuggah their first 8-string guitars. However, these guitars suffered from intonation problems, leading Thordendal to abandon the company and switch exclusively to Ibanez guitars. On the North American tour promoting &quot;Koloss&quot;, he used a custom Firebird, Iceman, and Explorer-type body 8-string, called the Stoneman. The Stoneman features a 27&quot; scale length, which Thordendal prefers, as mentioned by his tech in an interview with &quot;Premier Guitar&quot;. This guitar is now in production under the name Ibanez FTM33.

Thordendal utilizes a unique device for his leads, referred to as a MIDI breath controller. He states, &quot;I was mainly interested in using it as a dynamics controller. I wanted to start a note at a lower volume and then bring it up, like a saxophonist does. But I&#x27;ve since found that is more or less impossible with a guitar. Since the controller didn&#x27;t produce the sound I was after, I had to find other ways of using it. It turned out that the only thing that sounded cool was when I blew every single note with it, which generated this weird staccato sound. The first breath controller we made—the one I used on &#x27;Future Breed Machine&#x27; and &#x27;Sublevels&#x27; from &quot;Destroy Erase Improve&quot;—could only control the volume. So Johan Haake and I tried all kinds of things to get closer to what I originally wanted, like adding control over frequencies and distortion. I am really pleased with how the &#x27;Missing Time&#x27; solo turned out from Sol Niger Within Version 3.33 [the remix CD of the debut album from his side project Fredrik Thordendal&#x27;s Special Defects]. But I never thought we got close enough, so I sort of gave up on it. A couple of years ago it was for sale to the public, but not any more&quot;.

Tuning:For early Meshuggah releases, Thordendal tuned his 7-string guitars to B♭ (a half step below standard 7-string tuning). He continued this approach with 8-string guitars, tuning them down to F (F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, B♭, E♭). In an interview, it was explained that they tuned their guitars this way because, in the early days of Meshuggah, before Jens Kidman adopted his signature vocal style, it was easier for him to sing in the key of E♭ or B♭.

Occasionally, Thordendal deviates from this &quot;standard&quot; tuning. For example, on songs like &quot;Glints Collide,&quot; &quot;Organic Shadows,&quot; &quot;Perpetual Black Second,&quot; &quot;The Hurt That Finds You First,&quot; and &quot;Stengah,&quot; he tunes his 8-string guitar a half step lower to E. He also tunes it to E♭ for &quot;Nebulous&quot; and &quot;Shed,&quot; and even down to D for &quot;Obsidian.&quot; On &quot;Spasm,&quot; he tunes the lowest string down to B♭ (B♭, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, B♭, E♭), making the 8th string an octave below the 7th. Additionally, &quot;Mind&#x27;s Mirrors&quot; features the 8th string tuned down to E0.

Guitar strings:
DR Strings, Tite-Fit, LH-9 &#x27;Lite &amp; Heavy&#x27; set: [.009 – .011 – .016 – .026 – .036 – .046], with additional gauges of .052 and .070. These are the stock string gauges on the Ibanez M8M signature guitar.

Guitar picks:
Jim Dunlop 1.3mm Primetone Standard with grip
and Jim Dunlop 1.00mm Nylon Standard picks.

<text>Henry Grady Cochran, Jr. (August 3, 1923 – June 20, 1986) was Florida Director of the Division of Corrections from 1959 to 1962. He replaced R.O. Culver and was later succeeded by Louie L. Wainwright. He is notable for being the original respondent in the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;.

Born in Lake City, Florida, H. G. Cochran served in the United States Army during World War II. He enlisted on October 24, 1942 and served as a private in a field artillery unit. His unit aided in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp in 1945.

During his tenure as director the first Transition Officers were hired to assist inmates with placement upon release, a male unit was opened in the Florida Correctional Institution, the Apalachee Correctional Institution&#x27;s West Unit was opened, and the Marion Correctional Institution and Caryville Work Camp were established. Additionally, a new six-digit numbering system to identify inmates was implemented and a new maximum security unit was added to the Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida. The official newsletter of the Florida Division of Corrections, the Correctional Compass, made its debut, and on 1 October 1961, the Division of Corrections assumed responsibility for the administration of all phases of Road Prison operation from the Florida State Road Department. He died in 1986 in Leon County, Florida.

It was home to the Washington Olympics of the National Association in 1871–1872 and home to the short-lived Washington clubs of 1873 and 1875, including the Washington Blue Legs. It is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league.

The ballfield was located at 16th Street NW (east); 17th Street NW (west); and S Street NW (south); about a mile west-southwest of the eventual site of Griffith Stadium. The neighborhood is now a combination of residences and commercial businesses.

<text>Houston Public Library is the public library system serving Houston, Texas, United States.

==History==
===Houston Lyceum and the Carnegie Library===
The Houston Public Library system traces its founding to the creation of the second Houston Lyceum in 1854. The lyceum was preceded by a debating society, a special-interest mechanics&#x27; lyceum, and a circulating library. The lyceum&#x27;s library eventually split into a separate institution at the end of the 19th century.

In 1892, William Marsh Rice, a Houston businessman and philanthropist who later chartered Rice University, donated $200,000 for the construction of a free public library. The facility opened in 1895 and obtained its own building in 1904 with financial assistance from Andrew Carnegie. Betty Trapp Chapman wrote in &quot;The Houston Review&quot; that the city&#x27;s women &quot;were instrumental&quot; in the library&#x27;s establishment and that the educated women &quot;had long recognized the need for a library to serve the community.&quot; Julia Ideson was named its first librarian and she hired one employee. Located at the corner of Travis and McKinney in what is now known as Downtown Houston, it originally housed 10,000 volumes. By 1907, 10,000 Houstonians held accounts at the library. By 1913, the library counted seven persons on its payroll. The city changed the name from Carnegie Library to Houston Public Library in 1921. By this time, they had outgrown their space and relocated several staff members to the Harris County Courthouse. A few years later, the library sold its property to raise money for a larger facility.

===Julia Ideson Library===
The library board selected a lot once occupied by Thomas M. Bagby, a co-founder of the 1848 Houston Lyceum. They commissioned Cram and Ferguson as design architects, in consultation with William Ward Watkin and Louis A. Glover. The building was completed in two years and at a cost of $500,000. The Spanish Renaissance design draws from regional history, and includes carvings of explorers and missionaries of Texas. The second floor hall lay under a rotunda, fronted by an interior oaken gate with carved columns and entablatures. The new building opened with a collection of more than thirty thousand volumes. The building constructed as Houston&#x27;s Central Library in 1926 was later named the Julia Ideson Building in her honor.

===Carnegie Colored Library===
The board for the Houston Carnegie Library had planned for universal access to the facilities. However, those working at the library turned away African-Americans educators who visited in 1907, while ostensibly referring the matter to the trustees. A group of African-American educators led by Ernest O. Smith lobbied local white leaders and the Carnegie Foundation for a library to serve the black community. The Colored Carnegie Library of Houston opened in 1913 with an African American board of trustees and management. It was transferred to the management as a branch library of Houston Public Library in 1921.

On July 31, 1961, the Carnegie Colored Library closed. The library facility required extensive repairs and it was in the path of the Clay Avenue extension project. The branch, auctioned in February 1962 and shortly afterward demolished except for the cornerstone, was replaced by the W. L. D. Johnson Library in Sunnyside, dedicated on June 16, 1964.

===Expansion and branch libraries===
The library system racially desegregated in 1953. Beforehand, blacks were permitted use of the Colored Carnegie Branch and deposit stations located at a park, a high school, and an elementary school; whites were permitted use of the main library, six branches, two bookmobiles, and several deposit stations. Desegregation occurred after a letter printed in the &quot;Houston Informer&quot; from several prominent black Houstonians, including &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; plaintiff Lonnie E. Smith, stated they would prefer a voluntary desegregation program despite their likelihood of winning a lawsuit; shortly before the letter was printed, &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which challenged the &quot;separate but equal&quot; legal doctrine. In June 1953, Mayor of Houston Roy Hofheinz told the HPL board that library facilities should no longer be segregated. On August 21, 1953, library facilities for high school students and adults were desegregated – without public announcement to the black community.

The library system now consists of 35 neighborhood libraries, including four regional libraries, the Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research in the Museum District, and the Central Library in Downtown. Central Library consists of the Julia Ideson Building and the Jesse H. Jones Building, constructed in 1976. Out-of-state users are entitled to access to the Library&#x27;s resources, after paying a $40 annual fee.

The HPL administrative offices were moved out of the Jones Building, freeing of space. Lisa Gray, of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, said the renovation made the Jones Building &quot;less of a public space devoted to reading, and more of a public space, period.&quot; The offices moved to the Marston Building. In 2012, the Marston Building was sold by the City of Houston, and the HPL administrative office moved to the recently restored Julia Ideson Building while other staff offices moved back to the Jones Building.

Additions in the 2000s include McGovern-Stella Link Neighborhood Library (2005), HPL Express Southwest (2008), and HPL Express Discovery Green (2008). A new building for Looscan Neighborhood Library opened in 2007, replacing a 1956 structure.

The Jones Building closed for renovations in 2006 and reopened in 2008. That same year, the &quot;Houston Press&quot; heralded the project as Houston&#x27;s best renovation in its annual awards.

In 2010, due to a budget shortfall, the library system reduced its hours. During the same year the system put its decades-old city directories online.
==Locations==

===Headquarters===
During the Jesse H. Jones Building remodeling the HPL administrative offices moved to the Marston Building in Neartown Houston. The City of Houston spent $1.3 million to renovate the Marston Building to accommodate HPL staff. Prior to the remodeling, the HPL administrative offices were located in the Jones Building. In 2012 HPL administrative offices moved to the Julia Ideson Building
after its historically correct renovation and the addition of a wing which was in the original design, but was not built at the time due to lack of funds. This addition houses the Houston Metropolitan Research Center (HMRC) which is the archival center of the Houston Public Library System. The Marston Building was sold in 2012 by the City of Houston.

===Neighborhood libraries===

In addition to the Central Library and Clayton Library, there are 32 neighborhood libraries, including five regional libraries, all located within the city of Houston.

*J. S. Bracewell Neighborhood Library (Southbelt/Ellington)
*Carnegie Neighborhood Library (Near Northside)
*Everett Collier Regional Library
*Patricio Flores Neighborhood Library (Second Ward)
*Eleanor K. Freed-Montrose Neighborhood Library (Neartown)
**Eleanor K. Freed-Montrose Neighborhood Library was at 4100 Montrose Boulevard. The library was housed in a former church, the Central Church of Christ. The bell tower or campanile is located by the front door of the library although the bell is gone, and there is a small colonnade connecting the main church-library building to former church meeting rooms and offices. Facing Montrose Boulevard, the original stained glass window of the church can be seen featuring a dove with an olive branch in its beak. A modern office building complex in the surrounding area is known as The Campanile, named after the bell tower in the library. In 2013 there were plans for a renovation. However, they were shelved upon consideration of the cost of upgrading the building&#x27;s infrastructure. Instead, as of 2019, the city is moving forward with plans for a new library facility along Westheimer Road. The facility will be in the multi-purpose Montrose Collective development which will also have retail. In March 2024, the library system closed the church-based Freed-Montrose, stating that concerns about safety were the reason for the closure. The new Freed-Montrose is scheduled to open in fall 2024.
*Heights Neighborhood Library (Houston Heights)
*David M. Henington-Alief Regional Library (Alief)
*Arnold L. Hillendahl Neighborhood Library (Spring Branch)
*W. L. D. Johnson Neighborhood Library (Sunnyside)
*J. Frank Jungman Neighborhood Library (Uptown)
*Belle Sherman Kendall Neighborhood Library (Memorial)
*Adele Briscoe Looscan Neighborhood Library (River Oaks) - The current building opened in September 2007. The former library, established in 1956, closed on August 27, 2005, and was demolished in February 2006. The previous Looscan branch had around 61,000 visitors in the fiscal year 2005. The original plans for Looscan called for the library to get a $5.4 million renovation. An Upper Kirby group proposed a new site near the Upper Kirby YMCA. Around that period the group Friends of Neighborhood Libraries began raising funds. The replacement library, costing $6.2 million, has twice the staff and two and one half times the size of the previous facility. Friends of Neighborhood Libraries raised one million dollars in four months, and around $2.5 million in total to help fund the new library. The library, designed by Jackson &amp; Ryan Architects, houses over 60,000 books and is the first city LEED-certified facility. It includes a 120-seat multipurpose meeting room and a 14-seat private conference room. The library has several reading areas, including the Marsha Moody Children&#x27;s Reading Room, a teenager reading area, and a periodical reading area. The exterior was designed to match visual cues of buildings in the surrounding area, such as the River Oaks Baptist Church and School. The Emily Scott and Joseph Wood Evans Clock Tower, a part of the library&#x27;s exterior, includes a garden book archive and works of art.
*Frank O. Mancuso Neighborhood Library
*Eva Alice McCrane-Kashmere Gardens Neighborhood Library (Kashmere Gardens)
*John P. McGovern-Stella Link Regional Library (Braeswood Place) - The library, named after physician John P. McGovern, opened on January 8, 2005. The &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; awarded the library a Landmark Award for Community Impact in 2006. In 2007 and 2010 the &quot;Houston Press&quot; ranked the branch the &quot;Best Public Library Branch.&quot; The McGovern Library closed after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017. Its tentative reopening is in 2019.
*Lucile Y. Melcher Neighborhood Library (Pecan Park)
*Nettie Moody Neighborhood Library (Northside)
*Oak Forest Neighborhood Library (Oak Forest)
*Park Place Regional Library (Park Place)
*Pleasantville Neighborhood Library (Pleasantville)
*Elizabeth L. Ring Neighborhood Library (Spring Branch)
*Judson W. Robinson-Westchase Neighborhood Library (Westchase)
*Scenic Woods Regional Library (Scenic Woods)
*Beulah Shepard-Acres Homes Neighborhood Library (Acres Homes)
*Lonnie E. Smith Neighborhood Library (Third Ward)
*Nena Stanaker Neighborhood Library (Magnolia Park)
*Sherman E. Stimley-Blue Ridge Neighborhood Library (Blue Ridge)
*Cliff Tuttle Neighborhood Library (Denver Harbor)
*William A. Vinson Neighborhood Library
*Dr. Shannon Walker Neighborhood Library (Westbury). Its namesake is Shannon Walker and it replaced the Frank and Meyer libraries.
*M. E. Walter Neighborhood Library (Sharpstown)
*Alice McKean Young Neighborhood Library (Palm Center, near South Park)

====Special libraries====
* African American Library at the Gregory School
* Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research
* Houston Metropolitan Research Center

====Former locations====
* Colored Carnegie Library (Opened 1912, became HPL branch in 1921, officially closed on July 31, 1961, demolished 1962 and replaced with an extension of Clay Avenue)
*Morris Frank Library (Fondren Southwest). Replaced by an HPL Express location, which in turn was, in 2023, replaced by the Walker Library.
*George B. Meyer Neighborhood Library (Meyerland/Westbury) - The library opened in 1962. In 1994 the library received renovations to accommodate disabled people. By 2013 HPL planned to purchase land for a new Meyerland branch with $442,000. HPL spokesperson Sandra Fernandez stated that HPL wants to build a new facility in order to increase the size and parking capacity. There is a proposal to move the library to Westbury Square in Westbury, supported by the Westbury community but opposed by Meyerland residents. In 2015 various proposals on where the replacement library should go were being debated. Prior to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Houston community considered the Meyer Branch to be the Houston library in the poorest state of maintenance. Hurricane Harvey gave the library moderate damage, and the city government closed it afterwards, with demolition scheduled. The new library, which will also replace HPL Express Frank, will be at 5505 Belrose on a plot of land in Westbury.
*Lakewood Neighborhood Library (Closed 2017 after Hurricane Harvey)
*Amanda E. Dixon Neighborhood Library (Houston Gardens) (Closed in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey. The old library building was torn down for the new Dixon TechLink.)
*Fifth Ward Neighborhood Library (Fifth Ward)

===Partnership libraries===
In addition, HPL has a partnership with the Harris County Public Library&#x27;s Clear Lake City-County Freeman Branch Library in the Clear Lake City community of Houston.

Also, the Parent Resource Library in the Children&#x27;s Museum of Houston is considered part of the Houston Public Library system; however, its staff are employed by the museum, rather than the City of Houston.

In partnership with the Harris County Public Library, which will operate the branch, the Kingwood Branch in Kingwood is a &quot;City-County&quot; branch in exchange for $4.2 million to fund the building of a new facility. At the time of its completion, the existing branch will be converted into a community center.

<text>Elisha Hunt Rhodes (March 21, 1842 – January 14, 1917) was an American soldier who served in the Union Army of the Potomac for the entire duration of the American Civil War, rising from corporal to colonel of his regiment by war&#x27;s end. Rhodes&#x27; illustrative diary of his war service was quoted prominently in Ken Burns&#x27;s 1990 PBS documentary series &quot;The Civil War&quot;, read by Christopher Murney.

==Early life==
Rhodes was born in Pawtuxet, Rhode Island, to Elisha H. Rhodes and Eliza A. Chase. He had several sisters and two brothers. At age 14, Rhodes attended Potter and Hammond&#x27;s Business Academy in Providence.

His father drowned when his schooner, the merchant ship &quot;Worcester&quot;, was sunk by a hurricane on December 10, 1858. He was buried on Linyards Cay, Abaco in the Bahamas.

==Civil War==

Rhodes served with the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry throughout its service during the American Civil War.

Rhodes enlisted in the war with his mother&#x27;s permission. At first he believed war to be an adventure. During the war, he advanced from corporal to lieutenant colonel in command of the regiment.

He enlisted on June 5, 1861 and was appointed to the rank of corporal. He was promoted to sergeant major on March 1, 1862 and to 2nd lieutenant on July 24 of the same year.

On April 15, 1863 he was promoted to 1st lieutenant and placed in command of Company B. He became the regiment&#x27;s adjutant, with the rank of 1st lieutenant, on November 6, 1863. He served in this capacity until the regiment was reorganized on June 17, 1864.

On June 21, 1864 he was promoted to captain and assigned to Company B but was also ordered to command the regiment, which he did for the remainder of the war. He received a brevet (honorary promotion) to the rank of major on December 5, 1864.

On February 6, 1865 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the regiment. On April 2 he received a brevet to the rank of colonel in recognition of his service in the Petersburg campaign. He was mustered out of service, along with his regiment, on July 13, 1865. 

==Postbellum career==

After the war, he became a successful businessman and became active in veterans&#x27; affairs. He never missed a regimental reunion of the 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry.

He married Caroline Pearce Hunt (1841–1930) on June 12, 1866 and had a son, Frederick Miller Rhodes and a daughter Alice Caroline Rhodes Chace.

He was appointed as collector of U. S. Internal Revenue in Rhode Island in 1875.

From June 25, 1879 until March 21, 1892 he served as the commander of the Brigade of Rhode Island Militia with the rank of brigadier general.

During his time in office General Rhodes helped transform the militia into a more professional organization and established the state training ground at Quonset Point in North Kingstown.

==Memberships==

Rhodes was very active in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), the largest of several organizations for Union veterans. He was Adjutant of Prescott Post, No. 1, in 1867, Commander of the post the next year, Assistant Adjutant General of the Department of Rhode Island in 1871, Commander of the department in 1872–73, member of the National Encampment in 1874–75. He served for one year (1877–78) as the GAR&#x27;s national senior vice commander.

He was also Vice President of the Society of the Army of the Potomac in 1877, and president of the Second Rhode Island Volunteer Association. He was also president of the Rhode Island Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Historical Society since its formation in 1873, and in 1879 was Vice President of the 6th Army Corps Association.

In 1892 he was elected as a companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) — a military society composed of officers who had served in the Union armed forces during the Civil War. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 9476.

An active Freemason, having joined the fraternity while home on leave in 1864, he served as Worshipful Master of Harmony Lodge, No. 9, in Cranston, Rhode Island. He was later elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island for 1892-1893.

==Death and burial==

Rhodes died in Providence on January 14, 1917. He and his wife are buried at the Rhodes family plot in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.

==Legacy==

Elisha Hunt Rhodes is most remembered for his wartime journal and letters published as &quot;All For the Union&quot; by a great-grandson, Robert H. Rhodes. This diary reflects Rhodes&#x27; ideas about the Civil War, including his unwavering belief that the Union must be preserved, as well as his Christian faith and belief in God. At the end it shows a somewhat conflicted young man who wanted to be home with his family after trials of war but who also found life in the Army very agreeable to him. His writings were made famous by their incorporation into filmmaker Ken Burns&#x27; 1990 landmark PBS-TV documentary series &quot;The Civil War&quot;.

His large collection of personal relics and mementos is now owned by the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence.

<text>Perry Park was the home field for the Keokuk Westerns of the National Association during the 1875 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league. The Westerns played their first game against the Chicago White Stockings on May 4, 1875, at Perry Park, which was located in a field beyond Rand Park. They played their last game on June 14, 1875, against the New York Mutuals also at Perry Park.

<text>The Reporter of Decisions (sometimes known by other titles, such as Official Reporter or State Reporter) is the official responsible for publishing the decisions of a court. Traditionally, the decisions were published in books known as case reporters or law reports. In recent years, the reporter&#x27;s duties have been broadened in many jurisdictions to include publication through electronic media.

In the United States, the most prominent Reporter of Decisions is the Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, an officer of the Supreme Court of the United States, responsible for reporting the decisions of that court in the official report volumes, known as the &quot;United States Reports&quot;. In contrast, the United States courts of appeals have not historically appointed official reporters of decisions, relying instead on the private company West Publishing to report appellate decisions in its &quot;Federal Reporter&quot; series.

In many jurisdictions, older collections of case reports are known by the name of the reporter who served during the time when they were collected.

<text>Pierre Gouthière (1732–1813) was a French metal worker. He was born at Bar-sur-Aube and went to Paris at an early age as the pupil of Martin Cour.

During his brilliant career he executed a vast quantity of metal work of the utmost variety, the best of which was unsurpassed by any of his rivals in that great art period. It was long believed that he received many commissions for furniture from the court of Louis XVI, and especially from Marie Antoinette, but recent searches suggest that his work for the queen was confined to bronzes. Gouthière can, however, well bear this loss, nor will his reputation suffer should those critics ultimately be justified who believe that many of the furniture mounts attributed to him were from the hand of Thomire. But if he did not work for the court he unquestionably produced many of the most splendid belongings of the duc d&#x27;Aumont, the duchesse de Mazarin and Madame du Barry. Indeed, the custom of the beautiful mistress of Louis XV brought about the financial ruin of the great artist, who accomplished more than any other man for the fame of her château of Louveciennes.

When the collection of the duc d&#x27;Aumont was sold by auction in Paris in 1782 so many objects niounted by Gouthière were bought for Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette that it is not difficult to perceive the basis of the belief that they were actually made for the court. The duc&#x27;s sale catalogue is, however, in existence, with the names of the purchasers and the prices realized. The auction was almost an apotheosis of Gouthière. The precious lacquer cabinets, the chandeliers and candelabra, the tables and cabinets in marquetry, the columns and vases in porphyry, jasper and choice marbles, the porcelains of China and Japan were nearly all mounted in bronze by him. More than fifty of these pieces bore Gouthière&#x27;s signature.
The duc d&#x27;Aumont&#x27;s cabinet represented the high-water mark of the chasers art, and the great prices which were paid for Gouthière&#x27;s work at this sale are the most conclusive criterion of the value set upon his achievement in his own day. Thus Marie Antoinette paid 12,000 livres for a red jasper bowl or brûle-parfums mounted by him, which was then already famous. Curiously enough it commanded only one-tenth of that price at the Fournier sale in 1831; but in 1865, when the marquis of Hertford bought it at the prince de Beauvais&#x27;s sale, it fetched 31,900 francs. It is now in the Wallace Collection, which contains the finest and most representative gathering of Gouthière&#x27;s undoubted work. The mounts of gilt bronze, cast and elaborately chased, show satyr&#x27;s heads, from which hang festoons of vine leaves, while within the feet a serpent is coiled to spring.

A smaller cup is one of the treasures of the Louvre. There too is a bronze clock, signed by Gouthière, cizileur et doreur du Roy a Paris, dated 1771, with a river god, a water nymph symbolizing the Rhne and its tributary the Durance, and a female figure typifying the city of Avignon. Not all of Gouthière&#x27;s work is of the highest quality, and much of what he executed was from the designs of others. At his best his delicacy, refinement and finish are exceedingly delightfulin his great moments he ranks with the highest alike as artist and as craftsman. The tone of soft dead gold which is found on some of his mounts he is believed to have invented, but indeed the gilding of all his superlative work possesses a remarkable quality. This charm of tone is admirably seen in the bronzes and candelabra which he executed for the chimney-piece of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s boudoir at Fontainebleau.

He continued to embellish Louveciennes for Madame du Barry until the Revolution, and then the guillotine came for her and absolute ruin for him. When her property was seized she owed him 756,000 livres, of which he never received a sol, despite repeated applications to the administrators. &quot;Réduit a solliciter une place à l&#x27;hospice, il mourut dans la misére.&quot; So it was stated in a lawsuit brought by his sons against du Barry&#x27;s heirs.

<doc id="1296779" wikidata="Q7303052" url="?curid=1296779" title="Recreation Park (Detroit)">
<text>Recreation Park was a ballpark located in Detroit, Michigan. It is best known as the home of the Detroit Wolverines of the National League from 1881 to 1888.

Recreation Park was built in 1879. Its developers intended it to be a multi-use facility. There was a half-mile dirt track running along the outside of the property to be used for horse racing, bicycling and foot races. The owners also envisioned use for baseball, cricket, archery, croquet, as well as ice skating in the winter.

Detroit fielded a minor league team that summer. Two years later the Wolverines major league team made its debut. The first major league baseball game in Detroit was played here on May 2, 1881.

As the 1880s progressed, the team improved and won the National League pennant in 1887, as well as the World Series, defeating the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. By the end of the next season, the club was losing money in spite of its successes and dropped out of the league. Minor league ball resumed in 1889 and was played for two seasons (plus one game in 1891) before the club folded altogether. Recreation Park continued to be used for various other activities, but by 1894 it was pretty much abandoned, and the structures were demolished.

The Park was on a rectangular site north of the downtown area, less than a mile from the location of the future Comerica Park. The field was laid out so that the foul lines hit the fences at a 135° angle, similar to the Polo Grounds and various other parks of that era. It was bounded on the south by Brady Street, on the east by Beaubien Street, and on the west by Harper Hospital, beyond which lay John R Street. Brush Street made a T-intersection against Brady at the southwest corner of the lot where the main entrance gate was. For that reason, the location is often given as simply &quot;Brady and Brush Streets.&quot;

Across the centerfield fence, to the north, was the other half of the Recreation Park complex, a cricket field. Contemporary maps depict an oval track around the cricket field, as with the baseball field, and a larger oval enclosing the entire property. The northern boundary of the property, according to initial contemporary newspaper accounts, was Fremont Street (now Canfield Street). Later accounts placed the northern border at Willis Street, a block south of Fremont / Canfield.

Although the ballpark is long gone, Harper Hospital still exists, housed in new buildings, and overlooking the site where the major league Wolverines once played. An historical marker commemorating Recreation Park is placed in what was once left field, among the buildings of the present Detroit Medical Center.

<doc id="1296785" wikidata="Q823839" url="?curid=1296785" title="International Components for Unicode">
<text>International Components for Unicode (ICU) is an open-source project of mature C/C++ and Java libraries for Unicode support, software internationalization, and software globalization. ICU is widely portable to many operating systems and environments. It gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C, C++, and Java software. The ICU project is a technical committee of the Unicode Consortium and sponsored, supported, and used by IBM and many other companies. ICU has been included as a standard component with Microsoft Windows since Windows 10 version 1703.

ICU provides the following services: Unicode text handling, full character properties, and character set conversions; Unicode regular expressions; full Unicode sets; character, word, and line boundaries; language-sensitive collation and searching; normalization, upper and lowercase conversion, and script transliterations; comprehensive locale data and resource bundle architecture via the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR); multiple calendars and time zones; and rule-based formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, currencies, and messages. ICU provided complex text layout service for Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and Thai historically, but that was deprecated in version 54, and was completely removed in version 58 in favor of HarfBuzz.

ICU provides more extensive internationalization facilities than the standard libraries for C and C++. Future ICU 75 planned for April 2024 will require C++17 (up from C++11) or C11 (up from C99), depending on what languages is used. ICU has historically used UTF-16, and still does only for Java; while for C/C++ UTF-8 is supported, including the correct handling of &quot;illegal UTF-8&quot;.

ICU 73.2 has improved significant changes for GB18030-2022 compliance support, i.e. for Chinese (that updated Chinese GB18030 Unicode Transformation Format standard is slightly incompatible); has &quot;a modified character conversion table, mapping some GB18030 characters to Unicode characters that were encoded after GB18030-2005&quot; and has a number of other changes such as improving Japanese and Korean short-text line breaking, and in &quot;English, the name “Türkiye” is now used for the country instead of “Turkey” (the alternate spelling is also available in the data).&quot;

ICU 74 &quot;updates to Unicode 15.1, including new characters, emoji, security mechanisms, and corresponding APIs and implementations. [..]
ICU 74 and CLDR 44 are major releases, including a new version of Unicode and major locale data improvements.&quot; Of the many changes some are for person name formatting, or for improved language support, e.g. for Low German, and there&#x27;s e.g. a new spoof checker API, following the (latest version) Unicode 15.1.0 UTS #39: Unicode Security Mechanism.

==Older version details==
ICU 72 updated to Unicode 15 (and 73.2 to latest 15.1). &quot;In many formatting patterns, ASCII spaces are replaced with Unicode spaces (e.g., a &quot;thin space&quot;).&quot; ICU (ICU4J) now requires Java 8 but &quot;Most of the ICU 72 library code should still work with Java 7 / Android API level 21, but we no longer test with Java 7.&quot; ICU 71 added e.g. phrase-based line breaking for Japanese (earlier methods didn&#x27;t work well for short Japanese text, such as in titles and headings) and support for Hindi written in Latin letters (hi_Latn), also referred to as &quot;Hinglish&quot;. ICU 70 added e.g. support for emoji properties of strings and can now be built and used with C++20 compilers (and &quot;ICU operator==() and operator!=() functions now return bool instead of UBool, as an adjustment for incompatible changes in C++20&quot;), and as of that version the minimum Windows version is Windows 7. ICU 67 handles removal of Great Britain from the EU. ICU 64.2 added support for Unicode 12.1, i.e. the single new symbol for current Japanese Reiwa era (but support for it has also been backported to older ICU versions down to ICU 4.8.2). ICU 58 (with Unicode 9.0 support) is the last version to support older platforms such as Windows XP and Windows Vista. Support for AIX, Solaris and z/OS may also be limited in later versions (i.e. building depends on compiler support).
==Origin and development==
After Taligent became part of IBM in early 1996, Sun Microsystems decided that the new Java language should have better support for internationalization. Since Taligent had experience with such technologies and were close geographically, their Text and International group were asked to contribute the international classes to the Java Development Kit as part of the JDK 1.1 internationalization APIs. A large portion of this code still exists in the and packages. Further internationalization features were added with each later release of Java.

The Java internationalization classes were then ported to C++ and C as part of a library known as ICU4C (&quot;ICU for C&quot;). The ICU project also provides ICU4J (&quot;ICU for Java&quot;), which adds features not present in the standard Java libraries. ICU4C and ICU4J are very similar, though not identical; for example, ICU4C includes a Regular Expression API, while ICU4J does not. Both frameworks have been enhanced over time to support new facilities and new features of Unicode and Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR).

ICU was released as an open-source project in 1999 under the name IBM Classes for Unicode. It was later renamed to International Components For Unicode. In May 2016, the ICU project joined the Unicode consortium as technical committee &quot;ICU-TC&quot;, and the library sources are now distributed under the Unicode license.

==MessageFormat==
A part of ICU is the MessageFormat class, a formatting system that allows for any number of arguments to control the plural form (, ) or more general switch-case-style selection () for things like grammatical gender. These statements can be nested. ICU MessageFormat was created by adding the plural and selection system to an identically-named system in Java SE.

==Alternatives==
An alternative for using ICU with C++, or to using it directly, is to use Boost.Locale, which is a C++ wrapper for ICU (while also allowing other backends). The claim for using it rather than ICU directly is that &quot;is absolutely unfriendly to C++ developers. It ignores popular C++ idioms (the STL, RTTI, exceptions, etc), instead mostly mimicking the Java API.&quot; Another claim, that ICU only supports UTF-16 (and thus a reason to avoid using ICU) is no longer true with ICU now also supporting UTF-8 for C and C++.

<doc id="1296807" wikidata="Q18567" url="?curid=1296807" title="Arnold Gesell">
<text>Arnold Lucius Gesell (21 June 1880 – 29 May 1961) was an American psychologist, pediatrician and professor at Yale University known for his research and contributions to the fields of child hygiene and child development.

== Early life ==
Gesell was born in Alma, Wisconsin, and later wrote an article analyzing his experiences there entitled &quot;The Village of a Thousand Souls&quot;. The eldest of five children, Arnold and his siblings were born to photographer Gerhard Gesell and schoolteacher Christine Giesen. His first experience in observing child development involved watching his younger siblings learn and grow until he graduated from high school in 1896.

After high school, Gesell attended Stevens Point Normal School, where a course taught by Edgar James Swift led Arnold to take an interest in psychology. Gesell worked as a high school teacher briefly before leaving to study at the University of Wisconsin. Later, he studied history under Frederick Jackson Turner and psychology under Joseph Jastrow, receiving a bachelor of philosophy degree from Wisconsin in 1903.

== Career ==
Gesell served as a teacher and high school principal before seeking his psychological doctorate at Clark University, where the university&#x27;s president, G. Stanley Hall, had founded the child study movement. Arnold received his Ph.D. from Clark in 1906.

Gesell worked at several educational facilities in New York City and Wisconsin before obtaining a professorship at the Los Angeles State Normal School, now known as the University of California, Los Angeles. There he met fellow teacher Beatrice Chandler, who would become his wife. They had a daughter and a son, Federal District Judge Gerhard Gesell.

Gesell also spent time at schools for the mentally disabled, including the Vineland Training School in New Jersey. Having developed an interest in the causes and treatment of childhood disabilities, Gesell began studying at the University of Wisconsin Medical School in 1910 to better understand physiology. He accepted a position as assistant professor at Yale University in 1911, where he also continued to study medicine. He developed the Clinic of Child Development there and received his MD in 1915. He was later given a full professorship at Yale.

Gesell also served as the school psychologist for the Connecticut State Board of Education and helped develop classes to help children with disabilities succeed. This historic appointment made Gesell the first school psychologist in the United States. He wrote several books, including &quot;The Preschool Child from the Standpoint of Public Hygiene and Education&quot; in 1923, &quot;The Mental Growth of the Preschool Child&quot; in 1925 (which was also published as a film), and &quot;An Atlas of Infant Behavior&quot; (chronicling typical milestones for certain ages) in 1934. He coauthored with Frances Ilg two childrearing guides, &quot;Infant and Child in the Culture of Today&quot; in 1943 and &quot;The Child from Five to Ten&quot; in 1946.

Gesell made use of the latest technology in his research. He used the newest in video and photography advancements. He also made use of one-way mirrors when observing children, even inventing the Gesell dome, a one-way mirror shaped like a dome under which children could be observed without being disturbed. In his research, he studied many children, including Kamala, a feral child. He also did research on young animals, including monkeys.

As a psychologist, Gesell wrote and spoke about the importance of both nature and nurture in child development. He cautioned others not to be quick to attribute mental disabilities to specific causes. He believed that many aspects of human behavior, such as handedness and temperament, were heritable. He explained that children adapted to their parents as well as to one another. He advocated for a nationwide nursery school system in the United States.

Gesell&#x27;s popular books spread his ideas beyond academia. His core message, urging parents to &quot;nourish the child&#x27;s trustfulness in life&quot;, resonated with child advocates long before Benjamin Spock became America&#x27;s most prominent parental advisor. In &quot;The Child from Five to Ten&quot;, Gesell wrote, &quot;It is no longer trite to say that children are the one remaining hope of mankind... If we could but capture their transparent honesty and sincerities! They still have much to teach us, if we observe closely enough.&quot;

== Maturational theory and developmental schedules ==
Gesell&#x27;s ideas came to be known as Gesell&#x27;s Maturational Theory of child development. Based on his theory, he published a series of summaries of child development sequences, called the Gesell Developmental Schedules.

The Gesell Institute of Human Development, named after him, was started by his colleagues from the Clinic of Child Development, Frances Ilg and Louise Bates Ames in 1950, after Gesell retired from the university in 1948. In 2012, the institute was renamed the Gesell Institute of Child Development.

== Personal ==
In 1911, Gesell married Beatrice Chandler who was a teacher he had met while working at Los Angeles State Normal School. The couple had a daughter and a son. Gesell died at his home in New Haven in 1961.

<text>North-Western Rhodesia, in south-central Africa, was a territory administered from 1891 until 1899 under charter by the British South Africa Company. In 1890 the British South Africa Company signed a treaty with King Lewanika of the Barotse, one of the most powerful traditional rulers in the territory. The treaty did not confer protectorate status on the territory, as only the British government could confer that status. Nonetheless, the charter gave the territory protection. 
The territory consisted of the western half of present-day Zambia up to the Kafue River, which is its border with North-Eastern Rhodesia. Later, the border between the two chartered territories was moved east, but the distinction had no great implications.

In 1899 North-Western Rhodesia was amalgamated with Barotseland to form Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, an official British protectorate. In 1911 Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia was amalgamated with North-Eastern Rhodesia to form Northern Rhodesia. Today, this is the Republic of Zambia.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot; is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in January 1893, and in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States on 14 January 1893. It is the second of twelve stories collected in &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in most British editions of the canon, and the second of the eight stories from &quot;His Last Bow&quot; in most American versions.

==Plot==
Miss Susan Cushing of Croydon receives a parcel in the post that contains two severed human ears packed in coarse salt. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard suspects a prank by three medical students whom Miss Cushing was forced to evict because of their unruly behaviour. The parcel was sent from Belfast, the city of origin of one of the former boarders. Upon examining the parcel himself, Holmes is convinced that it is evidence of a serious crime. He reasons that a medical student with access to a dissection laboratory would likely use something other than plain salt to preserve human remains, and would be able to make a more precise cut than the roughly hacked ears suggest. The address on the package, roughly written and with a spelling correction, suggests to Holmes that the sender lacks education and is unfamiliar with Croydon. The knot in the string suggests to Holmes that they are looking for someone with sailing experience.

Holmes considers the solution so simple that he asks Lestrade not to mention his name in connection with it. A few simple questions to Miss Cushing, a few observations, a cable to Liverpool, and a visit to Miss Cushing&#x27;s sister Sarah (Holmes was denied admittance by the doctor because she was having a &quot;brain fever&quot;) convince Holmes that the ears belong to Miss Cushing&#x27;s other sister, Mary, and her extramarital lover, and that they have been murdered. He is convinced that Mary&#x27;s estranged husband, Jim Browner, is the murderer, and that Browner had sent the cardboard box containing the ears to the Cushings&#x27; house in Croydon (addressing it merely to &quot;S. Cushing&quot;), not realizing that Sarah was no longer resident there. Browner, who is an unpleasant man when drunk, had meant to horrify Sarah (rather than Susan) because he ultimately blamed Sarah for causing the trouble that culminated in his murder of his wife and her lover.

Browner is indeed a sailor, and Belfast was the first port where he had the chance to post the parcel. Lestrade, acting on Holmes&#x27;s information, is waiting to arrest him when his ship reaches London. He confesses everything. He is presented with considerable sympathy, a simple man so tormented by guilt at his act that he would welcome being hanged. The real villain of the story—morally if not legally—is Sarah Cushing, who fell in love with and tried to seduce Browner herself; then, when he rejected her advances, set out to wreck his marriage with her sister Mary, by poisoning her mind to her own husband and by introducing and pushing her onto a new lover, which she easily took to, especially given her husband&#x27;s propensity for getting drunk (and being rather rough when so intoxicated). In the end, her husband&#x27;s inability to accept her betrayal, and sheer jealousy at discovering the affair, causes him to commit what Holmes considers a &quot;crime of passion&quot;.

The story was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 14 January 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in February 1893. In &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, the story included eight illustrations by Sidney Paget. It did not include any illustrations in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

&quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot; was not published in the first British edition of &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, but it was published in the first American edition, though it was quickly removed because of its controversial subject matter. The story was later published again in 1917 in &quot;His Last Bow&quot;. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, while most British editions keep the story in its original place, within the &quot;Memoirs&quot;.

When &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot; was removed from publication, Conan Doyle moved a passage from it that showed Holmes &quot;mind reading&quot; Watson to &quot;The Adventure of the Resident Patient&quot;. (The text of the moved passage runs from &quot;Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa&quot; to &quot;I should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day.&quot;) This passage reveals Dr. Watson to be an avid admirer of Henry Ward Beecher, whose portrait he keeps at his home. The passage seems to have little to do with the mystery but may be a subtle reference to the theme of adultery as Beecher was famously put on trial for the offense in 1875, an event many contemporary readers would have remembered.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
The story was adapted as a short silent film titled &quot;The Cardboard Box&quot; in 1923, as one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. Hilda Anthony played Mary Browner and Johnny Butt played James Browner.

The Granada TV adaptation with Jeremy Brett, televised on 11 April 1994, was generally faithful to the original. In it, Browner was portrayed by Ciaran Hinds.

The &quot;Elementary&quot; episode &quot;Ears to You&quot; is a loose adaptation of this story.

The 2018 HBO Asia/Hulu Japan series &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot; loosely adapts this story as the episode &quot;Stella Maris.&quot;

===Radio===
The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode, which aired on 5 November 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another production of the story aired in September 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.

Meiser also adapted the story for &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; for episodes that aired in January 1940 and August 1943 with Basil Rathbone playing Holmes and Nigel Bruce playing Watson.

The story was adapted for the BBC Light Programme in 1960 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.

&quot;The Cardboard Box&quot; was dramatised by Roger Danes for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson (in the series for &quot;His Last Bow&quot;). It featured Kevin Whately as Browner and Teresa Gallagher as Mary Browner; it also introduced Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade, who had previously been played by Donald Gee.

In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;The Cardboard Box&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

<text>Euskirchen (; Ripuarian: &quot;Öskerche&quot;) is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, capital of the district Euskirchen. While Euskirchen resembles a modern shopping town, it also has a history dating back over 700 years, having been granted town status in 1302. As of December 2007, it had a population of 55,446. Its local football club is called TSC Euskirchen.
==Culture==
Parts of the ancient town wall, and three of its defensive towers, are still standing. Tourists are also attracted to Euskirchen due to the proximity of two large cities, Cologne and Bonn, to the northeast, and the hills of the Eifel region to the south. 
It is also the birthplace of Emil Fischer, born 1852, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1902. The local theatre in The Emil-Fischer-Gymnasium offers a wide variety of cultural events. The City Forum and the Parkhotel Euskirchen also contribute to the town&#x27;s cultural offerings.

The word Euskirchen means &quot;Kirche auf der Aue&quot; (&quot;church on riverside lowland&quot;). The Martinskirche is the oldest church in Euskirchen.

Biggest local sports clubs in Euskirchen are the &quot;TSC Euskirchen&quot;, &quot;LGO Euskirchen/Erftstadt&quot; and &quot;Lauf Club Euskirchen&quot;. Sports facilities are the &quot;Erftstadion&quot;, gym &quot;Ohm-Mirgel&quot;, &quot;Jahnhalle&quot;, &quot;Willi-Maurer-Halle&quot;, gym &quot;Emil-Fischer-Gymnasium&quot;, &quot;Sportanlage&quot; &quot;Im Auel&quot; (since 2021 &quot;Heinz-Flohe-Sportpark&quot;) and gym &quot;Marienschule&quot;.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Euskirchen is twinned with:
* Basingstoke, England, United Kingdom (1986)
* Charleville-Mézières, France (1964)

==Industry and Commerce==
Euskirchen has a diversified and balanced economic structure and can therefore provide jobs for a large catchment area. Euskirchen is a rural town with large, open fields serving agricultural purposes. Sugar beets are widely cultivated, and Euskirchen has been home to a sugar factory (Pfeifer &amp; Langen) since 1879. Until a few decades ago, a further important branch of industry was cloth manufacturing, but this was unable to survive due to competition from large international corporations.

Well-known industrial enterprises (e.g. Procter &amp; Gamble, Miele) are located within the town&#x27;s industrial and commercial sites. These can also offer attractive possibilities to new enterprises. The town&#x27;s central location and good road and rail links to the international transport network are important factors in this context.

The two largest industrial and commercial sites in Euskirchen, accounting for a total of 21,000 jobs between them, are:
* IPAS (&quot;IndustriePark Am Silberberg&quot;) with four million m², of which 3.6 m² million lie within the boundary of the town of Euskirchen 
* EURO-Park (located between Euskirchen and Roitzheim) with 1.5 million m².

At IPAS, in the districts Wüschheim/Großbüllesheim, the consumer goods corporation Procter &amp; Gamble has a production plant as well as a warehouse from which it conducts its logistics operations all over the world. At EURO-Park the German company Nestlé Purina PetCare (pet food) and the &quot;T-Versand&quot; division of Deutsche Telekom have their headquarters, the sugar factory Pfeifer &amp; Langen is based at EURO-Park and the building materials chain Mobau (&quot;Moderner Baubedarf&quot;) – which has now merged into Eurobaustoff – was established.

Immediately adjacent to &quot;Industriepark IPAS&quot; is the &quot;PrimeSite Rhine Region&quot;, an area reserved exclusively for major investors. With a total area of 205 hectares, which is equivalent to about 300 football fields, the &quot;PrimeSite Rhine Region&quot; is the first unbuilt and available industrial and commercial site of this size in North Rhine-Westphalia to date. Around 85 percent (177 hectares) of the site lies within the boundary of the town of Euskirchen, while about 15 percent (28 hectares) belong to the municipality of Weilerswist. The already well developed large area will be reserved up to 2019 for space-intensive large-scale projects in excess of 80 hectares. It is being marketed internationally by the state economic development agency NRW.INVEST.

==Notable people==
* Emil Fischer (1852–1919), chemist, 1902 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry for his work on sugar and purine syntheses

* Karl Eschweiler (1886–1936), a Catholic theologian and religious philosopher
* Willi Graf (1918–1943), member of the resistance group White Rose
* Heinz Flohe (1948–2013), former Germany national football team player (world champion 1974)
* Silke Rottenberg (born 1972), former Germany national football team player
* Bettina Wiegmann (born 1971), former Germany national football team player
* Sonja Fuss (born 1978), former Germany national football team player

<text>Figurines is an indie rock band from Denmark, formed in the mid-1990s. The band released their first EP, &quot;The Detour&quot;, in 2001 and their first full-length album, &quot;Shake a Mountain&quot;, in 2004. The band began to receive national attention in Denmark around the time of the full-length release, and began touring Germany in 2003. Their second full-length, &quot;Skeleton&quot;, was released in 2005 on Danish label Morningside Records and German label Pop-U-Loud, and on US label The Control Group in 2006.

The band began a North American tour after being nominated for a Canadian Music Week Indie award and has since performed at the Indies ceremony, SXSW, KEXP, and in cities in the US, Canada, and Europe. The band has also received positive press from Pitchfork Media, The New York Times, and Spin, among others. Figurines&#x27;s sound has been most often compared to that of Pavement, Modest Mouse, and Built to Spill.

The band released their third record &quot;When the Deer Wore Blue&quot; in 2007 with Chicago-based co-producer/engineer Jeremy Lemos, who has worked with Smog, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Loose Fur, and many other Windy City acts in the past. The new material is more psychedelic than previous efforts, but remains faithful to the melodic-pop sounds of &quot;Skeleton&quot; and &quot;Shake a Mountain&quot; on several tracks, including &quot;Hey, Girl&quot;, the first single from the record. 

In 2010 they released their 4th record titled &quot;Figurines&quot;.

The Figurines were formed in the mid-1990s when Christian Hjelm, Claus Salling Johansen and Andreas Toft all began to &quot;jam&quot; together. Originally all the Figurines guitarists. Eventually Toft switched over to bass and Claus swapped to drums until Kristian Volden joined the band. 

In May 2006, Andreas left the band and Mads Kjærgaard and Mathe Fischer joined. In 2007 Mathe Fischer left the band after a one-year stay, and Jens Ramon joined.

They went to Sweden in &quot;Silence studios&quot; (an analog studio), where they were living separated from normal life, while they were working on their next release &quot;When the Deer Wore Blue&quot; produced by Jeremy Lemos (who later worked with Sonic Youth). After touring they began making songs for their new album.

Then Kristian Volden and Mads Kjærgaard left the Figurines, and band turned into a trio. The trio released &quot;Figurines&quot; in 2010.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;The Air We Breathe&quot; was featured on season 1 episode 13 of the TV-show &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;.

<doc id="1296862" wikidata="Q84938" url="?curid=1296862" title="Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow">
<text>Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, also Ernst Fleischl von Marxow (5 August 1846, Vienna – 22 October 1891, Vienna), was an Austrian physiologist and physician who became known for his important investigations on the electrical activity of nerves and the brain. He was also a creative inventor of new devices which were widely adopted in clinical medicine and physiological research.

He was born as &quot;Ernst Fleischl&quot;, the son of Karl Fleischl (1818–1893) and his wife Ida (née Marx). In 1875, Karl Fleischl was ennobled by Emperor Franz Joseph and granted the hereditary title of &quot;Edler von Marxow&quot; in the Austrian nobility. His son&#x27;s style therefore changed to &quot;Ernst Fleischl Edler von Marxow&quot;, which he usually used in shortened form as &quot;Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow&quot;.

Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow studied medicine in the University of Vienna, Austria. He started his scientific career as a research assistant in the laboratory of Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819–1892), and later as an assistant, in the same university, to the eminent pathologist Carl von Rokitansky (1804–1878). However, an accident while he was dissecting a cadaver injured his thumb, which became infected and had to be amputated, interrupting his activities in anatomical pathology. Thus, he had to turn to physiology, and he came back to von Brücke&#x27;s laboratory in Vienna after studying for a year with Carl Ludwig (1816–1895), another famous physiologist at the University of Leipzig, Germany, obtaining his doctoral degree in medicine in 1874.

In the first phase of his career in neurophysiology, Fleischl-Marxow dedicated himself to electrophysiology of nerves and muscles, then a research field of increasing prestige, after the pioneering investigations of Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896), who had discovered the action potentials of axons. This field highly benefited from the technical developments occurring in the physical sciences, particularly new devices which were invented to work with small electric potentials and currents. Since biological tissues have extremely low levels of electrical activity (in the range of microvolts), neurophysiology&#x27;s progress had to wait for them. Like many German physiologists of his time, Fleischl-Marxow had a good knowledge and ability with physics, and invented a number of devices for the purpose of his studies, particularly the &quot;reonome&quot; (a kind of rheostat, or variable resistor used to control finely the intensity of an electrical stimulus). He also adapted the Lippmann&#x27;s capillary electrometer in order to use it for measuring subtle bioelectrical phenomena.

From the bioelectricity of nerves, Fleischl-Marxow turned his attention, from 1876 on, to the global electrical activity of the cerebral hemispheres. Neuroanatomists had already determined at the time that its nervous tissue was also composed of cells (the neurons), with their bodies mainly located in the gray matter, and filamentary prolongations, the dendrites and the axons. Thus, it was only natural to assume that they would also display electrical activity. This important discovery, however, had not been made until that time, because many desynchronized electrical potentials with different polarities produce a cumulative global potential which is actually very small and difficult to detect with the sensitivity range of the measuring devices available at the time. Despite this, Fleischl-Marxow was able to prove for the first time that the peripheral stimulation of sensory organs, such as vision and hearing were able to provoke event-related small electrical potential swings on the surface of the cerebral cortex which was related to the projection of those senses. Strangely, however, Fleischl-Marxow did not publish his results, choosing instead to deposit them in a bank safe, with instructions to reveal them in 1883 only. Meanwhile, the first publications about what was later to be called the electroencephalogram came to light, independently demonstrated by Richard Caton (1842–1926), in Great Britain, and Adolf Beck (1863–1942) in Poland, both using laboratory animals.

In 1880, Fleischl-Marxow became a full professor at the University of Vienna and was nominated a correspondent member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He also devoted part of his research to physiological optics, making important discoveries on the distribution of the optic nerve on the retina, and the optical characteristics of the cornea. With his increasing knowledge in optical physics, he developed several optical measurement instruments, such as a spectropolarimeter and a hematometer (a device used for measuring the content of hemoglobin in the blood), which was named in his honor, and which for many years found wide application in laboratory medicine and diagnostic hematology.

For many years, Fleischl-Marxow labored under intense personal suffering, due to chronic painful complications of his amputation. Because of this, he became addicted to morphine and heroin (a synthetic derivative of morphine, but much more potent). Sigmund Freud, then a Viennese neurologist, was one of his most intimate friends, and had the highest opinion of him:

At the time Freud was studying the medical properties of cocaine, and was convinced that cocaine could be not only used as mild euphoriant, aphrodisiac and analgesic, but also as a treatment for morphine addicts. He recommended this to his friend Fleischl-Marxow, who proceeded to fall even deeper into the abyss of addiction. Devastated by pain, addiction, and disease, he relapsed and began using morphine again. Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow died on October 22, 1891, at 45 years of age.
Freud talked about him, without citing explicitly his name, in &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, analysing Irma&#x27;s injection.

<text>Mouse Menace is a 1946 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; animated short film directed by Arthur Davis. The short was released on November 2, 1946, and stars Porky Pig.

==Plot==
A persistent mouse incursion into Porky Pig&#x27;s household sets the stage for a series of misadventures. Despite Porky&#x27;s initial attempts to eliminate the mouse proving fruitless, including enlisting the aid of a feline and even a mountain lion, each endeavor ends in calamity.

Undeterred, Porky escalates his efforts by constructing a robotic cat, hoping to outwit the elusive rodent. However, the mouse proves to be a cunning adversary, deploying various traps and tactics to thwart the mechanical feline&#x27;s advances. Despite enduring numerous hazards, including explosions and flamethrowers, the robotic cat valiantly persists in its mission.

Ultimately, the mouse engineers its own explosive countermeasure, obliterating Porky&#x27;s residence in the process. Surprisingly, Porky expresses relief at the apparent resolution of the pest problem, only to be met with the mouse&#x27;s enigmatic reappearance and the cryptic remark, &quot;Shall I tell him?&quot;

<text>A heart rate monitor (HRM) is a personal monitoring device that allows one to measure/display heart rate in real time or record the heart rate for later study. It is largely used to gather heart rate data while performing various types of physical exercise. Measuring electrical heart information is referred to as electrocardiography (ECG or EKG).

Medical heart rate monitoring used in hospitals is usually wired and usually multiple sensors are used. Portable medical units are referred to as a Holter monitor. Consumer heart rate monitors are designed for everyday use and do not use wires to connect.

==History==
Early models consisted of a monitoring box with a set of electrode leads which attached to the chest. The first wireless EKG heart rate monitor was invented in 1977 by Polar Electro as a training aid for the Finnish National Cross Country Ski team. As &quot;intensity training&quot; became a popular concept in athletic circles in the mid-80s, retail sales of wireless personal heart monitors started in 1983.

Modern heart rate monitors commonly use one of two different methods to record heart signals (electrical and optical). Both types of signals can provide the same basic heart rate data, using fully automated algorithms to measure heart rate, such as the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.

ECG (Electrocardiography) sensors measure the bio-potential generated by electrical signals that control the expansion and contraction of heart chambers, typically implemented in medical devices.

PPG (Photoplethysmography) sensors use light-based technology to measure the blood volume controlled by the heart&#x27;s pumping action.

===Electrical===
The electrical monitors consist of two elements: a monitor/transmitter, which is worn on a chest strap, and a receiver. When a heartbeat is detected, a radio signal is transmitted, which the receiver uses to display/determine the current heart rate. This signal can be a simple radio pulse or a unique coded signal from the chest strap (such as Bluetooth, ANT, or other low-power radio links). Newer technology prevents one user&#x27;s receiver from using signals from other nearby transmitters (known as cross-talk interference) or eavesdropping. Note, that the older Polar 5.1 kHz radio transmission technology is usable underwater. Both Bluetooth and Ant+ use the 2.4 GHz radio band, which cannot send signals underwater.

===Optical===

More recent devices use optics to measure heart rate by shining light from an LED through the skin and measuring how it scatters off blood vessels. In addition to measuring the heart rate, some devices using this technology are able to measure blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Some recent optical sensors can also transmit data as mentioned above.

Newer devices such as cell phones or watches can be used to display and/or collect the information. Some devices can simultaneously monitor heart rate, oxygen saturation, and other parameters. These may include sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to detect speed, location and distance. In recent years, it has been common for smartwatches to include heart rate monitors, which has greatly increased in popularity. Some smartwatches, smart bands and cell phones often use PPG sensors.

===Fitness metrics===
Garmin (Venu Sq 2 and Lily*), Polar Electro (Polar H9, Polar H10, and Polar Verity Sense), Suunto, Samsung Galaxy Watch (Galaxy Watch 5 and Galaxy Watch 6*), Google (Pixel Watch 2*), Spade and Company, Vital Fitness Tracker**, Apple Watch (Series 7**, Series 9*, Apple Watch SE*, Apple Watch Ultra 2*), Mobvoi (TicWatch Pro 5*) and Fitbit (Versa 3** and Versa 4*) are vendors selling consumer heart rate products. Most companies use their own proprietary heart rate algorithms.

==Accuracy==
The newer, wrist based heart rate monitors have achieved almost identical levels of accuracy as their chest strap counterparts with independent tests showing up to 95% accuracy, but sometimes more than 30% error can persist for several minutes. Optical devices can be less accurate when used during vigorous activity, or when used underwater.

Currently, heart rate variability is less available on optical devices. Apple introduced HRV data collection to the Apple Watch devices in 2018. Fitbit started offering HRV monitoring on their devices starting from the Fitbit Sense, released in 2020.

<doc id="1296865" wikidata="Q332457" url="?curid=1296865" title="Léon Gozlan">
<text>Léon Gozlan (11 September 1803 – 14 September 1866) was a 19th-century French novelist and playwright.

==Life==
When he was still a boy, his father, who had made a large fortune as a ship-broker, met with a series of misfortunes, and Léon, before completing his education, had to go to sea in order to earn a living. In 1828 we find him in Paris, determined to run the risks of literary life. His townsman, Joseph Méry, who was then making himself famous by his political satires, introduced him to several newspapers, and Gozlan&#x27;s brilliant articles in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; did much harm to the already tottering government of Charles X.

He was made a member of the Legion of Honour in 1846, and in 1859 an officer of that order. He died on 14 September 1866 in Paris, and was buried at Montmartre Cemetery

== Works ==

His first published works were:

*1820: &quot;les Émotions de Polydore Marasquin&quot;, edition : H. Laurens (Paris) (160 p.-4 f. de pl. en coul. : ill. ; in-16) 
** (undated) edition: F. Rouff (Paris) (32 p. : couv. ill. en coul. ; gr. in-8) 
*1825: &quot;Plus joyeuses aventures d&#x27;Aristide Froissard&quot;, edition : F. Rouff (Paris) (48 pages)

His first novel was:

*1828: &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un apothicaire sur la Guerre d&#x27;Espagne, pendant les années 1808 à 1814&quot;, with: Sébastien Blaze(1785-184.), edition: Ladvocat (Paris)(2 vol. 447, 400 p.; 22 cm),″

This novel was followed by many others, including:

*1834: &quot;Les Intimes&quot;, (3 vol.), published under the pseudonym &quot;Michel Raymond&quot;, with Raymond Brucker, Paris, Eugène Renduel,
::Michel Raymond, was a pseudonym, first used for a book written by Michel Masson and Raymond Brucker: &quot;Le Maçon, mœurs populaires&quot;, (4 vol.) This book was received with great praise of the critics. The pseudonym used was the conjunction of the first names of these two men. In cooperation with Léon Gozlan Raymond Brucker wrote the novel &quot;Les Intimes&quot;. It was published in 1834 under the same pseudonym &quot;Michel Raymond&quot;, in an attempt to ride on the success of this name. Although he never protested, after this Michel Masson stopped all cooperation with Raymond Brucker.

He adapted several of his own novels to the stage. Gozlan also wrote a romantic and picturesque description of the old manors and mansions of his country entitled &quot;Les Châteaux de France&quot; (2 vols, 1844), originally published (1836) as &quot;Les Tourelles&quot;, which has some archaeological value, and a biographical essay on Balzac (&quot;Balzac chez lui&quot;, 1862).

<text>Red Stocking Base-Ball Park was a baseball grounds in St. Louis, Missouri. It was home to the St. Louis Red Stockings of the National Association (NA) during the 1875 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league.

The site is first known to have been used for baseball in about 1867, when it was the home of something called the Veto Club, and was called the Veto Grounds. The grounds were evidently already well-known, as local newspapers in 1867 were calling it the &quot;old&quot; Veto Grounds. In 1874, the Red Stockings—then a local amateur club—built a grandstand behind home plate and a wooden stockade fence around the field. &quot;The diamond lay near the southeast corner of the lot, home plate facing northwest,&quot; wrote Joan M. Thomas for the Society for American Baseball Research.

The venue was also known as Compton Avenue Baseball Park or just Compton Park, as it was bordered by South Compton Avenue (east, first base). Its other boundaries were railroad tracks (south, third base); Edwin Street and Theresa Avenue (west, left field); Spruce Street (north, right field); and with Scott Avenue and Gratiot Street T-ing into Compton from the east. In 1892, a new fence and additional seats were installed.

The park was used as a baseball venue off-and-on until it was razed in the late 1890s. It also hosted other local sports, including trap shooting and bicycle racing.

The site is currently occupied by Metro Transit&#x27;s Central Facility.

==Historical marker==
On September 13, 2008, a historical marker noting the site&#x27;s history was unveiled by the Bob Broeg Chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research. The marker was financed with funds by the SABR Chapter Ballpark Marker Committee. Local papers reported that the plaque would be installed, with the permission of the Bi-State Development Agency, at the entrance of the Metro garage that now occupies the site. The marker is on the southeast corner of Spruce Street and the entry driveway which is about 200 feet east of where Edwin Street tees into Spruce.

<text>Vijay Samuel Hazare (11 March 1915 – 18 December 2004) was an Indian cricketer. He captained India in 14 matches between 1951 and 1953. In India&#x27;s 25th Test match, nearly 20 years after India achieved Test status, he led India to its first Test cricket win (and the only victory under his captaincy) in 1951–52 against England at Madras, winning by an innings and eight runs in a match that began on the day that King George VI died. He received the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, the highest honour bestowed by BCCI on a former player.

== Early life ==

Hazare was born in Sangli, into Marathi Christian family, in the then Bombay Presidency of British India in 1916, one of eight children of a school teacher.

== Career ==
Primarily a right-hand batsman, Hazare was also a right-hand medium-pace bowler. A &quot;shy, retiring&quot; man (according to &quot;Wisden&quot; in 1952), it was widely thought that he was not a natural captain and that his batting suffered as a result. His rival, Vijay Merchant said that the captaincy prevented Hazare from becoming India&#x27;s finest batsman: &quot;It was one of the tragedies of cricket.&quot;

Even so, Hazare&#x27;s Test record is very respectable: he amassed 2,192 runs in 30 Test matches with a batting average of 47.65. His first-class record is even more impressive, with a batting average of 58.38 for his 18,740 runs. He scored 60 first-class centuries (including 7 in Tests), the fourth highest for an Indian player and 10 first-class double centuries (including six during World War II, when India was the only Test cricket-playing country to continue holding its domestic first-class cricket competition without interruption).

His bowling record was more modest, and he took 595 first-class wickets (including 19 in Tests, and Donald Bradman&#x27;s wicket three times) at a bowling average of 24.61. On the Indian domestic circuit, Hazare played for the Maharashtra, Central India and Baroda teams.

Some of his notable achievements include:
*First Indian batsman to score a triple century in first-class cricket (considering KS Duleepsinhji as an English cricketer)
*First Indian to score two triple centuries:
**the first, his highest score, was 316 not out for Maharashtra against Poona in 1939–40
**the second was 309 out of 387 for The Rest against The Hindus at Bombay in 1943–44. Despite his innings, The Rest lost the match by an innings.

<doc id="1296905" wikidata="Q2919856" url="?curid=1296905" title="A Tale of Two Kitties">
<text>A Tale of Two Kitties is a 1942 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Bob Clampett, and was released on November 21, 1942.

The short features the debut of Tweety, originally named Orson until his second cartoon, who delivers the line that would become his catchphrase: &quot;I tawt I taw a puddy tat!&quot;

==Plot==
Two cats, Babbit and Catstello, are looking for food to alleviate their hunger. Babbit gets a ladder when they see a bird (Tweety) on top of a frail tree. Catstello is at first reluctant, but manages to go up the ladder. As Babbit demands his partner to &quot;bring [him] the boid&quot;, Catstello experiences acrophobia and falls down the ladder after failing to catch Tweety from his nest. Babbit then puts Catstello in the following attempts to catch the bird to only end in vain:

# First he tries to launch Babbit in the air with the use of jack-in-the-box springs. When Tweety first encounters Castello, he speaks to the audience in surprise (&quot;I tawt I taw a putty tat!&quot;) before violently attacking him, culminating in him blowing the cat up with a stick of dynamite.
# Babbit&#x27;s next plan is to send the demotivated Catstello up the tree with the use of a TNT barrel. However, Catstello careens off course and crashes onto the roof of a farmhouse before hanging upside down on a wire. Tweety then plays &quot;This little pitty&quot; with his foot, causing him to fall. He attempts &quot;save&quot; the cat by giving him a rope tied to an anvil, which falls off the roof and crash lands onto Catsello deep into the ground.
# Finally, Babbit constructs a makeshift glider for Castello that he can use to swoop down and catch the bird, but Tweety reports this as an air raid, and Catstello is shot down. Catsello&#x27;s descent jump cuts between him and the view of a pitchfork, alluding to his potential fate. But Catstello halts himself midair in the nick of time and safely lands on Babbit.

Tweety walks by acting as an air raid warden and demanding a &quot;total bwackout&quot;, and just as Babbit and Catstello are about to catch him, the bird screams at the cats to turn out the lights.

== Notes ==

* The short is notably the first cartoon to feature the character Tweety, who would later appear in a series of shorts paired with Friz Freleng&#x27;s Sylvester the Cat. 
** Tweety was originally referred to as &quot;Orson&quot; during the production of this cartoon, and was depicted as an aggressive baby bird in his first three appearances rather than the timid yellow canary he&#x27;s better known as. According to Bob Clampett, Tweety&#x27;s initial design was based on the directors baby pictures, and that his characterization was based on Red Skelton&#x27;s character &quot;Junior the Mean Widdle Kid.&quot;
*** Tweety&#x27;s design was previously used for different baby bird in one of Clampett&#x27;s previous shorts, Wacky Blackout (1942).
* The short is also the first to feature the characters Babbit and Catstello, based on the real-life comedic duo Abbott and Costello. Babbit and Catstello would later reappear in three more cartoons without Tweety, those being Tale of Two Mice (1945), Hollywood Canine Canteen (1946) and The Mouse-Merized Cat (1946). These subsequent appearances have the characters portrayed as mice instead, and in one occasion as dogs.
*The cartoon contains a notable jab at the movie industry&#x27;s self-censorship bureau. When Babbit demands Catstello to bring him the bird, Catstello breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience &quot;If the Hays Office would only let me, I&#x27;d give him the &#x27;boid,&#x27; all right!&quot;, which is a not so subtle reference to the middle finger.
* The short was reissued as a Blue Ribbon cartoon on July 31, 1948. This cartoon is also currently in the public domain as United Artists did not renew its copyright in 1970.

<text>Rains is an American rock band from Fort Wayne, Indiana. Formed in 2000, the band was named after founder and leader Jeff Rains. The band has released two studio albums and one EP as of 2019.

==History==
Hailing from a small town in northern Indiana (U.S.A.), Jeff RAINS understands the meaning of hard work, struggles, and life&#x27;s challenges. The talented artist is driven, serious, and committed to his beautiful young family and his musical career.

Featuring Joe Schultz on drums, Matt Hopkins on bass, and Jason Anderson on guitar, RAINS commands the stage with a powerful sound and raw emotion that draws the audience in from the first phrase. RAINS is a band for the people, and, it&#x27;s about time. People need a band to get behind, and, a band to believe in; they need a band that can make them proud. Nothing trendy – something real.

Stories, the debut album from RAINS, offers a window into the heart and soul of “the American Dream.” The expressive lyrics reveal that Jeff Rains is wise beyond his years, a keen observer of life and human behavior. The first single, &quot;Liar&quot;, was a Top 15 hit on SiriusXM Octane, with the follow-up singles “Look In My Eyes” and “Pressure” hitting #3 and #1 on SiriusXM Octane and charted in the top 30 on Active Rock Radio. The album has garnered over 20 million streams on Spotify, as well as millions of streams and views on platforms such as YouTube and iTunes.

After 8 years of constant touring with bands such as Five Finger Death Punch and Black Stone Cherry as well as numerous headlining tours, Rains decided to take some time off to focus on his daughter and his tattoo company, as well as begin the writing process for his new album.

Since starting the project at age 15 Rains has been committed to staying an independent artist throughout his career and has stuck to that philosophy with his latest release N.F.D.M.

Rains began recording his new album N.F.D.M at House Of Blues Studios in Nashville TN in March 2019 and released the first single “Ghost” on December 6, 2019. Rains is a multi-instrumentalist and visionary, whose talent is evident with each new album.

Rains will be touring in support of “Ghost” in early 2020.

<text>Samut Sakhon (, , Pronunciation) is a city in Thailand; it is the capital of Samut Sakhon province. It is a stop on the Maeklong Railway. Samut Sakhon is 48 km from Bangkok.
It is part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region.

==Name==
Samut Sakhon was formerly called Tha Chin (Chinese Pier) probably because, in the old days, it had been a trading port for a vast number of Chinese junks. In 1548, a city named Sakhon Buri was established at the mouth of the Tha Chin River. It was a center for recruiting troops from various seaside towns. The name of the city was changed to Mahachai when Khlong (canal) Mahachai was dug in 1704 to connect the Tha Chin River to the city. Later, the city was renamed Samut Sakhon by King Rama IV but it is still popularly called Mahachai by its residents.

<doc id="1296925" wikidata="Q7332862" url="?curid=1296925" title="Ridgewood Park (baseball ground)">
<text>Ridgewood Park, also known as Wallace&#x27;s Ridgewood Park or the Wallace Grounds, and frequently confused with Grauer&#x27;s Ridgewood Park, was a baseball ground in Ridgewood, Queens, New York. Both Wallace&#x27;s and Grauer&#x27;s are shown in Belcher Hyde&#x27;s Map of Newtown in 1915. The baseball field was part of a larger entertainment area bounded Wyckoff Avenue, Covert Street, Halsey Street, and Irving Avenue. (Halsey Street also bordered the old Capitoline Grounds about west.) The baseball field was southwest of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Montauk Branch tracks (now a dumpster alley and parking lot between Wyckoff and Irving). Eldert Street, although depicted on the map as running through the baseball grounds, was not cut through southwest of the railroad tracks and the road remains interrupted there today. Originally the park was in Queens County, before its incorporation into New York City in 1899. This facilitated Sunday baseball playing, including the charging of admission, beyond the reach of Sabbath enforcers from the then-city of Brooklyn.

Grauer&#x27;s Ridgewood Park or Grauer&#x27;s Woods was a large parkland several blocks north of Wallace&#x27;s ballpark, bounded by Myrtle Avenue, Cypress Avenue, Seneca Avenue, and Decatur Street. Although some baseball was played here, this area was more of a picnic park. George Schubel in 1913 lyrically describes the pleasures of Grauer&#x27;s Ridgewood Park: &quot;Here the German families of another generation assembled and enjoyed themselves in innocent recreation very much in the manner that they were accustomed to do across the seas. Most of these parks have been eliminated, owing to the increase in land values and the decline of this sort of amusement.&quot; He also notes that &quot;This once beautiful park is now cut up with such streets as Centre Street, George Street, Norman Street, Summerfield Street, and Willow Street, running through the land.&quot;

The land that would become Wallace&#x27;s Ridgewood Park was purchased by William Wallace in 1884. On April 5, 1885, the first game was played between the Brooklyn Atlantics and the Ridgewoods before a reported 3,000 fans. According to Retrosheet, Ridgewood Park was used by the Brooklyn Grays / Bridegrooms from 1887–1889 after they had played some games in the 1886 season at Grauer&#x27;s. The Dodgers had used it strictly for Sunday games, to get around Brooklyn&#x27;s blue laws. The Brooklyn Gladiators played their full 1890 schedule at Wallace&#x27;s. The field was home to the semipro Ridgewoods; later the Brooklyn Bushwicks and the Negro league Brooklyn Royal Giants also played there. The park had a capacity of 10,000 in 1887.

On September 19, 1917, the grandstand burned, precipitating the Bushwicks&#x27; move to Dexter Park in 1918. Wallace apparently intended to subdivide the land put it up for sale in that year, but ultimately he would rebuild, and the property was not sold until 1927. Although it was gradually reduced in size, the park survived and hosted soccer and other sports as Grand Stadium until 1959, when it was replaced by industrial buildings.

Grand Stadium once again played host to the Dodgers as a training site in its waning years. The Eagle reported on February 26, 1947, that Branch Rickey &quot;looked refreshed on his arrival at Grand Stadium to watch the 20 who had been tempted [by Mexican promoter Pasquel&#x27;s contract offers] and 30 other Dodgers go through their long drill.&quot; Although this passing reference does not conclusively establish the connection, it seems that the Dodgers returned briefly to their old stomping grounds some 60 years later.

Yet another Ridgewood ballpark was Meyerrose Park, which existed from 1907 through 1911. It was the home of an &quot;outlaw&quot; Brooklyn club for two seasons, in the Atlantic League (1907) and Union League (1908). It was on part of the former Meyerrose Farm, a large block bounded by Myrtle Avenue, Gates Avenue, Covert (now Seneca) Avenue, and Woodward Avenue. After the 1911 season, it was sold to developers, and Onderdonk Avenue was cut through.

<doc id="1296931" wikidata="Q887125" url="?curid=1296931" title="Albert Rosellini">
<text>Albert Dean Rosellini (January 21, 1910 – October 10, 2011) was an American politician who served as the 15th governor of Washington from 1957 to 1965 and was both the first Italian-American and Roman Catholic governor elected west of the Mississippi River.

During a political career that spanned 40 years, Rosellini was an activist leader who worked to reform the state&#x27;s prisons and mental health facilities, expand the state highway system, create the University of Washington&#x27;s medical and dental schools, and build the second floating bridge across Lake Washington.

Rosellini holds the record as the longest-lived U.S. state governor in American history, having reached the age of .

==Early life and education==
Born in Tacoma, Washington, Rosellini was the only son of Italian immigrants, Annunziata (Pagni) and Giovanni Rosellini, a saloon operator. He worked his way through college and law school at the University of Washington, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, graduating in 1933 with his classmate Hugh J. Rosellini (no relation), a childhood friend and later state Supreme Court justice.

==Career==
===Washington Senate===
At the age of 29, Rosellini was elected to the state senate as its youngest member, representing the 33rd district in south Seattle, the home of many Italian immigrants. A New Deal Democrat, Rosellini served from 1939 to 1957, and rose to the rank of majority leader. He was elected governor in 1956.

===Governorship===
As governor, Rosellini coupled personal charm with decades of political know-how, developing a reputation for decisiveness and ability to move ahead on long-stalled projects. Don Hannula, longtime political columnist for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, wrote in 1996, &quot;He was not a man of empty rhetoric. He got things done. His legacy is everywhere.&quot; In his 1997 biography, &quot;Rosellini, Immigrant&#x27;s Son and Progressive Governor&quot;, author Payton Smith wrote: &quot;He was attracted to issues where progress could be made and measured . . . Budget reform, economic development, transportation, higher education and institutions were the core matters to which he devoted his talent and governmental know-how.&quot;

Rosellini was narrowly re-elected in 1960, beating Republican Lloyd J. Andrews by 17,865 votes.

In order to promote economic development, Rosellini established a state department of commerce and championed the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair in 1962.

He shepherded construction of the former longest floating bridge in the world, the original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, which opened in 1963 and carried State Route 520 over Lake Washington from Seattle to Medina. It was renamed for Rosellini in 1988. After 53 years of service, it was replaced by a new floating bridge at the same site in 2016, which also bears his name. In addition, he was a tireless supporter of higher education, strengthening the state university system and developing a system of junior colleges. During his time in office, Rosellini also reformed the state budget process and balanced the budget.

===1964 gubernatorial election===
Rosellini was defeated in his bid for a third term in 1964 by Republican Daniel J. Evans, a state legislator and civil engineer. Rosellini entered the primary unopposed by his ostensive rivals for the Democratic nomination, Lieutenant Governor John Cherberg or Attorney General John J. O&#x27;Connell, but did encounter opposition from several unknown candidates who collectively garnered close to 50,000 votes.

The general election campaign was marked by bruising attacks on the candidate&#x27;s integrity from both the Republican and Democratic camps. Governor Rosellini attempted to portray Evans as a supporter of Barry Goldwater and his record as antithetical to the interests of labor, welfare, and education. Evans in turn charged Rosellini with financial impropriety and cronyism, alleging that the Governor solicited campaign funds from businesses under contract with the state government. Only one televised debate was agreed between the two candidates. The coattails of President Johnson did not extend to this race, as the 39-year-old Evans won by 148,564 votes.

===1972 attempted comeback===
Rosellini made a comeback bid eight years later in 1972; he captured the Democratic nomination, but was again defeated by Evans. Starting with a lead in the polls, Rosellini saw his support fall when he disparagingly referred to Governor Evans as &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and being accused of intervening on behalf of his friend Frank Colacurcio to obtain a club license in Hawaii while in office. A minority of Evans&#x27; supporters also began to sport bumper stickers on the back of their cars stating &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need A Godfather,&quot; described by his daughter Lynn Rosellini as extremely hurtful to her father given his pride over his Italian ancestry. (The popular Oscar-winning film &quot;The Godfather&quot; was released earlier that year.) Rosellini would later state his belief that the attack contributed to his loss, saying &quot;That mafia crap really hurt, overnight I dropped 12 percent in the ratings. I don&#x27;t think people believe it so much as it scared the hell out of them.&quot;

===Consultant and elder statesman===
After leaving office in 1965, Rosellini returned to the practice of law, and also became a political consultant, specializing in matters of the liquor and entertainment industries. Over the years, Rossellini served as an elder statesman of the state Democratic Party, mentoring political figures including Washington governors Christine Gregoire and Gary Locke.

In 2003, Rosellini was back in the news briefly when he was reported to have delivered campaign contributions to Seattle City Council members on behalf of strip-club owners, one of whom was a convicted racketeer. Rosellini was never charged in the scandal that became known as &quot;Strippergate.&quot;

Until his death, Rosellini attended fundraisers for candidates and helped raise money for charities, particularly the Washington State Olympics Committee, which he chaired for many years.

Danny Westneat, columnist for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, wrote in 2005, &quot;His record makes most governors after him look like slackers.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Rosellini and his wife Ethel (1912–2002), whom he married in 1937, had five children. Ethel died in 2002, after 64 years of marriage. Albert and Ethel had a close, affectionate, and happy marriage, and the two were known for their devotion to each other. Rosellini was a practicing Catholic.

==Later life and death==
Rosellini celebrated his 100th birthday in January 2010, becoming one of the few U.S. state governors ever to reach the age of 100. He died of complications related to pneumonia in Seattle on October 10, 2011, at the age of 101. Rosellini&#x27;s funeral was at St. James Cathedral in Seattle, 
and he was buried at Calvary Cemetery, alongside his wife.

<text>Life with Feathers is a 1945 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated short film directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on March 24, 1945, and is the first cartoon to feature Sylvester the Cat.

==Plot==
A lovebird named Sweetypuss experiences a tumultuous turn of events when his spouse evicts him from their shared birdcage, prompting him to contemplate suicide. Convinced that his fate lies in the jaws of a cat, Sweetypuss strategically positions himself near Sylvester the Cat, hoping for a swift demise. However, Sylvester&#x27;s hesitation, stemming from suspicions of Sweetypuss being poisonous, thwarts the avian&#x27;s initial plan.

Undeterred, Sweetypuss resorts to inventive schemes, including mailing for a mallet to propel himself into Sylvester&#x27;s mouth. Yet, the cat&#x27;s resourcefulness prevails, as he smokes a pipe to dissuade Sweetypuss and ensnares him in a bottle. A comedic interlude ensues as Sylvester unwittingly ingests one of Sweetypuss&#x27;s feathers, mistaking it for food, and subsequently perceives himself to be poisoned. Through acts of altruism, Sweetypuss administers an antidote, only to be rebuffed by Sylvester&#x27;s rejection and subsequent banishment.

Further attempts at self-sacrifice, such as masquerading as Santa Claus and leveraging auditory stimuli, fail to elicit the desired response from Sylvester. The lovebird&#x27;s fortunes gradually oscillate, with the imminent threat of consumption by Sylvester momentarily alleviated by news of his wife&#x27;s reconciliation. Nevertheless, Sylvester&#x27;s unyielding pursuit prompts Sweetypuss&#x27;s hasty retreat to the safety of his birdcage.

==Cast==
* Mel Blanc as Cat, Lovebird, Telegram Guy
* Sara Berner as Sweetypuss, Housewife
* Dave Barry as Radio Announcer

==Production notes==
&quot;Life with Feathers&quot; marks the debut of Sylvester the Cat, who would later star in 102 additional shorts. The cartoon earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. It was re-released as part of the Blue Ribbon &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; program on March 3, 1951, retaining its original closing bullet titles.

The title is a play on the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway, &quot;Life with Father&quot; (the title being the only connection between the two works). Warner Bros. would produce a film version in 1947.

It was notably the final cartoon to feature the 1941–45 opening rendition of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; and the last non-Bugs Bunny cartoon to include the &quot;Warner Bros. Pictures Inc.&quot; and &quot;Present&quot; fade-in after the WB shield zooms in. In 1951, Chuck Jones recycled a similar concept for Hubie &amp; Bertie&#x27;s last cartoon, &quot;Cheese Chasers&quot;. The American and European Turner &quot;dubbed versions&quot; depict Sylvester with black fur, though the restored version on Blu-ray Disc/DVD reveals his original lighter bluish-black fur. Scenes from the cartoon were reused in &quot;Kit For Cat&quot;, &quot;Tweety&#x27;s S.O.S.&quot;, and &quot;Catch as Cats Can&quot;.

<text>Birkenfeld () is a town and the district seat of the Birkenfeld district in southwest Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is also the seat of the like-named &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot;. The town itself has approximately 7,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==

===Location===
The town lies in the Nahegebiet (Nahe area), to the north of the namesake river, on the edge of the &quot;Naturpark Saar-Hunsrück&quot;. Birkenfeld lies roughly 13 km southwest of Idar-Oberstein and 12 km northwest of Baumholder.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Clockwise from the north, these are Gollenberg, Elchweiler, Schmißberg, Rimsberg, Dienstweiler, Ellweiler, Dambach, Brücken, Buhlenberg and Ellenberg.

==History==
The name Birkenfeld has its origin in an old German dialect, Old Frankish. It means something rather like &quot;at the field with the birches&quot; (it is directly cognate with the English words &quot;birch field&quot;). From the name&#x27;s Frankish roots it can be inferred that today&#x27;s town arose on a spot where there was quite a noticeable stand of birch trees sometime about the year AD 500, and that it was founded by Frankish-German farmers. To this day, there are a great number of birch trees in the bird conservation area at the clay quarries.

The first attestation of the name is spelled &quot;Bikenuelt&quot; (about 700) or &quot;Birkinvelt&quot; at the time when it had a documentary mention from Archbishop of Trier Egbert in 981. From this document comes knowledge that Saint Leudwinus (Archbishop of Trier 695-713) had donated to the St. Paulinus&#x27; Abbey in Trier the churches at Birkenfeld and Brombach.

Archaeological finds from the Iron Age, however, bear witness to quite heavy settlement even in the 8th century BC. In the 1st century BC, Roman legions overran the area, and for 400 years, it lay under Roman rule. This is known mainly from finds made in the town&#x27;s immediate vicinity. The town that is now Birkenfeld lies right on a Roman road that served as a crosslink between two important military roads, namely the Metz-Mainz road to the south and the Trier-Bingen-Mainz road to the north, which was mentioned by Roman poet Ausonius in his &quot;Mosella&quot; in AD 350, and which also corresponds along some stretches with the (&quot;Hunsrück Heights Road&quot;, a scenic road across the Hunsrück built originally as a military road on Hermann Göring&#x27;s orders). This crosslink, also known as the (&quot;Bronze Road&quot;), linked the Glan, Nohen and the Moselle with each other. The crossed the Nahe in Nohen (&quot;villa Aldena&quot;) and ran farther on, right through the , a state forest that still stands today on the town&#x27;s outskirts, by way of Gollenberg, by Börfink and on towards Trier.

The Frankish settlement of &quot;Birkinvelt&quot; was held in the 13th century by the Counts of Sponheim. In 1223, the county was split into the &quot;Front&quot; and &quot;Rear&quot; Counties of Sponheim, and Birkenfeld passed to the latter, and was then held by the counts whose seat was at the Starkenburg (castle, now a ruin) near Trarbach. In 1293, Castle Birkenfeld had its first documentary mention. In 1332, Birkenfeld was granted town rights by Emperor Louis the Bavarian.

After the last Count of Sponheim died in 1437, the &quot;Rear&quot; County was inherited by the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz. In 1584, a House of Wittelsbach sideline, in the person of Charles I, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld, resided in town. In this same year, expansion work also began on the castle to turn it into a princely residence in the Renaissance style. Exactly 140 years later, the last remnants of the Princely holding of court at Schloss Birkenfeld, as it had come to be known, were swept away. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), the town itself became in 1635 a theatre of war. Also that year, the Plague broke out in Birkenfeld and claimed 416 lives.

In 1776, under Margrave Karl Friedrich, Birkenfeld became seat of the Badish . In this time, Birkenfeld blossomed. The town experienced an economic and cultural upswing. In 1779, for instance, the first &quot;Higher School&quot; was founded.

One night in February 1797, Johannes Bückler, known as Schinderhannes, burgled a cloth factory owned by the Brothers Stumm, who would later become coal and steel entrepreneurs on the Saar. A large part of the cloth stolen during this break-in Schinderhannes sold to a fence in Hundheim.

In 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the Left Bank of the Rhine was ceded to France, whereafter Birkenfeld belonged to the Department of Sarre.

After the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) which ended the Napoleonic Wars, most of the Left Bank became part of Prussian Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine (Rhine Province after 1822), the Bavarian Circle of the Rhine or the Hessian Rhenish Hesse. However, a small area between the Prussian and Bavarian parts was given as exclaves to three other states: the Principality of Lichtenberg went to Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (Saxe-Coburg and Gotha after 1826), Meisenheim went to Hesse-Hanau and the Principality of Birkenfeld was awarded to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg for the contribution of Peter I, then regent of Oldenburg, to the military effort against Napoleon. By 1866 Birknefeld had become entirely enclaved within the Prussian Rhine Province, as Lichtenberg had been sold to Prussia in 1834 and Meisenheim had been annexed following the Austro-Prussian War.

Under Oldenburg rule, the new palatial castle, which is now the district administration&#x27;s seat, was built in 1821. Not only was this built, but so were further buildings in the Governmental Quarter (), such as the infantry barracks (until 1963, a Gymnasium building, now the local office for the regulation of expenditures caused by stationed forces), which to this day characterize the town&#x27;s appearance with their Classicist style from Oldenburg times.

On 1 April 1937, during the Nazi period, the Birkenfeld region was transferred to the Prussian Rhine Province; it was merged with the (roughly &quot;remnant district&quot;) of St. Wendel-Baumholder to form the Birkenfeld District. (The of St. Wendel-Baumholder was what had been the Principality of Lichtenberg until 1834, with the designation as a having arisen after part of its territory, including St. Wendel itself, had been detached to form part of the Territory of the Saar Basin established under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles). After the Second World War, Birkenfeld belonged to the French Occupation Zone, and since 1946, it has been a district seat in Rhineland-Palatinate.

==Religion==
In 2008, 50% of the town&#x27;s inhabitants were Evangelical and 31% were Catholic. Besides these two biggest groups, there are an Evangelical Free Church congregation (Baptists), the Mennonite Brethren Church, a New Apostolic church and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

==Politics==
Birkenfeld has been a district seat since 1947 and forms together with 30 other municipalities a &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot;, a kind of collective municipality, called the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Birkenfeld.

===Town council===
The council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipal election held on 25 May 2014 yielded the following results:
BFL is &quot;Birkenfelder Freie Liste&quot; (“Birkenfeld Free List”).
BfB is &quot;Bürger für Birkenfeld&quot; (“Citizens for Birkenfeld”).

===Mayors===
Birkenfeld&#x27;s mayor is Miroslaw Kowalski (CDU), re-elected in 2019. His predecessor was Peter Nauert (CDU). Peter Nauert was the first mayor ever to be elected by direct vote by the people of Birkenfeld. Both his predecessors, Manfred Dreier and Erich Mörsdorf, headed both the town and the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Birkenfeld at once.

Werner Käufer was the last professional mayor of the town of Birkenfeld. Indeed, he was acclaimed in the office in 1968 with a great majority for another 12 years, but by 1970, he had to give up his professional office when, under administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants were merged into &quot;Verbandsgemeinden&quot;.

The following have served as mayor of Birkenfeld:
* Eugen Ruppenthal from 1923 to 1933 and from 1949 to 1953
* Oswald Morenz from 1953 to 1961
* Werner Käufer from 1961 to 1970
* Erich Mörsdorf from 1971 to 1990
* Manfred Dreier from 1990 to 2000, (SPD)
* Peter Nauert from 2000 until 2014 (CDU)
* Miroslaw Kowalski since 2014, (CDU)

===Coat of arms===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Azure on a mount vert a birch tree with roots proper surmounted by an inescutcheon chequy gules and argent.

The main charge, the birch tree, is canting for the town&#x27;s name (“birch” is &quot;Birke&quot; in German). The inescutcheon with the red and silver “chequy” pattern is the coat of arms formerly borne by the “Hinder” County of Sponheim, thus bearing witness to that time in the town&#x27;s history. This composition is based on an old court seal from 1577.

The arms have been borne since 29 October 1923, when they were approved by the Ministry of the Interior at Oldenburg.

===Town partnerships===
Birkenfeld fosters partnerships with the following places:
* Roerdalen, Limburg, Netherlands
* Château-Salins, Moselle, France

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Lambdacism in the local dialect===
In bygone days, the local Birkenfeld dialect was marked by the peculiarity of often replacing the sounds /d/ and /t/ – and sometimes /r/ as well – with /l/, a shift known as . For example, a Birkenfelder in those days would have said &quot;Fulerlale&quot; where Standard High German would have &quot;Futterladen&quot; (“fodder shop”). A full-sentence example can be seen in a remark made by the Birkenfeld sexton “Fuchs Karl” to the church councillor and parish priest Haag: &quot;Jo, jo, Herr Kirjerot, pririje kann e jela, awa noch lang net loule!&quot;, or in Standard High German, &quot;Ja, ja, Herr Kirchenrat, predigen kann ein jeder, aber noch lange nicht läuten!&quot; (“Yes, yes, Mr. Church Councillor, preaching is something anyone can do, but bellringing, not for long”).

Lambdacism, though, long ago vanished from the Birkenfeld dialect, having given way to the other shift that is customary in Hunsrückisch: rhotacism.

===Museums===
The &quot;Landesmuseum des Vereins für Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld&quot; (“State Museum of the Association for Local History in the Rural District of Birkenfeld”) offers an overview of 2,500 years of cultural history. The centrepiece is the interactively equipped Celtic experience exhibit &quot;Kelten, Kunst und Kult erleben&quot; (“Experience Celts, Art and Worship”). Here, through reconstructions, archaeological finds and replicas, these people&#x27;s life is presented. Further exhibits deal with regional and territorial history of the &quot;Birkenfelder Land&quot;. Historical highlights among these exhibits are the High Middle Ages (13th to 15th centuries) and Oldenburg times in the Principality of Birkenfeld beginning in the early 19th century. Regularly changing exhibits deal with both historical and current themes.

In 2006, restoration work began in an effort to bring the house up to a standard worthy of monumental protection. Since 2008, the building has housed not only the Birkenfeld district folk high school but also seven gallery rooms for changing exhibitions of works by local and national artists.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Economy===
The town&#x27;s economy is characterized mainly by small and midsize businesses. Owing to Birkenfeld&#x27;s history as a noble residence town and an administrative seat, no great industrial development ever took place here. The biggest employers, besides the administrative bodies, are thus a foundation and the Bundeswehr.

The German Red Cross’s (DRK) &quot;Elisabeth-Stiftung&quot;, a medical rehabilitation foundation, with its hospital, &quot;Berufsförderungswerk Birkenfeld&quot; (an institute for retraining workers whose condition precludes their return to former occupations), private vocational schools, measures for youth and senior citizens’ home is with more than 600 employees the town&#x27;s biggest employer. Following the &quot;Elisabeth-Stiftung&quot; is the Bundeswehr (among other units, the 2nd Luftwaffe Division) with more than 500 military and civilian personnel. The &quot;Stefan-Morsch-Stiftung&quot;, a foundation for keeping data on potential bone marrow and stem cell donors, has its seat in Birkenfeld.

On the lands of the former railway station, a centre for starting up businesses (“BIG-Center”) was built in the 1990s.

===Transport===

====Road====
Birkenfeld has good road links to &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 41 (east-west, between Mainz and Saarbrücken) and 269 (between Bernkastel-Kues and Saarlouis), as well as to Autobahn A 62, which is the most important north–south link, running between Trier and Kaiserslautern. Furthermore, &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 269 links to the &quot;Hunsrückhöhenstraße&quot;, and thereby to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, which lies 50 km away by road. This journey is covered five times each day by a bus service.

====Rail====
Birkenfeld&#x27;s rail link is 5 km away in nearby Neubrücke, which has a station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen–Saarbrücken). Saarbrücken can be reached by train in 45 minutes, and Frankfurt in less than two hours. The former spur line leading to Birkenfeld has been abandoned, and is now a cycle path.

====Hiking trails====
Running outwards from Birkenfeld are five local loop trails for hiking with a total length through the region of more than 60 km. These are the &quot;Glockenweg&quot; (roughly 16 km), the &quot;Eulenweg&quot; (roughly 9 km), the &quot;Mausweg&quot; (roughly 12.5 km), the &quot;Mühlenweg&quot; (roughly 12.5 km) and the &quot;Rehweg&quot; (roughly 12.5 km). The long-distance Nahe-Höhenweg and the Sironaweg, which leads by many Celtic-Roman archaeological finds, likewise run by Birkenfeld.

====Cycle paths====
The roughly 120 km-long &quot;Nahe-Radweg&quot; and the &quot;Rheinland-Pfalz-Route&quot; run right through the middle of town. They are supplemented by three local cycling circuits, R1, R2 and R3, with a total length of just under 80 km.

===Public institutions===

====Education====
Since 1996, a vocational school has been established on the grounds of a former US military hospital in the neighbouring municipality of Hoppstädten-Weiersbach. The Environmental Campus Birkenfeld (&quot;Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld&quot;) has, as a branch of the Trier University of Applied Sciences, made a significant contribution to the Birkenfeld region&#x27;s economic development.

For school-age children there is a broad array of offerings. 
* Primary school
* Realschule plus
* Gymnasium Birkenfeld
* Förderschule Schwerpunkt Lernen (special school with focus on learning)

Enjoying more than local importance is the &quot;Elisabeth-Stiftung&quot; medical rehabilitation foundation, with its specific offers of qualifications to people with either physical or mental handicaps. Alumni come from all over Germany and even from neighbouring countries.

Among other academic offerings is the &quot;Volkshochschule Birkenfeld&quot;, a folk high school.

====Authorities====
Birkenfeld is the location of a number of authorities:
* District administration
* &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; administration
* &quot;Bundesagentur für Arbeit&quot; (Federal employment agency)
* Land surveying office
* Police department
* Forester&#x27;s office

===Sport and leisure===
Birkenfeld has, among other sport and leisure facilities, a heated outdoor swimming pool, the &quot;Stadion am Berg&quot; (“Stadium at the Mountain”), several sport halls, a zoo, two libraries, a vocational library and the youth centre. In 2000, a skatepark was built at the youth centre, which in 2005 was expanded with a funbox, a quarter pipe, a ramp and an obstacle.

<text>St. George Cricket Grounds or more properly just St. George Grounds is a former baseball venue located on Staten Island, New York. St. George was the home park for the New York Metropolitans of the American Association for the and seasons. The grounds were also a part-time home to the New York Giants of the National League in .
The grounds were also known as Mutrie&#x27;s Dump or Mutrie&#x27;s Dumping Grounds, referring to Jim Mutrie, manager of the Metropolitans and the Giants.

The stadium, which was built in the style of a typical horse race track grandstand, was first used as a baseball field in 1853, with the first game between the New York Knickerbockers and the Washington Club. The site later became part of the development of the then-new community of St. George, Staten Island in 1886, by Erastus Wiman. He established the Staten Island Amusement Company, which owned both the Metropolitans and the grounds. Fans were able to watch games while also watching the construction of the Statue of Liberty a few miles to the north. 

Although the community and the ferry were successful, baseball was not. The Giants were a strong team through the latter part of the 1880s, while the Metropolitans floundered. Over time, there was less and less fan incentive to make the trip across the water from other parts of the city. The Mets folded after the 1887 season. 

The Amusement Company presented various elaborate stage plays on the site, with detrimental physical impact on the grounds, leaving the field in nearly unplayable condition. In 1889, the Giants had to find a temporary home after the city closed the original Polo Grounds. The Giants played some games at St. George from April 29 – June 14, 1889, while awaiting construction of the new Polo Grounds; their move back to Manhattan ended professional baseball at St. George for over a century.

As noted in the SABR research, the Staten Island Amusement Company grounds were on a block bounded by Wall Street (north-northwest, grandstand and hence home plate); railroad tracks and New York Bay (east-northeast, left field); Hyatt Street (south-southeast, center field); and Jay Street (Richmond Terrace) (west-southwest, right field). This block is now occupied by a shopping center called Empire Outlets. The modern ballpark SIUH Community Park is across Wall Street from it to the north.

<text>William Ormsby-Gore (14 March 1779 – 4 May 1860), known as William Gore until 1815, was a British Member of Parliament.

==Life==
Born into an Anglo-Irish family as William Gore, the eldest son of William Gore, M.P., of Woodford, County Leitrim, he was the great-great-grandson of William Gore, third and youngest son of Sir Arthur Gore, 1st Baronet, of Newtown, second son of Sir Paul Gore, 1st Baronet, of Magharabag, whose eldest son Paul was the grandfather of Arthur Gore, 1st Earl of Arran. He was educated at Eton College (1796), the Middle Temple (1796) and Merton College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1797. In 1815, he married Mary Jane Ormsby, daughter and heiress of Owen Ormsby. He assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Ormsby the same year.

He joined the British Army and served as a lieutenant in the 1st Dragoon Guards in 1800, was promoted to captain in 1802, to major in 1802 and to brevet major in 1813. He went onto half-pay with the 86th Foot in 1815 and as a captain in the 88th Foot. He left the Army in 1829. He was appointed High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1817–18 and High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1820–21.

Ormsby-Gore was elected to the House of Commons for County Leitrim in 1806, a seat he held until 1807, and then represented Caernarvon from 1830 to 1831 and North Shropshire from 1835 to 1857.

He died at Porkington and was buried at Selattyn. He had 3 sons (one of whom predeceased him) and 2 daughters. His eldest son John Ormsby Gore was M.P. for Caernarvonshire and created Baron Harlech in 1876. His second son William became 2nd Baron Harlech after the death of his brother.

<doc id="1296982" wikidata="Q1144147" url="?curid=1296982" title="Tweetie Pie">
<text>Tweetie Pie is a 1947 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on May 3, 1947, and stars Tweety with Sylvester, who is called &quot;Thomas&quot; in this cartoon.

&quot;Tweetie Pie&quot; marks the first pairing of the characters Sylvester and Tweety, and it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1947, breaking &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;″s streak of four consecutive wins in the category and winning Warner Bros. their first Academy Award.

==Plot==
Thomas the Cat persistently endeavors to capture Tweety, a canary he discovers outside seeking warmth from a smoldering cigar stub amidst wintry conditions. Thomas&#x27;s unseen owner intervenes just in time to prevent Tweety from becoming his prey, reprimanding Thomas for his predatory instinct. Despite explicit instructions to leave Tweety undisturbed, Thomas repeatedly attempts to seize him from his cage, each endeavor culminating in calamitous failures that attract his owner&#x27;s admonishment and physical chastisement.

Employing cunning stratagems, Tweety manipulates Thomas, feigning distress to provoke a response and later resorting to self-defense by pricking Thomas&#x27;s palm with a pin, inducing him to relinquish his hold. Subsequent efforts by Thomas to reenter the domicile through the chimney and a basement window are thwarted by Tweety&#x27;s resourcefulness, resulting in comedic misadventures and Thomas&#x27;s successive humiliations.

Undeterred by setbacks, Thomas devises an elaborate contraption to ensnare Tweety, yet his scheme precipitates his own injury instead. In a final, ill-fated endeavor to capture Tweety, Thomas inadvertently triggers a catastrophic collapse of the attic ceiling, prompting a frenzied response in which he destroys his owner&#x27;s broom in a futile attempt to evade retribution. Ultimately, Thomas finds himself on the receiving end of punishment, administered not by his owner, but by the diminutive Tweety, who disparagingly dubs him a &quot;bad ol&#x27; putty tat.&quot;

==Production==
In 1945, Bob Clampett, the original creator of Tweety, conceived the idea for a fourth cartoon in which he is paired with Friz Freleng&#x27;s Sylvester the Cat. This proposed cartoon, tentatively titled &quot;Fat Rat and the Stupid Cat&quot;, aimed to be the first collaboration between Sylvester and Tweety. However, Clampett&#x27;s departure from Warner Bros. in May led to the cancellation of the project during pre-production. His final Tweety cartoon, &quot;A Gruesome Twosome&quot;, was released a month later. Meanwhile, Freleng took a liking to Clampett&#x27;s bird character, but would redesign Tweety with a coat of yellow feathers, and smaller feet. The production of &quot;Tweetie&quot; &quot;Pie&quot; would begin in June 1945.

According to the documentary &quot;Friz on Film,&quot; producer Edward Selzer initially rejected Freleng of using Tweety for his new short, as he felt that pairing him with Sylvester was impractical. Instead he insisted that Freleng use the woodpecker from &quot;Peck Up Your Troubles&quot;, thinking he was it was a better adversary. Freleng&#x27;s insistence on using Tweety led to a confrontation in which he threatened Selzer to make the cartoon himself before storming back home. Selzer eventually relented later that night, allowing the collaboration. The resulting film earned Warner Bros. Cartoons its first Oscar, an accolade initially accepted by Selzer and later inherited by Freleng after Selzer&#x27;s passing in 1970.

This successful pairing cemented Tweety and Sylvester as a popular duo, ensuring their continued partnership in subsequent appearances due to their substantial star power. However, Sylvester also featured in numerous shorts without Tweety, notably in the Hippety Hopper series alongside Sylvester Jr., directed by Robert McKimson. Additionally, Sylvester appeared alongside Speedy Gonzales in cartoons supervised by both Freleng and McKimson, earning another Oscar in 1955 for their collaboration.

==Home media==
Although the cartoon was re-released into the Blue Ribbon program in 1955, the cartoon&#x27;s original titles are known to exist. When re-released, like most &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; at the time, the original ending bullet titles were kept. On the following sets, the Blue Ribbon re-release print is available. The original titles were found in 2011 and it is unknown if Warner Bros. is aware of their existence, since the Platinum Collection set released in 2012 still had the Blue Ribbon titles.

<text>Speranza Park is a former baseball ground located in Toledo, Ohio, United States. The ground was home to the Toledo Maumees of the American Association during the 1890 season.

The ballpark was located on a block bounded by Cherry Street, Frederick Street, and Franklin Avenue.

The word &quot;speranza&quot; means &quot;hope&quot; in Italian. The park was reportedly named for the club owner&#x27;s yacht. The team&#x27;s first home game was played on May 1, 1890. The team finished a few games above .500, and 20 games back of first place, ending whatever major league hopes the club aspired to. The final home game was held on October 2, 1890.

<text>Coesfeld (; Westphalian: &quot;Koosfeld&quot;) is the capital of the district of Coesfeld in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

==History==

Coesfeld received its city rights in 1197, but was first recorded earlier than that in the biography of St. Ludger, patron and first bishop of the diocese of Munster who was born north of Coesfeld in Billerbeck. The day before he died, Ludger spent the night in Coesfeld and heard mass in the morning in the church he founded. He was on his way from his abbey in Essen to Münster. The road he followed passed Coesfeld and Billerbeck, and after preaching in the St. Lambert&#x27;s church, 26 March 809, he travelled on to Billerbeck, where he died in the evening.

The Coesfeld St. Jacobikirche dates from the same period as the city charter. For centuries, Coesfeld was an important stopping place for pilgrims traveling one of the more popular Germanic Jakobi routes (Way of St. James) leading from Warendorf over Münster (via Billerbeck) to Coesfeld, and then on via Borken to Wesel on the Rhine.

===Bernhard von Galen===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, troops were stationed in Coesfeld. The Prince-bishop of Münster was often at odds with these troops. Bernhard von Galen managed to drive the foreign troops away and even started to build a palace in Coesfeld, but it was never finished and after he died it was torn down. He became known for his sieges of Dutch cities in his efforts for the Counter-Reformation and started a Way of the Cross procession that still exists up to the present day, with 18 Stations of the Cross. One procession round the historic centre of Coesfeld is still held on Whitmonday but the &quot;Great Procession along the stations of the cross&quot; held for centuries on Whit Tuesday is now held on 9/14 (Exaltation of the Cross) if it is a Sunday otherwise on the Sunday thereafter.

==Geography==

<text>Düren (; Ripuarian: Düre) is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, between Aachen and Cologne, on the river Rur.

==History==

===Roman era===
The area of Düren was part of Gallia Belgica, more specifically the territory of the Eburones, a people who were described as both Belgae and Germani.
It was conquered by the Roman Republic under Julius Caesar and became part of Germania inferior.

Düren became a supply area for the rapidly growing Roman city of Cologne (Roman name Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium). Furthermore, a few important Roman roads skirt Düren (including the road from Cologne to Jülich and Tongeren and the road from Cologne to Zülpich and Trier). By the 4th century, the area was settled by the Ripuarian Franks.
The name &quot;villa duria&quot; occurred the first time in the Frankish Annals in the year 747.

Frankish king Pippin the Short often visited Düren in the 8th century and held a few important conventions there. The Franks made of Düren a royal palace, from which the name Palatine (Pfalz in German) is derived. Charlemagne sojourned a few times there. Due to the frequent visits of Charlemagne, a few markets sprang up, such as the corn, cattle, wood, chicken, and butter markets, all of which contributed to Düren&#x27;s development. The castle was built at the place where, since 1991, the Saint Anne Church is located.

===Middle Ages===
Düren obtained city rights in the early 13th century. Around 1200, the construction of the city wall was started, which includes 12 towers and 5 gates. The gates faced all directions: in the north, the &quot;Philippstor&quot; and the &quot;Wirteltor&quot;, in the east the &quot;Kölntor&quot; (Cologne gate), in the south the &quot;Obertor&quot; and in the west the &quot;Holztor&quot; (wooden gate). There are still ruins of the gates today.

The chiseler Leonhard stole a small box with the relic of Saint Anne out of the Mainzer Stiftskirche St. Stephan in 1501 and brought it to Düren. Pope Julius II decided on March 18, 1506, that Düren could keep the remains. They were kept in the &quot;Martinskirche&quot; (church of Saint Martin) which was renamed the &quot;Annakirche&quot; (church of Saint Anne) in 1505. (Probably the church was renamed much later, because in the 19th century it was still called sometimes parish church of the holy Martinus). Saint Anne became the patron saint of Düren. Every year, the saint&#x27;s day of Saint Anne (July 26) is celebrated for one week with the Anna octavos and the Anna parish fair, one of the biggest folk festivals of Germany.

===17th to 19th century===

In 1642, Düren was embroiled in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Opposing troops destroyed the city. After the war has finally ended in 1648, plague broke out and caused many lives to be lost. A second plague epidemic broke out in 1665. Due to the various attacks on the debilitated city, Düren was destroyed again in 1679. In this time, the settlement Miesheim was destroyed, never to be rebuilt.

Towards the end of the year 1755 in the area around Düren and Aachen began a series of earthquakes, which reached its peak on February 18, 1756 with an earthquake with the strength 8 on the Mercalli scale. The series of earthquakes affected all of Europe, most famously the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

The businesses in the area of Düren was affected since the 15th century by the drapery and metal industry. Since the beginning of the 17th century, paper industry had settled here, advantaged by the exceptionally soft water of the Rur. Rütger von Scheven built the first paper mill in Düren. In 1812, there were already 17 paper factories, 11 cloth- and blanket factories, an iron rolling mill or slitting mill and two iron foundries.

In the year 1794, Düren was occupied by French revolutionary troops. From 1798 until 1814, Düren was the main city of the same named canton in the arrondissement Aachen of the French &quot;Roerdepartements&quot; (from the name of the River Rur (Roer) and &quot;département&quot;). After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Düren was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia and was subsequently administered within the Rhine Province.

===20th century===
By 1900, Düren was among Germany&#x27;s richest cities (with 42 millionaires and 93 factories) and had a population of 27,168. By comparison, fewer than 5,000 people had lived in Düren a century earlier.

The city of Düren was located on the main fighting front during the Allied invasion of Germany in World War II. During 1944 and 1945, the protracted and bloody Battle for Hürtgenwald was fought on Düren&#x27;s district area, and on November 16, 1944, Düren was completely destroyed by Allied air bombings. Approximately 22,000 people lived in Düren at that time, and 3,000 of them died during the bombing. Those who survived were evacuated to central Germany. Destroyed buildings included the Stadttheater Düren (1907), designed in Jugendstil by Carl Moritz.

By 1939, the population had risen to over 45,000, but then fell to just 3,806 by June 1945 due to the effects of World War II. After the bombing of November 16, 1944, on March 1, 1945, only four German residents lived in the city, including forced laborers etc. there were 21 people. On April 1, the number of inhabitants had risen to 180 and on May 1, 1945, there were already 1218 people. In December 1945 the number increased to 25,000 inhabitants and in 1958 it was 45,000, the same number as before the war. Due to the incorporation of several places in the area, the city&#x27;s population grew on January 1, 1972, by 35,522 to 89,087.

On February 25, 1945, U.S. troops crossed the Rur at Düren. After the war was over in the summer that year, many evacuated people came back to the destroyed city and started to rebuild their homes against the advice of the American troops. By June 1945, the population had risen to 3,806. Most of the architecture in Düren therefore dates from the 1950s.
==Culture and points of interest==
The most famous museum of Düren is the Leopold Hoesch Museum. The Baroque Revival style building erected in 1905 presents changing exhibitions of contemporary art. Since 1986, it also displays artworks from the international Biennale PaperArt. Since 2006, the former nurses&#x27; home of the St. Augustinus Hospital Lendersdorf has housed the Düren Carnival Museum. The most recent museum is the Stadtmuseum Düren local history museum, founded in 2009.

==Theatre and music==
The former Stadttheater Düren was opened in January 1907. In the bombing of November 16, 1944, the theatre was almost completely destroyed. Today cultural performances take place mainly at the &quot;Haus der Stadt&quot;. Since 2004 the multi-functional &quot;Arena Kreis Düren&quot;, which has around 2000 seats, serves as a venue for major concerts.

The jazz festival Dürener Jazztage is hosted in Düren annually.

==Buildings==
At the edge of the forest in the Niederau district lies Burgau Castle. The water castle ways inhabited by the Counts of Heinsberg at the beginning of the 14th Century. After it was destroyed in 1944, the restoration process lasted from 1979 to 1998.
In Theodor Heuss Park is the Bismarck Memorial, erected in 1892 to commemorate the most famous honorary citizen from Düren.
The town hall was inaugurated in 1959. It now ranks as an example of 1950s architecture under Cultural heritage management.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Düren is Frank Peter Ullrich of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

<doc id="1297053" wikidata="Q3056269" url="?curid=1297053" title="Eric Foner">
<text>Eric Foner (; born February 7, 1943) is an American historian. He writes extensively on American political history, the history of freedom, the early history of the Republican Party, African American biography, the American Civil War, Reconstruction, and historiography, and has been a member of the faculty at the Columbia University Department of History since 1982. He is the author of several popular textbooks, such as the &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; series for high school classrooms. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Foner is the most frequently cited author on college syllabi for history courses. According to historian Timothy Snyder, Foner is the first to associate the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021 with section three of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Foner has published several books on the Reconstruction period, starting with &quot;&quot; in 1988. His online courses on &quot;The Civil War and Reconstruction&quot;, published in 2014, are available from Columbia University on ColumbiaX.

In 2011, Foner&#x27;s &quot;The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery&quot; (2010) won the Pulitzer Prize for History, the Lincoln Prize, and the Bancroft Prize. Foner previously won the Bancroft Prize in 1989 for his book &quot;Reconstruction: America&#x27;s Unfinished Revolution - 1863–1877&quot;. In 2000, he was elected president of the American Historical Association. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Foner was born February 7, 1943, in New York City, New York, the son of Jewish parents, Liza (née Kraitz), a high school art teacher, and historian Jack D. Foner, who was active in the trade union movement and the campaign for civil rights for African Americans. Eric Foner describes his father as his &quot;first great teacher&quot;, and recalls how,

After graduating from Long Beach High School in 1959, Foner enrolled at Columbia University, where he was originally a physics major, before switching to history after taking a year-long seminar with James P. Shenton on the Civil War and Reconstruction during his junior year. &quot;It probably determined that most of my career has been focused on that period,&quot; he recalled years later. A year later, in 1963, Foner graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts in history. He studied at the University of Oxford as a Kellett Fellow; he received a BA from Oriel College in 1965, where he was a member of the college&#x27;s 1966 University Challenge winning team, though he did not appear in the final, having already returned to the US. After graduating from Oxford, Foner returned to Columbia where he earned his doctoral degree in 1969 under the supervision of Richard Hofstadter. His doctoral thesis, published in 1970 as &quot;Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War&quot;, explored the deeply rooted ideals and interests that drove the northern majority to oppose slavery and ultimately wage war against Southern secession.

==Career==

===Writing on the Reconstruction Era===
Foner is a leading authority on the Reconstruction Era. In a seminal essay in &quot;American Heritage&quot; in October 1982, later reprinted in &quot;Reviews in American History&quot;, Foner wrote,

&quot;Foner has established himself as the leading authority on the Reconstruction period,&quot; wrote historian Michael Perman in reviewing &quot;Reconstruction&quot;. &quot;This book is not simply a distillation of the secondary literature; it is a masterly account – broad in scope as well as rich in detail and insight. &quot;This is history written on a grand scale, a masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history,&quot; David Herbert Donald wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. C. Vann Woodward, in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, wrote, &quot;Eric Foner has put together this terrible story with greater cogency and power, I believe, than has been brought to the subject heretofore.&quot;

In a 2009 essay, Foner pondered whether Reconstruction might have turned out differently.

Foner&#x27;s recent short summary of his views was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2015.

===Secession and the Soviet Union===
As a visiting professor in Moscow in the early 1990s, Foner compared secessionist forces in the USSR with the secession movement in the US in the 1860s. In a February 1991 article, Foner noted that the Baltic states claimed the right to secede because they had been unwillingly annexed. In addition, he believed that the Soviet Union did not protect minorities while it tried to nationalize the republics. Foner identified a threat to existing minority groups within the Baltic states, who were in turn threatened by the new nationalist movements.

===Popular publications and documentaries===
In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, he criticized President Donald Trump&#x27;s tweet calling for the preservation of Confederate monuments and heritage, stating that they represented and glorified white supremacy rather than collective heritage.

====Media appearances====
Foner has made multiple appearance on shows such as &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show&quot; to discuss US history.

==Reception==
Journalist Nat Hentoff described Foner&#x27;s &quot;The Story of American Freedom&quot; as &quot;an indispensable book that should be read in every school in the land.&quot; &quot;Eric Foner is one of the most prolific, creative, and influential American historians of the past 20 years,&quot; according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. His work is &quot;brilliant, important,&quot; a reviewer wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In a review of &quot;The Story of American Freedom&quot; in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, Theodore Draper disagreed with Foner&#x27;s conclusions, saying &quot;If the story of American freedom is told largely from the perspective of blacks and women, especially the former, it is not going to be a pretty tale. Yet most Americans thought of themselves not only as free but as the freest people in the world.&quot;

John Patrick Diggins of the City University of New York wrote that Foner&#x27;s &quot;Reconstruction: America&#x27;s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877&quot;, was a &quot;magisterial&quot; and &quot;moving&quot; narrative, but compared Foner&#x27;s &quot;unforgiving&quot; view of America for its racist past to his notably different views on the fall of communism and Soviet history.

Foner&#x27;s book &quot;Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad&quot; (2015) was judged &quot;Intellectually probing and emotionally resonant&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times.&quot; His previous book &quot;The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery&quot; (2010) was described by &quot;Library Journal&quot; as &quot;In the vast library on Lincoln, Foner&#x27;s book stands out as the most sensible and sensitive reading of Lincoln&#x27;s lifetime involvement with slavery and the most insightful assessment of Lincoln&#x27;s—and indeed America&#x27;s—imperative to move toward freedom lest it be lost.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In 1989, Foner received the Avery O. Craven Award from the Organization of American Historians. In 1991, Foner received the Great Teacher Award from the &quot;Society of Columbia Graduates&quot;. In 1995, he was named Scholar of the Year by the New York Council for the Humanities.

In 2009, Foner was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois as a Bicentennial Laureate.

In 2012, Foner received The Lincoln Forum&#x27;s Richard Nelson Current Award of Achievement.

In 2020, Foner was awarded the Roy Rosenzweig Distinguished Service Award from the Organization of American Historians which goes to an individual or individuals whose contributions have significantly enriched our understanding and appreciation of American history.

==Personal life==
Foner was married to screenwriter Naomi Foner (née Achs) from 1965 to 1977. Since 1982, Foner has been married to historian Lynn Garafola. They have a daughter, Daria.

<doc id="1297072" wikidata="Q3736189" url="?curid=1297072" title="Extreme Dodgeball">
<text>Extreme Dodgeball is an American game show based on the game of dodgeball that aired between 2004 and 2005 on the Game Show Network. The series ran for three seasons, each of which featured six to eight teams of five to seven players. The first series followed gimmick teams, such as sumo wrestlers and jockeys, which changed over time into the third series with franchise-like teams representing cities. All three seasons are presented by Bil Dwyer and Zach Selwyn.

The series was created by Rich Cronin and produced by Mindless Entertainment and made to accompany the Rawson Marshall Thurber movie &quot;&quot;.

==Standard rules==

The game is a variation of dodgeball, in which players from each team attempt to hit players from the other team with a ball in order to eliminate them from the round without leaving their half of the court.

In the first two seasons, two teams of five compete in a match of three rounds in a best-of-three format. This was altered significantly for season three, see &quot;Other Rule Changes and Amendments&quot; below. A round ends when one of the two teams loses all five of its members. The first round is standard and is played with two dodgeballs. In the second round, often called the &quot;Big Ball Round,&quot; a third ball which is twice the diameter of the other two is added into play. This ball is often used to deflect attacks. In the third round, &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; the Big Ball is removed and in its place is an orange headband that is placed on one member of each team who is designated the &quot;Dead Man Walking.&quot; In the first and second seasons, if the Dead Man Walking is eliminated, the team he represents loses the game and consequently the match.

===Elimination===
In each of the three seasons, there were multiple ways for an athlete to be eliminated and sent to the sideline. Some variations in these regulations exist in the three seasons, but for the most part these rules remain the same. The following are ways in which a member of a team can be eliminated:
* Getting hit with a ball
* Throwing a ball which an opponent catches (in this case, a person previously eliminated can come back in, but the number of people in the playing arena cannot exceed 5)
* Dropping a ball being used to deflect a ball thrown by an opposing player
* Crossing over the center line or (in seasons one and two) stepping outside the boundary
There are also two ways of returning to the game after being eliminated. The first, as previously mentioned, is if a player catches a ball. At this point, one of their teammates can come back onto the court, until five members are on the court. The second way is called a regeneration. In the first season, if all but one member of the team were eliminated, the last player had the opportunity to hit a target aptly named the &quot;regeneration target&quot; and, if this was accomplished before he was eliminated, all of his teammates returned to the court. In season two, the last player on the court only had to stay alive for 20 seconds, which would regenerate the entire team. In both cases, a team could only regenerate once per round. Lastly, in the third season, this rule was changed again. If the last player standing is able to not be eliminated for 30 seconds, only one of his teammates can return, but if the last player is eliminated, four team members return to the game. However, this could be done an unlimited number of times.

===Other rule changes and amendments===
For the second season, there were two more main changes. Firstly, there was a 5-second delay of game warning. If a team held more than one ball for over 5 seconds, one of its players would be out.

The second rule stated that if a player, in the opinion of the referee, was impeding the flow of play of the game by stalling, refusing to throw the ball, or attempting to force a play on the opposing team, the referee(s) could give that player a &quot;yellow card&quot;. Two yellow cards meant that the player in question was ejected. This second rule was introduced in the early stages of the second season and is called the &quot;Benedetto Amendment&quot; after player David Benedetto, when he deliberately placed two balls immediately on his opponents&#x27; side of the court, forcing the opponents - in compliance with the above-stated five-second-rule - to approach the balls, allowing Benedetto to hit them at point blank range, a tactic which was deemed unfair by the show&#x27;s producers. Although Michael &#x27;Handsome&#x27; Constanza originally used the tactics in Episode 1 of Season 1, there was no five-second rule back then, so it was not as abusive.

In the third season, many significant changes were made to the rules. First, the teams would add two players each, increasing the number of players from five to seven. Still however, only five members of the team would be allowed on the court at any given time. The players who came on the court rotated, if four of a team&#x27;s five players were eliminated, and the final player regenerated a teammate, the sixth member came onto the court.

The main change in this season was the format of the matches. Instead of 3 rounds which ended when all of the players on one of the teams were eliminated, the matches would be divided to four six-minute quarters. The victor would not be decided by the fastest elimination of an entire team, rather, the team with the most points at the end of the 24 minutes. If a player eliminates any opponent in any way, his team gains one point. A bonus point is awarded for wiping out the entire other team.

Other small changes were added. For example, if a player received a yellow card for yelling at the referee, holding a ball for too long, disobeying the instructions given, etc., he would have to stand in a small square while a player on the other team would be given a free shot at him. If the penalized player is hit, the opposing team scores a point, if the player leaves the square&#x27;s boundaries, two points are awarded. Another small change was in the court itself. In previous seasons, the boundaries had been on the left, right, and front for each team. In this season, however, the left and right boundaries were removed and the court became similar to that of many indoor sports, such as indoor soccer or ice hockey.

In the second quarter, the Big Ball is put in play similar to the first two seasons. Since the big ball is used mainly for defending and is difficult to throw, two bonus points would be awarded for a kill through throwing.

In the third and fourth quarters, the teams are on the side opposite of that which they started. In the fourth quarter, the orange Dead Man Walking headband comes into play. One person on each team must wear the headband at all times. Any time a Dead Man Walking is eliminated, the other team gains two bonus points, but does not win the game. The headband is simply transferred to someone else. When two minutes remain in this quarter, there is a break in the game where the teams are allowed to switch the players on the court with ones on the bench (but each team retains the same &quot;number&quot; of players that had been on the floor). At the end of the fourth quarter, the team with the most points is declared the victor and is awarded $5,000.

If after the fourth quarter, a tie is reached, the game goes into overtime, in which each team chooses three players to represent them on the court. There are no regenerations, and catching a ball does not bring in a new player—once a player is out, they are out for good. The team which can last the longest is declared the winner of the match.

In the third season, referees are able to give players red cards, much like in soccer. If a player is given a red card, he is out for the rest of the game. Players get red cards if they behave in a particularly improper manner too serious for a yellow card, such as physical contact with an opponent in a harsh manner. Red cards are uncommon, but have been given multiple times. One player, Brian DeCato, was even suspended for the season due to repeated offenses.

===Tournament format and prize structure===

In season 1, each team played 5 matches; afterwards all 8 competed in the playoffs with 1st facing 8th, 2nd facing 7th, etc. The winners of these playoffs won $10,000.

In season 2, each team played 10 matches, and the top 3 teams from each division reached the playoffs. In the first round, the #2 and #3 seed in each division faced off against each other. The winner of these matches faced the #1 seed of their respective division (who earned a bye in round 1) in a playoff match for $5,000. Then the 2 division winners would face off in the championship match for an additional $20,000 ($25,000 total).

In season 3, the winners of each match received $5,000. As in the previous season, each team played 10 matches. The four teams with the best records competed in the semifinals, where the winners received another $5,000. The grand champions added an additional $10,000 to their total. Potentially a team could win up to $65,000.

==Hosts==
For all three seasons, the hosts have been Bil Dwyer and Zach Selwyn.

==Sideline reporters==
* Season 1: Jerri Manthey of Survivor
* Season 2: Mary Strong of NFL Network
* Season 3: Michele Merkin of E! Entertainment Network

==Commissioner==
Rip Torn, who played Patches O&#x27;Houlihan in &quot;&quot;, joined in Season 3 as the commissioner of the league.

==Teams==
Each team in Extreme Dodgeball had a gimmick. This could reflect the fact that gimmick teams were featured heavily in &quot;Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story&quot;. Usually, the members of a team shared a common profession, indicated in their name.

In the first season, the teams wore clothing linked to their gimmick, for example the CPA wore sweater-vests and neckties, the Stallion Battalion wore racing silks. In the second and third seasons, all teams wore uniforms similar to those worn in basketball, in team colors.

<text>The Cave Diving Group (CDG) is a United Kingdom-based diver training organisation specialising in cave diving.

The CDG was founded in 1946 by Graham Balcombe, making it the world&#x27;s oldest continuing diving club. Graham Balcombe and Jack Sheppard pioneered cave diving in the late 1930s, notably at Wookey Hole in Somerset.

Passages through caves are often blocked by a submerged section, or sump. Cavers in many countries have tried to pass these barriers in a variety of ways; using the simple &quot;free dive&quot; with a lungful of air or by utilising the available diving technology of the day.

==Early history of cave diving in the UK==
Two Post Office engineers, (Francis) Graham Balcombe and &quot;Jack&quot; Sheppard, who were among the leading climbers and cavers of their era, combined their energies into solving the problem of passing the Swildon&#x27;s sump. Their pioneering dive on 17 February 1934 used a home-made respirator, designed by Balcombe, that incorporated part of a ladies&#x27; bicycle frame. The attempt was unsuccessful but the foundation of cave diving in the U.K. had been laid.

In 1935, Balcombe made enquiries with Siebe Gorman, the leading diving engineers of the time. Although they could not help with light weight diving equipment, they did offer training and the loan of standard helmet diving gear. A successful expedition was mounted at Wookey Hole, where the waters from Swildon&#x27;s Hole resurge. Exploration of the subterranean River Axe proceeded to the seventh chamber, a distance of , which was as far as Balcombe and Diver No. 2, Penelope Powell could physically handle their pipes and ropes.

The team returned to Swildon&#x27;s Hole on 4 October 1936 with Jack Sheppard&#x27;s newly designed apparatus nicknamed &quot;Jimmy&quot;. It was fed by a football inflation pump that was coupled to a home-made drysuit that incorporated lighting and a telephone. This was used by Sheppard to pass Sump l.

Later that year the bicycle respirator became self-contained with the addition of an oxygen cylinder. In turn Balcombe dived solo through Sump 1 and found the air chambers of Sump 2. These pioneers established the pattern of UK cave diving; the systematic exploration of a cave system in its phreatic zone by diving both the resurgence and its tributaries. During the war years Balcombe developed a self-contained closed-circuit oxygen set using mainly medical components. In the Yorkshire Dales he began the great canon of exploration, now known as the Three Counties System with dives at Keld Head, Goyden Pot and Alum Pot.

==Formation of the Cave Diving Group==
After World War II surplus oxygen rebreather equipment became available, and the number of divers increased. In 1946 these enthusiasts had a meet in South Wales during which they formed the Cave Diving Group. Wookey Hole once more became the focus of diving activities. In addition to exploration, the early divers found a lot of archaeological material.

As the divers penetrated deeper into the cave, the need for penetration below (the safe limit of oxygen diving) became more urgent, and the first attempt with an early aqualung nearly ended in tragedy. Following this incident, the group concentrated on the use of semi-closed circuit rebreathers with oxygen/nitrogen mixtures (nitrox) suitable for the depth. In 1960 the way forward at Wookey Hole was found at a depth of , using 60/40 O2/N2. Rebreathers were also used successfully in South Wales, Derbyshire and Yorkshire.

==Accomplishments==
During the 60s, with the abandonment of National Service, there was an increase in caving activity by the post-war population bulge. Readily available commercial scuba equipment was adapted to cave diving. The process was accelerated by the Cave Diving Group&#x27;s publication of &quot;Cave Diving on Air&quot; by Mike Boon and the formation of the Independent Cave Diving Group.

Divers began to dive deeper and further, and inevitably there were tragedies. Two innovations were introduced in the interest of safety. Separate cylinders, each one with an independent demand valve; and the adoption of the &quot;Rule of Thirds&quot;: one third in, one third out, with one third kept as a safety reserve.

In the early days of cave diving in the UK there was always the hope of finding a way into the cave for the benefit of dry cavers. Amongst these must be mentioned Swildon&#x27;s Hole, Stoke Lane Slocker, Ogof Ffynnon Ddu II and Little Neath River Cave.

Progress and development of equipment and techniques have always come in phases, and with this progress, although still hoping to discover dry caves, came diving of a purely exploratory nature. This has led to advances at Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge caves in Somerset.

In Derbyshire a great deal of effort has produced significant discoveries in the Peak Cavern/Speedwell Cavern system. In South Wales many kilometres of Daren Cilau were first trodden by cave divers; and the link with Elm Hole and Pwll y Cwm was another major feat.

In the north of England, divers have made discoveries such as Boreham Cave, Notts Pot II and the connection between Gaping Gill and Ingleborough Cave and that between Gavel Pot and Pippikin Pot. Keld Head in Kingsdale has been the scene of operations over many years and the dive through from Kingsdale Master Cave represented a world standard. Later the dive was started from King Pot in the same cave system, a different route with a distance of .

In Ireland CDG members dived the connection between Noon&#x27;s Hole and Arch Cave, and between Prod&#x27;s Pot and Cascades Rising and between Polloughabo and Polbehan.

Several expeditions have connected two or more caves together. This tendency to explore water filled caves has been extended abroad to such places as the Bahamas, where there are flooded ocean blue holes. These have been explored by British divers since the early 1980s; several have been connected. CDG members have been active in exploring many sites in Europe and further afield, often using or pioneering the cutting edge of technology.

==Organisation and purpose==
The Cave Diving Group operates under a federal structure comprising four regionally based sections located in the major caving districts of Britain: Somerset, Welsh, Derbyshire and Northern, each with its own Secretary, Treasurer and Training Officer. These are governed loosely by a Central Committee which comprises national officers which oversees the running of the Group and liaises with other bodies.

The Cave Diving Group has traditionally not actively recruited members – a position adopted early on in its history when the availability of training and equipment was scarce. Likewise, owing to early fatalities in the sport, cave divers in the United Kingdom (unlike other areas of the world) have usually been represented by cavers who wished to dive. It is a condition of qualification as a cave diver within the CDG that the candidate is an experienced caver as well as a skilled cave diver.

A candidate for membership applies to one of the regional sections, making themselves and their experience known to members. They must be over 18 years old and in good health, never having suffered from epilepsy. Training is provided on a regional basis with national training camps under a loose mentoring system. Final election to qualification is carried out by the candidate&#x27;s peers - other diving members of the section.

The Group also welcomes non-diving members who wish to be associated with its activities; they receive all publications, may attend all meetings but pay a reduced subscription. Of great importance is the Group&#x27;s role in publishing information about exploration by members (and others) and developments in cave diving techniques. The Group produces a quarterly newsletter and a training manual. Sump Indices are available for each cave diving region (Somerset, Wales, Derbyshire &amp; Northern) of Great Britain which summarise diving activities from Group members and non-members over many years. The newsletter is free to members and on sale to the public as are all the other publications.

Members of the CDG are sometimes called upon to assist in cave rescue, particularly of cavers trapped by flood waters, such as the Alpazat cave rescue in Mexico in 2004 and the Tham Luang cave rescue in Thailand in 2019.

==Awards==

Mike &#x27;Fish&#x27; Jeanmaire was Chairman of the CDG for thirty years. Following his death in November 2010 the &#x27;Fish Award&#x27; was created. This is awarded annually to a member who has made a significant contribution to the CDG. Whilst the nature of the contribution is not precisely defined, the guiding principle is that the individual should have served the CDG rather than any other organisation or themselves.

<text>New Zealand Māori rugby league team is a rugby league representative side made up of New Zealand Māori players. The side represents the New Zealand Māori Rugby league. Like its union counterpart, the rugby league team previously competed in international competitions.

With some controversy, the team participated in the 2000 World Cup as Aotearoa Māori. The Super League International Board had agreed to give a place in their World Cup to the New Zealand Māori team as they attempted to gain allies during the Super League war. Despite that World Cup not taking place, the Rugby League International Federation repeated the offer for the 2000 World Cup when it replaced the Super League International Board following the end of the dispute.

==History==

A New Zealand Māori team first toured overseas in 1908 when they visited Australia. This tour was a success, and was followed by another tour to Australia in 1909 and to Great Britain in 1910.

The first game of international rugby league on New Zealand soil was between the Māori and the touring Great Britain Lions of 1910.

A separate body, the Māori Rugby League Board of Control, was formed in 1934 to administer the game in Māori communities. This governing body was later renamed the Aotearoa Māori Rugby League and in 1992 it was registered as an incorporated society.

The Māori have had a wonderful record of beating international touring teams over the years. In 1983 they visited Britain and a side containing future Kiwi stars like Hugh McGahan, Dean Bell and Clayton Friend proved too strong for the amateur opposition they played. For many years, the Māori have competed in the Pacific Cup alongside other teams with a strong presence of New Zealand–based players—Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands, so they thought it was right they should have the opportunity to follow these teams to the World Cup. The invitation to the Māori to take part in the 2000 World Cup came about as a result of promises made to them by the defunct Super League International Board at the height of the Super League war that tore the game apart in the southern hemisphere.

The Māori team has participated in the Pacific Cup (since 1974), Super League&#x27;s 1997 Oceania Cup, Papua New Guinea 50th Anniversary (1998), 2000 World Cup, World Sevens Qualification (2003) and Pacific Rim (2004) competitions.

The Māori competed against Indigenous Dreamtime team on 26 October 2008 as the curtain raiser to the first match of the 2008 World Cup. The Māori team lost 34–26.

In 2010, the Māori team played England at Mt. Smart Stadium in Auckland before the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations in New Zealand. After trailing 18–0 at halftime, the Māori came back to draw the match at 18–all.

In October 2013, the side faced the touring Murri Rugby League Team in a two–game series. The Māori side, featuring NRL players Charlie Gubb, Sam Rapira and Bodene Thompson, won the first game 48–18 at Davies Park, Huntly. The second game was played at Puketawhero Park, Rotorua and was won by the Māori side, 32–16.

In October 2014, the team travelled to Australia to play against the Queensland Māori team at Owen Park, Southport and the Murri Rugby League Team at BMD Kougari Oval, Wynnum.

In 2018 they took part in the NRL Festival of Indigenous Rugby League held in Redfern Sydney against the First Nation Goannas, they were beaten 22–16 in a thrilling finish.

<text>The Golem (original German title: &quot;Der Golem&quot;) is a novel written by Gustav Meyrink between 1907 and 1914. First published in serial form from December 1913 to August 1914 in the periodical &quot;Die Weißen Blätter&quot;, &quot;The Golem&quot; was published in book form in 1915 by Kurt Wolff, Leipzig. &quot;The Golem&quot; was Meyrink&#x27;s first novel. It sold over 200,000 copies in 1915. It became his most popular and successful literary work, and is generally described as the most &quot;accessible&quot; of his full-length novels. It was first translated into English in 1928.

The novel has an anonymous narrator, who has a visionary dream. It explores the theme of the unreliable narrator. The narrator is somehow able to chronicle the life of the jeweler Athanasius Pernath by assuming Pernath&#x27;s identity. 

== Plot ==
The novel centers on the life of Athanasius Pernath, a jeweler and art restorer who lives in the ghetto of Prague. But his story is experienced by an anonymous narrator, who, during a visionary dream, assumes Pernath&#x27;s identity thirty years before. This dream was perhaps induced because he inadvertently swapped his hat with the real (old) Pernath&#x27;s. While the novel is generally focused on Pernath&#x27;s own musings and adventures, it also chronicles the lives, the characters, and the interactions of his friends and neighbors. The Golem, though rarely seen, is central to the novel as a representative of the ghetto&#x27;s own spirit and consciousness, brought to life by the suffering and misery that its inhabitants have endured over the centuries.

The story itself has a disjointed and often elliptical feel, as it was originally published in serial form and is intended to convey the mystical associations and interests that the author himself was exploring at the time. The reality of the narrator&#x27;s experiences is often called into question, as some of them may simply be dreams or [hallucinations]], and others may be metaphysical or transcendent events that are taking place outside the &quot;real&quot; world. Similarly, it is revealed over the course of the book that Pernath apparently suffered from a mental breakdown on at least one occasion, but has no memory of any such event; he is also unable to remember his childhood and most of his youth, a fact that may or may not be attributable to his previous breakdown. His mental stability is constantly called into question by his friends and neighbors, and the reader is left to wonder whether anything that has taken place in the narrative actually happened.

== Main characters ==
* Athanasius Pernath: the ostensible protagonist, a jeweler who resides in the ghetto of Prague
* The Golem: while connected with the Golem legend of Rabbi Judah Loew, the Golem is cast as a sort of entity, a physical manifestation of the ghetto&#x27;s inhabitants&#x27; collective psyche, as well as of the ghetto&#x27;s own &quot;self&quot;.
* Schemajah Hillel: a wise and gentle Jewish neighbor of Pernath, learned in the Torah and Talmud; serves as a protector and instructor for Pernath as the jeweler begins to walk the path of mysticism.
* Miriam: Hillel&#x27;s compassionate and noble daughter.
* Aaron Wassertrum: another of Pernath&#x27;s neighbors, this one a junk dealer and possibly a murderer. He is the antithesis of Hillel, embodying all of the then-popular negative stereotypes surrounding Jews.
* Rosina: a 14-year-old red-haired prostitute and neighbor of Pernath, apparently a relation of Wassertrum though no one is ever able to determine what kind; described by Pernath as repulsive, but figures prominently as the object of men&#x27;s desires and is promiscuous.
* Innocence Charousek: a consumptive, poverty-stricken student consumed with hatred for Wassertrum and his son, Dr. Wassory.
* Zwakh: a puppeteer; Pernath&#x27;s friend and landlord.
* Amadeus Laponder: Pernath&#x27;s cellmate in prison. He is a somnambulist who in his sleep assumes the role of various people of the ghetto, allowing Pernath to communicate with the outside world.
* Dr. Savioli: a wealthy neighbor of Pernath&#x27;s who rents a room in the ghetto from Zwakh; there he carries on illicit affairs with married women.

=== Minor characters ===
*The Regiment, a local criminal organization
*Dr. Wassory
*Angelina

==Reception==
In his &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; essay, H. P. Lovecraft said the novel is one of the &quot;best examples&quot; of Jewish folklore–inspired weird fiction. Also, in a letter, he called it, &quot;[t]he most magnificent weird thing I&#x27;ve come across in aeons!&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Golem&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #80, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s the sort of nightmare you might have after an evening of too much lobster and Kafka. Very strange.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; writer David Barnett said in his article about the novel that it is &quot;one of the most absorbing, atmospheric and mind-boggling slices of fantasy ever committed to print,&quot; and &quot;[a] century after its first publication, &quot;The Golem&quot; endures as a piece of modernist fantasy that deserves to take its place alongside Kafka.&quot;

==English translations==
Since &quot;The Golem&quot; was first published in German, there have been at least three translations into English:
* Madge Pemberton (1928): First published by Houghton Mifflin Co. and Victor Gollancz Ltd. Published by Mudra in 1972. Published by Dover Publications in 1976. Published by Dedalus Ltd in 1985. Published by Centipede Press in 2012.
* Mike Mitchell (1995): First published by Ariadne Press. Published by Dedalus Ltd in 2000. Published by Tartarus Press in 2004. Published by Folio Society in 2010.
* Isabel Cole (2007): Published by Vitalis. 

The Dover Publications edition was edited by E. F. Bleiler, who made some alterations to Pemberton&#x27;s translation.

==Adaptation for film and theatre ==
The novel was the basis for the following movies:
*&quot;Golem&quot;, directed by Piotr Szulkin, made in 1979, released in 1980.
*&quot;Le Golem&quot; (1967), film for television directed by Jean Kerchbron

The novel was adapted for the theatre by Daniel Flint, and received a world premiere in 2013.

<doc id="1297107" wikidata="Q7119591" url="?curid=1297107" title="Urokinase">
<text>Urokinase, also known as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, and it is also present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.

Urokinase is encoded in humans by the &quot;PLAU&quot; gene, which stands for &quot;plasminogen activator, urokinase&quot;. The same symbol represents the gene in other animal species.

== Function ==
The &quot;PLAU&quot; gene encodes a serine protease () involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and possibly tumor cell migration and proliferation. A specific polymorphism in this gene may be associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease and also with decreased affinity for fibrin-binding. The protein encoded by this gene converts plasminogen to plasmin by specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. This gene&#x27;s proprotein is cleaved at a Lys-Ile bond by plasmin to form a two-chain derivative in which a single disulfide bond connects the amino-terminal A-chain to the catalytically active, carboxy-terminal B-chain. This two-chain derivative is also called HMW-uPA (high molecular weight uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into LMW-uPA (low molecular weight uPA) by cleavage of chain A into a short chain A (A1) and an amino-terminal fragment. LMW-uPA is proteolytically active but does not bind to the uPA receptor.

== Structure ==
Urokinase is a 411-residue protein, consisting of three domains: the serine protease domain (consisting of residues 159–411), the kringle domain (consisting of residues 50-131), and the EGF-like domain (consisting of residues 1-49). The kringle domain and the serine protease domain are connected by an interdomain linker or connecting peptide (consisting of residues 132–158). Urokinase is synthesized as a zymogen form (prourokinase or single-chain urokinase), and is activated by proteolytic cleavage between Lys158 and Ile159. The two resulting chains are kept together by a disulfide bond between Cys148 and Cys279.

In comparison to the mammalian system, zebrafish (Danio rerio) contains two orthologs of urokinase which have been characterised as zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b. zfuPA-a differs from the mammalian uPA by lacking an exon sequence encoding for the uPAR (urokinase receptor) binding domain; while the zfuPA-b lacks two cysteines of the epidermal growth factor-like domain. zfuPA-b also has no binding activity in fish white blood cells or fish cell lines. The uPAR binding in mammalian system is essential for the activity of urokinase and uPAR as it also functions as an adhesion receptor due to its affinity to vitronectin, integrins and other proteases like PAI-1. The lack of the uPAR binding region in zebrafish uPA, suggests that zebrafish uPA functions without uPAR binding.

== Interaction partners ==
The most important inhibitors of urokinase are the serpins plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2), which inhibit the protease activity irreversibly. In the extracellular matrix, urokinase is tethered to the cell membrane by its interaction to the urokinase receptor.

uPa also interacts with protein C inhibitor.

zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b are poor activators of human plasminogen, while human uPA is a poor activator of salmon plasminogen. With the primary difference between the zebrafish uPA and human uPA being in the EGF domain.

== Urokinase and cancer ==
Elevated expression levels of urokinase and several other components of the plasminogen activation system are found to be correlated with tumor malignancy. It is believed that the tissue degradation following plasminogen activation facilitates tissue invasion and, thus, contributes to metastasis. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is more commonly associated with cancer progression than tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This makes uPA an attractive drug target, and, so, inhibitors have been sought to be used as anticancer agents. However, incompatibilities between the human and murine systems hamper clinical evaluation of these agents. Moreover, urokinase is used by normal cells for tissue remodeling and vessel growth, which necessitates distinguishing cancer-associated urokinase features for specific targeting.

uPA breakdown of the extracellular matrix is crucial for initiating the angiogenesis which is associated with cancer growth.

uPA antigen is elevated in breast cancer tissue, which correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. For this reason, uPA can be used as a diagnostic biomarker in breast cancer.

Through its interaction with the urokinase receptor, urokinase affects several other aspects of cancer biology such as cell adhesion, migration, and cellular mitotic pathways.

As of December 7, 2012, Mesupron (upamostat), a small molecule serine protease inhibitor developed by the WILEX pharmaceutical company, has completed phase II trials. Mesupron appears to be safe when combined with chemotherapeutic drug Capecitabine for the progression-free survival in human breast cancer.

== Clinical applications ==
Urokinase is effective for the restoration of flow to intravenous catheters blocked by clotted blood or fibrin (catheter clearance). Catheters are used extensively to administer treatments to patients for such purposes as dialysis, nutrition, antibiotic treatment and cancer treatment. Approximately 25% of catheters become blocked, meaning that affected patients cannot receive treatment until the catheter has been cleared or replaced. Urokinase is also used clinically as a thrombolytic agent in the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction (AMI, heart attack), and occluded dialysis cannulas (catheter clearance). It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Kinlytic (formerly Abbokinase) and competes with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug.

All plasminogen activators (urokinase, tPA) catalyze the production of plasmin, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the fibrin mesh structure in blood clots.  While there are commonalities in the mode of action for urokinase and tPA, urokinase has some advantages for treatment of peripheral clots (Pulmonary Embolism, Deep Vein Thrombosis, Peripheral arterial occlusive disease).

Unlike tPA, which is activated by binding to the fibrin within clots, urokinase is not sequestered by fibrin and therefore does not specifically attack hemostatic clots.  This makes urokinase less likely to break down such hemostatic clots that are essential for ongoing blood vessel repair throughout the body.  Dissolution of these “good” clots can lead to serious adverse events through hemorrhagic bleeding.  Years of clinical study have confirmed the safety advantage of using urokinase. Consequently, urokinase has been preferentially used in deep venous thrombosis and peripheral arterial occlusive disease where it is administered directly to the site of the clot while tPA is preferred in AMI where peripheral bleeding is a secondary consideration.  

A revolutionary method for the production of urokinase was patented by Evelyn Nicol in 1976 (U.S. Patent No. 3,930,944). Nicol was believed to be the first African American woman to receive a molecular biology patent.

==Society and culture==
The presence of a fibrinolytic enzyme in human urine was reported in 1947, without a name given for such an enzyme behind its effect. In 1952 a purified form of the enzyme was extracted from human urine and named &quot;urokinase&quot; for &quot;urinary kinase&quot;. The full text for this article is lost, and the only citation points to the abstract of a list of papers read at a conference in the same journal. A few other papers on the purification were published independently around the same time. By 1960, it was still unclear whether the activation of plasminogen has anything to do with a protease, but a kinase is thought to play a role regardless.

<text>Alfonso Darío Pereyra Bueno (born 19 October 1956) is a Uruguayan former football player. Having played as a midfielder for Club Nacional de Football in his home country, he reached stardom playing for São Paulo FC as a centre-back along with Oscar. He is still remembered and revered as one of the best centre-backs in the history of Brazilian football.

Legend has it that, whilst returning from a victory in an away match that crowned São Paulo the Brazilian champions, he wouldn&#x27;t understand what the fuss was all about, but the supporters would not let him sleep. He had won a few times the national championship in Uruguay, so he felt that winning the Brazilian championship was nothing special. He later realized how difficult it is to win a Brazilian National title. It had been the first time São Paulo F.C. won that championship.

==Career==

===Playing career===
Darío Pereyra started his career at the Nacional de Montevideo and debuted at the Uruguay national squad when he was only 18, becoming the captain of the national team at 19. After having scored 14 goals in 34 matches for the Nacional, São Paulo F.C. hired him on 17 October 1977 for 5 million cruzeiros, the second largest sum to be ever paid for a player at the time in Brazil. He arrived at the Congonhas airport wearing a São Paulo jersey, and was received warmly by the supporters of that team. Pereyra was not able to play immediately after his arrival, for he did not have the necessary documentation to do so. In December 1977, Real Madrid CF made an offer that could have cut his São Paulo career short, but the player was not interested in playing in Spain at that particular time.

Throughout his time at São Paulo, he and Oscar, who was also a centre-back, became a line of defence that is frequently remembered as one of the best in that club&#x27;s history. He played a total of 451 matches in that club, scoring 38 goals. After the 1988 São Paulo state championship, Pereyra has transferred to Flamengo, where he played only 11 matches. After that, he was hired by Palmeiras in early 1989, when he was already 32. In the following year, he played for two years at Gamba Osaka, then called Matsushita Electronic, where he would end his playing career.

Darío Pereyra also made regular appearances in the Uruguay national team, and has played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

===Managerial career===
Darío was an assistant manager at São Paulo when he took over the interim manager position in 1997, succeeding manager Muricy Ramalho. Under his management, São Paulo shook off a weak campaign in the São Paulo State Championship, but the team only obtained the vice-championship title and a 13th position in the Campeonato Brasileiro. After 1998, Pereyra was replaced by manager Nelsinho Baptista.

On 3 October 1998, Pereyra was the fifth manager to take up Coritiba in that very year. However, he managed to lead the team to six victories and five draws in 13 matches. At the end of the 1998 Brazilian championship, he managed Atlético Mineiro, where he eventually obtained the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1999.

===Personal life===
Pereyra is currently employed by football marketing company Traffic in Brazil as a supervisor responsible for discovering talented, young football players.

<doc id="1297120" wikidata="Q1662098" url="?curid=1297120" title="Corporate bond">
<text>A corporate bond is a bond issued by a corporation in order to raise financing for a variety of reasons such as to ongoing operations, mergers &amp; acquisitions, or to expand business. It is a longer-term debt instrument indicating that a corporation has borrowed a certain amount of money and promises to repay it in the future under specific terms. Corporate debt instruments with maturity shorter than one year are referred to as commercial paper.

== Definition ==
A corporate bond is a bond issued by a corporation in order to raise financing for a variety of reasons such as to ongoing operations, mergers &amp; acquisitions, or to expand business. The term sometimes also encompasses bonds issued by supranational organizations (such as European Bank for Reconstruction and Development). Strictly speaking, however, it only applies to those issued by corporations. The bonds of local authorities (municipal bonds) are not included.

== Trading ==
Corporate bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based, over-the-counter markets. In over-the-counter trading dealers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Corporate bonds may be publicly listed (these are called &quot;listed&quot; bonds). However, the vast majority of trading volume happens over-the-counter.

== High grade versus high yield ==
Corporate bonds are divided into two main categories High Grade (also called Investment Grade) and High Yield (also called Non-Investment Grade, Speculative Grade, or Junk Bonds) according to their credit rating. Bonds rated AAA, AA, A, and BBB are High Grade, while bonds rated BB and below are High Yield. This is a significant distinction as High Grade and High Yield bonds are traded by different trading desks and held by different investors. For example, many pension funds and insurance companies are prohibited from holding more than a token amount of High Yield bonds (by internal rules or government regulation). The distinction between High Grade and High Yield is also common to most corporate bond markets.

== Bond types ==
The coupon (i.e. interest payment) is usually taxable for the investor. It is tax deductible for the corporation paying it. For US dollar corporates, the coupon is almost always semiannual, while Euro denominated corporates pay coupon quarterly.

The coupon can be zero. In this case the bond, a zero-coupon bond, is sold at a discount (i.e. a $100 face value bond sold initially for $80). The investor benefits by paying $80, but collecting $100 at maturity. The $20 gain (ignoring time value of money) is in lieu of the regular coupon. However, this is rare for corporate bonds.

Some corporate bonds have an embedded call option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt before its maturity date. These are called callable bonds. A less common feature is an embedded put option that allows investors to put the bond back to the issuer before its maturity date. These are called putable bonds. Both of these features are common to the High Yield market. High Grade bonds rarely have embedded options. A straight bond that is neither callable nor putable is called a bullet bond.

Other bonds, known as convertible bonds, allow investors to convert the bond into equity. They can also be secured or unsecured, senior or subordinated, and issued out of different parts of the company&#x27;s capital structure.

== Valuation ==

High grade corporate bonds usually trade at market interest rate but low grade corporate bonds usually trade on credit spread. Credit spread is the difference in yield between the corporate bond and a Government bond of similar maturity or duration (e.g. for US Dollar corporates, US Treasury bonds). It is essentially the extra yield an investor earns over a risk free instrument as a compensation for the extra risk: thus, the better the quality of the bond, the smaller the spread between its required return and the yield to maturity (YTM) of the benchmark; see § Risk analysis below.This increased required return is then used to discount the bond&#x27;s cash flows, using the present value formula for bonds, to obtain the bond&#x27;s price. See for discussion, and for the math, Bond valuation.

== Derivatives ==
The most common derivative on corporate bonds are called credit default swaps (CDS) which are contracts between two parties that provide a synthetic exposure with similar risks to owning the bond. The bond that the CDS is based on is called the Reference Entity and the difference between the credit spread of the bond and the spread of the CDS is called the Bond-CDS basis.

== Risk analysis ==
===Default risk===
Compared to government bonds, corporate bonds generally have a higher risk of default. This risk depends on the particular corporation issuing the bond, the current market conditions and governments to which the bond issuer is being compared and the rating of the company. Corporate bond holders are compensated for this risk by receiving a higher yield than government bonds. The difference in yield - called credit spread - reflects the higher probability of default, the expected loss in the event of default, and may also reflect liquidity and risk premia; see Bond credit rating, High-yield debt.
=== Other risks ===
Additional to default risk, as outlined, there are other risks for which corporate bondholders expect to be compensated through an increased credit spread. This explains, for example, the Option Adjusted Spread on a Ginnie Mae MBS relative to the Treasury curve.
* Credit Spread Risk: The risk that the credit spread of a bond (extra yield to compensate investors for taking default risk), which is inherent in the fixed coupon, becomes insufficient compensation for default risk that has later deteriorated. As the coupon is fixed the only way the credit spread can readjust to new circumstances is by the market price of the bond falling and the yield rising to such a level that an appropriate credit spread is offered. (See CS01.)
* Interest Rate Risk: The risk that level of Yields generally in a bond market, as expressed by Government Bond Yields, may change and thus bring about changes in the market value of Fixed-Coupon bonds so that their Yield to Maturity adjusts to newly appropriate levels. (See DV01, Bond duration and Bond convexity.)
* Liquidity Risk: There may not be a continuous secondary market for a bond, thus leaving an investor with difficulty in selling at, or even near to, a fair price. This particular risk could become more severe in developing markets, where a large amount of junk bonds belong, such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc.
* Supply Risk: Heavy issuance of new bonds similar to the one held may depress their prices.
* Inflation Risk: Inflation reduces the real value of future fixed cash flows. An anticipation of inflation, or higher inflation, may depress prices immediately.
* Tax Change Risk: Unanticipated changes in taxation may adversely impact the value of a bond to investors and consequently its immediate market value.

== Corporate bond indices ==
Corporate bond indices include the Barclays Corporate Bond Index, S&amp;P U.S. Issued Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index (SPUSCIG), the Citigroup US Broad Investment Grade Credit Index, the JPMorgan US Liquid Index (JULI), and the Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index.

== Corporate bond market transparency ==
Speaking in 2005, SEC Chief Economist Chester S. Spatt offered the following opinion on the transparency of corporate bond markets:

Frankly, I find it surprising that there has been so little attention to pre-trade transparency in the design of the U.S. bond markets. While some might argue that this is a consequence of the degree of fragmentation in the bond market, I would point to options markets and European bond markets-which are similarly fragmented, but much more transparent on a pre-trade basis.

A combination of mathematical and regulatory initiatives are aimed at addressing pre-trade transparency in the U.S. corporate bond markets.

==Foreign-currency denominated bonds==
In February 2015 it was expected that Apple Inc. would issue its corporate bonds in Swiss francs, as the yields of Switzerland&#x27;s government bonds went negative. Taking advantage of the very low borrowing costs, the computer maker intended to sell CHF-denominated bonds for the first time. The California-based company did sell positive-yield and Swiss franc-denominated bonds on 10 February 2015, borrowing CHF 1.25 billion (nearly equivalent to US$1.35 billion). It was thought that the company aimed to expand its total shareholder return more in 2015 than in 2014.

<text>Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite (; born 22 April 1982), commonly known as Kaká () or Ricardo Kaká, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. In his prime at AC Milan, where he was known for his passing, goalscoring, and dribbling, Kaká was widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation. He is also regarded as one of the greatest midfielders in the history of the sport. With success for both club and country, he is one of the nine players to win the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League, and the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

In 2001, at age 18, Kaká made his professional debut at Brazilian club São Paulo. He later joined Italian club AC Milan in 2003. Kaká helped Milan win the Serie A title in his first season. Milan finished runner-up in the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League with Kaká being the top assist provider of the tournament and being named the UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year. He led Milan to win the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League and was the tournament&#x27;s top goalscorer. His performances saw him win the FIFA World Player of the Year, the 2007 Ballon d&#x27;Or, and the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year. After six years with Milan, Kaká joined Real Madrid in 2009 for a transfer fee of €67 million, which was the second highest transfer fee at the time. However, his four seasons in Madrid were plagued with injuries, which saw his pace decline. He returned to AC Milan for a single season in 2013, prior to joining MLS expansion club Orlando City SC. He initially went on loan to his former club São Paulo before returning to Orlando in 2015 and retiring from professional football in 2017.

Kaká made his debut for the Brazil national team in 2002 and was selected for the 2002 FIFA World Cup squad, which won the tournament that year. He also played in the 2006 World Cup, alongside other veterans like Ronaldo, Adriano, and Ronaldinho. He made his final World Cup appearance in 2010. He was also a member of Brazil&#x27;s 2005 and 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup-winning squads, winning the Golden Ball in 2009 as the tournament&#x27;s best player.

Between 2006 and 2009, he was named in both the FIFA World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year three times. In 2010, he was named in the AC Milan Hall of Fame. One of the world&#x27;s most famous athletes during his playing career, Kaká was the first sportsperson to amass 10 million followers on Twitter. Outside of football, Kaká is known for his humanitarian work, where he became the youngest ambassador of the UN World Food Programme in 2004. For his contributions on and off the pitch, Kaká was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people in 2008 and in 2009.

==Early life==
Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite was born on 22 April, 1982 in Gama in the Federal District of the Central-West Region of Brazil to Simone dos Santos, an elementary school teacher, and Bosco Izecson Pereira Leite, a civil engineer. His family was financially secure, which allowed him to focus on school and football at the same time. His younger brother Digão and cousin Eduardo Delani are also professional footballers. Digão called him &quot;Caca&quot; due to his inability to pronounce &quot;Ricardo&quot; when they were young; it eventually evolved into &quot;Kaká.&quot; The word has no specific Portuguese translation.

When he was seven, Kaká&#x27;s family moved to São Paulo in the homonymous state. His school had arranged him in a local youth club called &quot;&quot;Alphaville&quot;,&quot; who qualified to the final in a local tournament. There, he was discovered by hometown club São Paulo FC, who offered him a place in the youth academy. At the age of 18, Kaká suffered a career-threatening spinal fracture as a result of a swimming pool accident, but made a full recovery. He attributes his recovery to God and has since tithed his income to his church.

==Club career==

===São Paulo===

Kaká began his career with São Paulo at the age of eight. He signed a contract at 15 and led the São Paulo youth squad to &quot;Copa de Juvenil&quot; glory. He made his senior side debut on 1 February 2001 and scored 12 goals in 27 appearances, in addition to leading São Paulo to its first and only Torneio Rio-São Paulo championship, in which he scored two goals in two minutes as a substitute against Botafogo in the final, which São Paulo won 2–1.

He scored ten goals in 22 matches the following season, and by this time his performance was soon attracting attention from European clubs. Kaká made a total of 58 appearances for São Paulo, scoring 23 times.

===AC Milan===
The steady European interest in Kaká culminated in his signing with the European champions, Italian club AC Milan, in 2003 for a fee of reported €8.5 million, described in retrospect as &quot;peanuts&quot; by club owner Silvio Berlusconi. Within a month, he cracked the starting lineup, replacing Rui Costa in the attacking midfield playmaking position, behind strikers Jon Dahl Tomasson, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko. His Serie A debut was in a 2–0 win over Ancona. He scored ten goals in 30 appearances that season, also providing several important assists, such as the cross which led to Shevchenko&#x27;s title-deciding headed goal, as Milan won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; and the UEFA Super Cup, whilst finishing as runner up in the Intercontinental Cup and the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana. Milan also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual winners Lazio, and were knocked out of the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo La Coruña. Due to his performances in his debut season, in 2004, Kaká was named Serie A Footballer of the Year, and was nominated for both the Ballon d&#x27;Or (finishing 15th) and the 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year (finishing 10th).

Kaká was a part of the five-man midfield in the 2004–05 season, usually playing in a withdrawn role behind striker Andriy Shevchenko. He was supported by Gennaro Gattuso and Clarence Seedorf defensively, as well as Massimo Ambrosini, allowing Kaká as the attacking midfielder and Rui Costa or Andrea Pirlo as the deep-lying playmaker to be in charge of creating Milan&#x27;s goalscoring chances, forming a formidable midfield unit in both Italy and Europe. Milan began the season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Lazio. He scored seven goals in 36 domestic appearances as Milan finished runner-up in the &quot;Scudetto&quot; race. Milan also reached the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia that season. Kaká played a pivotal role in Milan&#x27;s Champions League campaign that season, helping them to reach the final against Liverpool, scoring two goals and providing five assists. Dubbed the &quot;Miracle of Istanbul&quot;, Milan led 3–0 at half time, before Liverpool staged a comeback, scoring three goals in six minutes, and eventually won the match 3–2 on penalties. A match widely regarded as one of the greatest finals in the competition&#x27;s history, Kaká was imperious in the first half; he first won the early free-kick which led to Paolo Maldini&#x27;s opening goal, began the play that led to Hernán Crespo&#x27;s first goal and Milan&#x27;s second of the night, then executed a long curling pass that split open the Liverpool defence and rolled directly into the path of Crespo to score Milan&#x27;s third. Kaká was once again nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year Awards, finishing ninth and eighth respectively, and he was named the 2005 UEFA Club Football Best Midfielder.
The 2005–06 season saw Kaká score his first hat-tricks in domestic competitions. On 9 April 2006, he scored his first &quot;Rossoneri&quot; hat-trick against Chievo, with all three goals scored in the second half. Milan were knocked out in the semi-finals of the 2005–06 Champions League to eventual champions Barcelona, and were once again eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia. Milan also finished once again as runners-up in Serie A, with Kaká scoring 17 goals in the league. After the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, however, Milan were deducted 30 points, which placed them in third in the table. Kaká was nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year Awards for the third consecutive year, finishing 11th and seventh respectively. He was also selected to be part of both the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFPro World XI for the first time in his career.

Andriy Shevchenko&#x27;s departure to Chelsea for the 2006–07 season allowed Kaká to become the focal point of Milan&#x27;s offense as he alternated between the midfield and forward positions, operating at times as a striker or as a second striker behind Filippo Inzaghi, as well as in his more typical attacking midfield position. On 2 November 2006, he scored his first Champions League hat-trick in a 4–1 group stage win over the Belgian side Anderlecht. He finished as the top scorer in the 2006–07 Champions League campaign with ten goals. One of the goals helped the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; eliminate Celtic in the round of 16, 1–0 on aggregate, and he scored three goals against Manchester United in the semi-finals. Milan also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia that season, losing out to winners Roma, and finished fourth in Serie A.
Kaká won the Champions League title when Milan defeated Liverpool 2–1 on 23 May 2007, avenging the previous loss on penalties two years before. Though he went scoreless, he won a free kick that led to the first of Filippo Inzaghi&#x27;s two goals, and provided the assist for the second. On 30 August, Kaká was named by UEFA as both the top forward of the 2006–07 Champions League season and UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, as well as being named as part of the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time. He once again finished as the second-best assist-provider of the Champions League, providing five, and was voted the 2007 IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Playmaker.

Milan began its 2007–08 season by winning the UEFA Super Cup on 31 August, defeating Sevilla 3–1, with Kaká scoring the third goal. Kaká had made a dribbling run into Sevilla&#x27;s area, winning a penalty, which he then proceeded to take. Although it was saved by goalkeeper Andrés Palop, Kaká scored on the rebound with a header. Kaká had previously hit the post in the first half. He played his 200th career match with Milan in a 1–1 home draw with Catania on 30 September, scoring from a penalty, and on 5 October, he was named the 2006–07 FIFPro World Player of the Year, and was elected as part of the FIFPro World XI for the second time in his career. On 2 December 2007, Kaká became the eighth Milan player to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or, as he finished with a decisive 444 votes, well ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He signed a contract extension through 2013 with Milan on 29 February 2008.
On 16 December, Kaká won the FIFA Club World Cup against Boca Juniors, scoring Milan&#x27;s third goal of the match in a 4–2 victory which allowed them to be crowned World Champions. Kaká had previously assisted Filippo Inzaghi&#x27;s opening goal of the match and also assisted Inzaghi&#x27;s final goal of the match after an impressive exchange with Clarence Seedorf; he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the competition. On 17 December, Kaká was voted the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year with 1,047 votes, ahead of Lionel Messi with 504 and Cristiano Ronaldo with 426.
In January 2008, Kaká was also named the 2007 Serie A Footballer of the Year, winning the award for the second time in his career. His contributions on and off the pitch saw &quot;Time&quot; magazine name Kaká in the Time 100 list on 2 May. On 14 October, he cast his footprints into the Estádio do Maracanã&#x27;s sidewalk of fame, in a section dedicated to the memory of the country&#x27;s top players. Kaká finished the 2007–08 season with 15 goals in Serie A. His best goals included a curling strike from 30 yards into the top corner against Lazio, a powerful strike from the edge of the 18-yard box against Cagliari, and a now trademark slalom run past a number of Udinese players before bending the ball into the bottom corner. He was nominated as a finalist for the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, finishing fourth, and was nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or, finishing in eighth. He was named in the six-man shortlist for the 2008 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, and was selected in the FIFPro World XI for the third time in his career. He was named in the Time 100 again in 2009.

The BBC reported on 13 January 2009 that Manchester City made a bid for Kaká for over £100 million. Milan Director Umberto Gandini replied that Milan would only discuss the matter if Kaká and Manchester City agreed to personal terms. Kaká initially responded by telling reporters he wanted to &quot;grow old&quot; at Milan and dreamed of captaining the club one day, but later said, &quot;If Milan want to sell me, I&#x27;ll sit down and talk. I can say that as long as the club don&#x27;t want to sell me, I&#x27;ll definitely stay.&quot; On 19 January, Silvio Berlusconi announced that Manchester City had officially ended their bid after a discussion between the clubs, and that Kaká would remain with Milan. Milan supporters had protested outside the club headquarters earlier that evening, and later chanted outside Kaká&#x27;s home, where he saluted them by flashing his jersey outside a window. Kaká finished his final season with Milan by scoring 16 goals, helping Milan finish third in Serie A, and once again being elected as a finalist for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award, finishing fourth in voting for the second-straight year. He was also nominated for the Ballon d&#x27;Or award, finishing in sixth place, and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career.

===Real Madrid===

On 3 June 2009, it was reported that newly elected Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez had offered to buy Kaká from Milan for a reported €68.5 million, two days after the player had left for international duty with Brazil. Milan vice-chairman and CEO Adriano Galliani confirmed that he and Kaká&#x27;s father, Bosco Leite, had traveled to Mexico to meet with &quot;La Volpe&quot;: &quot;We had lunch and spoke about Kaká. I don&#x27;t deny it. Negotiations exist, but a deal has yet to be done.&quot; On 4 June, Galliani told &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; that financial reasons were his motive for the talks with &quot;La Volpe&quot;: &quot;We cannot allow [Milan] to lose €70 million ... The reasons behind Kaká&#x27;s departure would be economic.&quot; On 8 June, Milan and Real Madrid confirmed Kaká&#x27;s move to the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on a six-year deal for €67 million fee.

Kaká was unveiled as a Real Madrid player on 30 June 2009, and he made his unofficial debut on 7 August 2009 in a 5–1 friendly victory against Toronto FC. He scored his first goal for Madrid during a pre-season match on 19 August 2009, in a 5–0 victory against Borussia Dortmund. Kaká later made his league debut on 29 August 2009 in a 3–2 win against Deportivo de La Coruña. He scored his first goal, a penalty, on 23 September in a 2–0 win against Villarreal. Real Madrid finished the season as runners-up in La Liga, with Kaká scoring eight goals and providing six assists in La Liga, and nine goals and eight assists in all competitions.
On 5 August 2010, Real Madrid announced that Kaká had undergone a successful surgery on a long-standing left knee injury and would face up to four months on the sidelines. Kaká returned to training after a long lay-off, with manager José Mourinho commenting that having Kaká back from injury was like a new signing. After an eight-month absence, Kaká returned to play by entering as a substitute for Karim Benzema on the 77th minute of a 3–2 victory over Getafe on 3 January 2011. He said he was &quot;(...) happy for playing a game again and for stepping onto a pitch.&quot; His first league goal (and his first of the season) after his return from injury came with an assist from Cristiano Ronaldo on a 4–2 victory over Villarreal on 9 January 2011.

In March 2011, Kaká suffered from Iliotibial band syndrome, which kept him sidelined for a few weeks. After returning from injury, he appeared in a convincing win over Valencia, scoring two goals. At the end of his second season with the club, Real Madrid and Kaká had won the Copa del Rey, although they finished as runners-up in both La Liga and in the Supercopa de España to rivals Barcelona. Real Madrid were also knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona in the semi-finals of the competition. Kaká finished his season with seven goals and six assists in all competitions in 20 appearances.
On 27 September 2011, Kaká experienced one of his best matches as a Real Madrid player during a 3–0 victory over Ajax in the Champions League, as he scored one goal, provided one assist and participated in one of the best team build-ups of the matchday: a counterattacking move involving Mesut Özil, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. Kaká was later chosen the best player of the Champions League Matchday. With this match, Kaká experienced one of the best starts to a season he has ever had, scoring two goals, serving two assists and winning one penalty for his team. In 2011–12, Real Madrid won La Liga with a record 100 points that year, with Kaká providing nine assists and scoring five goals in the competition. They were, however, eliminated for the second year in a row in the semi-finals of the Champions League, losing out to eventual runners-up Bayern Munich on penalties. The decisive misses for Real Madrid were by Ronaldo, Kaká and Sergio Ramos. He finished the season with eight goals and 14 assists in all club competitions. Real Madrid were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey by eventual winners Barcelona.
Real Madrid began the 2012–13 season by winning the 2012 Supercopa de España against rivals Barça. On 4 December 2012, after scoring in a 4–1 win against Ajax, Kaká became the top Brazilian goalscorer in Champions League history, with 28 goals. After the match, Kaká said, &quot;This was an important goal for me, and I hope I&#x27;ve still got goals left to help Real Madrid. It was an important win and a special night.&quot; Kaká came on just before an hour was played, but was sent off as he was booked twice within 18 minutes in a 0–0 draw against Osasuna on 12 January 2013. It was his first sending-off at Madrid since he joined from Milan in 2009 and his first red card since he was dismissed playing for Brazil against Ivory Coast at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Real Madrid finished the season in second place in La Liga behind Barcelona, and also finished runners-up in the Copa del Rey to city rivals Atlético Madrid. They were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Champions League for the third consecutive year by eventual runners-up Borussia Dortmund.

On 29 August 2013, Kaká expressed his desire to leave Real Madrid, having scored 29 goals and provided 32 assists in 120 appearances in all competitions over four seasons at the club. He said goodbye to Real Madrid and its fans in an open letter on Twitter.

===Return to AC Milan===
Milan confirmed that Kaká would join the club on 2 September 2013 from Real Madrid on a free transfer with only performance-related incentives owed to Madrid; after agreeing to personal terms, he signed a two-year contract. Kaká&#x27;s contract was worth €4 million net per year and he was given the number 22 shirt, the same number he wore for Milan during his first spell. He was also made the vice-captain upon his arrival. He captained Milan in his debut for his second spell, taking the armband from goalkeeper Marco Amelia in a match against Chiasso.

Kaká tore his left adductor muscle during his first competitive appearance, deciding not to accept any wages from Milan whilst he regained fitness. He made his return for Milan on 19 October after coming on as a 76th-minute substitute in a 1–0 home victory against Udinese. In his next match, on 22 October, Kaká assisted Robinho in the 1–1 home draw against Barcelona in the Champions League. His first goal, described by ESPN as &quot;a sensational curling shot from the edge of the area into the top right-hand corner,&quot; opened the scoring in a 1–1 home draw at San Siro to Lazio on 30 October. On 7 January 2014, Kaká scored his 100th goal for Milan by an opening goal in a match against Atalanta; he later went on to score another goal 30 minutes later. On 11 March he scored a goal against Atlético Madrid in Vicente Calderón Stadium, this goal made him the last player to score against Atlético Madrid at Vicente Calderón for three seasons in knockout phase until Isco scored against them in 2016–17 UEFA Champions League semi final. On 29 March 2014, Kaká scored twice in a 3–0 win against Chievo, his 300th match for Milan.

In June 2014, it was reported that Kaká had entered into advanced discussions with Orlando City SC to join the team in January 2015 when they enter Major League Soccer (MLS).
On 30 June 2014, Kaká had his Milan contract terminated through mutual consent despite having a year remaining, by activating a release clause as a result of the team not qualifying for European competitions.

===Orlando City===
Kaká joined future MLS franchise Orlando City as their first Designated Player. He stated that he had &quot;always&quot; wanted to play in the United States, and cited the Brazilian owner Flávio Augusto da Silva as a reason for signing. Until Orlando entered the league in 2015, Kaká was loaned to his first club São Paulo, which he called &quot;really satisfying&quot;.

By signing for Orlando City, Kaká became the highest-paid player in MLS history, with a base salary of US$6.6 million per year, and with a guaranteed compensation of $7.2 million per year.

====Loan to São Paulo====
On 3 July 2014, Kaká arrived at São Paulo and began training the next day. He made his comeback in a league match against Goiás on 27 July 2014, starting and scoring a goal in the 76th minute, although his team lost 2–1. On 4 September 2014, in the second round of the Copa Sudamericana, Kaká scored in a 2–0 victory over Criciúma. On 9 November 2014, Kaká scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Vitória.

==== Return to Orlando City ====

Kaká scored in his first match for Orlando City, a 4–0 friendly win over FC Dallas. He then scored again in a 1–1 friendly draw against New York City FC. On 8 March 2015, Kaká scored a free kick for the equaliser in a 1–1 draw on his MLS debut against New York City FC at the Citrus Bowl, the first in Orlando City&#x27;s competitive history. Kaká scored one and assisted another in a 2–2 draw with Montreal Impact on 28 March 2015. He came second in the &quot;Etihad Airways MLS Player of the Month &quot;poll&quot; &quot;for his performances in March.

On 13 April 2015, Kaká scored a penalty against Portland Timbers in a 2–0 win. On 17 May 2015, Kaká scored one and assisted another in Orlando City&#x27;s 4–0 win over defending MLS champions LA Galaxy. By doing so, Orlando became the first expansion team to beat a defending MLS champion by more than a three-goal margin. On 30 June, Kaká scored Orlando&#x27;s opening goal in the 21st minute of his Open Cup debut, helping his team to a 2–0 home win over Columbus Crew, in the fifth round of the competition, which enabled the club to advance to the quarter-finals. On 5 July, he received the first straight red card of his career in a 1–1 away draw against Real Salt Lake; he had previously scored a goal during the match. Later that month, Kaká was named to the 2015 MLS All-Star Game as the team&#x27;s captain. During the MLS All-Star Game on 29 July, at the Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado, he scored from a penalty and later assisted David Villa as the MLS All-Stars defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2–1; Kaká was named MVP of the match. Despite his efforts, he was unable to help Orlando City become the first expansion team to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs since Seattle Sounders FC in 2009, as Orlando narrowly missed out on the sixth seed spot in the Eastern Conference; he ended his first season with 9 goals and 7 assists in 28 MLS appearances, also scoring another goal from two appearances in the 2015 MLS Open Cup.
After initially being sidelined through injury and missing Orlando City&#x27;s first three matches of the 2016 MLS season, Kaká returned to the team&#x27;s starting line-up and made his first appearance of the season on 3 April, against the Portland Timbers; he assisted two goals and later scored one himself in a 4–1 home victory, and was subsequently named Player of the Week for his performance. In July 2016, he was included in the roster for the 2016 MLS All-Star Game. He finished his second MLS season with the club with 9 goals and 10 assists in 24 appearances, as Orlando once again failed to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs.

On 5 March 2017, in Orlando City&#x27;s opening match of the MLS season against New York City, and the club&#x27;s stadium debut, Kaká hit the turf clutching his left leg just minutes after the game had started; the Lions beat their opponents 1–0. Later, it was reported that Kaká would be out for 6 weeks due to a hamstring strain. Kaká came back in action and he scored on his return in Orlando City 2–0 win over Colorado Rapids on 29 April. The next week, he scored another goal in Orlando&#x27;s 2–1 loss against Toronto FC. He scored his third goal of the season in a 2–2 draw against Sporting KC on 13 May 2017. On 14 June, he played in the 3–1 loss in U.S. Open Cup match against Miami FC which was coached by his former teammate Alessandro Nesta. On 17 June he assisted Matías Pérez García&#x27;s goal against Montreal Impact. The following match, he provided another assist for Scott Sutter last minute equalizer against Seattle Sounders. On 7 July, he was chosen to play for the 2017 MLS All-Star Game for the third consecutive season. On 6 October, Kaká was awarded Goal of the Week for his goal against the New England Revolution in a 6–1 rout nine days earlier.

Orlando City were officially eliminated from playoff contention on 7 October, following New York Red Bulls&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Kaká announced on 11 October 2017 that he would not be renewing his contract with Orlando City for the 2018 MLS season. He played his last official match for Orlando on 15 October in a 1–0 home defeat against Columbus Crew; he finished the 2017 MLS season with 6 goals and 5 assists in 23 league appearances. He later appeared once more for Orlando, in a 6–1 home win over the Puerto Rican national team in the &quot;Fuerza Puerto Rico&quot; friendly, held on 5 November, to raise money for Hurricane Maria relief. In total, Kaká made 75 league appearances in his three seasons with Orlando, scoring 24 goals and providing 22 assists.

===Retirement===
Kaká announced his retirement on 17 December 2017, after turning down offers from his former clubs São Paulo and AC Milan. He also expressed interest in working as a director, confirming that Milan had offered him a role.

==International career==
===Youth career and early senior career===
Kaká was called up for the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship, but the Brazilians crashed out to Ghana in the quarter-finals. Several months later, he made his debut for the senior Brazil squad in a friendly match against Bolivia on 31 January 2002. He was part of Brazil&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning squad in Korea/Japan, but played only 25 minutes, all of which were in the 5–2 first round victory against Costa Rica on 13 June.

In 2003, Kaká was the captain for the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup, where Brazil, competing with their under-23 team, finished as runner-up to Mexico. He scored three goals during the tournament.

===First Confederations Cup title and 2006 World Cup===
Kakà was included in Brazil&#x27;s squad for 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany. He appeared in all five matches and scored one goal in a 4–1 win over Argentina in the final.

Kaká started in his first FIFA World Cup finals in 2006 and scored his first and only goal of the tournament with a 25-yard strike in Brazil&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Croatia in Brazil&#x27;s opener, for which he was named Man of the Match. Kaká was unable to keep up the momentum for the remainder of the tournament, as Brazil was eliminated by France in the quarter-finals with French star Thierry Henry scoring the winner.

In a friendly against rivals Argentina at the Emirates Stadium, London on 3 September 2006, after entering as a substitute, Kaká received the ball off a deflection from an Argentina corner kick and outran Lionel Messi while taking the ball down three quarters of the field to score. Exhibiting his &quot;fantastic acceleration and balletic grace&quot; (according to Carl Anka for the BBC), Kaká regards it as the greatest goal he ever scored. On 12 May 2007, citing an exhaustive schedule of Serie A, Champions League and national team play, Kaká bowed out of the 2007 Copa América, which Brazil won. After missing out on the Copa América, he returned to play in Brazil&#x27;s friendly match against Algeria on 22 August 2007. On 11 October 2008, Kaká opened the scoring for Brazil in their 4–0 win against Venezuela in a qualification game for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

===Second Confederations Cup title and 2010 World Cup===
Kaká participated in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, wearing the number 10 shirt, marking his first international tournament since the 2006 World Cup. His only two goals came in Brazil&#x27;s group stage opener against Egypt on 14 June, when he scored a goal in the fifth minute and then added a 90th-minute penalty in Brazil&#x27;s 4–3 victory. Kaká also provided two assists throughout the tournament. He received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament at the Confederations Cup and was also named the Man of the Match in the final after helping Brazil to a 3–2 win against the United States.
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, during the match against Ivory Coast on 20 June, Kaká received a red card after receiving two yellow cards. The second card was given for an alleged elbow in the direction of Abdul Kader Keïta. Kaká ended the tournament with three assists in total, as the joint-top assist provider, although he failed to score a goal during the tournament. Brazil eventually ended up losing 2–1 to World Cup eventual runners-up Netherlands in the quarter-finals of the tournament.

===Later career===
After more than a year absence from the national team due to a series of injuries, Kaká was recalled on 27 October 2011 for the friendly matches against Gabon and Egypt in November. He later had to be removed from the squad due to a calf injury, and thus did not play either of the matches.

After not appearing for Brazil in two years, Kaká was recalled on 28 September 2012 for the friendly matches against Iraq and Japan in October. Following his recall to the &quot;Seleção&quot; squad, Kaká stated, &quot;I admit it was a surprise this call ... When the list was published, I was extremely happy. It was like my first call-up.&quot; Brazil coach Mano Menezes said that despite Kaká and Oscar&#x27;s similarities, the two would be able to play alongside each other, as Kaká had slightly changed his playing style. On his return to the national side, Kaká scored in both matches, a 6–0 win over Iraq and a 4–0 win over Japan. Kaká retained his place in the squad for Brazil&#x27;s 1,000th game in history, a 1–1 friendly draw against Colombia on 14 November 2012.

On 5 March 2013, Kaká was called up by new Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for the first time since the coach&#x27;s return, for friendlies with Italy in London and Russia in Geneva, both taking place late in that month. Kaká, however, was not selected for the national team for the 2013 Confederations Cup and was also omitted from Scolari&#x27;s 2014 World Cup squad. After almost 18 months, Kaká was recalled to the Brazilian team in October 2014 by new manager Dunga for friendlies against Argentina and Japan. On 1 May 2015, Kaká was selected as one of seven stand-by players in Brazil&#x27;s preliminary squad for the 2015 Copa América, although he was not called up for the final tournament. In August 2015, he was called up to the national team once again for the team&#x27;s international friendlies in September, and made a substitute appearance in Brazil&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Costa Rica on 5 September; this was his first appearance for Brazil in almost a year, and his 90th appearance for his country overall. Following Douglas Costa&#x27;s left thigh injury in late May 2016, which ruled him out of Brazil&#x27;s Copa América Centenario squad, Kaká was called up as a replacement by Dunga. On 30 May, he subsequently appeared as an 80th-minute substitute in a pre-Copa América friendly warm-up match against Panama, which ended in a 2–0 victory to Brazil. A muscle injury sustained in early June, however, also ruled Kaká out of the upcoming tournament; he was replaced by Ganso.

==Style of play and reception==
Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and one of the greatest midfielders in the history of the sport, Kaká has been described on the FIFA website as having the &quot;capacity to glide almost effortlessly past opponents, provide defence-splitting passes and score consistently from distance.&quot; In his prime at Milan and prior to the injuries he suffered at Real Madrid, Kaká was an intelligent, quick, and hardworking player that could dribble past defenders in one-on-one situations as well as during counterattacks. Regarding his speed and elegance on the ball during his trademark forward runs, in 2017, Karl Matchett of Bleacher Report stated:

Tim Vickery of ESPN wrote, &quot;Kaká running forward with the ball had the power of a freight train. He married power with finesse&quot;. He also wrote on the impact of his knee and groin issues at Madrid, adding, &quot;once his acceleration had been reduced, he lacked the subtlety to shine as before.&quot; Carl Anka of the BBC writes that his &quot;knee and groin problems sapped him of the explosive half-yard burst he needed to navigate the corridors of midfield uncertainty&quot;, and that by 2009, he &quot;was already on the wane.&quot; Anka adds that because he was the last player to win FIFA World Player of the Year (in 2007) prior to the Messi-Ronaldo dominance over the next decade, Kaká&#x27;s standing and recognition in football has been &quot;lost in a haze&quot;.

Ronaldinho states, &quot;For two, maybe three seasons [at Milan], he was the best player in the world. There was nothing he couldn&#x27;t do&quot;, while his Milan teammate Andrea Pirlo adds, &quot;There was a point when teams just had no idea how to stop him.&quot; Kaká was also renowned for his vision and passing, which allowed him to create goalscoring chances for teammates. Having played as an attacking midfielder throughout his career, Kaká could also play as a winger or as a deep-lying playmaker. In addition to these characteristics, Kaká also had a powerful and accurate strike with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed. He also had the ability to bend the ball and was an accurate penalty taker. In 2020, &quot;90min.com&quot; placed Kaká at number 42 in their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Footballers of All Time&quot;.

==Personal life==

Kaká married his childhood sweetheart Caroline Celico on 23 December 2005 at a Rebirth in Christ church in São Paulo. The couple have two children, a son and a daughter. In 2015, Kaká and Celico announced their divorce via social media.

Kaká gained Italian citizenship on 12 February 2007. He featured in many Adidas advertisements. He also has a modeling contract with Armani, which prevented him from appearing in a photo collection of Milan players that was published by Armani’s rival, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, in 2007.

Kaká featured on the cover of the Italian edition of EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game &quot;FIFA 07&quot;, alongside teammate and global star Ronaldinho; he also featured on the covers of regional editions of &quot;FIFA 11&quot;, &quot;FIFA 12&quot;, and &quot;FIFA 16&quot;. He was one of the Ultimate Team Icons in &quot;FIFA 20.&quot;
Kaká named Raí, the former Brazilian national team and São Paulo FC captain, as his footballing role model. He is best friends with former professional footballer Marcelo Saragosa, as they served as the best man at each others’ weddings. He is also close friends with Colombian striker Radamel Falcao.

In April 2012, Kaká became the first sportsperson to amass ten million followers on Twitter. In March 2015, Kaká had the fifth-highest social media following among athletes, with 33 million Facebook fans, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, David Beckham, and Neymar.
Kaká is an evangelical Christian and an active member of the São Paulo-based Rebirth in Christ Church. He became engrossed in religion at the age of 12: &quot;I learnt that it is faith that decides whether something will happen or not.&quot; He removed his jersey to reveal an &quot;I Belong to Jesus&quot; T-shirt and openly engaged in prayers after Brazil&#x27;s 2002 World Cup triumph, as well as Milan&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Scudetto&quot; and Milan’s 2007 Champions League triumphs. He also had the same phrase, along with &quot;God Is Faithful&quot;, stitched onto the tongues of his boots. During the celebration after Brazil&#x27;s 4–1 win over Argentina in the 2005 Confederations Cup final, he and several of his teammates wore T-shirts that read &quot;Jesus Loves You&quot; in various languages. While receiving the FIFA World Footballer of the Year award in 2007, he said that initially, he just wanted to be a professional player for São Paulo and play one game for the Brazil national team, but that &quot;God gave [him] more than he ever asked for.&quot; His goal celebration is him pointing to the sky as a tribute to God. Kaká&#x27;s favourite music genre is gospel and his favourite book is the Bible. In a 2006 interview with the Brazilian newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;, Kaká announced that he wanted to become an evangelical pastor.

Since November 2004, Kaká has served as an Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations&#x27; World Food Programme, and he was youngest to do so in 2004. In August 2015, Kaká announced he would attend Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida and major in Sports Marketing. On 5 January 2019, he announced his engagement to Brazilian model Carolina Dias on Instagram. Kaká was one of several Brazilian footballers to support Jair Bolsonaro in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election.

<text>A person who is said to have a stiff upper lip displays fortitude and stoicism in the face of adversity, or exercises great self-restraint in the expression of emotion. The phrase is most commonly heard as part of the idiom &quot;keep a stiff upper lip&quot;, and has traditionally been used to describe an attribute of British people in remaining resolute and unemotional when faced with adversity. A sign of fear is trembling of the upper lip, hence the saying keep a &quot;stiff&quot; upper lip.

==Examples==
The following have often been cited as exemplifying the &quot;stiff upper lip&quot;.
* During the Battle of Waterloo, the Earl of Uxbridge&#x27;s calm assessment of his injuries (he had lost his leg) to the Duke of Wellington after being hit by a cannonball.
* Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;If—&quot;, first published in 1910.
* During the sinking of HMS &quot;Birkenhead&quot; in 1852, soldiers famously stood in ranks on board, allowing the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking.
* In 1912, during the Terra Nova Expedition, Captain Lawrence Oates, aware that his own ill health was compromising his three companions&#x27; chances of survival, calmly leaving the tent and choosing certain death saying, &quot;I am just going outside and may be some time.&quot;
* In 1912, Captain Edward Smith directing the evacuation of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; before going down with the ship.
* Major Allison Digby Tatham-Warter, who would wear a bowler hat and carry an umbrella into battle in the Second World War, most famously at the battle for Arnhem Bridge.
* In 1982, Captain Moody aboard British Airways Flight 9 from London to Auckland, on realising that all engines of the aircraft had stopped because of volcanic ash, announced to the passengers, &quot;We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress.&quot; The pilots were eventually able to restart the engines, and safely divert the plane to Jakarta.
* In 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 suffered a catastrophic engine failure that rendered all hydraulics inoperable, resulting in the aircraft being virtually uncontrollable, with the exception of the engine throttles. Captain Al Haynes kept a healthy sense of self-deprecating humour throughout the ordeal, which could clearly be heard on the cockpit voice recorder. The crew, along with passengers who were off-duty pilots and flight engineers, managed to crash land the aircraft at Sioux Gateway Airport in Iowa. In simulation scenarios, no crew has ever been able to make it to the airport, and the event is often cited as one of the best examples of crew resource management in an emergency situation.

==Origins==
The idea of the stiff upper lip is traced back to Ancient Greece – to the Spartans, whose cult of discipline and self-sacrifice was a source of inspiration to the English public school system; and to the Stoics. Stoic ideas were adopted by the Romans, particularly the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who wrote, &quot;If you are distressed by any external thing, it is not this thing which disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.&quot; The concept reached England in the 1590s, and featured in the plays of William Shakespeare. His tragic hero Hamlet says, &quot;There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so&quot;. 

Poems that feature a memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism and a stiff upper lip include Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;If—&quot; and W. E. Henley&#x27;s &quot;Invictus&quot;. The phrase became symbolic of the British people, and particularly of those who were students of the English public school system during the Victorian era. Such schools were heavily influenced by stoicism, and aimed to instil a code of discipline and devotion to duty in their pupils through &#x27;character-building&#x27; competitive sports (as immortalised in the poem &quot;Vitai Lampada&quot;), corporal punishments and cold showers.

<doc id="1297137" wikidata="Q261839" url="?curid=1297137" title="Sheep shearing">
<text>Sheep shearing is the process by which the woollen fleece of a sheep is cut off. The person who removes the sheep&#x27;s wool is called a &quot;shearer&quot;. Typically each adult sheep is shorn once each year (depending upon dialect, a sheep may be said to have been &quot;shorn&quot;, &quot;sheared&quot; or &quot;shore&quot; [in Australia]). The annual shearing most often occurs in a shearing shed, a facility especially designed to process often hundreds and sometimes more than 3,000 sheep per day. A working group of shearers and accompanying wool workers is known as a &quot;shearing gang&quot;.

Sheep are shorn in all seasons including winter, depending on the climate, management requirements and the availability of a woolclasser and . Ewes are normally shorn prior to lambing in the warmer months, but consideration is typically made as to the welfare of the lambs by not shearing during cold climate winters. However, in high country regions, pre lamb shearing encourages ewes to seek shelter among the hillsides so that newborn lambs are not completely exposed to the elements. Shorn sheep tolerate frosts well, but young sheep especially will suffer in cold, wet windy weather (even in cold climate summers). In this event they are shedded for several nights until the weather clears. Some sheep may also be shorn with stud combs commonly known as cover combs which leave more wool on the animal in colder months, giving greater protection.

Sheep shearing is also considered a sport with competitions held around the world. It is often done between spring and summer.

==History==

===Pre-Industrial Europe===
Europe&#x27;s oldest city, Knossos, derived its wealth from the sheep wool industry. The largest group of Linear B tablets is the great archive principally of shearing records though also of sheep breeding.

The medieval English wool trade was one of the most important factors in the English economy. The main sheep-shearing was an annual midsummer (June) event in medieval England culminating in the sheep-shearing feast. It had always been conventional practice to wash sheep.

===Australia===
In Australia, until the 1870s, squatters washed their sheep in nearby creeks prior to shearing. Later some expensive hot water installations were constructed on some of the larger stations for the washing. Australian growers were influenced by the Spanish practice of washing their very fine wool after shearing. There were three main reasons for the custom in Australia:

# The English manufacturers demanded that Australian woolgrowers provide their fleeces free from excessive vegetable matter, burrs, soil, etc. so they could be processed in the same way as any other raw wool
# The dirty fleeces were hard to shear and demanded that the metal blade shears be sharpened more often.
# Wool in Australia was carted by bullock team or horse teams and charged by weight. Washed wool was lighter and did not cost as much to transport.

The practice of washing the wool rather than the sheep evolved from the fact that hotter water could be used to wash the wool, than that used to wash the sheep. When the practice of selling wool in the grease occurred in the 1890s, wool washing became obsolete.

Australia and New Zealand had to discard the old methods of wool harvesting and evolve more efficient systems to cope with the huge numbers of sheep involved. Shearing was revolutionized by the invention of an Australian sheepgrower, Frederick York Wolseley. His machines made in Birmingham, England, by his business The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company were introduced after 1888, reducing second cuts and shearing time. By 1915 most large sheep station sheds in Australia had installed machines, driven by steam or later by internal combustion engines.

Shearing tables were invented in the 1950s and have not proved popular, although some are still used for crutching.

In the US, the worldwide shortage of shearers is becoming a consideration for those wanting to expand wool production. With sheep numbers declining in that country the profession sees significantly less interest in becoming a qualified shearer. Importing labour during the Australian off-season has also become problematic because of delays in obtaining work visa and because shearers numbers are limited worldwide.

==Modern shearing in Australia==

Today large flocks of sheep are mustered, inspected and possibly treated for parasites such as lice before shearing can start. then shorn by professional shearing teams working eight-hour days, most often in spring, by machine shearing. These contract-teams consist of shearers, shed hands and a cook (in the more isolated areas). Their working hours and wages are regulated by industry awards. A working day starts at 7:30 am and the day is divided into four &quot;runs&quot; of two hours each. &quot;Smoko&quot; breaks are a half-hour each and a lunch break is taken at midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece-rate per sheep. Shearers who &quot;tally&quot; more than 200 sheep per day are known as &quot;gun shearers&quot;. Typical mass shearing of sheep today follows a well-defined workflow:

* remove the wool 
* throw the fleece onto the wool table 
* skirt, roll and class the fleece 
* place it in the appropriate wool bin 
* press and store the wool until it is transported

In 1984 Australia became the last country in the world to legalize the use of wide combs, due to previous Australian Workers&#x27; Union rules. Although they were once rare in sheds, women now take a large part in the shearing industry by working as pressers, wool rollers, rouseabouts, wool classers and shearers.

===Wool removal===
A sheep is caught by the shearer, from the catching pen, and taken to his &quot;stand&quot; on the shearing board. It is shorn using a mechanical handpiece (see &quot;Shearing devices&quot; below). The wool is removed by following an efficient set of movements, devised by Godfrey Bowen in about 1950 (the &quot;Bowen Technique&quot;) or the &quot;Tally-Hi&quot; method developed in 1963 and promoted by the Australian Wool Corporation. Sheep struggle less using the Tally-Hi method, reducing strain on the shearer and there is a saving of about 30 seconds in shearing each one.

The shearer begins by removing the belly wool, which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout, while the sheep is still being shorn. A professional or &quot;gun&quot; shearer typically removes a fleece, without significantly marking or cutting the sheep, in two to three minutes, depending on the size and condition of the sheep—less than two minutes in elite-competitive shearing. The shorn sheep is released and removed from the board via a chute in the floor or in a wall, to an exterior counting-out pen.

The CSIRO in Australia has developed a non-mechanical method of shearing sheep using an injected protein that creates a natural break in the wool fibres. After fitting a retaining net to enclose the wool, sheep are injected with the protein. When the net is removed after a week, the fleece has separated and is removed by hand. In some breeds a similar process occurs naturally.

===Fleece skirting===
Once the entire fleece has been removed from the sheep, the fleece is &quot;thrown&quot;, clean side down, on to a wool table by a shed hand (commonly known in New Zealand and Australian sheds as a &quot;rouseabout&quot; or &quot;rousie&quot;). The wool table top consists of slats spaced approximately 12 cm apart. This enables short pieces of wool, the &quot;locks&quot; and other debris, to gather beneath the table separately from the fleece. The fleece is then &quot;skirted&quot; by one or more wool rollers to remove the sweat fribs and other less desirable parts of the fleece. The removed pieces largely consist of shorter, seeded, burry or dusty wool etc. which is still useful in the industry. As such they are placed in separate containers and sold along with fleece wool. Other items removed from the fleece on the table, such as faeces, skin fragments or twigs and leaves, are discarded a short distance from the wool table so as not to contaminate the wool and fleece.

Following the skirting of the fleece, it is folded, rolled and examined for its quality in a process known as wool classing, which is performed by a registered and qualified wool classer. Based on its type, the fleece is placed into the relevant wool bin ready to be pressed (mechanically compressed) when there is sufficient wool to make a wool bale.

===Rooing===
In some primitive sheep (for example in many Shetlands), there is a natural break in the growth of the wool in spring. By late spring this causes the fleece to begin to peel away from the body, and it may then be plucked by hand without cutting – this is known as &quot;rooing&quot;. Individual sheep may reach this stage at slightly different times.

==Shearing devices==

Whatever device is used, shearers must be careful to keep it clean so as to prevent the spread of disease amongst a flock.

Blade shearing has recently made a resurgence in Australia and the UK but mostly for sport rather than commercial shearing. Some competitions have attracted almost 30 competitors and there have even been shows created just for blade shearers to compete in.

===Blade shears===
Blade shears consist of two blades arranged similarly to scissors except that the hinge is at the end farthest from the point (not in the middle). The cutting edges pass each other as the shearer squeezes them together and shear the wool close to the animal&#x27;s skin. Blade shears are still used today but in a more limited way. Blade shears leave some wool on a sheep and this is more suitable for cold climates such as the Canterbury high country in the South Island of New Zealand where approximately half a million sheep are still shorn with blade shears each year. For those areas where no powered-machinery is available blade shears are the only option. In Australia blades are more commonly used to shear stud rams.

===Machine shears===

Machine shears, known as handpieces, operate in a similar manner to human hair clippers in that a power-driven toothed blade, known as a cutter, is driven back and forth over the surface of a comb and the wool is cut from the animal. The original machine shears were powered by a fixed hand-crank linked to the handpiece by a shaft with only two universal joints, which afforded a very limited range of motion. Later models have more joints to allow easier positioning of the handpiece on the animal. Electric motors on each stand have generally replaced overhead gear for driving the handpieces. The jointed arm is replaced in many instances with a flexible shaft. Smaller motors allowed the production of shears in which the motor is in the handpiece; these are generally not used by professional shearers as the weight of the motor and the heat generated by it becomes bothersome with long use.

==Animal welfare==

Animal welfare organisations have raised concerns about the abuse of sheep during shearing, and have advocated against the selling and buying of wool products. Sheep shearers are paid by the number of sheep shorn, not by the hour, and there are no requirements for formal training or accreditation. Because of this it is alleged that speed is prioritised over precision and care of the animal.

In 2013, an anonymous shearer reported instances of animal abuse by workers, an allegation to which an Australian Worker&#x27;s Union representative added that he had witnessed &quot;shearers gouge eyes and break sheep jaws.&quot; Australian Wool Innovation insisted that animal welfare was a priority among shearers. The following year, the RSPCA began a cruelty investigation following the release of video footage that PETA said was taken in more than a dozen shearing sheds in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the video showed, &quot;sheep being roughly handled, punched in the face and stamped upon. One sheep was beaten with a hammer while another was shown having a deep cut crudely sewn up.&quot; The Shearing Contractors Association of Australia &quot;applauded&quot; the investigation, and Wool Producers Australia president Geoff Fisken said the behavior shown in the video was &quot;unacceptable and unsupportable&quot; but that &quot;we&#x27;re sure it doesn&#x27;t portray the 99.9% majority of wool shearers – and those shearers would be appalled by it as well&quot;. More recent footage and images of Australian workers abusing sheep have been released by anonymous sources, some of which was included in &quot;Dominion&quot;, a recent Australian documentary on animal farm abuses. No comment has been made about this by the Shearing Contractors Association of Australia.

==Shearing in culture==
A culture has evolved out of the practice of sheep shearing, especially in post-colonial Australia and New Zealand. The sheep-shearing feast is the setting for Act IV of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Thomas Tusser provides doggerel verse for the occasion:

&lt;poem&gt;Wife make us a dinner, spare flesh neither corne,
Make wafers and cakes, for our sheepe must be shorne,
At sheep shearing neighbors none other thing craue,
but good cheer and welcome, like neighbors to haue&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

===In Australia===


&quot;Click Go the Shears&quot; is a traditional Australian bush ballad dating from &quot;ante&quot; 1891, detailing the daily life of the members of a shearing gang.

&quot;Shearing the Rams&quot;, a painting by Australian painter Tom Roberts is like an icon for the livestock-growing culture or &quot;life on the land&quot; in Australia. It was parodied in Michael Leunig&#x27;s &quot;Ramming the Shears&quot;. The expression that Australia&#x27;s wealth rode on &quot;the sheep&#x27;s back&quot; in parts of the twentieth century no longer has the currency it once had.

In 2001, Mandy Francis of Hardy&#x27;s Bay, Australia, constructed a blackbutt seat for the Street Furniture Project at Walcha, NSW, Australia. This seat was inspired by the combs, cutters, wool tables and grating associated with the craft and industry of shearing.

During Australia&#x27;s long weekend in June 2010, 111 machine shearers and 78 blade shearers shore 6,000 Merino ewes and 178 rams at the historic 72 stand &quot;North Tuppal&quot; station. Along with the shearers there were 107 wool handlers and penners-up and more than 10,000 visitors to witness this event in the restored shed. Over this weekend the scene in Tom Robert&#x27;s &quot;Shearing of the Rams&quot; was re-enacted twice for the visitors.

Many stations across Australia no longer carry sheep due to lower wool prices, drought and other disasters, but their shearing sheds remain, in a wide variety of materials and styles, and have been the subject of books and documentation for heritage authorities. Some farmers are reluctant to remove either the equipment or the sheds, and many unused sheds remain intact.

===Contests===
Sheep shearing and wool handling competitions are held regularly in parts of the world, particularly Ireland, the UK, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. As sheep shearing is an arduous task, speed shearers, for all types of equipment and sheep, are usually very fit and well trained. In Wales a sheep shearing contest is one of the events of the Royal Welsh Show, the country&#x27;s premier agricultural show held near Builth Wells.

The world&#x27;s largest sheep shearing and wool handling contest, the Golden Shears, is held in the Wairarapa district, New Zealand.

The shearing World Championships are hosted by different countries every 2–3 years and eight countries have hosted the event. The first World Championships were held at the Bath &amp; West showground, England, in 1977, and the first Machine-Shearing winner was Roger Cox from New Zealand. Other countries that have hosted the sheep shearing World Championships have been New Zealand (3 times), England (3 times), Australia (2 times), Wales, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa &amp; Norway. Out of 13 World Championships, New Zealand have won the team Machine contest 10 times, and famous New Zealand sheep-shearer David Fagan has been World Champion a record 5 times.

In October, 2008 the event was hosted in Norway. It was the first time ever that the event was hosted by a non-English speaking country. The newly crowned World Machine Shearing champion is Paul Avery from New Zealand. New Zealand also won the team event, and the traditional blade-shears World Champion is Ziewilelle Hans from South Africa. A record 29 countries competed at the 2008 event. The next World Championship will be held in France in July 2019.

World Blade Shearing has been dominated by South African and Lesotho shearers, Fine Wool machine shearing dominated by Australian shearers, and New Zealand dominating the Strong Wool machine shearing.

<text>Panorama Point is the highest natural point in Nebraska, at an elevation of above sea level.
It is located in southwestern Kimball County, near the point where Nebraska and Wyoming meet on Colorado&#x27;s northern boundary. Despite its name and elevation, Panorama Point is not a mountain or a hill; it is merely a low rise on the High Plains. A stone marker, giving the elevation at , and a guest register are located at the summit of the drive. From the point one can see the nearby state corner marker, and a vast plains landscape with the Rocky Mountains in the western distance. Panorama Point is located on the High Point Bison Ranch, which permits visitors to drive to the site as long as they take care to avoid the ranging bison and pay an entrance fee.

<doc id="1297155" wikidata="Q313053" url="?curid=1297155" title="Alboka">
<text>The Basque  () is a single-reed woodwind instrument consisting of a single reed, two small diameter melody pipes with finger holes and a bell traditionally made from animal horn. Additionally, a reed cap of animal horn is placed around the reed to contain the breath and allow circular breathing for constant play. In the Basque language, an alboka player is called . The alboka is usually used to accompany a tambourine singer.

Although the alboka is native to the Basque region, similar instruments can be found around Spain including Madrid (), Asturias (), and Castile and Andalusia (), but in those cases they only have a single pipe. The name is derived from the Arabic (), which means &quot;the trumpet&quot; or &quot;the horn&quot;.

Hornpipes are made of a single reed, a small diameter melody pipe with fingerholes, and a bell traditionally made of animal horn. An animal horn reed cap usually encompasses the idioglot reed. These instruments are descended from single-reed idioglot instruments found in Egypt as early as 2700 BCE. During the Old Kingdom in Egypt (2778-2723 BCE), memets were depicted on the reliefs of seven tombs at Saqqarra, six tombs at Giza, and the pyramids of Queen Khentkaus. Horns were later added to the reed pipe to increase resonance. Horn caps were also added around the reed, and the player would blow into the hornpipe to activate the reed instead of holding it in their mouth.

The alboka has two cane pipes, a wood handle, and a horn at each end. It may be descended from the Moroccan double hornpipe, which has two cane pipes, each fitted with a cow horn. The alboka was established in Spain by the end of the 13th-century. Representations of it can be found in the and surviving medieval sculptural church decorations.

Notable players are Ibon Koteron and Alan Griffin. It is also being integrated into modern bands, such as .

==Varieties==

The Albogues include:

*The gaita gastore ( gaita del Gastor in Cádiz ) has a body made of pear or oleander wood decorated with a cross-shaped pattern, three finger holes on the top and one on the bottom, and a relatively long horn as a bell. It is played on saint&#x27;s days and at Christmas.

*The gaita serrana ( gaita de la sierra in Madrid ) has a wind cap made of cow horn, a sound tube made of wood (usually fig wood ) and square recesses in which the finger holes are located. The sound tube can have a round or square cross-section. The instrument has three to four finger holes on the top and a thumb hole. The bell is also made of cow horn. The gaita serrana was a pure shepherd&#x27;s instrument that served as a pastime. With the decline of the profession, it has practically died out.

*The best known instrument of this group is the Basque alboka with double sound tubes that have a common wind cap and a common horn bell. All parts of the instrument are attached to a semicircular wooden arch (see Alboka ).

*In Gascony , on the northwestern edge of the Pyrenees, the caramera ( caremère ) is played. It has a reed, a simple sound tube and an animal horn. The number of finger holes can be 6 + 1. [ 4 ]

*The chifla de Campoo (from the town of Campoo in Cantabria ) is not a hornpipe, but is related to the albogues. A sound pipe is made from a piece of wood about 25 cm long, with a small wooden funnel at the top and a large one at the bottom. The large funnel serves as a sound funnel, the upper one as a kind of wind cap. The reed is held loosely between the lips and blown inside this wind cap. The instrument has four to seven finger holes on the top.

<text>Future Soldier was a multi-nation military project launched by the United States and its allies in the late 1990s.

Superiority to enemy ground forces will be achieved by equipping the average ground-based combat soldier with an integrated set of high-technology uniforms and equipment. These will be linked to an array of real-time and archived battlefield information resources. Soldiers will require not only enhanced versions of existing equipment (rifle, pistol, knife, helmet, armour, clothing), but also new forms of equipment that will become possible as new types and combinations of technologies become viable for battlefield deployment.

==Exhibition==
Future Soldier Exhibition is an international exhibition mainly focused on the question of individual components of the &quot;Dismounted Soldier&quot; project, on the results of research, new technologies and materials, concepts and opportunities for international cooperation in the implementation of the integrated system of the soldier of the future and for the securing of the interoperability of its individual components in wartime and peacetime operations.

The last Future Soldier Exhibition took place in October 2012 in Prague. The event was organized under the aegis of the National Armaments Director within the Ministry of Defense of the Czech Republic.

<doc id="1297174" wikidata="Q260425" url="?curid=1297174" title="Lative case">
<text>In grammar, the lative ( ; abbreviated ) is a grammatical case which indicates motion to a location. It corresponds to the English prepositions &quot;to&quot; and &quot;into&quot;. The lative case belongs to the group of the general local cases together with the locative and separative case. The term derives from the Latin &quot;lat-&quot;, the fourth principal part of &quot;ferre&quot;, &quot;to bring, carry&quot;.

The lative case is typical of the Uralic languages and it was one of the Proto-Uralic cases. It still exists in many Uralic languages, such as Finnish, Erzya, Moksha, and Meadow Mari.

It is also found in the Dido languages, such as Tsez, Bezhta, and Khwarshi, as well as in the South Caucasian languages, such as Laz or Lazuri (&quot;see Laz grammar&quot;).

==Finnish==
In Finnish, the lative case is largely obsolete. It still occurs in various adverbs: &quot;alas, alemmas,&quot; &quot;down, further down&quot;, &quot;kauas,&quot; &quot;kauemmas&quot; &quot;(moving) far away, farther away&quot;, &quot;pois&quot; &quot;(going) away&quot;, and &quot;rannemmas&quot; &quot;towards and closer to the shore&quot; (derives from &#x27;ranta&#x27; [shore]). The lative suffix is usually &quot;-s&quot;.

In modern Finnish, it has been superseded by a more complicated system of locative cases and enclitics, and the original -s has merged with another lative or locative suffix and turned into the modern inessive, elative, illative and translative suffixes.

==Meadow Mari==
In Meadow Mari, the usage of the lative is restricted compared to that of the illative case. Whereas the illative can be used freely in connection with verbs indicating motion into/to/towards something, the lative occurs typically with only a smaller number of such verbs. Some examples of these are: кодаш &quot;kodaš&quot; &quot;to remain, to stay&quot;, шинчаш &quot;šinčaš&quot; &quot;to sit down&quot;, шочаш &quot;šočaš&quot; &quot;to be born&quot;, сакаш &quot;sakaš&quot; &quot;to hang up, to hang on&quot;, пышташ &quot;põštaš&quot; &quot;to put, to place&quot;, кушкаш &quot;kuškaš&quot; &quot;to grow (intransitive)&quot;. In many cases, both the illative and the lative cases can be used with a verb. Note that some of the verbs, such as шочаш or кушкаш, do not indicate motion towards a place.

The lative case in Meadow Mari can also fulfill a few auxiliary functions. It can indicate the cause for an action or under what circumstances the action takes place:
A noun in the lative can express a period of time in which something (repeatedly) takes place:
A noun in the lative can be used to indicate how someone or something is regarded, for what they are held:
A noun in the lative can express by what means something is transferred, relocated, or undergoes a change.


==Tsez==
In the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the lative also takes up the functions of the dative case in marking the recipient or beneficent of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb &quot;show&quot; (literally: &quot;make see&quot;) is given below:

The dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below; there is no such verb for &quot;to have&quot;:

The dative/lative case usually occurs, as in the examples above, in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; it should not be regarded as a separate case, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically. They are actually a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details.

Verbs of perception or emotion (like &quot;see&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;want&quot;) also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case, note that in this example the &quot;pure&quot; dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used.

<text>The doina () is a Romanian musical tune style, possibly with Middle Eastern roots, customary in Romanian peasant music, as well as in Lăutărească. It was also adopted into klezmer music.

Similar tunes are found throughout Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In some parts of the Balkans this kind of music is referred to as or .

==Origins and characteristics==
Béla Bartók discovered the &quot;doina&quot; in Northern Transylvania in 1912 and he believed it to be uniquely Romanian. After he found similar genres in Ukraine, Albania, Algeria, Middle East and Northern India, he came to the belief that these are part of a family of related genres of Arabo-Persian origin. He particularly linked the Romanian doina to the Turkish/Arabic &quot;Makam&quot; system. Bartók&#x27;s conclusions were rejected by some Romanian ethnomusicologists, who accused Bartók of anti-Romanian bias. Nevertheless, the similarities between the Romanian &quot;doina&quot; and various musical forms from the Middle East have been subsequently documented by both non-Romanian and Romanian scholars. Until the first half of the 20th century, both lăutari and klezmer musicians were recorded using a &quot;taksim&quot; as an introduction to a tune. The &quot;taksim&quot; would be later replaced by the &quot;doina&quot;, which has been described as being similar, though not totally identical to the &quot;taksim&quot;. Romanian ethnomusicologist and musician Grigore Leşe, after performing with a group of Iranian musicians, noticed that the &quot;doinas&quot; of Maramureş have &quot;great affinities&quot; with the Arabo-Persian music.

The &quot;doina&quot; is a free-rhythm, highly ornamented (usually melismatic), improvisational tune. The improvisation is done on a more or less fixed pattern (usually a descending one), by stretching the notes in a rubato-like manner, according to the performer&#x27;s mood and imagination. Usually the prolonged notes are the fourth or fifth above the floor note.

The peasant &quot;doinas&quot; are mostly vocal and monophonic and are sung with some vocal peculiarities that vary from place to place: interjections (&quot;măi&quot;, &quot;hei&quot;, &quot;dui-dui&quot;, &quot;iuhu&quot;), glottal clucking sounds, choked sobbing effects, etc. Instrumental &quot;doinas&quot; are played on simple instruments, usually various types of flutes, or even on rudimentary ones, such as a leaf. The peasant &quot;doina&quot; is a non-ceremonial type of song and is generally sung in solitude, having an important psychological action: to &quot;ease one&#x27;s soul&quot; (&quot;de stâmpărare&quot; in Romanian). Grigore Leşe believes that, while scholars describe in great detail the technical aspects of the &quot;doina&quot;, they fail to understand its psychological aspects. &quot;Doinas&quot; are lyrical in aspect and their common themes are melancholy, longing (&quot;dor&quot;), erotic feelings, love for nature, complaints about the bitterness of life or invocations to God to help ease pain, etc.

Unlike peasant &quot;doinas&quot;, lăutar and klezmer &quot;doinas&quot; are usually accompanied and played on more complex instruments (violin, pan-pipe, cymbalom, accordion, clarinet, tarogato, etc.). Also, unlike peasant &quot;doinas&quot;, lăutar and klezmer &quot;doinas&quot; are mostly played as an introduction to another tune, usually a dance.

In the regions of Southern Romania, Romani lăutari developed a type of doina called &quot;cântec de ascultare&quot; (meaning &quot;song for listening&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;de ascultare&quot; or simply &quot;ascultare&quot;). The &quot;cântec de ascultare&quot; spread to other regions of Romania, with local particularities.

Klezmer Doinas are influenced by Hassidic niguns.

==Types of doina==
*Hora lungă - Maramureş.
*Ca pe luncă - found along the Danube.
*Oltului - found along the Olt River.
*De codru - &quot;codru&quot; means &quot;forest&quot;.
*Haiduceşti (cântece haiduceşti, Cântece de haiducie) - &quot;haiduc&#x27;s songs&quot; &quot;haiduc&quot; means &quot;outlaw&quot; or &quot;brigand&quot;.
*Ca din tulnic - unique type in which the melody imitates a type of Alpenhorn called the tulnic.
*Ciobanului - shepherd&#x27;s doina.
*De dragoste - popular form, usually about love; &quot;dragoste&quot; means &quot;love&quot;.
*De jale - mellow, mournful doina; &quot;jale&quot; means &quot;grief&quot;.
*De leagăn - a lullaby; &quot;leagăn&quot; means &quot;cradle&quot;.
*De pahar - drinking song; &quot;pahar&quot; means &quot;drinking glass&quot;.
*Foaie verde - classical form; literally &quot;green leaf&quot;.
*Klezmer - played by Jewish musicians from Bessarabia and Moldavia.

==Current status==
While at the beginning of the 20th century, the &quot;doina&quot; was the most common type of peasant song (in some areas the only type), today it has almost completely disappeared from peasant life, as most peasant music has. This process has been accentuated during the communist era, with the rise of the new, so-called &quot;popular music&quot;, bringing a new style of performance that diluted the peasant styles.

The &quot;doina&quot; is still, however, common in the repertoire of the lăutari from Ardeal and Banat regions.

In 1976 the BBC religious television programme &quot;The Light of Experience&quot; took Gheorge Zamfir’s recording of &quot;Doina De Jale&quot; as its theme tune. Epic Records released the song as a single and made it to number four in the UK charts.

In 2009 the &quot;doina&quot; has been included in the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

<text>Turtle Mountain is a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created with the westward expansion of the province&#x27;s boundaries in 1881, eliminated by redistribution in 1968, and re-established in 1979, formally returned to the electoral map with the provincial election of 1981, was dissolved for the 2011 election and returned once again for the 2019 Manitoba general election.

Turtle Mountain is located in the southwestern region of the province. It is bounded to the north by Ste. Rose, to the west by Minnedosa and Arthur-Virden, to the east by Pembina, Carman and Portage la Prairie, and south to the American state of North Dakota.

The riding is primarily rural. Communities in the riding included Killarney, Carberry, Glenboro, Pilot Mound and MacGregor.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,569. In 1999, the average family income was $43,265, and the unemployment rate was 3.50%. Agriculture accounted for 37% of all industry in the riding, followed by health and social service work at 9%. Thirteen per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents were German.

Turtle Mountain has been represented by the Progressive Conservative Party for most of its history, and is considered safe for that party. It was in Tory hands for all but six years after 1922 in its first incarnation, and has been held by the Tories at all times in its third incarnation. The MLA prior to the 2019 Manitoba general election was Cliff Cullen, who was elected in a 2004 by-election.

Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was dissolved into the new ridings of Agassiz, Midland, and Spruce Woods. This change took effect for the 2011 election. Cullen transferred to Spruce Woods.

Following the 2018 redistribution, Turtle Mountain will be re-created out of Arthur-Virden, Spruce Woods and Midland and will first be contested in the 2019 Manitoba general election. The riding will contain the municipalities of Two Borders, Melita, Grassland, Brenda-Waskada, Deloraine-Winchester, Boissevain-Morton (previously in Arthur-Virden), Prairie Lakes, Killarney - Turtle Mountain, Argyle, Cartwright-Roblin (previously in Spruce Woods) and Lorne, Swan Lake 7, Louise and Pembina (previously in Midland). As of the 2016 Census, 8,294 (36%) people were in the Arthur-Virden portion of the riding, 7,215 (31%) were in the Spruce Woods portion and 7,653 (33%) were in the Midland portion, for a total population of 23,612.

The riding is named for Turtle Mountain Provincial Park.

<text>Huun-Huur-Tu ( ; ) are a music group from Tuva, a Russian federative republic situated on the Mongolia–Russia border. Their music includes throat singing, in which the singers sing both a note and its overtones, thus producing two or three notes simultaneously. The overtone may sound like a flute, whistle or bird, but is solely a product of the human voice.

The group primarily use native Tuvan instruments such as the &quot;igil&quot;, &quot;khomus&quot; (Tuvan jaw harp), &quot;doshpuluur&quot;, and &quot;dünggür&quot; (shaman drum). However, in recent years, the group have begun to selectively incorporate Western instruments, such as the guitar. While the thrust of Huun-Huur-Tu&#x27;s music is fundamentally indigenous Tuvan folk music, they also experiment with incorporating Western instruments and electronic music.

== History ==
The khöömei quartet Kunggurtug (, ) was founded in 1992 by Kaigal-ool Khovalyg, brothers Alexander and Sayan Bapa, and Albert Kuvezin. Not long afterwards, the group changed its name to Huun-Huur-Tu, meaning &quot;sunbeams&quot; (literally &quot;sun propeller&quot;). The focus of their music was traditional Tuvan folk songs, frequently featuring imagery of the Tuvan steppe or of horses.

The ensemble released its first album, &quot;60 Horses In My Herd&quot;, the following year. The album was recorded at studios in London and Mill Valley, California. By the time recording began for the follow-up, Kuvezin had left the group to form the more rock-oriented Yat-Kha. Kuvezin was replaced by Anatoli Kuular, who had previously worked with Khovalyg and Kongar-ool Ondar as part of the Tuva Ensemble. The new line-up recorded &quot;The Orphan&#x27;s Lament&quot; in New York City and Moscow, and released it in 1994.

In 1995, Alexander Bapa, who had produced the first two albums, departed the group to pursue production as a full-time career. He was replaced by Alexei Saryglar, formerly a member of the Russian state ensemble Siberian Souvenir. A third album, &quot;If I&#x27;d Been Born An Eagle&quot;, recorded in the Netherlands, followed in 1997. In early 1999, the group released its fourth album, &quot;Where Young Grass Grows&quot;. 

Huun-Huur-Tu participated in the 2000 BBC Music Live event. The following year, the group released their first live album.

In 2003, Kuular quit the group and was replaced by Andrey Mongush, an experienced teacher of khöömei and Tuvan instruments. Mongush&#x27;s tenure with the group was short and in 2005 he was replaced by Radik Tülüsh, formerly of Yat-Kha fame.

Huun-Huur-Tu signed with Beijing management company Stallion Era in March 2015.

==Band members==
==Collaboration==
Since the group&#x27;s inception, Huun Huur Tu has collaborated with musicians from many genres, such as Frank Zappa, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson, the Kodo drummers, The Moscow Art Trio, the Kronos Quartet, The Chieftains and Bulgarian women&#x27;s singing group, Angelite. Their recording &quot;Eternal&quot; is a collaborative effort with underground electronic musician, Carmen Rizzo. Huun Huur Tu appeared on three songs on &quot;Bahamut&quot;, the debut of New York-based blues group Hazmat Modine. In January 2010, Hazmat Modine also announced plans to record with Huun Huur Tu again.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Huun-Huur-Tu&quot;″s Radik Tülüsh song &quot;Oskus Urug&quot; was featured in the American television series &quot;Fargo&quot;&#x27;s third-season episode &quot;The Law of Vacant Places&quot; and &quot;Prayer&quot; from the 1994 album &quot;The Orphan&#x27;s Lament&quot; was featured in fifth-season episode &quot;The Paradox of Intermediate Transactions&quot;. In 2001, several of Huun-Hur-Tu&#x27;s songs were featured on the soundtrack of &quot;&quot;, a 2001 Cannes Winner.

<doc id="1297190" wikidata="Q7528682" url="?curid=1297190" title="Sir Richard Willis, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Richard Willis, 1st Baronet (sometimes spelt &#x27;Willys&#x27;) (13 January 1614 – December 1690) was a Royalist officer during the English Civil War, and a double agent working for the Parliamentarians during the Interregnum.

==Early life==
Willis was the younger brother of Thomas Willys, both being sons of Richard Willys, a lawyer and Lord of the Manors of Fen Ditton and Horningsey, Cambridgeshire, by Jane, daughter and heir of William Henmarsh, of Balls, in Ware, Hertfordshire. Both were created baronets of Fen Ditton in Cambridgeshire by Charles I.

==Career==
Willis went up to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1631, and was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn in the same year. As a younger son, he stood to inherit little, so became a career soldier, enlisting in the Dutch military and serving at the Siege of Breda in 1637, returning to serve under King Charles I in the Bishops&#x27; Wars from 1639 to 1640. Prior to the outbreak of civil war, Willis was a member of the King&#x27;s Guard based at Whitehall under Sir Thomas Lunsford.

He joined the Royalist cause as an officer in the King&#x27;s army, being knighted on 1 October 1642 by the King for gallantry in a cavalry skirmish at Shrewsbury, and was promoted to Colonel of a Regiment of Cavalry under William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison, being captured twice during this period but escaping. Imprisoned in the Tower of London for nine months following capture at Ellesmere in 1644, Willis joined Prince Rupert&#x27;s forces.

Willis eventually became Colonel General of the counties of Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Rutland, and in May 1645 was appointed Governor of Newark. By this time Prince Rupert had been defeated at the Battle of Naseby, and through the machinations of Lord Digby, a rival and advisor to the King, came under suspicion as plotting against the crown. Rupert&#x27;s subsequent surrender at Bristol caused Charles to dismiss his nephew from his service. While Charles was at Newark, Rupert arrived to confront him over what he considered the injury done to his honour; Willis rode out with Lord Gerard to greet him. The court-martial Rupert demanded exonerated him, but Willis, for what the King considered to be the disloyalty of his attendance on Rupert, was replaced by Lord Belasyse as Governor of Newark. Willis challenged him to a duel, but was stopped by the King; Rupert, his brother Prince Maurice, Gerard and other cavaliers took Willis&#x27;s side and in the ensuing argument were all dismissed from the King&#x27;s service.
Rupert later reconciled with the King, and Willis, for his previous service, was created a Baronet of Fen Ditton in June 1646, as his elder brother, a landowner and politician, had been five years previously.

Following the Royalist defeat, Willis spent some time in Italy, returning to England in 1652 to join the Royalist underground organisation, the Sealed Knot (his successor as Governor of Newark, Belasyse, was also one of the members).

However, it seems Willis became a double agent. Although twice imprisoned by the Commonwealth, he established contact with Cromwell&#x27;s secret service, led by John Thurloe, in 1656 or 1657, possibly for money (in &quot;A Child&#x27;s History of England&quot;, Ch.XXXIV, Charles Dickens wrote that Willis &quot;reported to Oliver everything that passed among them, and had two hundred a year for it&quot;). Alternatively, Willis may have wanted to secure his safety in case the Royalist cause failed. Notwithstanding critical assessments of his actions, however, no evidence has been uncovered that Willis passed on any significant piece of information, or betrayed any old friends.

In 1659 Willis was denounced to the future King Charles II by Thurloe&#x27;s secretary, Samuel Morland, who accused him of plotting, with Thurloe and Cromwell, to lure Charles and his brothers to return to England under false pretences (to meet followers in Sussex) and then assassinate them. Morland is said to have learned of the plan while pretending to be asleep in Thurloe&#x27;s office in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

After the Restoration Willis was banned from court, but no other punishment was imposed, presumably in recognition of his previous service. Having taken a wife of considerable means, he enjoyed a comfortable retirement with his family at Fen Ditton, where his will, dated 16 to 20 May, was probated 10 December 1690.

==Personal life==
Willis married in or before 1659, Alice, daughter and sole heir of Thomas Fox, M.D., of Warlies, in Waltham Holy Cross, Essex [bur. there 26 Nov. 1662], and of Shipton, Oxon, by Anne, daughter of Robert Honywood, of Pett, in Charing, Kent. Her will, dated 27 October 1684, probated 28 March 1688. Alice was the great-granddaughter of the martyrologist John Foxe, her grandfather being his son Samuel (1560-1630).

The baronetcy passed to Sir Thomas Fox Willys, of Warlies (30 June 1661 – 1701) who was said by his grandfather Thomas Fox to have been born &quot;bereft of his wits&quot; and died unmarried and without children at the age of 59. With his death the Baronetcy created for Willis became extinct.

==In literature==
Richard Willis appears as a character in Act II of the play Cromwell by Victor Hugo, published in Paris in 1828.

In his afterword to &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot;, Iain Pears explains that much of the book&#x27;s plot was inspired by the career of Willis, and his family&#x27;s later, unsuccessful attempts to clear his name.

<text>Jan de Hartog (April 22, 1914 – September 22, 2002) was a Dutch playwright, novelist and occasional social critic who moved to the United States in the early 1960s and became a Quaker.

== Early life ==
In 1914, Jan de Hartog was born to a Dutch Calvinist minister and professor of theology, Arnold Hendrik, and his wife, Lucretia de Hartog, who was a lecturer in medieval mysticism. He was raised in Haarlem in the Netherlands.

When he was 10 year old, de Hartog ran away to become a cabin boy on board a Dutch fishing boat. Despite his father having returned de Hartog home, when he was 12 years old, de Hartog ran away to a steamer in the Baltic.

At 16, he attended the Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart in Amsterdam, a training college for the Dutch merchant marine.

De Hartog shoveled coal at night with the Amsterdam Harbour Police until 1932.

While employed as skipper of a tour boat on the Amsterdam Canals, he wrote mysteries featuring Inspector Gregor Boyarski of the Amsterdam Harbor Police. He used the pseudonym &quot;F. R. Eckmar.&quot;

His theater career began in the 1930s at the Amsterdam Municipal Theater, where he acted in and wrote a play.

== World War II ==
In May 1940, 10 days before Nazi Germany invaded and occupied the Netherlands, de Hartog published his book &quot;Hollands Glorie&quot; (&quot;Holland&#x27;s Glory&quot;, translated into English as &quot;Captain Jan&quot;).

The novel described the life of sailors on ocean-going tugboats rescuing ocean liners. The book became a bestseller in the Netherlands. De Hartog joined the Dutch resistance, and was pursued by the Nazis, forcing him to go into hiding in Amsterdam in 1943. He escaped to England. His book became the best selling novel of the war years in the Netherlands.

He joined the Netherlands merchant navy as a correspondent in 1943 and served as a ship&#x27;s captain for which he received the Netherlands&#x27; &quot;Cross of Merit.&quot;

De Hartog&#x27;s experience served as the background for books such as &quot;The Captain&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Stella&quot; was made into a movie called &quot;The Key&quot;, starring Sophia Loren, Trevor Howard, and William Holden.

== Postwar ==
In 1947, De Hartog&#x27;s book &quot;Hollands Glorie&quot; was translated into English and was called &quot;Captain Jan&quot;. Remaining in the United Kingdom, de Hartog began writing his books in English, beginning with &quot;The Lost Sea&quot; (1951), which was a fictional account of his experiences working aboard ship.

In 1952, while visiting New York, he encountered a play that he had written while he had still been in hiding during the war and had sold the rights to while he was in England. The play was called &quot;The Fourposter&quot;, for which de Hartog received a Tony Award for Best Play at the 6th annual Tony Awards Show. Columbia Pictures made &quot;The Fourposter&quot; into a partially animated movie, starring Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for its cinematography. In 1966, &quot;The Fourposter&quot; became the musical &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; The play appeared under its original name at the Theatre New Brunswick in 1974.

De Hartog and his wife transformed a 90-foot Dutch ship into a houseboat, which they made their home. During the floods in the Netherlands of 1953, &quot;The Rival&quot; was transformed into a floating hospital about which de Hartog wrote in &quot;The Little Ark&quot;.

== Move to America ==
In the 1950s, de Hartog took &quot;The Rival&quot; to Houston, Texas on the deck of a freighter.

While de Hartog was lecturing at the University of Houston on playwriting, he and his wife volunteered at Jefferson Davis County Hospital.

De Hartog wrote about the bad conditions at the hospital in his non-fiction memoir &quot;The Hospital&quot; (1964). The book received a national response but also a local response in which, within a week of the book&#x27;s release, nearly four hundred citizens volunteered at the hospital. It led to reforms of the city&#x27;s indigent healthcare system through the creation of the Harris County Hospital District. Despite national success, some of Houston&#x27;s citizens reacted to the book with hostility, forcing de Hartog and his wife to return to Europe.

In 1967, de Hartog wrote &quot;The Captain&quot;, which revisited his love of the sea and featured a central character based loosely on himself called Martinus Harinxma, who had first appeared in &quot;The Lost Sea&quot; (1951). The book was a success, and Martinus would live on as a central character in several sequels.

Before starting work on the second in the Martinus series, de Hartog wrote of the experience of adopting his two daughters, who were Korean War orphans, in &quot;The Children&quot;, which appeared in 1969. He wrote a fictionalized account of the origin of the Religious Society of Friends, &quot;The Peaceable Kingdom: An American Saga&quot;, in 1972. It was nominated for the Nobel Prize and was followed eight years later by a Quaker novel, &quot;The Lamb&#x27;s War&quot; (1980).

In 1985, de Hartog was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.

He published the next book in the Martinus series, &quot;The Commodore&quot;, in 1986 while he was living in The Walled Garden in East Coker, Somerset, England, and it was followed by &quot;The Centurion&quot; (1989), which explored an interest in which he and his wife had become involved, dowsing.

In 1993, de Hartog and his wife returned to Houston. He returned to the Quaker theme to write the last in the series, &quot;The Peculiar People&quot;, in 1992.

De Hartog&#x27;s last fully completed novel was &quot;The Outer Buoy: A Story of the Ultimate Voyage&quot; in 1994.

In 1996, de Hartog was honored as the annual &quot;Special Guest&quot; at the Netherlands Film Festival.

In 2002, de Hartog died at the age of 88. His ashes were taken to sea on a tugboat, the , and were scattered on the surface of the sea at position 52.02.5 N – 04.05.0 E at 13.10 hrs LT by his wife, Marjorie, and his son, Nick, while other family members spread flowers at the site.

In 2007, Marjorie de Hartog edited a short story that her husband had begun, &quot;A View of the Ocean.&quot;

<text>Elena Souliotis (spelled Suliotis in the early part of her career; ; 28 May 19434 December 2004) was a Greek operatic soprano.

==Biography==
Elena Souliotis was born in Athens, Greece, of Greek and Russian parents but moved with her family to Argentina at an early age. She studied with Mercedes Llopart, who also taught Renata Scotto, Anna Moffo, Fiorenza Cossotto, Ivo Vinco and Alfredo Kraus Trujillo. She made her debut in 1964 as Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; in Naples. She made her United States debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago during the 1965-66 season as Elena in Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot;; her colleagues in that performance were Renata Tebaldi, Alfredo Kraus and Nicolai Ghiaurov. Other roles that she went on to sing soon afterwards were Luisa Miller, Amelia in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; and the title role of &quot;La Gioconda&quot;. A partial list of other operas in which she sang during the first part of her career (1964–1974) include Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, Catalani&#x27;s &quot;Loreley&quot;, Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La straniera&quot;, Zandonai&#x27;s &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;, and Susanna in Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;. She gave a recital at Carnegie Hall in 1976 and disappeared from the scene shortly after that.

The role for which she is best known is Abigaille in Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Nabucco&quot;. She made a recording of this role for Decca/London in 1965 (opposite Tito Gobbi, and conducted by Lamberto Gardelli), and gave a performance of the role on opening night of La Scala&#x27;s 1966-67 season. Within the next couple of years, she also recorded Santuzza (with Mario del Monaco and Gobbi, 1966) and the title role in &quot;Norma&quot; (with del Monaco, 1967), the latter in an abridged recording that was much maligned when it was initially released.

In 1968-69, she recorded Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; (with Marilyn Horne), a role she had sung at Carnegie Hall to open its 1967-68 season (with Plácido Domingo, Horne, and Dame Janet Baker), and, in 1970, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; (opposite Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Luciano Pavarotti, conducted by Gardelli). In 1970, she had changed the spelling of her name from Suliotis to Souliotis. She also recorded arias from &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, &quot;Luisa Miller&quot;, &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (the last two before she had recorded the complete operas).

She made her London debut on 3 November 1968, when she sang Abigaille in a concert performance of &quot;Nabucco&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, an event mounted by the London Opera Society. The cast also included Piero Cappuccilli and Boris Christoff, and the conductor was Mario Gusella. In June 1969, she made her debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, singing Lady Macbeth for the first time.

Souliotis was scheduled to make her Metropolitan Opera debut as Lady Macbeth during the 1969-70 season. However, due to a strike, the first few months of the season were canceled. Souliotis never sang at the Met.

The received opinion is that Souliotis&#x27;s early assumption of difficult roles damaged her voice. After an absence from the stage that lasted several years, she began a second career in secondary roles, beginning in 1979. She sang Fata Morgana in Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; in Chicago and Florence, and went on to sing in such operas as Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Gambler&quot; and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Suor Angelica&quot;, in the latter as the Zia Principessa. Her recording of this latter role, in 1991, opposite Mirella Freni, was her final studio recording. Toward the end of her career, she sang the role of the Comtesse in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; in several venues, and gave her farewell to the operatic stage in this role in Stuttgart in February 2000.

Elena Souliotis died of heart failure in 2004 in Florence, Italy, aged 61.
