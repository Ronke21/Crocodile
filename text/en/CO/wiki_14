<text>Madurese (&quot;&quot;; ; ) is a Austronesian ethnic groups native to the Indonesian island of Madura in Java Sea, off the northeastern coast of Java. They speak their own native Madurese (with diverse varieties), sharing a common history, traditions, and cultural identity. Nationwide, the Madurese are the third-largest ethnic group in Indonesia, and one of the well-known Indonesian national dishes, Satay, is attributed to the Madurese as part of their culinary heritage.

There are about six million native Madurese living on their ancestral land, Madura Island, and around half a million residing in eastern Java, mainly in the regencies of Jember, Banyuwangi, and others. The Madurese population in Java forms a subgroup called the Pandalungan Madurese, who speak a blend of Javanese and Madurese.

The Madurese are not only known as the inventors of satay but also as the creators of the Karapan sapi bull race. The group have historically been pioneers of classical Islamic religious movements in Indonesia, with the Pondok Pesantren serving as a vital center for Madurese Muslims to study Islam, particularly Indonesian Islam. In addition to being merchants, the Madurese diaspora is traditionally known for farming and practicing the Pencak silat martial art. The Madurese men often work with their cultural Clurit sickles, wearing distinctive cultural clothing characterized by red and white stripes derived from the Majapahit naval flag (a historical eastern Javanese empire that once controlled Madura Island). Other colors like black, red, yellow, white, green, and blue are also considered cultural symbols, as seen in their traditional Madurese-style batik.

== Population and distribution ==
Official and academic data on the population of Madurese people vary considerably. During the nationwide population census conducted in Indonesia in 2010, the Madurese people make up 3.03% of the country&#x27;s population, that is 7,179,356 people. On the other hand, some scientific sources operate with significantly larger figures around 10.5 to 10.8 million people. In any case, the Madurese people are among the largest ethnics of Indonesia, thus, according to the statistics of the 2010 census, they occupy the fourth largest ethnic group after the Javanese people, Sundanese people and Batak people.

Historically, the Madurese people inhabit Madura Island and located to the east of it, a group of smaller islands in Java Sea such as Kambing Island, Sapudi Islands and Kangean Islands. Here they number about 3.3 million people, which is more than 90% of the population in these territories. Approximately the same number of Madurese people living in the eastern end of the Java Island, and more than 400,000 people in various parts of the Indonesian part of the island of Kalimantan. In addition, tens of thousands of the Madurese people live in other regions of Indonesia; especially, there are significant Madurese communities in the capital city of Jakarta (about 80,000 people), in Bali (about 30,000 people) and in the province of Bangka Belitung Islands (more than 15,000 people). There are also small Madurese communities in the countries of Southeast Asia adjacent to Indonesia, particularly, in Singapore.

== Language ==

The Madurese people speak the Madurese language, which belongs to the Austronesian family, more specifically the Malayo-Sumbawan group. It is divided into several dialects. Linguistically, there are different points of view regarding the dialects of the Madurese language. Older works would normally identify two or four dialects, but modern specialists have concluded that there are six dialects. The most developed dialect in the lexical terms is the Sumenep dialect, which underlies the literary Madurese language. The most common dialect is Bangkalan, which often functions as a lingua franca between Madurese people from different localities.

In some parts of East Java among a significant number of Madurese population, a peculiar mixed of Madurese-Javanese dialect has formed. In addition to these native languages, many are also fluent in Indonesian, the national language.

== Religion ==
The majority of Madurese practice Sunni Islam. Characteristically, unlike a significant part of their fellow religious Indonesians, Madurese people enjoy a reputation as very zealous adherents of Islam. Muslim theologians play an important role in their spiritual and social life. A significant part of the Madurese people is trained in traditional Pesantren Muslim schools, which play an important role in their spiritual and social life.

== Socio-economic structure ==
=== Basic livelihood ===

Family is important to the Madurese and they commonly live in villages that function around an Islamic religious center. According to Islamic law, a man may have more than one wife. Marriage proposals are usually made by the groom&#x27;s parents, preferably to a first or second cousin. If the proposal is accepted, the bride&#x27;s parents are then presented with the &quot;bride price&quot;, which is usually cattle. The groom&#x27;s parents then set the date for the upcoming wedding. Newlywed couples often live with the bride&#x27;s family. Islam is an integral part of the social, political and economic life of the Madurese.

The main traditional occupations of the Madurese are animal farming, which mainly includes breeding of cattle, goats, horses, poultry and fighting cocks. The Madurese are known for herding cattle, hence they are often referred by a common nickname as the &quot;cowboys&quot; of Indonesia. Cattle are an important part of the culture, and bull-racing is one of their favorite sports.

Agriculture among the Madurese people on the island of Madura is poorly developed due to low fertility and very poor soil conditions, thus farming is not important in Madurese culture. As a result, the Madurese tend not to farm, unless on other islands with very good soil conditions, such as the Madurese people in Java, where agriculture is practiced more widely and have developed to a lesser degree. The main crops are such as corn, cassava, rice, tobacco, beans and cloves. Among craftsmen, tanning, pottery, batik manufacturing, blacksmithing, as well as small vassals and boat builders are also important occupations. In coastal areas, the Madurese are actively engaged in fishing, trading and as well as extraction of salt (from Madura Island). Lastly, the Madurese people also enjoyed a reputation in the region as skilled seafarers. Madurese residents of large cities, particularly in eastern Surabaya are actively involved in modern economic sectors.

=== Settlements ===
Traditional Madurese settlements are scattered and rarely linear in layout, depending rather on the direction of the roads. In most villages, there are paddocks for cattle rearing. Houses are made of bamboo and often built on low stilts. They have a frame structure usually supplemented with a veranda. Roofs are covered with palm leaves or reeds, however from the last third of the 20th century, the usage of roof tiles is increasingly common.

=== Transmigration ===
Low yields on soils had long served the cause of mass migrant labor and the relocation of the local population outside the island, where the Madurese were major clients of the government&#x27;s large-scale transmigration programmes undertaken by both the Dutch colonial administration as well as the authorities of independent Indonesia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, through which they settled in relatively sparsely populated areas of Indonesia&#x27;s other islands, especially Kalimantan. As a result of this program, more than half of the ethnic Madurese people currently living outside of their customary homeland had settled in many regions of Indonesia, where communities of former transmigrants and their descendants that still maintain their Madurese identity.

Madurese people have lived on the territory of Java for several centuries, forming the ethnic majority in some of the north-eastern regions of the island. They tend to get along well with the Javanese people in relation to language, culture, and way of life. Mixed marriages between Javanese and Madurese people are also common. Moreover, in some areas of eastern Java, there are significant communities of descendants of such &quot;pendalungan&quot; marriages, which are distinguished by their unique cultural traditions that combine Madurese and Javanese elements to varying degrees.

Another situation often develops in the provinces of West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, where Madurese people resettled under the transmigration programmes in 1900 to 1950 in the span of 90 years. Some of these migrant groups have been the subject of conflict with Dayak communities. The native population, especially the Dayaks were quite wary of strangers, and seeing them as a threat to their traditional livelihoods. Mutual distrust also promote ethnic and cultural and religious differences, where most Dayak people practices Christianity or Kaharingan. The most publicized conflict has been on various localities in Kalimantan, where thousands were killed in a series of large scale armed fighting between the Madurese and the Dayak people during the late 1990s.

In West Kalimantan there was communal violence between Dayaks and Madurese in 1996, in the Sambas conflict in 1999 and the Sampit conflict 2001, resulting in large scale massacres of Madurese. In the Sambas conflict, both Malays and Dayaks people massacred the Madurese people. Tens of thousands of Madurese people from Kalimantan were forced to move to Madura and Java. By the mid-2000s, the situation has somewhat stabilized and enabled the return of most of the Madurese resettlement back in Kalimantan.

== Culture ==
===Cuisine===
For the Madurese people, their traditional cuisine is characterized by a fairly large use of meat; of which primarily prepare miniature skewers called &quot;satay&quot; accompanied with special sweet marinade and thick sharp sauce made from peanut, has enjoyed a wide popularity in many parts of Indonesia. In addition, traditional Madurese culinary are characterized by the active use of corn and, in general, greater salinity and spiciness of dishes compared to other regional cuisines of the country.

=== Folk art and traditional attire ===
Culturally the Madurese people are close enough to eastern Javanese that they share similar forms of folklore, music (including gamelan), dance, and shadow theater or wayang. The traditional attire, however, is very specific to the Madurese people. Men would wear a completely black long-skirted coat with a wide belt, which most often hooks under a shirt that comes in broad red and white stripes, along with a checkered sarong. While women would have donned a dark blue or mottled jacket over a sarong.

=== Bull racing ===

A truly unique tradition of the islanders is bull racing, known as Karapan sapi, where local bred bulls harnessed in special light carts are led by a charioteer, usually a young man or teenager. Such competitions are typical of Madura, where they serve as its main tourist attraction. Races are held annually in August and October in different localities, after which their winners compete in the final round, which is traditionally held in Pamekasan. Races are usually accompanied by gamelan performances and folk festivities.

By the end of the 1980s, the popularity of Madurese bull racing had grown so much that the winner of the competition would be awarded with a prize on behalf of the president of Indonesia. In addition, the scene of the races was depicted on the reverse of coins of 100 Indonesian rupiah, produced from 1991 to 1998.

=== Brawling ===
Traditionally in terms of socio-economic life of the Madurese people, there had been a visible impact on their national character. They are often characterized as hard workers, stubborn, courageous, possessing integrity, loyal, generous, fair; and, at the same time, sharpness, resentment, extreme frugality, isolation, arrogant, hot-tempered, prone to violence and distrust towards strangers - especially against the backdrop of kindness and sociability of their neighbors such as the Javanese people.

In rural areas, the Madurese still practice an ancient tradition of vendetta, called &quot;&quot; (also spelled &quot;charok&quot;) which literally means &quot;battle of honor&quot;. In the 1990s, law enforcement agencies in each of the four districts in Madura have recorded dozens of cases each year. The killing may provoke resentment, quite small by the standards of ordinary European or Indonesian. According to local criminal statistics, most of the reason for such attacks are usually molestation of women or property dispute, but it often happens that the Madurese&#x27;s cruel revenge is motivated by an insufficiently polite treatment or insult in public places to one&#x27;s honor.

Instrument of revenge used in this dueling is often the traditional Madurese crescent knife, celurit which is the most common peasant weapon and in some areas and also the attribute of traditional male attire. In such cases, the avenger usually prepares the celurit in advance in an event of dueling by casting special spells on the weapon.

Sometimes in the &quot;battle of honor&quot; are involved several people from each side - relatives and friends of the offender and the offended, and then it turns into a bloodbath. Such massive bloodshed have repeatedly occurred in Madura even in the 21st century. The most famous incident in recent years, a mass &quot;carok&quot; occurred on 13 July 2006 in Bujur Tengah village, Pamekasan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, resulting stabbing and killing of seven men and seriously injuring nine people.

<text>Myspace (formerly stylized as MySpace; also myspace; and sometimes my␣, with an elongated open box symbol) is a social networking service based in the United States. Launched on August 1, 2003, it was the first social network to reach a global audience and had a significant influence on technology, pop culture and music. It also played a critical role in the early growth of companies like YouTube and created a developer platform that launched companies such as Zynga, RockYou, and Photobucket, among others, to success. From 2005 to 2009, Myspace was the largest social networking site in the world.

In July 2005, Myspace was acquired by News Corporation for $580 million; in June 2006, it surpassed Yahoo and Google to become the most visited website in the United States. During the 2008 fiscal year, it generated $800 million in revenue. At its peak in April 2008, Myspace had 115 million monthly visitors; by that time, the recently emergent Facebook had about the same number of visitors, but somewhat more global users than MySpace. In May 2009, Facebook surpassed Myspace in its number of unique U.S. visitors. Since then, the number of Myspace users has declined steadily despite several redesigns. As of 2019, Myspace had seven million monthly visitors.

In June 2009, Myspace employed approximately 1,600 people. In June 2010, Specific Media Group and Justin Timberlake jointly purchased the company for approximately $35 million. On February 11, 2016, it was announced that Myspace and its parent company had been purchased by Time Inc. for $87 million. On January 31, 2018, Time Inc. was in turn purchased by Meredith Corporation, and later that year, on November 4, 2019, Meredith spun off Myspace and its original holding company (Viant Technology Holding Inc.) and sold it to Viant Technology LLC.

==History==
===2003–2005: Beginnings and rise===
In August 2003, several eUniverse employees with Friendster accounts saw potential in its social networking features. The group decided to mimic the more popular features of the website. Within 10 days, the first version of MySpace was ready for launch, implemented using ColdFusion. A complete infrastructure of finance, human resources, technical expertise, bandwidth, and server capacity was available for the site. The project was overseen by Brad Greenspan (eUniverse&#x27;s founder, chairman and CEO), who managed Chris DeWolfe (MySpace&#x27;s starting CEO), Josh Berman, Tom Anderson (MySpace&#x27;s starting president), and a team of programmers and resources provided by eUniverse. It was during this early period in June 2003, just prior to the birth of MySpace, that Jeffrey Edell was brought on as chairman of parent company Intermix Media.

The first MySpace users were eUniverse employees. The company held contests to see who could sign up the most users. eUniverse used its 20 million users and e-mail subscribers to breathe life into MySpace and move it to the head of the pack of social networking websites. A key architect was tech expert Toan Nguyen, who helped stabilize the platform when Greenspan asked him to join the team. Co-founder and CTO Aber Whitcomb played an integral role in software architecture, utilizing the then-superior development speed of ColdFusion over other dynamic database driven server-side languages of the time. Despite having over ten times the number of developers, Friendster, which was developed in JavaServer Pages (jsp), could not keep up with the speed of development of MySpace and cfm. For example, users could customize the background, look and feel of pages on MySpace.

MySpace originally gained users because of how easy it made to communicate with other users. Before MySpace debuted, many people communicated online through Instant Messaging or IM. However, MySpace got so popular that people started to use MySpace to message people even more than IM. This was especially true in bigger cities that had more people compared to suburbs that still used IM more.

The MySpace.com domain was originally owned by YourZ.com, Inc., intended until 2002 for use as an online data storage and sharing site. By late 2003, it was transitioned from a file storage service to a social networking site. A friend who also worked in the data storage business reminded DeWolfe that he had earlier bought the MySpace.com domain. DeWolfe suggested they charge a fee for the basic MySpace service. However, Greenspan nixed the idea, believing that keeping the site free was necessary to make it a successful community. MySpace quickly gained popularity among teenagers and young adults. In February 2005, DeWolfe held talks with Mark Zuckerberg over acquiring Facebook, but rejected Zuckerberg&#x27;s offer to sell Facebook to him for $75 million. Some employees of MySpace, including DeWolfe and Berman, were able to purchase equity in the property before MySpace and its parent company eUniverse (now renamed Intermix Media) were bought.

===2005–2009: Purchase by News Corp. and peak years===
In July 2005, in one of the company&#x27;s first major Internet purchases, News Corporation purchased MySpace for US$580 million. At the time of the acquisition, the company was seeing 16 million monthly users and was growing exponentially. News Corporation had beat out Viacom by offering a higher price for the website, and the purchase was seen as a good investment at the time. Within a year, MySpace had tripled in value from its purchase price. News Corporation saw the purchase as a way to capitalize on Internet advertising and drive traffic to other News Corporation properties.

After the acquisition, MySpace continued its exponential growth. In January 2006, the site was signing up 200,000 new users a day. A year later, it was registering 320,000 users a day, and had overtaken Yahoo! to become the most visited website in the United States. ComScore said that a key driver of the site&#x27;s success in the US was high &quot;engagement levels&quot;, with the average MySpace user viewing over 660 pages a month.

In January 2006, Fox announced plans to launch a UK version of MySpace. During 2006, MySpace launched localized versions in 11 countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas, including MySpace China with Solstice. At the time, Travis Katz, senior vice-president for international operations, reported that 30 million of the site&#x27;s 90 million users were coming from outside of the United States.

The 100 millionth MySpace account was created on August 9, 2006, in the Netherlands. That same month, MySpace signed a landmark advertising deal with Google that guaranteed MySpace $900 million over three years, over 55% more than the price News Corporation had paid to acquire the business. In exchange, Google received exclusive rights to provide Web search results and sponsored links on MySpace. When the deal was signed, Google chairman Eric Schmidt said, &quot;When we looked at what was growing on the Web, all our internal metrics pointed to [MySpace] [...] It&#x27;s important to move Google to where users are, and that is where user-generated content is.&quot;

By October 2006, MySpace had grown from generating $1 million in revenue per month to $30 million per month, half of which came from the Google deal. The remaining 50% came from display advertising sold by MySpace&#x27;s in-house sales team. In November 2006, Myspace announced a 50-50 joint venture with Softbank to launch the site in Japan.

In mid-2007, MySpace was the largest social-networking site in every European country where it had created a local presence. By July 2007, Nielsen//NetRatings reported the company&#x27;s &quot;active reach&quot;, or the percentage of the population that visited the site, was anywhere from 10 to 15 times higher in Spain, France and Germany than for runner-up Facebook; in the United Kingdom, MySpace led Facebook by two-to-one in terms of reach.

MySpace would even land deals with major corporations like Sony. In 2007 MySpace partnered with Sony BMG, a Sony record label, to put music directly on the MySpace platform. Sony became interested in MySpace as they had 110 million users and had a lot of musical artists make their start on the platform.

On November 1, 2007, MySpace and Bebo joined the Google-led OpenSocial alliance, which already included Friendster, Hi5, LinkedIn, Plaxo, Ning, and Six Apart. The alliance&#x27;s goal was to promote a common set of standards for software developers to write programs for social networks. Google had been unsuccessful in building its own social networking site Orkut in the American market, and was using the alliance to present a counterweight to Facebook.

By late 2007 and into 2008, MySpace was considered the leading social networking site, and consistently beat out its main competitor Facebook in traffic. Initially, the emergence of Facebook did little to diminish MySpace&#x27;s popularity; at the time, Facebook was targeted only at college students.

At its peak, when News Corporation attempted to merge it with Yahoo! in 2007, Myspace was valued at $12 billion and had more than 300 million registered users.

===2009–2016: Decline and sale by News Corporation===
On April 19, 2008, Facebook overtook MySpace in Alexa rankings. In May 2009, Facebook surpassed MySpace in the number of unique U.S. visitors. From that point, Myspace saw a consistent loss of membership. There are several suggested explanations for its decline, including the fact that it stuck to a &quot;portal strategy&quot; of building an audience around entertainment and music, whereas Facebook and Twitter continually added new features to improve the social networking experience.

A former MySpace executive suggested that the $900 million three-year advertisement deal with Google, while being a short-term cash windfall, was a handicap in the long run, as it required MySpace to place even more ads on its already heavily advertised space, which made the site slow, more difficult to use and less flexible. MySpace could not experiment with its own site without forfeiting revenue, while Facebook was rolling out a new, clean site design. MySpace CEO Chris DeWolfe reported that he had to fight Fox Interactive Media&#x27;s sales team, who monetized the site without regard to user experience. In 2012, Katz described how News Corporation had put significant pressure on MySpace to &quot;focus on near-term monetization, as opposed to thinking about long-term product strategy,&quot; while Facebook focused user engagement over revenue.

Danah Boyd, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, noted of social networking websites that &quot;companies might serially rise, fall, and disappear, as influential peers pull others in on the climb up—and signal to flee when it&#x27;s time to get out.&quot; The volatility of social networks was exemplified in 2006, when Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal launched an investigation into children&#x27;s exposure to pornography on MySpace. The resulting media frenzy and the site&#x27;s lack of an effective spam filter gave the site a reputation as a &quot;vortex of perversion&quot;. Around that time, specialized social media companies such as Twitter formed and began targeting users on MySpace, while Facebook rolled out communication tools that were seen as safe in comparison to MySpace. In addition, MySpace had particular problems with vandalism, phishing, malware, and spam, which it failed to curtail, making the site seem inhospitable.

These have been cited as factors why users, who as teenagers were MySpace&#x27;s strongest audience in 2006 and 2007, had been migrating to Facebook, which started strongly with the 18-to-24 group (mostly college students) and has been much more successful than MySpace at attracting older users.

News Corporation chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was said to be frustrated that MySpace never met expectations as a distribution outlet for Fox studio content and missed the US$1 billion mark in total revenues. This resulted in DeWolfe and Anderson gradually losing their status within Murdoch&#x27;s inner circle of executives, as well as DeWolfe&#x27;s mentor Peter Chernin, president and COO of News Corporation, departing the company in June 2009. Former AOL executive Jonathan Miller, who joined News Corporation in charge of the digital media business, was in the job for three weeks when he shuffled MySpace&#x27;s executive team in April 2009. MySpace president Tom Anderson stepped down while Chris DeWolfe was replaced as CEO by former Facebook COO Owen Van Natta. A meeting at News Corporation over the direction of MySpace in March 2009 was reportedly the catalyst for that management shakeup, with the Google search deal about to expire and the departure of key personnel (Myspace&#x27;s COO, SVP of engineering, and SVP of strategy) to form a startup. Furthermore, the opening of extravagant new offices around the world was questioned, as Facebook did not have similarly expensive expansion plans but still attracted international users at a rapid rate. The changes to MySpace&#x27;s executive ranks were followed in June 2009 by a layoff of 37.5% of its workforce (including 30% of its U.S. employees), reducing employees from 1,600 to 1,000.

The downfall of MySpace can be attributed to many different factors. One of which was the demographic of MySpace and how they reacted to the debut of Facebook. When MySpace was launched, many of its users were people who never really used the internet before. As time went on, many users start to become frustrated with the very limited features of MySpace. Facebook launched with many quality of life features that MySpace simply did not have. So, a lot of users began to migrate from MySpace to Facebook.

According to Tim Vanderhook, the CEO of MySpace when it was owned by Viant, MySpace was killed by a “calculated takedown by Google over music”. Vanderhook alleges that Google used their recent acquisition of YouTube to take away a lot of the music deals they otherwise would have gotten by getting artists to put music on YouTube instead of MySpace. This utterly crippled MySpace as they had come to rely on the content of musical artists. Vanderhook also alleges that Google used their search engine algorithm to steer users away from MySpace and towards YouTube.

In 2009, MySpace implemented site redesigns as a way to get users back. However, this may have backfired, as users generally disliked tweaks and changes on Facebook.

In March 2011, market research figures released by Comscore suggested that Myspace had lost 10 million users between January and February 2011, and had fallen from 95 million to 63 million unique users in the previous 12 months. Myspace registered its sharpest audience declines in February 2011, as traffic fell 44% from a year earlier to 37.7 million U.S. visitors. Advertisers were reported as unwilling to commit to long-term deals with the site.

In late February 2011, News Corporation officially put the site up for sale for an estimated $50–200 million. Losses from the last quarter of 2010 were $156 million, over double the previous year, which dragged down the otherwise strong results of News Corporation. The deadline for bids, May 31, 2011, passed without any above the reserve price of $100 million being submitted. It has been said that the decline in users during the most recent quarter deterred several potential suitors.

On June 29, 2011, Myspace announced in an email to label partners and press that it had been acquired by Specific Media for an undisclosed sum, which was rumored to be as low as $35 million. CNN reported that the site sold for $35 million, and noted that it was &quot;far less than the $580 million News Corp. paid for Myspace in 2005.&quot; Murdoch went on to call the Myspace purchase a &quot;huge mistake&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine compared it to Time Warner&#x27;s 2000 purchase of AOL, which saw a conglomerate trying to stay ahead of the competition. Many former executives have gone on to further success after departing Myspace.

===2016-2019: Time Inc. and Meredith Corporation ownership===

On February 11, 2016, it was announced that Myspace and its parent company had been bought by Time Inc. On January 31, 2018, Time Inc. was in turn purchased by Meredith Corporation, who went on to sell a number of Time Inc.&#x27;s assets, including (as it announced on November 4, 2019) selling its equity in Viant, the parent company of Specific Media, back to Viant Technology Holding Inc.

In May 2016, the data for almost 360 million Myspace accounts was offered on TheRealDeal dark market website, which included email addresses, usernames, and weakly encrypted passwords (SHA1 hashes of the first 10 characters of the password converted to lowercase and stored without a cryptographic salt). The exact data breach date is unknown, but analysis of the data suggests it was exposed around eight years before being made public, around mid-2008 to early 2009.

===Since 2019: Viant Technology Holding Inc. ownership===
In March 2019, Myspace lost all content before 2016 after a faulty server migration.

As of October 5, 2024, Myspace was placed in a read-only mode of sorts, as no new articles have been published since early 2022, However, most images on the site were broken, and existing songs also could not be played.

Media uploads are now working and MySpace&#x27;s official account has also started some new activity. The terms of service of Myspace have not been changed by Viant. The privacy policy was last revised on 24 June 2024.

==Features==
From YouTube&#x27;s founding in 2005, Myspace users could embed YouTube videos in their profiles. Considering this a competitive threat to its new Myspace Videos service, the site in late 2005 banned embedded YouTube videos from user profiles, which was widely protested by Myspace users, prompting the site to lift the ban shortly after.

There were a variety of environments in which users could access Myspace content on their mobile phones. In early 2006, mobile phone provider Helio released a series of mobile phones utilizing a service known as Myspace Mobile to access and edit one&#x27;s profile and communicate with and view the profiles of other members. Additionally, UIEvolution and Myspace developed a mobile version of Myspace for a wider range of carriers, including AT&amp;T, Vodafone and Rogers Wireless. In August 2006, Myspace began offering classified ads, a service which grew by 33 percent during the following year. It previously had an instant messaging tool called MySpace IM. Myspace used an implementation of Telligent Community for its forum system.

===Music===
Shortly after Myspace was sold to News Corporation in 2005, the website launched a record label called MySpace Records, with JD Mangosing as CEO, in an effort to discover unknown talent on Myspace Music, a service onto which artists can upload songs, EPs and full-length albums. As of June 2014, over 53 million songs had been uploaded to the site by 14.2 million artists. Artists including My Chemical Romance, Nicki Minaj, Lily Allen, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry gained fame and recognition through Myspace. over eight million artists had been discovered by users through the site. In late 2007, the site launched &quot;The MySpace Transmissions&quot;, a series of live-in-studio recordings by well-known artists.

On March 18, 2019, it was revealed that Myspace had lost all of its user content from launch until 2015 in a botched server migration with no backup. Over 50 million songs and 12 years&#x27; worth of content were permanently lost. In April 2019, the Internet Archive recovered 490,000 MP3s &quot;using unknown means by an anonymous academic study conducted between 2008 and 2010&quot;. The songs, which were uploaded between 2008 and 2010, are collectively known as the &quot;MySpace Dragon Hoard&quot;.

Since early 2022, music upload and playback have been disabled on the website.

===MySpaceTV===
On May 16, 2007, Myspace partnered with news publications National Geographic, the New York Times and Reuters to provide professional visual contents on its social-networking Web site.
On June 27, 2007, Myspace launched MySpaceTV.

On August 8, 2007, Myspace partnered with satire publication &quot;The Onion&quot; to provide audio, video and print content to the site.

On October 22, 2007, Myspace launched its first original web series, &quot;Roommates&quot;, which intended to give its users a television-like experience with the interactive benefits of the Internet.

On February 27, 2008, TMZ launched its web channel on MySpaceTV.

On April 21, 2008, Myspace signed a deal with Byron Allen&#x27;s Entertainment Studios that brought programming such as the syndicated series &quot;Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen&quot;, &quot;Entertainers with Byron Allen&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Homes and Great Estates&quot;, and &quot;Designer Fashions &amp; Runways&quot; to MySpaceTV.

===Redesigns===
On March 10, 2010, Myspace added new features including a recommendation engine for new users that suggests games, music and videos based on their previous search habits. The security on Myspace was also enhanced, with the criticism of Facebook, to make it a safer site. The security of Myspace enables users to choose if the content could be viewed for &quot;friends only&quot;, &quot;18 and older&quot; or &quot;everyone&quot;.

In October 2010, Myspace introduced a beta version of a new site design on a limited scale, with plans to switch all interested users to the new site in late November. Chief executive Mike Jones said the site was no longer competing with Facebook as a general social networking site; instead, it would be music-oriented and would target younger people. Jones believed most younger users would continue to use the site after the redesign, though older users might not. The goal of the redesign was to increase the number of Myspace users and the time they spent on the site. BTIG (.com) analyst Richard Greenfield said, &quot;Most investors have written off MySpace now,&quot; and was unsure whether the changes would help the company recover.

In November 2010, Myspace changed its logo to coincide with the new site design. The word &quot;my&quot; appears in the Helvetica font, followed by a symbol representing a space. The logo change was announced on October 8, 2010, and appeared on the site on November 11. In the same month, Myspace integrated with Facebook Connect – calling it &quot;Mash Up with Facebook&quot; in an announcement widely seen as the final act of acknowledging Facebook&#x27;s domination of social networking.

In January 2011, it was announced that the Myspace staff would be reduced by 47%. User adoption continued to decrease.

In September 2012, a new redesign was announced, with no date given, making Myspace more visual and apparently optimized for tablets. The redesign was publicly released on January 15, 2013; by April 2013 (and presumably before), users were able to transfer to the new Myspace redesign. In June 2013, the redesign deleted all previous blogs, angering many users, and destroying information that would have been useful history in later years.

==Corporate information==
===Foreign versions===
Since early 2006, Myspace has offered the option to access the service in different regional versions. The alternative regional versions present automated content according to locality (e.g., UK users see other UK users as &quot;Cool New People&quot;, and UK-oriented events and adverts, etc.), offer local languages other than English, or accommodate the regional differences in spelling and conventions in the English-speaking world (e.g., United States: &quot;favorites&quot;, mm/dd/yyyy; the rest of the world: &quot;favourites&quot;, dd/mm/yyyy).

===MySpace Developer Platform (MDP)===
On February 5, 2008, MySpace set up a developer platform allowing developers to share their ideas and write their own Myspace applications. The opening was inaugurated with a workshop at the MySpace offices in San Francisco two weeks before the official launch. The MDP is based on the OpenSocial API, which was presented by Google in November 2007 to support social networks to develop social and interacting widgets, and can be seen as an answer to Facebook&#x27;s developer platform. The first public beta of the MySpace Apps was released on March 5, 2008, with around 1,000 applications available.

===Myspace server infrastructure===
At QCon London 2008, MySpace Chief Systems Architect Dan Farino indicated that the site was sending 100 gigabits of data per second out to the Internet; 10 gigabits of which was HTML content and the remainder was media such as videos and pictures. The server infrastructure consists of over 4,500 web servers (running Windows Server 2003, IIS 6.0, ASP.NET and .NET Framework 3.5), over 1,200 cache servers (running 64-bit Windows Server 2003), and over 500 database servers (running 64-bit Windows Server 2003 and SQL Server 2005), as well as a custom distributed file system which runs on Gentoo Linux.

In 2009, MySpace began migrating from HDD to SSD technology in some of their servers, resulting in space and power usage savings.

===Revenue model===
Myspace operates solely on revenues generated by advertising, as its revenue model possesses no user-paid features. Through its site and affiliated advertising networks, the site collects data about its users and utilizes behavioral targeting to select the ads each visitor sees.

On August 8, 2006, search engine Google signed a $900 million deal to provide a search facility and advertising on MySpace.

===Third-party content===
Companies such as Slide.com and RockYou were all launched on Myspace as widgets providing additional functionality to the site. Other sites created layouts to personalize the site and made hundreds of thousands of dollars for its owners, most of whom were in their late teens and early twenties.

In November 2008, MySpace announced that user-uploaded content infringing on copyrights held by MTV and its subsidiary networks would be redistributed with advertisements to generate revenue for the companies.

===Acquisition of Imeem===
On November 18, 2009, MySpace Music acquired Imeem for less than $1 million. MySpace stated that they would be transitioning Imeem&#x27;s users and migrating their playlists over to MySpace Music. On January 15, 2010, MySpace began restoring Imeem playlists.

==Mobile application==
Along with its website redesign in June 2013, Myspace also completely redesigned their mobile application on the App Store. The app featured a tool for users to create and edit gif images and post them to their Myspace stream. The app also allowed users to stream available &quot;live streams&quot; of concerts. New users were able to join Myspace from the app by signing in with Facebook or Twitter or by signing up with email.

===Availability===

The Myspace mobile app is no longer available on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. The mobile web app can be accessed by visiting Myspace.com from a mobile device. However, the mobile web version is limited compared to the PC, for example, it is not yet possible to display a person&#x27;s bio (February 2025).

===Radio===
The app once allowed users to play Myspace radio channels from the device. Users could select from genre stations, featured stations and user or artist stations. A user could build their own station by connecting and listening to songs on Myspace&#x27;s desktop website. The user was given six skips per station. As of early 2022, the radio player no longer functions on Myspace.com.

<doc id="1270656" wikidata="Q683799" url="?curid=1270656" title="Monte Ceneri transmitter">
<text>The Monte Ceneri transmitter was first established as the nationwide medium-wave radio transmission station for Italian-speaking Switzerland in 1933. Located on Monte Ceneri in Ticino, it broadcast on a frequency of 558 kHz.

==1933 mast==
The original transmission mast – a 120-metre-high free-standing lattice tower insulated from the ground – was constructed in the Monte Ceneri pass (at 46°8&#x27;26&quot;N 8°54&#x27;56&quot;E). Today this tower is used for DAB and DVB-T broadcasting, for which purposes a 15-metre-high antenna has been added at the top, so that the full height of the mast is now 135 metres.

==1978 mast==
In 1978 a new facility for the Monte Ceneri transmitter was built north of Isone (at 46°8&#x27;19&quot;N 8°59&#x27;25&quot;E). This uses as its main antenna a 220-metre guyed lattice-steel mast insulated from the ground and, as backup, a T-antenna, which is suspended between two guyed tubular-steel masts. The main mast – which is the only tall guyed mast in Switzerland, as well as being the country&#x27;s second-tallest tower-type structure – is equipped with an elevator, the machinery of which is installed in a compartment just above the basement insulator.

Despite the location change, the old name of the transmitter was retained. On 30 June 2008 the transmitter was shut down. The Voice of Russia (VoR) subsequently expressed an interest in acquiring a licence to broadcast from the site using the 558 kHz frequency and on 9 February 2011 it received permission from the Swiss Federal Office of Communications to do so. VoR began transmissions from Monte Ceneri on 1 April 2011; it has been reported, however, that these will cease after 31 December 2012. In July 2016 the scheduled demolition of the nowadays unused mast has begun.

<text>John O&#x27;Hart (; 1824–1902) was an Irish historian and genealogist. He is noted for his work on ancient Irish lineage.

He was born in Crossmolina, County Mayo, Ireland. A committed Roman Catholic and Irish nationalist, O&#x27;Hart had originally planned to become a priest but instead spent two years as a police officer. He was an Associate in Arts at the Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast. He worked at the Commissioners of National Education during the years of the Great Famine. He worked as a genealogist and took an interest in Irish history. He died in 1902 in Clontarf near Dublin, at the age of 78.

O&#x27;Hart&#x27;s 800-page, &quot;The Irish and Anglo-Irish landed gentry&quot; (Dublin 1884), was reprinted in 1969, with an introduction by Edward MacLysaght, the first Chief Herald of Ireland. Another work, &quot;Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation&quot;, first published in 1876, has come out in several subsequent editions.

To complete his genealogies he used the writings of Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh, Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and O&#x27;Farrell, along with the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, for the medieval pedigrees. He used the works of Bernard Burke, John Collins and others to extend his genealogies past the 17th century.

==Stem of the Irish nation==
In his &quot;Irish Pedigrees&quot;, O&#x27;Hart presents the legendary origins of the Irish people, from the Biblical Adam and Eve through the kings of ancient Ireland. Irish tradition holds that every Irish person is descended from the king Milesius who emigrated from Spain in approximately 1700 BC, according to the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;. O&#x27;Hart started each of his genealogies with Adam, recording Milesius as his 36th descendant.

From the start; &lt;br&gt;
(1) Adam, his son&lt;br&gt;
(2) Seth, his son&lt;br&gt;
(3) Enos, his son&lt;br&gt;
(4) Cainan, his son&lt;br&gt;
(5) Mahalaleel, his son&lt;br&gt;
(6) Jared, his son&lt;br&gt;
(7) Enoch, his son&lt;br&gt;
(8) Methuselah, his son&lt;br&gt;
(9) Lamech, his son&lt;br&gt;
(10) Noah, his son&lt;br&gt;
(11) Japhet, his son&lt;br&gt;
(12) Magog, his son&lt;br&gt;
(13) Baoth, &quot;to whom Scythia came has his lot&quot;, his son&lt;br&gt;
(14) Phoeniusa Farsaidh (Fenius Farsa) King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(15) Niul, his son&lt;br&gt;
(16) Gaodhal (Gathelus), his son&lt;br&gt;
(17) Asruth, his son&lt;br&gt;
(18) Sruth (who fled Egypt to Creta), his son&lt;br&gt;
(19) Heber Scut (returned to Scythia), his son&lt;br&gt;
(20) Beouman, King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(21) Ogaman King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(22) Tait King of Scythia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(23) Agnon (who fled Scythia by sea with the majority of his people), his son&lt;br&gt;
(24) Lamhfionn (who led his people to Gothia or Getulia, where Carthage was afterwards built), his son&lt;br&gt;
(25) Heber Glunfionn, King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(26) Agnan Fionn King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(27) Febric Glas King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(28) Nenuall King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(29) Nuadhad King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(30) Alladh King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(31) Arcadh King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(32) Deag King of Gothia, his son&lt;br&gt;
(33) Brath, King of Gothia (who left Gothia with a large band of his people and settled in Galicia, Spain), his son&lt;br&gt;
(34) Breoghan, King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, his son&lt;br&gt;
(35) Bile, King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, and his son&lt;br&gt;
(36) Galamh (also known as Milesius of Spain), King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal.

According to O&#x27;Hart&#x27;s account, Milesius had four sons, Heber, Ir, Heremon, and Amergin, who were involved, with their uncle Ithe, in the invasion of ancient Ireland; Milesius, himself, had died during the planning. Amergin died during the invasion, without issue. It is from the four other invaders —
Heber, Ir, Heremon, and Ithe — from whom the Irish are alleged to descend. These, according to O&#x27;Hart, are the four lines from which all true Irish descend. Conn of the Hundred Battles was a descendant of Erimon, and Brian Boru was descended from both Heber and Conn.

<text>Elmer is a small lunar impact crater that is located to the south of Mare Smythii, near the eastern limb of the Moon. This crater is seen at a highly oblique angle from Earth, and the visibility is affected by libration. Elmer lies southwest of the crater Kreiken, and east-southeast of the larger Dale. This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with an interior floor that occupies about half the total diameter.

The crater was named by the IAU in 1976 after Charles Wesley Elmer, an amateur astronomer and the co-founder of PerkinElmer.

<text>The Commodore 900 (also known as the C900, Z-8000, and Z-Machine) was a prototype microcomputer originally intended for business computing and, later, as an affordable UNIX workstation. It was to replace the aging PET/CBM families of personal computers that had found success in Europe as business machines. The project was initiated in 1983 by Commodore systems engineers Frank W. Hughes, Robert Russell, and Shiraz Shivji.

In early 1983, Commodore announced an agreement with Zilog to adopt the Z8000 family of processors for its next generation of computers, conferring rights to Commodore to manufacture these processors and for Zilog to manufacture various Commodore-designed integrated circuit products. Zilog was to manufacture components for Commodore&#x27;s computers, allowing Commodore to expand its own semiconductor operation. Commodore had reportedly been developing its own 16-bit microprocessor, abandoning this effort to adopt the Z8000.

== Design ==

The C900 was a 16-bit computer based on the segmented version of the Zilog Z8000 CPU. Initial announcements indicated the use of a 10 MHz Z8001 processor, but earlier technical documentation suggested the use of a 6 MHz part and detailed the option of a Z8070 arithmetic processing unit (APU) running at 24 MHz. The specification as announced in 1984 featured 256 KB of RAM and a 10 MB hard drive, but subsequently settled on 512 KB of RAM and a 20 MB hard drive as the minimum configuration, with 40 MB and 67 MB hard drives offered as options. A minimum configuration system had been expected to provide only 128 KB of RAM and a 320 KB floppy drive, selling for under $1,000.

Two versions of the machine were developed: a workstation with pixel graphics and a multi-user system featuring a text-only display intended to act as a server for a number of connected character-based terminals. For the text-only configuration and for lower-resolution graphical output, the system employed the MOS Technology 8563 video controller, this supporting an colour textual display or a colour graphical display. The high-resolution display option employed 128 KB of dedicated video memory and featured hardware support for blitting operations, this being employed by a graphical environment featuring &quot;multiple overlapping windows&quot;.

The C900 ran Coherent, a UNIX-like operating system, claimed in publicity as being &quot;fully compatible with AT&amp;T&#x27;s Unix System V, version 5.2&quot;, although the Coherent system was generally regarded as merely providing a level of compatibility with Version 7 Unix. Some observers found the choice of an earlier form of Unix &quot;surprising&quot; given the availability of more recent versions and of Zilog&#x27;s commitment among other manufacturers to promote System V as the industry standard for Unix. Onyx Systems, a pioneer of Z8000-based systems running Unix, had previously delivered ports of Version 7 Unix and Unix System III for their computers.

Manufacturing of the system was to commence in 1985 at Commodore International&#x27;s West Germany plant, with availability in the United States announced for the third quarter of the same year, and with pricing starting from approximately $2,700. The machine was publicly demonstrated for the first time outside the US at the 1985 Hanover Fair, with interest in the product described as &quot;overwhelming&quot;. Ultimately, only fifty prototypes were made and sold as development systems before the project was cancelled.

The C900&#x27;s case is similar to the Amiga 2000&#x27;s but slightly larger.

<doc id="1270667" wikidata="Q3429397" url="?curid=1270667" title="S. Clay Wilson">
<text>Steve Clay Wilson (July 25, 1941 – February 7, 2021) was an American underground cartoonist and central figure in the underground comix movement. Wilson attracted attention from readers with aggressively violent and sexually explicit panoramas of lowlife denizens, often depicting the wild escapades of pirates and bikers. He was an early contributor to &quot;Zap Comix&quot;.

A striking feature of Wilson&#x27;s work is the contrast between the literate way in which his characters speak and think and the depraved violence in which they engage. As James Danky and Denis Kitchen wrote in their book, &quot;Underground Classics&quot;, &quot;He astonished and sometimes frightened his fellow cartoonists, though they saw it as pushing if not eviscerating the boundaries of taste. More than anyone, Wilson defined the boundaries of the medium.&quot;

The artist and characters sometimes take violence with a playful attitude, for example getting tired of fighting and agreeing to have sex instead of continuing a battle. Wilson&#x27;s later work became more ghoulish, featuring zombie pirates and visualizations of Our Lady of Guadalupe as a rotting vampire mother. In many respects, however, his work remained consistent with his emergence in the 1960s. In contrast to the many counterculture figures who moderated their more extreme tendencies and successfully assimilated into the mainstream of commercial culture, Wilson&#x27;s work remained troubling to mainstream sensibilities and defiantly ill-mannered.

== Early life ==
Wilson was born on July 25, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska to Lydia (née Lewis) and John William Wilson. His mother was a medical stenographer, while his father was a machinist. He attended the University of Nebraska and later trained as a medic in the United States Army.

He lived in Lawrence, Kansas and held odd jobs before moving to San Francisco in 1968.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Wilson&#x27;s first published work was in , an underground newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, which was soon followed by drawings for &quot;Grist&quot; magazine, a poetry journal published by John Fowler. (According to Charles Plymell, an editor of &quot;Grist&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s first published work was in 1966 in &quot;Grist&quot; #7 and then in &quot;Grist&quot; #9, also from that same year.) The first appearance of the Checkered Demon is said to have been in an ad in a later issue of &quot;Grist&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s portfolio was printed the following year in 1967, with subsequent printings later on in comic book form.

===Underground comix===

In California, Wilson met up with Charles Plymell, who was publishing Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Zap Comix&quot;. Wilson needed little persuasion to contribute to &quot;Zap&quot;. Wilson began collaborating with Crumb in late 1967, and all issues of &quot;Zap&quot; comix starting with #2 contain his work. It was in &quot;Zap&quot; #2 that Wilson widely debuted his most famous character, The Checkered Demon, a portly, shirtless being generally seen wearing checkered pants.

Wilson was also a frequent early contributor to another underground project, the &quot;Yellow Dog&quot; tabloid anthology. Wilson&#x27;s work was featured in all three issues of &quot;The Rip Off Review of Western Culture&quot;, published in 1972. The third issue (Nov./Dec. 1972) featured an extensive interview with Wilson by Robert Follett, the publication&#x27;s editorial director. Wilson was also a frequent contributor to &quot;Arcade&quot;, edited by Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith; as well as &quot;Weirdo&quot;, Crumb&#x27;s post-underground anthology published in the 1980s and early 1990s. Wilson&#x27;s underground comix work was praised by such counterculture icons as William S. Burroughs and Terry Southern.

===Painting===
&quot;The Art of S. Clay Wilson&quot;, published in 2006 by Ten Speed Press, covers his prints and paintings as well as his comics work.

===Book Illustrations===

His illustrations for Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Cities of The Red Night&quot; and &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; were published in German editions by 2001 Publishing. In 1994, he began interpreting classic children&#x27;s stories, illustrating Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, as he explained to interviewers Jon Randall and Wesley Joost:
:I did a children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Andersen&quot;. I always wanted to be a children&#x27;s book illustrator way back when, but I took some LSD and took a left turn graphically. We got William Burroughs to write us a little blurb on the back, but they misspelled Burroughs! How could they do that! The stories are pretty lugubrious—&quot;The Rose Elf&quot;, for instance—where the woman is kissing the &quot;cold blue dead lips&quot; of her lovers&#x27; head. Later versions leave all this stuff out. Disney takes a great old story and they &quot;bleach&quot; it—as they used to say about music. To make it palatable and generic. These stories are supposed to scare the shit out of little kids so they&#x27;ll eat all their broccoli.

The stories in &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Grimm&quot; (Cottage Classics, 1999) are &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;The Spirit in the Bottle&quot;, &quot;The Valiant Little Tailor&quot;, &quot;The Devil with the Three Gold Hairs&quot;, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;Bearskin&quot; and &quot;The Master Thief&quot;.

==Brain injury and later life==
On November 1, 2008, Wilson suffered a severe brain injury. After attending the Alternative Press Expo in San Francisco and drinking throughout the day, Wilson left the house of a friend and was found by two passersby, face down and unconscious between parked cars. Among his injuries were a fractured neck and left orbital bone; it is not known if he was assaulted or passed out and fell.

After a week in intensive care, Wilson was put on an accelerated therapy program, but he still showed major difficulty in summoning words, a common form of aphasia following a trauma of this sort. He had recovered enough to write his own signature in the first week of December, but continued to require hospitalization as of the end of December 2008, when a benefit was held to assist with his medical costs. Another benefit was held in Hollywood in March 2009. Wilson returned home in November 2009, able to draw well and speak a little but still requiring special care.

He married Lorraine Chamberlain, with whom he had been living for ten years, on August 10, 2010.

In early 2012, he was rushed to the hospital with a buildup of fluid on his brain. After having brain surgery and spending three weeks in rehab, he developed a blood clot in his leg that required another three months in a facility on bed rest, followed by rehabilitation. After that incident, he never fully regained his strength, and suffered further from dementia. He could no longer draw except for the odd face or cluster of geometric shapes or letters. He rarely spoke, but he could answer questions. He appeared to understand much of what was said to him, although he could not actively participate in a conversation.

== Death ==
Wilson died at his home in San Francisco on February 7, 2021.

== Tributes ==
Wilson&#x27;s artistic audacity has been cited by Robert Crumb as a liberating source of inspiration for Crumb&#x27;s own work. Recalling when he first saw Wilson&#x27;s work (in about 1968) Crumb said, &quot;The content was something like I&#x27;d never seen before, anywhere, the level of mayhem, violence, dismemberment, naked women, loose body parts, huge, obscene sex organs, a nightmare vision of hell-on-earth never so graphically illustrated before in the history of art... Suddenly my own work seemed insipid...&quot;

&quot;He showed us we had been censoring ourselves,&quot; said &quot;Zap&quot; cohort Victor Moscoso. &quot;He blew the doors off the church. Wilson is one of the major artists of our generation.&quot; Referring to his and the &quot;Zap&quot; crew&#x27;s status in art circles, Wilson himself said, &quot;If you&#x27;re not good enough to be a cartoonist, maybe you can be an artist.&quot;

<text>The Sottens Transmitter is the nationwide transmitter for French-speaking Switzerland. The transmitter is located at Sottens, Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. It is run on 765 kHz with a power of 600 kilowatts and is easily receivable during the night throughout the whole of Europe. Since 1989 the aerial used has been a centre-fed dipole fixed on the outside of a 188-metre-high grounded freestanding steel framework tower. Before 1989 a 190-metre high self-radiating, free standing steel framework tower was used as a transmission aerial.
The Sottens transmitter most recently broadcast the &quot;Option Musique&quot; radio programme from Radio Suisse Romande, up until 5 December 2010.

There is also a 125 metre tall free-standing lattice tower on the site. This tower was built in 1931 as one of a pair, which until 1958 carried between them a T-antenna for medium wave broadcasting. The second tower was dismantled in that year and rebuilt in Dole as a TV transmission tower. This tower is insulated from ground to form a tower radiator and is used as backup antenna.

After the shutdown of RSR on MW, the antenna was later used for ham radio experiments in February 2011, using both standard AM and DRM in the 80 m band.

<text>Christian Augustus Siebe (known by his middle name; 1788 – 15 April 1872) was a British engineer chiefly known for his contributions to diving equipment.

== Contribution to diving ==

In the 1830s the Deane brothers asked Siebe to make a variation of their smoke helmet design for underwater use. Later they turned to him to produce more helmets for diving operations. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet.

Colonel Charles Pasley, leader of the Royal Navy team that used Siebe&#x27;s suit on the wreck of suggested the helmet should be detachable from the corselet, giving rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving.

The company that carried his name Siebe Gorman Ltd was founded by him and his son-in-law, Gorman.

He is commemorated by a blue plaque on his former home in Denmark Street, London.&lt;ref name=&quot;english-heritage/plaques/siebe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other inventions==

Besides his contributions to diving he also invented: 
*a rotating water pump patented in 1828,
*A paper making machine,
*a Dial weighing scale,
*an ice-making machine.

In 1823, Siebe won the Vulcan medal from the Royal Society of Arts for an improved screw threading tool.&lt;ref name=&quot;gracesguide/Augustus-Siebe&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Siebe won many medals at the Great Exhibition in 1851 and the Paris Exhibition in 1855.

He died 15 April 1872 of chronic bronchitis, at his London home. He was buried at the West Norwood Cemetery.

<text>The Reserve Officer School (, &quot;RUK&quot;), located in Hamina, Finland, near the southeastern border, is responsible for the training of most Finnish reserve officers.

==Organisation==

The school organises two yearly courses of some 700 men and women. The School is organized into a five companies of reserve officer students and two supporting companies. The Reserve Officer course is organised at five companies:
*Spearhead Company (): infantry platoon leader and artillery forward observers
*Reconnaissance Company (): reconnaissance platoon and squad leaders, and artillery forward observers
*Firing Battery (): mortar platoon leaders, battery officers for artillery, artillery reconnaissance officers, various officer duties in anti-aircraft artillery and Naval and Air Force command centres
*Engineer Company (): combat engineer platoon leaders, EOD detachment leaders, anti-CBRN platoon leaders and anti-tank missile platoon leaders 
*Headquarters and Signal Company (): signals officers for various duties, logistics officers and military police officers.

In addition to the five companies of the Reserve Officer Course, the School has two companies consisting of ordinary conscripts:
*Jäger Company (), training military police companies and medics for FDF reserve. The company also organizes the NCO course for the conscripts of the Army Academy on military police and transportation fields.
*Transportation Company (), training drivers for FDF reserve.

Organizationally, Reserve Officer School is a battalion-level unit which belongs to the Army Academy. The unit was founded in 1920 and has operated continually with a single break from 1945 to 1947 when the Finnish officer training was stopped by order of the Allied Control Commission. Since its founding, the school has been situated in Hamina, with the exception of wartime 1939–45, when the school was evacuated to Niinisalo in Kankaanpää. During the years 1942–45, the school operated under the name of Officer School (). Since 1920, the School has trained over 174,000 reserve officers for the Finnish Defence Forces.

== The Status of Reserve Officer ==
Within the Finnish Defence Forces, the vast majority of officers advance through the ranks during their conscription, instead of being commissioned from without for a separate career path.

At the end of the basic training of eight weeks, some conscripts are selected for extra training as reserve NCOs (). After the seven-week phase I of the NCO school, usually organised in the brigade the conscript is serving in, some NCO students are selected to become Reserve Officers, who are trained at the Reserve Officer School. Both the Reserve NCOs and Reserve Officers serve for 11.5 months, while the majority of rank-and-file conscripts serve for 5.5 months.

Reserve Officer School trains reserve officers, most of whom do not continue in active service but are demobilised to the reserve at the end of their conscription. Their service obligation as reservists continues until the age of 60. The reserve officers do not have a military standing while in reserve but when called to active service, reserve officers rank with career officers. The activation may take place for voluntary exercises, for obligatory refresher exercises or, in emergencies, for extraordinary service or for mobilisation. Based on their performance during service in the reserve, reserve officers may be promoted to higher ranks. The highest rank for which reserve officers are eligible is major (in Navy, lieutenant commander), and in extremely rare cases, lieutenant colonel (in the Navy, commander. All officer promotions are decided by the President of Finland, both for career and reserve officers.

The training of a reserve officer is also an obligatory prerequisite for attending the National Defence University. Those conscript NCOs who are accepted to the National Defence University, are selected on the condition of passing a platoon-leader course that gives the equivalent training as the Reserve Officer School.

== The Training in the Reserve Officer School ==

After the first seven weeks of the NCO school, those most suitable for Reserve Officer training are selected on the basis of the first phase of schooling and the basic conscript phase.

In the Reserve Officer School students receive training for the duties of platoon leader (or equivalent). The curriculum includes studies in leadership, tactics and physical education. After a 3½-month-long course, they are promoted to officer cadets and sent to their &#x27;home&#x27; garrisons to train their wartime platoons from the recruits. After 5 months of service as officer cadets, they are promoted second lieutenants and discharged. Come war, they would ideally lead more or less the same platoon as they led at training time.

Traditionally, the training of a reserve officer has carried certain social distinction and has been tied to high positions in industry and economy. E.g. former Nokia CEO Jorma Ollila was the Chairman of his Reserve Officer course.

The high educational level of most reserve officers offers the Finnish Defence Forces a chance to fill many wartime vacancies on the basis of civilian professions. For instance, a manager of a civilian transportation company might have a wartime placement as a brigade-level logistics officer. Conscripts who are medical students or doctors are usually given special training to become reserve medical officers.

== Other Reserve Officer Training ==
Some special branches carry out their own reserve officer training. Among these are the Special and Para Jäger units of Utti Jaeger Regiment and officers for the armoured troops of the Armoured Brigade. Navy reserve officers are trained in Naval Warfare School and Air Force reserve officers in Air Force Academy.

Those reserve NCOs who show, during their service in the reserve, exceptional dedication and suitability for officer duties, may be trained on a separate &quot;aliupseerista upseeriksi&quot; (&quot;NCO to officer&quot;) course. Typically, they have a civilian occupation or profession that makes them ideal candidates for a wartime position requiring officer training. The FDF website cites ideal examples of a lawyer who would be trained to serve as a wartime military lawyer or a construction engineer who would serve as a heavy earthmoving equipment platoon leader.

Such courses are organised annually by the Reserve Officer School, together with the National Defence Training Association of Finland. The courses start in October with the reserve officer course of the conscripts who started their service in July and end in July with the reserve officer course of the conscripts who started serving in January. During this time, the reservists participate in 40 days of training and exercises in the Reserve Officer School, in addition to a large amount of distance-education. The reservists who pass the course are promoted second lieutenants on the Finnish Independence Day of the same year.

The Reserve Officer School also organises, in conjunction with the conscript course, the Military Leadership Course (), which gives a training corresponding the reserve officer training to those Finnish Defence Forces personnel who have at least NCO training but require a reserve officer training for service as chaplains or specialist officers (e.g. medical officers or engineering officers).

<text>Theophilus () was the High Priest in the Second Temple in Jerusalem from 37 to 41 CE according to Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. He was a member of one of the wealthiest and most influential Jewish families in Iudaea Province during the 1st century. A growing but still uncommon belief points to High Priest Theophilus as the person to whom the Gospel of Luke is addressed, but Theophilus is a common enough name that there are many other possibilities for the addressee of Luke&#x27;s Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. In its favor is the fact that in Luke Theophilus is called by the title Most Excellent (&quot;kratiste&quot;), indicating he held a political office like high priest, the ethnarch under the Romans. In Acts 1:1 he does not have this honorific indicating that he no longer held an office of the Roman government. This provides an unusual identifier that eliminates other candidates for whom such a change in office was not effected. 

The honorific, &quot;kratiste&quot;, would also provide evidence that the Gospel of Luke was written during his high priesthood, 37 to 41 CE. The period coincides with the reign of Gaius Caligula, his persecution and planned ethnocide of the Jews and Nazarenes, and the desecration of the Temple with his giant, idolatrous statue. 

Theophilus was the son of Ananus () and the brother of Eleazar, Jonathan, Matthias and Ananus, and 
Joshua Ben Ananus. all of whom served as High Priests. He was also the brother-in-law of Joseph Caiaphas, the High Priest before whom Jesus of Nazareth appeared. In addition, his son Matthias served as the next to the last High Priest before the destruction of the Temple by the Romans.

Archeological evidence confirming the existence of Theophilus, as an ossuary has been discovered bearing the inscription, &quot;Yehoḥanah (Johanna) daughter of Yehoḥanan (John) son of Thefilus (Theophilus) the High Priest&quot;. The details of this ossuary have been published in the &quot;Israel Exploration Journal&quot;. Therefore, Theophilus had at least one other son, named John, father to Johanna. 

The name Johanna appears twice in the New Testament in the Gospel of Luke. First as one of women healed by Jesus who travels with Jesus and the disciples to Jerusalem. Her second appearance also in the Gospel of Luke is on Easter Sunday when she and other women visits the empty tomb. It is unlikely, however, that the Johanna in the Gospel of Luke is the same Johanna as the one mentioned on the ossuary. According to Richard Bauckham, Johanna was &quot;the fifth most popular woman&#x27;s name in Jewish Palestine,&quot; and the Johanna of the Gospel of Luke was likely from Galilee, not from Jerusalem. High Priests took office when at least 30 years old (Hebrew reckoning). Caiaphas was thus probably older than Theophilus. It was unusual for a son-in-law to take precedence over a son. If Theophilus was in his thirties in the period 37-41 CE, then a granddaughter, Johanna, would not have been born in the period of the Gospels up to 30 CE.

<text>Politics of New York have evolved over time. The Democratic Party dominates politics in the state, with the Democrats representing a plurality of voters in New York State, constituting over twice as many registered voters as any other political party affiliation or lack thereof. It is considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; Democratic strongholds along with California and Illinois. Historically, New York was a swing state, as from its inaugural election in 1792 until the 1984 election, the state voted for the winning candidate all but seven times (1812, 1856, 1868, 1876, 1916, 1948, and 1968). It voted for the winning candidate 86% of the time; however, since 1988, the state has voted Democratic by large margins and frequently provides them over 60% of the vote. Democrats have also controlled the Assembly since 1971 and the Senate since 2019. New York currently has two Democratic United States senators. New York&#x27;s Class I Senate seat has been Democratic since 1959 and New York&#x27;s Class III Senate seat has been Democratic since 1999. In addition, New York&#x27;s House congressional delegation has had a Democratic majority since 1965.

==Current issues==
For a long time, same-sex marriages were not allowed in New York, but those marriages from other jurisdictions were recognized. In May 2008, Governor David Paterson issued an affirmation that the state would recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. In December 2009, the senate declined to pass a same-sex marriage bill, though polling earlier that year had indicated that a majority of New Yorkers supported same-sex marriages. Since 2004, the public pension systems of both the state and New York City allocate benefits in recognition of same-sex marriages performed outside New York. Former Governor Eliot Spitzer stated he would introduce legislation to legalize same-sex marriage. On April 27, 2007, then-Governor Spitzer unveiled such a bill. Same-sex marriage was legalized in June 2011.

From 1984 through 2004, no budget was passed on time. The state has a strong imbalance of payments with the federal government. New York State receives 82 cents in services for every $1 it sends to Washington in taxes. The state ranks near the bottom, in 42nd place, in federal spending per tax dollar. For decades, it has been the established practice for the state to pass legislation for some meritorious project, but then mandate county and municipal government to actually pay for it. New York State has its counties pay a higher percentage of welfare costs than any other state, and New York State is the only state which requires counties to pay a portion of Medicaid.

<text>Siebe Gorman &amp; Company Ltd was a British company that developed diving equipment and breathing equipment and worked on commercial diving and marine salvage projects. The company advertised itself as &#x27;Submarine Engineers&#x27;. It was founded by Augustus Siebe, a German-born British engineer chiefly known for his contributions to diving equipment.

Siebe plc started in the 1970s as a continuation of Siebe Gorman when Siebe Gorman started to take over other firms, to mean the new conglomerate to distinguish it from Siebe Gorman&#x27;s original breathing apparatus and diving gear core business. Siebe plc was once one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest engineering businesses. It was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but in 1999 it merged with BTR plc to form Invensys. Invensys was taken over by the French multinational Schneider Electric for £3.4 billion in January 2014.

==History==
*1788: Augustus Siebe was born in Saxony in Germany, named Christian Augustus Siebe. He was educated in Berlin and apprenticed to a brass founder.
*1812: He served as an artillery officer at the Battle of Leipzig and narrowly escaped death.
*1815: He served as an artillery officer in the Prussian army at the Battle of Waterloo.
*1816: After that war he moved to London, England. He became a watchmaker, then gunmaker, then instrument maker, and settled at 5 Denmark Street in Soho, London, where he became an engineer.
*1819: He started a business as a mechanical engineer at 145 High Holborn, London. He traded as Augustus Siebe and dropped the word &quot;Christian&quot; from his name. Down the years he produced various mechanical devices, not only diving gear.
*1819: He married Susannah Gliddon (from Devon).
*1819: He produced a breech-loading firearm.
*1823: He was awarded a Vulcan medal for a screw tap for thread cutting.
*1826: He moved to 5 Denmark Street, London, which he rented.
*1830: His daughter Mary Siebe was born. The company, by then trading as Siebe Gorman, developed its first diving helmet. (Later, William Augustus Gorman (formerly O&#x27;Gorman) (an Irish sea captain) married Mary Siebe.)

===Start of involvement in making diving equipment===

*1830: The Deane brothers asked Siebe to make a variation of their smoke helmet design for underwater use. Later they turned to him to produce more helmets for diving operations. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit (standard diving dress). The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet.
*1831: He bought 5 Denmark Street&#x27;s leasehold. He lived and worked there for the rest of his life.
*1856: He applied for and was given British citizenship.
*1868: He bought the freehold of 5 Denmark Street.
*1868: He retired because of old age and ill-health; 4 of his 5 sons had died by this time.
*1870: Augustus Siebe passed his business to his son Henry Herapath Siebe and to William Augustus Gorman. The business started trading as &#x27;Siebe &amp; Gorman&#x27;
*15 April 1872: He died at home of chronic bronchitis. He was buried at the West Norwood Cemetery.
*1876: Siebe &amp; Gorman moved to 17 Mason Street (later renamed Boniface Street), Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth, London.
*1878: Henry Fleuss with help from Siebe Gorman designed a practical oxygen rebreather: see Rebreather#History.
*1880: The company&#x27;s name changed to Siebe Gorman &amp; Co.
*January 1882: Robert Henry Davis (age 11) (1870–1965) joined Siebe Gorman as an office boy. Over the years he learned much and became good at breathing apparatus engineering.
*1887: Henry Herapath Siebe died aged 57.
*1894: Robert Davis was promoted to General Manager of Siebe Gorman.

===20th century===
*September 1900: Robert Davis married Margaret Tyrrell.
*1901: Robert Davis&#x27;s and Margaret Tyrrell&#x27;s first son Robert William Gorman Davis was born. Over the years Robert William Gorman Davis trained as an engineer and later joined the company.
*14 Feb 1904: William Augustus Gorman suddenly died aged 69. (He was buried at Claygate Church in Surrey.) The company became a new private company &#x27;Siebe Gorman &amp; Co. Ltd.&#x27;.
*1905: The Admiralty set up the first Deep Diving Committee.
*1907: The resulting naval diving tables appeared. The Admiralty approached Siebe Gorman to help develop better deep-diving gear.
*1907: The Siebe Gorman Proto industrial rebreather starts to be made. The Siebe Gorman Salvus and the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus appeared later.

*1930: The Admiralty set up the second Deep Diving Committee.
*1932: King George V knighted Robert Davis, largely for inventing the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus.
*1938: Robert Davis, needing more room for factory expansion, bought 6 acres at Tolworth near Chessington in Surrey. The new building on it was named Neptune Works, on Davis Road.

===WWII===
*1938/39: Siebe Gorman was one of a number of British companies to receive contracts for the manufacture of tens of thousands of gas masks including the &quot;British Civilian Duty Respirator&quot; (for Civil Defence &amp; related use) and the &quot;Respirator, Anti-Gas, Civilian Duty&quot; (for general public use).
*May 1941: Siebe Gorman&#x27;s factory in Lambeth was bombed during World War II. Massive loss of company and personal historical records.
*1941: The company, already planning to leave London, moved to Chessington, Surrey and resumed manufacturing. It has been speculated (although without any real evidence) that André Rubber located to the same area in order to supply Siebe Gorman.
*June 1943: Siebe Gorman were contracted by the 79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom) to design specialist apparatus for use by the Duplex Drive Tank crews. Known as the Amphibious Tank Escape Apparatus (ATEA) the equipment was fitted with a protosorb canister and enabled it to be used as a re-breather for up to 7 minutes. Tank crews would strap the inflated ATEA to their chests, and in the event of sinking, would fit the mouth piece and nose clips. The equipment was used extensively in training, during which crews perfected its operation in a water-filled cistern as well as on a submerged tank. No doubt it contributed to the saving of many lives especially on D Day where 35% of the tanks that swam towards the Normandy shore sunk due to the poor sea conditions. 1200 men were trained before D Day using the ATEA, and a further 300 for River Crossing.

===After WWII===
*1948: Siebe Gorman was making aqualungs of the type nicknamed &#x27;Tadpoles&#x27;.
*around 1950: Peak production of standard diving dress. After this, diving technological development in the USA more and more reduced Siebe Gorman&#x27;s business, which was halved by the early 1960s.
*1951: Birmingham University gave Robert Davis an honorary degree.
*1952: Siebe Gorman became a limited company. Robert Davis became its managing director.
*1952: Marconi and Siebe Gorman collaborated to produce an underwater television camera system.
*1953: Some sport divers find how to make an aqualung regulator out of a Calor gas demand regulator, and spread this knowledge, thus bypassing the naval/industrial monopoly on making usable underwater breathing apparatus.
*1954: Around now Siebe Gorman started making Cousteau-Gagnan-type aqualungs, and diving suits for commercial and sport diving. In September 1954, the inaugural issue of the British Sub-Aqua Club magazine &quot;Neptune&quot; contains a full-page Siebe Gorman advertisement for three sets of &quot;Essjee&quot; underwater breathing apparatus: The Standard Aqualung (single cylinder); The Twin Cylinder Aqualung (of double capacity) and The Junior Set (a smaller set than the Standard for use by young people). Special suits, swim fins, dive masks, etc. are also available.
*1955 or after: Siebe Gorman stops making standard diving dress. The 1955 underwater catalogue of the London sporting goods store Lillywhites offers the &quot;Essjee&quot; Standard Aqualung, Twin-Cylinder Aqualung and &quot;Tadpole&quot; Aqualung at £40, £65 and £38 respectively alongside the Essgee full-face mask for use with these breathing sets, the Essjee Mid-Season sponge-rubber wetsuit and the Essgee weight belt. In August 1955, Cogswell &amp; Harrison, another London stockist of Siebe Gorman equipment, places an advertisement in &quot;Neptune&quot; offering not only the &quot;Essjee&quot; single and twin aqualungs but also Siebe Gorman&#x27;s Mid-Season sponge-rubber wetsuit, its stockinette-lined drysuit and its proofed gabardine Grenfell drysuit.
*1956: The 1956 Lillywhites underwater catalogue introduces Siebe Gorman Mark II Essgee Aqualungs, &quot;now modified with decreased resistance to breathing and improved flow of air&quot;. The 1956 Cogswell &amp; Harrison catalogue features the Essgee breathing sets, Essgee Mid-Season sponge-rubber wetsuit, Essgee Grenfell proofed gabardine dry suit, Essgee two-piece dry suit &quot;based on experience with wartime frogmen&quot;, &quot;made of green rubberised cotton stockinette&quot; and the Essgee Continental two-piece dry suit &quot;in green vulcanised sheet rubber&quot;.
*1957: Essgee Mistral Aqualung introduced, made under Cousteau-Gagnan Patents with the general design features of the Spirotechnique &quot;Mistral&quot; and following on the lines of development of the Essgee Mark II with double-lever action to reduce opening resistance to a minimum. The Essgee Mistral Aqualung appears in the 1957 Lillywhites underwater catalogue alongside the Essgee Mark II Aqualung. From January 1957, Siebe Gorman run a series of advertisements in the British Sub-Aqua Club journal &quot;Triton&quot; offering &quot;everything for underwater swimming&quot; including the Essgee two-piece dry suit, the Essgee Continental two-piece dry suit and the Essgee Dive Mask Mark II.
*1959: The Fairey Aviation Company took over Siebe Gorman. From November 1959 to April 1960, Siebe Gorman run a series of advertisements in &quot;Triton&quot; celebrating the use of Siebe Gorman wetsuits and weight belts by the British team at the World Underwater Fishing Championships off Malta and Gozo in August 1959.
*1960s: Siebe Gorman started making scuba gear aimed at the public market (sometimes using the tradenames Essgee and Essjee), although they had made it earlier for work divers and the Navy. They also continued to make diving bell equipment and pressure chambers.
*1960: From May 1960 to June 1961, Siebe Gorman advertises a new range of Essgee Mid-Season foam neoprene wetsuits in &quot;Triton&quot;.
*1961: Siebe Gorman takes over the diving gear maker firm Heinke. A few helmets were given the tag of &quot;Siebe-Heinke&quot;, but eventually the name Heinke completely disappeared. The first Siebe-Heinke advertisement for the Heinke Merlin regulator appears in the December 1961 issue of the &quot;Royal Navy Diving Magazine&quot;.
*1962: In January, Siebe Gorman announces its merger with Heinke to &quot;Triton&quot; readers. From May 1962 to April 1963, the company advertises &quot;the new seamless Siebe, Heinke &#x27;dip suit&#x27;&quot; in &quot;Triton&quot;. The Siebe-Heinke Dip Suit, which makes its début at the London Boat Show in January 1962, is an economically priced lightweight dipped-latex dry suit with roll-seal waist entry, primarily designed for use by &quot;skin-divers&quot; but also readily adaptable for use by dinghy sailors, fishermen, canoeists and water skiers. The suit appears in Lillywhites underwater catalogues from 1962 to 1964. With effect from December 1962, Collins and Chambers Ltd. of London E14 are appointed sole UK spares distributors and servicing engineers for all Siebe-Heinke aqualung demand valves. Collins and Chambers subsequently become stockists of Siebe-Heinke equipment.
*1963: Siebe-Heinke &quot;Blue Book of underwater swimming 1963&quot; published. It comes with an introduction and a catalogue of underwater swimming equipment comprising not only the existing inventories of Siebe Gorman and Heinke but also new products including the &quot;Dip&quot; suit and the &quot;Mercury mouth-held demand valve manufactured in plastic&quot;, which was also advertised in &quot;Triton&quot; from May 1963 to June 1964.
*1964: Siebe-Heinke &quot;Blue Book of underwater swimming 1964-65&quot; published with content broadly resembling the 1963 edition but with an expression of regret that &quot;owing to manufacturing difficulties we can no longer supply complete Dip suits&quot;.
*1965: Robert Davis dies at home on 29 March 1965 at the age of 94. Siebe Gorman issues two leaflets entitled &quot;Aqualung equipment&quot;. The first focuses on the company&#x27;s breathing sets, while the second covers its range of dry underwater swimsuits, foam neoprene wet suits, woollen underclothing, gloves, footwear, weightbelts and weights, underwater knives and books. In the October 1965 issue of &quot;Triton&quot;, Siebe Gorman places an advertisement alerting readers to the company&#x27;s contribution to the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball: &quot;A large proportion of the underwater scenes for the film &#x27;Thunderball&#x27; were shot in a 150′ × 150′ tank in Pinewood. As the leading British exponents of diving, Siebe Gorman were asked to provide a team of divers whose duties were to ensure safety of the stars and cast of the film, as well as act as an underwater working party&quot;.
*1966: Triton publishes article about Siebe Gorman&#x27;s submersible decompression chamber.
*1967-8: Siebe Gorman stops using the tradename &#x27;Siebe Heinke&#x27;. About now, Siebe plc started as a continuation of Siebe Gorman when Siebe Gorman started to take over other firms, to mean the new conglomerate to distinguish it from Siebe Gorman&#x27;s original breathing apparatus and diving gear core business. &quot;See Siebe plc for more information.&quot;
*1969: Siebe Gorman issues new 20-page catalogue featuring a diver on the front cover in a &quot;dry frogman&#x27;s suit&quot; with an integral &quot;SeaCrown&quot; fibreglass helmet.
*1971: Using the slogan &quot;Be in the swim with NEPTUNE&quot;, Siebe Gorman introduces a new single-hose, two-stage diving regulator named &quot;Neptune&quot;.
*1975: Siebe Gorman moves to Cwmbran in Wales in 1975 and concentrates on firefighter&#x27;s breathing equipment.
*1979: &quot;Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd&quot; [1979] 2 Lloyd&#x27;s Rep 142, a well known UK insolvency law case about book debts in debentures.
*1995 October: Siebe Gorman still had their premises at Cwmbran.
*1998: Siebe plc sold North Safety Products (and Siebe Gorman with it) to Norcross.
*End of 1998: Norcross closed the plant at Cwmbran and transfers production of breathing apparatus to Dukinfield in Manchester, where they still had capability to make oxygen rebreathers, but did not make or overhaul any there.
*End of 1999: Norcross sold what had been Siebe Gorman as a going concern to an Iranian entrepreneur Parvis Moradifor. The company was renamed Air Master Technology Limited (AMtec) from the name of the famous Siebe Gorman breathing apparatus. (Norcross itself was subsequently purchased by Honeywell for its industrial safety products. Therefore, Honeywell&#x27;s North line of respiratory protective equipment can be traced back to Siebe Gorman &amp; Company Ltd.)

===21st century===
*2000: Air Master Technology relocated to Swindon in Wiltshire.
*2001: Air Master Technology ceased trading.
*2001: Parvis Moradifor sells the assets and the name &quot;Siebe Gorman&quot; to a Malaysian concern, who with a factory in Malaysia, still make breathing apparatus and parts for civilian and military use, including an industrial breathing set under the name Siebe Gorman. their name is &quot;Siebe Gorman Sdn. Bhd.&quot;
* By 2014, the company has relocated to Australia.
* According to Companies House, Siebe Gorman &amp; Company was dissolved on 9 April 2019.
* In August 2017 the Deane Helmet, which had been rescued by John Bevan when Siebe Gorman closed down, was put on display at the Diving Museum in Gosport.

==Operations==
The Company was notable for developing the &quot;closed&quot; diving helmet of the standard diving dress and associated equipment. As the helmet was sealed to the diving suit, it was watertight, unlike the previous &quot;open&quot; helmet systems. The new equipment was safer and more efficient and revolutionised underwater work from the 1830s.

Colonel Charles Pasley, leader of the Royal Navy team that used Siebe&#x27;s suit on the wreck of suggested the helmet should be detachable from the corselet, giving rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving.

Standard diving suit equipment was their main manufacturing operation, producing diving helmets in copper and brass. They also made frogman&#x27;s equipment for the British armed forces during World War 2, and later, sport scuba gear. See makes of rebreather.

Siebe Gorman and Co manufactured 12 bolt, 8 bolt, 6 bolt, 3 bolt, 2 bolt, no bolt, flange, and 12 bolt square corselet standard diving helmets.

Heinke Ltd in London also made diving gear and had connections with Siebe Gorman.

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem or Kirchhoff&#x27;s matrix tree theorem named after Gustav Kirchhoff is a theorem about the number of spanning trees in a graph, showing that this number can be computed in polynomial time from the determinant of a submatrix of the graph&#x27;s Laplacian matrix; specifically, the number is equal to &quot;any&quot; cofactor of the Laplacian matrix. Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem is a generalization of Cayley&#x27;s formula which provides the number of spanning trees in a complete graph.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem relies on the notion of the Laplacian matrix of a graph, which is equal to the difference between the graph&#x27;s degree matrix (the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees) and its adjacency matrix (a (0,1)-matrix with 1&#x27;s at places corresponding to entries where the vertices are adjacent and 0&#x27;s otherwise).

For a given connected graph &quot;G&quot; with &quot;n&quot; labeled vertices, let &quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2, ..., &quot;λn&quot;−1 be the non-zero eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix. Then the number of spanning trees of &quot;G&quot; is

:formula_1

An English translation of Kirchhoff&#x27;s original 1847 paper was made by J. B. O&#x27;Toole and published in 1958.

== An example using the matrix-tree theorem ==

First, construct the Laplacian matrix &quot;Q&quot; for the example diamond graph &quot;G&quot; (see image on the right):

: formula_2

Next, construct a matrix &quot;Q&quot;* by deleting any row and any column from &quot;Q&quot;. For example, deleting row 1 and column 1 yields

: formula_3

Finally, take the determinant of &quot;Q&quot;* to obtain &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), which is 8 for the diamond graph. (Notice &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the (1,1)-cofactor of &quot;Q&quot; in this example.)

== Proof outline ==

(The proof below is based on the Cauchy–Binet formula. An elementary induction argument for Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem can be found on page 654 of Moore (2011).)

First notice that the Laplacian matrix has the property that the sum of its entries across any row and any column is 0. Thus we can transform any minor into any other minor by adding rows and columns, switching them, and multiplying a row or a column by −1. Thus the cofactors are the same up to sign, and it can be verified that, in fact, they have the same sign.

We proceed to show that the determinant of the minor &quot;M&quot;11 is the number of spanning trees. Let &quot;n&quot; be the number of vertices of the graph, and &quot;m&quot; the number of its edges. The incidence matrix &quot;E&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;m&quot; matrix, which may be defined as follows: suppose that (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) is the &quot;k&quot;th edge of the graph, and that &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;. Then &quot;Eik&quot; = 1, &quot;Ejk&quot; = −1, and all other entries in column &quot;k&quot; are 0 (see oriented incidence matrix for understanding this modified incidence matrix &quot;E&quot;). For the preceding example (with &quot;n&quot; = 4 and &quot;m&quot; = 5):

:formula_4

Recall that the Laplacian &quot;L&quot; can be factored into the product of the incidence matrix and its transpose, i.e., &quot;L&quot; = &quot;EE&quot;T. Furthermore, let &quot;F&quot; be the matrix &quot;E&quot; with its first row deleted, so that &quot;FF&quot;T = &quot;M&quot;11.

Now the Cauchy–Binet formula allows us to write

:formula_5

where &quot;S&quot; ranges across subsets of [&quot;m&quot;] of size &quot;n&quot; − 1, and &quot;FS&quot; denotes the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-by-(&quot;n&quot; − 1) matrix whose columns are those of &quot;F&quot; with index in &quot;S&quot;. Then every &quot;S&quot; specifies &quot;n&quot; − 1 edges of the original graph, and it can be shown that those edges induce a spanning tree if and only if the determinant of &quot;FS&quot; is +1 or −1, and that they do not induce a spanning tree if and only if the determinant is 0. This completes the proof.

== Particular cases and generalizations ==

=== Cayley&#x27;s formula ===

Cayley&#x27;s formula follows from Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem as a special case, since every vector with 1 in one place, −1 in another place, and 0 elsewhere is an eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph, with the corresponding eigenvalue being &quot;n&quot;. These vectors together span a space of dimension &quot;n&quot; − 1, so there are no other non-zero eigenvalues.

Alternatively, note that as Cayley&#x27;s formula gives the number of distinct labeled trees of a complete graph &quot;Kn&quot; we need to compute any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of &quot;Kn&quot;. The Laplacian matrix in this case is
:formula_6

Any cofactor of the above matrix is &quot;nn&quot;−2, which is Cayley&#x27;s formula.

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem for multigraphs ===

Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem holds for multigraphs as well; the matrix &quot;Q&quot; is modified as follows:
* The entry &quot;qi,j&quot; equals −&quot;m&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is the number of edges between &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;;
* when counting the degree of a vertex, all loops are excluded.
Cayley&#x27;s formula for a complete multigraph is by same methods produced above, since a simple graph is a multigraph with &quot;m&quot; = 1.

=== Explicit enumeration of spanning trees ===

Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem can be strengthened by altering the definition of the Laplacian matrix. Rather than merely counting edges emanating from each vertex or connecting a pair of vertices, label each edge with an indeterminate and let the (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;)-th entry of the modified Laplacian matrix be the sum over the indeterminates corresponding to edges between the &quot;i&quot;-th and &quot;j&quot;-th vertices when &quot;i&quot; does not equal &quot;j&quot;, and the negative sum over all indeterminates corresponding to edges emanating from the &quot;i&quot;-th vertex when &quot;i&quot; equals &quot;j&quot;.

The determinant of the modified Laplacian matrix by deleting any row and column (similar to finding the number of spanning trees from the original Laplacian matrix), above is then a homogeneous polynomial (the Kirchhoff polynomial) in the indeterminates corresponding to the edges of the graph. After collecting terms and performing all possible cancellations, each monomial in the resulting expression represents a spanning tree consisting of the edges corresponding to the indeterminates appearing in that monomial. In this way, one can obtain explicit enumeration of all the spanning trees of the graph simply by computing the determinant.

For a proof of this version of the theorem see Bollobás (1998).

=== Matroids ===
The spanning trees of a graph form the bases of a graphic matroid, so Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem provides a formula for the number of bases in a graphic matroid. The same method may also be used to determine the number of bases in regular matroids, a generalization of the graphic matroids .

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem for directed multigraphs ===
Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem can be modified to give the number of oriented spanning trees in directed multigraphs.
The matrix &quot;Q&quot; is constructed as follows:
* The entry &quot;qi,j&quot; for distinct &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; equals −&quot;m&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; is the number of edges from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot;;
* The entry &quot;qi,i&quot; equals the indegree of &quot;i&quot; minus the number of loops at &quot;i&quot;.
The number of oriented spanning trees rooted at a vertex &quot;i&quot; is the determinant of the matrix gotten by removing the &quot;i&quot;th row and column of &quot;Q&quot;

=== Counting spanning &quot;k&quot;-component forests ===
Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem can be generalized to count -component spanning forests in an unweighted graph. A -component spanning forest is a subgraph with connected components that contains all vertices and is cycle-free, i.e., there is at most one path between each pair of vertices. Given such a forest &quot;F&quot; with connected components formula_7, define its weight formula_8 to be the product of the number of vertices in each component. Then
:formula_9

where the sum is over all -component spanning forests and formula_10 is the coefficient of formula_11 of the polynomial
:formula_12
The last factor in the polynomial is due to the zero eigenvalue formula_13. More explicitly, the number formula_10 can be computed as
:formula_15
where the sum is over all &quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;-element subsets of formula_16. For example

formula_17

Since a spanning forest with &quot;n&quot;−1 components corresponds to a single edge, the &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot;−1 case states that the sum of the eigenvalues of &quot;Q&quot; is twice the number of edges. The &quot;k&quot; = 1 case corresponds to the original Kirchhoff theorem since the weight of every spanning tree is &quot;n&quot;.

The proof can be done analogously to the proof of Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem. An invertible formula_18 submatrix of the incidence matrix corresponds bijectively to a &quot;k&quot;-component spanning forest with a choice of vertex for each component.

The coefficients formula_10 are up to sign the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of &quot;Q&quot;.

<doc id="1270696" wikidata="Q141764" url="?curid=1270696" title="Huntingdon, Quebec">
<text>Huntingdon is a small town in Huntingdon County in the Haut-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality, and the Montérégie region of the province of Quebec, Canada. The population as of the 2021 Canadian census was 2,556. The town is southwest of Montreal, and from the border with New York State.

==History==
The town was settled by British soldiers after the War of 1812 and the fertile land in the area led to a successful farming economy. Once the fear of attack from the Americans was gone, in the 1820s businessmen established lumber and grist mills on the banks of the Châteauguay River.

During the first few decades of the 20th century, when transport from major urban centers to the outlying rural areas became economically feasible, the textile industry began expanding at a rapid rate in various towns throughout the province of Quebec. By the 1930s, Huntingdon was home to a small but thriving textile industry founded by Alex Fawcett &amp; Hiram Leach as Leach Textiles. After World War II, entrepreneurs François Cleyn and Alec Tinker acquired the textile businesses in Huntingdon and built their company, Cleyn &amp; Tinker Limited, into one of the most successful woolen mills in all of Canada. In Huntingdon, the business expanded to five interconnected operations around the town. The decades of the 1950s through to the early part of the 1970s saw the town prosper and the company acquire subsidiaries in Sherbrooke, Quebec and in Castlecomer, Kilkenny, Ireland.

===Recent history===
Huntingdon was also home to Huntingdon Mills (Canada) Ltd., another textile business and a significant employer in the town. In December 2004, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and announced they would have to close, putting more than 215 employees out of work. Cleyn &amp; Tinker too announced it would be closing its operations in the town in April 2005. Shortly after the announcement, some of the company&#x27;s assets and supply contracts were acquired by the Greensboro, North Carolina–based International Textile Group, Inc. who have a partnership with China Ting Group, a textile manufacturer based in Kabul, Afghanistan. On January 28, 2005, Mayor Stéphane Gendron announced that the town was purchasing the five textile plants that were closing with the expectation that they could be sold to new businesses.

The small town had to deal with a substantial increase in teen vandalism. In August 2004 a controversial municipal bylaw went into effect that placed a 10:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew on unsupervised children aged 15 and under. The controversial bylaw held parents responsible for their children&#x27;s activities through fines if a child was caught in violation of the curfew. After parents filed a legal action to have the bylaw overturned, the Council suspended application of the bylaw.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Huntingdon had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Sport==
Huntingdon was the midway point of the Boston–Montreal–Boston cycling event.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
The CIT du Haut-Saint-Laurent formerly provided commuter and local bus service, until it was cut back to Ormstown and Sainte-Martine. Current service is provided by the Haut-Saint-Laurent regional county municipality.

==Media==
The town is served by a fortnightly English newspaper, &quot;The Gleaner,&quot; with a French section called, &quot;Le Gleaner.&quot; It was founded in 1863 by Robert Sellar (1841-1919) under the banner &quot;Canadian Gleaner&quot;, changing its name to the &quot;Huntington Gleaner&quot; in 1912. The Huntingdon Gleaner was owned by various family businesses for most of its history. Even though it was technically a private business, local ownership conveyed the title of ‘community newspaper’ as is typical across Canada. Eventually, the Huntingdon Gleaner added a French language section in 1993 called La Source (back-to-back format) and became known as &quot;The Gleaner/La Source&quot;. As consolidation in the print media began at the turn of this century, The Gleaner/La Source was sold by the local owner to what became a series of re-sales to various media chains: Les Hebdos Montérégiens in 1985, Quebecor in 2011 and finally Transcontinental in 2013. In 2015, The Gleaner/La Source ceased publication as a standalone newspaper, with The Gleaner becoming an 8-page insert in the regional free-distribution weekly Le Journal St-Francois (Valleyfield), and La Source being closed completely. In 2017, Transcontinental sold Le Journal St-Francois (including The Gleaner) to a regional media company, Gravité Média. In 2018, Gravité Média reached out to the English-speaking community in the Châteauguay Valley to see if there was any interest in acquiring the title. Rather than simply close The Gleaner, Gravité Média wanted to respect the heritage integral to the publication and provide the opportunity for the English-speaking community to continue to be served by a community newspaper. In November 2018, a public meeting was held in Ormstown, along with representatives from Gravité Média, to discuss the possibilities surrounding the community acquiring the rights to continue publishing The Gleaner.

From that meeting, a “Future of the Gleaner” steering committee was formed, followed shortly by the establishment of a non-profit organization the Chateauguay Valley Community Information Services and discussions were held with Gravité Media to acquire the assets of &quot;The Gleaner&quot; (title, web domain,  etc.) and a transfer agreement was signed in May 2019. In June 2019, The Gleaner was re-launched with a souvenir print version and a new website, followed by monthly editions in August, September, October and November 2019 and a fortnightly edition stating in January 2020.

He attended Harvard where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965, where he created the Ashoka Table, bringing in prominent government, union, and church leaders for off-the-record dinners at which students could ask &quot;how things really worked&quot;. Drayton entered Balliol College, Oxford and received a Master of Arts degree in 1967. He attended Yale Law School where he received his Juris Doctor in 1970.

During the administration of President Jimmy Carter (1977–1981), Drayton was an Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency where he launched emissions trading, among other reforms. He founded the group Save EPA after he left.

Drayton has served as a visiting professor at Harvard University and Stanford University.

== Awards ==

The American Society of Public Administration and the National Academy of Public Administration jointly awarded him their National Public Service Award and he has also been named a Preiskel–Silverman Fellow for Yale Law School and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

On May 25, 2009, Drayton was awarded an honorary degree, Doctorate of Humane Letters, by Yale University at commencement.

David Gergen has called Drayton the &quot;godfather of social entrepreneurship.&quot; And in 2008, Drayton was named a &quot;visionary&quot; as one of Utne Reader magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Visionaries Who Are Changing the World&quot;.

In 2011, Drayton won Spain&#x27;s prestigious Prince of Asturias Awards for international cooperation for his work promoting entrepreneurs. The prize foundation described him as a &quot;driving force behind the figure of social entrepreneurs, men and women who undertake innovative initiatives for the common good&quot;.

Within the next two weeks, Drayton also accepted the John W. Gardner Leadership award, &quot;established in 1985 to honor outstanding Americans who exemplify the leadership and the ideals of John W. Gardner&quot;, and the World Entrepreneurship Forum&#x27;s Social Entrepreneur Award.

In 2012, Drayton was named an inaugural recipient of Middlebury College&#x27;s Center for Social Entrepreneurship Vision Award, in recognition of the impact of his contributions to the field of social entrepreneurship.

<doc id="1270703" wikidata="Q224985" url="?curid=1270703" title="Lovers of the Arctic Circle">
<text>Lovers of the Arctic Circle (), also known as The Lovers from the North Pole, is a 1998 Spanish romantic drama film written and directed by Julio Médem and starring Najwa Nimri and Fele Martínez. It won two Goya Awards in 1999.

The film tells the story of Otto and Ana from their chance meeting outside school at the age of 8, until they meet again in their 20s in Lapland within the Arctic Circle, under the midnight sun. The themes developed in the film form an important part of Julio Medem&#x27;s universe, and can be found in his other movies; these include love, death, destiny, nature, the circle of life and the coincidences in life. It received favorable critical reviews.

==Plot==
The movie (told from the point of view of the two main characters), opens with Otto hanging from a tree by a parachute after surviving a fateful plane crash. In voiceover he reflects on how he met Ana, his stepsister and secret lover.

17 years earlier, when Ana and Otto are 8, Otto first sees Ana while rushing to retrieve a soccer ball in the forest outside their school, and is smitten immediately. Ana&#x27;s voiceover reveals that she is also very struck by him, but nothing is spoken. She had run into the forest in grief over her father&#x27;s death and at first she thinks Otto might be her father&#x27;s reincarnation, but dismisses the idea after studying her father&#x27;s photo in an album and finding absolutely no resemblance between him and Otto.

The next morning Otto writes a question about love on dozens of paper airplanes and sends them flying over the schoolyard. They&#x27;re read by everyone, including Ana&#x27;s mother Olga and Otto&#x27;s father Álvaro, who meet for the first time while commenting on this question. After exchanging a few words, Álvaro offers Olga and her daughter a ride.

Otto hears his father yelling his name, and runs to the car. When he opens the car door, he&#x27;s shocked to see Ana in the back seat. She greets him warmly and openly; through her point of view we learn that she knows his name from his father&#x27;s yelling and that she&#x27;s surprised and delighted to see him again. They ride in the back seat. While their parents talk, Otto&#x27;s voiceover reveals that he&#x27;s hopelessly in love with Ana and wonders how she feels about him.

Neither child has siblings; Olga is a widow, and Otto&#x27;s parents are divorced. His mother Yolanda isn&#x27;t taking that too well. Otto feels for her, but he is delighted when his father marries Ana&#x27;s mother: he will be close to his one true love.

The story moves forward several years. The two children are now in their middle teens, their unprofessed love fanatically hidden from their parents.

Otto&#x27;s mother has never gotten over her divorce and Otto is a comfort to her. He&#x27;s concerned about her welfare and feels responsible for keeping her happy, but his longing for Ana overpowers him.

Desire finally eclipses responsibility, and Otto moves in with his father, desperate for Ana&#x27;s love. One night they&#x27;re doing homework together and they discuss Finland, the Arctic Circle, and the Midnight Sun. They fall silent and Ana rests her head on Otto&#x27;s chest and listens to his heartbeat. They make out.

Soon after, during a family barbecue, Ana passes Otto a note inviting him to her bedroom. That night he goes to her. At last they confront their feelings and become lovers.

Several more years pass and we see that they&#x27;ve succeeded in keeping their affair a secret, in spite of the fact that they&#x27;re conducting it right under their parents&#x27; noses. However, Yolanda has sunk deeper into depression since Otto&#x27;s departure. Finally, feeling abandoned by both husband and son, she commits suicide. Otto, guilt-ridden and bereaved, leaves his father&#x27;s house one morning without saying a word, and essentially disappears. In utter despair, Ana locks herself in her room and cries, refusing to answer when her mother asks her what&#x27;s wrong. She leaves home. Becomes a schoolteacher.

Time passes. Otto falls into a series of fatuous affairs. During one of them, the subject of his mother comes up. He tells the girl &quot;She died of love&quot; and when the girl asks &quot;How does one die of love?&quot; he answers, &quot;She died abandoned.&quot;

Ana and Otto almost meet again in a park. They arrive separately and sit with their backs to each other, each unaware of the other&#x27;s presence. Otto sits alone; Ana is approached by a man who wants to talk to her. All they would need to do is turn around to see the other sitting there, but this never happens and it&#x27;s clear that something karmic has been shattered.

Ana begins a relationship with the man in the park. Meanwhile, her mother Olga is seduced away from Álvaro by another man, also named Álvaro, and ends their marriage. Otto returns home to find Ana and Olga gone and his father distraught over Olga leaving him.

Running through the story like a thread is the subplot of how Otto got his name:

There was a German fighter pilot during WWII named Otto and related to Yolanda, whose plane crashed in Finland. He fell in love with a woman.

The other Otto understands that because he has left Ana, he has been left without a destiny. He becomes a pilot like his namesake and flies to Finland, a twist of fate which Olga cheerfully communicates to Ana via a video. Soon after, Ana&#x27;s affair with the man in the park turns dangerously sour and she&#x27;s forced to get away from him. Olga&#x27;s lover knows someone who has a cabin in Finland: it&#x27;s none other than the man for whom Otto was named, the German pilot whose plane crashed during WWII. Olga&#x27;s lover makes clear that the cabin is just sitting there empty and that the German pilot would willingly let Ana use it until the crisis with her lover blows over.

Ana accepts, and writes a letter to her stepbrother: She wants them to meet in Finland. The time has come to reclaim their love. Flying to the cabin, Ana looks out and sees Otto&#x27;s cargo plane, but doesn&#x27;t even think that it might be his. Almost simultaneously, Otto looks out the window of his cargo plane and sees the 747 Ana is on, but is equally oblivious.

Ana arrives at the cabin, and sits outside in a straight back chair, waiting for Otto to arrive. When he doesn&#x27;t, she panics.

Meanwhile, Otto is hanging from a tree, having survived a plane crash just like his namesake, and getting his parachute caught in the branches... Bringing us to the beginning of the film.

Hearing that a cargo plane has crashed, Ana frantically tries to find out if it was Otto&#x27;s. Tearing through the local newspaper looking for clues, gets hit by a truck on her way across the street. By this time Otto has been rescued and hitched a ride with his rescuers.

There&#x27;s a final, two-part epilogue:

In the first part, Ana crosses the street instead of getting hit by the truck. She runs up the stairs of an apartment building and is greeted by the German pilot who tells her that someone inside the apartment is waiting for her. She goes inside and sees Otto who&#x27;s smiling warmly. They exchange soft words, and she embraces him, making it the perfect reunion. Until it&#x27;s seen that Ana&#x27;s eyes are wide open and dilated and that Otto&#x27;s face is reflected in the lenses.

In the second part, Otto and his rescuers have stopped at an intersection. Otto, seeing Ana sprawled on the pavement, gets out of the car and runs to her. It then cuts to their reunion (which is only a dream), and it&#x27;s revealed that Otto&#x27;s face in Ana&#x27;s eyes is the reflection of him leaning over her as she sees him one last time before dying.

We see a shot of Otto&#x27;s destroyed cargo plane in the snow.

== Cast ==
==Production==

<text>Sergeant Major Edgar Foshee, a devout anti-communist, served as a combat medic in the U.S. Army Special Forces. His former wife Thuong Nguyen Cuc Foshee was held without formal charge by the government of Vietnam starting in September 2005. She was eventually convicted of terrorism and returned to the United States in November 2006 after her early release for medical problems.

==Biography==
In 1974, he retired from the United States Army, and later retired as an agent from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He had served in Vietnam with both organizations, assisting the South Vietnamese government against the Communist North Vietnamese Army and their Viet Cong agents.

He owned a construction company until 1980, and retired with his wife to Florida.

On April 30, 1995, he was appointed Chairman of the International Committee of an exiled anti-communist organization known as The Government of Free Vietnam.

<text>Microsoft Media Server (MMS), a Microsoft proprietary network-streaming protocol, serves to transfer unicast data in Windows Media Services (previously called NetShow Services). MMS can be transported via UDP or TCP. The MMS default port is UDP/TCP 1755.

Microsoft deprecated MMS in favor of RTSP (TCP/UDP port 554) in 2003 with the release of the Windows Media Services 9 Series, but continued to support the MMS for some time in the interest of backward compatibility. Support for the protocol was finally dropped in Windows Media Services 2008.

 Microsoft still recommends using &quot;mms://&quot; as a &quot;protocol rollover URL&quot;. As part of protocol rollover a Windows Media Player version 9, 10, or 11 client opening an &quot;mms://&quot; URL will attempt to connect first with RTSP over UDP and if that fails it will attempt RTSP over TCP. After an RTSP attempt fails, Windows Media Player versions 9 and 10 will attempt MMS over UDP, then MMS over TCP. If using Windows Media Player 11 and an RTSP attempt fails, or if using a previous version of Windows Media Player and MMS fails, a modified version of a HTTP over TCP connection will be attempted. This modified version is referred to by some third parties as MMSH, and by Microsoft as MS-WMSP (Windows Media HTTP Streaming Protocol). The uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme codice_1 has also been proposed to be used for the unrelated Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) protocol.

For several years developers of the SDP Multimedia download-tool reverse engineered the MMS protocol and published unofficial documentation for it. However, Microsoft finally released the protocol specification in February 2008.

<text>Kvitsøy Tower is the name for the aerial tower of the 1200 kilowatt transmitter of the broadcasting company of Norway for the frequency 1314 kHz, which was built in 1981/82. Kvitsøy-Tower was a 117.5 metres high, free standing centre-fed half-wave antenna constructed of a grounded steel framework. Horizontal crossbars were located at its top and at a height of 67.5 metres above ground to support the cables for a medium wave aerial, which were strung parallel to the tower. The vertical cables hanging from the lower crossbar were fixed to the ground with anchors.

The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK switched off the Kvitsøy transmitter at 22:00 UTC on Friday June 30, 2006. For years, the station had been heard fairly reliably at night by DX&#x27;ers along the Atlantic Coast of North America making it one of the easiest European stations to hear. The mast was demolished on 31 May 2012.

<text>Landspeeders are fictional anti-gravity craft used through the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies and &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe. They are depicted both in civilian and military capacities, and several versions have been merchandised as toys and models.

== Origin and design ==
Landspeeders first appear in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Two of them—Luke Skywalker&#x27;s (Mark Hamill) X-34 and a V-35—were designed by noted special effects artist John Stears and were fitted around cars. Skywalker&#x27;s landspeeder was designed and built by Ogle Design around the chassis of a Bond Bug three-wheeler car. One of the major challenges the production crew faced was disguising the wheels to create the illusion that the craft was hovering. For certain shots, they shot from camera angles that masked the wheels; for long-distance shots, they used reflective material, gelatin on the camera lens, and shadow effects. A small blur could be seen under the speeder, which George Lucas called &quot;The Force Spot&quot; (stated in Special Edition Tape). Production designer Roger Christian used an angled mirror and a broom attached to the vehicle&#x27;s underside to create, at certain angles, the illusion that the craft was hovering and kicking up dust. &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas used digital technology to enhance the landspeeder effects in the Special Edition of &quot;A New Hope&quot;.

Industrial Light and Magic&#x27;s (ILM) Doug Chiang designed the Naboo Flash speeder with a &quot;race car look&quot; while the Gian speeder&#x27;s appearance is ILM&#x27;s response to Lucas&#x27; request that the Naboo troops have &quot;a pick-up truck with guns.&quot;

The landspeeder was put on display in the exhibit &quot;Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination&quot; that moved between various museums in 2008.

==Depiction==

Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, speeder is a generic term for any &quot;repulsorcraft&quot; or vehicle which uses anti-gravity repulsorlift technology to hover and fly above a planet&#x27;s surface. Landspeeders more specifically use repulsor technology to hover just above the ground, while they cannot achieve any great height they are cheap and fast. Many different types of landspeeders exist in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe to fulfill a variety of roles, including for personal transport.

;In &quot;Star Wars&quot; Film and Television
*X-34 Landspeeder: In &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) pilots an X-34 landspeeder, which he later sells before leaving Tatooine to join the Rebel Alliance. Reference material identifies the X-34 as a civilian vehicle manufactured by SoroSuub Corporation. At long, the X-34 can accommodate a pilot and passenger, while magnetic clamps behind the seating can accommodate droids or other cargo. Other features include retractable windshield which can enclose the cockpit, terrain scanner and night-vision headlights. With three turbine engines, it has a top speed of and maximum altitude of .
*Flash Speeder: Flash speeders appear in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; as one of several patrol vehicles used by the Royal Naboo Security Forces. Designed for street patrol and high-speed pursuit by the SoroSuub Corporation, the Flash speeder is long with seating for a pilot and passenger and maximum altitude of . It is armed with a single pursuit/defense blaster on a 360° swivel mount.
*Gian Speeder: Gian speeders appear in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; as another landspeeder used by the Royal Naboo Security Force. Unlike the Flash speeder though, reference material identifies the Gian speeder as a heavier vehicle only employed for tactical situations. Also manufactured by the SoroSuub Corporation, the Gian has a top speed of . Its narrower body makes it harder to hit from the front or rear at the expense of maneuverability and its tougher hull is reinforced with armor to withstand glancing hits. Larger than the Flash speeder with a length of , the Gian speeder seats a pilot, gunner and two passengers. Standard armaments include two side-mounted light repeating laser cannons, with the option of a hood-mounted heavy laser cannon. Each weapon is independently powered in the event the speeder&#x27;s main generator is damaged.
*M-68 Landspeeder: The M-68 landspeeder first appears in &quot;&quot; when Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) and Qi&#x27;ra (Emilia Clarke) hijack one to escape the White Worms gang. Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the M-68 is described as a popular street racing model manufactured by Mobquet Swoops and Speeders. Nicknamed the &quot;street blaster bolt&quot;, the M-68 has a top speed of and is available in both hardtop and open-air models.
*A-A4B Truckspeeder: When Han and Qi&#x27;ra attempt to flee the White Worms gang in &quot;Solo&quot;, they are pursued by Moloch in an A-A4B Truckspeeder. Described as a heavy, rugged design, the A-A4B was built in-universe by Trast Heavy Transports with armored caging over the driver&#x27;s seat and front grille, turning the landspeeder into a batter ram during high-speed chases.

== Cultural impact ==

Luke Skywalker&#x27;s X-34 landspeeder was one of fifty fictional vehicles selected for display at the Petersen Automotive Museum&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Dream Machines&quot; exhibition which focused on the most significant or important vehicles to feature in the science fiction and fantasy genre. The X-34 was chosen not just for its role in the plot but also it&#x27;s thematic contribution to the film.

Many &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans have been inspired to build &quot;working&quot; full-scale replicas of Luke&#x27;s X-34 landspeeder. Daniel Deutsch built a drivable replica in 2007 using parts from an electric golf cart and fiberglass molding. The replica achieved fame when it was highlighted by former &#x27;N Sync member Joey Fatone and rapper Kanye West. Celebrity YouTube inventor Colin Furze created another replica in 2019 in celebration of the release of &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. The only known full-scale metal model of the X-34, it was sold on eBay for £50,000, with all proceeds going to BBC’s ‘Children In Need’.

Landspeeders have served as a source of inspiration for &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans across artistic communities. Digital artist Brad Builds created a landspeeder version of the Pontiac GTO themed around Darth Vader. French photographer Renaud Marion reimagined 9 classic cars as landspeeders as part of a project called Air Cars. Reimagined models included the Porsche 356 and Aston Martin DB5.

Although they operate on different principles, flying cars are often compared to &quot;Star Wars&quot; landspeeders in popular media. The SkyDrive SD-03 flying car specifically was inspired in part by Luke Skywalker&#x27;s landspeeder.

Landspeeders have featured heavily in &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandising since their inception. Examples includes Lego models, a drivable Radio Flyer toy, and a cat bed.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Sōsuke Kaise. It was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot; from April 2002 to March 2005, with its chapters collected in seven volumes. In North America, the manga was initially licensed by Tokyopop and released in print from 2006 to 2008. It was later licensed for digital release by Viz Media and released in 2015.

A 12-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Studio Live and Group TAC, and directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, was broadcast on Wowow from October 2004 to January 2005. The series was licensed in North America by Media Blasters.

==Plot==

&quot;Grenadier&quot; follows the travels of Rushuna Tendō, an expert gunfighter, and the samurai Yajirō Kojima, a mercenary swordsman. A Senshi or &quot;Enlightened&quot; is one who is skilled to some degree in the use of guns. The series begins with Yajirō and a small army of samurai launching a frontal assault against a fort in an attempt to free their lord, which was taken over by a group of gunners. The assault fails.

Yajirō orders a retreat, but is spotted by the enemy and chased to a small cliff, which he jumps off of to escape. With his pursuers still following, he follows a nearby hot-water stream upcurrent where he finds Rushuna bathing in a hot spring. She seems undisturbed by his presence or her own nudity and hides him in the hot spring with her ample breasts as cover until the enemy passes them by. After this, she introduces herself as a traveler and reveals the ultimate battle strategy to Yajirō; to avoid battle by removing an enemy&#x27;s will to fight.

Hearing the gunfire of the renewed assault upon the fort, Yajirō leaves Rushuna to rejoin combat. He arrives in time to see the leader of the gunners use a Gatling gun to decimate the samurai. Rushuna also arrives at this point and shows her considerable gun talent and effectively ends the battle by defeating the lead gunner and rescuing the lord by herself.

Something in him changing, Yajirō decides to become Rushuna&#x27;s partner and travel with her.

During their travels, Rushuna and Yajirō face a mysterious masked figure known only as &quot;The Jester&quot; who is responsible for a weapon called &quot;Enlightened Evil&quot;. Then they discover that Tenshi, who sent Rushuna to travel in order to learn the &quot;Ultimate Battle Strategy&quot;, had apparently put a price on her head. Joined by a young balloon maker named Mikan Kurenai, Rushuna and Yajirō make their way to the capital of Tento. Along the way they overcome many of the Juttensen, Tenshi&#x27;s elite personal bodyguard.

When the three reach Tento, they discover the truth and the final showdown against the Jester begins.

====Episodes====
==Reception==
;Manga
:&quot;If you prefer your action stories free of humor and completely serious then this series isn&#x27;t for you. But if you like the idea of a skimpily-clad lead female character who reloads her revolver by bouncing six bullets out of her cleavage and loading them into her gun in midair then you should check out this title.&quot; — Matthew Alexander, &quot;Mania&quot;.
:&quot;Yes, Rushuna is eye-candy and there are plenty of upskirt shots to keep most otaku happy, but she&#x27;s also a complete badass with a gun. Hopefully future volumes will develop her character more so this isn&#x27;t all we have to judge her on.&quot; — A. E. Sparrow, &quot;IGN&quot;.
;Anime
:&quot;The character of Yajiro is a refreshing change from the typical male sidekick seen in this genre. Rushuna&#x27;s character is not quite as appealing at the start, but her ties to the underlying main plot, along with the plot itself, have great potential.&quot; — Luis Cruz, &quot;Mania&quot;.
:&quot;Well, Rushuna seems to have a penchant for baths and hotsprings, which means nudity of the non-explicit variety. There are also a lot of battles and fights, which does lead to red shirt death and bleeding wounds. Things never get really messy, though, so the show is probably fine for teenagers.&quot; — Stig Høgset, &quot;T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews&quot;.

<doc id="1270729" wikidata="Q1191210" url="?curid=1270729" title="Girls Bravo">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by and serialized from 2000 to 2005 in &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; by Kadokawa Shoten. The story focuses on a high school boy who is allergic to girls who is transported to a mysterious world with a mostly female population; when he returns, one of the girls from that world becomes his housemate.

The anime adaptation of &quot;Girls Bravo&quot;, directed by Ei Aoki and animated by AIC Spirits, aired in Japan from 2004 to 2005. There are 24 episodes total. The anime series was released in English by Geneon, and the manga was released in English by Tokyopop. A visual novel was also released for the PlayStation 2.

In July 2010, Funimation Entertainment released a statement on their Twitter feed confirming that they have licensed &quot;Girls Bravo&quot;.

==Plot==
Yukinari Sasaki is an average high school student who is frequently ridiculed by girls to the point that he developed an allergic reaction to them. As a result, he breaks out in hives whenever he comes into contact with a female. One day, when he returns home from school, he is kicked into his bathtub by his neighbor Kirie Kojima, but is transported to , a mysterious world with a mostly female population. He befriends Miharu Sena Kanaka, who ends up following him to Earth. Other Seiren girls with various motives soon visit and join the household. They are taken on many adventures as Miharu discovers the wonders of Earth.

==Characters==
===Main===
 
: Yukinari has been ridiculed by girls all his life, and has developed an extreme case of gynophobia in which he suffers an allergic reaction whenever he comes into contact with one. One day, after he is kicked into his bathtub by Kirie Kojima, his next door neighbor, he is transported to the alien world of Seiren, a planet where men comprise less than 10% of the population. He meets Miharu who does not trigger his allergy. She follows him back to Earth and is the main cause of his misadventures involving girls and subsequent abuse by Kirie.
 
: Miharu is a resident of Seiren who pulls Yukinari Sasaki to Seiren and follows him back to Earth to live with him. She has a mark on her forehead shaped like three dots in a triangle called Seikon, which provides her with several powers, including the ability to travel between Seiren and Earth and the power to create explosions whenever she is in emotional distress. She is also the only woman who can touch Yukinari without triggering his allergy. Miharu has a large appetite and a rapid metabolism. On Earth, much of her focus is in questioning her friends as to whether something is edible or not (like butterflies), and her continuous misunderstandings about Earth (such as believing that April Fools&#x27; Day means that everyone on Earth lies for one day) are the title&#x27;s primary source of humor. Despite this, she has a heart of gold, an explorer&#x27;s fascination with Earth, and has a close relationship with Yukinari. She is an extremely innocent girl who does not show any discomfort with being partially or fully naked in front of Yukinari, and she does not lose her temper even when made the target of Fukuyama&#x27;s lecherous actions, unless the process involves food or disrupts her eating time.
 
: Kirie is Yukinari Sasaki&#x27;s next door neighbor, classmate, and childhood friend who takes care of him from time to time since. She is especially well-endowed, which makes her a natural target for Kazuharu Fukuyama&#x27;s perversions. However, due to her physical aptitude and martial-arts abilities, she always defeats him. She regularly beats up Yukinari Sasaki for his bad luck. Kirie inadvertently sends Yukinari to Seiren for the first time when she slugs him for innocently walking in on her when she was showering in his bathroom. Despite their often turbulent relationship, Kirie has a deep affection for Yukinari and usually tries to help him. Because of her strong character and appearance, Kirie attracts a large number of admirers among the boys in her high school, in particular Kazuharu Fukuyama who often molests and gropes her whenever he has the chance to. In the manga, Kirie is accosted by an alternate version of Lisa Fukuyama when she enters a parallel world through an enchanted mirror in Fukuyama&#x27;s house. In the anime adaptation, she also attracts female admirers, specifically Kosame and Hijiri Kanata, much to her displeasure. A running gag throughout the series is Kirie&#x27;s complete lack of cooking skills which result in the creation of food that is inedible and dangerous. Kirie has a fear of ghosts and the paranormal, and despite her tomboyish character enjoys collecting dolls.
 of which O&#x27;Brien received a nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy at the American Anime Awards. 
: Fukuyama is a classmate of Yukinari Sasaki and Kirie Kojima. Fukuyama is a rich, powerful, corrupt, perverted, selfish, and arrogant boy, and while he often chases girls and insults Yukinari by calling him , he does show a serious, caring side in critical situations. He suffers androphobia to the point that he has developed an allergy that causes him to break out with a rash whenever he comes into contact with another male. He often appears without the others noticing until he announces his presence, whereupon he either gropes or strips the girls of their clothing, which always earns him a severe beating from Kirie. For unknown reasons despite sexually assaulting many girls including Kirie herself, he has never suffered consequences from the law. Despite his own lecherous behavior, Fukuyama is highly protective of his younger sister, Lisa, and strongly objects to her affections for Yukinari.
 
: Lisa is Kazuharu Fukuyama&#x27;s slightly insane younger sister. Lisa is a master of black magic, which causes several issues throughout the series such as infesting her family&#x27;s mansion with ghosts, summoning a giant octopus in the school swimming pool, and causing an explosion within a shopping center. Lisa is constantly accompanied by Hayate and Kosame, who cater to her every whim such as gathering intelligence or even kidnapping. She develops an infatuation for Yukinari after his appearance matches a description in her horoscope for her soul mate and often employs her magic to get closer to him—with predictably disastrous results. Although she considers Miharu a rival, she is very fond of Ebi, who reminds her of the pet cat she owned when she was a little girl. In the anime adaptation, Ebi&#x27;s girl form reminds her of a doll she used to spend her days with, which she reunites with later on thanks to Tomoka&#x27;s magic.

: Koyomi is an androphobic resident of Seiren. She has fear of men on Earth and her phobia is only made worse by being one of Kazuharu Fukuyama&#x27;s favorite targets; in the manga, she keeps a diary of how many times he has accosted her. Originally sent to Earth on a mission from the Space Travel Agency to &#x27;retrieve&#x27; Miharu Sena Kanaka, she later moves into Yukinari&#x27;s house along with her companion Tomoka Lana Jude on a prolonged mission to find a husband for Miharu&#x27;s sister Maharu. However, her fear of men makes the act of even talking to a man nearly impossible. Koyomi&#x27;s favorite pastime is reading, but she has a natural talent for table tennis, having won a tournament for a similar sport on Seiren. In the anime adaptation, Koyomi is also searching for her father, a native of Earth, whom she eventually reunites with. Koyomi&#x27;s mother possessed a Seikon mark, and Koyomi herself possesses a dormant form of Seikon allowing her to create a portal to Seiren after Miharu is kidnapped by Hijiri Kanata. After she loses in Fukuyama&#x27;s Cosplay Mahjong game, she is forced to wear nothing but a python, which she later ironically adopts as a pet.

: Tomoka is a resident of Seiren who is sent to aid Koyomi Hare Nanaka in finding Miharu&#x27;s older sister Maharu a groom after her less than productive efforts. Although a child, Tomoka deeply resents being treated as one and insists that she is as mature as anyone else, despite frequent actions by her which prove otherwise. She gets along fairly well with Fukuyama, whom she later refers to as an older brother after the two team up to obtain some mutual objective. She has developed a small crush on him but it is not something he is aware of. Tomoka can also use transformation magic. In the anime adaptation, Tomoka frequently uses Ebi as a makeshift club for hitting almost anything and anyone; she becomes friends with Lisa after conceding defeat in a magical duel. She is also obsessed with Poyon, her favorite TV show character. Because she is a child, Tomoka is able to have contact with Yukinari without triggering his female allergy. She also looks up to Kirie as an older sister. For example, she follows Kirie&#x27;s example of drop-kicking Fukuyama right in the face. Tomoka is later revealed to be a genius capable of instantly answering a complex math equation from a college entrance exam.


In the Mahjong episode, Voiced by Fumihiko Tachiki (Japanese); Dameon Clarke (English)
: Ebi is a creature from Seiren that resembles a plump miniature seal with the face of a cat and a pair of large bobbing antenna, which causes Miharu to claim she resembles a shrimp (&quot;ebi&quot; is the Japanese word for shrimp). She is accidentally summoned by Miharu during a bath, and becomes a pet for Miharu and the girls. In the anime adaptation, Tomoka pulls her out of her bag. She suffers a great deal of torment at the hands of Tomoka, who uses her as a club, flail, fishing bait, or handball. When Tomoka transforms Ebi into a girl for a brief amount of time, Yukinari and Kirie pay more attention to the transformed Ebi than to her. In the anime episode where the gang play Mahjong, Ebi is able to think through the entire play in her mind but is unable to communicate the move to novice Tomoka, rendering her plan fruitless. Also in the anime, Ebi can shoot a powerful beam attack called the E-beam from her mouth although it takes a while to recharge.

===Supporting===
: Maharu is Miharu&#x27;s well-endowed older sister. She is very determined and will not hesitate to use violence to get her way. Although initially jealous of Miharu&#x27;s relationship with Yukinari Sasaki, she eventually gives them her blessing. Much to Yukinari&#x27;s dismay, that does not stop her from flirting and fondling him whenever she gets a chance. Due to Seiren&#x27;s low male population and the fact that she is close to 30, Maharu assigns both Koyomi and Tomoka to find a man of her own on Earth. Though flirtatious, she is, in fact, quite picky by Seiren standards, rejecting Kazuharu Fukuyama immediately upon discovering his perverted nature. In the epilogue for the anime adaptation, she proposes to Hayate. Despite proposing to him, getting married in the manga, and giving Yukinari and Miharu her blessing, she is still obsessed with Yukinari, loves him, flirts with him, and wants to be with him. Maharu is voiced by Sayaka Ohara in Japanese and by Karen Thompson in English. Kotono Mitsuishi provides her voice for the Drama CDs.
: Lilica is the Fukuyamas&#x27; chief maid. She is stoic and polite, even when Kirie destroys some expensive equipment. However, she shows shock when Kirie and Yukinari introduce themselves as Fukuyama&#x27;s friends. She later reveals that she has fought in military operations in Bosnia, Somalia, Chechnya, and Afghanistan. She is highly intelligent and is sometimes seen with a laptop which operates mechanical devices within the Fukuyama mansion, and also a spy satellite, which explains how Kazuharu Fukuyama constantly finds Koyomi and the others. In the anime adaptation, Lilica places Mamoru Machida as an apprentice after being impressed by his desire to clean the world. She is also occasionally hinted to be in love with Fukuyama. Lilica is voiced by Natsuko Kuwatani in Japanese and by Wendy Tomson in English.
: Hayate is one of Lisa Fukuyama&#x27;s attendants. While he only makes a handful of appearances in the manga, Hayate in the anime forms a strong rivalry/friendship with Tomoka, and the two occasionally battle one another in friendly duels. Hayate is a very calm, loyal, and serious individual who will go to great lengths for his mistress, Lisa; this usually involves doing some sort of research or private investigating. Tomoka nicknames him &quot;ninja&quot; because of his stealthy ways, only revealing himself when attending to Lisa, or to attack. Hayate is voiced by Takanori Hoshino in Japanese and by Patrick Seitz in English.
: Kosame is Lisa Fukuyama&#x27;s second attendant. In the anime adaptation, Kosame is also a considerably stronger fighter than Kirie Kojima, and after fighting with Kirie, she falls in love with her. Her obsession is so strong that just being in Kirie&#x27;s presence is enough to make Kosame either grope or make some other pass at her, which usually requires Hayate to rein her in. When not fawning over Kirie, Kosame is as stoic a figure as Hayate and frequently uses her gun to either pry information out of others or to force them into doing her bidding. Kosame is voiced by Nozomi Masu in Japanese and by Robin Rhodpa in English.
: Nanae is Koyomi and Tomoka&#x27;s superior in the Space Travel Agency. Nanae is in charge of the missing persons department and assigns agents to find and retrieve residents of Seiren who have accidentally been transported to Earth. In the anime adaptation, she helps Maharu Sena Kanaka contact Yukinari so that the others can rescue Miharu. Nanae is voiced by Yukiko Iwai in Japanese and by Rita Stevens in English.
:Mamoru is an obsessive-compulsive classmate of Yukinari Sasaki&#x27;s. He dons an alter-ego, Lightning Squadron Mamo Ranger - a parody of the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series - in the pursuit of his passion for cleaning and pointing out litterbugs, although at first glance his &#x27;squadron&#x27; consists of only him. Extremely accident prone, he tends to cause more problems than he solves, whereupon his deluded sense of reality causes him to blame his &quot;villainous opponents.&quot; He later drafts the others into the Mamo Rangers, although they want absolutely nothing to do with it. In the anime adaptation, Mamoru becomes an apprentice to Lilica which turns him from a mild annoyance into a serious threat to public safety. Mamoru is voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino in Japanese and by Sam Regal in English.
: Hijiri is a strict guidance counselor who joins Yukinari&#x27;s high school. In the anime adaptation, she serves as a subordinate for Yukina, whose mission is to observe and eventually kidnap Miharu. Hijiri had been obsessed with Miharu since they were both children, and Yukina promises to give Miharu to her in exchange for helping her achieve her goals. However, Hijiri is eventually defeated by Kirie, and forgets about Miharu and begins to obsess over Kirie instead. Hijiri is voiced by Aya Hisakawa in Japanese and by Erica Shaffer in English.

;Mrs. Sasaki
:Mrs. Sasaki is Yukinari Sasaki&#x27;s mother. As Yukinari keeps Miharu Sena Kanaka a secret from her, Mrs. Sasaki begins to fear that the strange occurrences in her house were due to a ghost, but eventually decides not to worry about it since all the &quot;ghost&quot; did was eat all the food. She later leaves Yukinari to be with his father, who is on a business trip.

; Vegetable Store Keeper
: A local grocer who befriends Miharu at the start of the series, and gives her the nickname Banana Girl. He is voiced by Takashi Nagasako in Japanese and by Doug Stone in English.
: A character exclusive to the anime adaptation, The Boss is an overweight and soft-spoken thug dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and is usually accompanied by an exuberant man in a blue leisure suit. The thugs cross pass Yukinari Sasaki and his friends throughout the series. However, after Miharu Sena Kanaka is kidnapped by Hijiri Kanata, the Boss helps Yukinari realize that the only way to get Miharu back is to fight for her with everything he has got. When his friend later asks why he never spoke before, the Boss tells him that he simply never had anything to say. The Boss is voiced by Toshihide Tsuchiya in Japanese and by J.C. Miller in English.
: A ghost who has been haunting the Fukuyamas&#x27; private hot spring. Last winter, she was bathing at the spring when a pervert caught and groped her. When she tried to catch him, she slipped on a wet rock, hit her head and died. In order to move on to the afterlife, she wants to catch a pervert. Lisa suggests they re-enact the scene, and volunteers Yukinari and herself, although Hakana accidentally possesses Kirie instead. When Kirie tries to resist the groping, Hakana realizes that Kirie likes Yukinari. When Kirie and Yukinari hug, Hakana is freed; she thanks the group and tells Kirie what a wonderful person Yukinari is. She is voiced by Ai Shimizu in Japanese and by Tara Platt in English.
: A character exclusive to the anime adaptation, Yukina is the ruthless leader of the Space Management Bureau&#x27;s Special Forces Division in Seiren, who also has the power of Seikon. Because of her slight build and Seikon markings covering her body, Yukina felt that no man would ever love her and developed a condition that causes her to break out in hives upon contact with men. Her illness and anti-masculine prejudices are what cause Yukina to decide that if she cannot be loved by men then no one in Seiren can. Eventually, Yukina has her subordinate Hijiri Kanata send Miharu Sena Kanaka back to Seiren to permanently seal the gateway to Earth using her power, making Seiren a &quot;woman-only paradise&quot;. But after being shown kindness by Yukinari Sasaki, Yukina falls in love with him and releases Miharu. Yukina is voiced by Sakura Nogawa in Japanese and by Elise Baughman in English.

===Video game===
Kadokawa Shoten published a video game based on the series for the PlayStation 2 in 2005, entitled . The game received a CERO rating of &quot;15 up&quot;.

==Reception==
Chris Johnston of &quot;Newtype USA&quot; comments that &quot;The 17+ rating is well-earned,&quot; and that &quot;The raunchy, raucous humor is definitely not for young ones.&quot;
Carlo Santos of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; writes &quot;Girls Bravo has moments of promise as a screwball comedy, but as a whole, it falls victim to the same flaws of every other harem anime.&quot;
&quot;Mania&quot; reviewer Chris Beveridge wrote &quot;Though Girls Bravo does dip into some of the traditional elements of the harem anime design, it&#x27;s naughtier and slightly raunchier take along is a welcome change for a lot of it.&quot;
In his review Stig Høgset of &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; wrote that &quot;Characters get kicked, kneed in the face, stomped on and god knows what else&quot; and that &quot;the show is THICK with fan service that, while censored in the fansubs, might be VERY explicit in any potential future release.&quot;

<doc id="1270739" wikidata="Q7080380" url="?curid=1270739" title="Oh, No! It's Devo">
<text>Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo is the fifth studio album by American new wave band Devo, released in 1982 by Warner Bros. Records. The album was recorded over a period of four months, between May and September 1982, at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and was produced by Roy Thomas Baker.

==Background==
&quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot; features an even greater reliance on programmed synthesizers and drum machines than its predecessor, &quot;New Traditionalists&quot; (1981). DJ Pangburn of Reverb.com noted that these elements, &quot;combined with the minimal use of guitars, gives the record a metronomic, roboticized feel.&quot; 

According to a 1982 interview with lead vocalist Mark Mothersbaugh, the album was titled &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot; because &quot;there are many people out there who, when they hear we&#x27;re around again or have one more album coming out, that is their reaction.&quot; In later interviews, Devo&#x27;s co-founder and bass guitarist Gerald Casale stated that the album was born out of critical reviews in which the band were alternately described as both &quot;fascists&quot; and &quot;clowns&quot;. In response, the band decided to make an album that would answer the question, &quot;what would a record by fascist clowns sound like?&quot;

The song &quot;I Desire&quot; brought the band controversy, as the lyrics were taken directly from a poem written by John Hinckley, Jr., who had attempted to assassinate U.S. President Ronald Reagan in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster. The band had first read the poem in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and thought it was &quot;pretty great&quot;, despite the source. Casale later said that Hinckley was &quot;quite proud&quot; of the song, but &quot;completely didn&#x27;t understand that what we did was invert it. We knew how nuts he was, of course, and the third verse I added clearly turns the mirror on the psycho.&quot; While Foster gave the band her blessing to use the lyrics, the FBI issued them several warnings. &quot;Big Mess&quot; was inspired by letters sent to a game show host by someone using the name &quot;Cowboy Kim&quot;.

Devo took on another new look for this album, wearing black T-shirts and slacks with white &quot;Spud Ring&quot; collars. In concert, these were augmented with &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; (1980) era energy domes and &quot;New Traditionalists&quot; era shirts and ascots for part of the performance. The LP jacket had a cutout stand on the back so it could be stood up like a picture frame.

==Promotion==
Devo supported the album with a North American tour.

The band also produced three music videos for the album: &quot;Time Out for Fun,&quot; &quot;Peek-a-Boo!&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Good&quot;. All three videos eschewed Devo&#x27;s previous narrative style for a basic performance against a bluescreen background displaying related visuals to the song. These were intended to replicate the band&#x27;s intentions for the forthcoming tour for those who would be unable to attend. The video for &quot;That&#x27;s Good&quot; ran into censorship troubles on MTV, as the juxtaposition of a cartoon french fry penetrating the hole of a doughnut and quickly cutting to a writhing, smiling nude woman, shot from the neck up, was considered too risqué for airplay. Band member and video director Gerald Casale later elaborated in an interview for the 33⅓ series book &quot;Devo&#x27;s Freedom of Choice&quot; in 2015:
&quot;We got this call from [MTV co-founder] Les Garland, He was like, &#x27;Look, we know what you&#x27;re trying to do here.&#x27; I go, What do you mean? He goes, &#x27;Ya know, when that cartoon French fry glides through that cartoon donut and then it&#x27;s with the girl looking happy. You can have the French fry, or you can have the donut, but you can&#x27;t have the French fry and the donut, Otherwise, you can&#x27;t cut to the girl.&#x27; And I go, &#x27;But what about when the French fry hits the donut and breaks in half and she&#x27;s sad?&#x27; And he goes &#x27;Alright you little smart ass.&#x27; It was horrible. Then I go, &#x27;What about that Billy Idol video you have and the girls are in skin-tight pants and their asses are full on in the screen and his head is between her legs and then somebody slaps her ass? What about that?&#x27; He goes, &#x27;we&#x27;re talking about you, we&#x27;re not talking about them.&quot;
Casale eventually relented and made significant cuts to the video, which he came to regret, as &quot;the song was going down in the charts, not up.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Debby Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; observed that &quot;Devo again proves to be at their best with a singular brand of dance song—sort of a Chubby Checker-in-space idea, with loony instructions set to a mechanized stomp.&quot; However, she cited &quot;Peek-a-Boo!&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Good&quot; as the album&#x27;s sole highlights, adding, &quot;it&#x27;s getting harder to take the whole Devo package—the dumbbell retrograde-evolution philosophy and all the promotional merchandise. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; felt the album was &quot;pointlessly produced by Roy Thomas Baker&quot; and &quot;failed to slow the creative slide.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; determined that the band and Baker captured &quot;a full and satisfying sound without losing the spastic mechanical repetitiveness for which Devo is known.&quot;

In retrospective reviews, Steve Huey of AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s &quot;quality singles&quot; but felt that Baker&#x27;s production &quot;smooths out any remaining edges in the band&#x27;s sound&quot;, noting its &quot;colder-sounding digital synths&quot; and &quot;thudding electronic percussion, which contributes heavily to the album&#x27;s overall feeling of bloodlessness&quot;. The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; deemed &quot;That&#x27;s Good&quot; and &quot;Big Mess&quot; &quot;Devo at its most pointed and charming.&quot;

==Tour==

Devo&#x27;s tour for the album was an innovative set up performed against a 12-foot, rear-projected video. Animated videos were produced for most of the songs, synchronised to the music. For several songs, the band appeared to interact with the visuals, such as being kicked down by a giant pirate at the end of &quot;Peek-a-Boo!&quot;, or shooting icons of unsynchronized dancing girls in &quot;Out of Sync.&quot;

Later in the setlist, the screen would be removed to reveal Devo lit by moving lighting effects (Panaspots provided by Morpheus Lights). The &quot;Oh, No! It&#x27;s Devo&quot; tour was the second concert tour known to utilize computerized moving lights, about one year after Genesis used 50 Vari-Lites (VL1&#x27;s) on their Abacab tour.

The first show of the tour took place on October 30, 1982, at the Warner Beverly Hills Theater in Beverly Hills, California, and featured Wall of Voodoo as the opening act. It was filmed and transmitted live in 3-D to college campuses around the country, billed as &quot;3-DEVO&quot;. This first performance was marred by technical mishaps: the backing track went out of sync during &quot;Speed Racer,&quot; forcing the band to abandon the following performance of &quot;Big Mess&quot;; Mark Mothersbaugh&#x27;s microphone cut out during &quot;Out of Sync&quot; and he was forced to perform the rest of the first set with guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh&#x27;s microphone. In the second half of the show, the 3-D effects were ineffective and the band attacked the company providing the video twice: once during &quot;Jocko Homo,&quot; with a series of cheap 3-D tricks (mostly snake nut cans) by Mothersbaugh; and once in a rant during &quot;Beautiful World,&quot; delivered by the character Booji Boy. This concert was the only known live performance of &quot;Explosions&quot;, which was cut from the rest the tour for unknown reasons.

The &quot;3-DEVO&quot; concert was later rebroadcast in a heavily edited version, omitting the technical gaffes and critical remarks. Both versions are available as bootlegs and several audio recordings of the tour exist in varying quality.

<doc id="1270750" wikidata="Q1291044" url="?curid=1270750" title="1996 United States campaign finance controversy">
<text>The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy, sometimes referred to as Chinagate, was an effort by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to influence domestic American politics prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.

While questions regarding the U.S. Democratic Party&#x27;s fundraising activities first arose over a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article published on September 21, 1996, China&#x27;s role in the affair first gained public attention when Bob Woodward and Brian Duffy of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a story stating that a United States Department of Justice investigation into the fundraising activities had uncovered evidence that agents of China sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The journalists wrote that intelligence information had shown the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC in violation of United States law forbidding non-American citizens or non-permanent residents from giving monetary donations to United States politicians and political parties. A Republican investigator of the controversy stated that the Chinese plan targeted both presidential and congressional United States elections, while Democratic senators said the evidence showed the Chinese targeted only congressional elections. The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China denied all accusations.

== Background ==
According to the U.S. Senate report, Chinese officials eventually developed a set of proposals to promote their interests with the United States government and to improve China&#x27;s image with the American people. The proposals, dubbed the &quot;China Plan&quot;, were prompted by the United States Congress&#x27;s successful lobbying of President Bill Clinton to grant a visa to Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had previously assured his Chinese counterpart Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that granting a visa would be &quot;inconsistent with [the United States&#x27;] unofficial relationship [with Taiwan]&quot; and the Clinton Administration&#x27;s acquiescence to the Congressional resolutions led China to conclude that the influence of Congress over foreign policy was more significant than it had previously determined. When formulating the so-called plan, Chinese officials acknowledged that, compared to other countries, it had little knowledge of, or influence over, policy decisions made in Congress, which had a sizeable pro-Taiwan faction under the influence of a more established &quot;China Lobby&quot; run by the Kuomintang. The plan, according to the Senate report, instructed Chinese officials in the U.S. to improve their knowledge about members of Congress and increase contacts with its members, the public, and the media. The plan also suggested ways to lobby United States officials.

Over the years, China repeatedly denied that their lobbying efforts involved financial contributions of any kind, e.g., stating &quot;some people and media in the United States speculated... about so-called participation by Chinese individuals in political donations during the U.S. elections. It is sheer fabrication and is intended to slander China. [China] has never, nor will we ever, use money to influence American politics&quot;—a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, May 1998.

== Major fund-raising figures ==
=== Yah-Lin &quot;Charlie&quot; Trie ===
The most significant activity by Yah-Lin &quot;Charlie&quot; Trie (崔亞琳) was a $450,000 attempted donation from him to Clinton&#x27;s legal defense fund (for his impeachment trials) which Trie allegedly delivered in two envelopes each containing several checks and money orders. The fund immediately rejected $70,000 and deposited the remainder, but ordered an investigation of the source. The investigation found that some of the money orders were made out in different names but with the same handwriting, and sequentially numbered. The fund then rejected the donation entirely, and allegedly returned the deposited funds two months after the initial contribution.

Born in Taiwan, Trie emigrated to the U.S. in 1974. He eventually became an American citizen and co-owner of a restaurant in Little Rock, Arkansas. The 1997 special investigation describes Trie as having attempted to develop an international trading business (Daihatsu International Trading Corporation), having maintained or accessed accounts in Little Rock and Washington, D.C., into which Macau-based real estate businessman Ng Lap Seng wired &gt;$1M USD from Macau and Hong Kong accounts, and as having never succeeded in the trading business (based on bank and tax records indicating substantive income only from Ng).

In Little Rock, Trie befriended Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas. In addition to the attempted donation to Clinton&#x27;s defense fund, Trie and his immediate family donated $220,000 to the DNC which was also later returned. Immediately after the donation to Clinton&#x27;s defense fund, Trie sent a letter to President Clinton that expressed concern about America&#x27;s intervention in tensions arising from China&#x27;s military exercises being conducted near Taiwan. Trie told the President in his letter that war with China was a possibility should U.S. intervention continue:
After Congressional investigations turned to Trie in late 1996, he left the country for China. Trie returned to the U.S. in 1998 and was convicted and sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and four months&#x27; home detention for violating federal campaign finance laws by making political contributions in someone else&#x27;s name and for causing a false statement to be made to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

=== Johnny Chung ===
Born in Taiwan, Johnny Chung went from being the owner of a &quot;blastfaxing&quot; business (an automated system that quickly sends out faxes to thousands of businesses) in California to being in the middle of the Washington, D.C. elite within a couple weeks of his first donations to the Democratic Party. Called a &quot;hustler&quot; by a U.S. National Security Council (NSC) aide, Chung made forty-nine separate visits to the White House between February 1994 and February 1996. One of his purposes in making these trips was to obtain photographs of himself with the Clintons, which he believed would help him to get business in China by giving people the impression that he had connections and influence in Washington—he used a brochure that included at least ten photographs of himself with Hillary Clinton along with a personal note from her. During one of the U.S. Commerce Department trade missions to China, Chung befriended former Chinese Lt. Col. Liu Chaoying, then an executive at China Aerospace International Holdings (中國航天國際控股有限公司), which is the Hong Kong-based subsidiary of the government-controlled CASC (中國航天科技集團公司), China&#x27;s premier satellite launching company. She is the daughter of former General Liu Huaqing.

Between 1994 and 1996, Chung donated $366,000 to the DNC. Once the truth of this situation was revealed to the public, all of the money was allegedly returned. Chung told federal investigators that $35,000 of the money he donated came from Liu Chaoying and, in turn, China&#x27;s military intelligence.

Specifically, Chung testified under oath to the U.S. House Committee investigating the issue in May 1999 that he was introduced to Chinese Gen. Ji Shengde, then the head of Chinese military intelligence, by Liu Chaoying. Chung said that Ji told him: &quot;We like your president very much. We would like to see him reelect. I will give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You can give it to the president and the Democrat Party.&quot; Both Liu and the Chinese government denied the claims.

Chung was eventually sentenced to five years&#x27; probation and community service following an agreement to plea guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion, and two misdemeanor counts of conspiring to violate election law.

=== John Huang and James Riady ===

John Huang (pronounced &quot;Hwa[ng]&quot;), was another major figure convicted. Born in 1945 in Nanping, Fujian, Huang and his father fled to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War before he eventually emigrated to the United States in 1969. A former employee of the Indonesian company Lippo Group&#x27;s Lippo Bank and its owners Mochtar Riady and his son James (whom Huang first met along with Bill Clinton at a financial seminar in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1980), Huang became a key fund-raiser within the DNC in 1995. While there, he raised $3.4 million for the party. Nearly half had to be returned when questions arose regarding their source during later investigations by Congress.

According to U.S. Secret Service logs, Huang visited the White House 78 times while working as a DNC fund-raiser. James Riady visited the White House 20 times (including six personal visits to President Clinton).

Immediately prior to joining the DNC, Huang worked in President Clinton&#x27;s Commerce Department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic affairs. His position made him responsible for Asia-U.S. trade matters. He was appointed to the position by President Clinton in December 1993. His position at the Commerce Department gave him access to classified intelligence on China. While at the department, it was later learned, Huang met 9 times with Chinese embassy officials.

Huang eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to reimburse Lippo Group employees&#x27; campaign contributions with corporate or foreign funds. James Riady was later convicted of campaign finance violations relating to the same scheme as well, and was sentenced to pay a large fine. Shortly after Riady pledged $1 million in support of then-Governor Clinton&#x27;s campaign for the presidency, contributions made by Huang had been reimbursed with funds wired from a foreign Lippo Group entity into an account Riady maintained at Lippo Bank and then distributed to Huang in cash. Also, contributions made by Lippo Group entities operating in the United States were reimbursed with wire transfers from foreign Lippo Group entities.

An unclassified U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs report issued in 1998 stated that both James Riady and his father Mochtar had &quot;had a long-term relationship with a Chinese intelligence agency.&quot; According to journalist Bob Woodward, details of the relationship came from highly classified intelligence information supplied to the committee by both the CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The most well-known of John Huang&#x27;s fund-raisers involved Vice President Al Gore, Maria Hsia, and the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple in California.

=== Maria Hsia ===
Taiwan-born Maria Hsia (pronounced &quot;Shya&quot;), a long time fund raiser for Al Gore, California immigration consultant, and business associate of John Huang and James Riady since 1988, facilitated $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions through her efforts at Hsi Lai Temple, a Chinese Buddhist temple associated with Taiwan in Hacienda Heights, California. This money went to the DNC, to the Clinton–Gore campaign, and to U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island. After a trial, Hsia was convicted in March 2000.

The Democratic National Committee eventually returned the money donated by the temple&#x27;s monks and nuns. Twelve nuns and employees of the temple, including temple abbess Venerable Yi Kung (who resigned her post after being subpoenaed), refused to answer questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment when they were subpoenaed to testify before Congress. Two other Buddhist nuns admitted destroying lists of donors and other documents related to the controversy because they felt the information would embarrass the temple. A Temple-commissioned videotape of the fund raiser also went missing and the nuns&#x27; attorney claimed it may have been shipped off to Taiwan.

The temple event became particularly controversial because it was attended by Vice President Gore. In an interview on the January 24, 1997, edition of the &quot;Today&quot; show, Gore said:


In response, the U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that investigated the controversy said:
John Huang&#x27;s memo to Vice President Gore&#x27;s assistant Kimberly Tilley specifically mentioned that the temple meeting was a fundraising event. Gore later acknowledged that he had known the visit was &quot;finance-related.&quot;
In the U.S., religious organizations enjoy a tax exempt status. Political activity is prohibited for such tax exempt entities.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also said they learned that Hsia had served as an &quot;agent&quot; of the PRC government. Hsia denied the claim.

=== Ted Sioeng ===
Ted Sioeng, an Indonesian entrepreneur who donated money to both Democrats and Republicans, was the sixth individual whose donations were investigated by the Senate committee. Suspect contributions associated with Sioeng include $250,000 to the DNC and $100,000 to Republican California State Treasurer Matt Fong. Fong returned the money in April 1997.

Sieong sat with Bill Clinton or Al Gore at two fundraising events. Sioeng also joined Fong at a meeting with then Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich in mid-1995. Gingrich called the meeting a &quot;photo op&quot;. Gingrich was the guest of honor at a Sioeng-organized luncheon the day after a Sioeng family company gave
the $50,000 think-tank donation, solicited by a Gingrich adviser.

Attorney General Janet Reno and the directors of the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency (NSA) told members of the Senate committee they had credible intelligence information indicating Sioeng acted on behalf of China. A spokesman for Sioeng denied the allegations. Sioeng left the country shortly thereafter, and no charges were filed.

=== Bernard Schwartz ===
Bernard L. Schwartz CEO of Loral Space &amp; Communications, a satellite communications company, donated over $600,000 to the Democratic Party. Schwartz said he did not expect, need, or receive any special treatment from the Clinton administration as a result of his donations. In 1998 Loral was under investigation for illegally transferring satellite technology to China.

In February 1998 during the time Loral was under investigation, Loral requested Clinton to sign a waiver which would allow Loral to ship satellite technology to China. Clinton&#x27;s justice department advised against signing the waiver because they believed that a jury wouldn&#x27;t convict Loral if they received a waiver from Clinton. Clinton did eventually sign the waiver. The U.S space technology received by China may have furthered Beijing&#x27;s military development of nuclear missiles. In 2002 Loral would later be fined $14 million for its involvement in illegally transferring classified secrets to China.

== Investigations ==
=== Department of Justice investigation ===
The Justice Department opened a task force in late 1996 to begin investigating allegations of campaign fundraising abuses by the Clinton/Gore re-election campaign. It expanded its internal investigation to include activities related to President Bill Clinton&#x27;s legal defense fund in December 1996.

President Clinton announced in February 1997 that he thought there should be a &quot;vigorous&quot; and &quot;thorough&quot; investigation into reports that the People&#x27;s Republic of China tried to direct financial contributions from overseas sources to the Democratic National Committee. The president stopped short of calling for an independent prosecutor, saying that was the decision of the Justice Department.

&quot;[O]bviously it would be a very serious matter for the United States if any country were to attempt to funnel funds to one of our parties for any reason whatever,&quot; President Clinton said.

By July 1997, the administration determined that no evidence of any such thing had yet been proven.

&quot;We have received the relevant [FBI] briefings,&quot; White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said. &quot;We believe there&#x27;s no basis for any change in our policy toward China, which is one of engagement.&quot;

&quot;I do not know whether it is true or not,&quot; President Clinton stated. &quot;Therefore, since I don&#x27;t know, it can&#x27;t... and shouldn&#x27;t affect the larger long-term strategic interests of the American people in our foreign policy.&quot;

Members of Congress of both parties reached disparate conclusions. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Senator Fred Thompson (a Republican from Tennessee) and chairman of the committee investigating the fundraising controversy, said he believed the Chinese plan targeted presidential and congressional elections while Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman and John Glenn said they believed the evidence showed the Chinese targeted only congressional elections.

=== Congressional investigations ===
With regard to their overall efficacy, investigators are on record as having stated that the Congressional investigations were hamstrung due to lack of co-operation of witnesses. Ninety-four people either refused to be questioned, pled the Fifth Amendment, or left the country altogether.
The U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs held public hearings into the campaign finance issues from July to October 1997. The Committee, chaired by Republican Fred Thompson, adopted a Republican-written final report (the Wikisource referenced and appearing herein) on a straight party-line vote, 8 in favor and 7 opposing, in March 1998. Thompson described the findings as &quot;not any one real big thing&quot; but &quot;a lot of things strung together that paint a real ugly picture.&quot; The Democrats published a minority report dissenting with most of the conclusions of the final report, stating the evidence &quot;does not support the conclusion that the China plan was aimed at, or affected, the 1996 presidential election.&quot; Considerable acrimony was displayed during the hearings between Thompson and the ranking minority member, Democrat John Glenn, with the public disagreements between the two leaders reaching a level seldom seen in recent years in Congressional committees.
A House investigation, headed by Indiana Republican Dan Burton focused on allegations of campaign finance abuse, including the contributions channeled through Chung, Huang, and Trie. The investigation was lengthy, spanning both the 105th and 106th Congresses, and according to a Democratic report had cost over $7.4 million as of August 31, 1998, making it the most expensive Congressional investigation ever (the Senate Watergate investigation cost $7 million in 1998 dollars).

Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute said in May 1998, &quot;Barring some dramatic change, I think the Burton investigation is going to be remembered as a case study in how not to do a congressional investigation and as a prime example of investigation as farce.&quot; In a May 5, 1998, letter to other Republicans on the committee, Burton admitted that &quot;mistakes and omissions were made&quot; in tape transcripts released to the public of phone calls made by Webster Hubbell. A committee investigator who was an advocate of releasing the tapes resigned at Burton&#x27;s request.

=== Calls for an independent counsel ===
President Clinton&#x27;s FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote in a 22-page memorandum to then Clinton&#x27;s critics called of the scandal, nicknamed &quot;Chinagate.&quot; Attorney General Janet Reno said in November 1997 that &quot;It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an independent counsel.&quot;

In July 1998, the Justice Department&#x27;s campaign finance task force head, Charles La Bella, sent a report to Janet Reno also recommending she seek an independent counsel to investigate alleged fundraising abuses by Democratic party officials. The media reported that La Bella believed there was clearly an appearance of a conflict of interest by Reno.

Robert Conrad, Jr., who later became head of the task force, called on Reno in Spring 2000 to appoint an independent counsel to look into the fundraising practices of Vice President Gore.

Janet Reno declined all requests:
A CNN/&quot;Time&quot; poll taken in May 1998 found 58 percent of Americans felt an independent counsel should have been appointed to investigate the controversy. Thirty-three percent were opposed. The same poll found that 47 percent of Americans believed a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; existed between the Clinton administration and the PRC government.

=== Calls for impeachment ===
In 1997 Bob Barr and eighteen other Republicans signed a resolution to impeach Bill Clinton for alleged campaign finance law violations and obstruction of congressional investigations. Anti Clinton activists collected 100,000 signatures supporting his impeachment.

=== Criticism of investigation ===
In addition to partisan complaints from Republicans, columnists Charles Krauthammer, William Safire, and Morton Kondracke, as well as a number of FBI agents, suggested the investigations into the fundraising controversies were willfully impeded.

FBI agent Ivian Smith wrote a letter to FBI Director Freeh that expressed &quot;a lack of confidence&quot; in the Justice Department&#x27;s attorneys regarding the fundraising investigation. He wrote: &quot;I am convinced the team at... [the Department of Justice] leading this investigation is, at best, simply not up to the task... The impression left is the emphasis on how not to prosecute matters, not how to aggressively conduct investigations leading to prosecutions.&quot; Smith and three other FBI agents later testified before Congress in late 1999 that Justice Department prosecutors impeded their inquiry. FBI agent Daniel Wehr told Congress that the first head U.S. attorney in the investigation, Laura Ingersoll, told the agents they should &quot;not pursue any matter related to solicitation of funds for access to the president. The reason given was, &#x27;That&#x27;s the way the American political process works.&#x27; I was scandalized by that,&quot; Wehr said. The four FBI agents also said that Ingersoll prevented them from executing search warrants to stop destruction of evidence and micromanaged the case beyond all reason.

FBI agents were also denied the opportunity to ask President Clinton and Vice President Gore questions during Justice Department interviews in 1997 and 1998 and were only allowed to take notes. During the interviews, neither Clinton nor Gore were asked any questions about fund-raisers John Huang and James Riady, nor the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple fundraising event led by Maria Hsia and attended by Huang and Ted Sioeng.

<text>Jalebi is a popular sweet snack in the Indian subcontinent, West Asia and some parts of Africa. It goes by many names, including jilapi, zelepi, jilebi, jilipi, zulbia, zoolbia, jerry, mushabak, z&#x27;labia, or zalabia.

The south Asian variety is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (in North India) along with optional other flavors such as kewra (scented water).

In some west Asian cuisines, jalebi may consist of a yeast dough fried and then dipped in a syrup of honey and rose water. The North African dish of &quot;Zalabia&quot; uses a different batter and a syrup of honey (Arabic: &quot;ʻasal&quot;) and rose water.

==History==

The earliest known recipe of this food comes from the 10th century in the Arabic cookbook &quot;Kitab al-Tabikh&quot; (English: The Book of Dishes) by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq. In the 13th century Persia, a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi mentioned a similar dish.

According to the Hobson-Jobson (1903) historical dictionary, the word &quot;jalebi&quot; is derived from the Arabic word zulabiya, or the Persian zolbiya.

&quot;Priyamkara-nrpa-katha&quot;, a work by the Jain author Jinasura, composed around 1450 CE, mentions jalebi in the context of a dinner held by a rich merchant. &quot;Gunyagunabodhini&quot;, another Sanskrit work dating before 1600 CE, lists the ingredients and recipe of the dish; these are identical to the ones used to prepare the modern jalebi. According to the Indian ambassador Nagma Malik, jalebi might have started life in Turkey and then arrived in Tunisia long ago before making its way to India. Others claim that it was created by a musician during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, Abdourrahman Ibnou Nafaâ Ziriab, who made a prolonged stop over in Tunisia while traveling from Baghdad to Andalusia.

It has been suggested that the American funnel cake is derived from the Arab and Persian cuisine, brought by German emigrants and called &quot;Drechterkuche&quot;.

== Regional varieties ==

=== Central Asia ===

==== Afghanistan ====
In Afghanistan, Jalebi is a popular dessert. There is some slight differences between Afghan Jalebi and other variants. The Afghan Jalebi does not use any food coloring in contrast to the Indian and Pakistani variants and so is usually yellow and not orange in color. The Afghan Jalebi is also thinner. It is a popular dessert that is commonly consumed in households and in public events such as weddings or festivals. Jalebi is oftentimes served with green tea. There is also a popular song from Bollywood film Phantom named Afghan Jaleb i.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
==== India ====
Jalebi made from khoya or mawa, was invented by Harprasad Badkul, in the year 1889, in Jabalpur.

In Norman Chevers book, &quot;A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India&quot; (1870, page 178) mentions &quot;jelabees&quot; as a historical way of poisoning prisoners in India in the 1800s.

==== Pakistan ====
In Pakistan, jalebis are a popular dessert that are commonly consumed in households and in public events such as weddings or festivals.

==== Nepal ====
In Nepal, it is known as &quot;Jerry,&quot; a word derived from Jangiri and the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. People usually eat &quot;Jerry&quot; with &quot;Swari&quot;, a very thin fried bread like Puri (food). It is often eaten in morning with Nepali Masala chiya.

=== Western Asia ===
==== Iran ====
It is known as (زولبیا) in Iran, although when translated into English, the spelling has alternatives and can include , , , , and others. In addition to being sweetened with honey and sugar, zoolbias in Iran is also flavoured with saffron or rose water. Often in Iran, zoolbia is served with Persian-style black tea alongside a similar dessert with a different &quot;egg&quot; shape, bamiyeh. These desserts are commonly served during Ramadan month as one of the main elements eaten after fasting.

In Iran, where it is known as &quot;zolbiya&quot;, the sweet was traditionally given to the poor during Ramadan. A 10th century cookbook gives several recipes for &quot;zulubiya&quot;. There are several surviving 13th century recipes for the sweetmeat, the most widely accepted being that mentioned in a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi.

==== Azerbaijan ====
&quot;Zulbiya&quot; or &quot;zilviya&quot; is one of the unique sweets of Ganja, one of the ancient cities of Azerbaijan. In the past, Zilviya was considered one of the main attributes of the Novruz in Ganja. Zilviya was usually cooked a few days before Novruz and served on the eve of the holiday. Just as each of the sweets and cookies placed on the table on the eve of holiday has a certain meaning in connection with Novruz, the round-shaped zilviyas, mostly baked in yellow and red, symbolized the equality of night and day on 21 March.

==== Arab countries ====

Zalābiya or zalabia, zalabiya (زلابية) (Maghrebi Arabic: زلابية) are found in the Levant and other Western Asian countries, including the Arab countries of Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.

These are fried dough foods, including types similar to doughnuts. Zalābiya are made from a batter composed of eggs, yeasted flour, and milk, and then cooked in oil. They are made by a zalbāni. Unlike &quot;jalebi&quot;, the Western Asian variety may have a different shape, more like a free-form doughnut or a ball (but this is depending on the exact region and culture), and it may contain cinnamon, lemon, and powdered sugar. In Yemen, the manner of preparing the &quot;zalabiyeh&quot; differed from the variety of &quot;jalebi&quot; made in the Indian sub-continent, insofar that the Indian variety was dipped in syrup, to give to it a glaze-like finish, whereas the Yemeni variety of &quot;zalabiyeh&quot; was &quot;made from a soft yeast bread [and] which is fried on both sides in deep oil. There are those who add to the dough black cumin for improved taste. They are eaten while they are still hot, while some have it as a practice to eat them with honey or with sugar.&quot;

&quot;Zalābiyeh&quot; is first mentioned in a 10th-century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, a book later translated by Nawal Nasrallah. Ernest A Hamwi, a Syrian immigrant to the United States, is believed to have used the Persian version &quot;zalabia&quot; as an early ice cream cone.

=== Africa ===
==== North Africa ====
&quot;Zlebia&quot; or &quot;zlabia&quot; is a type of pastry eaten in parts of Northwest Africa, such as Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. Natural ingredients include flour, yeast, yoghurt, and sugar or honey. This is then mixed with water and commonly two seeds of cardamom (oil for the crackling).

In Tunisia, the Zlabia is known to be a speciality of the city of Beja. In Algeria, the Zlabia of Boufarik, which is less greasy than the others and moderately sweet, is particularly successful.

==== Ethiopia ====
&quot;Mushabak&quot; or &quot;Mushabaka&quot; is a popular food mainly in the Oromo region. It comes in different shapes and sizes and is usually bathed with sugar syrup or honey. &quot;Mushabaka&quot; is normally baked red. It is often served at celebrations and other social events.

=== Mauritius ===
In Mauritius, jalebi are known as &quot;Gateau Moutaille&quot;; they are of Indian origin.

== Recipe variations (&quot;jalebi&quot; and &quot;zalabiyeh&quot;) ==
Zalābiya mushabbaka are latticed fritters made in discs, balls and squares. They are dipped in clarified honey perfumed with rose water, musk and camphor. A recipe from a caliph&#x27;s kitchen suggests milk, clarified butter, sugar and pepper to be added.

 is a &quot;sponge cake&quot; version cooked in a special round pot on a trivet and cooked in a &quot;tannur&quot;. They are often stick shaped. They are eaten year-round, including in expatriate communities such as in France, although they are especially popular during Ramadan celebrations.

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Jalebi Baby&quot; by Tesher: This song, which blends English and Punjabi lyrics, became a viral sensation globally, especially on platforms like TikTok. The song uses &quot;jalebi&quot; as a metaphor for something sweet and desirable. The collaboration with Jason Derulo further popularized the song, making it a crossover hit in both South Asian and Western markets.
* &quot;Jalebi Bai&quot; from the movie &quot;Double Dhamaal&quot;: This Bollywood song became a hit item number where &quot;jalebi&quot; is used metaphorically to describe an attractive and alluring woman. The song&#x27;s catchy tune and vibrant performance contributed to its widespread popularity in Indian cinema. 
* &quot;afghan jalebi&quot; from the movie &quot;Phantom&quot; This Bollywood song. 

== Controversy ==
* &quot;Jalebi&quot; - Jalebi was surrounded by controversy when the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, addressing an election rally in Haryana&#x27;s Gohana, showed a box of the famous jalebi-maker Matu Ram &#x27;halwai&#x27; and emphasised that his jalebi should be sold across the country. Jalebi is in parts of India, used as an unfair slur for Dravidian languages from the South, owing to the curvy and curly nature of the script.

<text>amNewYork Metro is a free daily newspaper that is published in New York City by Schneps Media. According to the company, the average Friday circulation in September 2013 was 335,900. When launched on October 10, 2003, it was the first free daily newspaper in New York City.

&quot;amNewYork Metro&quot; is primarily distributed in enclosed newspaper holders (&quot;honor boxes&quot;) located on sidewalks at street corners with high pedestrian traffic, and in racks in many major transportation hubs.

==History==
Boston-based free newspaper publisher Russel Pergament moved into New York City&#x27;s ultra-competitive newspaper market in the early 2000s, a move &quot;Time&quot; called &quot;admirable in its audacity&quot;, by focusing on the 18-to-34 segment of the population that traditionally did not read newspapers and wanted content that was &quot;fast, blather free and unbiased&quot; according to Pergament. He launched &quot;amNewYork&quot;, published by the Tribune Company, on October 10, 2003. When it launched, &quot;amNewYork&quot; was the first free daily newspaper in New York City.

amNewYork grew quickly to a circulation of 290,000 by May 2004. The launch of &quot;amNew York&quot; was part of a broader effort across the United States to revive the moribund newspaper industry after a decade of eroding readership and declining business.

amNewYork, along with &quot;Newsday&quot;, was sold by the Tribune Company to Cablevision in July 2008. amNewYork was acquired by Schneps Media in October 2019. and subsequently merged with &quot;Metro New York&quot; to become &quot;amNewYork Metro&quot; in January 2020.

<doc id="1270777" wikidata="Q4779520" url="?curid=1270777" title="The Peace War">
<text>The Peace War is a science fiction novel by American writer Vernor Vinge, about authoritarianism and technological progress. It was first published as a serial in &quot;Analog&quot; in 1984, and in book form shortly afterward. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1985. A sequel, &quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot;, was published in 1986. The two novels and &quot;The Ungoverned&quot;, a related novella, are collected in &quot;Across Realtime&quot; (Baen Books, 1991).

==Plot==
The story takes place in 2048, 51 years after scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory develop a force field-generating device they term the Bobbler. The Bobbler creates a perfectly spherical, reflective, impenetrable, and persistent shield around or through anything.

The bureaucracy running the Laboratory decide to use the Bobbler as a weapon. Declaring themselves the &quot;Peace Authority&quot;, they enclose the world&#x27;s weapons and military bases in bobbles, and occasionally entire cities or governments. A brief war is triggered but ends quickly as the military is cut off from command, their weapons, and each other. It is presumed that the people within the bobbles die due to a lack of air and sunlight, since it is believed that the universe is partitioned by a bobble into two sections (inside and outside the bobble). In this new world, governments are weak where they are permitted at all; the Peace Authority seizes control and becomes a worldwide government. In an effort to retain their monopoly on the Bobbler, the Peace Authority makes technological progress illegal and returns the planet to a level similar to that of the 19th century.

The story opens with the crew of a military spaceplane emerging from their bobble and being picked up by a group of Tinkers. The Tinkers are a rebel group who have continued to secretly develop technology to a point well beyond what the Authority allows. Their emergence reveals two previously unknown facts about bobbles: one is that they are not force fields, but rather stasis fields inside which no time elapses, and the second is that they do not last forever, but will eventually &quot;pop&quot; at a time that is not initially determinable by the operators of the Bobbler. The bobble around the spaceplane is the first one known to pop; it is eventually found that the first bobbles last roughly fifty years.

One of the original inventors of the bobble helped form the Tinkers. He develops a more advanced version of the bobbler which can produce bobbles of any size, unlike the Authority&#x27;s original which is at least house-sized and requires a huge amount of power to run. They also find that they can set the duration of a bobble. Using their new device, they learn that one cannot form a bobble around another. This provides a defence; one can carry a small bobble (in a pocket, for instance), making it impossible for the Peace Authority to bobble that person. With the help of a young thief and mathematical genius, they lead a rebellion to try to bobble the power generators of the Peace Authority and thus neutralize its primary weapon.

<text>Arthur Leslie Lydiard (6 July 1917 – 11 December 2004) was a New Zealand runner and athletics coach. He has been lauded as one of the outstanding athletics coaches of all time and is credited with popularising the sport of running and making it commonplace across the sporting world. His training methods are based on a strong endurance base and periodisation.

==Biography==

Lydiard was born in Auckland, growing up in Sandringham. He attended Edendale School and Mount Albert Grammar School. He spent much of his early life training to become a shoemaker. After noticing that his physical fitness was waning in his 20s, Lydiard set up the Owairaka Harriers, becoming the coach of the Owairaka Athletic Club.

Lydiard competed in the Men&#x27;s Marathon at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, coming twelfth with a time of 2:54:51.

Lydiard presided over New Zealand&#x27;s golden era in world track and field during the 1960s sending Murray Halberg, Peter Snell and Barry Magee to the podium at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Under Lydiard&#x27;s tutelage Snell went on to double-gold at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Notable athletes subsequently coached by him or influenced by his coaching methods included Rod Dixon, John Walker, Dick Quax and Dick Tayler.

In the 1962 New Year Honours, Lydiard was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to sport. On 6 February 1990, Lydiard was the 17th appointee to the Order of New Zealand, New Zealand&#x27;s highest civil honour. He also became a life member of Athletics New Zealand in 2003.

Arthur Lydiard died 11 December 2004 of a suspected heart attack in Texas, while on a lecture tour.

==Training philosophy==

Lydiard&#x27;s ground-breaking impact on distance running was recognised by &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot;, which hailed him as &quot;All time best running coach&quot;.

Lydiard constantly clashed with unimaginative and officious athletics administrators in his native New Zealand and in the countries that called upon his strong personality and coaching expertise to establish national athletics programmes.

The marathon-conditioning phase of Lydiard&#x27;s system is known as base training, as it creates the foundation for all subsequent training. Lydiard&#x27;s emphasis on an endurance base for his athletes, combined with his introduction of periodisation in the training of distance runners, were the decisive elements in the world-beating success of the athletes he coached or influenced. All of the training elements were already there in the training of Roger Bannister, the first miler who broke the 4-minute barrier for the mile, but Lydiard increased distance and intensity of training and directed the sport periodisation towards the Olympics and not the breaking of records.

Periodisation comprises emphasising different aspects of training in successive phases as an athlete approaches an intended target race. After the base training phase, Lydiard advocated four to six weeks of strength work. This included hill running and springing. This improved running economy under maximal anaerobic conditions without the strain on the achilles tendon, as it was still done in running shoes. Only after this spikes were put on and a maximum of four weeks of anaerobic training followed. (Lydiard found through physiological testing that four weeks was the maximum amount of anaerobic development needed—any more caused negative effects such a decrease in aerobic enzymes and increased mental stress, often referred to as burnout, due to lowered blood pH.) Then followed a co-ordination phase of six weeks in which anaerobic work and volume taper off and the athlete races each week, learning from each race to fine-tune himself or herself for the target race. For Lydiard&#x27;s greatest athletes the target race was invariably an Olympic final.

Lydiard was renowned for his uncanny knack of ensuring that his athletes peaked for their most important races and, apart from his tremendous charisma and extraordinary ability to inspire and motivate athletes, this was largely a product of the periodisation principle he introduced into running training.

In the base training phase of his system Lydiard insisted, dogmatically, that his athletes—not least 800 metres athlete Peter Snell—must train 100 miles (160 km) a week. He was completely inflexible on this requirement. In the 1950s and 1960s, during the base phase of their training the athletes under Lydiard&#x27;s tutelage would run a 35 km Sunday training route, starting from his famed 5 Wainwright Avenue address in Mt Roskill, through steep and winding roads in the Waitakere mountain ranges. The total cumulative ascent in the Waitakeres was over 500 metres. After laying such an arduous endurance base Lydiard&#x27;s athletes—including Murray Halberg, Peter Snell, Barry Magee and John Davies—were ready to challenge the world, winning six Olympic medals amongst them in the 1960 Rome Olympics and the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Snell, who after retiring from athletics in the mid-1960s went on to obtain a PhD in exercise physiology, stated in his autobiography &quot;No Bugles No Drums&quot; that the marathon-conditioning endurance aspect of Lydiard&#x27;s training was the primary factor in his success as a world-beating middle-distance athlete.

The Lydiard system has been challenged since it was formalised and crystallised in the early 1960s. The two main sources of criticism of Lydiard emanate from the English coach, Frank Horwill, and the US coach, Jack Daniels. Horwill&#x27;s Five Tier Training system departs from Lydiard in its claim that the maximum amount of weekly mileage that an athlete requires to achieve maximum aerobic efficiency is 110 km.

Horwill takes the view that Lydiard&#x27;s insistence on 160 km a week in the base phase is at best superfluous, at worst an unnecessary cause of injuries and staleness. Horwill also differs from Lydiard in that he believes that all aspects of training must be present in a training programme at any time of the year and periodisation is a matter of simply emphasising one aspect of training such as speed or strength during a particular phase in which all the other training components are present.

Daniels, on the other hand, emphasises the need to train at what he terms &quot;threshold pace&quot; in order to achieve optimum athletic performance. He believes that the Lydiard system ignores training at such intermediate paces between the extremes of long, slow, distance running and fast, anaerobic, track work.

==Legacy==

Nearly every successful athletics coach or athlete active in the world today consciously or unconsciously emulates Lydiard&#x27;s training system by laying an endurance base and making use of periodisation for peak performance. While the direct influence Lydiard exerted on the East African athletes is a matter for debate, what is indisputable is that the Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes do significant amounts of endurance work and make use of periodisation.

Efforts have been made across the world to preserve and promote the training and coaching legacy left by Lydiard. In his native New Zealand, the Legend marathon, which follows the famous training route followed by Lydiard&#x27;s greatest athletes over the Waitekere Ranges west of Auckland, was established in his memory by Zimbabwean-born Ian Winson. In the United States, where Lydiard&#x27;s ideas gained most currency worldwide, the Lydiard Foundation was established by two Lydiard disciples, Nobby Hashizume and New Zealand 1992 Olympic women&#x27;s marathon bronze medalist Lorraine Moller, to promote Lydiard&#x27;s training philosophy. In Johannesburg, South Africa, one of the few athletics clubs in the world to be named after a coach, the Lydiard Athletics Club, was founded in 2009 to promote Lydiard&#x27;s training methodology and promote running as a way of life amongst youth.

As recently as 2009, Lydiard&#x27;s training methods were also credited as the catalyst for the qualification of an unprecedented three South African male athletes, Juan Van Deventer, Pieter Van Der Westhuizen and Johan Cronje, for the 1500 metres for the 2009 Track and Field Championships in Berlin.

Rangiora High School has a house named after Lydiard. Lydiard Place, in the Hamilton suburb of Chartwell, is also named in Lydiard&#x27;s honour.

==Time in Finland==

While the work he did in the late 1960s in Finland is generally acknowledged to have led to the renaissance in Finnish distance running in the 1970s (with Pekka Vasala winning gold in the 1500 metres at the 1972 Munich Olympics and Lasse Virén winning gold in both the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres at the 1972 Olympics and the 1976 Montreal Olympics), his coaching experiences in Mexico and Venezuela were less successful. Lydiard was forced to leave both countries because of what he perceived as a lack of support for his coaching efforts and the needs of athletes there.

In total, Arthur Lydiard&#x27;s stay in Finland, following the Finnish Track &amp; Field Association invitation, lasted only 19 months, but had long-lasting effects.

Before his arrival, interval training had been, unsuccessfully, the cornerstone of the Finnish training during the 1960s. Due to this background and the Finns&#x27; reluctance to change, his stay initially created mixed reviews.

However, most importantly, the new training methods were picked up by the trainers of Pekka Vasala, and Lasse Virén&#x27;s coach Rolf Haikkola. Lydiard&#x27;s advice is often seen as complementary to those given at the time by Percy Cerutty, an Australian coach, Paavo Nurmi, the Flying Finn, and Mihály Iglói, a Hungarian coach.

The first signs of positive results from Lydiard&#x27;s visit came when Juha Väätäinen won the 5.000 and the 10.000 meters in the 1971 European Athletics Championships after blasting sprint finishes.

He was inducted into the Order of the White Rose of Finland for his efforts.

==Jogging==
Lydiard was a strong promoter of running for health, encouraging easy distance running for its cardiovascular health benefits at a time when people thought distance running was unhealthy and potentially dangerous. In 1961, with his group of followers, Lydiard organised the Auckland Jogging Club, a world first. During Bill Bowerman&#x27;s New Zealand visit with his world class 4×1 mile team, Lydiard organised Bowerman to go on a jog with one of his members, three time heart attack-recovered Andy Steedman. Bowerman in his fifties struggled to keep up with a man twenty years his senior, and following his return to America took jogging to Hayward Field and eventually the masses. Due in part to Bowerman&#x27;s wide influence, Lydiard&#x27;s competitive philosophies are sometimes conflated with jogging, including the myth of his promotion of &quot;long slow distance&quot; (&quot;LSD&quot;). However, in his updated training manual, &quot;Running the Lydiard Way&quot;, Lydiard explained that, even on long runs, his top athletes moved at healthy paces to become &quot;pleasantly tired.&quot;

<text>The Transmitter Solt () is a radio transmission facility for 540 kHz MW (Medium Wave) near Solt, Hungary, serving as the primary transmitter site for Kossuth Rádió. With an output power of 2000 kW (2 MW), it is the most powerful radio transmitter in Europe and is among the most powerful radio transmitters in the world. Its intended broadcast area covers the Hungarian-speaking territories of Central- and Eastern Europe, however successful reception of the Kossuth Rádió was reported from as far as Michigan, United States and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It uses a 303.6-metre tall guyed mast. The transmitter site (including all its original equipment) has been a preserved industrial monument since 2013.

== Location ==
Transmitter Solt is located in the Great Hungarian Plain, 4 km north from Solt and 80 km south from Budapest.

== History ==
By the early 1970s, interference from the increasing number of powerful MW transmitters across Europe rendered the Lakihegy Transmitter inadequate to provide the required coverage (covered approximately 50% of the territory of Hungary in 1972) so the Magyar Posta (Hungarian Post) and the central government decided to build a new transmitter with improved characteristics. The high priority project involved Hungarian, Polish and Soviet engineers from several companies and organizations. Construction works started in 1974, with several farmhouses and barns having been demolished on the intended site.

The transmitter was completed in 1977 and went on air the same year. It underwent a substantial renovation and equipment modernisation in 2017.

==Equipment==
The original 1977 transmitter was made of two identical, Soviet-made vacuum tube based 1000 kW units, combined for the required 2000 kW output power. It was replaced in 2017 by a solid state Nautel NX2000 consisting of five DRM-enabled NX400 units combined for 2000 kW output. The original vacuum tube transmitter (being a preserved industrial monument) remains on site as a functional backup unit.

<doc id="1270790" wikidata="Q7722269" url="?curid=1270790" title="The Cheaters (1945 film)">
<text>The Cheaters (1945), also known as MR. M. and the Pigeons, The Amazing MR. M., The Magnificent Mr. M. and The Magnificent Rogue, is a Christmas &quot;screwball comedy&quot; tale about a has-been actor invited to Christmas dinner by a rich family. The film was atypical of the Republic Pictures studio, directed by Joseph Kane and starring Joseph Schildkraut. The film was re-released in 1949 under a new title, The Castaway, and when the Republic film catalogue was sold in the 1950s as late night television fodder, it appeared consistently for years as a Christmas staple throughout the 1960s and 1970s.
==Plot==
New York City businessman James C. Pidgeon (Eugene Pallette) is on the verge of bankruptcy. His only hope is rich uncle Henry, who is on his deathbed. J.C.&#x27;s daughter Therese (Ruth Terry) persuades the rest of the family to take in a charity case for the holidays, not out of the goodness of her heart but to impress her upper-class boyfriend Stephen Bates (Robert Livingston) and his mother. From a newspaper list, they pick Anthony Marchand (Joseph Schildkraut), an actor injured in a car accident at the height of his career 10 years before, who is now a broken-down drunk.

J.C.&#x27;s son Reggie (David Holt) returns with bad news: Uncle Henry left his $5 million estate to Florie Watson (Ona Munson), a showgirl he had once seen perform as a child actress 30 years before in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. The will stipulates if Florie cannot be found within a reasonable amount of time, the estate goes to the Pidgeons. After bribing the sole executor, J.C. conspires to limit the search to just placing newspaper ads for a week without mentioning the inheritance. Furthermore, the executor believes the woman is in New York City, not Denver, where Uncle Henry died.

J.C. decides to look for Florie himself, so he can better keep the news from her. Marchand (awakening from an alcoholic binge) overhears the whole scheme and suggests he can probably find her easily through Actors&#x27; Equity. Reggie worries about a blackmail attempt, but Marchand makes a seemingly heartfelt speech about honor and his gratitude to the Pidgeons. He then eavesdrops and walks away without his customary limp, but is spotted by Angela (Anne Gillis), J.C.&#x27;s younger daughter. She lets him know that she is amused by his deception and he regains the limp.

Marchand and Willie Crawford (Raymond Walburn), J.C.&#x27;s freeloading brother-in-law, have little trouble locating Florie. Willie tells her that they are cousins and that the family wants her to spend the holidays with them. Florie recognizes Marchand&#x27;s name and confides to him, one trouper to another, that she knows she is not related to the Pidgeons, but as she is broke and behind on her rent, she is eager to play along.

After the search ends up on the front page of the newspaper, the Pidgeons hastily relocate to an isolated house in the country to keep Florie in the dark. When they arrive, they discover that all of their servants have quit. J.C., having been raised there, refuses to hire new ones, fearing that they may be people he grew up with. The family, with the exception of Angela, pitch in. Soon, even Angela is helping out.

Meanwhile, two private detectives are closing in. When they show up at the house, they are lied to, but the detectives are not fooled and set about getting a search warrant.

That night Marchand alludes to the situation, implicitly comparing the family&#x27;s deception to Jacob Marley&#x27;s misdeeds in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; before passing out from too much drink. All of the Pidgeons are ashamed of themselves and finally confess everything to Florie. Later, Marchand wakes up and departs, leaving a note explaining his divided loyalties. Florie tracks him down at a bar in the nearest town and tells him she is going to give half the money to the Pidgeons.

==Production==
The original story by Frances Hyland and Albert Ray was written in 1941 as a vehicle for Binnie Barnes, a comedian known for supporting roles at major studios and leading roles for &quot;low-rent&quot; studios like Republic. &quot;The Cheaters&quot; was bought by Paramount as a comeback vehicle for John Barrymore and Carole Lombard, but was shelved and later recast after the deaths of both stars; ultimately, the story was sold to Republic Pictures. At a time when the studio specialized in low-budget westerns, it was an odd choice for Republic to take on a &quot;screwball comedy&quot;. Many of the stars had to be borrowed from other studios, including Schildkraut, a legendary stage and silent film star. Principal photography for the production ran from February 1 to mid-March 1945.

==Reception==
The unnamed critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;The Cheaters&quot; a scathing review:

Republic wasn&#x27;t kidding when it titled the vapid little film which it delivered yesterday to the Gotham &quot;The Cheaters.&quot; It&#x27;s a swindle, all right. ... the whole thing is trashy—just a compound of witless platitudes. And several good actors are wasted in it.
In a later review, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin was much more charitable: &quot;Excellent cast in enjoyable tale of wealthy family of snobs humanized by downtrodden actor they invite for Christmas dinner.&quot;

<text>Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Koen (1945 – July 20, 2018) was an African-American minister and civil rights activist from Cairo, Illinois who served as prime minister of the Black Liberators and the executive directors of the Black United Front Cairo. Koen worked with organizations in Southern Illinois during the mid- and late 1960s. He founded the Black Liberators in St. Louis, Missouri in 1968; he later went on to lead nationally noted campaigns in Cairo, Illinois, most notably a boycott of white owned businesses. During his Cairo struggles, Koen was honored with a tribute on an album by jazz drummer Max Roach.

Koen was the subject of the FBI&#x27;s Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), an infiltration program sanctioned by FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover and President Richard M. Nixon against Black activists and activist groups in the 1960s and 1970s. Targets of this scheme were individuals and groups such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, H. Rap Brown, Koen, Medgar Evers, the Black Panthers, the Black Liberators and others. The essence of this FBI ploy was to cause division in and amongst Black leadership to prevent organization and unity in the black and poor communities around the nation. Those who were not killed or were not successfully infiltrated were constant subjects of criminal arrests and indictments.

<doc id="1270794" wikidata="Q418157" url="?curid=1270794" title="Phentermine">
<text>Phentermine, sold under the brand name Adipex-P among others, is a medication used together with diet and exercise to treat obesity. It is available by itself or as the combination phentermine/topiramate. Phentermine is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include a fast heart beat, high blood pressure, trouble sleeping, dizziness, and restlessness. Serious side effects may include abuse, but do not include pulmonary hypertension or valvular heart disease, as the latter complications were caused by the fenfluramine component of the &quot;fen-phen&quot; combination. Phentermine is an norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) and produces stimulant, rewarding, and appetite suppressant effects. Chemically, it is a substituted amphetamine.
Phentermine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 149th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions. Phentermine was withdrawn from the market in the United Kingdom in 2000, while the combination medication fen-phen, of which it was a part, was withdrawn from the market in 1997 due to side effects of fenfluramine.

==Medical uses==
Phentermine is used for a short period of time to promote weight loss, if exercise and calorie reduction are not sufficient, and in addition to exercise and calorie reduction.

Phentermine is approved for up to 12 weeks of use and most weight loss occurs in the first weeks. However, significant loss continues through the sixth month and has been shown to continue at a slower rate through the ninth month.

==Contraindications==
Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

Phentermine is contraindicated for users who:

* have a history of drug abuse
* are allergic to sympathomimetic amine drugs
* are taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or have taken one within the last 14 days
* have cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma
* are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

==Adverse effects==
Tolerance usually occurs; however, risks of dependence and addiction are considered negligible. People taking phentermine may be impaired when driving or operating machinery. Consumption of alcohol with phentermine may produce adverse effects.

There is currently no evidence regarding whether or not phentermine is safe for pregnant women.

Other adverse effects include:

* Cardiovascular effects like palpitations, tachycardia, high blood pressure, precordial pain; rare cases of stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest have been reported.
* Central nervous system effects like overstimulation, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, tremor, dizziness and headache; there are rare reports of euphoria followed by fatigue and depression, and very rarely, psychotic episodes and hallucinations.
* Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, cramps, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, and constipation.
* Other adverse effects include trouble urinating, rash, impotence, changes in libido, and facial swelling.

==Interactions==
Phentermine may decrease the effect of drugs like clonidine, methyldopa, and guanethidine. Drugs to treat hypothyroidism may increase the effect of phentermine.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
====Monoamine releasing agent====
Phentermine is a substrate of the monoamine transporters (MATs) and acts as a monoamine releasing agent (MRA), specifically as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). It also acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) to a lesser extent. The drug robustly and dose-dependently elevates brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels in animals. Phentermine is more potent in its effects on norepinephrine than on dopamine and the drug shows only weak effects on serotonin. Unlike many other amphetamines and MRAs, phentermine is completely inactive at the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Due to its actions on the catecholamines, phentermine produces effects including stimulation, rewarding effects, appetite suppression, and sympathomimetic effects in animals and humans.

In terms of monoamine release &quot;in-vitro&quot; using rat brain synaptosomes, phentermine is about 6-fold less potent than dextroamphetamine in the case of norepinephrine release, 11-fold less potent than dextroamphetamine in the case of dopamine release, and has a ratio of norepinephrine release versus dopamine release of about 6.6:1 compared to dextroamphetamine&#x27;s ratio of about 3.5:1. It is more than 3-fold less potent than amphetamine in elevating brain dopamine and serotonin levels in rodents &quot;in vivo&quot;, is about 10-fold less potent than amphetamine in terms of self-administration in monkeys, and is a relatively weak reinforcer in rodents. Although phentermine induces the release of dopamine at sufficiently high concentrations &quot;in vitro&quot; and at sufficiently high doses in rodents and monkeys &quot;in vivo&quot;, it may result in only weak or negligible brain dopamine release in humans at typical clinical doses. This may be due to its selectivity for induction of norepinephrine over dopamine release and may be analogous to the case of ephedrine (which is at least 10-fold selective for induction of norepinephrine over dopamine release). The effects of phentermine may be more related to noradrenergic activation rather than dopaminergic activity. However, more research is needed to assess the preceding notions.

As with other MRAs, phentermine produces dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents at high doses. It can also produce serotonergic neurotoxicity at very high doses in rodents. The clinical significance of these findings for humans, in which employed doses may be much lower, are unclear.

The combination of phentermine with a serotonin releasing agent (SRA) like fenfluramine results in suppression of brain dopamine release by phentermine and marked attenuation or abolition of phentermine&#x27;s stimulant and rewarding effects in animals and humans. Conversely, combined phentermine and fenfluramine administration synergistically enhances the appetite suppression of these drugs in animals and results in greater weight loss than either drug alone in humans. Fenfluramine produces serotonergic neurotoxicity in animals and addition of phentermine results in either no change or augmentation of this neurotoxicity.

====Other actions====
Phentermine has been found to be completely inactive as a ligand or agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. This is in contrast to the serotonin releasing agents (SRAs) fenfluramine, norfenfluramine, and to a lesser extent chlorphentermine. However, another study found that phentermine was a weak human serotonin 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist ( = 1,394nM, Vmax = 66%). In accordance with its lack of serotonin release and serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonism, phentermine appears to show no risk of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) or valvular heart disease (VHD) in humans.

Phentermine has been found to be active as an agonist of the rat and human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). It appears to be a weak human TAAR1 partial agonist ( = 5,470nM and = 68% in one study). The drug shows reduced activity as a TAAR1 agonist compared to amphetamine. TAAR1 agonism by amphetamines that possess this action may serve to auto-inhibit and constrain their effects.

Phentermine is a very weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) &quot;in vitro&quot;. It specifically inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) ( = 85,000–143,000nM) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) ( = 285,000nM). However, its potency as a MAOI is far below its potency as a monoamine releasing agent. Relatedly, phentermine does not show neurochemical signs of MAOI activity in rodents &quot;in vivo&quot;. As such, the significance of phentermine as an MAOI in humans is questionable.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
The pharmacokinetics of phentermine are dose-dependent. Peak concentrations of phentermine are reached 6hours following oral administration of a dose of 15mg. The steady-state levels of phentermine with continuous administration have been found to be around 200ng/mL in clinical studies. The oral bioavailability of phentermine is not affected by intake of a high-fat meal.

====Distribution====
The volume of distribution of phentermine is 5L/kg. Its plasma protein binding is approximately 17.5%.

====Metabolism====
Phentermine undergoes minimal metabolism. Only about 6% of an administered dose of phentermine is metabolized. It is metabolized to a minor extent by &quot;para&quot;-hydroxylation, &quot;N&quot;-oxidation, and &quot;N&quot;-hydroxylation, followed by conjugation.

====Elimination====
The drug is eliminated mainly in urine. It is excreted 62 to 85% unchanged in urine. The elimination half-life of phentermine is 20 to 25hours. The elimination of phentermine is modified by urine acidicity or pH. In the case of acidic urine (pH &lt; 5), the elimination half-life of phentermine has been found to be 7 to 8hours. The clearance of phentermine is 8.79L/h.

==History==
In 1959, phentermine first received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an appetite suppressant. Eventually a hydrochloride salt and a resin form became available.

Phentermine was marketed with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine as a combination appetite suppressant and fat burning agent under the popular name fen-phen. In 1997, after 24 cases of heart valve disease in fen-phen users, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were voluntarily taken off the market at the request of the FDA. Studies later showed nearly 30% of people taking fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for up to 24 months had abnormal valve findings.

Phentermine is still available by itself in most countries, including the US. However, because it is similar to amphetamine, it is classified as a controlled substance in many countries. Internationally, phentermine is a schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the United States, it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In contrast, amphetamine preparations are classified as Schedule II controlled substances.

A company called Vivus developed a combination drug, phentermine/topiramate that it originally called Qnexa and then called Qsymia, which was invented and used off-label by Thomas Najarian, who opened a weight-clinic in Los Osos, California in 2001; Najarian had previously worked at Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, which had developed one of the fen-phen drugs previously withdrawn from the market. The FDA rejected the combination drug in 2010 due to concerns over its safety. In 2012 the FDA approved it after Vivus re-applied with further safety data. At the time, one obesity specialist estimated that around 70% of his colleagues were already prescribing the combination off-label.

==Chemistry==
Phentermine, also known as α,α-dimethylphenethylamine or as α-methylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine. It is the derivative of amphetamine in which a second methyl group is present at the alpha carbon. The drug is a positional isomer of methamphetamine (&quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine) and of other methylamphetamines such as 4-methylamphetamine.

A number of derivatives of phentermine exist, including cericlamine, chlorphentermine, cloforex, clortermine, etolorex, mephentermine, 3,4-methylenedioxyphentermine (MDPH), 3,4-methylenedioxy-&quot;N&quot;-methylphentermine (MDMP or MDMPH), and pentorex, among others. Some of these drugs, including chlorphentermine, cloforex, clortermine, and mephentermine, have been marketed as pharmaceutical drugs similarly to phentermine, for instance as appetite suppressants.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
The term ‘phentermine&#x27; is contracted from phenyl-tertiary-butyl amine.

It is marketed under many brand names and formulations worldwide, including Acxion, Adipex, Adipex-P, Duromine, Elvenir, Fastin, Ionamin, Lomaira (phentermine hydrochloride), Panbesy, Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate), Razin, Redusa, Sentis, Suprenza, and Terfamex.

<text>The Battle of Cerro Gordo, or Battle of Sierra Gordo, was an engagement in the Mexican–American War on April 18, 1847. The battle saw Winfield Scott&#x27;s United States troops outflank Antonio López de Santa Anna&#x27;s larger Mexican army, driving it from a strong defensive position.

==Background==
After United States forces captured the port of Veracruz on March 29, 1847, General Winfield Scott advanced towards Mexico City on April 2 by crossing the Rio Antigua. General Antonio López de Santa Anna, commanding Mexican forces in the area, had prepared fortifications at Cerro Gordo, near Xalapa, with more than 8,700 soldiers in a fortified defile, dominated by El Telegrafo. These included several batteries under the command of brigadier generals Luis Pinzon, Jose Maria Jararo, and Romulo Diaz de la Vega. Scott&#x27;s leading division, commanded by David E. Twiggs, reached the Cerro Gordo Pass on April 12.

==Battle==
On April 12, Lieutenant Pierre G. T. Beauregard, of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, determined that possession of Atalaya Hill would enable the Mexican position to be turned. The &quot;Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant&quot; observe that, in order to determine whether a flanking movement was possible, &quot;reconnaissances were sent out to find, or to make, a road by which the rear of the enemy&#x27;s works might be reached without a front attack.&quot; These reconnaissances were made under the supervision of Captain Robert E. Lee and other officers, &quot;all of whom attained rank and fame.&quot; Grant continues that it was the roadways constructed by the engineers which achieved victory:

Twiggs&#x27; division took the hill on April 17, advancing up the slopes to El Telegrafo. Santa Anna reinforced El Telegrafo with Brigadier General Ciriaco Vasquez&#x27;s 2d Light, 4th, and 11th Infantry. Captain Edward J. Steptoe set up his battery on Atalaya Hill and Major James C. Burnham set up a howitzer across the river.

At 7:00 am on April 18, Twiggs directed William S. Harney&#x27;s brigade to move against the front of El Telegrafo while Bennett C. Riley attacked from the rear. The combination easily took the hill, killing General Vasquez, and Captain John B. Magruder turned the Mexican guns on the retreating Mexicans. Simultaneously, James Shields&#x27; brigade attacked the Mexican camp and took possession of the Jalapa road. Once they realized they were surrounded, the Mexican commanders on the three hills surrendered and by 10:00 am, the remaining Mexican forces fled. 199 officers and 2,837 enlisted men were taken prisoner by the Americans.

==Aftermath==
Santa Anna, caught off guard by the Fourth Regiment of the Illinois Volunteer Infantry, was compelled to ride off without his artificial leg, which was captured by U.S. forces. In the U.S. the prosthetic inspired song parodies. Showman P.T. Barnum claimed he acquired it for display in his museum. The prosthetic was eventually donated to the state of Illinois, where it was displayed in the Illinois State Military Museum in Springfield, Illinois. A visiting Mexican official was apparently embarrassed at seeing the trophy displayed, and it was removed. It was later the subject of controversy about its return to Mexico. Some cannons captured by Americans at Cerro Gordo were brought back to the United States as war trophies. The Third Regiment of Illinois Volunteers brought back a six-pound cannon where it was displayed temporarily in the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts, and whose current whereabouts are unknown.

Scott moved on to Xalapa, and William J. Worth&#x27;s division took San Carlos Fortress on April 22. Scott then occupied Puebla on 15 May, before departing for Mexico City on August 7.

==Eponyms==
Cerro Gordo County, Iowa, Cerro Gordo, North Carolina, Cerro Gordo, Illinois, Cerro Gordo Township, Piatt County, Illinois, and Cerro Gordo Township, Lac qui Parle County, Minnesota take their names from the battle.

==Order of battle==

Mexico was represented by the remnants of the Division of the North, totaling 5,650 personnel: 150 artillery, 4,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry: including the Ampudia Brigade (the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 11th line infantry regiments), the Vasquez Brigade (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th light infantry regiments) and the Juvera Cavalry Brigade (5th, 9th Morelia and the Coraceros cavalry regiments); plus reinforcements from the Capitol: the Rangel Brigade (the 6th Infantry Regiment, Grenadiers of the Guard, Libertad and Galeana battalions, two cavalry squadrons and eight guns), the Pinzon Brigade, and the Canalizo Special Cavalry Division. The 1,000-strong Artega Brigade, consisting of the Pueblo Activos and National Guard battalions, arrived at the end of the battle.

<text>The Lakihegy Tower is a radio mast at Szigetszentmiklós-Lakihegy in Hungary. The Blaw-Knox type tower was built in 1933 and was one of Europe&#x27;s tallest structures at the time of construction. It was designed to provide broadcast coverage for Hungary with a 120 kW transmitter. It was built for the purpose of transmitting the radio station &quot;Budapest I.&quot;, which it served until 1977.

Developed in the U.S., the diamond-shaped mast was specially designed to radiate radio waves in such a way that reduce fading. Thus it was able to serve the whole country.

The mast was destroyed by retreating German troops in World War II, but was later rebuilt in 1946. In 1968 the tower was upgraded to serve the new 300 kW transmitter (amongst others, the ceramic base insulator had to be replaced to withstand the higher voltages).

In 1977 the new 2 MW transmitter at Solt has replaced the Lakihegy Tower as the primary national transmitter. Subsequently, it was nearly torn down in 1981, but widespread objections saved the tower, and later it became a protected industrial monument.

This guyed mast, which is probably still the tallest structure in Hungary, is currently being used for power-distribution control data transmission at 135.6 kHz with a power of 100 kW; the data bursts are at 200 baud with +/- 170 Hz FSK (Frequency Shift Keying).

In Europe there are similar radio masts at Lisnagarvey, Northern Ireland, at Riga, Latvia, at Vakarel, Bulgaria and at Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.

There are two smaller guyed mast radiators for mediumwave at Lakihegy. They are, like the Lakihegy Tower, insulated against ground, but smaller and of conventional construction type.

A further antenna consisting of two free-standing towers is situated at . It is fed by a overhead radio frequency power line.

The medium wave frequency of 540 kHz with 150 kW was diplexed to the Lakihegy Tower in 2006 by Bernd Waniewski.

<doc id="1270817" wikidata="Q299687" url="?curid=1270817" title="Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli">
<text>Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli (; 1700 – 29 April 1771) was an Italian architect who worked mainly in Russia. He developed an easily recognizable style of Late Baroque, both sumptuous and majestic. His major works, including the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg and the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, are famed for extravagant luxury and opulence of decoration.

==Biography==
Rastrelli was born in 1700 in Paris, where his father, Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli (1675–1744), a Florentine sculptor and architect who had trained in Rome, was active. Nothing is known about Francesco&#x27;s Parisian years, but it seems certain that the young man trained and worked in his father&#x27;s workshop. In 1716, Bartolomeo moved to Saint Petersburg, which became a new Russian capital just a four years before, accompanying his father. His ambition was to combine the latest Italian architectural fashion with traditions of the Muscovite Baroque style. The first important commission came in 1721 when he was asked to build a palace for Prince Demetre Cantemir, former ruler of Moldavia.

He was appointed to the post of senior court architect in 1730. His works found favour with female monarchs of his time, and he retained this post throughout the reigns of Empresses Anna (1730–1740) and Elizabeth (1741–1762).

Rastrelli&#x27;s last and most ambitious project was the Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg where Empress Elizabeth was to spend the rest of her life. The projected bell-tower was to become the tallest building in St Petersburg and all of Russia. Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1762 prevented Rastrelli from completing this grand design.

The new empress, Catherine II, dismissed Baroque architecture as an old-fashioned &quot;whipped cream&quot;, and the aged architect retired to Courland, where he supervised the completion and decoration of the ducal palaces.

His last years were spent in obscure commerce with Italian art-dealers. He was elected to the Imperial Academy of Arts several months before his death. 

=== Family ===
He lived with his father and mother, and married Baroness Maria Anna von Walles, born in Berlin in 1710. She bore three children (one son and two daughters) according to the 1737 census.

While Rastrelli&#x27;s son Giuseppe Iacopo died in December 1737 of cholera, and his daughter Eleonora died in January 1738, his daughter Elisabetta Caterina, born in 1734, married architect Francesco Bertogliati, her father&#x27;s assistant.

== Empress Elizabeth of Russia (1741–1761) ==
Peter I&#x27;s daughter was suspicious of all those who served the court of her predecessors. After going through all the architects in St. Petersburg, the Empress was convinced that Francesco Rastrelli is the best. Therefore, Francesco started serving to the Empress only in 1744.

In the period 1744–1760 he built all his famous buildings:

* Summer Palace (destroyed, built up by the Engineering Castle) 
* wooden Winter Palace on the Nevsky (destroyed, urban high-rise buildings) 
* stone Winter Palace (there is, the main building of the Hermitage Museum) 
* Smolny Cathedral and Monastery with four churches and cells 
* Palace for Chancellor Vorontsov (Vorontsov Palace in St. Petersburg, rebuilt as a military school) 
* Stroganov Palace, (it is a branch of the State Russian Museum now) 
* palace in Tsarskoe Selo (restored, Tsarskoe Selo (museum-reserve)) 
* completion and decoration of the interiors of Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg.

== Ten extant buildings by Rastrelli ==
Boris Vipper has speculated that Rastrelli&#x27;s last (and unfinished) design was for the Neoclassical Zaļenieki Manor near Mitava.

== Demolished buildings ==

== Posthumous glory ==
Rastrelli is a cult figure of the Russian Baroque. His engravings with landscapes of Tsarskoe Selo were spread throughout Europe during Rastrelli&#x27;s lifetime, and there are some examples in the collections of Ukraine and Germany.

* A bust of Rastrelli was installed in Tsarskoye Selo.
* The second bust of the famous architect was installed on St. Manege Square in St. Petersburg.
* A square in front of the Smolny Convent has borne Rastrelli&#x27;s name since 1923. 
* In 1972, the documentary &quot;Architect Rastrelli&quot; was made (directed by Maria Kligman, Lennauchfilm, Russia).
* He is the subject of a composition, &quot;Rastrelli in Saint Petersburg&quot;, written in 2000 by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.
* A quartet of Russian cellists, including Kirill Kravtsov, Mikhail Degtyarev, Kirill Timofeev, and Sergei Drabkin, is called Rastrelli. The quartet works in Germany and plays music from the Baroque to modern times.

<text>Balantidium is a genus of ciliates. It contains the parasitic species &quot;Balantidium coli&quot;, the only known cause of balantidiasis.

==History==
The first-described species of &quot;Balantidium&quot;, &quot;B. entozoon&quot;, was described in 1838 by Ehrenberg as a member of the genus &quot;Bursaria&quot;. &quot;Balantidium coli&quot; observed in patients with dysentery was originally described as &quot;Paramecium coli&quot; by Malmstein in 1857. In 1858, Edouard Claparède and Johannes Lachmann created the genus &quot;Balantidium&quot; and reclassified &quot;B. entozoon&quot; as its type species. Stein in 1863, reclassified &quot;Paramecium coli&quot; into the genus &quot;Balantidium&quot;.

==Transcriptomics==
Transcriptome data for &quot;Balantidium ctenopharyngodoni&quot;, from single-cell transcriptome sequencing, were published in 2017 and were the first omics data within the subclass Trichostomatia.

==Taxonomy==
A separate genus – &quot;Neobalantidium&quot; – has been created for several of these species. &quot;Balantidium coli&quot; is one of the species that has been reclassified. It has also been proposed that it is a junior synonym of genus &quot;Balantioides–&quot;which has &quot;B. coli&quot; as the type species.

The closest known relative of this genus is &quot;Buxtonella sulcata&quot;, a parasite of cattle.

==Species==
There are 72 species in the genus.

<text>The Königs Wusterhausen transmitter () was a large transmission facility for longwave, mediumwave and shortwave radio, located near Königs Wusterhausen southeast of Berlin, Germany. Initially built by the telegraph battalion of the German Army, operation began during World War I in 1916. On 22 December 1920, the transmission of a Christmas concert marked the birth of public broadcasting in Germany.

==History==
The German armed forces had conducted experiments in radio technology on the &quot;Windmühlenberg&quot; hill northwest of Königs Wusterhausen since 1911, with mobile stations mounted on horse carriages and antennas held up by captive balloons. Extended signal corps facilities were erected at the site from 1913 onwards, including a large antenna system and several functional buildings. Later called &quot;Senderhaus 1&quot;, the military broadcasting station was put into operation in 1916.

After the war, the German &quot;Reichspost&quot; took over the barracks with effect from September 1919 and used the facilities for the transmission of weather reports, financial news, and telegrams. Radio broadcasting was initiated by post official Hans Bredow and his staff when they used an arc converter supplied by C. Lorenz AG for the first transmission of speech and music in the longwave range on 22 December 1920, making Königs Wusterhausen the &quot;cradle of German broadcasting&quot;. After private radio reception was authorised by law in 1923, transmissions quickly developed throughout the Weimar Republic. The facilities soon had to be enlarged and a second station building (&quot;Sendehaus 2&quot;) was inaugurated in 1923

At Königs Wusterhausen, a nationwide &quot;Deutschlandsender&quot; transmitter was erected in 1925, then consisting of several masts with heights from up to and the high Central Tower. It was soon followed by a longwave transmitter in nearby Zeesen (&quot;Deutschlandsender II&quot;) and the first public shortwave transmitter for international broadcasting (&quot;Weltrundfunksender&quot;), built by the Telefunken company and inaugurated in August 1929. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, these facilities were extensively used for propaganda purposes.

With the end of World War II, Königs Wusterhausen was part of the Soviet occupation zone and several masts were taken down by order of the military government, though the station remained in use for broadcasting in East Germany. The Central Tower collapsed during the Cyclone Quimburga on 15 November 1972. At the date of German reunification in 1990, there was only one high mast with a longwave aerial, two masts for a T-aerial for medium wave and some small towers. The remaining transmitters for mediumwave, shortwave and longwave were shut down between 1992 and 1999 and the whole area was transformed into a museum, which is marked by the 210-metre-high mast.

For mobile phone services and low power FM broadcasting, a 67-metre-high free-standing tower of concrete was built in 1994.

<doc id="1270850" wikidata="Q78801" url="?curid=1270850" title="Melchior Klesl">
<text>Melchior Klesl (19 February 1552 – 18 September 1630) was an Austrian statesman and cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church during the time of the Counter-Reformation. He was minister-favourite of King and Emperor Matthias (1609-1618) and a leading advocate for peace between the empire&#x27;s different confessional leagues before the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Klesl was appointed Bishop of Vienna in 1602 and elevated to cardinal in December.

==Biography==
He was born in Vienna to Lutheran Protestant parents, with his father being a baker his surname was also written Khlesl, Klesel or Cleselius.

Klesl studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and converted to Catholicism after he had been impressed by the preaching of the Jesuits. He entered the Faculty of Philosophy at University of Vienna in 1570. In 1574, he joined the “Papal Alumnat”, a boarding school for prospective priests that as run by the Jesuits in Vienna. Emperor Rudolf II then became aware of him as a promising candidate for the priesthood and wanted to use him for his plans for a campaign against his Protestant noble estates and towns, as well as for a church reform in Lower Austria.

In 1579, Khesl, now a doctor of philosophy, was given the post of cathedral provost of St. Stephen&#x27;s, in Vienna, and received his ordination to the priesthood. 

The emperor and his advisors pressured the prince-bishop of Passau, Urban of Trenbach, to make Klesl his official representative in Vienna to carry out a reform of the Catholic clergy. Trenbach, appointed Klesl as his official representative for Lower Austria in 1580 and in 1581 as his vicar-general in Vienna. His task was to discipline the dissolute and lax Catholic clergy. As cathedral provost and chancellor of the university, he worked on behalf of the emperor to make adherence to the Catholic confession a duty for professors and students. As an official, he was also given the task by Rudolf II to return the Protestant towns in Lower Austria to the faith of the emperor. The campaign had its peak between 1585 and 1588.

Klesl’s moderate measures during his campaign to Catholicise Lower Austria again became the source of some tension with Jesuits like the hardliner Father Georg Scherer, which soon led to an open contention. To calm things down, Klesl claimed that Scherer had convinced him to convert and that both had the same goal. In 1588, Rudolf appointed Klesl as administrator of the Diocese of Wiener Neustadt.

Because it lost some powerful supporters such as Leonhard IV von Harrach in Vienna and Adam von Dietrichstein at the imperial court in Prague and Governor Archduke Ernst, the Counter-Reformation was gradually losing support against the opposition to the government in Vienna. Even the intervention of Emperor Rudolf II failed to help. The opposition, especially from Chancellor Wolfgang Unverzagt, who was regarded as in Archduke Matthias&#x27;s government in Vienna, was too strong.

Unverzagt proposed making Klesl bishop of the small rundown Bishopric of Vienna, which was intended to take the wind out of his sails. Klesl’s allies in Prague, privy councillors Wolf Rumpf and Paul Sixt III von Trautson, could not do anything against it. To avoid political insignificance, Klesl attempted to be named to an influential position on the staff of Archduke Matthias.

In 1598, Archduke Maximilian III, who presided over the Hungarian Diet in Pressburg for his brother Matthias, announced Klesl’s nomination as Bishop of Vienna. After a sensation, provoked by Klesl himself, who announced that he would run the bishopric with heavy-handedness against the government in Vienna, the nomination was withdrawn. Gerber, in 1602, he was installed as bishop after his demands for economic support for the bishopric had been fulfilled. Klesl was named Bishop of Vienna, a diocese that was spiritually and materially in a state of degradation. On 30 Mar 1614, he was consecrated bishop by Placido della Marra, Bishop of Melfi e Rapolla. He received the purple from Paul V in 1616. 

His appointment as Bishop of Vienna took place in a phase of high hopes in Prague, Vienna and Graz, that the Catholic House of Austria would reassert its position against the Protestant opposition in the Habsburg monarchy; Klesl favoured confronting the opposition. Meanwhile, the Brothers&#x27; Quarrel, the struggle between Emperor Rudolf II and his brothers for succession in the Habsburg monarchy and the empire, had sharpened. Specifically, the ambition of Matthias to become emperor himself offered Klesl the opportunity to increase his influence at the court in Vienna.

Klesel tried to thread a marriage of Matthias to Bavarian Princess Magdalena to get the Dukes of Bavaria as Catholic allies in the struggle for the throne of Rudolf II. In the end, the negotiations came to nothing because Magdalena did not want to be his wife.

Since 1605, the uprising of Stefan Bocskai in Hungary and Transylvania, both Rudolf and Governor Matthias in Vienna had been pursuing a more moderate policy towards the Protestant opposition in the estates of the Habsburg monarchy because they needed their support against Bocskai. Klesl opposed the policy, but the final decision lay in the hands of the council around Matthias and, increasingly, Karl I von Liechtenstein, privy councillor of Rudolf II and sometimes his high steward. Liechtenstein increasingly dominated the politics of Archduke Matthias to the point of a putsch against his brother, Emperor Rudolf II. Matthias took over Austria, Moravia and Hungary but had to make, however, especially with the advice of Liechtenstein, difficult concessions to his allied estates. 

In spring 1609, Klesl finally reached the high point of his power in Vienna by becoming the minister-favourite of Matthias, but to be formally the president of privy council, he had to wait until January 1613. Liechtenstein left the court. Klesl&#x27;s struggle for the position of the dominant minister in Vienna, however, continued until December 1611, when Liechtenstein gave up and admitted his defeat. 

In 1609, Klesl tried to withdraw the concessions that had been made to the oppositional estates made by Liechtenstein and his supporters, but the quarrel with the emperor, as well as the political and economic weakness of Matthias, forced Klesl to take an increasingly-moderate stance toward the Protestant opposition, even the Calvinists. Klesl was working to make Matthias the next emperor. 

For that goal, he needed the Protestant electors. The ecclesiastical (bishop) electors supported Archduke Albrecht VII, the brother of Matthias and the ruler of the Spanish Netherlands, to be the next emperor. After the death of Rudolf II, the election of Matthias succeeded because of the Protestant vote. As the minister-favourite of the new emperor, Klesl at first pursued a policy of mobilising the empire&#x27;s estates for a new war against the Ottoman Empire to unify the hostile confessional camps under Matthias, but that move proved to be a failure.

That made him begin in 1614 to negotiate with Ottoman envoys for a new peace treaty. The Treaty of Vienna in 1615 with the Ottomans was probably his greatest political success. His efforts to settle the conflicts among the confessional associations, the Protestant Union and the Catholic League, were much less successful. His attempts to dissolve the confessional alliances to create a party of the emperor faced insurmountable resistance.

Since the coronation of Matthias as emperor, the question of succession had immediately become an important political issue because Matthias had in his marriage with Anna of Tyrol no male heir to succeed him. The King of Spain wanted to make his son emperor and before that King of Bohemia and Hungary. Archduke Ferdinand of Inner Austria also claimed those crowns and found with Maximilian III a scheming supporter. The negotiations with Philip III lasted until a treaty between Philip and Ferdinand, the Oñate Treaty in the spring of 1617. Archdukes Maximilian III and Ferdinand urged the election of Ferdinand as Emperor before the Habsburgs reached any agreement about the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary, but Klesl first wanted negotiations with the Calvinist electors to save the election. Maximilian III saw that as a tactic to prolong the election and so Klesl needed protection against his enemies in the House of Austria and its Catholic supporters. The device was that Emperor Matthias convinced the pope to make Klesl a cardinal. 

On 2 December 1615 Pope Paul V made Klesl &quot;in pectore&quot; cardinal, which he had proclaimed on the April 11, 1616. Klesl received Santa Maria degli Angeli as his titular church but in 1623 switched to San Silvestro in Capite.

Maximilian III had in 1616 planned to murder Cardinal Klesl, but his cousin Ferdinand held him back. The uprising in Bohemia after the Defenestration if Prague ultimately led to the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and had brought about the end of Klesl’s position as minister-favourite because of his preferential treatment of a moderate reaction since the emperor lacked the money for a military answer, and Philip III signalled no strong assistance. On 20 July 1618 Maximilian III, Ferdinand II (now King of Bohemia and Hungary) and Spanish Ambassador Inigo Velez de Guevara, Conde de Oñate, arrested Klesl and held him prisoner in Tyrol.

The pope sent a special envoy, Cardinal Fabrizio Verospi, to investigate Klesl&#x27;s case. Verospi urged in the name of Paul V for the cardinal to be placed under ecclesiastical arrest. In 1619, Klesl was brought to the monastery of St. Georgenberg, where he was held in ecclesiastical custody and under the supervision of the government in Innsbruck. By papal diplomacy, especially by Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, Klesl could be transferred to Castel Sant’ Angelo, in Rome, on 23 October 1622 and the accusations against him were so reduced that no legitimate reason for his arrest remained. On 18 June 1623 Pope Gregory XV released him from custody. In Rome, Klesl carried on political activities in support for his earlier enemies Maximilian I of Bavaria and Johann Schweikhart von Cronberg, Elector of Mainz. In Vienna, the policy was seen as revenge on Emperor Ferdinand II. To get Klesl out of Rome, Ferdinand accepted full satisfaction for Cardinal Klesl. Pope Urban VIII cleared Klesl of any guilt, and in the autumn of 1626, he was allowed to leave Rome. On 25 January 1628 Klesl entered the Cathedral of St. Stephen, in Vienna, in a festive procession and resumed his episcopate. The Catholic alliance seemed to be very successful in its war against the Protestant princes and their allies, but Ferdinand II, influenced by his Jesuit confessor, Wilhelm Lamormaini, wanted to exploit their victories to continue to push Protestant princes back as far as possible. However Klesl held to his conviction that the war could not be won and that it would be better for the emperor and the Catholic Church to proceed more prudently.

He died in Wiener Neustadt in 1630. His heart reposes before the high altar of the Cathedral of Wiener Neustadt, and his body rests in the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna.

Inhabitants of Vienna recognise Klesl&#x27;s name mainly because &quot;Khleslplatz&quot; (&quot;Khlesl Square&quot;), in Vienna&#x27;s 12th district, Meidling, in the former village of Altmannsdorf, has been named after him, allegedly because he used to stop at No. 12 on his journeys from Wiener Neustadt to Vienna. Since 1978, the 16th-century building has housed the &quot;Renner-Institut&quot;, the political academy of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, and No. 6 was until 1998 the site of the &quot;Tierschutzhaus&quot; of the &quot;Wiener Tierschutzverein&quot; (founded in 1846), where generations of animal lovers would go to collect homeless pets.

==Episcopal succession==
As bishop, he was the principal consecrator of the following:
*Péter Pázmány, Archbishop of Esztergom (1617); 
*Lilio Livioi, Auxiliary Bishop of Constantinople (1625); 
*Vincenzo Martinelli (bishop), Bishop of Conversano (1625); and
*Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta, Titular Archbishop of &quot;Thessalonica&quot; (1628).

<text>A kontusz (, ; ; ; originally from , ) is a type of outer garment worn by the Hungarian and Polish–Lithuanian male nobility. It became popular in the 16th century and came to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth rule via Hungary from Turkey. In the 17th century, worn over an inner garment (&quot;żupan&quot;), the &quot;kontusz&quot; became a notable element of male Polish national and Zaporozhian Cossack attire.

The &quot;kontusz&quot; was a long robe, usually reaching to below the knees, with a set of decorative buttons down the front. The sleeves were long and loose, on hot days worn untied, thrown on the back. In winter a fur lining could be attached to the &quot;kontusz&quot;, or a delia worn over it. The &quot;kontusz&quot; was usually of a vivid colour, and the lining was of a contrasting hue. The &quot;kontusz&quot; was tied with a long, wide sash called a &quot;pas kontuszowy&quot;.

The &quot;kontusz&quot; was more of a decorative garment than a practical one. Tradition states that the first &quot;kontusze&quot; were worn by szlachta who captured them from Ottomans to display as loot, which itself possibly originated from Mongol Haiqing which had openings in armpit. 

Throwing &quot;kontusz&quot; sleeves on one&#x27;s back and stroking one&#x27;s moustache was considered to be a signal of readiness for a fight.

In 1776, Sejm deputies from different voivodeships of Poland were obliged to wear different coloured żupany and &quot;kontusze&quot; denoting their voivodeships.

In Poland, the &quot;kontusz&quot; was worn mainly by the nobility, but it was also adopted by the Zaporozhian cossacks when Ukraine and Ruthenia were under Polish rule.

<text>Shlomo Artzi (; born 26 November 1949) is an Israeli folk rock musician, composer, music producer, radio host and singer-songwriter. He is one of the most popular and successful musicians in Israel.

==Biography==
Shlomo Artzi was born on Moshav Alonei Abba. Artzi&#x27;s parents were Holocaust survivors and their memories deeply influenced him and his sister Nava Semel, a playwright. His father, Yitzhak Artzi, a Zionist activist in Bukovina, Romania in his youth, was later a member of the Knesset. His maternal grandmother was the sister of Rabbi Meir Shapiro.

When Artzi was eight years old, his family moved to north Tel Aviv. Artzi&#x27;s schoolmates thought he would become an actor, not a musician, as he was known for his acting skills at elementary school. However, at the age of twelve, he started playing the guitar and singing in a boy scouts group and at friends&#x27; parties.
Artzi has been married twice and has three children from his first marriage: Ben Artzi (singer), Shiri Artzi (author married to Yiftach Klein), and Jonathan Artzi.

Artzi resides in Ramat Gan. He is a fan of the football club Maccabi Netanya and composed its championship song in 1971.

==Music career==
=== 1960s: Teen and army bands ===
At age 16, he began writing and composing songs. As the Sinai Duo, he started performing before soldiers, along with his classmate Rivka Menashe, who later gained fame as Riki Gal.

During his military service, Artzi was recruited to the Artillery Corps, and after serving for a year and a half, he joined Lehakat Kheil Hayam (Israeli Navy Band). While in this band, he took part in the programs &quot;And on the Third Day&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, alongside other soon-to-be Israeli celebrities, such as Rivka Zohar, Dov Glickman, Avi Uriah and Riki Gal. He was yet to stand out during the first program. By the second program, he became the lead singer and one of the main stars. He sang lead vocals on several songs on the Group&#x27;s LPs.

=== 1970s: Emerging and evolving as a solo singer ===
In 1970, Artzi competed in the Israel Song Festival. Still in military service and wearing a military uniform, he sang &quot;Pitom Achshav, Pitom Hayom&quot; (Suddenly Now, Suddenly Today), also known as &quot;Ahavtiha&quot; (I loved her). The song, written by Tirtza Atar and composed by Ya&#x27;akov Hollander, won first prize. It was included in his first album, &quot;Shlomo Artzi,&quot; which came out in 1970, and came in first in the annual chart-toppers countdown of Kol Israel. Artzi was voted Singer of the Year.
In 1975 he was selected to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest. The selected song was &quot;At Ve&#x27;Ani&quot; (You and Me), written by Israeli songwriter Ehud Manor, and composed by Artzi himself. &quot;At Va&#x27;Ani&quot; won 11th place. 

Over the next few years, Artzi&#x27;s records did not sell well and he produced few hit singles. Most of these albums became rare collectibles. In 1977, he made &quot;He lost his way…&quot; (גבר הולך לאיבוד, Gever Holekh Le&#x27;ibud) whose success convinced Artzi to continue singing. In 1979 he recorded &quot;Drachim&quot; (Ways), with a fresher style. His 1981 LP &quot;Khatzot&quot; (Midnight) was the second part of &quot;Drachim&quot;.

=== 1980s: Dance, Restless Night, July-August Heat ===
Artzi&#x27;s fame rose throughout the 1980s and reached a peak with the release of the albums &quot;Dance&quot; (Tirkod) and &quot;Restless Night&quot; (לילה לא שקט, Layla Lo Shaket) which sold tens of thousands. He began to appear in the country&#x27;s largest parks and theatres.

In 1980 Artzi hosted his radio show on Israel&#x27;s Military Radio station, Galgaley Tzahal. In this show, he talked about the week&#x27;s headlines and told interesting stories about things he heard or saw. &quot;Od lo Shabbat&quot; (It&#x27;s not Sabbath yet) was broadcast on Fridays. 

His records &quot;Tirkod&quot; (Dance, 1984), &quot;Layla Lo Shaket&quot; (Restless Night, 1986), and &quot;Hom Yuli August&quot; (July-August Heat, 1988) albums sold hundred thousand copies, and his live shows at Israel&#x27;s largest concert venues were fully booked.

=== 1990s: Ticket to the Luna Park, Moon, Two ===
Artzi opened the nineties with the album &quot;Kartis Laluna Park&quot; (&quot;Ticket to Luna Park&quot;), produced by Louis Lahav and arranged by Adi Rennert. Artzi wrote and composed most of the songs on the album, including &quot;Nikhnast Lechayay&quot;, &quot;Rocker Chayay&quot;, &quot;Me-Ever LaNahar&quot; and &quot;Agadat HaEsrim VeAhat&quot;. Rennert composed the song &quot;Situatia&quot; to the words of Artzi. After the great successes of his previous albums, the album was considered a commercial failure, and did not leave many hits, although it did not stop the glory days of Artzi.

In 1992 Artzi released &quot;Yareah&quot; (, &quot;Moon&quot;), one of his most successful albums. Out of twelve songs on it, eight became radio hits and finally solidified Artzi&#x27;s status in Israeli popular music.

In 1995 popular Israeli musicians recorded a CD together in memory of Yitzhak Rabin, named &quot;Shalom Chaver&quot;. Shlomo Artzi played two songs during the memorial service, which later became anthems of those days – &quot;Haish Ha&#x27;hu&quot; (That Man) and &quot;Uf Gozal&quot; (Fly Little Bird), which was originally written and recorded by Arik Einstein and Miki Gavrielov.

In 1996 Artzi released a double album called &quot;Shnayim&quot; (&quot;Two&quot;), selling an almost unprecedented 160,000 copies, making it a certified 4× platinum record. The most notable songs in this CD were the title track, sung with Israeli singer Rita, &quot;Hi Lo Yoda&#x27;at Ma Over Alai&quot; (&quot;She Doesn&#x27;t Know What I&#x27;m Going Through&quot;), &#x27;&quot;Menagev Lakh Et Hadmaot&quot; (&quot;Wiping Away Your Tears &quot;) &quot;Ze Ma Shenish&#x27;ar&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s What&#x27;s Left&quot;), &quot;Ha&#x27;ahava Hayeshana&quot; (&quot;The Old Love&quot;), &quot;Le&#x27;an, Le&#x27;an, Le&#x27;an&quot; (&quot;Where, Where, Where&quot;), &quot;Shisha&quot; (&quot;Six&quot;), &quot;Absurd&quot; and &quot;Dokh Retzhakh&quot; (&quot;Murder Report&quot;) on the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin compared to that of JFK. &quot;Shnayim&quot; signaled the beginning of a string of original material, among them some of the best-selling Israeli records of all time.

=== 2000s: I Loved Them, Thirst, Sane ===

In 2000 Artzi released &quot;Ahavtihem&quot; (&quot;I Loved Them&quot;), a collection of reworked love songs, many originally written by him for other artists. The album featured a revision of his hit &quot;Ahavtiha&quot; (&quot;I Loved Her&quot;), &quot;Nof Yaldoot&quot; (&quot;Scenes from Childhood&quot;), &quot;Anakhnu Lo Tzrikhim&quot; (&quot;We Don&#x27;t Need&quot;), &quot;At Va&#x27;ani&quot; (&quot;You and Me&quot;), &quot;Ma&#x27;avir Daf&quot; (&quot;Turning the Page&quot;) – a duet with Nurit Galron (who performed the song originally), &quot;Shir Preda&quot; (&quot;A Goodbye Song&quot;) – a duet with his singer-songwriter son, Ben Artzi and &quot;Melekh ha&#x27;olam&quot; (&quot;King of the World&quot;, a Hebrew translated cover of White Plains &quot;When You Are a King&quot;). The album went on to sell over 200,000 copies – an unprecedented achievement in the little Israeli music market.

&quot;Tzima&#x27;on&quot; (&quot;Thirst&quot;), released in 2002, featured the title track as its lead single, as well as &quot;Al-Pi Tnuat Harakavot&quot; (&quot;The Way the Trains Run&quot;) LeHatzil Otakh (&quot;To Save You&quot;)
and &quot;Ptzatzat Atom Bashamaim&quot; (&quot;Atom Bomb in the Sky&quot;). The albums sold over 60,000 copies (3× gold record) in the first two weeks of their release but the reviews were critical. Artzi later described these albums as flawed.

In 2007 Artzi released &quot;Shfuyim&quot; (&quot;Sane&quot;). The album came out in July, with a lead single &quot;Ha&#x27;amiti&quot; (&quot;The Real&quot;). His collaboration with Mooke (of the Rap-Rock band Shabak Samekh) was panned. &quot;Nitzmadnu&quot; helped to restore his reputation with a catchy sing-along melodic line and lyrics. The came one of Artzi&#x27;s most enduring hits, &quot;TeTa&#x27;aru Lakhem&quot; (&quot;Imagine Yourselves&quot;), with a romantic message: &quot;Imagine yourselves a beautiful world, a little less sad than it actually is, and there we are, walking, with sunshine in our pockets&quot;.

=== 2010s: Happiness Express, Whipped Cream ===
In 2012 Artzi finally released &quot;Osher Express&quot; (&quot;Happiness Express&quot;). This album enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success. It featured a strong collection of new songs, beloved singles, and an intriguing lead-off single: &quot;Khozrim Habaita&quot; (&quot;Coming Home&quot;) which featured the iconic Israeli singer Arik Einstein. This was followed by &quot;Kol Yom&quot; (&quot;Every Day&quot;), a life-affirming duet with Dudu Tasa &quot;Latet Velakakhat&quot; (&quot;Negotiating&quot;), and a spiritual duet with Abraham Tal &quot;Elohim&quot; (&quot;God&quot;). Additional singles produced at this time were &quot;Nedaber Mehalev&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Speak from the Heart&quot;) and &quot;Shelo Ye&#x27;almu Hadvarim Hayafim&quot; (&quot;Hoping the Beautiful Things Don&#x27;t Disappear&quot;). The album included &quot;Ometz&quot; (&quot;Courage&quot;), &quot;Florida&quot;, and Artzi&#x27;s unique take on the wave of social protests in 2012, &quot;Kayitz Be&#x27;eretz Lu&quot; (&quot;Summer in If-Land&quot;).

In 2016, Artzi released &quot;Katzefet&quot; (&quot;Whipped Cream&quot;).

<text>The Northwest Railway Museum (NRM) is a railroad museum in Snoqualmie, King County, Washington. It incorporates a heritage railway, historic depot, exhibit hall, library, and collection care center, and serves more than 130,000 visitors per year.

The heritage railway incorporates five miles of the line constructed in 1889 by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS&amp;E), which was part of Seattle&#x27;s response to the Northern Pacific selecting Tacoma as their western terminus. The SLS&amp;E was later purchased by the Northern Pacific.

==Snoqualmie depot==
The Snoqualmie depot was built in 1890 by the SLS&amp;E. The depot is an example of a building that was in nearly every community across the nation. Good architecture was good advertising and enhanced company pride. The station once served as the terminal for this early recreation area. An atypical design was the result of the need for a rural combined freight-passenger depot, however, one with lavish decorations to reflect the holiday spirit of vacationers from Seattle. Visitors came to enjoy hunting and fishing, as well as excursions to Snoqualmie Falls.

The station is a large frame building about with a generous eaves. A bay window features the telegrapher&#x27;s office. The semicircular north end stands out in this design. The eaves are supported by wooden pillars and diagonal braces and scroll work decorates the intersection of the braces with the eaves and the pillars.
The current structure was modified from the original, in which the bay window continued up through the roof and formed an octagonal tower a full story in height. A two sash window with a semicircular upper sash appeared on each face of the tower and a prominent cornice separated the tower body from the steeply pitched roof. The roof was decorated with fancy butt shingles and capped with a finial. A large swept dormer was placed in the southern part of the main structure above the freight section, Cast iron cresting and fancy butt shingles decorated the roof of both the main body and the transverse dormer. The freight dock, was wider originally and ran the length of the entire rear third of the station, is now a small porch in front of a single sliding freight door.

The Snoqualmie depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, ID #74001963.

==Museum==
The Northwest Railway Museum was founded in 1957 as the Puget Sound Railway Historical Association. As part of a general reorganization, the museum took its current name in September 1999. The mission of the organization is to develop and operate an outstanding railway museum where the public can see and understand the role of railroads in the development of the Pacific Northwest, and experience the excitement of a working railroad.

The museum&#x27;s collection includes a variety of railway cars and locomotives that document the growth of the railway network in Washington from the 1880s through the 1990s. One of the items included is the Messenger of Peace Chapel Car which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It also includes a 3,000-volume library and archives that focus on the history of railroads in the Northwest and on technical and other engineering aspects of railroading.

== Collection ==
=== Steam locomotives ===
=== Diesel locomotives ===

=== Gasoline-Mechanical locomotives ===

=== Passenger cars ===
The Northwest Railway Museum maintains 18 passenger cars of various time periods, manufactured between 1881 and 1998. Most of these cars were built by either Barney and Smith, the St. Louis Car Company, or Pullman. Several of the passenger cars operate with one of the museum&#x27;s 2 RS4-TCs and/or Northern Pacific 924 for excursion service on the Snoqualmie Valley Railroad.

=== Freight, industrial, and maintenance of way equipment ===
The museum owns a total of 39 other railway equipment artifacts in various forms, previously operating for a wide variety of railroads. While not included as historic equipment, there is also the various pieces of equipment used to maintain the railway, some of which dates as far back as the 1950s.

==Heritage railroad==
The Northwest Railway Museum operates a heritage railroad called the Snoqualmie Valley Railroad. This route allows museum visitors to experience a train excursion aboard antique railroad coaches dating to 1915 and earlier. Trains are scheduled either Saturday, or Saturday and Sunday depending on the time of year, with chartered or special trains on various days. The railroad typically carries over 60,000 passengers per year. The railroad hosts several special events, such as the Day Out with Thomas event every July. Other events include Christmas &amp; Halloween trains, wine tasting specials, and chartered excursions such as educational trains and corporate events.

==Railway History Center==
In August 2006 the Museum dedicated the new Conservation and Restoration Center (CRC), phase one of the Railway History Center. The CRC is a place to perform repairs and restoration work on the museum&#x27;s different pieces of equipment, including locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. It features , two full-length inspection pits, and is used to perform many functions once conducted in railroad backshops. A full assortment of carpentry and machining equipment allows the museum to produce parts that have been out of production since the 1960s.

<doc id="1270863" wikidata="Q6287456" url="?curid=1270863" title="Joseph Tommasi">
<text>Joseph Charles Tommasi (April 15, 1951 – August 15, 1975) was an American Neo-Nazi who founded the National Socialist Liberation Front. He advocated extremism and armed guerrilla warfare against the U.S. government and what he called its &quot;Jewish power structure.&quot; Tommasi wanted anarchy and lawlessness so that the &quot;system&quot; could be attacked without protection. Tommasi was derisively nicknamed &quot;Tomato Joe&quot; by rival neo-Nazis because of his Italian heritage and &quot;less than Nordic complexion.&quot; He was later expelled from the group for using drugs and misusing group funds.

Tommasi was shot and killed during a fight with a fellow Neo-Nazi in 1975.

==Politics==
Influenced by William Luther Pierce, Tommasi first rose to prominence as a young leader within the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party (NSWPP, earlier known as the American Nazi Party) in Arlington County, Virginia.

In 1969, Tommasi launched the National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF) as a youth wing of the American Nazi Party. In 1970, David Duke joined the organization.

In February 1972, Irv Rubin, a Jewish militant of the Jewish Defense League, was arrested after firing at Tommasi. However, he was never charged.

The NSWPP had splintered following the 1967 murder of George Lincoln Rockwell, and Tommasi frequently found himself at odds with Rockwell&#x27;s successor, Matthias Koehl. Koehl, a strait-laced follower of Adolf Hitler, objected to Tommasi&#x27;s radical viewpoints, as well as his personal habits, which included smoking marijuana, wearing long hair, listening to rock and roll and inviting a girlfriend for sex at NSWPP headquarters. These led to Tommasi being ejected from the NSWPP in 1973.

In March 1974, Tommasi launched the NSLF as a separate organization. The group attracted many of the younger and more radical members of the NSWPP. It used propaganda such as pictures showing the twisted wreckage of a Bank of America branch.

Tommasi sought membership among white college students who felt alienated by both the radical leftist movement as well as the mainstream conservative right. However, Tommasi had not given up trying to regain control of the NSWPP.

==Death==
On August 15, 1975, Tommasi was shot in the head and killed in front of the headquarters of the NSWPP in El Monte, California. Numerous weapons were found at the headquarters, including a gun that had been recently fired. David Rust, who was with Tommasi at the time, stated that someone had directed an obscene gesture towards them. Witnesses said Tommasi had walked into the front yard carrying a club and got into an argument. One NSWPP member allegedly warned him that if he came any closer, he would be shot. Jerry Keith Jones, an 18-year-old NSWPP member, was arrested for the murder. Jones later pleaded guilty to second degree murder for killing Tommasi and was sentenced to 300 days in the county jail and placed on probation for five years. Another Neo-Nazi, Clyde Frank Bingham, was initially charged two count of assault with a deadly weapon. However, the charges were later dropped. 

Tommasi was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park.

==Legacy==
Tommasi&#x27;s life inspired fellow Neo-Nazi James Mason to revive the NSLF in the early 1980s as a leaderless &quot;philosophical concept or a state of mind&quot; called Universal Order and to resurrect Tommasi&#x27;s &quot;Siege&quot; periodical.

<text>Susan Mary Woodford-Hollick, Baroness Hollick, OBE (born 16 May 1945) is a British businesswoman and consultant with a wide-ranging involvement in broadcasting and the arts. A former investigative journalist, she worked for many years in television (as Sue Woodford), where her roles included producer/director of &quot;World in Action&quot; for Granada TV and founding commissioning editor of Multicultural Programmes for Channel Four. As a campaigner for human rights, world health, literacy, and the arts, she serves as trustee or patron of a range of charities and foundations. She is founder and co-director of Bringing up Baby Ltd, a childcare company. Other causes and organisations with which she is associated include the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), the Leader&#x27;s Quest Foundation, Complicité theatre company, Reprieve, the Free Word Centre, the Runnymede Trust and the SI Leeds Literary Prize. Of English and Trinidadian heritage, she is the wife of Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, with whom she has three daughters.

==Early life==
Sue Woodford-Hollick was educated at the University of Sussex and is the daughter of Ulric Cross, a former High Court judge in Trinidad, Trinidadian High Commissioner to London (1990–93) and much-decorated RAF squadron leader in World War II (who inspired the 2018 film &quot;Hero&quot; by Frances-Anne Solomon). On BBC &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on 8 August 2012, in the feature &quot;Family Secrets&quot; for which she was interviewed by her daughter Abigail, Woodford-Hollick spoke about growing up believing that she had been adopted by the white parents she knew as &quot;Auntie May and Uncle Dick&quot;, only to discover in her twenties that her natural father was a Caribbean war hero and that her much older &quot;sister&quot; was in fact her mother, who had been forced to marry someone else: &quot;Illegitimacy was not accepted in those days, and prejudice against black people was rife everywhere.&quot; Woodford-Hollick contributed the memoir &quot;Who I Was Then and Who I Am Now&quot; to the 2019 anthology &quot;New Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby.

==Career==
In 1969, Woodford-Hollick joined Granada Television in Manchester as a newsreader and presenter/reporter on the regional news magazine programme, and she went on to become one of the few women to produce/direct the flagship current affairs programme &quot;World in Action&quot;. 

In 1981, she joined Channel 4 Television as the first Commissioning Editor for multi-cultural programming, one of the priorities of the new channel, where she commissioned a range of programmes to reflect the diversity of Britain&#x27;s minority ethnic communities. Her work at Channel 4 was described by Farrukh Dhondy as &quot;revolutionary&quot;.

==Consultancy and voluntary work==
She has been involved throughout her life with many campaigns for human rights and diversity. Between 1993 and 2000, she chaired &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, the international magazine for free speech, of which she remains a patron.

In September 2000, she succeeded Trevor Phillips as Chair of the London Arts Board, and on the creation of a single funding body for the arts in England, Woodford-Hollick was appointed in 2002 to the national council of the new organisation, Arts Council England (ACE), and to chair its London regional council, which she did for seven years. 

She has been an adviser on Caribbean affairs to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and in 1998 she served on the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain, an independent inquiry set up by the Runnymede Trust and chaired by Lord Parekh. She has also served on the boards of a wide range of organisations, including Talawa Theatre Company, the Theatre Museum, Tate Members, the Royal Commonwealth Society Contemporary Dance Trust, the English National Opera and the University of Westminster.

She is currently a trustee of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), Africa&#x27;s largest health NGO, based in Nairobi, Kenya. She chairs the Leader&#x27;s Quest Foundation and has served as a trustee of Complicite theatre company and of Reprieve. She is also a patron of the Runnymede Trust and a trustee of the Free Word Centre. In addition, she is a patron of the SI Leeds Literary Prize, an award for unpublished fiction for Black and Asian women in the UK.

In April 2012, in Port of Spain, Trinidad, she announced the inauguration of the Hollick Arvon Caribbean Writers Prize, sponsored by the Hollick Family Charitable Trust and the Arvon Foundation, in association with the NGC Bocas Lit Fest, an award to allow a Caribbean writer living in the Anglophone region and writing in English, and who has not yet published a full-length book, to devote time to advancing a work in progress.

She was named as one of the supporters of the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction 2013.

She is a trustee of the foundation announced in December 2014 in memory of cultural theorist Stuart Hall.

==Personal life==
She is married to the businessman Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, with whom she has three daughters.

==Honours and awards==
She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the arts. She is an Honorary Fellow of the University of Westminster and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

She is regularly included on the Power List of &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Most Influential Black People&quot;.

In January 2018, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Sussex.

She is an honorary fellow of Merton College, Oxford.

<text>In mathematics, a random minimum spanning tree may be formed by assigning independent random weights from some distribution to the edges of an undirected graph, and then constructing the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

When the given graph is a complete graph on vertices, and the edge weights have a continuous distribution function whose derivative at zero is , then the expected weight of its random minimum spanning trees is bounded by a constant, rather than growing as a function of . More precisely, this constant tends in the limit (as goes to infinity) to , where is the Riemann zeta function and is Apéry&#x27;s constant. For instance, for edge weights that are uniformly distributed on the unit interval, the derivative is , and the limit is just . For other graphs, the expected weight of the random minimum spanning tree can be calculated as an integral involving the Tutte polynomial of the graph.

In contrast to uniformly random spanning trees of complete graphs, for which the typical diameter is proportional to the square root of the number of vertices, random minimum spanning trees of complete graphs have typical diameter proportional to the cube root.

Random minimum spanning trees of grid graphs may be used for invasion percolation models of liquid flow through a porous medium, and for maze generation.

<text>Nguyễn Khác Chính (16 February 1924 – 24 September 2016) was a Vietnamese attorney, writer and anti-communist resistant, who became a political prisoner in Vietnam after the Fall of Saigon. Following his release in 1992, he lived in exile in the United States.

==Early life==
Nguyễn was born in Quảng Nam Province, Vietnam on 16 February 1924. He graduated Sorbonne Law School in Paris, France.

As a writer, he penned works in both Vietnamese and French, which included 20 novels, 2 plays and several poems. In 1966, he was declared the winner of the World Literary Prize for his French language short stories.

During the era of the Republic of Vietnam, he served as an attorney for the Superior Appellate Court in Saigon.

==Political activity and imprisonment==
Nguyễn was a member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. A devout anti-communist, he chose to remain during the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, and he formed the People&#x27;s Forces For the Recovery of Vietnam. In 1975, he was the Judicial Advisor to the Saint Vincent Church Uprising, Saigon. This led to his arrest by the Vietnamese Communists on 27 December, and he received a life sentence. During his imprisonment, he was allegedly tortured and spent several years in solitary confinement. When asked how he survived for so long in prison, Nguyen stated &quot;I composed music and wrote poems and stored them in here [pointing at his head]&quot;.

Under political pressure from the United States Department of State, the French Government and PEN International, Nguyễn was released by the Vietnamese Government after seventeen years in jail. He was granted political asylum, and reunited with his family at Dulles International Airport on 3 March 1992, before living with them in Maryland.

==Life in exile==
In 1996, he joined the exiled anti-communist organization, the Government of Free Vietnam, and served as its Minister of Information.

On 15 August 1997, Nguyễn founded the Free Vietnam Coalition Party, and in June 2002, he was chosen as Chairman of the Vietnamese Nationals Council.

Nguyễn latterly lived in Silver Spring, Maryland. He was later diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which had become terminal by 2015. He died on 24 September 2016, at the age of 92.

<doc id="1270878" wikidata="Q3278217" url="?curid=1270878" title="Acid-fastness">
<text>Acid-fastness is a physical property of certain bacterial and eukaryotic cells, as well as some sub-cellular structures, specifically their resistance to decolorization by acids during laboratory staining procedures. Once stained as part of a sample, these organisms can resist the acid and/or ethanol-based decolorization procedures common in many staining protocols, hence the name &quot;acid-fast&quot;.

The mechanisms of acid-fastness vary by species although the most well-known example is in the genus &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;, which includes the species responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy. The acid-fastness of &quot;Mycobacteria&quot; is due to the high mycolic acid content of their cell walls, which is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. Some bacteria may also be partially acid-fast, such as &quot;Nocardia&quot;.

Acid-fast organisms are difficult to characterize using standard microbiological techniques, though they can be stained using concentrated dyes, particularly when the staining process is combined with heat. Some, such as &quot;Mycobacteria&quot;, can be stained with the Gram stain, but they do not take the crystal violet well and thus appear light purple, which can still potentially result in an incorrect gram negative identification.

The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl–Neelsen stain, in which the acid-fast species are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background. Another method is the Kinyoun method, in which the bacteria are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a green background. Acid-fast &quot;Mycobacteria&quot; can also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent dyes (auramine-rhodamine stain, for example).

==Some acid-fast staining techniques==
* Ziehl–Neelsen stain (classic and modified bleach types)
* Kinyoun stain
* For color blind people (or in backgrounds where detecting red bacteria is difficult), Victoria blue can be substituted for carbol fuchsin and picric acid can be used as the counter stain instead of methylene blue, and the rest of the Kinyoun technique can be used.
** Various bacterial spore staining techniques using Kenyon e.g.
*** Moeller&#x27;s method
*** Dorner&#x27;s method (acid alcohol decolorizer) without the Schaeffer–Fulton modification (decolorize by water)
*** Detergent method, using Tergitol 7, nonionic polyglycol ether surfactants type NP-7 
* Fite stain
** Fite-Faraco stain
** Wade Fite stain
* Ellis and Zabrowarny stain (no phenol/carbolic acid)
* Auramine-rhodamine stain
* Auramine phenol stain

==Notable acid-fast structures==

Very few structures are acid-fast; this makes staining for acid-fastness particularly useful in diagnosis. The following are notable examples of structures which are acid-fast or modified acid-fast:
* All Mycobacteria – &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, &quot;M. leprae&quot;, &quot;M. smegmatis&quot; and atypical mycobacteria&quot;.&quot;
* Certain Actinobacteria (especially aerobic ones in the order Mycobacteriales) with mycolic acid in their cell wall; not to be confused with &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, which is a non-acid-fast genus of actinomycete. Note that &quot;Streptomyces&quot; do not contain mycolic acid.
** &quot;Nocardia&quot; (weakly acid-fast; resists decolorization with weaker acid concentrations)
** &quot;Rhodococcus&quot;
** &quot;Gordonia&quot;
** &quot;Tsukamurella&quot;
** &quot;Dietzia&quot;
* Head of sperm
* Bacterial spores, see Endospore
* &quot;Legionella micdadei&quot;
* Certain cellular inclusions e.g.
** Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies seen in
*** Neurons in layer 5 of cerebral cortex neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease).
** Nuclear inclusion bodies seen in
*** Lead poisoning
*** Bismuth poisoning.
* Oocysts of some coccidian parasites in faecal matter, such as:
** &quot;Cryptosporidium parvum&quot;,
** &quot;Isospora belli&quot;
** &quot;Cyclospora cayetanensis&quot;.
* A few other parasites:
** &quot;Sarcocystis&quot;
** &quot;Taenia saginata&quot; eggs stain well but &quot;Taenia solium&quot; eggs don&#x27;t (can be used to distinguish)
** Hydatid cysts, especially their &quot;hooklets&quot; stain irregularly with ZN stain but emanate bright red fluorescence under green light, and can aid detection in moderately heavy backgrounds or with scarce hooklets.
* Fungal yeast forms are inconsistently stained with Acid-fast stain which is considered a narrow spectrum stain for fungi. In a study on acid-fastness of fungi, 60% of blastomyces and 47% of histoplasma showed positive cytoplasmic staining of the yeast-like cells, and Cryptococcus or candida did not stain, and very rare staining was seen in Coccidioides endospores.

<doc id="1270879" wikidata="Q3125170" url="?curid=1270879" title="Pan-Celticism">
<text>Pan-Celticism (, Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Pan-Cheilteachas&quot;, Breton: &quot;Pan-Keltaidd&quot;, Welsh: &quot;Pan-Geltaidd&quot;, Cornish: &quot;Pan-Keltaidh&quot;, Manx: &quot;Pan-Cheltaghys&quot;), also known as Celticism or Celtic nationalism, is a political, social and cultural movement advocating solidarity and cooperation between Celtic nations (both the Brythonic and Gaelic branches) and the modern Celts in Northwestern Europe. Some pan-Celtic organisations advocate the Celtic nations seceding from the United Kingdom and France and forming their own separate federal state together, while others simply advocate very close cooperation between independent sovereign Celtic nations, in the form of Breton, Cornish, Irish, Manx, Scottish, and Welsh nationalism.

Just like other pan-nationalist movements, the pan-Celtic movement grew out of Romantic nationalism and specific to itself, the Celtic Revival. The pan-Celtic movement was most prominent during the 19th and 20th centuries (roughly 1838 until 1939). Some early pan-Celtic contacts took place through the Gorsedd and the Eisteddfod, while the annual Celtic Congress was initiated in 1900. Since that time the Celtic League has become the prominent face of political pan-Celticism. Initiatives largely focused on cultural Celtic cooperation, rather than explicitly politics, such as music, arts and literature festivals, are usually referred to instead as &quot;inter-Celtic&quot;.

==Terminology==
There is some controversy surrounding the term Celts. One such example was the Celtic League&#x27;s &quot;Galician crisis&quot;. This was a debate over whether the Spanish region of Galicia should be admitted. The application was rejected on the basis of a lack of a presence of a Celtic language.

Some Austrians claim that they have a Celtic heritage that became Romanized under Roman rule and later Germanized after Germanic invasions. Austria is the location of the first characteristically Celtic culture to exist. After the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, in October 1940 a writer from the &quot;Irish Press&quot; interviewed Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger who spoke of Celtic heritage of Austrians, saying &quot;I believe there is a deeper connection between us Austrians and the Celts. Names of places in the Austrian Alps are said to be of Celtic origin.&quot; Contemporary Austrians express pride in having Celtic heritage and Austria possesses one of the largest collections of Celtic artefacts in Europe.

Organisations such as the Celtic Congress and the Celtic League use the definition that a &#x27;Celtic nation&#x27; is a nation with recent history of a traditional Celtic language.

==History==
===Modern conception of the Celtic peoples===


Before the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity, people lived in Iron Age Britain and Ireland, speaking languages from which the modern Gaelic languages (including Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) and Brythonic languages (including Welsh, Breton and Cornish) descend. These people, along with others in Continental Europe who once spoke now extinct languages from the same Indo-European branch (such as the Gauls, Celtiberians and Galatians), have been retroactively referred to in a collective sense as the Celts, particularly in a wide spread manner since the turn of the 18th century. Variations of the term &quot;Celt&quot;, such as &quot;Keltoi&quot;, had been used in antiquity by the Greeks and the Romans to refer to some groups of these people, such as Herodotus&#x27; use of it in regards to the Gauls.

The modern usage of &quot;Celt&quot; in reference to these cultures grew up gradually. A pioneer in the field was George Buchanan, a 16th-century Scottish scholar, Renaissance humanist and tutor to king James IV of Scotland. From a Scottish Gaelic-speaking family, Buchanan in his &quot;Rerum Scoticarum Historia&quot; (1582), went over the writings of Tacitus who had discussed the similarity between the language of the Gauls and the ancient Britons. Buchanan concluded, if the Gauls were &quot;Celtae&quot;, as they were described as in Roman sources, then the Britons were &quot;Celtae&quot; too. He began to see a pattern in place names and concluded that the Britons and Irish Gaels once spoke one Celtic language which later diverged. It wouldn&#x27;t be until over a century later when these ideas were widely popularised; first by the Breton scholar Paul-Yves Pezron in his &quot;Antiquité de la Nation et de la langue celtes autrement appelez Gaulois&quot; (1703) and then by the Welsh scholar Edward Lhuyd in his &quot;Archaeologia Britannica: An Account of the Languages, Histories and Customs of the Original Inhabitants of Great Britain&quot; (1707).

By the time the modern concept of the Celts as a people had emerged, their fortunes had declined substantially, taken over by Germanic people. Firstly, the Celtic Britons of sub-Roman Britain were swamped by a tide of Anglo-Saxon settlement from the fifth century on and lost most of their territory to them. They were subsequently referred to as the Welsh people and the Cornish people. A group of these fled Britain altogether and settled in Continental Europe in Armorica, becoming the Breton people. The Gaels for a while actually expanded, pushing out of Ireland to conquer Pictland in Britain, establishing Alba by the ninth century. From the 11th century onward, the arrival of the Normans, caused problems not only for the English but also for the Celts. The Normans invaded the Welsh kingdoms (establishing the Principality of Wales), the Irish kingdoms (establishing the Lordship of Ireland) and took control of the Scottish monarchy through intermarrying. This advance was often done in conjunction with the Catholic Church&#x27;s Gregorian Reform, which was centralising the religion in Europe.

The dawning of early modern Europe affected the Celtic peoples in ways which saw what small amount of independence they had left firmly subordinated to the emerging British Empire and in the case of the Duchy of Brittany, the Kingdom of France. Although both the Kings of England (the Tudors) and the Kings of Scotland (the Stewarts) of the day claimed Celtic ancestry and used this in Arthurian cultural motifs to lay the basis for a British monarchy (&quot;British&quot; being suggested by Elizabethan John Dee), both dynasties promoted a centralising policy of Anglicisation. The Gaels of Ireland lost their last kingdoms to the Kingdom of Ireland after the Flight of the Earls in 1607, while the Statutes of Iona attempted to de-Gaelicise the Highland Scots in 1609. The effects of these initiates were mixed, but took from the Gaels their natural leadership element, which had patronised their culture.

Under Anglocentric British rule, the Celtic-speaking peoples were reduced to a marginalised, largely poor people, small farmers and fishermen, clinging to the coast of the North Atlantic. Following the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, greater multitudes were Anglicised and fled into a diaspora around the British Empire as an industrial proletariat. Further de-Gaelicisation took place for the Irish during the Great Hunger and the Highland Scots during the Highland Clearances. Similarly for the Bretons, after the French Revolution, the Jacobins demanded greater centralisation, against regional identities and for Francization, enacted by the French Directory in 1794. However, Napoleon Bonaparte was greatly attracted to the romantic image of the Celt, which was partly based on Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s glorification of the noble savage and the popularity of James Macpherson&#x27;s Ossianic tales throughout Europe. Bonaparte&#x27;s nephew, Napoleon III, would later have the Vercingétorix monument erected to honour the Celtic Gaulish leader. Indeed, in France the phrase &quot;nos ancêtres les Gaulois&quot; (our ancestors the Gauls) was invoked by Romantic nationalists, typically in a republican fashion, to refer to the majority of the people, contrary to the aristocracy (claimed to be of Frankish-Germanic descent).

===Dawning of Pan-Celticism as a political idea===
Following the dying down of Jacobitism as a political threat in Britain and Ireland, with the firm establishment of Hanoverian Britain under the liberal, rationalist philosophy of the Enlightenment, a backlash of Romanticism in the late 18th century occurred and &quot;the Celt&quot; was rehabilitated in literature, in a movement which is sometimes known as &quot;Celtomania.&quot; The most prominent native representatives of the initial stages of this Celtic Revival were James Macpherson, author of the &quot;Poems of Ossian&quot; (1761) and Iolo Morganwg, founder of the &quot;Gorsedd&quot;. The imagery of the &quot;Celtic World&quot; also inspired English and Lowland Scots poets such as Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley and Scott. In particular the Druids inspired fascination for outsiders, as English and French antiquarians, such as William Stukeley, John Aubrey, Théophile Corret de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne and Jacques Cambry, began to associate ancient megaliths and dolmens with the Druids.

In the 1820s, early pan-Celtic contacts began to develop, firstly between the Welsh and the Bretons, as Thomas Price and Jean-François Le Gonidec worked together to translate the New Testament into Breton. The two men were champions of their respective languages and both highly influential in their own countries. It was in this spirit that a Pan-Celtic Congress took place at the &quot;Cymreigyddion y Fenni&quot;&#x27;s annual &quot;Eisteddfod&quot; in Abergavenny in 1838, where Bretons attended. Among these participants was Théodore Hersart de La Villemarqué, author of the Macpherson-Morganwg influenced &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot;, who imported the &quot;Gorsedd&quot; idea into Brittany. Indeed, the Breton nationalists would be the most enthusiastic pan-Celticists, acting as a lynch-pin between the different parts; &quot;trapped&quot; within another state (France), this allowed them to draw strength from kindred peoples across the Channel and they also shared a strong attachment to the Catholic faith with the Irish.

Across Europe, modern Celtic Studies were developing as an academic discipline. The Germans led the way in the field with Indo-European linguist Franz Bopp in 1838, followed up by Johann Kaspar Zeuss&#x27; &quot;Grammatica Celtica&quot; (1853). Indeed, as German power was growing in rivalry with France and England, the Celtic Question was of interest to them and they were able to perceive the shift towards Celtic-based nationalisms. Heinrich Zimmer, the Professor of Celtic at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (predecessor of Kuno Meyer), spoke in 1899 of the powerful agitation in the &quot;Celtic fringe of the United Kingdom&#x27;s rich overcoat&quot; and predicted that pan-Celticism would become a political force as important to the future of European politics as the much more established movements of pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism. Other academic treatments included Ernest Renan&#x27;s &quot;La Poésie des races celtiques&quot; (1854) and Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;The Study of Celtic Literature&quot; (1867). The attention given by Arnold was a double-edged sword; he lauded Celtic poetic and musical achievements, but effeminised them and suggested they needed the cement of a sober, orderly Anglo-Saxon rule.

A concept arose among some European philologists, particularly articulated by Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, whereby the &quot;care of the national language is a sacred trust&quot;, or put more simply, &quot;no language, no nation.&quot; This dictum was also adopted by nationalists in Celtic nations, particularly Thomas Davis of the Young Ireland movement, who, contrary to the earlier Catholic-based &quot;civic rights&quot; activism of a Daniel O&#x27;Connell, asserted an Irish nationalism where the Irish language would become hegemonic once again. As he claimed a &quot;people without a language of its own is only half a nation.&quot; In a less explicitly political context, language revivalist groups emerged such as the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language, which would later become the Gaelic League. In a Pan-Celtic context, Charles de Gaulle (uncle of the more famous General Charles de Gaulle), who involved himself in Breton autonomism and advocated for a Celtic Union in 1864, argued that &quot;so long as a conquered people speaks another language than their conquers, the best part of them remains free.&quot; De Gaulle corresponded with people in Brittany, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, arguing that each needed to cooperate in a spirit of Celtic unity and above all defend their native languages or otherwise their position as Celtic nations would be extinct. A Pan-Celtic review was founded by de Gaulle&#x27;s comrade Henri Gaidoz in 1873, known as &quot;Revue Celtique&quot;.

In 1867 de Gaulle organised the first ever Pan-Celtic gathering in Saint-Brieuc, Brittany. No Irish attended and the guests were mainly Welsh and Breton.

T. E. Ellis, the leader of Cymru Fydd was a proponent of Pan-Celticism, stating &quot;We must work for bringing together Celtic reformers and Celtic peoples. The interests of Irishmen, Welshmen and [Scottish] Crofters are almost identical. Their past history is very similar, their present oppressors are the same and their immediate wants are the same.

===Pan-Celtic Congress and the Celtic Association era===
The first major Pan-Celtic Congress was organised by Edmund Edward Fournier d&#x27;Albe and Bernard FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown, under the auspices of their Celtic Association and was held in August 1901 in Dublin. This had followed on from an earlier sentiment of pan-Celtic feeling at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, held in Liverpool in 1900. Another influence was Fournier&#x27;s attendance at &quot;Feis Ceoil&quot; in the late 1890s, which drew musicians from the different Celtic nations. The two leaders formed somewhat of an idiosyncratic pair; Fournier, of French parentage, embraced an ardent Hibernophilia and learned the Irish language, while FitzPatrick descended from ancient Irish royalty (the Mac Giolla Phádraig of Osraige), but was serving in the British Army and had earlier been a Conservative MP (indeed, the original Pan-Celtic Congress was delayed for a year because of the Second Boer War). The main intellectual organ of the Celtic Association was &quot;Celtia: A Pan-Celtic Monthly Magazine&quot;, edited by Fournier, which ran from January 1901 until 1904 and was briefly revived in 1907 before finally ending for good in May 1908. Its inception was welcomed by Breton François Jaffrennou. An unrelated publication, &quot;The Celtic Review&quot;, was founded in 1904 and ran until 1908.

Historian Justin Dolan Stover of Idaho State University describes the movement as having &quot;uneven successes&quot;.

In total, the Celtic Association was able to organise three Pan-Celtic Congresses: Dublin (1901), Caernarfon (1904) and Edinburgh (1907). Each of these opened with an elaborate neo-druidic ceremony, with the laying of the &quot;Lia Cineil&quot; (&quot;Race Stone&quot;), which drew inspiration from the &quot;Lia Fáil&quot; and Stone of Scone. The stone was five foot high and consisted of five granite blocks, each with a letter of the respective Celtic nation etched into it in their own language (i.e. – &quot;E&quot; for Ireland, &quot;A&quot; for Scotland, &quot;C&quot; for Wales). At the laying of the stone, the Archdruid of the Eisteddfod, Hwfa Môn would say three times in Gaelic, while holding a partly unsheathed sword, &quot;Is there peace?&quot; to which the people responded &quot;Peace.&quot; The symbolism inherent in this was meant to represent a counterpoise to the British Empire&#x27;s assimilating Anglo-Saxonism as articulated by the likes of Rudyard Kipling. For the pan-Celts, they imagined a restored &quot;Celtic race&quot;, but where each Celtic people would have its own national space without assimilating all into a uniformity. The &quot;Lia Cineil&quot; was also intended as a phallic symbol, referencing the ancient megaliths historically associated with the Celts and overturning the &quot;feminisation of the Celts by their Saxon neighbours.&quot;

The response of the most advanced and militant nationalism of a &quot;Celtic&quot; people; Irish nationalism; was mixed. The pan-Celts were lampooned by D. P. Moran in &quot;The Leader&quot;, under the title of &quot;Pan-Celtic Farce&quot;. The folk costumes and druidic aesthetics were especially mocked, meanwhile Moran, who associated Irish nationality with Catholicism, was suspicious of the Protestantism of both Fournier and FitzPatrick. The participation of the latter as a &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot; against the Boers (whom Irish nationalists supported with the Irish Transvaal Brigade) was also highlighted as unsound. Moran concluded that pan-Celticism was &quot;parasitic&quot; from Irish nationalism, created by a &quot;foreigner&quot; (Fournier) and sought to misdirect Irish energies. Others were less polemical; opinion in the Gaelic League was divided and though they elected not to send an official representative, some members did attend Congress meetings (including Douglas Hyde, Patrick Pearse and Michael Davitt). More enthusiastic was Lady Gregory, who imagined an Ireland-led &quot;Pan-Celtic Empire&quot;, while William Butler Yeats also attended the Dublin meeting. Prominent Gaelic League activists such as Pearse, Edward Martyn, John St. Clair Boyd, Thomas William Rolleston, Thomas O&#x27;Neill Russell, Maxwell Henry Close and William Gibson all made financial contributions to the Pan-Celtic Congress. Ruaraidh Erskine was an attendant. Erskine himself was an advocate of a &quot;Gaelic confederation&quot;
between Ireland and Scotland.

David Lloyd George, who would later to go on to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, delivered a speech at the 1904 Celtic Congress.

Breton Regionalist Union founder Régis de l&#x27;Estourbeillon attended the 1907 congress, headed the Breton faction of the procession and placed the Breton stone on the Lia Cineill. Henry Jenner, Arthur William Moore and John Crichton-Stuart, fourth Marquess of Bute likewise attended the 1907 congress.

Erskine made an effort to set up a &quot;union of Welsh, Scots and Irish with a view to action on behalf of Celtic communism&quot;. He wrote to Thomas Gwynn Jones asking for suggestions on Welshmen to invite to London for a meeting on setting such a thing up. It is unknown if such a meeting ever took place.

John de Courcy Mac Donnell founded a Celtic Union in Belgium in 1908, which organised the fourth Pan-Celtic congress as part of the 1910 Brussels International Exposition. Exhibitions of hurling were held there and at nearby at Fontenoy, commemorating the Irish Brigade at the 1745 battle. The Celtic Union held further events up to the fifth Pan-Celtic congress 1913 in Ghent/Brussels/Namur.

In Paris, 1912, the &quot;La Ligue Celtique Française&quot; was launched and had a magazine called &quot;La Poétique&quot;, which published news and literature from all around the Celtic world.

===Pan-Celticism after the Easter Rising===
Celtic nationalisms were boosted immensely by the Irish Easter Rising of 1916, where a group of revolutionaries belonging to the Irish Republican Brotherhood struck militantly against the British Empire during World War I to assert an Irish Republic. Part of their political vision, building on earlier Irish-Ireland policies was a re-Gaelicisation of Ireland: that is to say a de-colonisation of Anglo cultural, linguistic and economic hegemony and a re-assertion of the native Celtic culture. After the initial rising, their politics coalesced in Ireland around Sinn Féin. In other Celtic nations, groups were founded holding similar views and voiced solidarity with Ireland during the Irish War of Independence: this included the Breton-journal &quot;Breiz Atao&quot;, the Scots National League of Ruaraidh Erskine and various figures in Wales who would later go on to found &quot;Plaid Cymru&quot;. The presence of James Connolly and the October Revolution in Russia taking place at the same time, also led some to imagine a Celtic socialism or communism; an idea associated with Erskine, as well as the revolutionary John Maclean and William Gillies. Erskine claimed the &quot;collectivist ethos in the Celtic past&quot;, had been, &quot;undermined by Anglo-Saxon values of greed and selfishness.&quot;

The hope of some Celtic nationalists that a semi-independent Ireland could act as a springboard for Irish Republican Army-esque equivalents for their own nations and the &quot;liberation&quot; of the rest of the Celtosphere would prove a disappointment. A militant Scottish volunteer force founded by Gillies, &quot;Fianna na hAlba&quot;; which like the &quot;Óglaigh na hÉireann&quot; advocated republicanism and Gaelic nationalism; was discouraged by Michael Collins who advised Gillies that the British state was stronger in Scotland than Ireland and that public opinion was more against them. Once the Irish Free State was established, the ruling parties; Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil; were content to engage in inter-governmental diplomacy with the British state in an effort to have returned the counties in Northern Ireland, rather than supporting Celtic nationalist militants within Britain. The Irish state, particularly under Éamon de Valera did make some effort on the cultural and linguistic front in regards to Pan-Celticism. For instance in the summer of 1947, the Irish Taoiseach de Valera visited the Isle of Man and met with Manxman, Ned Maddrell. While there he had the Irish Folklore Commission make recordings of the last, old, native Manx Gaelic-speakers, including Maddrell.

===Post-war initiatives and the Celtic League===
A group called &quot;Aontacht na gCeilteach&quot; (Celtic Unity) was set up to promote the pan-Celtic vision in November 1942. It was headed by Éamonn Mac Murchadha. MI5 believed it to be a secret front for the Irish fascist party Ailtiri na hAiseirghe and was to serve as &quot;a rallying point for Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Breton nationalists&quot;. The group had the same postal address as the party. At its foundation the group stated that &quot;the present system is utterly repugnant to the celtic conception of life&quot; and called for a new order based upon a &quot;distinctive celtic philosophy&quot;. Ailtiri na hAiseirghe itself had a pan-Celtic vision and had established contacts with pro-Welsh independence political party Plaid Cymru and Scottish independence activist Wendy Wood. One day the party covered South Dublin city with posters saying &quot;Rhyddid i Gymru&quot; (Freedom for Wales) Rhisiart Tal-e-bot, former President of the European Free Alliance Youth is a member.

The rejuvenation of Irish republicanism during the post-war period and into The Troubles had some inspiration not only for other Celtic nationalists, but militant nationalists from other &quot;small nations&quot;, such as the Basques with the ETA. Indeed, this was particularly pertinent to the secessionist nationalisms of Spain, as the era of Francoist Spain was coming to a close. As well as this, there was renewed interest in all things Celtic in the 1960s and 1970s. In a less militant fashion, elements within Galician nationalism and Asturian nationalism began to court Pan-Celticism, attending the &quot;Festival Interceltique de Lorient&quot; and the Pan Celtic Festival at Killarney, as well as joining the International Section of the Celtic League. Although this region had once been under Iberian Celts, had a strong resonance in Gaelic mythology (i.e. – Breogán) and even during the Early Middle Ages had a small enclave of Celtic Briton emigrants at Britonia (similar to the case with Brittany), no Celtic language had been spoken there since the eighth century and today they speak Romance languages. During the so-called &quot;Galician crisis&quot; of 1986, the Galicians were admitted to the Celtic League as a Celtic nation (Paul Mosson had argued for their inclusion in &quot;Carn&quot; since 1980). This was subsequently overturned the following year, as the Celtic League reaffirmed the Celtic languages as the integral and defining factor in what is a Celtic nation.

=== 21st century ===

Following the Brexit referendum there were calls for Pan-Celtic Unity. In November 2016, the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon stated the idea of a &quot;Celtic Corridor&quot; of the island of Ireland and Scotland appealed to her.

In January 2019 the leader of the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru party, Adam Price spoke in favour of cooperation among the Celtic nations of Britain and Ireland following Brexit. Among his proposals were a Celtic Development Bank for joint infrastructure and investment projects in energy, transport and communications in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the Isle of Man, and the foundation of a Celtic union, the structure of which is already existent in the Good Friday Agreement according to Price. Speaking to RTÉ, the Irish national broadcaster he proposed Wales and Ireland working together to promote the indigenous languages of each nation.

Blogger Owen Donavan published, on his blog &quot;State of Wales&quot;, his views on a Celtic confederation, &quot;a voluntary union of sovereign nation-states – between Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The Isle of Man would presumably be a candidate for inclusion too. Cornwall and Brittany could be added as future members if they can attain a measure of self-government.&quot; He also considered a Celtic Council, a similar co-operation that was proposed by Adam Price. Journalist Jamie Dalgety has also proposed the concept of a Celtic Union involving Scotland and Ireland but suggests that lack of support for Welsh independence may mean that a Gaelic Celtic Union involving may be more appropriate. Bangor University lecturer and journalist, Ifan Morgan Jones has suggested that &quot;a short-term fix for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland might be a greater degree of cooperation with each other, as a union within a union.&quot; he also suggested that &quot;If they could find a way of working together in their mutual interest, that’s a fair degree of combined influence, particular if the next General Election produces a hung parliament.&quot;

==Anti-Celticism==
A movement among some archeologists known as &quot;Celtoscepticism&quot; emerged from the late 1980s, through the 1990s. This school of thought, initiated by John Collis sought to undermine the basis of Celticism and cast doubts on the legitimacy of the very concept or any usage of the term &quot;Celts&quot;. This strain of thought was particularly hostile to all but archaeological evidence. Partly a reaction to the rise in Celtic devolutionist tendencies, these scholars were opposed to describing the Iron Age people of Britain as Celtic Britons and even disliked the use of the phrase Celtic in describing the Celtic language family. Collis, an Englishman from the University of Cambridge, was hostile to the methodology of German professor Gustaf Kossinna and was hostile to Celts as an ethnic identity coalescing around a concept of hereditary ancestry, culture and language (claiming this was &quot;racist&quot;). Aside from this Collis was hostile to the use of Classical literature and Irish literature as a source for the Iron Age period, as exemplified by Celtic scholars such as Barry Cunliffe. Throughout the duration of the debate on the historicity of the ancient Celts, John T. Koch stated that it is &quot;the scientific fact of a Celtic family of languages that has weathered unscathed the Celtosceptic controversy.&quot;

Collis was not the only figure in this field. The two other figures most prominent in the field were Malcolm Chapman with his &quot;The Celts: The Construction of a Myth&quot; (1992) and Simon James of the University of Leicester with his &quot;The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention?&quot; (1999). In particular, James engaged in a particularly heated exchange with Vincent Megaw (and his wife Ruth) on the pages of &quot;Antiquity&quot;. The Megaws (along with others such as Peter Berresford Ellis) suspected a politically motivated agenda; driven by English nationalist resentment and anxiety at British Imperial decline; in the whole premise of Celtosceptic theorists (such as Chapman, Nick Merriman and J. D. Hill) and that the anti-Celtic position was a reaction to the formation of a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. For his part, James stepped forward to defend his fellow Celtosceptics, claiming that their rejection of the Celtic idea was politically motivated, but invoked &quot;multiculturalism&quot; and sought to deconstruct the past and imagine it as more &quot;diverse&quot;, rather than a Celtic uniformity.

Attempts to identify a distinct Celtic Race were made by the &quot;Harvard Archaeological Mission to Ireland&quot; in the 1930s, led by Earnest Hooton, which drew the conclusions needed by its sponsor-government. The findings were vague and did not stand up to scrutiny, and were not pursued after 1945. The genetic studies by David Reich suggest that the Celtic areas had three major population changes, and that the last group in the Iron Age, who spoke Celtic languages, had arrived in about 1000 BCE, after the building of iconic supposedly-Celtic monuments like Stonehenge and Newgrange. Reich confirmed that the Indo-European root of the Celtic languages reflected a population shift, and was not just a linguistic adoption.

==Manifestations==
Pan-Celticism can operate on one or all of the following levels listed below:

===Linguistics===
Linguistic organisations promote linguistic ties, notably the Gorsedd in Wales, Cornwall and Brittany, and the Irish government-sponsored Columba Initiative between Ireland and Scotland. Often, there is a split here between the Irish, Scots and Manx, who use Q-Celtic Goidelic languages, and the Welsh, Cornish and Bretons, who speak P-Celtic Brythonic languages.

===Music===

Music is a notable aspect of Celtic cultural links. Inter-Celtic festivals have been gaining popularity, and some of the most notable include those at Lorient, Ortigueira, Killarney, Kilkenny, Letterkenny and Celtic Connections in Glasgow.

===Sports===
====Wrestling====
There are similarities across Celtic wrestling styles, with many commentators suggesting that this indicates they stem from a common style.

In the Middle Ages it is known that the &quot;champions from the Emerald Isle (the Green Island or Ireland) met the Cornish regularly to wrestle&quot;. The Irish style is known as Collar-and-elbow wrestling and uses a &quot;jacket&quot; as does Cornish wrestling. This was still true in the 1800s when Irish champions regularly came to London to wrestle Cornish and Devonian champions.

Cornwall and Brittany have similar wrestling styles (Cornish wrestling and Gouren respectively). There have been matches between wrestlers in these styles over centuries. For example, in 1551 between Cornish soldiers, involved with Edward VI&#x27;s investing Henri II with the Order of the Garter, and Breton &quot;farmers&quot;. There is folklore that fishing disputes between Cornish and Breton fishermen were settled with wrestling matches.

More formally Inter-Celtic championships between Cornwall and Brittany started in 1928, but became less frequent since the 1980s.

The Celtic wrestling championship started in 1985 comprising Gouren and Scottish Backhold or Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling and sometimes other styles such as Cornish wrestling.

Teams that have competed in the Celtic wrestling championship include:
* Brittany
* Canaries
* Cornwall
* England
* Fryslan
* Iceland
* Ireland
* Leon
* Salzburg
* Sardinia
* Scotland
* Sweden

====Hurling and Shinty====
Ireland and Scotland play each other at hurling/shinty internationals.

====Handball====
As with Hurling and Shinty, Irish handball and Welsh handball () share an ancient Celtic origin, but over the centuries they developed into two separate sports with different rules and international organisations.

Informal inter-Celtic matches were very likely a feature of industrial southern Wales in the nineteenth century, with Irish immigrant workers said to have enjoyed playing the Welsh game. However, attempts to play formal inter-Celtic matches would only begin after the formation of The Welsh Handball Association in 1987. The association was tasked with playing international matches against nations with similar sports such as Ireland, USA (American Handball) and England (Fives). To facilitate international competition, a new set of rules were devised, and even Wales&#x27; most famous Pêl-Law court (The Nelson Court) was given new markings, more in-keeping with the Irish game.

Meaningful Welsh-Irish matches finally became a reality in October 1994, with &quot;The One Wall World Championships&quot; held in Dublin and an inaugural &quot;European One Wall Handball Tournament&quot; held at three courts across southern Wales the following May. The 1990s were the high point for these inter-Celtic rivalries. The success of Wales&#x27; Lee Davies (World Champion in 1997) saw large crowds and high public interest. In recent years however, the decline of handball in Wales has resulted in little interest in inter-Celtic competition.

====Rugby====

A Pan-Celtic rugby tournament had been the subject of intermittent discussions throughout the early years of professionalism. The first material steps toward a Pan-Celtic league were taken in the 1999–2000 season, when the Scottish districts Edinburgh and Glasgow were invited to join the fully professional Welsh Premier Division, creating the Welsh–Scottish League. In 2001, the four provinces of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) joined, with the new format being named the Celtic League.

Today, the tournament is known as the United Rugby Championship, and has since expanded into Italy and South Africa, with no plans for expansion into the other Celtic nations. However, inter-Celtic rivalries continue within the league, under the legal name of the body running the competition &quot;Celtic Rugby DAC&quot;.

In Women&#x27;s rugby union, The IRFU, WRU and SRU established the Celtic Challenge competition in 2023. While the first tournament was contested by one team from each nation (Combined Provinces XV, Welsh Development XV and the Thistles), it is hoped that the tournament will expand to six competing teams (two from each union) in 2024, with further expansions planned over the next 3 to 5 years.

===Political===
Political groups such as the Celtic League, along with Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party have co-operated at some levels in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and Plaid Cymru has asked questions in Parliament about Cornwall and cooperates with Mebyon Kernow. The Regional Council of Brittany, the governing body of the Region of Brittany, has developed formal cultural links with the Welsh Senedd and there are fact-finding missions. Political pan-Celticism can be taken to include everything from a full federation of independent Celtic states, to occasional political visits. During the Troubles, the Provisional IRA adopted a policy of not mounting attacks in Scotland and Wales, as they viewed England alone as the colonial force occupying Ireland. This was also possibly influenced by the IRA chief of staff Seán Mac Stíofáin (John Stephenson), a London-born republican with pan-Celtic views.

In 2023 a &#x27;Celtic Forum&#x27; took place in Brittany. Attendees included First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford, Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Shona Robinson, Leader of the Cornwall Council, Linda Taylor, Republic of Ireland Ambassador to France, Niall Burgess and Loïg Chesnais-Girard, the President of the Regional Council of Brittany. Political representatives from Asturias and Galicia were also present. Drakeford described the forum as &quot;an excellent opportunity to come together as Celtic nations and regions, to build on our cultural and historical links and seek out areas for future collaboration, such as marine energy.&quot;

===Town twinnings===
Town twinning is common between Wales – Brittany and Ireland – Brittany, covering hundreds of communities, with exchanges of local politicians, choirs, dancers and school groups.

==Historical connections==
The kingdom of Dál Riata was a Gaelic overkingdom on the western seaboard of Scotland with some territory on the northern coasts of Ireland. In the late sixth and early seventh century it encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland and also County Antrim in Northern Ireland.

As recently as the 13th century, &quot;members of the Scottish elite were still proud to proclaim their Gaelic-Irish origins and identified Ireland as the homeland of the Scots.&quot; The 14th century Scottish King Robert the Bruce asserted a common identity for Ireland and Scotland. However, in later medieval times, Irish and Scottish interests diverged for a number of reasons, and the two peoples grew estranged. The conversion of the Scots to Protestantism was one factor. The stronger political position of Scotland in relation to England was another. The disparate economic fortunes of the two was a third reason; by the 1840s Scotland was one of the richest areas in the world and Ireland one of the poorest.

Over the centuries there was considerable migration between Ireland and Scotland, primarily as Scots Protestants took part in the plantation of Ulster in the 17th century and then later, as many Irish began to be evicted from their homes, some emigrating to Scottish cities in the 19th century to escape the &quot;Irish famine&quot;. Recently the field of Irish-Scottish studies has developed considerably, with the Irish-Scottish Academic Initiative (ISAI) founded in 1995. To date, three international conferences have been held in Ireland and Scotland, in 1997, 2000 and 2002.

==Organisations==
*The International Celtic Congress is a non-political cultural organisation that promotes the Celtic language in the six nations of Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, Wales, Isle of Man and Cornwall.
*The Celtic League, is a Pan-Celtic political organization.

==Celtic regions/countries==

A number of Europeans from the central and western regions of the continent have some Celtic ancestry. As such it is generally claimed that the &#x27;litmus test&#x27; of Celticism is a surviving Celtic language and it was on this criterion that the Celtic league rejected Galicia. The following regions have a surviving Celtic language and it on this criterion that they are considered, by The Pan Celtic Congress in 1904 and Celtic League, to be the Celtic nations.

*Brittany
*Cornwall
*Ireland 
*Isle of Man
*Scotland 
*Wales

Other regions with Celtic heritage are:
*Austria – Within the famous Hallstatt cultural region – possible home of the Celts.
*Czech Republic – Home of the Boii (Boiohaemum – Bohemia)
*England
**Cumbria
**Devon
*Faroe Islands
*France – Known previously, in classical times, as Gallia/Gaul. Classical writings on Gaul and its native Celtic tribes are the most extensive literature we have from the time.
*Northern Italy, known as Cisalpine Gaul, was inhabited by populations of Celtic lineage.
*Portugal – Home to the Lusitani, Gallaecian, Turdetani and other Celtic tribes.
*Spain – A large portion of the Iberian peninsula was inhabited by Celtic tribes. Spain and Portugal has been hypothesized as the place of origin of the Celts by Professor John Koch, of the University of Wales.
**Asturias – the principality of Asturias was named after the Astur Celtic tribe.
**Cantabria – The current autonomous community (former duchy) was named after the Cantabri tribe.
**Galicia (with North Portugal) – together as Gallaecia
**Castile and León
**Castilla–La Mancha
**Extremadura
**Community of Madrid
**Andalusia (Turdetani and other tribes)
*Slovenia Historical part of Celtic Kingdom of Noricum

==Celts outside Europe==

===Areas with a Celtic language speaking population===

There are notable Irish and Scottish Gaelic speaking enclaves in Atlantic Canada.

The Patagonia region of Argentina has a sizeable Welsh speaking population. The Welsh settlement in Argentina started in 1865 and is known as Y Wladfa.

===The Celtic diaspora===
The Celtic diaspora in the Americas, as well as New Zealand and Australia, is significant and organised enough that there are numerous organisations, cultural festivals and university-level language classes available in major cities throughout these regions. In the United States, Celtic Family Magazine is a nationally distributed publication providing news, art, and history on Celtic people and their descendants.

The Irish Gaelic games of Gaelic football and hurling are played across the world and are organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association while the Scottish game shinty has seen recent growth in the United States.

==Timeline of Pan-Celticism==
J.T. Koch observes that modern Pan-Celticism arose in the contest of European romantic pan-nationalism, and like other pan-nationist movements, flourished mainly before the First World War. He sees twentieth century efforts in this regard as possibly arising out of a post-modern search for identity in the face of increased industrialization, urbanization and technology.

<text>Baldwin the Eagle, an anthropomorphized bald eagle, is the mascot of the Boston College Eagles.

The nickname &quot;Eagles&quot; goes back to 1920 when Rev. Edward McLaughlin, unhappy at seeing a newspaper cartoon which represented Boston College as a cat after a track victory, wrote to the college newspaper &quot;The Heights&quot;:

==Costumed mascot==
By the time Margo (BC&#x27;s live eagle mascot) died in 1966, eagles had become endangered species and the university then opted to go to a costumed mascot. In 2000, with the unveiling of the current athletics logos, the Boston College Eagle mascot received a visual makeover as well and has appeared that way since. Also, the mascot officially got the name &quot;Baldwin&quot;—a combination of the words &quot;Bald&quot; (as in bald eagle) and &quot;win.&quot; There is also a 9.5 foot inflatable mascot named &quot;Baldwin, Jr.&quot; which appears at games. Like many modern costumed mascots, Baldwin wears replica team uniforms at events.

Baldwin the Eagle is brought to life by an anonymous team of Boston College students that are chosen by audition. They are allowed to reveal their role upon graduation from Boston College.
==Live birds-of-prey==
The &quot;Eagles&quot; nickname stuck. Soon a pair of golden eagles from Texas and New Mexico were given to the college as gifts. However, one escaped and the other broke its beak trying. For the next four years, the official &quot;mascot&quot; was a stuffed golden eagle located in the athletic offices.

In 1961, another attempt was made at a live mascot when the college adopted a 10-month-old golden eagle named &quot;Margo&quot; (so named because the team colors are &quot;mar&quot;oon and &quot;go&quot;ld). Margo lived at the Franklin Park Zoo and was brought to all home games for several years until dying of a virus early in the 1966 season.

In 2013, new athletic director Brad Bates brought back the live eagle tradition, bringing in an eagle during half time of football games. After a fan contest to decide what to call the Eagle, it was named &quot;Welles&quot; after Welles Crowther, the hero who died helping others during the September 11 attacks; a BC alum. Welles made sparing appearances in 2013 and 2014, sometimes not being able to attend the games due to inclement weather, late start times, etc.

==Gilded statue==

Another notable incarnation of the Boston College Eagle is a gilded bronze eagle sculpture that diplomat Larz Anderson and Isabel Weld Perkins, his socialite heiress wife, brought back from Japan in the early 20th century. The eagle remained in Larz Anderson Park until 1954 when it was donated to Boston College and became synonymous with the BC Eagle. It now looks over Linden Lane.

<text>Marooned in Realtime is a 1986 murder mystery and time-travel science fiction novel by American writer Vernor Vinge, about a small, time-displaced group of people who may be the only survivors of a technological singularity or alien invasion. It is the sequel to the novel &quot;The Peace War&quot; (1984) and the novella &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; (1985). Both novels and the novella were collected in &quot;Across Realtime&quot;.

&quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot; won the Prometheus Award in 1987 and was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel that same year.

== Plot summary ==

A bobbler is a device that can create a &quot;bobble&quot;, a spherical stasis field in which time stands still for a specified length of outside time, allowing what is essentially one-way time travel into the future. The bobble can also be used as a weapon, a shield against other weapons, for storage, for space travel (combined with nuclear pulse propulsion), and other purposes.

People whose bobbles burst after a certain date in the 23rd century find the Earth completely devoid of human life, with only ambiguous clues as to the cause; possibilities include alien attack and humanity transcending to a new level of existence as a result of a technological singularity. The &quot;low-techs&quot; — those who bobbled earlier — have roughly late-21st-century technology. The &quot;high-techs&quot; — those who had the advantage of ever accelerating progress — have vastly superior technology, including cybernetic enhancements, faster and thought-controlled bobblers, personal automaton extensions of self, space ships, medical technology to allow practical immortality (barring accidents or fatal injuries), and individual arsenals greater than those of entire 20th century countries. Of the high-techs, even those who bobbled at slightly different times have significantly different technology levels.

The protagonist is Wil Brierson, a detective who is also the protagonist of the preceding novella, &quot;The Ungoverned&quot;. Some time after the events in &quot;The Ungoverned&quot;, Brierson was unwillingly bobbled 10,000 years into the future while he was investigating a routine theft, cutting him off forever from his wife and children.

Yelén and Marta Korolev, a high-tech couple, have spent 50 &quot;megayears&quot; (million years) gathering together all the survivors they can find to rebuild civilization, with the ultimate goal of creating their own technological singularity. They calculate that they will have just enough genetic diversity to keep humanity from going extinct once the bobble containing about a hundred members of the Peace Authority bursts.

When everyone bobbles ahead to the time that particular bobble will burst, and Marta is excluded from the automated bobbling due to the hacking of the Korolevs&#x27; computers. She is left stranded in &quot;realtime&quot;, cut off from all advanced technology. Worse, the hacker extended the duration of the bobbling far beyond what was intended, and Marta dies alone on a deserted Earth. When the &quot;murder&quot; is discovered, Yelén Korolev recruits the low-tech Brierson, the only person with expertise in crime-solving, to find the killer. It has to be one of the seven high-techs (Brierson does not rule out Yelén herself as a suspect).

Della Lu, a high-tech who was an agent of the Peace Authority during &quot;The Peace War&quot;, agrees to assist Brierson with the technical aspects of the case. In the millions of years since the disappearance of humanity, Della had spent most of her 9,000 years alone, exploring the galaxy. She discovered that intelligent life is extremely rare, and there were parallel vanishings in the two long-gone civilizations she found, but no definitive proof of the cause. Singularities are implied to be an explanation for the Fermi Paradox.

The novel thus deals with the investigation of two parallel locked room mysteries: the murder of Marta Korolev, and the &quot;locked planet&quot; mystery of the fate of the human race. Brierson interviews each of the high-techs, seeking evidence of any motive for murder while discussing their views on why the human race vanished. When he makes the killer think he is getting too close, Brierson, Korolev and Della Lu are horrified to discover that &quot;all&quot; of the high-tech systems, except Della&#x27;s, have been taken over. The combined, hijacked forces attack. Della is victorious, but at a ruinous cost: much of their equipment and about half of what remains of humanity are lost. 

Brierson not only unmasks the murderer, he reveals the identity of another monster in their midst. The latter had sabotaged the Korolevs&#x27; medical equipment and a zygote bank, which they had planned to use to repopulate the world. Through skillful maneuvering (and a good deal of luck), Brierson manages to seize the monster&#x27;s own hidden zygote bank and birthing equipment when the latter is forced to flee for his life, making it possible to restore the human race. Korolev devises a novel punishment for the killer.

<text>A quad helix (or quadhelix) is an orthodontic appliance for the upper teeth that is cemented in the mouth. It is attached to the molars by 2 bands and has two or four active helix springs that widen the arch of the mouth to make room for crowded teeth, or correct a posterior cross-bite, where lower teeth are buccal (outer) than upper teeth. It is usually made from 38 mil stainless steel wire and is primarily indicated in mixed dentition, cleft patients and those that have performed the act of thumbsucking. A variety of this appliance is inserted into attachments that are welded to the bands. In this way the orthodontist can adjust the appliance without removing the bands.

The precursor to the quad-helix was the coffin spring. Similar devices known as tri-helices and bi-helices were later developed, with three and two helix springs, respectively.

The expander works by gently pushing the teeth outwards to eventually widen the upper arch. A quad helix expander is usually given to those who have a narrow top jaw, a cross bite and/or crowded teeth.

Organized in 1891 and beginning operations in late 1900, La Electricista was the first electric company to provide electricity to Manila towards the close of the Spanish era. La Electricista had built a central power plant on Calle San Sebastian (now Hidalgo Street) in Quiapo, Manila. On January 17, 1895, its streetlights were turned on for the first time and by 1903, it had about 3,000 electric light customers.

===Founding of the Manila &quot;Electricity&quot;, &quot;Railroad&quot; and &quot;Lighting&quot; Company (MERaLCo)===
On October 20, 1902, during the American Colonial Period, the Second Philippine Commission began accepting bids to operate Manila&#x27;s electric company, and by extension, providing public lighting to the city and its suburbs. Detroit entrepreneur Charles M. Swift was the sole bidder and on March 24, 1903, was granted the original basic franchise of the Manila Electric Company. March 24 thus is marked annually as the company&#x27;s anniversary.

The Manila Electric Company acquired both La Electricista and the Compañía de los Tranvías de Filipinas, a firm that ran Manila&#x27;s horse-drawn tramways which was founded in 1882. Construction on the railed tramway began that same year. In addition to acquiring La Electricista&#x27;s Calle San Sebastian power plant, the company built its own turbine rotated by water steam generating electricity plant on Isla Provisora (later becoming the Manila Thermal Power Plant), which lighted the railed tram system and eventually also provided the electric service. By 1906, the Manila Suburb Railway were founded and later merged with the Manila Electric Company. Forming the Manila Electric, Railway and Lighting Company. The name Manila Electricity, Lighting and Railroad Company (MELARCo) was also considered.

===Manila Suburban Railways Company===
Swift was awarded another franchise in 1906 to operate a extension line from Paco to Fort McKinley and Pasig and founded the Manila Suburban Railway to operate this franchise. In 1919 this company merged with the Manila Electric Company. This extension was one of the most profitable of MERALCO&#x27;s lines.

By the 1920, MERALCO invested on transportation and owned a 170-strong fleet of streetcars, before switching over to buses later in that decade.

The company operated 52-miles of trams until World War II. The equipment and tracks of the system was severely damaged during the war and had to be removed.

===Power generation and distribution===
By 1915, electricity generation and distribution became the main MERALCO&#x27;s main income generator, overtaking its public transportation operations in terms of revenue. In 1919, it changed its official name to Manila Electric Company. By 1920, the company&#x27;s power capacity had grown to 45 million kWh.

In 1925, MERALCO was acquired by the utility holding company Associated Gas and Electric, which had begun a massive expansion throughout the United States and Canada. With AGECO&#x27;s financial backing, MERALCO began acquiring a number of existing utility companies in the Philippines, enabling the company to expand beyond Manila.

By 1930, MERALCO had completed construction of the Philippine&#x27;s first hydroelectric power plant, the 23MW Botocan Hydro Station. At the time, this plant was one of the largest engineering projects in Asia and constituted the largest single private capital investment in the Philippines. The additional capacity allowed the company to begin hooking up customers throughout the metropolitan area.
To drive demand for more power, MERALCO also opened a retail store in order to sell electric home appliances.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, the Japanese occupying forces forcibly transferred all of MERALCO&#x27;s assets and holdings to the Japanese-controlled Taiwan Power Company. 

===Postwar===

By war&#x27;s end, most of the former Meralco facilities had been destroyed. AGECO was reorganized as General Public Utilities Corporation or GPU in 1946. MERALCO&#x27;s autobus franchise was sold to Halili Transport.

===Acquisition by the López group===

In 1962, Eugenio López, Sr. of the influential López family of Iloilo put together Meralco Securities Corporation (MSC), which acquired MERALCO, making it wholly Filipino-owned. During 1962-72, he increased MERALCO&#x27;s power generating capacity by five times with the building of additional power stations in the Manila area with two more planned in Rizal Province.

The Meralco Building, designed by National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture José María Zaragoza, was built during this period. The Meralco Theater within it was inaugurated shortly thereafter, in March 1969.

===Martial law and Romualdez takeover===
In September 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos, who had begun feuding with the Lopezes, declared Martial Law, acquiring and consolidating power and effectively extending his beyond the constitutional term limit which would have forced him to step down in 1973. A few weeks later in November 1972, he issued Presidential Decree № 40, which nationalized the country&#x27;s electric generation and transmission. A few more weeks after that, Marcos had Lopez&#x27; son and namesake, Eugenio &quot;Geny&quot; Lopez, Jr. arrested without formal charges, claiming that the younger Lopez had been involved in an alleged assassination attempt against him. 

Geny&#x27;s arrest became a bargaining chip which eventually compelled the Lopezes to sell their controlling share of Meralco Securities Corporation to Marcos&#x27; associates late in 1973. Ownership of Meralco Securities Corporation was placed under a newly created shell company called the Meralco Foundation, Inc., controlled by Marcos&#x27; brother-in-law Benjamin Romualdez, which made a downpayment of about $1,500 for a &quot;very minimal&quot; total sale price of about $28 million (200 million pesos at the prevailing rate). Installment payments were supposed to be due starting two years later.

The Meralco Foundation takeover was immediately followed by a 100% increase in electric rates, with continuous increases throughout Romualdez&#x27; management. A rate adjustment clause, which allowed MERALCO to adjust its rates depending on crude oil increase or higher dollar exchange rates, was also introduced.

In 1977, MSC was renamed First Philippine Holdings Corporation. 

By 1978, all of the Philippines&#x27; major power plants were owned and operated by Napocor, including the Metro Manila plants that MERALCO had built beforehand in the 1960s. By the end of the Martial Law period in 1981, MERALCO expanded even further into Cavite and western parts of Laguna, Rizal and Quezon provinces, as well as parts of southern Bulacan.

Meralco Foundation&#x27;s control of MERALCO lasted until the People Power Revolution in 1986 when it defaulted on its payments under the terms of the original turnover of shares in 1973, although it took a five year period before the shares were eventually reverted to the Lopezes in 1991.

===After martial law===

President Corazon Aquino reverted company ownership to the López Group. She also enacted an executive order that allowed the company to directly compete with Napocor. 

On March 18, 1989, MERALCO unveiled its new and current corporate logo.

In 1990, MERALCO acquired the electric facilities and other assets of the Communications and Electric Development Authority, one of two companies that distributed power in Cavite Province for much of the 1970s and 80s.

===Entry of First Pacific and JG Summit groups===
Between 2009 and 2012, the López Group would reduce its 33.4% holdings in MERALCO by selling most of its shares to the First Pacific Group. By 2012, the López Group&#x27;s holdings in MERALCO would be reduced to 3.95%.

The First Pacific Group, through Beacon Electric Asset Holdings Inc. and Metro Pacific Investment Corporation, currently holds 45.46% share in MERALCO, followed by the JG Summit Group with 29.56%, for a combined 75.02% control of MERALCO.

===Early renewal initiatives during the 16th Congress===

In 2014 and 2015, MERALCO requested the 16th Congress to tackle the extension of its franchise early, although its renewal was not due until six years later, in 2020.

==Controversies==
===2008 legislative investigation on high power rates===
Meralco is facing a Philippine legislative inquiry/investigation for alleged excessive pricing. The government has considered a plan to take over Meralco, to reduce electricity bills. Meralco and National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) blamed each other for the high power rates. Meralco also blames high power generation costs, high transmission costs and government taxes imposed on the electricity sector from power generation to distribution. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) President Winston García, however, blamed Meralco&#x27;s inefficiency, its &quot;bloated bureaucracy&quot; and its sourcing of power from independent power producers (IPPs) also owned by the López Family, and the need to amend the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001. Oscar López said that if the GSIS would buy the Meralco shares, they must buy in whole cash, while many businessmen also said that taking over Meralco is not the way to reduce electrical price, which depends on the national government and the President. The issue was also seen as a purposeful diversion from the then-ongoing ZTE NBN scandal and other government issues. A perceived lack of general understanding regarding the issue of system loss, inherent in the business of utilities prompted Meralco&#x27;s former holding company, First Philippine Holdings, to issue advertisements explaining systems loss.

===Syndicated &quot;estafa&quot; and bribery case===
The Department of Justice (Philippines) filed syndicated (fraud) charges against Meralco in its August 22, 2008 31-page resolution, filed with the Pasig Regional Trial Court. The May 29 National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reform (Nasecore) complaint accused Meralco of &quot;illegally declaring as income ₱889 million in consumers&#x27; money, which represents interest from meter and bill deposits consumers had been paying since 1995.&quot; No bail was recommended for all the accused, 2006 officers of Meralco, to wit: Meralco chairman and CEO Manuel Lopez, executive vice president and chief financial officer Daniel Tagaza, first Vice-resident and treasurer Rafael Andrada, vice president and corporate auditor and compliance officer Helen De Guzman, vice president and assistant comptroller Antonio Valera, and senior assistant vice president and assistant treasurer Manolo Fernando; 2006 Meralco directors Arthur Defensor Jr., Gregory Domingo, Octavio Victor Espiritu, Christian Monsod, Federico Puno, Washington Sycip, Emilio Vicens, Francisco Viray and former Prime Minister Cesar Virata.

Nasecore&#x27;s complaint accusing Meralco of &quot;illegally declaring as income 889 million pesos in consumers&#x27; money, which represents interest from meter and bill deposits consumers had been paying since 1995,&quot; was immediately refuted by the accused company as the alleged ₱889 million only stemmed from a generally accepted accounting principle of reversing Meralco&#x27;s earlier provision for meter deposit interests which, earlier set at 10% per annum was deemed too high and was set to the recommended 6%. Meralco also questioned how a syndicated estafa case can arise when it has already announced and committed that it will be refunding to customers who paid meter deposit principals plus interest months ahead of the ERC prescribed schedule and has allocated enough funds for the said refund.

Meralco is also involved in the GSIS-Meralco bribery case.

===Dismissal of syndicated &quot;estafa&quot; case===
On October 6, 2008, the Pasig Regional Trial Court Branch 71 dismissed the syndicated &quot;estafa&quot; case filed against the Meralco board of directors, for the prosecution failed to establish all the elements of syndicated &quot;estafa&quot;.

Presiding Judge Franco Falcon, pointed out in the ruling that the board is not the kind described by the law as being formed to perpetrate an illegal act for the board of directors were elected by stockholders. The court explained, &quot;Therefore, the accused can never be charged of taking part in the commission of syndicated &quot;estafa&quot; not only because they are not part of a syndicate as contemplated by law in PD 1689, but more so, because there was absolutely no &quot;estafa&quot; committed.&quot;

According to Philippine law, to constitute syndicated &quot;estafa&quot;, the subject money or property must be received by the offenders. The money represents the accrued interests on the bill and meter deposits, which were paid by Meralco customers, not directly to the board, but to the various Meralco business centers where the customers transacted. Meralco expressed elation over the dismissal.

===Judiciary&#x27;s decision on 1999 disconnection incident===
A complaint was filed by Lucy Yu against Meralco which, on December 9, 1999, its representatives, forcibly entering her office at the New Supersonic Industrial Corp. in Valenzuela, shut off the electricity in the factory and Yu&#x27;s residence.

The Court of Appeals later ruled that Meralco violated the law when it cut off the electric supply of a consumer without notice; the decision later upheld by the Supreme Court in late June 2023, with Yu being entitled to ₱150,000 in damages. The court said that a written notice must be given to the consumer at least 48 hours prior to Meralco&#x27;s disconnection of its electric service on grounds cited under Section 4(a) of &quot;Republic Act No. 7832&quot;; in that case, a consumer&#x27;s right to due process was violated.

Spokesperson Joe Zaldarriaga, in a statement, said that Meralco will respect and abide by the said decision; however, he said that the incident occurred when Meralco was already implementing a policy of serving prior disconnection notice.

=== Allocation of the 2.4 GHz ISM band ===
The 2.4 GHz band is mostly used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. In 1993, the National Telecommunications Commission allocated the 2.4 GHz band for the exclusive use by Meralco in Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon for the operation of their Supervisory Control and Data Access (SCADA) system which controls and monitors Meralco’s substations. This has made the use of the 2.4 GHz band in the Philippines illegal, in spite of the International Telecommunication Union declaring the 2.4 GHz band as an ISM unlicensed band.

On September 12, 2003, the NTC issued Memorandum Circular No. 09-09-2003, which lifted the ban on the 2.4 GHz band.

== Service area ==

Meralco serves Metro Manila, where it is the sole electricity distributor, as well as some nearby provinces, like Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon. Bulacan, Cavite, and Rizal are solely served by Meralco, but on some provinces, it only serves some parts, like in Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon, where most or some areas are served by electric cooperatives. In Laguna and Quezon, most part of those provinces are served by the company, but other areas, mostly rural municipalities, are served by electric cooperatives. In Batangas, only Santo Tomas, the First Philippine Industrial Park and First Industrial Township SEZ both in Tanauan, Batangas City, San Pascual and parts of Laurel (Barangays of Niyugan and Dayap Itaas) and Calaca (parts of Barangay Cahil) which facing Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway are served by Meralco, and the rest of the province are franchise areas of electric cooperatives. In Pampanga, some barangays in Candaba are served by the company.

<text>Repton is a video game originally developed by 16-year-old Briton Tim Tyler for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron and released by Superior Software in 1985. The game spawned a series of follow up games which were released throughout the 1980s. The series sold around 125,000 copies between 1985 and 1990 with &quot;Repton 2&quot; selling 35,000 itself. The games have since been remade for several modern systems, including &quot;iRepton&quot; for the iPhone / iPod Touch in 2010, and &quot;Android Repton 1&quot;, &quot;Android Repton 2&quot; and &quot;Android Repton 3&quot; from 2016 to 2018.

The author was inspired by a review of the recently released &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, but had never played the game. Compared with &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, &quot;Repton&quot; is a much more calm and organized playing experience with the emphasis on puzzle-solving as opposed to arcade-style improvisation. This remained true as more types of object were added in the sequels.

==Series overview==
===&quot;Repton&quot;===

Repton, the titular protagonist, is moved around an underground maze in a quest to find all the diamonds (some are held in safes, their release being triggered by finding and collecting a key) within a time limit for each of several levels, while avoiding being trapped or killed by falling rocks and monsters hatched from eggs. The original &quot;Repton&quot; game was released in the summer of 1985 and has 12 levels, with passwords making it possible to jump directly to later levels. If passwords are employed, on completion of the final level the displayed message challenges the player to complete the game without using them. The new versions of &quot;Repton&quot; for the PC, iOS and Android introduce additional levels; new &quot;Repton&quot; levels are also featured in &quot;Repton Spectacular&quot;, &quot;Repton&#x27;s Mystic Challenge (for Repton 1)&quot; and &quot;Repton&#x27;s Journeys (for Repton 2)&quot;.

===&quot;Repton 2&quot;===
The sequel to the game, &quot;Repton 2&quot;, released for Christmas 1985 (release date 14 November 1985 ) is much bigger. It introduces several new features: spirits (that follow walls and objects to their left and must be guided into cages, turning them into diamonds) and skulls, both of which are fatal to Repton on collision. There are also jigsaw puzzle pieces to collect, which eventually spell out the message &quot;Repton 2 is ended&quot;. There are no levels as such in &quot;Repton 2&quot;: instead transporters move Repton between different screens which, subject to some restrictions, can be completed in any order desired. The entire game is in effect one very large level without passwords, meaning that it must be completed in one attempt. Finally, some screens also contain an exposed &#x27;roof&#x27;, where meteors (predictably fatal to Repton) fall from the sky.

Repton&#x27;s requirements in &quot;Repton 2&quot; are challenging: Repton must not only collect all diamonds (including those held in safes and behind cages), but also collect all earth, kill all the monsters, collect all puzzle pieces and use all transporters. Once these substantial tasks have been accomplished, Repton must then negotiate the &#x27;roof&#x27; of the entire width of the final screen, avoiding meteors falling from the sky in order to reach the starport and thus complete the game. This part is particularly tricky, since the meteors fall in a random fashion, making it difficult for the gamer to guide Repton to safety. This long list of requirements, coupled with the fact that the game must be completed in one attempt, marks &quot;Repton 2&quot; as the hardest &quot;Repton&quot; game to successfully complete. The initial version of &quot;Repton 2&quot; contained one diamond fewer than the stipulated number needed to finish the game, so completion of this first version is impossible. When &quot;Repton 2&quot; was re-written for the PC, it introduced a &#x27;save game&#x27; feature making it considerably easier to complete. In addition, brand new scenarios were included, effectively new games.

===&quot;Repton 3&quot;===
&quot;Repton 3&quot;, released on 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior&#x27;s invitation since Tim Tyler was not interested in programming it, although he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, &quot;Repton 3&quot; took eight months. It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level&#x27;s time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the players have to plan their routes so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level.

&quot;Repton 3&quot; includes a map editor along with the game, so that data files can be created with new maps and graphics for the levels. Three themed sets of such files were released as continuations of &quot;Repton 3&quot;, with the titles &quot;Around the World in 40 Screens&quot; (1987), &quot;The Life of Repton&quot; (1987) and &quot;Repton Thru Time&quot; (1988). These three titles use a slightly modified game engine, in which the algorithm for deciding on the direction spirits first move at the start of a level is improved. They all come with the same game editor as &quot;Repton 3&quot;.

===&quot;Repton Infinity&quot;===
&quot;Repton Infinity&quot; was released in 1988, by which time the BBC Micro&#x27;s popularity as a games platform was beginning to wane. It was developed by Dave Acton and Dave Lawrence (who wrote the user-submitted program section *INFO in &quot;Acorn User&quot; magazine). It supplements the map editor and graphics editor with a powerful game logic editor which made it possible to alter the way all game objects behaved using a purpose-designed language called &quot;Reptol&quot;. Four different example games are included to demonstrate its flexibility:
* &quot;Repton 3 - Take 2&quot;, with a couple of small technical differences in gameplay from &quot;Repton 3&quot;.
* &quot;Repton 4&quot;, with imaginative new objects including photocopiers and moving jewels.
* &quot;Robbo&quot;, &quot;a crazy robot in a strange topsy-turvy world&quot;, according to the game inlay.
* &quot;Trakker&quot;, a chaotic game in which a bulldozer-driving protagonist must destroy various monsters by pushing fruit at them, and all scores are multiples of 17.

There was a long-running problem, infamous amongst owners of the B+, the updated BBC B with 64k, when the newly released &quot;Repton Infinity&quot; ran on the original BBC B but refused to load on the updated B+. A string of unsuccessful replacements were issued before one that was compatible with both was eventually released.

===&quot;EGO: Repton 4&quot;===
A game marketed as &quot;EGO: Repton 4&quot; was released for the Acorn Archimedes in 1992. It was designed by Richard Hanson and programmed by Gary Partis. This was actually an Archimedes conversion of an earlier Amiga/Atari ST game called &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; with the character of Repton added in. The game bears little relation to the rest of the Repton series, particularly in that contrary to the spirit of the original it relies on &quot;secret&quot; traps and passages which can only be discovered by walking onto them. The objects and objectives in all the previous &quot;Repton&quot; games are visible and there are no hidden secrets to be discovered, although in some advanced episodes - notably &quot;OAP&quot; in &quot;Life of Repton&quot;, &quot;Oceans&quot; in &quot;Around the World&quot; and &quot;Future&quot; in &quot;Repton Thru Time&quot; - some objects and enemies are invisible or appear very similar to desirable or innocuous objects.

===&quot;Repton: The Lost Realms&quot;===
In 1988, teenage programmer Paras Sidapara submitted a game he called &quot;Repton 4&quot; to Superior Software. As Superior were already working on &quot;Repton Infinity&quot;, it was not published, and was forgotten until 2008, when a copy was rediscovered. The game was re-programmed by Sarah Walker and rechristened &quot;The Lost Realms&quot;, to avoid confusion with the &quot;Repton 4&quot; game included in &quot;Repton Infinity&quot;. It was launched in November 2010 by Retro Software, with Superior&#x27;s permission. The game is similar in style to &quot;Repton 3&quot;, retaining the structure of separate, password-protected levels and the map and graphics editors. New features include balloons, &quot;absorbency&quot; doors (which can be opened when an &quot;absorbalene&quot; pill is collected, but each pill only allows a certain number of doors to be opened) and ice crystals (which, when collected, freeze any monsters on the level).

==Music==
The music for &quot;Repton&quot; is &quot;Black and White Rag&quot;, by George Botsford, which has been well-known in the UK since at least its 1969 popularisation as the theme tune to the long-running television snooker programme &quot;Pot Black&quot;. The Scott Joplin intermezzo &quot;The Chrysanthemum&quot; is the music for &quot;Repton 2&quot;, and the music for &quot;Repton 3&quot; was composed specifically for the game by Paul Hughes and Peter Clarke. &quot;Repton Infinity&quot; features in-game music, on pressing the &#x27;T&#x27; key, although it does not play at the same time as the sound effects during the game, and is turned off by default; it was composed especially for the game by David Acton.

==&quot;Repton&quot; ports, clones and derivatives==
===Ports===
The &quot;Repton&quot; games were closely associated with the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron but versions were released for other 8-bit computers. Superior Software had planned to launch &quot;Repton 3&quot; with ports for the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC (as shown in pre-release press advertisements). The Amstrad version was never released but the C64 port did arrive in 1987. Ports of the first 3 &quot;Repton&quot; games were later developed for the ZX Spectrum and &quot;Repton&quot; and &quot;Repton 2&quot; were released together as &quot;Repton Mania&quot; in 1989 (published using the joint Superior/Alligata name). This was not a success and the Spectrum &quot;Repton 3&quot; was not released. In 1989 a version of &quot;Repton 3&quot; featuring all expansion packs was also released for the BBC Micro&#x27;s replacement, the 32-bit Acorn Archimedes. Its programmer, John Wallace, also produced a slightly expanded version of &quot;Repton 2&quot; for the Acorn Archimedes which was released on the 1993 &quot;Play It Again Sam 2&quot; compilation (which also included &quot;Zarch&quot;, &quot;Master Break&quot; and &quot;Arcpinball&quot;). None of these ports achieved the sales of the BBC originals.

In the late 1990s, Superior sub-licensed the games to ProAction who released a number of RISC OS ports for the Acorn Archimedes and RiscPC. John Wallace created new ports of &quot;Repton&quot;, &quot;Repton 2&quot; and &quot;Repton 3&quot;. ProAction also released &quot;Desktop Repton&quot; which includes the 3 games (including the expansion games for &quot;Repton 3&quot;). These games were built from scratch by Darren Salt, and developed to run in a multi tasking window on the desktop.

There have been numerous ports of &quot;Repton 3&quot;, including a free version for Linux.

Under the name Superior Interactive, the original publishers re-released versions of &quot;Repton 1&quot; (2003), &quot;Repton 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Repton 3&quot;, including all of the expansion games (2005), for Microsoft Windows. They also released a large pack of new levels for all three modern Repton ports named &quot;Repton Spectacular&quot; in 2010. Also in 2010, &quot;iRepton&quot; was released for the Apple iPhone / iPod Touch (ESZ Consulting / Superior Interactive). This has retro and enhanced graphics and sounds and new screens. In 2014 &quot;iRepton 3&quot; was released for the iPad and iPhone, featuring the same level of graphic enhancements as &quot;iRepton 1&quot;, which also had an overhaul at the same time.

===Clones===
A deliberate clone called &quot;Ripton&quot;, extremely faithful apart from different level design and several humorous digs at the original game, was written by Kenton Price and submitted to &quot;A&amp;B Computing&quot; but the magazine never dared to publish it. It is, however, now available at BBC software Internet sites.

There was also a PD clone for the ZX Spectrum called &quot;Riptoff&quot;, which included a level editor. It was developed by Rick O&#x27;Neill and Craig Hunter, and was released exclusively on a 1991 Your Sinclair covertape.

===Derivatives===
Due to &quot;Repton&quot;&#x27;s ubiquity on the platform, it is sometimes compared to other scrolling-map games for the BBC/Electron. Later puzzle-based games such as &quot;Bonecruncher&quot; and &quot;Clogger&quot; might be said to be derivatives of &quot;Repton&quot;, and this perception is also encompassed by arcade adventure/role-playing games presented in four-way-scrolling format – the notable ones being &quot;Ravenskull&quot; and &quot;Pipeline&quot; – despite their different styles involving unique objects, encounters and unexpected traps.

A non-scrolling 5-level type-in called &quot;Pitfall Pete&quot; written by Jonathan Temple was also described as &quot;&#x27;Repton&#x27; style&quot; when it was published by BEEBUG in 1986 and expanded to 15 levels in 1991.

&quot;Repton&quot;&#x27;s original author has written a public domain Java rocks-and-diamonds game, Rockz, which features elements in the vein of both &quot;Repton 2&quot; and &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;.

A game called &quot;Mole Miner&quot; was released for Android devices in 2009 by Little Fluffy Toys Ltd. The game was designed by Kenton Price, who also wrote &quot;Ripton&quot;. It builds on the rocks-and-diamonds genre typified by &quot;Repton&quot;, extending it with features such as explosives, sliding ice and wraparound, and includes a community level designer. &quot;Mole Miner&quot; contains 60 levels created by Michael S. Repton, the author of many levels in later &quot;Repton&quot; series games.

<text>Kontush sash (&quot;kontusz belt&quot;; , ) was a cloth sash used for girding a kontusz (a robe-like garment). It was one of the most distinctive items of male dress of Polish and Lithuanian nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) and is a key component of the . In an earlier period, sometimes narrower sashes of fine cloth or silk net were worn, but the wide kontusz sash is specific to the later period. A variant known in Belarus lands is .

==Origins==
Like the rest of the Polish national dress, the kontusz sash was of eastern origin. It comprised a 3- to 4.5-meter-long strip of fabric covered with varied designs, around 40 cm wide. Luxurious sashes were made with silk and gold. Depending on the sash&#x27;s width, it might be folded a number of ways so as to reveal various designs on various occasions; the most ornate sashes were considered to have four sides.

Initially such sashes were imported from Persia and Turkey. In the 17th century several sash manufactories were founded at places all over &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;, such as Kobyłka, Lipków, Hrodna, Kraków and Gdańsk. The largest and most notable manufacturies, however, were at Slutsk. Sashes produced there were considered the most desirable and were also the most expensive. Because of the popularity of the &quot;pas kontuszowy&quot; produced there, it was sometimes called &quot;pas słucki&quot; (Slutsk sash), regardless of the actual place of origin. Slutsk sashes had two different color patterns on each side.

==Kontush Sash an attribute of a nobleman==

The Kontush Sash (belt) has an oriental provenance rooted in Persian and Turkish tradition. Continual contact between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Persia and even more with Turkey developed vast trade roots and raised popular interest in oriental art and decoration all over Eastern Europe. The Ideology of Sarmatism created in the XVIc a embracing many the nations of the Commonwealth. The Kontush Belt was a visual manifestation of Sarmatian identity and was widely popular in Lithuania and Belarus, in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Saxony, Moldavia, Besarabia and some parts of Russia. Kontush belts were worn by the Nobility, Cossack elders and high municipal officials. 

The time of prosperity during the period of XVI – XVIIIc created surplus financial resources often channeled into culture, art and decoration. Polish Armenian merchants imported objects of luxury: oriental carpets, weapons decorated with gold and stones, expensive fabrics. Kontush belts especially emphasized the status of the bearer and were unusually expensive. At a certain moment the demand for Kontush belts became so large that it was necessary to open local manufacturing on the territory of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The workshops producing Kontush Belts in Slutsk, Grodno, Lvov, Vilnius, Buchach, Kobylki, Kraków, Gdansk, Lipkow were opened mostly by Polish–Lithuanian Armenians. The belts that were made there still had a lot of oriental ornamentation, but had their own distinct character – different from the belts formerly imported from Persia and Turkey. 

There was a practical aspect to the belt as well. Folded in half and wrapped around the body, it served as a pocket for money and documents. 
Most belts are about 30 cm wide and around 3,5m long. 

As a result of the weaving technique – one side of the belt was a negative of the other. This way it was possible for the belt to have two different color schemes (so called two-sided belt). Further division of the belt allowed for four color compositions (four-sided belt). The price of the belt depended on the materials used (sometimes they added silver and gold thread). The complexity of the design raised the price even more since it required more complicated manufacturing machinery, higher qualifications of the craftsmen and a longer production cycle. The four-sided belts were the most expensive. They were meant to be worn on different occasions: bright side – for weddings, dark side for funerals, green side for the green kontush etc. Very often the belt served as a table decoration – it was placed on the center atop the table cloth.
==In popular culture==
A modern Polish poet and a singer, Jacek Kaczmarski, has sung about those sashes in one of his ballads, &quot;Z pasa słuckiego pożytek&quot; (&quot;The Use of a Slutsk Sash&quot;).

<text>The delia () is a garment worn by male &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The delia is similar to a coat or cloak, and was worn over the &quot;żupan&quot; from the 16th until the early 18th century.

The delia was usually fashioned from wool, cotton, or velvet, and finished with fur. The typical delia had short, loose, unsewn sleeves, and was fastened with metal buttons over the breast. The delia was of Oriental origin and the word itself came to Poland in the mid-16th century from Turkey.

<doc id="1270961" wikidata="Q5194403" url="?curid=1270961" title="Cup-tied">
<text>In association football, a player who has appeared for a football club during a knockout cup but subsequently transfers to another club is ineligible to play for the new club in the remainder of that season&#x27;s cup competition. Such a player is said to be cup-tied, i.e. tied to their original club for the duration of the cup tournament. They become eligible for their new club in the following season.

The rule is intended to prevent teams which progress in the competition buying talented players from teams which have already been eliminated, in an attempt to increase their chances of winning. It also discourages players whose chief priority is winning a trophy from requesting a transfer once their team has been eliminated from the competition. Since the introduction of transfer windows, which the cup-tied rule pre-dates, some have criticised the rule as outdated. Nevertheless, it remains widely applied.

Almost all cup competitions worldwide operate a cup-tied rule, but leagues do not (as leagues do not eliminate teams during the season). Cup-tied players are only prevented from playing in that specific competition, so for example a player who is cup-tied in the FA Cup may still be eligible to play in the League Cup (or vice versa). UEFA competitions are an exception: because teams can switch between the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League during the season, UEFA has a more complex system for determining whether a player is cup-tied in one or both of those competitions.

==The cup-tied rule==
In almost all domestic and international club cup competitions, any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is &quot;tied&quot; to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition. This prevents a wealthy team still in the competition from gaining an unfair advantage by signing talented players from clubs that may have lost out in earlier rounds, in an attempt to increase their cup chances.

The rule applies to individual cup competitions, such that a player who plays in the English FA Cup, but not the EFL Cup, for example, is cup-tied only in the former competition. If the player signs for a new club in the same season, they are thus eligible for the EFL Cup but not the FA Cup.

Breaching the cup-tied rule can result in a result being declared invalid, with serious consequences for the offending club. Governing bodies usually reserve the right to waive the rule but do so only in exceptional circumstances.

===UEFA competitions===
UEFA operates European club football competitions, primarily the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. UEFA&#x27;s regulations state that, with a few exceptions, players who play in any European club competition are subsequently cup-tied with respect to all European football for the remainder of the season. On 27 March 2018, UEFA announced that it would phase out the cup-tied rule for the Champions League and Europa League, starting in the 2018–2019 season.

The main current exception is the UEFA Super Cup, contested by the winners of the previous seasons&#x27; Champions League and Europa League. As this is effectively a prestige friendly with only one round, the cup-tied rule is seen as unnecessary. Representing a club in this fixture does not affect a player&#x27;s eligibility in other UEFA competitions. Similarly, cup-tying did not apply to matches in the now-defunct pre-season UEFA Intertoto Cup, up to the semi-final round.

A further exemption applies: one player per club who would normally be cup-tied can be registered and eligible to play, so long as their previous club did not field that player in the same competition. This means that players can represent two clubs in the Europa League and Champions League, but only a maximum of one player per club. However, if the first club switches into the same competition (e.g. transfers from the Champions League to the Europa League through finishing third in the group stage), the transferred player becomes ineligible. This can lead to some complex situations.

===Criticism===
The cup-tied rule comes in for criticism from various fans and media pundits, particularly when a high-profile player is ineligible for significant matches. Some argue that the rule is antiquated and that since the introduction of transfer windows, clubs cannot buy players solely for cup matches, but will only do so for the league, where there is no cup-tied rule.

==Examples==

In the 2008 FA Cup Final against Cardiff City, and in previous rounds, former Portsmouth player Jermain Defoe was cup-tied and was unable to play. Portsmouth won the cup final . There were similar cases with Earl Barrett&#x27;s transfer to 1995 FA Cup winners Everton from Aston Villa, while beaten finalists Manchester United were unable to select Andy Cole, as he had played for Newcastle United in the third round a few days before his transfer.

In 2006, Robbie Fowler was cup-tied for the victorious Liverpool team after his mid-season return to Anfield from Manchester City.

In February 1993, Arsenal re-signed defender Martin Keown from Everton, nearly seven years after he had left the club. They went on to win the League Cup and FA Cup that season, but Keown was unable to play in either of the finals, having already played in both competitions for Everton.

In January 1991, defender Viv Anderson was sold to Sheffield Wednesday by Manchester United, and three months later the two teams met in the League Cup final. Sheffield Wednesday won the game, but Anderson had been unable to play, for he had appeared - and scored - in a second-round tie for Manchester United six months earlier.

In another instance, Ronaldo bought out his contract with Real Madrid to move to Milan; he was cup-tied to Madrid in the Champions League. Milan went on to win the tournament, but Ronaldo was not allowed to play in any of their games. Andrei Arshavin was cup-tied in the Champions League after moving to Arsenal during the January 2009 transfer window, having earlier represented Zenit St. Petersburg in the group stage of that competition. In another example concerning Liverpool, this time in the UEFA Champions League, Fernando Morientes was cup-tied for their games leading up to and including the final of the competition in 2005, which Liverpool won. This was due to Morientes playing in the group stage of the competition with Real Madrid.

===Enforcement===
In the 1999–2000 Football League Cup, West Ham United were ordered to replay a match they had won against Aston Villa, after bringing on as a substitute Emmanuel Omoyinmi, who had appeared for Gillingham in an earlier round. West Ham lost the replay.

A notable example of non-enforcement was in the 1957–58 FA Cup. Stan Crowther and Ernie Taylor would normally have been cup-tied and thus ineligible to play for Manchester United. However, they were granted an exemption and allowed to play because the club had suffered the Munich air disaster earlier that season. In that air crash, eight United players died and two others were so seriously injured that they never played again, while five others had still not fully recovered from their injuries when the following match was played. The Football Association therefore waived the cup-tied rule.

===UEFA===
UEFA&#x27;s rules regarding their linked competitions and potential exceptions can lead to some complex situations. This was the case with Alan Hutton, who could not play in Europe for Tottenham Hotspur following his former club Rangers&#x27; coming third in their Champions League group, which meant they switched to the Europa League for the remainder of the competition. Had Rangers come first, second, or fourth in their group, Hutton would have been able to play for Tottenham.

Another case came in 2009, when Real Madrid purchased Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Lassana Diarra – both of whom had already played European football during the season for Ajax and Portsmouth, respectively – during the winter transfer window. Because of UEFA rules, Real Madrid could only pick one of these players, and ended up selecting Diarra for their European roster. Despite the rule, Real Madrid attempted to circumvent the restriction, to no avail.

==Manipulation==

Football managers can sometimes decide whether to field a player in order to deliberately cup-tie (or avoid cup-tying) the player. This can be used to manipulate their value on the transfer market for the remainder of the season, because it affects whether any potential new club can field them in the cup. There are two major motivations for deciding to cup-tie a player or not:

===To increase a player&#x27;s value===
A team that wishes to transfer a player may deliberately choose not to field them in cup competitions to ensure they are not cup-tied, increasing the player&#x27;s usefulness to a club that is still involved in the same competition.

Two examples of this were in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons, both of which involved English Premier League club Liverpool. In 2004–05, Liverpool&#x27;s Michael Owen sat out of his club&#x27;s Champions League games so that other top European teams would be able to sign him; he subsequently transferred to Real Madrid. 

The following season, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez again decided to keep one of his players, Milan Baroš, out of Liverpool&#x27;s squad for their 2005–06 UEFA Champions League ties in order to retain his value to clubs interested in purchasing the Czech striker&#x27;s services. This time the manipulation was less successful: Baroš eventually moved to Aston Villa, a club who were not involved in the Champions League and therefore gained no benefit from Baroš not being cup-tied.

===To discourage transfer interest===
Similarly, although less often, a team may deliberately cup-tie a player to discourage attempts (by the player or interested clubs) to transfer them during that season. This only applies if the player would not otherwise make it onto the team – it can be achieved by bringing them on as a substitute towards the end of a game. However, this is of limited use for international transfers, where cup-tying only applies if both teams involved in the transfer are competing in the same continental competition (such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League).

A variation of this involves national team coaches starting players in order to bind them to the country and prevent call-ups from other National Teams.

<doc id="1270962" wikidata="Q330482" url="?curid=1270962" title="Michael Sprott">
<text>Michael Sprott (born 16 January 1975) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2018. At regional level, he held multiple heavyweight championships, including the British and Commonwealth titles in 2004; and challenged three times for the European title in 2005, 2010 and 2011; and won the Prizefighter series in 2010 and 2013.

==Career==
After a quiet amateur career, Sprott turned pro in November 1996 under the old Frank Bruno trainer, Terry Lawless. He won 11 fights, including a points win over veteran Michael Murray before taking on Harry Senior in September 1998 for the Southern Area Heavyweight title. Senior, a respected sparring partner, had recently dedicated himself to being a full-time professional, and took Sprott out in 6 rounds with body shots. Sprott came back with 3 wins before falling apart in 3 rounds versus British contender Wayne Llewelyn in October 2000.

Seemingly relegated to journeyman status, In February 2001 in London, Sprott scored an upset when he outpointed the once-beaten German Timo Hoffmann, who had lost only to Vitali Klitschko. He travelled to Germany for the rematch, controversially outpointed by Hoffmann in a result that was jeered loudly by the German crowd.

In November 2001, he travelled to South Africa to face hard hitting fringe contender Corrie Sanders. In a brief and entertaining fight, Sprott rocked the southpaw before being decked himself, and suffering a controversial stoppage by the referee, with even the South African commentators deploring the stoppage.

In February 2002, Keith Long pulled out from a British and Commonwealth title fight with Danny Williams, and Sprott flew in from a holiday in Jamaica on only a few days notice. After a few rounds he ran out of gas and was stopped in the seventh round, but showed he could compete at national level. It was around this time that Sprott brought in trainer John Bloomfield, who spent six years with Frank Bruno.

After this challenge, Sprott went on a successful run of form, winning 8 fights, including knockouts of Pele Reid (KO7), ex-British champ Michael Holden (KO4), Mark Potter (KO3), and Colin Kenna (KO1), setting up a rematch with Williams.

In September 2003, Sprott qualified for another shot at Williams and his titles, but after a far more competitive fight, Sprott was the victim of several low blows. When he complained to the referee he was controversially knocked out by a Williams left hook.

In January 2004, Sprott narrowly outpointed Williams in their third and final fight (115-114), lifting the British and Commonwealth titles. A few months later Williams would knockout Mike Tyson, however Sprott would lose his titles in his first defense, matched with fast undefeated Matt Skelton (12-0), Sprott was mauled and stopped in the 12th. His last fight of 2004 was a win against Czech heavyweight champ Robert Šulgan in Bethnal Green.

In 2005, Sprott would take the first of many trips abroad fighting top prospects, usually at short notice. In April he beat the German amateur star Cengiz Koc, but in October was beaten on points by Olympian Paolo Vidoz in a European title fight, both fights in Germany. In December he fought future European champ Vladimir Virchis in Austria, but was once-again the victim of a controversial decision loss.

In February 2006, he outboxed veteran Antoine Palatis in Scotland, but in a WBA Eliminator in July was hammered in 8 one-sided rounds by undefeated Ruslan Chagaev. Despite the loss he went back to Germany and beat a third German prospect when he upset undefeated southpaw Rene Dettweiller in November.

During his travels in Germany, Sprott had picked up the second-tier European Heavyweight title, the &quot;EU&quot; title, which he defended against 2000 Olympic Gold medallist Audley Harrison in London, February 2007. Harrison had demolished Danny Williams in his last fight and was on course to face Matt Skelton in a world title eliminator. A 9/2 underdog with most bookies, Sprott came off the floor in the 1st round to score a rare stoppage win by knocking Harrison clean out in the 3rd with a left hook; and seemingly ending his career.

On 14 July 2007, Sprott lost to Matt Skelton in a 12-round contest. The fight was of a very poor standard with Skelton winning on points.

On 31 May 2008, Sprott travelled to Germany to face hot prospect, and the WBA&#x27;s #4 ranked contender Taras Bidenko. Sprott was outpointed in a 10-round unanimous decision, with 2 judges scoring the bout 97–93, and the other seeing it 97–94.

On 14 March 2009, Sprott fought former WBO heavyweight champion Lamon Brewster and lost a unanimous decision.

He fought Alexander Ustinov on 20 June 2009, but lost by unanimous decision after ten rounds. However he beat German Werner Kreiskott by round 1 TKO in March 2010 and this earned him a shot at the vacant European Boxing Union title against old foe Audley Harrison at Alexandra Palace in April 2010. Sprott was leading the bout on all three scorecards before Harrison knocked out Sprott with seconds remaining of round 12.

On 9 October 2010, a 35-year-old Sprott competed in Sky&#x27;s &#x27;PrizeFighter&#x27; series (Heavyweights), reaching the final where he fought Matt Skelton. It was third time lucky for Sprott, who had lost his previous 2 contests with the 43-year-old Skelton, Winning on a split decision (29-28 Skelton 29-28 sprott 29-28 sprott) after the 3 round contest and winning £32,000 in &#x27;winner take all&#x27; prize money. In September 2011, he suffered a third defeat in a European heavyweight title bout when he lost a unanimous points decision to Ukrainian Alexander Dimitrenko in Hamburg.

==Outside the ring==
Michael Sprott has a son called Darnell born around 2001. Darnell&#x27;s name is stitched on the shorts Sprott wears for his professional contests. In recent contests Sprott&#x27;s shorts have also displayed the name of his late sister Ginette, who took her own life in September 2009 after a long battle with depression.

He lists his hobbies as weights, travelling and meeting new people. Outside boxing, Sprott enjoys rugby and the Wimbledon Championships. His favourite football teams are Reading FC and Arsenal F.C.

<text>Chauncey Jerome (1793–1868) was an American clockmaker in the early 19th century. He made a fortune selling his clocks, and his business grew quickly. However, his company failed in 1856, and he died in poverty.

==Early life==
He was born in Canaan in 1793; Chauncey Jerome was the son of Sarah Noble and Lyman Jerome, a blacksmith and nail-maker.

==Career==

Jerome began his career in Plymouth, making dials for long-case clocks. Jerome learned what he could about clocks, particularly clock cases, and then went to New Jersey to make seven-foot cases for clocks.

In 1816 he went to work for Eli Terry making &quot;Patent Shelf Clocks,&quot; learning how to make previously handmade cases using machinery. Deciding to go into business for himself, Jerome began to make cases, trading them to Terry for wooden movements.

In 1822 Jerome moved his business to Bristol, opening a small shop with his brother Noble, producing 30-hour and eight-day wooden clocks. The company installed the first circular saw ever seen in Bristol.

By 1837 Jerome&#x27;s company was selling more clocks than any of his competitors. A one-day wood-cased clock, which sold for six dollars, had helped put the company on the map. A year later his company was selling that same clock for four dollars.

By 1841 the company was showing an annual profit of a whopping $35,000, primarily from the sale of brass movements.

In 1842 Jerome moved his clock-case manufacturing operation to St. John Street in New Haven. Three years later, following a fire that destroyed the Bristol plant, Jerome relocated the entire operation to the Elm City. Enlarging the plant, the company soon became the largest industrial employer in the city, producing 150,000 clocks annually.

Because of his discovery of a method of stamping rather than using casting gears, Jerome was producing the lowest-priced clocks in the world at the time.

In 1850 Jerome formed the Jerome Manufacturing Co. as a joint-stock company with Benedict &amp; Burnham, brass manufacturers of Waterbury. In 1853 the company became known as the New Haven Clock Co., producing 444,000 clocks and timepieces annually.

Jerome&#x27;s future should have been secure but in 1855 he bought out a failed Bridgeport clock company controlled by P.T. Barnum, which wiped him out financially, leaving the Jerome Manufacturing Co. bankrupt. Jerome never recovered from the loss. By his own admission, he was a better inventor than businessman.

Traveling from town to town, Jerome took jobs where he could, often working for clock companies that had learned the business of clock making using Jerome&#x27;s inventions. Returning to New Haven near the end of his life, he died, penniless, in 1868 at age 74.

Nevertheless, Jerome had made a historic contribution to his industry when he substituted brass works for wooden works, said to be &quot;the greatest and most far-reaching contribution to the clock industry.&quot;

He made, and lost, a fortune selling his clocks and was perhaps the most influential and creative person associated with the American clock business during the mid-19th century. In addition he served as a legislator in 1834, a Presidential elector in 1852 and mayor of New Haven from 1854 to 1855.

Always humble, of his own life he wrote: &quot;The ticking of a clock is music to me, and although many of my experiences as a business man have been trying and bitter, I have satisfaction of knowing that I have lived the life of an honest man, and have been of some use to my fellow men.&quot;

==Early life==

Jerome was born in Canaan, Connecticut, and later moved to Plymouth, Connecticut, where his father started a blacksmith shop. Jerome was a young boy when his father died, on October 5, 1804, and was forced to work in apprenticeship with salesmen. In one event, when walking around Bethlehem, Connecticut, to get to Torrington with his master, he noted how close he was to his mother in Plymouth, that night he made a run for it, running about twenty miles through woods, properties, farms, and in one case chased by dogs for a few miles, finally met his mother the next morning in Plymouth, the moment he contacted her, he realized it was morning and had to leave. He was victim of war at New Haven Fort, and when finished, he moved back to Plymouth to start an apprenticeship with Eli Terry.

==Brave ideas, and the Journey to England==

Jerome started manufacturing in Bristol off of West Street. He took note of all of the men who laughed at &quot;Mr. Terry&quot; for Terry&#x27;s foolish ideas of selling a clock for a minor $14. Jerome came up with the idea of a rectangular shelf clock, brass in method, and sell-able for $1, the OG clock. Jerome sent his son, and a peddler who was a great friend of Jerome to England to sell his one dollar OG clocks.

Several months went by, as store owners in England refused to buy Jerome&#x27;s clocks. The shop owners understood that Eli Terry&#x27;s pillar and scroll clocks were &quot;garbage&quot; and never worked (because wooden gears warp overseas, causing poor time keepers). Finally Jerome&#x27;s son got a man to buy a clock for one dollar, and put it on a shelf - the next day, an English man walked in and saw it was still working, and proudly purchased the clock, this started a chain reaction, and the shop owner purchased 100 more clocks on the spot.

Jerome&#x27;s friend who supervised his son fell ill and died in England, followed by his son three months later.

<text>&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; is a song by the American musical duo the Weather Girls from their third studio album, &quot;Success&quot; (1983). It was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on September 10, 1982, through Columbia Records and CBS Records International. Paul Jabara wrote the song in collaboration with Paul Shaffer, and produced the song in collaboration with Bob Esty. &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; incorporates elements of R&amp;B, soul, and 1970s-style electronic dance music. Its lyrics describe an excitement and enjoyment of many different types of men.

&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was a number-one dance hit in the United States, and reached the top ten in various other countries worldwide. VH1 listed the song as one of the Greatest Songs of the 1980s as well as one of the Greatest Songs of the 2000s decade. At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards (1983), &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; received a nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

==Development and production==

Paul Jabara and Paul Shaffer wrote the song over the course of one afternoon in 1979, intending it for Donna Summer, who had scored a hit with &quot;Last Dance&quot; (1978). However, as Shaffer later recalled, Summer had recently become a born-again Christian and rejected the song as &quot;blasphemous&quot;. The song was then offered to Diana Ross, Cher, and Barbra Streisand, all of whom declined it.

In 1982, the song was offered to the Weather Girls (then known as the Two Tons and formerly known as Two Tons O&#x27; Fun). Martha Wash and Izora Armstead of the Two Tons also dismissed the song. Wash recounted &quot;We thought it was a crazy song — in fact, too crazy to record. I kept saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s raining men? Really? Are you kidding me?&#x27;... I just did not think people would buy it... That&#x27;s why I kept saying no.&quot; The duo eventually recorded the song in ninety minutes after Jabara persistently pleaded with them to record the song. The Waters Sisters (Julia Waters-Tillman and Maxine Waters-Willard), Stephanie Spruill, and Zenobia Conkerite performed background vocals on the chorus of the song.

==Music==

According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; is composed in the key of F minor. It incorporates R&amp;B, soul, and 1970s-style electronic dance music. The song&#x27;s tempo is a moderate beats per minute, in common time. Wash sang the lead vocals in the song. Wash&#x27;s vocal range spans around two octaves in the song, from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; uses one minor chord, F minor, with the rest of the notes in major chords.

==Release==
&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was first released to dance club DJs in the United States in mid-1982. The single was then released for 7&quot; single and 12&quot; single in the United States in 1982. Shortly after the release of the single, the Two Tons changed their name to the Weather Girls after much confusion by press and fans due to the duo introducing themselves as &quot;the weather girls&quot; in the introduction of the song. In 1993, a then-newly recorded version of &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was released by the Weather Girls, now composed of Armstead and her daughter Dynelle Rhodes, on their sixth album &quot;Double Tons of Fun&quot; (1993).

In 2005, a live version of the song was released on the Weather Girls&#x27; ninth album &quot;Totally Wild!&quot; This version features vocals by Dynelle Rhodes and then-newly added member Ingrid Arthur. In 2012, the same lineup of the Weather Girls released &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men - 2012&quot; (stylized as &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men 2K12&quot;). The song is based in the house music genre produced by Sebo Reed.

==Impact and legacy==

VH1 ranked the song at number 35 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs&quot; in 2000, and also at number 35 in their &quot;100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 1980s&quot; ranking in 2009. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked the song number 12 in their list of the &quot;60 Best Dancefloor Classics&quot; in February 2017. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it number 90 on their ranking of &quot;The 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time&quot; in 2020 and number 88 on their list of the &quot;200 Greatest Dance Songs of All Time&quot; in 2022.

&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; has often been perceived as a gay anthem. A campaign was launched on Facebook on January 19, 2014, to get the song to UK number one in response to a UKIP councillor blaming recent UK floods and adverse weather on divine retribution for the British government&#x27;s introduction of gay marriage. The campaign was reported widely by some press, and the Weather Girls&#x27; version reached number 21 on the first day of the chart week. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart in 2014 at number 31. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the song on their &quot;25 Essential LGBTQ Pride Songs&quot; list. In 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song at number 47 on their &quot;50 Best Gay Anthems of All Time&quot; list. &quot;The Gay UK&quot; ranked the song at number two on their &quot;Top 40 Gay Anthems for Pride&quot; list. &quot;Time Out&quot; ranked it number 19 on their list of &quot;The 50 Best Gay Songs to Celebrate Pride All Year Long&quot; in 2022.

In 1983, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best R&amp;B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal. In June 2017, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; entered on the Spotify Rewind charts and peaked at number one.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was a commercial success in the United States. The song spent a total of eleven weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100, ultimately peaking at forty-six on March 5, 1983. Although it had not yet been released to retail stores, the single gained much attention based on heavy rotation alone. On the chart dated December 24, 1982, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart and held the top position for a total of two weeks. The song spent a total of twenty-two weeks on the Dance chart. After eighteen weeks on the R&amp;B charts, &quot;It’s Raining Men&quot; peaked at number thirty-four. The song was also a huge success in the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, and became certified platinum for sales and streaming figures exceeding 600,000 units in the United Kingdom.

==Music video==
===Production===
The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, released in the winter of 1982, was directed by Gary Keys and filmed in an abandoned building in New York City. Due to limited support from Columbia Records, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was a low-budget video. Wash described the video&#x27;s conception: &quot;God, that was a cheesy video! We filmed it in an abandoned building [in NYC] in the dead of winter. There was no heat and everybody was wearing [winter] coats. That part in the video where we fall out of the sky, well, we landed on these mattresses and found out [the next day] they were infested with bugs. For days afterwards Izora and I were scratching [ourselves]! It was awful!&quot;

===Synopsis===
The opening sequence of the video features the Weather Girls in a news station. The duo give a forecast prediction that it will rain men from the sky. After looking out of the station window to see the sky raining men, the Weather Girls leap out of the window with their umbrellas to join the men. Several dancers are seen in the music video performing choreography. Another scene features the Weather Girls wearing lingerie on a heart-shaped bed surrounded by and being adored by men. The closing scene shows the duo performing with the male dancers and extras in the music video.

==Martha Wash and RuPaul version==
&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was covered by Weather Girls&#x27; member Martha Wash and American drag queen and singer RuPaul in 1997. The song was retitled &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men... The Sequel&quot;, and released as the lead single for Wash&#x27;s compilation album &quot;The Collection&quot; (1998). The song was also released on RuPaul&#x27;s &quot;Go-Go Box Classics&quot; (1998).

===Critical reception===
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that Wash &quot;sounds like she&#x27;s having a blast as she revisits a hit from her heyday as half of the Weather Girls.&quot; He noted that &quot;the novel hook of this new recording is the appearance of RuPaul, whose freewheeling vamps are saucy good fun.&quot; He also added that Producer Gary &quot;Headman&quot; Haas &quot;doesn&#x27;t deviate far from the original recording&#x27;s disco sound, leaving a posse of remixers to investigate a variety of more trendy ideas.&quot;

===Music video===
The opening sequence of the accompanying music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men... The Sequel&quot; features Wash and RuPaul as the news anchors of the Weather Center. The duo give a forecast prediction that it will rain men from the sky, with several field reporters also reporting similar information. Wash, as a meteorologist and weatherwoman, performs the song in front of a digital map. Several people from around the world start to feel the effects of the forecast and some women are even shown collecting men that fall from the sky into baskets. Several men also appear in the music video, dancing to the song.

&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men... The Sequel&quot;

==Geri Halliwell version==
&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was released on April 30, 2001, as the first single from British singer Geri Halliwell&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Scream if You Wanna Go Faster&quot; (2001). It was also featured as the lead single internationally to the soundtrack of the 2001 film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. The single became Halliwell&#x27;s fourth consecutive number-one hit single on the UK Singles Chart and became her most successful solo single to date.

===Background===
Halliwell commented: &quot;It was really odd because I was all ready to go with my new album. I had the single, I had the video idea all ready and then the producers of the movie said to me, &#x27;do you want to record It&#x27;s Raining Men for the soundtrack?&#x27; I thought it would be fun and I love Bridget Jones cos I&#x27;ve read both books and so I just did it really quickly. They all loved it and wanted it to be a single and I thought it was a bit of a gift, so I released it&quot;.

===Reception===
Halliwell&#x27;s version received positive reviews by music critics, experienced international success and hit the top ten in over two dozen countries around the world, going to number one in several of them. In the United Kingdom, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; debuted at number-one on the UK Singles Chart and stayed there for two weeks. It became Halliwell&#x27;s fourth consecutive number-one single in the UK, selling 155,000 units in its first week and 80,000 in its second week. Halliwell became the first solo British female artist to have four number-one singles in the United Kingdom, a record she held until 2014. Overall the single went on to sell 449,000 copies in Britain alone, becoming the 13th-best-seller of 2001 and Halliwell&#x27;s most successful single worldwide.

The song was successful outside the United Kingdom. In Flemish Belgium, the song stayed at number one for four weeks and was the best-selling single of 2001. The single reached number one in France for five weeks, receiving a Diamond certification from the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP). With this song, Halliwell won the &quot;International Song of the Year&quot; award at the 2002 NRJ Music Awards in France. The cover was also a major success in Walloon Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland.

A remix of the song, the Almighty Mix from the Toshiba-EMI series &quot;Dance Mania&quot;, volume 20, was also featured in the 2002 Japanese video games, DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution 7thMix and Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME. This version of the song was used as the theme song in the advertisements for New Talent Singing Awards Vancouver Audition 2003. In July 2006, the song entered at number 79 on the Mexican Digital Sales Chart, spending two weeks inside the Top 100.

===Music video===
Halliwell was inspired by the 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot; and by the 1983 film &quot;Flashdance&quot; for the video. It was directed by Jim Canty and Jake-Sebastian Wynne. The video stars Halliwell ready to dance in an audition for the judges and in the chorus, a big group of dancers join her. Near the end of the video, Halliwell and the dancers perform a dance routine in the rain.

===Live performances===

To promote the single, Halliwell performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Comet Awards&quot; 2001, &quot;Musica Sí&quot;, &quot;Big Brother Germany&quot;, &quot;Party in the Park&quot;, &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, &quot;Loft Story&quot;, &quot;Pepsi Chart Russia&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Tickled Pink&quot;. Halliwell also performed the song on The Return of the Spice Girls world tour as her solo number.

<doc id="1270981" wikidata="Q5288197" url="?curid=1270981" title="Dog Island (Florida)">
<text>Dog Island is located in the northwestern Florida Gulf coast, just off-shore from Carrabelle, in Franklin County, Florida. There is, by reservation, ferry transportation to Dog Island on weekends.

There are no stores, restaurants, or public restrooms on Dog Island. A hotel, the Pelican Inn, closed in 2016. The island is less than one mile wide at its widest, and just under seven miles long. The bulk of the island is owned by The Nature Conservancy and is a wilderness preserve. Bird nesting sites on several areas of the east end and west end of the island are strictly off-limits for people and pets. There is a volunteer fire department. Electricity and trash pickup are available.

Much of the island is within the Dog Island Conservation District, an independent special district and political subdivision of the State of Florida, created to guide development and help preserve the island.

The island is home to the Dog Island wren, a subspecies of the Carolina wren only found on Dog Island.

==Airport==
Dog Island Airport is an un-towered, private use airport located by the Eastern bay of Dog Island. The airport opened in 1930.

==Origin==
The island and its two small neighbors were discovered by the French in 1536 and named Dog Island, &quot;Isle des Chiens&quot;, because, according to different legends: 1) wild dogs were found on them; 2) the island resembles a crouched dog, or 3) the early ships put their common sailors — known as dogs — on the island before docking on the mainland so they could not jump ship. Later, the two neighbors were renamed: St. Vincent, which is a Federal wildlife refuge, and St. George, which has a causeway and an airport (FA43), has developed into a seaside vacation community with shops and beach rentals.

After World War II, Jeff Lewis, a Florida businessman, saw its potential as a vacation area and paid $12,000 for the island. Native Americans used Dog Island as a fishing camp, and the 1985 hurricanes uncovered potsherds on the west end of the island. 
==History==
Dog Island shows evidence of human presence dating back over 8,000 years. The island also has a rich maritime history. The discovery of a 9th-century canoe is a testament to prehistoric mariners on the island. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the barrier islands may have served as a haven for piracy and smuggling.

===18th century===
On February 16, 1766, &quot;Le Tigre&quot;, a French merchant brigantine, was en route to New Orleans and wrecked east of Dog Island in a great storm. A survivor, Monsieur Pierre Viaud, chronicled the experience in the best-selling narrative &quot;The Shipwreck and Adventures of Monsieur Pierre Viaud&quot;, published 1769 (and translated to English in 1771).

In 1799, the Royal Navy purchased HMS &quot;Fox&quot;, a 14-gun British schooner, only to see it wreck later that year between Dog and St. George Islands.

===19th century===
As part of the United States, economic shipping greatly increased as St. Marks, St. Joseph, and Apalachicola became major ports on the Gulf Coast. Both sail and steam ships traveled to Dog Island to exploit its resources of lumber and naval stores, such as turpentine and pitch products. In 1838, Dog Island Light was built on the western tip of the island.

During the Civil War, Dog Island was used by the Union Navy as a base for staging the blockade of Apalachicola.
On the first of August 1899, the 2nd hurricane of the season struck the area, almost destroying the town of Carrabelle, leaving just nine homes. Roughly 6 miles inland at McIntyre, only two mill boilers were left. The summer resort of Lanark Inn was said to be &quot;blown into the Gulf&quot;. The Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad was destroyed for a distance of 30 miles, and a locomotive was displaced some 100 yards off the track.

Up to fifteen ships were wrecked (some permanently destroyed), 12 loaded with lumber. Although contemporary documents sometimes have conflicting information as to the names and nationalities of these ships, they are believed to include:

*American ships
**, a schooner, under the command of Capt. Cottingham.
**&quot;Mary E. Morse&quot; a schooner, under the command of Capt. Densmore.
**, a schooner under the command of Capt. McClean.
**&quot;Grace Andrews&quot;, a schooner under the command of Capt. Brown.
**&quot;Warren Adams&quot;, a schooner under the command of Capt. Gibbons
**&quot;Vidette&quot;, a barkentine under the command of Capt. Waldren.
**&quot;Capitola&quot;, a steamship
**&quot;Iola&quot;, a steamship
**&quot;Albert Haley,&quot; a fishing smack.

*Norwegian ships
** &quot;Ranavola&quot;, bark under the command of Capt. Edwardson.
**&quot;Vale&quot;, a bark, under the command of Capt. Andersen (this shipwreck has been identified by archaeologists).
**&quot;Elsbeth&quot;, a bark under the command of Capt. Pedersen.
**&quot;Jafnhar&quot;, a bark under the command of Capt. Tygensen.
**&quot;Hindoo&quot;, a bark under the command of Capt. Madsen.
*Russian ships:
**&quot;Latara&quot;, a bark under the command of Capt. Krantman
*Italian ships
**&quot;Corteria&quot;, a bark which was split in half

Another 40 ships under 20 tons were sunk or destroyed.

===20th century===
During World War II, Dog Island was part of Camp Gordon Johnston. Four separate camps comprised the complex: three for regimental combat teams, and the fourth for the headquarters and support facilities. Dog Island was used for amphibious landings and airdrops.

An archaeological research project, the Dog Island Shipwreck Survey, was initiated in 1999 by Florida State University researcher Chuck Meide to systematically search the waters off Dog Island, using acoustic and electromagnetic devices, to discover historic shipwrecks. Project archaeologists conducted excavations on the wreck of the 1899 Norwegian lumber ship &quot;Vale&quot; mentioned above, and also located a number of other submerged archaeological sites, including the ruins of the Dog Island Lighthouse, using sonar and magnetometer.

===21st century===
After Hurricane Michael of 2018, portions of two more shipwrecks likely from the 1899 hurricane wrecking event re-emerged from the sand.

<text>Taijin kyofusho (, TKS, for &quot;taijin kyofusho symptoms&quot;) is a Japanese culture-specific syndrome. The term &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; translates into the disorder (&quot;sho&quot;) of fear (&quot;kyofu&quot;) of interpersonal relations (&quot;taijin&quot;). Those who have &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; are likely to be extremely embarrassed about themselves or fearful of displeasing others when it comes to the functions of their bodies or their appearances. These bodily functions and appearances include their faces, odor, actions, or looks. They do not want to embarrass other people with their presence. This culture-bound syndrome is a social phobia based on fear and anxiety.

The symptoms of this disorder include avoiding social outings and activities, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, panic attacks, trembling, and feelings of dread and panic when around people. The causes of this disorder are mainly from emotional trauma or psychological defense mechanism. It is more common in men than women. Lifetime prevalence is estimated at 3–13%.

==Subcategories==
&quot;Taijin kyofusho&quot; is commonly described as a form of social anxiety (social phobia), with the person dreading and avoiding social contact, and as a subtype of &quot;shinkeishitsu&quot; (anxiety disorder). However, instead of a fear of embarrassing themselves or being harshly judged by others because of their social ineptness, sufferers of &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; report a fear of offending or harming other people. The focus is thus on avoiding harm to others rather than to oneself.

In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) it is instead considered a sub-category of the &quot;Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder&quot; category [300.3 (F42)], where variants of taijin kyofusho are &quot;Shubo-kyofu [...] that is similar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity&quot; and &quot;Jikoshu-kyofu [...] characterized by fear of having an offensive body odor&quot;.

The revised edition of the DSM-5 even breaks &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; down into two different subtypes: sensitive and offensive. The first subtype can be broken into two parts that are classical type and avoidant type. The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety. The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors. The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive. Some of their fears include body odor, gas, excessive or insufficient eye contact, blushing, etc. 

In the official Japanese diagnostic system, &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; is subdivided into the following categories:

* Sekimen-kyofu (), the phobia of blushing (ereuthophobia)
* Shubo-kyofu (), the phobia of a deformed body, similar to body dysmorphic disorder
* Jikoshisen-kyofu (), the phobia of eye contact
* Jikoshu-kyofu (), the phobia of having foul body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome, osmophobia or bromidrosiphobia)

Japanese psychologists also recognize additional types of &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; based on severity:

* Transient: This type of &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; is short-lived and moderately severe. It most commonly appears in teens, but may occur at any time.
* Delusional: This is the most common type of &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; and is the most similar to social phobia. It is chronic, often begins before the age of 30, and varies in severity from moderate to severe.
* Phobic with schizophrenia: This is a more complicated disorder. In such cases, rather than a phobia, &quot;taijin kyofusho&quot; is a manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.

==Diagnosis==
A person may be diagnosed with taijin kyofusho if they feel as if their attitudes, behavior, and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations. As a result of these feelings, they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through shame, embarrassment, anxiety, fear, and other tense feelings that occur when confronted with social circumstances. In addition, individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others. When it comes to socializing, taijin kyofusho sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations, while simultaneously being averse to doing so. Those likely to develop taijin kyofusho have more of a temperamental characteristic of being hypochondriacal. The balance between introversion and extroversion in hypochondriacal temperament is geared more towards introversion. The introversion causes sufferers to focus on themself and problems they have, and by fixating on their weaknesses they become more anxious and depressed.

==Treatment==

The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is Morita therapy, developed by Shoma Morita in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu (nervousness). The original regimen involved patient isolation, enforced bed rest, diary writing, manual labor, and lectures on the importance of self-acceptance and positive endeavor. Since the 1930s, the treatment has been modified to include out-patient and group treatments. This modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy. Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho. Other treatments include systematic desensitization, which includes slowly exposing one self to the fear, and learning relaxation skills, to extinguish fear and anxiety.

Milnacipran, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for the related social anxiety disorder. The primary aspect of treating this disorder is getting patients to focus their attention on their body parts and sensations.

==Prevalence==
Typically, this disease is presaged by a childhood history of social inhibition and shyness. It is possible that it could result from a humiliating traumatic experience, or it could emerge from a lifelong onset of the illness that only comes to the surface after time.

Clinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females, despite the fact that females scored higher on a social phobia scale than men, and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment. This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males. In addition, studies have found that the disorder is common in older generations. The lifetime prevalence of the disorder falls anywhere between 3% and 13% with changes in severity occurring throughout one&#x27;s lifetime. It is estimated that about 17% of individuals with taijin kyofusho have fears of releasing foul body odor. Although sometimes undiagnosed, symptoms of taijin kyofusho are not uncommon in Japan.

<text>Glen Williams is a hamlet in Halton Hills, Halton Regional Municipality, Ontario, Canada. It has a population of about 2700 people and its closest neighbours are Georgetown and Terra Cotta.

Glen Williams is noted for its visual artists, artist&#x27;s studios, heritage buildings, a restaurant and bakery, a community centre (Town Hall), parks, churches and homes. The Credit River flow through the hamlet, providing a habitat for animals.

==History==
In the fall of 1824, a grant of in the township of Esquesing was made by the Crown to John Butler Muirhead. The land was eventually sold for £100 to Benajah Williams.

The Credit River was used to run saw and flour mills. By 1833, Williams had purchased another 200-acre parcel, giving him the that became Glen Williams. The Williams&#x27; Mill is where the first industry stood, a saw mill built by Benajah and sons Joel and Charles in 1825. Charles Williams became the leading figure in the community, and by the mid-1860s, he was proprietor of the flour, woollen, and saw mills, as well as a justice of the peace in Williamsburg.

A second sawmill in the village was operated from 1856 by Joseph Tweddle, and a third saw mill was on &quot;the Mountain,&quot; run by steam, erected by Charles Symons of Acton, and leased to and run by Cooper and sons of the Glen. It burned down in the summer of 1876.

Members of the Williams family worked as a blacksmith, cabinetmaker, leather tanner, and general store proprietor. Jacob Williams opened a woolen mill in 1839.

===Glen Woollen Mills===

A woollen mill, built of wood, was erected in 1839 by Jacob Williams. When he died in 1853, his elder brother Charles took over the property. The building also housed Brown&#x27;s Pump Factory and Bradshaw&#x27;s Comb Factory. The building was destroyed by fire in 1867. In 1877, Charles Williams bought the bobbin factory.

After a fire in 1867, Charles Williams erected a new stone mill. The building was finished, but fire struck again in 1875. Charles&#x27; son Benajah became the proprietor, and rebuilt it two-and-a-half stories and powered by a 40-horsepower Leffel water wheel. The building was heated by steam and equipped with a system of waterworks for quenching fires. It employmed 50 to 60 people directly, and used of Canadian wool daily. The mill bought the latest cards, spinning machines, twisters, and Knitting machines built by Davis and Furber in Northampton, Massachusetts. The rebuilding and re-equipping cost $32,000. By 1877, Ben Williams had failed and run away. His debts had risen to the cost of rebuilding the factory and more, and in January 1878, the &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; advertised the sale of the mill. His brother Joseph purchased the mill.

In 1894, the mill was operated by the Sykes and Ainley Manufacturing Company.

The Glen Woollen Mills Company was organized in 1907 to carry on the business. The looms wove grey blankets, robe linings, fancy buggy rugs, wool horse blankets, kersey, collar check, carpet and knitting yarns.

About this same time, the Melrose Knitting Company was set up as a subsidiary. It produced about 45,000 dozen pairs of men&#x27;s wool socks and lumberman&#x27;s socks a year. Sixty to seventy people worked there, and a hundred could have been employed if they could be found. Because of the shortage of labour, twelve English automatic machines were installed; and with the care of two boys, they knit 60 dozen pairs of socks a day. The mill was run by water power, though a 100-horsepower boiler and engine used for heating and drying could provide emergency power; and their own dynamo produced the electricity to run delicate machinery and lighting.&quot; After Barraclough&#x27;s death, the mill passed through a number of operators, and was destroyed by fire in 1954.

===Beaumont Knitting Mill===
An Irish millwright named James Bradley bought the old Tweedle Saw Mill upstream from Benjah, along with five carding machines and the largest picker.

The Dominion Glove Works also producing a 200 dozen pairs of socks daily, which would sell at 25 to 50 cents a pair, and about 40 dozen pairs of mitts and gloves, selling at 50 cents to a dollar. The mill employed 80 to 100 workers. In 1982, the mill was sold and closed. Beaumont Mill Antiques and Collectibles is now located there.

===Heritage buildings===

* The original Williams saw mill, now the Williams Mill Arts Centre.
* Glen Williams Town Hall, first used for a board meeting in 1870, has been used by numerous societies, churches, and political meetings, and acted as a polling station for elections. In the 20th century, the hall provided the stage for dances and Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery, who staged many works there with her Union Dramatic Players. It also served briefly as a school.
* Laidlaw House, the Frazier Shop, the Williams Chair Factory (Williams-Holt House), and the Beaumont Knitting Mill.
* Reeve and Clarke Fine and Rare Books, an antiquarian book business that sells second-hand books. The store is located in the storefront of Laidlaw House and the Frazier Shop in which Timothy Eaton first worked in retail.

Beyond the designated heritage properties, more than 35 other properties in Glen Williams are listed in the Town of Halton Hills Heritage Register.

==Arts and culture==
Famed Group of Seven artist A. J. Casson often spent summers in Glen Williams, which he used as a base to paint local scenes.

The village itself is the subject of Casson&#x27;s 1938 oil on canvas, &quot;Street in Glen Williams&quot;, a leafy, autumnal portrait of a quiet road in the hamlet, which sold at auction in Toronto on June 1, 2010 for a record $542,800, including buyer&#x27;s premium, the highest such valuation ever accorded a Casson canvas. Casson, who joined the Group of Seven in 1926, &quot;recorded small towns in every season,&quot; Canadian art critic and historian Paul Duval wrote in 1980, &quot;and Street in Glen Williams is unquestionably his key autumn portrayal.&quot; Other paintings of Casson&#x27;s time in and around Glen Williams include &quot;Country Road - Glen Williams&quot;, &quot;Village Street October&quot;, and &quot;Farmhouse near Glen Williams 1938&quot;, now in the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art at The Ottawa Art Gallery.

Today Glen Williams is a predominantly residential community that provides housing for residents employed in other areas. Glen Williams is home to many visual artists, contains a collection of artist&#x27;s studios and is a major draw to the area. Glen Williams has a compact community core that includes commercial uses, a restaurant and bakery, the community centre (Town Hall) and other recreational and community functions. This hamlet core is viewed as an important component of the hamlet character. All commercial and community uses are focused in this area.

&quot;The Williams Mill Visual Arts Centre&quot; and &quot;Glen Williams Glass&quot; are both housed in the heritage site of the Williams Mill. The Williams Mill provides studio space for artists of various media including ceramics, drawing, fibre, glass, jewellery, printmaking, sculpture and offers visitors the opportunity to interact directly with the artists, experience their work in progress and purchase a variety of art. The gallery showcases the works of other renowned artists and craftspeople. Art classes, lectures and workshops for all ages offered year-round in the Arts Education Centre. Glen Williams Glass is a collective studio made up of seven independent glass artists and is also part of The Williams Mill. In addition to its function as an artist&#x27;s co-operative, Glen Williams Glass regularly welcomes non-members to the studio.

The former Beaumont Knitting Mill is now home to &quot;Beaumont Mill Antiques &amp; Collectibles&quot;, a multi vendor Antique and Collectibles Market offering a broad assortment of collectibles and antiques, including furniture, toys, glassware, cookware, books, decorative items, and vinyl records. Adjacent to the mill is the &quot;Kids &amp; Classics Boatshops Museum&quot;, a non-profit organization, which focuses on the restoration of classic wood boats, where volunteers learn and teach skills, working with kids-at-risk through a skiff building program for youth. In the space of a weekend, four children build and launch a skiff (the Bevin&#x27;s skiff), get exposed to the world of boatbuilding and learn to have confidence in themselves and what they can do. Sale of the skiffs built by the youth helps fund the program.

&quot;Sheridan Nurseries&quot; operates their &quot;Glen Williams Farm &amp; Distribution Centre&quot; along the hamlet&#x27;s eastern boundary. The farm is their main growing facility and produces more than 800 hardy nursery stock varieties, ranging from evergreens, deciduous trees and shrubs. The Distribution Centre supplies its own nine garden centres in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and ships regularly to destinations in Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest to New England. Sheridan Nurseries has been selected as the Glen Williams Citizen of the Year in 2007, 2010 &amp; 2011.

===Annual festivals and events===
* Victoria Day - Fireworks and BBQ
* Canada Day (July 1) - Parade, duck race, festival grounds, evening BBQ and fireworks

==Attractions==

Three churches serve the village. &quot;St. Alban the Martyr Anglican Church&quot;, and &quot;St. John&#x27;s United Church&quot; are historic buildings still used for worship, and are located on either side of the Credit River on Main Street. Despite the bishop&#x27;s suggestion that the Glen people would be better off continuing to attend church in Georgetown, the cornerstone of St. Alban the Martyr was laid in 1902, and the church opened in June of following year. The architect was F. S. Baker, the son of a woollen miller in Kilbride, and a friend of Joseph Beaumont. F.S. Baker would later become the second President of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada from 1910–1912.

&quot;Union Presbyterian Church&quot; is located north-east of the village at Winston Churchill.

===Glen Williams Park===
Glen Williams Park, 509 Main Street. &quot;Glen Williams Minor Softball&quot;, still played in the park, was established in 1964 by the local hamlet&#x27;s people. As the need increased for a place to play ball, the land where the park is located today was donated to Glen Minor Ball. The Glen organizers built a major diamond, a concession stand and a minor diamond. The major diamond and booth are still here today.
The park, now maintained by Town of Halton Hills staff, includes baseball diamonds, park pavilion, and flower gardens. Open for public use to have a picnic, organize a friendly game of baseball or listen to the sounds of Credit River flowing by.

===Glen Williams Cemetery===

The 1840 deed to the Methodist Episcopal church in Glen Williams provided a site for &quot;a Church Meeting-House or Chapel and Burying-ground.&quot; But the spot down by the river was not an appropriate place for burials, and it does not appear that any took place there.

In the Glen the Williams family chose a spot on the hill, overlooking the village, for use as a family cemetery. The earliest stone marks the resting-place of Ira, Elizabeth and Benajah&#x27;s son, who died in 1833 just eleven days after his fifteenth birthday. Another son, George, lies nearby; he died in 1836, also at the age of 23. A grandson, Alfred (Joel&#x27;s boy) died in 1844.
Others besides the family used the cemetery. There is a memorial to Robert Brown, who died in 1834. That is on a stone that was put up in 1876, and it is uncertain whether he is buried there. But near the Williams plot there are stones from 1845, for Latham Stull, and for Margaret, wife of Jacob Stull. Benajah Williams died on November 22, 1851. His son Charles must have felt that the time had come for the cemetery to be established on a more regular basis, and on December 22 he made over the land for a public burying-ground, &quot;in consideration of the sum of one shilling of lawful money of the Province of Canada to him in hand paid.&quot; His brother Joel (now described as a carpenter, rather than a blacksmith as in an earlier deed) and another brother Jacob, were among the first trustees. The others were John Cook and John Stull, yeoman, and Thomas B. Frasier, tailor.

The original grant was of one acre, but with the passage of time, more land came to be needed. The oldest section bordered on the road, and is easily distinguished by the old limestone markers in it. In 1905 the Sykes and Ainley mill donated the piece of land between it and the top of the bank of the hill above the river. A further piece was bought for $30 in 1919. It was purchased from John Haines (1870-1932), a native of Somerset, who purchased Fred Cook&#x27;s orchard and farm next to the cemetery. Then in 1957 Sheridan Nurseries gave a further piece to the cemetery board.

The Glen Williams Cemetery continues today as a community cemetery governed by a volunteer Board Of Directors. They do not receive government funding or maintenance assistance but rely on private donations.

==Education==
&quot;Glen Williams Public School&quot;, located at 512 Main Street, is a Junior Kindergarten to Grade 5 Elementary School, with a school library and gymnasium and a large outdoor play area next to the Credit River. Governed by the Halton District School Board with input from the local Glen Williams Parent Council, it is currently home to approximately 220 children. The first frame (as distinct from log) school in the township was built in Glen Williams 1837, replaced by a large, one-room building in 1852. The present school is now housed in a modern building which has seen many additions since it was first erected in the 1950s. This school replaced the overcrowded two-room brick school on Prince Street, which was built in 1873 and has since been converted into a private residence. The Glen Williams Public School also houses before and after school programs in cooperation with the Halton Hills Glen Williams YMCA Centre, a licensed child care centre.

&quot;The Village Montessori &amp; Child Care&quot; is located in Glen Williams at 533 Main Street and is locally owned and operated. Offering a true Montessori Toddler program as well as Casa and School Age programs, accepting all children 15 months to 12 years of age, also offering Mommy and Me programs for infants and toddlers.

<doc id="1271003" wikidata="Q937624" url="?curid=1271003" title="Five prime untranslated region">
<text>The 5′ untranslated region (also known as 5′ UTR, leader sequence, transcript leader, or leader RNA) is the region of a messenger RNA (mRNA) that is directly upstream from the initiation codon. This region is important for the regulation of translation of a transcript by differing mechanisms in viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Despite its name, the 5′ UTR, or a portion of it is sometimes translated into a protein product. This product may involve in regulation of transcription, and translation of the main coding sequence of the mRNA, such as the sex-lethal gene in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. Regulatory elements within 5′ UTRs have also been linked to mRNA export. In many organisms, however, the 5′ UTR is completely untranslated, instead forming a complex secondary structure to regulate translation.

The 5′ UTR begins at the transcription start site and ends one nucleotide (nt) before the initiation sequence (usually AUG) of the coding region. In prokaryotes, the length of the 5′ UTR tends to be 3–10 nucleotides long, while in eukaryotes it tends to be anywhere from 100 to several thousand nucleotides long. For example, the &quot;ste11&quot; transcript in &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; has a 2273 nucleotide 5′ UTR while the &quot;lac&quot; operon in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; only has seven nucleotides in its 5′ UTR. The differing sizes are likely due to the complexity of the eukaryotic regulation which the 5′ UTR holds as well as the larger pre-initiation complex that must form to begin translation.

The 5′ UTR can also be completely missing, in the case of leaderless mRNAs. Ribosomes of all three domains of life accept and translate such mRNAs. Such sequences are naturally found in all three domains of life. Humans have many pressure-related genes under a 2–3 nucleotide leader. Mammals also have other types of ultra-short leaders like the TISU sequence.

=== Elements ===
The elements of a eukaryotic and prokaryotic 5′ UTR differ greatly. The prokaryotic 5′ UTR contains a ribosome binding site (RBS), also known as the Shine–Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGGU), which is usually 3–10 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon. In contrast, the eukaryotic 5′ UTR contains the Kozak consensus sequence (ACCAUGG), which contains the initiation codon. The eukaryotic 5′ UTR also contains &quot;cis&quot;-acting regulatory elements called upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and termination codons, which have a great impact on the regulation of translation (see below). Unlike prokaryotes, 5′ UTRs can harbor introns in eukaryotes. In humans, ~35% of all genes harbor introns within the 5′ UTR.

=== Secondary structure ===
As the 5′ UTR has high GC content, secondary structures often occur within it. Hairpin loops are one such secondary structure that can be located within the 5′ UTR. These secondary structures also impact the regulation of translation.

== Role in translational regulation ==

=== Prokaryotes ===

In bacteria, the initiation of translation occurs when IF-3, along with the 30S ribosomal subunit, bind to the Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the 5′ UTR. This then recruits many other proteins, such as the 50S ribosomal subunit, which allows for translation to begin. Each of these steps regulates the initiation of translation.

Initiation in Archaea is less understood. SD sequences are much rarer, and the initiation factors have more in common with eukaryotic ones. There is no homolog of bacterial IF3. Some mRNAs are leaderless.

In both domains, genes without Shine–Dalgarno sequences are also translated in a less understood manner. A requirement seems to be a lack of secondary structure near the initiation codon.

=== Eukaryotes ===

==== Pre-initiation complex regulation ====
The regulation of translation in eukaryotes is more complex than in prokaryotes. Initially, the eIF4F complex is recruited to the 5′ cap, which in turn recruits the ribosomal complex to the 5′ UTR. Both eIF4E and eIF4G bind the 5′ UTR, which limits the rate at which translational initiation can occur. However, this is not the only regulatory step of translation that involves the 5′ UTR.

RNA-binding proteins sometimes serve to prevent the pre-initiation complex from forming. An example is regulation of the &quot;msl2&quot; gene. The protein SXL attaches to an intron segment located within the 5′ UTR segment of the primary transcript, which leads to the inclusion of the intron after processing. This sequence allows the recruitment of proteins that bind simultaneously to both the 5′ and 3′ UTR, not allowing translation proteins to assemble. However, it has also been noted that SXL can also repress translation of RNAs that do not contain a poly(A) tail, or more generally, 3′ UTR.

==== Closed-loop regulation ====
Another important regulator of translation is the interaction between 3′ UTR and the 5′ UTR.

The closed-loop structure inhibits translation. This has been observed in &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot;, in which eIF4E bound to the 5′ cap interacts with Maskin bound to CPEB on the 3′ UTR, creating translationally inactive transcripts. This translational inhibition is lifted once CPEB is phosphorylated, displacing the Maskin binding site, allowing for the polymerization of the PolyA tail, which can recruit the translational machinery by means of PABP. However, it is important to note that this mechanism has been under great scrutiny.

==== Ferritin regulation ====

Iron levels in cells are maintained by translation regulation of many proteins involved in iron storage and metabolism. The 5′ UTR has the ability to form a hairpin loop secondary structure (known as the iron response element or IRE) that is recognized by iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). In low levels of iron, the ORF of the target mRNA is blocked as a result of steric hindrance from the binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to the IRE. When iron is high, then the two iron-regulatory proteins do not bind as strongly and allow proteins to be expressed that have a role in iron concentration control. This function has gained some interest after it was revealed that the translation of amyloid precursor protein may be disrupted due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism to the IRE found in the 5′ UTR of its mRNA, leading to a spontaneous increased risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==== uORFs and reinitiation====

Another form of translational regulation in eukaryotes comes from unique elements on the 5′ UTR called upstream open reading frames (uORF). These elements are fairly common, occurring in 35–49% of all human genes. A uORF is a coding sequence located in the 5′ UTR located upstream of the coding sequences initiation site. These uORFs contain their own initiation codon, known as an upstream AUG (uAUG). This codon can be scanned for by ribosomes and then translated to create a product, which can regulate the translation of the main protein coding sequence or other uORFs that may exist on the same transcript.

The translation of the protein within the main ORF after a uORF sequence has been translated is known as reinitiation. The process of reinitiation is known to reduce the translation of the ORF protein. Control of protein regulation is determined by the distance between the uORF and the first codon in the main ORF. A uORF has been found to increase reinitiation with the longer distance between its uAUG and the start codon of the main ORF, which indicates that the ribosome needs to reacquire translation factors before it can carry out translation of the main protein. For example, &quot;ATF4&quot; regulation is performed by two uORFs further upstream, named uORF1 and uORF2, which contain three amino acids and fifty-nine amino acids, respectively. The location of uORF2 overlaps with the &quot;ATF4&quot; ORF. During normal conditions, the uORF1 is translated, and then translation of uORF2 occurs only after eIF2-TC has been reacquired. Translation of the uORF2 requires that the ribosomes pass by the &quot;ATF4&quot; ORF, whose start codon is located within uORF2. This leads to its repression. However, during stress conditions, the 40S ribosome will bypass uORF2 because of a decrease in concentration of eIF2-TC, which means the ribosome does not acquire one in time to translate uORF2. Instead, &quot;ATF4&quot; is translated.

===== Other mechanisms =====
In addition to reinitiation, uORFs contribute to translation initiation based on:
* The nucleotides of an uORF may code for a codon that leads to a highly structured mRNA, causing the ribosome to stall.
* cis- and trans- regulation on translation of the main protein coding sequence.
* Interactions with IRES sites.

==== Internal ribosome entry sites and viruses ====

Viral (as well as some eukaryotic) 5′ UTRs contain internal ribosome entry sites, which is a cap-independent method of translational activation. Instead of building up a complex at the 5′ cap, the IRES allows for direct binding of the ribosomal complexes to the transcript to begin translation. The IRES enables the viral transcript to translate more efficiently due to the lack of needing a preinitation complex, allowing the virus to replicate quickly.

== Role in transcriptional regulation ==

=== &quot;msl-2&quot; transcript===
Transcription of the &quot;msl-2&quot; transcript is regulated by multiple binding sites for fly &quot;Sxl&quot; at the 5′ UTR. In particular, these poly-uracil sites are located close to a small intron that is spliced in males, but kept in females through splicing inhibition. This splicing inhibition is maintained by &quot;Sxl&quot;. When present, &quot;Sxl&quot; will repress the translation of &quot;msl2&quot; by increasing translation of a start codon located in a uORF in the 5′ UTR (see above for more information on uORFs). Also, &quot;Sxl&quot; outcompetes TIA-1 to a poly(U) region and prevents snRNP (a step in alternative splicing) recruitment to the 5′ splice site.

<text>Specified complexity is a creationist argument introduced by William Dembski, used by advocates to promote the pseudoscience of intelligent design. According to Dembski, the concept can formalize a property that singles out patterns that are both &quot;specified&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;, where in Dembski&#x27;s terminology, a &quot;specified&quot; pattern is one that admits short descriptions, whereas a &quot;complex&quot; pattern is one that is unlikely to occur by chance. An example cited by Dembski is a poker hand, where for example the repeated appearance of a royal flush will raise suspicion of cheating. Proponents of intelligent design use specified complexity as one of their two main arguments, along with irreducible complexity.

Dembski argues that it is impossible for specified complexity to exist in patterns displayed by configurations formed by unguided processes. Therefore, Dembski argues, the fact that specified complex patterns can be found in living things indicates some kind of guidance in their formation, which is indicative of intelligence. Dembski further argues that one can show by applying no-free-lunch theorems the inability of evolutionary algorithms to select or generate configurations of high specified complexity. Dembski states that specified complexity is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent—a central tenet to intelligent design, which Dembski argues for in opposition to modern evolutionary theory. Specified complexity is what Dembski terms an &quot;explanatory filter&quot;: one can recognize design by detecting complex specified information (CSI). Dembski argues that the unguided emergence of CSI solely according to known physical laws and chance is highly improbable.

The concept of specified complexity is widely regarded as mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, in the theory of complex systems, or in biology. A study by Wesley Elsberry and Jeffrey Shallit states: &quot;Dembski&#x27;s work is riddled with inconsistencies, equivocation, flawed use of mathematics, poor scholarship, and misrepresentation of others&#x27; results.&quot; Another objection concerns Dembski&#x27;s calculation of probabilities. According to Martin Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and evolutionary biology, &quot;We cannot calculate the probability that an eye came about. We don&#x27;t have the information to make the calculation.&quot;

==Definition==

===Orgel&#x27;s terminology===
The term &quot;specified complexity&quot; was originally coined by origin of life researcher Leslie Orgel in his 1973 book &quot;The Origins of Life: Molecules and Natural Selection&quot;, which proposed that RNA could have evolved through Darwinian natural selection. Orgel used the phrase in discussing the differences between life and non-living structures:

In brief, living organisms are distinguished by their &quot;specified&quot; complexity. Crystals are usually taken as the prototypes of simple well-specified structures, because they consist of a very large number of identical molecules packed together in a uniform way. Lumps of granite or random mixtures of polymers are examples of structures that are complex but not specified. The crystals fail to qualify as living because they lack complexity; the mixtures of polymers fail to qualify because they lack specificity.

The phrase was taken up by the creationists Charles Thaxton and Walter L Bradley in a chapter they contributed to the 1994 book &quot;The Creation Hypothesis&quot; where they discussed &quot;design detection&quot; and redefined &quot;specified complexity&quot; as a way of measuring information. Another contribution to the book was written by William A. Dembski, who took this up as the basis of his subsequent work.

The term was later employed by physicist Paul Davies to qualify the complexity of living organisms:

Living organisms are mysterious not for their complexity per se, but for their tightly specified complexity

===Dembski&#x27;s definition===
Whereas Orgel used the term for biological features which are considered in science to have arisen through a process of evolution, Dembski says that it describes features which cannot form through &quot;undirected&quot; evolution—and concludes that it allows one to infer intelligent design. While Orgel employed the concept in a qualitative way, Dembski&#x27;s use is intended to be quantitative. Dembski&#x27;s use of the concept dates to his 1998 monograph &quot;The Design Inference&quot;. Specified complexity is fundamental to his approach to intelligent design, and each of his subsequent books has also dealt significantly with the concept. He has stated that, in his opinion, &quot;if there is a way to detect design, specified complexity is it&quot;.

Dembski asserts that specified complexity is present in a configuration when it can be described by a pattern that displays a large amount of independently specified information and is also complex, which he defines as having a low probability of occurrence. He provides the following examples to demonstrate the concept: &quot;A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A Shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified.&quot;

In his earlier papers Dembski defined &quot;complex specified information&quot; (CSI) as being present in a specified event whose probability did not exceed 1 in 10150, which he calls the universal probability bound. In that context, &quot;specified&quot; meant what in later work he called &quot;pre-specified&quot;, that is specified by the unnamed designer before any information about the outcome is known. The value of the universal probability bound corresponds to the inverse of the upper limit of &quot;the total number of [possible] specified events throughout cosmic history&quot;, as calculated by Dembski.
Anything below this bound has CSI. The terms &quot;specified complexity&quot; and &quot;complex specified information&quot; are used interchangeably. In more recent papers Dembski has redefined the universal probability bound, with reference to another number, corresponding to the total number of bit operations that could possibly have been performed in the entire history of the universe.

Dembski asserts that CSI exists in numerous features of living things, such as in DNA and in other functional biological molecules, and argues that it cannot be generated by the only known natural mechanisms of physical law and chance, or by their combination. He argues that this is so because laws can only shift around or lose information, but do not produce it, and because chance can produce complex unspecified information, or simple specified information, but not CSI; he provides a mathematical analysis that he claims demonstrates that law and chance working together cannot generate CSI, either. Moreover, he claims that CSI is holistic, with the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, and that this decisively eliminates Darwinian evolution as a possible means of its &quot;creation&quot;. Dembski maintains that by process of elimination, CSI is best explained as being due to intelligence, and is therefore a reliable indicator of design.

==Law of conservation of information==
Dembski formulates and proposes a law of conservation of information as follows:

This strong proscriptive claim, that natural causes can only transmit CSI but never originate it, I call the Law of Conservation of Information.

Immediate corollaries of the proposed law are the following:
# The specified complexity in a closed system of natural causes remains constant or decreases.
# The specified complexity cannot be generated spontaneously, originate endogenously or organize itself (as these terms are used in origins-of-life research).
# The specified complexity in a closed system of natural causes either has been in the system eternally or was at some point added exogenously (implying that the system, though now closed, was not always closed).
# In particular any closed system of natural causes that is also of finite duration received whatever specified complexity it contains before it became a closed system.
Dembski notes that the term &quot;Law of Conservation of Information&quot; was previously used by Peter Medawar in his book The Limits of Science (1984) &quot;to describe the weaker claim that deterministic laws cannot produce novel information.&quot; The actual validity and utility of Dembski&#x27;s proposed law are uncertain; it is neither widely used by the scientific community nor cited in mainstream scientific literature. A 2002 essay by Erik Tellgren provided a mathematical rebuttal of Dembski&#x27;s law and concludes that it is &quot;mathematically unsubstantiated.&quot;

==Specificity==

In a more recent paper, Dembski provides an account which he claims is simpler and adheres more closely to the theory of statistical hypothesis testing as formulated by Ronald Fisher. In general terms, Dembski proposes to view design inference as a statistical test to reject a chance hypothesis P on a space of outcomes Ω.

Dembski&#x27;s proposed test is based on the Kolmogorov complexity of a pattern &quot;T&quot; that is exhibited by an event &quot;E&quot; that has occurred. Mathematically, &quot;E&quot; is a subset of Ω, the pattern &quot;T&quot; specifies a set of outcomes in Ω and &quot;E&quot; is a subset of &quot;T&quot;. Quoting Dembski
Thus, the event &quot;E&quot; might be a die toss that lands six and &quot;T&quot; might be the composite event consisting of all die tosses that land on an even face.
Kolmogorov complexity provides a measure of the computational resources needed to specify a pattern (such as a DNA sequence or a sequence of alphabetic characters). Given a pattern &quot;T&quot;, the number of other patterns may have Kolmogorov complexity no larger than that of &quot;T&quot; is denoted by φ(&quot;T&quot;). The number φ(&quot;T&quot;) thus provides a ranking of patterns from the simplest to the most complex. For example, for a pattern &quot;T&quot; which describes the bacterial flagellum, Dembski claims to obtain the upper bound φ(&quot;T&quot;) ≤ 1020.

Dembski defines specified complexity of the pattern &quot;T&quot; under the chance hypothesis P as

:formula_1

where P(&quot;T&quot;) is the probability of observing the pattern &quot;T&quot;, &quot;R&quot; is the number of &quot;replicational resources&quot; available &quot;to witnessing agents&quot;. &quot;R&quot; corresponds roughly to repeated attempts to create and discern a pattern. Dembski then asserts that &quot;R&quot; can be bounded by 10120. This number is supposedly justified by a result of Seth Lloyd in which he determines that the number of elementary logic operations that can have been performed in the universe over its entire history cannot exceed 10120 operations on 1090 bits.

Dembski&#x27;s main claim is that the following test can be used to infer design for a configuration: There is a target pattern &quot;T&quot; that applies to the configuration and whose specified complexity exceeds 1. This condition can be restated as the inequality
:formula_2

===Dembski&#x27;s explanation of specified complexity===

Dembski&#x27;s expression σ is unrelated to any known concept in information theory, though he claims he can justify its relevance as follows: An intelligent agent &quot;S&quot; witnesses an event &quot;E&quot; and assigns it to some reference class of events Ω and within this reference class considers it as satisfying a specification &quot;T&quot;. Now consider the quantity φ(&quot;T&quot;) × P(&quot;T&quot;) (where P is the &quot;chance&quot; hypothesis):

Think of S as trying to determine whether an archer, who has just shot an arrow at a large wall, happened to hit a tiny target on that wall by chance. The arrow, let us say, is indeed sticking squarely in this tiny target. The problem, however, is that there are lots of other tiny targets on the wall. Once all those other targets are factored in, is it still unlikely that the archer could have hit any of them by chance?

In addition, we need to factor in what I call the replicational resources associated with &quot;T&quot;, that is, all the opportunities to bring about an event of &quot;T&quot;&#x27;s descriptive complexity and improbability by multiple agents witnessing multiple events.
According to Dembski, the number of such &quot;replicational resources&quot; can be bounded by &quot;the maximal number of bit operations that the known, observable universe could have performed throughout its entire multi-billion year history&quot;, which according to Lloyd is 10120.

However, according to Elsberry and Shallit, &quot;[specified complexity] has not been defined formally in any reputable peer-reviewed mathematical journal, nor (to the best of our knowledge) adopted by any researcher in information theory.&quot;

===Calculation of specified complexity===

Thus far, Dembski&#x27;s only attempt at calculating the specified complexity of a naturally occurring biological structure is in his book &quot;No Free Lunch&quot;, for the bacterial flagellum of E. coli. This structure can be described by the pattern &quot;bidirectional rotary motor-driven propeller&quot;. Dembski estimates that there are at most 1020 patterns described by four basic concepts or fewer, and so his test for design will apply if

:formula_3

However, Dembski says that the precise calculation of the relevant probability &quot;has yet to be done&quot;, although he also claims that some methods for calculating these probabilities &quot;are now in place&quot;.

These methods assume that all of the constituent parts of the flagellum must have been generated completely at random, a scenario that biologists do not seriously consider. He justifies this approach by appealing to Michael Behe&#x27;s concept of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; (IC), which leads him to assume that the flagellum could not come about by any gradual or step-wise process. The validity of Dembski&#x27;s particular calculation is thus wholly dependent on Behe&#x27;s IC concept, and therefore susceptible to its criticisms, of which there are many.

To arrive at the ranking upper bound of 1020 patterns, Dembski considers a specification pattern for the flagellum defined by the (natural language) predicate &quot;bidirectional rotary motor-driven propeller&quot;, which he regards as being determined by four independently chosen basic concepts. He furthermore assumes that English has the capability to express at most 105 basic concepts (an upper bound on the size of a dictionary). Dembski then claims that we can obtain the rough upper bound of

:formula_4
for the set of patterns described by four basic concepts or fewer.

From the standpoint of Kolmogorov complexity theory, this calculation is problematic. Quoting Ellsberry and Shallit &quot;Natural language specification without restriction, as Dembski tacitly permits, seems problematic. For one thing, it results in the Berry paradox&quot;. These authors add: &quot;We have no objection to natural language specifications per se, provided there is some evident way to translate them to Dembski&#x27;s formal framework. But what, precisely, is the space of events Ω here?&quot;

==Criticism==

The soundness of Dembski&#x27;s concept of specified complexity and the validity of arguments based on this concept are widely disputed. A frequent criticism (see Elsberry and Shallit) is that Dembski has used the terms &quot;complexity&quot;, &quot;information&quot; and &quot;improbability&quot; interchangeably. These numbers measure properties of things of different types: Complexity measures how hard it is to describe an object (such as a bitstring), information is how much the uncertainty about the state of an object is reduced by knowing the state of another object or system, and improbability measures how unlikely an event is given a probability distribution.

On page 150 of &quot;No Free Lunch&quot; Dembski claims he can demonstrate his thesis mathematically: &quot;In this section I will present an in-principle mathematical argument for why natural causes are incapable of generating complex specified information.&quot; When Tellgren investigated Dembski&#x27;s &quot;Law of Conservation of Information” using a more formal approach, he concluded it is mathematically unsubstantiated. Dembski responded in part that he is not &quot;in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the inability of material mechanisms to generate specified complexity&quot;. Jeffrey Shallit states that Demski&#x27;s mathematical argument has multiple problems, for example; a crucial calculation on page 297 of &quot;No Free Lunch&quot; is off by a factor of approximately 1065.

Dembski&#x27;s calculations show how a simple smooth function cannot gain information. He therefore concludes that there must be a designer to obtain CSI. However, natural selection has a branching mapping from one to many (replication) followed by pruning mapping of the many back down to a few (selection). When information is replicated, some copies can be differently modified while others remain the same, allowing information to increase. These increasing and reductional mappings were not modeled by Dembski. In other words, Dembski&#x27;s calculations do not model birth and death. This basic flaw in his modeling renders all of Dembski&#x27;s subsequent calculations and reasoning in &quot;No Free Lunch&quot; irrelevant because his basic model does not reflect reality. Since the basis of &quot;No Free Lunch&quot; relies on this flawed argument, the entire thesis of the book collapses.

According to Martin Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and evolutionary biology &quot;We cannot calculate the probability that an eye came about. We don&#x27;t have the information to make the calculation&quot;.

Dembski&#x27;s critics note that specified complexity, as originally defined by Leslie Orgel, is precisely what Darwinian evolution is supposed to create. Critics maintain that Dembski uses &quot;complex&quot; as most people would use &quot;absurdly improbable&quot;. They also claim that his argument is circular: CSI cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus. They argue that to successfully demonstrate the existence of CSI, it would be necessary to show that some biological feature undoubtedly has an extremely low probability of occurring by any natural means whatsoever, something which Dembski and others have almost never attempted to do. Such calculations depend on the accurate assessment of numerous contributing probabilities, the determination of which is often necessarily subjective. Hence, CSI can at most provide a &quot;very high probability&quot;, but not absolute certainty.

Another criticism refers to the problem of &quot;arbitrary but specific outcomes&quot;. For example, if a coin is tossed randomly 1000 times, the probability of any particular outcome occurring is roughly one in 10300. For any particular specific outcome of the coin-tossing process, the &quot;a priori&quot; probability (probability measured before event happens) that this pattern occurred is thus one in 10300, which is astronomically smaller than Dembski&#x27;s universal probability bound of one in 10150. Yet we know that the &quot;post hoc&quot; probability (probabilitly as observed after event occurs) of its happening is exactly one, since we observed it happening. This is similar to the observation that it is unlikely that any given person will win a lottery, but, eventually, a lottery will have a winner; to argue that it is very unlikely that any one player would win is not the same as proving that there is the same chance that no one will win. Similarly, it has been argued that &quot;a space of possibilities is merely being explored, and we, as pattern-seeking animals, are merely imposing patterns, and therefore targets, after the fact.&quot;

Apart from such theoretical considerations, critics cite reports of evidence of the kind of evolutionary &quot;spontanteous generation&quot; that Dembski claims is too improbable to occur naturally. For example, in 1982, B.G. Hall published research demonstrating that after removing a gene that allows sugar digestion in certain bacteria, those bacteria, when grown in media rich in sugar, rapidly evolve new sugar-digesting enzymes to replace those removed. Another widely cited example is the discovery of nylon eating bacteria that produce enzymes only useful for digesting synthetic materials that did not exist prior to the invention of nylon in 1935.

Other commentators have noted that evolution through selection is frequently used to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems which are considered problems too complex for human &quot;intelligent designers&quot;. This contradicts the argument that an intelligent designer is required for the most complex systems. Such evolutionary techniques can lead to designs that are difficult to understand or evaluate since no human understands which trade-offs were made in the evolutionary process, something which mimics our poor understanding of biological systems.

Dembski&#x27;s book &quot;No Free Lunch&quot; was criticised for not addressing the work of researchers who use computer simulations to investigate artificial life. According to Shallit:

The field of artificial life evidently poses a significant challenge to Dembski&#x27;s claims about the failure of evolutionary algorithms to generate complexity. Indeed, artificial life researchers regularly find their simulations of evolution producing the sorts of novelties and increased complexity that Dembski claims are impossible.

<text>John Jeremy Miles (14 June 1943 – 8 April 2018) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in 15 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, making his debut on 6 July 1969, in the Lotus 63 4-wheel drive F1 car for which he was the official Team Lotus test driver. He scored a total of 2 championship points with a fifth place in the 1970 South African Grand Prix.

==Early career==
In 1963/64, John Jeremy Miles (known as John &quot;Diva&quot; Miles and not to be confused with John &quot;Turner&quot; Miles) began his serious racing career and became the overall champion in the Redex Sports Car Championship driving a front engined Diva GT. A second season in the Diva this time supported by John Willment was also successful. He then went to win the 1966 Autosport Championship in the Willment sponsored Lotus Elan 26R with 15 outright wins from 17 races. This particular Elan 26R car was never beaten until the advent of the mid engined competitors such as the Chevron. At Boxing Day Brands 1966 he debuted the new Lotus 47GT and subsequently raced the works F3 Lotus 41 and long chassis 41X and GT 47 during 1967 and 1968 for the works team – winning four international F3 events in 1968.

==Formula One==

In 1969, Miles had to develop the Lotus 63 4WD car while World Champion Graham Hill and Jochen Rindt refused to drive this design, considering it a death trap. In five GPs, Miles finished only once, in 10th place. In between, the car was given twice to Mario Andretti, but he did not finish either. Miles did qualify mid-grid for the Canadian GP at Mosport, where the difficult combination of fast sweeping bends suited the 4-wheel-drive Lotus 63, which was a &#x27;disaster&#x27; on twisty tracks.

After Graham Hill had broken his legs in late 1969, he did not return to Team Lotus, driving Lotus cars for the Rob Walker Racing Team instead. Miles was promoted to number two Lotus F1 driver behind Jochen Rindt for the 1970 Formula One season. In the 1970 South African Grand Prix, where a total of five Lotus cars were entered, he finished fifth in a Lotus 49 with Hill behind him. Miles had driven most of the race with petrol leaking over him, but Colin Chapman expressed dissatisfaction he had not taken Beltoise for fourth. For the Spanish GP, the new Lotus 72 was entered, but Miles failed to qualify for the race in which Rindt had to retire early. Due to the problems with the 72, the updated Lotus 49C was used in Monaco, with Miles driving a few practice laps in the 72, and failing to qualify in the 49C. Graham Hill was slower in practice, but had a guaranteed grid place as a past World Champion, and was allocated Miles&#x27;s 49C for the race, which was won by Rindt. In Belgium, Miles raced the 72, while Rindt relied on the old 49C, and both had to retire. In Zandvoort, the 72 finally proved to be competitive, with Rindt qualifying on pole and winning, while Miles qualified and finished seventh in the race, driving a more experimental and difficult, version of the 72, which retained much of Chapman&#x27;s anti-squat and anti-dive roadholding features, and was a handful, if having excellent brakes. Miles made an excellent start, jumping into fifth and was running in the opening laps with eight of the greatest GP drivers nose to tail, held behind by good line, brakes and skilful blocking or the luck of a tyro in auto sport. Regazzoni got past when Miles missed a gear on lap 6 and Piers Courage passed Miles on lap 12. After that an intense midfield duel developed as Miles fought to hold off Jean-Pierre Beltoise and John Surtees. Rindt required real skill to lap the trio threading through on laps 30–33, ultimately just flagged past by his teammate. Beltoise was not able to get the Matra past the deep braking Miles&#x27;s 72 until the slippery lap 49, Surtees also got past on the lap, but was immediately retaken by the Miles 72 and Surtees did not finally secure the 6th place point, until he got past four laps from the flag with the 72&#x27;s brakes effectively gone. In France, Rindt won again in the 72 despite an injury, while Miles finished outside the points once again, although on the same lap as his team leader.

By now, it was evident that Miles was thoroughly overshadowed by his team leader who won five races to earn the F1 World Championship that year. According to Miles, Chapman regarded him &#x27;as a sort of grease monkey&#x27; and paid him a mere 300 pounds per race, out of which he had to pay his own travel expenses, occasionally supplemented by a roll of notes, on request, from Chapman&#x27;s back pocket to get Miles back to England.

For the British GP, Lotus cars founder and Team Lotus principal Chapman started to enter a third car with Emerson Fittipaldi. With the reliable 49C, the young Brazilian finished his first three GPs while Miles had to retire in both races, dogged by a hairline fracture in the water pipes, leading to retirement at quarter distance and slowing his progress during the race at Brands and Hockenheim, when finally running with a 72, close to Rindt&#x27;s 72 specifications, he would have been reasonably competitive. Miles qualified seventh at Brands Hatch, 1.2 seconds slower than Rindt on pole, who beat Brabham on the finishing line to win the British GP. Rindt scored a final victory at Hockenheim where Miles qualified tenth and diced with Surtees and Denny Hulme, until the Lotus 72&#x27;s Cosworth blew. With the three car team, Miles&#x27;s car did not get the same attention as Chapman obviously saw Fittipaldi as the future, as his old Lotus was seriously prepared and finished eighth and fourth in the British and German races, while the failure to discover, the fracture leaking water saw Miles retire at both races and had blown three Cosworth V8s during the practice sessions. During the Hockenheim practice sessions, Miles spent many laps providing a slipstream tow to enable Fittipaldi to qualify. Rindt said &quot;a monkey could have won in the car&quot; (the 72) and told Miles who qualified tenth, two seconds behind Rindt, that he was mystified than Miles didn&#x27;t drive faster, as two seconds slower was no safer in Rindt&#x27;s view. This may have been true in a Lotus 72 as Miles qualified on the fifth row again at the next race in Austria, a new, high speed lethal circuit. Miles found himself without braking on the fourth lap: &#x27;coming through the downhill before the final corner, my left front brake shaft broke&#x27;. Matters came to a head at the Italian GP, where Chapman ordered Miles to follow Rindt in running a new Lotus 72 without front and rear wings to take advantage of the Monza circuit&#x27;s long straights and fast, low-downforce corners. Miles reluctantly complied but was concerned by the wingless 72&#x27;s handling on the straights. His teammate Rindt was killed when one of the brake shafts on his new Type 72 failed and his car veered off the track, ploughing into the steel barrier which was placed too high for the revolutionary wedge design of the 72. Rindt, who had only recently acquiesced to wearing a simple lap belt, slid underneath and had his throat cut by the belt buckle. That was too much for Miles, who was widely regarded as too cerebral and sensitive to fit Chapman&#x27;s idea of a race driver, and he left the team. The team skipped the next race in Canada, and at Watkins Glen, Reine Wisell drove the second Lotus car, while Fittipaldi won, thereby securing both championships for Lotus.

Miles was signed for BRM for 1971, Lou and Jean Stanley recruiting him at the Dorchester, a precursor to the signing of Niki Lauda, (as seen in the doco/drama film, &#x27;Rush&#x27;) with Lou making a phone call to Bourne to receive the apparent reply that yet another 20 hp was being produced by the BRM V12 on the dyno. He was employed mainly as a test driver and raced in two non-championship rounds at Brands Hatch and Hockenheim in the BRM and also won the British sports car championship that year in 2-litre sports cars – in a Chevron B19 he beat a competitive field, including Chris Craft and Wilson Fittipaldi.

A qualified mechanical engineer, Miles later made a name for himself working for Lotus&#x27;s road car division. He wrote a column, &quot;Miles Behind The Wheel&quot;, for &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine, giving his road impressions of sportier cars.

==Personal life==
Miles was the son of the actors Bernard Miles and Josephine Wilson.

Miles died on 8 April 2018, due to complications following a stroke.

==Miles Music==
In 1985 Miles founded &#x27;Miles Music&#x27;, a jazz recording company, with Peter Watts. In 1996, their release of the CD &quot;Tamburello&quot; by Peter King won the BT Jazz CD of the year award. It was inspired by the death of Ayrton Senna.

<doc id="1271028" wikidata="Q1117515" url="?curid=1271028" title="John Miles (musician)">
<text>John Miles (born John Errington; 23 April 1949 – 5 December 2021) was an English rock singer, guitarist and keyboard player best known for his 1976 top 3 UK hit single &quot;Music&quot;, which won an Ivor Novello Award, and his frequent appearances at Night of the Proms. He won the &quot;Outstanding Musical Achievement&quot; award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. He released 10 albums from 1976 to 1999 and was also a touring musician for Tina Turner from 1987 to 2009.

==Early life==
Miles was born John Errington in Jarrow, County Durham, to Alec and Doris, attending St. Peters School before passing his eleven-plus exam and joining Jarrow Grammar School. While still a pupil at Jarrow Grammar School, Miles started guitar lessons in nearby Hebburn and was encouraged by his grammar school music teacher, Jimmy Joseph, to take up a career in music, but his first job after leaving school was making lavatory signs. Miles played in several local bands, including the John Miles Set 
,Derringers, the New Atlantians and the Urge before joining the Influence, which also included Paul Thompson, later the drummer with Roxy Music, and Vic Malcolm, later lead guitarist with Geordie. This outfit released the single &quot;I Want to Live&quot; (Orange Records, 1969). Following this, he formed the John Miles Set, with Bob Marshall and Dave Symonds before starting his solo career in 1971. 

In 1972 &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported on a new distribution agreement between Orange Records and the larger Pye Records label; &quot;Orange, the label offshoot of the Orange recording studios, will release John Miles&#x27; &quot;Come Away MeLinda&quot;[&quot;sic&quot;] as its first record through Pye.&quot; 

Other releases included those written by Australian writing duo Vanda &amp; Young: &quot;The World Belongs to Yesterday&quot; (1972), &quot;Yesterday Was Just the Beginning of My Life&quot; (1972) and &quot;One Minute Every Hour&quot; (1973). It was while on a break on a Saturday stint at Peter Stringfellow&#x27;s Leeds club that he first started writing what became &quot;Music&quot;. In 1972, the band appeared on the television series &quot;Opportunity Knocks.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Success ===
Miles signed a recording contract with the Decca UK label in 1975 and issued four albums; &quot;Rebel&quot; (1976) - No. 9 on the UK chart, &quot;Stranger in the City&quot; (1977) - No. 37 UK, &quot;Zaragon&quot; (1978) - No. 43 UK and &quot;More Miles Per Hour&quot; (1979) - No. 46 UK. Miles had the most success with singles and released a total of eighteen during this era, with four reaching the UK top 40. In addition to &quot;Music&quot;, he also charted in the UK with &quot;Highfly&quot; (1975) - No. 17, &quot;Remember Yesterday&quot; (1976) - No. 32, and &quot;Slow Down&quot; (1977) - No. 10. In 1975, the readers of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; voted Miles as Best Newcomer. Not long after &quot;Music&quot;&#x27;s release, Miles was described by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;the brightest, freshest force in British rock&quot;.

&quot;Music&quot; won Miles an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Best Middle of the Road Song&quot; in 1977. Most of his songs were co-written with the bassist in his backing group, Bob Marshall.

At the peak of his success, in 1976 and 1977, Miles made several appearances on the weekly pop TV shows &quot;Supersonic&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The debut album did receive some attention in the US. Two singles from the debut album reached the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, &quot;Highfly&quot; peaked at No. 68, followed by &quot;Music&quot; which stalled at No. 88. In Canada, &quot;Highfly&quot; reached No. 74, and &quot;Slow Down&quot; reached No. 68. However, &quot;Music&quot; reached No. 1 on the Dutch and Belgian charts and No. 4 on the Swiss charts. &quot;Slow Down&quot; was his biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the disco chart, and at No. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1977. It was later featured in the 1979 film &quot;Players&quot;, starring Ali MacGraw and Dean Paul Martin. The album &quot;Zaragon&quot; reached No. 3 on the Swedish and Portuguese charts. On his US tour to promote &quot;Zaragon&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that &quot;Miles boast several strengths: solid vocals, sharp guitar play and strong material&quot;.

Miles opened for Elton John on his 1976 Louder Than Concorde (But Not Quite As Pretty) Tour of North America. Miles and his band also open for other top artists during this period, including Fleetwood Mac, Aerosmith, Jethro Tull and the Rolling Stones. In 1978, Miles was invited to appear on the BBC &quot;Sight and Sound in Concert&quot; programme which aired simultaneously on BBC Radio 1 and BBC 2 on 11 March 1978.

=== Later career ===
The early success of &quot;Rebel&quot; tailed off so much that Ian Gilbey in &quot;Electronics &amp; Music Maker&quot; wrote:

From 1985, Miles participated almost every year in the Night of the Proms, a series of concerts held yearly in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Denmark and the United States. Regularly there were also shows in Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. The concerts consist of a combination of pop music and popular classical music (often combined) and various well-known musicians and groups usually participate.

Miles always performed &quot;Music&quot;, regarded as the anthem of the show, and also sang other songs with other artists. In 2009, the album &quot;The Best of John Miles at the Night of the Proms&quot; was released, which included &quot;Music&quot; and cover versions including &quot;All by Myself&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot;.

Miles&#x27; 1986 album &quot;Transition&quot; was praised by &quot;Billboard&quot;, which said that &quot;gutsy playing and even strength of material should assure wide exposure&quot;.

Miles also toured with Tina Turner from 1987, playing keyboards, guitar and supporting vocals on every one of her tours, and played on several of her albums. He also appeared on Jimmy Page&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Outrider&quot; and subsequent tour (his wide-ranging vocals allowed him to cover both Robert Plant and Paul Rodgers from Page&#x27;s two previous bands), and played Hammond organ on Joe Cocker&#x27;s album &quot;Night Calls&quot; (1992), with whom he toured for two years. In 1990, Miles participated in the UK heat of &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; with the song &quot;Where I Belong&quot;, which came second.

Miles was also a frequent guest vocalist on albums by the Alan Parsons Project, being featured on &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; (1976), &quot;Pyramid&quot; (1978), &quot;Stereotomy&quot; (1985), and &quot;Gaudi&quot; (1987), as well as on the Eric Woolfson album &quot;Freudiana&quot; (1990). He appeared on Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Romanza&quot; on the tracks &quot;Funiculi Funicula&quot; and &quot;Miserere&quot;.

His first DVD, &quot;John Miles – Live in Concert&quot; was released in 2002. In 2007, Miles performed in Gelsenkirchen, Germany with German band Pur and sang two songs. On one of those songs, &quot;Abenteuerland&quot;, Miles sang with Pur in German. The concert is available on the DVD, &quot;Pur&amp;Friends-Live-auf-Schalke-2007&quot;. In October 2008, Miles began touring once again with Tina Turner until May 2009.

The Olympiapark in Munich gave Miles a symbolic key to the park in 2015 as the performer who had opened the door the most times, and the moment was recorded on the Munich Olympic Walk of Stars.

In 2017, Miles was awarded an outstanding contribution to music award at the Progressive Rock awards.

In 2019, Miles starred in a flashmob performance of &quot;Music&quot; organized by Südwestrundfunk (SWR; Southwest Broadcasting), a regional public broadcasting corporation serving the southwest of Germany. It was held in the marketplace of Landau and involved more than 100 people including the members of the State Youth Orchestra of Rhineland Palatinate and 20 camera operators.

In 2020, Miles recorded a new version of &quot;Music&quot; remotely with the Antwerp Philharmonic &#x27;Quarantine&#x27; Orchestra due to the cancellation of the Night of the Proms due to Covid.

===Musicals===
In 1998, Miles entered the world of stage musicals by creating the score for the adaption of Robert Westall&#x27;s &quot;The Machine Gunners&quot; by Tom Kelly and Ken Reay. This was followed in 1999 with further collaboration with Tom Kelly on &quot;Tom and Catherine&quot;, the life story of the romantic writer Catherine Cookson and her husband Tom. Their next work was &quot;Dan Dare The Musical&quot; in 2003, with Miles writing the score for &quot;Cuddy&#x27;s Miles&quot; by Arthur McKenzie and David Whitaker, which was about the Jarrow Marches with the character Cuddy being Miles grandfather Cuthbert. In 2016, Miles and Kelly collaborated on &quot;Dolly Mixtures&quot;, a musical based on the story of eight women who set-up a variety act when one of their husbands was diagnosed with cancer – later going on to raise £100,000 in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Personal life and death ==
Miles died after a short illness on 5 December 2021 at the age of 72 and was survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Eileen, two children and two grandchildren. His son, John Miles Jr., is also a musician and played with groups such as Milk Inc., Sylver, the Urge and Fixate.

Alan Parsons wrote of Miles:

<doc id="1271038" wikidata="Q10188" url="?curid=1271038" title="Zuni language">
<text>Zuni (also formerly Zuñi, endonym ) is a language of the Zuni people, indigenous to western New Mexico and eastern Arizona in the United States. It is spoken by around 9,500 people, especially in the vicinity of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, and much smaller numbers in parts of Arizona.

Unlike most indigenous languages in the United States, Zuni is still spoken by a significant number of children and, thus, is comparatively less threatened with language endangerment. Edmund Ladd reported in 1994 that Zuni is still the main language of communication in the pueblo and is used in the home (Newman 1996).

The Zuni name for their own language, &quot;&quot; (&quot;shiwi&quot; &quot;Zuni&quot; + &quot;-ʼma&quot; &quot;vernacular&quot;; pronounced ) can be translated as &quot;Zuni way&quot;, whereas its speakers are collectively known as &quot;ʼA:shiwi&quot; (&quot;ʼa:(w)-&quot; &quot;plural&quot; + &quot;shiwi&quot; &quot;Zuni&quot;).

==Classification==
Zuni is considered a language isolate. The Zuni have, however, borrowed a number of words from Keres, Hopi, and O’odham pertaining to religion and religious observances.

A number of possible relationships of Zuni to other languages have been proposed by various researchers, although none of these have gained general acceptance. The main hypothetical proposals have been connections with Penutian (and Penutioid and Macro-Penutian), Tanoan, and Hokan phyla, and also the Keresan languages.

The most clearly articulated hypothesis is Newman&#x27;s (1964) connection to Penutian, but even this was considered by Newman (according to Michael Silverstein) to be a tongue-in-cheek work due to the inherently problematic nature of the methodology used in Penutian studies (Goddard 1996). Newman&#x27;s cognate sets suffered from common problems in comparative linguistics, such as comparing commonly borrowed forms (e.g. &quot;tobacco&quot;), forms with large semantic differences (e.g. &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;garbage&quot;, &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;hoof&quot;), nursery forms, and onomatopoetic forms (Campbell 1997). Zuni was also included under Morris Swadesh&#x27;s Penutioid proposal and Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s very inclusive Penutian sub-grouping – both without convincing arguments (Campbell 1997).

Zuni was included as being part of the Aztec-Tanoan language family within Edward Sapir&#x27;s heuristic 1929 classification (without supporting evidence). Later discussions of the Aztec-Tanoan hypothesis usually excluded Zuni (Foster 1996).

Karl-Heinz Gursky published problematic unconvincing evidence for a Keresan-Zuni grouping. J. P. Harrington wrote one unpublished paper with the title &quot;Zuñi Discovered to be Hokan&quot; (Campbell 1997).

==Language contact==

As Zuni is a language in the Pueblo linguistic area, it shares a number of features with Hopi, Keresan, and Tanoan (and to a lesser extent Navajo) that are probably due to language contact. The development of ejective consonants in Zuni may be due to contact with Keresan and Tanoan languages which have complete series of ejectives. Likewise, aspirated consonants may have diffused into Zuni. Other shared traits include: final devoicing of vowels and sonorant consonants, dual number, ceremonial vocabulary, and the presence of a labialized velar (Campbell 1997).

==Phonology==
The 16 consonants of Zuni (with IPA phonetic symbol when different from the orthography) are the following:

The vowels are the following:

Zuni syllables have the following specification:

: C(C)V(ː)(C)(C)

==Morphology==
Word order in Zuni is fairly free with a tendency toward SOV. There is no case-marking on nouns. Verbs are complex, compared to nouns, with loose incorporation. Like other languages in the Southwest, Zuni employs switch-reference.

Newman (1965, 1996) classifies Zuni words according to their structural morphological properties (namely the presence and type of inflectional suffixes), not according to their associated syntactic frames. His terms, &quot;noun&quot; and &quot;substantive&quot;, are therefore not synonymous.

=== Pronouns ===
Zuni uses overt pronouns for first and second persons. There are no third person pronouns. The pronouns distinguish three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and three cases (subject, object and possessive). In addition, some subject and possessive pronouns have different forms depending on whether they appear utterance-medially or utterance-finally (object pronouns do not occur utterance-medially). All pronoun forms are shown in the following table:

There is syncretism between dual and plural non-possessive forms in the first and second persons. Utterances with these pronouns are typically disambiguated by the fact that plural pronouns agree with plural-marked verb forms.

==Sociolinguistics==
* storytelling (&quot;Delapna:we&quot;) – Tedlock (1972)
* ceremonial speech – Newman (1955)
* slang – Newman (1955)

===Names===
Zuni adults are often known after the relationship between that adult and a child. For example, a person might be called &quot;father of so-and-so&quot;, etc. The circumlocution is used to avoid using adult names, which have religious meanings and are very personal.

==Orthography==
There are twenty letters in the Zuni alphabet.
* Double consonants indicate geminate (long) sounds, for instance the in &quot;car&quot;, is pronounced .
* Long vowels are indicated with a colon following the vowel as the in &quot;animals&quot;.
* is not part of the alphabet, although the digraph is. There are also other two-letter combination sounds (like ).
* are not used to write Zuni, except for the occasional borrowed word.
* indicates IPA (a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative, pronounced roughly like &quot;h&quot; and &quot;l&quot; together).
* indicates IPA (a glottal stop) – it is written medially and finally but not word-initially.

This orthography was largely worked out by Curtis Cook.

===Old orthographies===
Linguists and anthropologists have created and used their own writing system for Zuni before the alphabet was standardized. One was developed for Zuni by linguist Stanley Newman (Newman 1954). This practical orthography essentially followed Americanist phonetic notation with the substitution of some uncommon letters with other letters or digraphs (two-letter combinations). A further revised orthography is used in Dennis Tedlock&#x27;s transcriptions of oral narratives.

See the table below for a comparison of the systems.




In Newman&#x27;s orthography (used in his dictionary, Newman 1958), the symbols, replaced Americanist (used in Newman&#x27;s grammar, Newman 1965).

Tedlock&#x27;s orthography uses instead of Newman&#x27;s except at the beginning of words where it is not written. Additionally, in Tedlock&#x27;s system, long vowels are written doubled instead of with a length mark as in Newman&#x27;s system (e.g. instead of ) and and are used instead of and . Finally, Tedlock writes the following long consonants – – with a doubled initial letter instead of Newman&#x27;s doubling of the digraphs – , , – and and are used instead of Newman&#x27;s and .

<doc id="1271039" wikidata="Q5431859" url="?curid=1271039" title="Falernum">
<text>Falernum ( ) is either a syrup liqueur or a nonalcoholic syrup from the Caribbean. It is best known for its use in tropical drinks. It contains flavors of ginger, lime, and almond, and frequently cloves or allspice. It may be thought of as a spicier version of orgeat syrup.

The form can be alcoholic (syrup liqueur) or nonalcoholic (syrup). Versions with alcohol are generally lower in proof (≈15% ABV), adding rum and emphasizing the clove, ginger, or allspice flavoring aspects for use in mixing cocktails, typically tropical or tiki drinks. It is also enjoyed on the rocks.

Depending on sugar content, the consistency is often thick and is therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;velvet falernum&quot; because of the feeling it leaves on one&#x27;s tongue. Brands vary. The color can be white to light amber, and it may be clear or translucent.

==History==
Falernum may date back to the 18th century, when it was made as a punch in the areas around Barbados. Some disagreement exists over the origin of the name, and whether the earliest versions would have included the steeping of almonds.
 The same references also assert that earlier versions contained bitters such as wormwood. The inclusion of bitters historically would seem to be corroborated by a 1982 article appearing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In the literary magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, owned by Charles Dickens Jr. at the time, an unnamed author wrote of falernum in 1892, describing it as &quot;a curious liqueur composed from rum and lime-juice&quot;.

The earliest known reference in bar manuals seems to be the 1930s. One producer claims his recipe dates to 1890, winning awards as early as 1923.

==Use in cocktails==
Drinks using falernum include:

*Better and Better
*Captain&#x27;s Blood Cocktail
*Corn &#x27;n Oil (Barbados)
*Frosty Dawn
*Key Cocktail
*Mai Tai (not Trader Vic&#x27;s)
*Port Antonio Cocktail
*Puka Punch
*Royal Bermuda Cocktail
*Rum Collins (some variations)
*Bermuda Rum Swizzle

<text>The Battle of Ấp Bắc was a major battle fought on 2 January 1963 during the Vietnam War in Định Tường Province (now part of Tiền Giang Province), South Vietnam. On 28 December 1962, US intelligence detected the presence of a radio transmitter along with a sizable force of Viet Cong (VC) soldiers, reported to number around 120, in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province, home of the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam (ARVN) 7th Infantry Division. The South Vietnamese and their US advisers planned to attack Ap Tan Thoi from three directions to destroy the VC force by using two provincial Civil Guard battalions and elements of the 11th Infantry Regiment, ARVN 7th Infantry Division. The infantry units would be supported by artillery, M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs), and helicopters. However, Viet Cong forces anticipated a major attack from the South Vietnamese government from a variety of sources including movement of supplies, an undercover VC agent, and decoded radio communications from the ARVN. Accordingly, the VC prepared for an attack by US and South Vietnamese forces.

On the morning of 2 January 1963, the South Vietnamese Civil Guards spearheaded the attack by marching toward Ap Tan Thoi from the south. However, when they reached the hamlet of Ap Bac, southeast of Ap Tan Thoi, they were immediately pinned down by elements of the VC 261st Battalion. Shortly afterward, three companies of the 11th Infantry Regiment were committed into battle in northern Ap Tan Thoi. However, they too could not overcome the VC soldiers who had entrenched themselves in the area. Just before midday, further reinforcements were flown in from Tan Hiep. The 15 US helicopters ferrying the troops were riddled by VC gunfire and five helicopters were lost as a result.

The ARVN 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron was then deployed to rescue the South Vietnamese soldiers and US aircrews trapped at the southwest end of Ap Bac. However, its commander was highly reluctant to move heavy M113 APCs across the local terrain. Ultimately, their presence made little difference as the VC stood its ground and killed more than a dozen South Vietnamese M113 crew members in the process. The ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion was dropped late in the afternoon onto the battlefield. In a scene that characterized much of the day&#x27;s fighting, they were pinned down and could not break the VC&#x27;s line of defense. Under cover of darkness, the VC withdrew from the battlefield, winning their first major victory.

==Background==
Small-scale military actions, which would eventually escalate into the Vietnam War, started in the late 1950s, when South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem instituted an anti-Communist campaign aimed at rooting out &quot;left behind&quot; Viet Minh forces. At that time, North Vietnam was hoping for an election, promised under the Geneva Accords of 1954, that would unite North and South Vietnam. It was also worried about inciting the United States into directly supporting South Vietnam and had recommended avoiding battle at all costs. However, Diem&#x27;s campaign was too successful to allow them to do nothing, and small-scale actions broke out across the country. North Vietnam remained worried about US involvement and refused military support, forcing the remaining Viet Minh to retreat into inaccessible areas in the forests and mountains. A stalemate of sorts followed as South Vietnamese forces took so long to reach these areas that the guerrilla fighters were able to retreat with little difficulty.

Large-scale American support began during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s, with the arrival of large numbers of the US Special Forces to help out in the field. The arrival of helicopters changed the nature of the battle considerably. Helicopters enabled South Vietnamese soldiers to quickly fly to almost any point in the country, leaving little time for a retreat. Throughout 1962, the combined forces were increasingly effective in routing the VC. These tactics, combined with armored personnel carriers, took a heavy toll on various fledgling VC units. The lightly armed VC had no weaponry capable of stopping the armored carriers and inevitably were forced to flee, taking heavy casualties.

The most successful South Vietnamese force had been the 7th Infantry Division, then under the command of Colonel Huỳnh Văn Cao. His US adviser was Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann, who directed much of the unit&#x27;s activity in concert with his planner, Captain Richard Ziegler. They had scored the biggest successes of the military campaigns of 1962, killing along with the paramilitary and Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps, more than 2,000 VC fighters, and leaving thousands of others cut off from supplies.

However, South Vietnamese officers were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao&#x27;s forces were in an excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of VC. However, he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified Vann, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the joint planning sessions that had been so successful earlier, and action essentially wound down in their region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of VC, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not exist.

In 1962, Diem decided to split the command of the area in the south around Saigon into two, the former III Corps area being reduced in size to cover the area northeast of Saigon, and the newly created IV Corps taking over the west and southwest. Cao was promoted to general and assumed command of the new IV Corps Tactical Zone, which included the area of operations of his 7th Infantry Division. Command of the 7th was given to Cao&#x27;s chief of staff, Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm. Dam expressed concerns about his own abilities when the promotion was first presented to him by Diem. Nevertheless, he took Cao&#x27;s former position and welcomed Vann&#x27;s advisers back into the planning effort. Despite the change in leadership, the same problems continued to plague the 7th Infantry Division.

==Prelude==
In November 1962, the VC&#x27;s Military Region 2 ordered the VC 261st Battalion and the 514th Battalion, the home battalion of Dinh Tuong Province, to destroy the strategic hamlets in their region and at the same time to attack South Vietnamese sweeping operations. Between 28 and 30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a VC radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province, where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann&#x27;s intelligence officer, indicated that the VC used Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed the VC had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Confident that the VC unit was no larger than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.

An operations plan suited for an attack on a small enemy formation was drafted by Ziegler, an adviser to Dam and the command staff of the 7th Infantry Division. Ziegler&#x27;s plan, codenamed Operation &quot;Duc Thang I&quot;, called for the South Vietnamese to assault Ap Tan Thoi from three different directions: three rifle companies from the 11th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, to move from the north; the Dinh Tuong Civil Guards Regiment to march north from the south in separate columns; and a company of 13 M113 armored personnel carriers with an infantry company on board from the southwest. The M113 carriers and the infantry company could act as both a mobile reserve and a reaction force, so it was positioned where it could be shifted to the contact area if the VC began to retreat. In addition, Dam would also deploy two rifle companies at Tan Hiep airfield (), which could be brought to the battlefield by helicopters from the US Army 93rd Transportation Company.

On previous occasions, US intelligence had tracked down the location of Viet Cong radio transmitters. However, those were often relocated before the South Vietnamese launched their attacks, so Ziegler privately questioned if the VC had as many as 120 soldiers in Ap Tan Thoi. However, in 1963, the VC had changed its policy from avoiding the ARVN to standing and fighting. The 1st Company, 261st Battalion, and the 1st Company, 514th Battalion, had a total strength of 320 regular soldiers and were positioned in Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi, respectively, which were separated by a distance of about . The combined companies were supported by approximately 30 local force soldiers from Chau Thanh District who served as scouts, ammunition bearers, litter-bearers, and emergency replacements. Together, elements of the VC 261st and 514th Battalions in Ap Tan Thoi and Ap Bac formed a &quot;composite battalion&quot;, which was placed under the command of Colonel Hai Hoang.

Previously, the leadership of the 261st Battalion alternated between Hoang, a South Vietnamese revolutionary who had returned from North Vietnam after 1954, and Tu Khue, a native of North Vietnam. Khue was unpopular among the battalion&#x27;s soldiers because he was very strict and demanding. However, he was meticulous about details. In contrast, Hoang was far more relaxed and commanded a high degree of confidence from the soldiers of the 261st Battalion. Thus, due to his strong leadership skills and popularity, Hoang was selected to take command of VC forces for operations in Ap Bac. Most of the soldiers under Hoang&#x27;s command were equipped with captured US weaponry, such as M1 Garands, M1 carbines, BAR light machine guns, .30 caliber machine guns, and a single 60mm mortar.

In the days before the battle, Hoang anticipated a major attack from the South Vietnamese government, as VC intelligence agents in Dinh Tuong had reported the arrival of 71 truckloads of ammunition and other supplies from Saigon, about to the northeast. In addition, with the information provided by Pham Xuan An, a well-connected journalist and undercover VC agent in Saigon, Hoang&#x27;s soldiers conducted last-minute anti-helicopter and anti-M113 training by studying US weaponry and South Vietnamese plans and manuals. Furthermore, using radios captured from the ARVN, the VC was able to intercept news of the attack due to unencoded radio communications from the ARVN. The VC also took full advantage of the local terrain by taking up positions in Ap Tan Thoi in the north, along a tree-lined creek in the southeast, and Ap Bac in the south. Their positions were well-concealed by trees and shrubs, making them difficult to see from the air and providing good protection from heavy weaponry. To the south and west of Ap Bac, the VC dug a series of foxholes in front of an irrigation dike, which afforded them an unobstructed field of fire in the surrounding rice fields. The foxholes were deep enough for one man to stand up or big enough to accommodate a two-person machine gun crew. Behind the foxhole line, the irrigation dike enabled VC units to communicate with each other. In short, the VC enjoyed a great advantage over any attacking force.

==Battle==
===The fight begins===
At 04:00 on the morning of 2 January, VC scouts around the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi reported hearing the sounds of truck and boat engines, so Hoang issued an alert order which prompted his troops to pick up their weapons and hurry to their foxholes. Most of the women, children, and older men in both hamlets fled and hid in the nearby swamps as soon as the order was issued.

Thirty CH-21 Shawnee helicopters were needed to airlift the entire ARVN 1st Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment, but only ten were available. As a result, Dam could only send one company at a time onto the battlefield. At around 07:00, the first wave of CH-21 helicopters offloaded the first South Vietnamese soldiers. These troops had to hold their positions until the rest of the battalions had arrived. Because of the delay in the arrival of the regular South Vietnamese army units, two Civil Guard battalions of Task Forces A and B—under the command of Dinh Tuong provincial chief Major Lam Quang Tho—were left to march against enemy positions by themselves.

As planned, the first Civil Guard battalion of Task Force A started north towards Ap Bac. Hoang knew the Civil Guard battalions were approaching, so he instructed his company commander in Ap Bac to be ready, as they would fire the first shots of the battle. VC radio operators, using captured US communications equipment, followed the movements of the Civil Guards by monitoring the frequencies the government troops were using. When the leading Civil Guard battalion came within of the south end of Ap Bac, the VC opened fire from their foxholes and immediately killed the leading company&#x27;s commander and wounded the task force commander. Task Force A&#x27;s momentum was stopped when the soldiers of the leading Civil Guard battalion sought shelter in a dike, where they tried unsuccessfully to outflank the VC. During that time, artillery support was ineffective, as Civil Guard forward observers would not stand up to observe the fall of artillery rounds. Consequently, one artillery round after another fell behind VC positions instead of on their foxholes. To make matters worse, Tho failed to send his second Civil Guard battalion of Task Force B to rescue the first.

North of Ap Tan Thoi, three ARVN 11th Infantry Regiment companies fared no better. They marched south in three separate axes towards their objective. Again, well-concealed VC soldiers of the 514th Battalion allowed their opponents to come within before opening fire. Immediately, the South Vietnamese infantrymen were forced to hug the ground. During the next five hours, they managed to launch three major assaults but failed to break the VC&#x27;s line of defense. By 09:30, the last of Dam&#x27;s reserve companies had been airlifted into Tan Hiep, about two hours late because American aircrews were prevented from landing their CH-21 helicopters, known as &quot;flying bananas&quot; for their shape, in the heavy fog that covered Tan Hiep Airfield most of the morning. With the ground attacks in the north and south bogged down, Dam decided to stretch out the defending VC units by attacking the east and the west.

Dam asked Vann, who was circling the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones on the east and west sides of Ap Bac where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any VC positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position at the south end of the hamlet, due to the impact of the VC&#x27;s firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle&#x27;s inception. As Vann&#x27;s L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the VC watched from their foxholes but held their fire because they knew the aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.

Vann then ordered his pilot to make contact with the other L-19 that was leading the ten CH-21s with the first South Vietnamese reserve company from Tan Hiep. Vann relayed a message to the command pilot of the ten CH-21 helicopters, which were being escorted by a group of five recently deployed UH-1 Huey gunships, armed with 7.62mm machine guns and 2.75-inch rockets and instructed him to land the reserve companies about from the western and southern tree lines that covered Ap Bac in order to minimize the effectiveness of the VC&#x27;s .30 caliber machine guns. However, in the early phases of the war, command relationships between US military units were not well-established, and American aircrews tended to disregard the instructions of advisors, especially Vann, who was regarded as domineering. Instead of following Vann&#x27;s instructions, the command pilot led his helicopters over southern Ap Tan Thoi and along the creek to Ap Bac. The US pilots landed their helicopters west of Ap Bac, where they were hit multiple times by VC machine gun and small arms fire.

The five UH-1 gunships strafed VC positions with 2.75-inch rockets but failed to suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged to get off the ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized as soon as it touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. The main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire as it prepared to land. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.

===Arrival of the armored personnel carriers===
After Bowers had attended to the injured men, he borrowed a field radio from the South Vietnamese to coordinate artillery and airstrikes. Later, two AD-6 Skyraiders arrived over Ap Bac and attacked the thatched houses with conventional bombs and napalm. The South Vietnamese soldiers, pinned down on the ground, believed their ordeal was over, so they stood up to see if the VC were retreating from their positions. The VC fired on the exposed soldiers and killed several. Vann then radioed Captain James B. Scanlon—senior adviser to the ARVN 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment—and told him that four US helicopters had either been destroyed or immobilized about southeast of the regiment&#x27;s position. Scanlon was told to get his South Vietnamese counterpart, Captain Ly Tong Ba—commander of the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, to rescue the trapped South Vietnamese company and the helicopters.
Ba asserted that he would not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the VC to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterward, Ziegler returned with Dam&#x27;s permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers toward the white smoke rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba&#x27;s M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, VC fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, VC commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.
The South Vietnamese M113s had no problem crossing the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied that he would not take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched VC.

Meanwhile, a fourth CH-21 returned to Ap Bac to rescue the downed helicopter crews. It was also heavily damaged by ground fire and forced to land on the muddy rice field. The VC had set a new record: the battle was the first time they had either destroyed or downed five helicopters within a few hours. At 13:30, Ba&#x27;s M113 formation finally closed in on the downed helicopters on the west side of Ap Bac. The M113s approached the landing zone in a single file instead of in formation. They were immediately fired upon by VC inside the hamlet, who could concentrate their fire on one target at a time. The South Vietnamese M113 gun crews were exposed from the waist up, so they were easy targets for snipers; by the end of the day, 14 South Vietnamese M113 crewmen had been killed due to their exposure. The two leading M113s were able to pull up beside the downed helicopters, but one driver was killed while driving with his head outside the hatch, and Ba was knocked unconscious inside his carrier.

Scanlon, with the help of Bowers, ran forward to aid the wounded men and carry them back to the M113 formation. At that point, South Vietnamese M113 crews backed off while firing their .50 caliber machine guns aimlessly into the sky. When Ba recovered, his company launched a frontal assault on the VC&#x27;s foxhole line. Just when the M113 crews closed in on their objective, a VC squad leader and his men jumped out of their foxholes and tossed grenades at the lead formation of the attack force. Cohesion and morale among the crews of the armored formation quickly deteriorated as South Vietnamese sergeants, who served as both commanders and machine gunners of the carriers, were killed and were replaced by less experienced, poorly trained men.

In a last-ditch effort to overrun the VC&#x27;s stronghold, an M113 equipped with a flamethrower was sent forward to within of the VC position to fire the western tree line. The flamethrower had a range of up to , but when the operator fired the device, the flame died after only . It was later discovered that the crew had mixed the incorrect amount of jelling agent with the gasoline. The final attack mounted by the M113 company failed. At around 14:30, defeated and with their morale sagging, the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron disengaged from the fight and withdrew.

By that stage, Vann was frustrated by the Civil Guard soldiers of Task Force B because they appeared to be in no hurry to reach Ap Bac, as they searched one house at a time while marching up from the southwest flank of the battlefield. In his final effort to defeat the VC, Vann flew into Tan Hiep and asked Cao to deploy an airborne battalion on the east side of Ap Bac, the most logical retreat route for the Viet Cong. Vann hoped to trap the Viet Cong inside the hamlets by blocking their retreat routes on all sides and annihilating them using an elite battalion of South Vietnamese paratroopers. To Vann&#x27;s disappointment, Cao strongly opposed the idea and decided to drop one of his airborne battalions behind the M113 formation on the west side instead. Vann accused Cao of wanting to let the VC escape in order to avoid further South Vietnamese casualties. However, Cao argued that a surrounded and well-entrenched enemy would fight more fiercely than a retreating one, so he wanted the VC units inside the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi to expose themselves by retreating through the eastern side of the battlefield, where he could destroy them with artillery and air power. Cao had also lost confidence in Vann, because Cao felt Vann had placed the lives of many South Vietnamese soldiers at risk to save the lives of a handful of Americans. Major-General Tran Thien Khiem, Chief of the ARVN Joint General Staff, was present during the argument. He did not object to Cao&#x27;s plan because it was consistent with President Diem&#x27;s objective to save Vietnamese lives through the Rural Revolutionary Development and Chieu Hoi Programs, which encouraged VC fighters to join the South Vietnamese military.

===Insertion of the airborne battalion===
Believing it was useless to continue arguing with Cao, Vann climbed back into his L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and left Tan Hiep. Throughout the afternoon, he continued to press Cao to deploy the South Vietnamese paratroopers quickly. He was fearful that the battle would be the most significant defeat of South Vietnamese forces up to that point of the war. Cao promised to deploy the second Civil Guard battalion, which had just arrived at the southwest flank of Ap Bac, and to drop the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion at around 16:00 behind Ba&#x27;s armored personnel carriers. Late in the afternoon, a flight of C-123 Providers, with about 300 South Vietnamese paratroopers aboard, closed in on their objective and quickly drew machine gun fire from the hamlet. The C-123 pilots changed course to avoid the ground fire. However, either the South Vietnamese jumpmaster or the American flight leader did not compensate for the change. As a result, the paratroopers landed right in front of the entrenched VC positions, instead of behind the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron and the Civil Guards.

The VC were able to pick off one South Vietnamese paratrooper after another, some as they descended and others when their parachutes became stuck in the trees. Those paratroopers who reached the ground and survived tried to move forward, but the VC soldiers in defilade position fired on the paratroopers exposed in the open rice paddies. Undeterred, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion launched small-unit attacks, but on each occasion, they were repelled, and sporadic fighting continued until sundown. By the end of the day, the airborne battalion had lost 19 soldiers killed in action and another 33 wounded. American advisers Captain Fletcher Ware and Sergeant Russell Kopti, who had parachuted in with the South Vietnamese, were wounded. As night fell, Hoang knew that South Vietnamese forces were closing in from three directions. The eastern flank remained open, and he ordered both elements of the 261st and 514th Battalions, exhausted and low on ammunition, to assemble at the south end of Ap Tan Thoi. They evacuated through the rice fields, taking their dead and wounded comrades.

Vann wanted to use a C-47 flare plane to illuminate the rice fields on the eastern flank of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. He wanted to hit the VC with 500 rounds of artillery and destroy them as they retreated. Cao would not approve the use of flares because it could expose the airborne battalion&#x27;s night defensive positions, and instead ordered 100 rounds of artillery to be fired at a rate of four shells per hour. At 22:00, VC commander Hoang led his two companies out of Ap Tan Thoi and headed for their base camp in the Plain of Reeds, while the local force units left by a different route for their hideouts in the local area. The 1st Company, 261st Battalion, led the column, followed by litter carriers carrying the dead and wounded. The 1st Company, 514th Battalion, covered the tail of the formation, with one of their platoons acting as a rear guard. The wounded VC soldiers were transferred onto sampans at the canal on the east side of Ap Tan Thoi while the rest of the formation marched on. At 07:00 on 3 January, Hoang&#x27;s men successfully reached their destination without being detected.

==Aftermath==
On 3 January, Western journalists toured the deserted Ap Bac hamlet with American advisors. When reporter Neil Sheehan asked Brig. Gen. Robert York what had happened, the general replied: &quot;What the hell&#x27;s it look like happened, boy? They got away, that&#x27;s what happened&quot;! Shortly afterward, more than 18 hours too late, the South Vietnamese hit Ap Bac with an artillery barrage. The artillery rounds killed another five South Vietnamese soldiers and wounded 14 others. Vann, who had made key decisions in the early battle phases, blamed the South Vietnamese for the debacle. &quot;It was a miserable damn performance, just like it always is. These people won&#x27;t listen. They make the same mistake over and over again in the same way&quot;. According to Mark Moyar, in blaming the South Vietnamese, Vann wanted to conceal the Americans&#x27; flawed intelligence and poor leadership. He hoped to pressure the South Vietnamese to accept future changes he favored.

General Paul D. Harkins, commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much more optimistic assessment of the battle. He considered the operation a major success; after the VC abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins&#x27; evaluation of the battle&#x27;s success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent&#x27;s territory. The VC, however, was more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem&#x27;s regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins&#x27; resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.

The South Vietnamese units participating in the battle took heavy losses in their failed attempt to destroy the VC forces. South Vietnamese casualties included 83 killed in action and at least 100 wounded. The American participants, who included advisors and aircrews, counted three dead and eight wounded. Of the 15 American helicopters sent to support the operation, only one escaped undamaged, and five were downed or destroyed.

For the VC, the Battle of Ap Bac marked the first time they stood and fought a large South Vietnamese formation—despite being outnumbered by more than five to one. Against overwhelming odds, the VC had achieved their first &quot;de facto&quot; victory; they had successfully held off well-equipped ARVN forces supported by artillery and armored units as well as by American airpower. VC casualties were limited to 18 soldiers killed and 39 wounded, even though their positions had been hit by more than 600 rounds of artillery, napalm, and other ordnance released by 13 warplanes and five UH-1 gunships.

Ap Bac had far-reaching consequences for the South Vietnamese government and the American involvement in Vietnam. The battle was a milestone for the VC. For individual VC soldiers, the battle demonstrated they could defeat nominally superior ARVN forces, well equipped as they were with up-to-date military hardware and significant support and funding from the United States. Militarily, the morale and confidence of VC commanders and soldiers, who had experienced serious setbacks in the previous year, were greatly boosted. Politically, the VC 261st and 514th Battalions were able to exploit the prestige gained from having inflicted disproportionate losses on the ARVN forces to exercise greater influence in their areas of operations.

Despite the initial success of the Strategic Hamlet Program and the intensified military operations of 1962, the events at Ap Bac placed additional pressure on Diem&#x27;s government because they showed it was not prepared to cope with the resurgence of the VC, particularly in the Mekong delta.

<doc id="1271055" wikidata="Q1532902" url="?curid=1271055" title="Hamzah bin Hussein">
<text>Hamzah bin Al Hussein (; born 29 March 1980) is the fourth son of King Hussein bin Talal of Jordan overall and the first by his American-born fourth wife, Queen Noor. He was named Crown Prince of Jordan on 7 February 1999, a position he held until his older half-brother, King Abdullah II, rescinded it on 28 November 2004. He is a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, and is a 41st-generation direct descendant of Muhammad. 

Hamzah is reputed to be under house arrest since April 2021, after being accused of attempting to destabilise the Kingdom of Jordan and fomenting unrest. Hamzah officially renounced his title as prince in April 2022.

==Biography==
Prince Hamzah was born on 29 March 1980 at King Hussein Medical Center in Wadi Al-Seer, Amman, Hamzah bin Al Hussein claims ancestry with the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the Hashemite family. Queen Noor states in her autobiography that she and King Hussein named Hamzah after Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib.

Hamzah received his elementary education in Jordan and Amman, and then attended Harrow School in England. He then joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, passing out as a commissioned officer in the Jordan Arab Legion in December 1999, with a number of prizes including the Sandhurst Overseas Sword, granted to the best overseas cadet and the HRH Prince Saud Abdullah Prize, presented to the cadet with the best aggregate mark in academic subjects.

Serving then as an officer in the Jordan Arab Army&#x27;s 40th Armored Brigade, Hamzah attended a number of military courses and attachments in Jordan, the UK, Poland, Germany and the US. Currently holding the rank of Brigadier in the Jordan Arab Army, he served with the Jordan-United Arab Emirates force operating in former Yugoslavia under the umbrella of international peacekeepers. In the year 2006, he graduated from Harvard University.

Hamzah was sworn in as Regent on numerous occasions and deputized for King Abdullah II on a number of missions in the Kingdom and abroad. He headed the Royal Advisory Committee on the Energy Sector. He is also the Honorary President of the Jordan Basketball Federation, and is the chairman of the board of trustees of the Royal Automobile Museum, the President of the Royal Aero sports Club of Jordan and the President of Al-Shajarah (Tree) Protection Society.

Hamzah is a qualified rotor and fixed wing aircraft pilot, and participates in other sports such as Jujitsu and target-shooting.

==Succession issue==
On 7 February 1999, King Hussein died and his eldest son Prince Abdullah bin Al Hussein ascended to the throne of Jordan, having two weeks previously been designated to succeed his father as ruler in place of the king&#x27;s brother, Crown Prince Hassan bin Talal. On the same day, in compliance with his father&#x27;s wish, King Abdullah II decreed that he, in turn, would be succeeded not by a son of his own but by his half-brother, Hamzah, who was therefore accorded the title of crown prince.

Nearly six years later, on 28 November 2004, King Abdullah removed Hamzah as crown prince. In a letter from Abdullah to Hamzah, read on Jordanian state television, he declared the following:

No successor to the title was named at the time. Abdullah II confirmed that his son Hussein would succeed him by designating him as crown prince on 2 July 2009.

==House arrest==

On 3 April 2021, the BBC published a video of Hamzah in which he reported that he has been placed under house arrest as part of a crackdown on critics. It was stated that the video had been passed to the BBC through Hamzah&#x27;s lawyer. On 7 April 2021, King Abdullah II publicly hinted that his tension with Hamzah, who had pledged loyalty to him two days after his house arrest began, was ending and that Hamzah was now &quot;in his palace under my protection.&quot; Abdullah also stated that the crisis which resulted in Hamzah&#x27;s house arrest started when Jordan&#x27;s military chief of staff visited Hamzah and warned him to stop attending meetings with critics of the government. It was reported that Hamzah did not have the military or international support to launch a military coup. As such, some sources reported that the &quot;sedition&quot; was not a planned military coup, but rather a plan &quot;to push for protests that would appear to be a popular uprising with masses on the street&quot;, which would subsequently pressure Abdullah to abdicate in Hamzah&#x27;s favour. 

In April 2022, Hamzah relinquished his royal title of prince, stating his &quot;personal convictions&quot; were not in line with &quot;the approaches, trends and modern methods of our institutions&quot;. A month earlier, he had reportedly apologized to the King in a letter, wishing to &quot;turn the page on this chapter in our country&#x27;s and our family&#x27;s history&quot;. In May 2022, the King formally announced that Hamzah had been put under house arrest and his communications and movements were limited due to his &quot;erratic behavior and aspirations&quot;.

==Marriages and family==
Hamzah married his second cousin, Princess Noor bint Asem bin Nayef, at Al—Baraka Palace of Amman on 29 August 2003. The official wedding was held on 27 May 2004 at Zahran Palace. Hamzah and Noor divorced on 9 September 2009.

On 12 January 2012, Hamzah married Basmah Bani Ahmad Al-Outom. The couple issued a total of four daughters and two sons:
* Princess Zein bint Hamzah (born 3 November 2012)
* Princess Noor bint Hamzah (born 5 July 2014)
* Princess Badiya bint Hamzah (born 8 April 2016)
* Princess Nafisa bint Hamzah (born 7 February 2018)

<doc id="1271076" wikidata="Q630288" url="?curid=1271076" title="Juglans cinerea">
<text>Juglans cinerea, commonly known as butternut or white walnut, is a species of walnut native to the eastern United States and southeast Canada.

== Description ==
&quot;J. cinerea&quot; is a deciduous tree growing to tall, rarely more. Butternut is a slow-growing species, and rarely lives longer than 75 years. It has a stem diameter, with light gray bark.

The leaves are alternate and pinnate, long, with 11–17 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. Leaves have a terminal leaflet at the end of the leafstalk and have an odd number of leaflets. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves.

=== Flowering and fruiting ===

Like other members of the family Juglandaceae, butternut&#x27;s leafout in spring is tied to photoperiod rather than air temperature and occurs when daylight length reaches 14 hours. This can vary by up to a month in the northern and southernmost extents of its range. Leaf drop in fall is early and is initiated when daylight drops to 11 hours. The species is monoecious. Male (staminate) flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green slender catkins that develop from axillary buds and female (pistillate) flowers are short terminal spikes on current year&#x27;s shoots. Each female flower has a light pink stigma. The flowers of both sexes typically do not mature at the same time on an individual tree. 

The fruit is a lemon-shaped nut, produced in bunches of two to six together; the nut is oblong-ovoid, long and broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in midautumn. Rodents such as squirrels help distribute the seeds.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The distribution range of &quot;J. cinerea&quot; extends east to New Brunswick, and from southern Quebec west to Minnesota, south to northern Alabama and southwest to northern Arkansas. It is absent from most of the Southern United States. The species also proliferates at middle elevations (about above sea level) in the Columbia River basin/Pacific Northwest, as an off-site species. Trees with (over mature) class range diameter at breast height were noted in the Imnaha River drainage as late as January 26, 2015. Butternut favors a cooler climate than black walnut and its range does not extend into the Deep South. Its northern range extends into Wisconsin and Minnesota where the growing season is too short for black walnut.

== Ecology ==

=== Soil and topography ===
Butternut grows best on stream banks and on well-drained soils. It is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils. It grows better than black walnut, however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin. Butternut&#x27;s range includes the rocky soils of New England where black walnut is largely absent.

Butternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage. It is found up to an elevation of in the Virginias – much higher altitudes than black walnut. The nuts are eaten by wildlife.

=== Associated forest cover ===
Butternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest. It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types: sugar maple–basswood, yellow poplar–white oak–northern red oak, beech–sugar maple, and river birch–sycamore. Commonly associated trees include basswood (&quot;Tilia&quot; spp.), black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), black walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra&quot;), elm (&quot;Ulmus&quot; spp.), hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;), hickory (&quot;Carya&quot; spp.), oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), yellow poplar (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;), and yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;). In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with sweet birch (&quot;Betula lenta&quot;) and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;). Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas, it may be abundant. In the past, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee have been the leading producers of butternut timber. 

==== Canopy competition ====
Although young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above. It must be in the overstory to thrive. Therefore, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competition. 

=== Diseases ===
==== Butternut canker ====
The most serious disease of &quot;J. cinerea&quot; is butternut decline or butternut canker. In the past, the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, &quot;Melanconis juglandis&quot;. Now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, &quot;Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum&quot;. The fungus is spread by wide-ranging vectors, so isolation of a tree offers no protection.

Butternut canker first entered the U.S. around the beginning of the 20th century, when it arrived on imported nursery stock of Japanese walnut.

Symptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease is reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease.

==== Hybrid resistance ====
Butternut hybridizes readily with Japanese walnut. The hybrid between butternut and the Japanese walnut is commonly known as the &#x27;buartnut&#x27; and inherits Japanese walnut&#x27;s resistance to the disease. Researchers are back-crossing butternut to buartnut, creating &#x27;butter-buarts&quot; which should have more butternut traits than buartnuts. They are selecting for resistance to the disease. Most butternuts found as landscaping trees are buartnuts rather than the pure species.

==== Other pests ====
Bunch disease also attacks butternut. Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a mycoplasma-like organism. Symptoms include a yellow witches&#x27; broom resulting from sprouting and growth of auxiliary buds that would normally remain dormant. Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed. Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut.

The common grackle has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high.

Butternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally wind firm, it is subject to frequent storm damage.

== Conservation ==
The species is not listed as threatened federally in the US, but is listed as &quot;Special Concern&quot; in Kentucky, &quot;Exploitably Vulnerable&quot; in New York State, and &quot;Threatened&quot; in Tennessee. This species is also listed as &quot;Endangered&quot; in Illinois.

The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada placed the butternut on the endangered species list in Canada in 2005.

Approximately 60 grafted butternut trees were planted in a seed orchard in Huntingburg, Indiana, in 2012 as part of a larger effort by the USDA Forest Service to conserve the species and to breed resistance to butternut canker disease. Forest Service staff from the Hoosier National Forest, the Eastern Region National Forest genetics program, the Northern Research Station, and the Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center at Purdue University are involved in the project.

==Uses==
===Culinary uses===
The butternuts are edible and were made into a butter-like oil by Native Americans for various purposes. The young green nuts, while still soft, can be pickled; survivalist Bradford Angier recommends this be done with a change of salt water every other day for a week, and a subsequent seasoning of at least two weeks. The sap can be used to make syrup.

=== Lumber ===
Butternut wood is light in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much softer than black walnut wood. Oiled, the grain of the wood usually shows much light. It is often used to make furniture, and is a favorite of woodcarvers.

=== Fabric dye ===
Butternut bark and nut rinds were once often used to dye cloth to colors between light yellow and dark brown. The husks contain a natural yellow-orange dye. To produce the darker colors, the bark is boiled to concentrate the color. This appears to never have been used as a commercial dye, but rather was used to color homespun cloth.

In the mid-19th century, inhabitants of areas such as southern Illinois and southern Indiana – many of whom had moved there from the Southern U.S. – were known as &quot;butternuts&quot; from the butternut-dyed homespun cloth that some of them wore. Later, during the American Civil War, the term &quot;butternut&quot; was sometimes applied to Confederate soldiers. Some Confederate uniforms apparently faded from gray to a tan or light brown. It is also possible that butternut was used to color the cloth worn by a small number of Confederate soldiers. The resemblance of these uniforms to butternut-dyed clothing, and the association of butternut dye with home-made clothing, resulted in the derisive nickname.

=== Fishing ===
Crushed fruits can be used to poison fish, though the practice is illegal in most jurisdictions. Bruised fruit husks of the closely related black walnut can be used to stun fish.

== Famous specimens ==
The American Forest National Champion is located in Oneida, New York. In 2016 its circumference at breast height was , the height was , and the spread was .

The Bush butternut tree was planted by settler George Bush (1845) in current Tumwater, Washington, brought from Missouri. It was seriously damaged in a windstorm in 2015, and collapsed on May 1, 2021, at the age of 176 years.

Butternut wood has been found at the pre-Columbian Viking settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows at the northernmost tip of Newfoundland, an island where butternut does not grow and to which it therefore is presumed to have been transported from more southerly locations. The butternut log specimens found there were cut with European tools.

<text>CSS &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was a casemate ironclad that served as part of the James River Squadron of the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War. Laid down in 1862 and launched the following year, she did not see action until 1864 due to delays in receiving her armor and guns. After passing through the obstructions at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff in May 1864, she participated in several minor actions on the James River and fought in the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm from September 29 to October 1. On January 23 and 24, 1865, she was part of the Confederate fleet at the Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach, and was one of only two Confederate ships to make it past the obstructions at Trent&#x27;s Reach. After the Confederate attack failed, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; withdrew with the rest of the James River Squadron. On April 3, as the Confederates were abandoning Richmond, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; and the other vessels of the James River Squadron were burned. Her wreck was located in the 1980s, buried under sediment.

==Background and description==
In mid-1862, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was laid down by the Confederate States Navy in the Rocketts Landing area of Richmond, Virginia to a plan by the Chief Naval Constructor, John L. Porter. The ship was one of the ironclads built to Porter&#x27;s shallow-draft &quot;diamond hull&quot; configuration with a flat bottom and hull sides that met the base of the casemate at a 90° angle. By substituting straight lines and angles for the traditional keel and curving frame of the hull, Porter optimized his design to be quickly built by ordinary carpenters, rather than highly skilled shipwrights that were in short supply in the Confederacy, at the cost of being able to mount fewer guns than those ironclads built with traditional hulls. Their shallow draft and flat bottom restricted these ships to rivers and inland waters.

Porter supervised the work of constructing &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;, but it is uncertain how exactly he followed his design as surviving documents disagree in many ways. The plan showed an overall length of and a length between perpendiculars of with a maximum beam of , a moulded beam of and a depth of hold of . The naval historian Saxon T. Bisbee quotes a beam of with a depth of hold of and a draft of while US Navy historian Paul J. Marcello provides a figure of for the ironclad&#x27;s draft. She had a tonnage of 700 long tons. The ship&#x27;s casemate was shaped like a rectangle and Porter&#x27;s plan showed two pilothouses on the casemate&#x27;s roof, although operational reports from her captain make no mention of the rear pilothouse.

The Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond was contracted to produce her propulsion system, although Bisbee believes that it is possible that the Richmond-based Shockoe Foundry may have produced them. The ship was propelled by a pair of direct-acting steam engines that each drove a propeller. Porter&#x27;s plan shows &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; as having three horizontal boilers measuring 7 feet tall, in diameter, and long, but it is not known if the final construction varied from the blueprints or not. Bisbee believes that the boilers probably were of the fire-tube type. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; could move at a speed of about and had a crew of 150. She also carried about 20 to 25 Confederate States Marines in case of a battle that required naval boarding.

&quot;Fredericksburg&quot; eventually received her armament of one Brooke rifle on a pivot mount in the bow, two Brooke rifles, one on each broadside and a Columbiad muzzle-loading smoothbore gun on a pivot mounting in the stern. Naval historian Paul H. Silverstone states that she was armed with one smoothbore cannon, an rifled cannon, and two rifled cannons, and naval historian W. Craig Gaines states that she was armed with four rifled cannons.

Gaines states that she had of wrought-iron armor. The area where the casemate met the deck was armored with of iron, and the armor extended below the waterline. The top of the casemate consisted of 2-inch-thick iron bars, spaced apart. After the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm in September–October 1864, the ship&#x27;s captain recommended that additional iron bars be positioned between the bars to better protect the crew, although it is uncertain if this was ever done. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; had less armor than &quot;Virginia II&quot;, which gave her a lighter draft but made her comparatively weaker.

==Construction and career==
Named for the Virginia city, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;″s construction was partially funded from monies raised by women&#x27;s organizations for ship construction; the ship was one of several ironclads sometimes known as the &quot;Ladies Gunboats&quot;. An attempt to launch the warship on June 6, 1863, failed when the Confederates were unable to get her into the water, but another on June 11 was successful. Her fitting out was prolonged by a lack of iron, which was in short supply in the Confederacy. The shortage led to work on the ironclad being delayed until after &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was armored, as there was not enough metal available to work on both ships at the same time. The ship was complete, except for her armament by November 30. High waters on the James River in early 1864 threatened to wash away stockpiles of timber and inundate the shipyard&#x27;s wharves, further delaying her completion.

In March, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was commissioned and taken to Drewry&#x27;s Bluff on the James River, where she was fitted out, placed under the command of Commander Thomas R. Rootes. She was assigned to the James River Squadron. The James River Squadron had been commanded by Captain French Forrest until May 6, when Captain John K. Mitchell replaced Forrest. As of April 30, &quot;Fredericksburg″&quot;s armament was reported to be close, but not quite, complete, and she was still not fully ready when Mitchell took command. By May 15, she was fully ready for combat.

The vessels of the James River Squadron could not initially move downriver beyond Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, as the river had been obstructed there in 1862 to prevent Union incursions up the river. Pilings had been driven into the river which was also blocked with stone-filled cribs and blockships. However, in May 1864, the obstructions were partially dismantled to allow for a Confederate offensive against the Union vessels in the James. On May 23, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; passed through the remainder of the obstructions, and &quot;Virginia II&quot; and the ironclad passed through the next day. General P. G. T. Beauregard placed artillery batteries along the south side of the river to support the naval advance, but &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; suffered boiler damage on May 29 that required a day to repair. Mitchell was aware that the Union would have strong advantages in a naval battle, and he and his officers declined to attack. Union Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant moved across the James as part of an advance against Richmond in June, and established a supply depot at City Point on the James. The primary goal of the Union naval forces on the James became to protect City Point, and to further that goal, five blockships were sunk at Trent&#x27;s Reach, which was upriver from City Point.

On June 21, the James River Squadron and a Confederate shore battery known as Battery Dantzler bombarded Union ships stationed at Trent&#x27;s Reach. The naval fire was at a range of almost and was not effective. Union forces under the command of Major General Benjamin Butler began building the Dutch Gap Canal in August to try to bypass Confederate land defenses in the area. On August 13, Confederate naval forces fired on the Union troops building the canal. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; participated in the action, along with &quot;Virginia II&quot;, &quot;Richmond&quot;, and the gunboats , , and . The Confederate vessels fired approximately 147 shots during the engagement, but did little damage. The shooting lasted from 06:00 to 18:00, and about 30 Union soldiers were killed or wounded. Union return fire damaged &quot;Fredericksburg″&quot;s smokestack. Four days later, the three ironclads helped repulse a small Union attack against a Confederate position at Signal Hill, which was the location of a Confederate battery downstream from Drewry&#x27;s Bluff.

On September 29, Butler&#x27;s Union Army of the James attacked the Confederate land positions in the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm. The three Confederate ironclads were in the area, and were called upon to fire at the Union lines. Union troops took Fort Harrison, but were unable to capture Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. The ironclads participated in the fighting from September 29 to October 1. Their fire was effective and they suffered little damage, although a rifled cannon on &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; burst on September 30. The Union gains on land allowed them to construct a battery known as Fort Brady on the now-captured Signal Hill upriver from Battery Dantzler. While Battery Danztler still controlled part of the river for the Confederates and prevented Union ships from travelling upriver to Fort Brady, the Confederate vessels were unable to move downriver to Battery Danztler. On October 22, while patrolling the river, the James River Squadron was surprised by the presence of a Union shore battery which had been recently constructed upstream from Fort Brady. The three ironclads moved against the battery to allow the wooden gunboats of the fleet to escape, before falling back to Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; suffered minor damage during the engagement, with her smokestack and the roof to her casemate damaged.

===Trent&#x27;s Reach===
On October 24, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was sent upriver to the Rocketts area, where she was given a replacement cannon for the gun that had burst and had the roof of her casemate protected with iron bars. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;, &quot;Virginia II&quot;, and &quot;Richmond&quot; went down to Fort Brady on December 7 and exchanged fire with the Union position. Rootes did not command &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; due to illness from December 1864 until February 1865. Lieutenant Francis E. Shepperd commanded her for a time during December 1864, and from January 14 through 25, 1865. By the beginning of 1865, the situation was becoming bleaker for the Confederates due to several military defeats, and it was decided to risk an attack against the Union fleet on the James in hopes of breaking the blockade on the river and destroying the depot at City Point. The Union obstructions at Trent&#x27;s Reach had been damaged by high water, and part of the Union fleet had been transferred to North Carolina for operations against Fort Fisher. On the night of January 23/24, the Confederate fleet, composed of &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;, &quot;Richmond&quot;, &quot;Virginia II&quot;, &quot;Hampton&quot;, &quot;Drewry&quot;, &quot;Nansemond&quot;, the gunboats and , and the torpedo boats , , and moved downriver towards Trent&#x27;s Reach. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was in the lead as she had the lightest draft. The ships successfully passed Fort Brady in the darkness, but &quot;Torpedo&quot; ran aground not long after and had to be abandoned.

&quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was able to cross the Union obstructions at Trent&#x27;s Reach at about 01:30 on January 24, but suffered hull damage during the process. The damage caused the ship to spring a leak. While &quot;Hampton&quot; also passed the obstructions, none of the other Confederate ironclads could. &quot;Virginia II&quot; ran aground, and the Confederates decided not to push further that night and recalled &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; and &quot;Hampton&quot; back across the obstructions. &quot;Drewry&quot; also became grounded and was abandoned; Union fire sank her later in the morning and the resulting explosion pushed &quot;Scorpion&quot; towards Union lines, where she was captured. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; withdrew to Battery Dantzler. Union vessels arrived during the morning and reached the obstructions, firing on the now-freed &quot;Virginia II&quot;, and &quot;Richmond&quot; who were still in the process of moving upriver towards the battery. The two Confederate ironclads were able to reach the safety of Battery Dantzler, which provided fire support, striking the gunboat USS &quot;Massasoit&quot;. Union forces also brought up a Drummond light so that the river could be illuminated during nighttime. While the Confederates considered another attempt through the obstructions that night, it was decided not to risk a movement, and the surviving vessels of Mitchell&#x27;s squadron withdrew to Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. In addition to the hull damage from crossing the obstructions, &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; also lost an anchor during the affair.

Shortly after the battle at Trent&#x27;s Reach, Mitchell was replaced as commander of the James River Squadron by Admiral Raphael Semmes. Lieutenant Alphonse Barbot took command of &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; in February. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; was repaired, but did not see further action. On April 3, Semmes was informed that the Confederates were abandoning Richmond. The vessels of the James River Squadron were taken upriver from Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff to the obstructions at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, and the ships, including the ironclads, were burned early that morning. The men of the James River Squadron served on land, moving with the Confederate government to Danville, Virginia, before eventually surrendering in North Carolina. The wreck of &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; survived later dredging operations, despite being incompletely removed in 1871 and 1872, and the site was rediscovered in the 1980s. &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; lies parallel to the river, buried under to of sediment. Bisbee reports that the site has been heavily disturbed.
