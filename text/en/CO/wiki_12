==Career==

===Early life===
Michelle Wright was born on July 1, 1961, in Chatham, Ontario. Wright grew up in the small nearby town of Merlin where her parents were both local music performers. By 1980, when Wright was in college studying counseling for the mentally disadvantaged, she joined a local band with whom she performed until 1983.

That year Wright started her own band. She performed with her own band until 1988. In 1985, while performing with her band, Wright signed a record deal with Savannah Records. The next year she released her debut single, &quot;I Want to Count on You&quot;, which peaked at No. 48 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart.

Wright&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Do Right by Me&quot;, was issued in 1988 and produced seven more singles, including Wright&#x27;s cover of the 1974 Andy Kim hit, &quot;Rock Me Gently&quot;, which reached No. 7 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart. The album&#x27;s success in Canada led to a record contract with Arista Nashville. Wright became one of the label&#x27;s flagship artists.

===1990–1993: Breakthrough success===
In April 1990, Wright&#x27;s first American single, &quot;New Kind of Love&quot;, was issued and became her first &quot;Top Five&quot; hit in Canada, in addition to peaking at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart in the United States. Her second album, &quot;Michelle Wright&quot;, was released in July 1990. To support the album, Wright was added as an opening act to Kenny Rogers 1991 tour. The album became a success in Canada.

That year, 1990, Wright was awarded Female Artist of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association. The following year she was awarded Album of the Year for &quot;Michelle Wright&quot;, Single of the Year for &quot;New Kind of Love&quot;, and Female Artist of the Year again by the Canadian Country Music Association.

Due to the success of her album &quot;Michelle Wright&quot; and single &quot;New Kind of Love,&quot; Wright relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 to spend more time advancing her career. When in Nashville, Wright began to record her third album, &quot;Now and Then&quot;, released in May 1992. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;, became an instant hit, reaching No. 1 in Canada on the &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart and No. 10 in the United States on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart. In Canada, the song also crossed over to the adult contemporary charts, peaking at No. 18. The song received the Single of the Year award from the Canadian Country Music Association in late 1992.

In 1993, the album earned Wright the award for Top New Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music. She appeared on the CBS television special, &quot;Women of Country&quot;, where she performed &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot; and the Mary Chapin Carpenter song, &quot;The Hard Way,&quot; with several other artists including Carpenter. &quot;Now and Then&quot; went on to produce six more singles, including the Canadian number one hits &quot;One Time Around&quot; and &quot;Guitar Talk&quot;. The album also contained the single, &quot;He Would Be Sixteen&quot;, which reached No. 31 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart and No. 3 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart. It was awarded Single of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association in 1993. Also in 1993, Wright won the Fans&#x27; Choice Award from Canadian Country Music Association, which she would also win in 1995.

===1994–1999: Further success===
In 1994, Wright released the first single from her upcoming album, &quot;One Good Man&quot;, which became her fourth number one single in Canada; but it didn&#x27;t reach the top 40 in the United States. Wright&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;The Reasons Why&quot;, was released in September 1994 in Canada. Plans for the album to be released in the United States were delayed and eventually cancelled. The album was also released in Europe after a Wright completed a successful tour in mid-1994. In early 1995, Wright embarked on a 40-city tour in Canada, which at that time was the most extensive tour in the history of country music in Canada.

In August 1996, Wright released her fifth album, &quot;For Me It&#x27;s You&quot;, following the release of the first single, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Girl&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks and No. 57 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart. The album marked Wright&#x27;s first album to be released in the American market in four years. The album went on to be successful in Canada, producing three Top Five singles in &quot;Crank My Tractor&quot;, &quot;The Answer Is Yes&quot;, and &quot;What Love Looks Like&quot;. The album was not a success in the United States. In a 1997 interview with &quot;Jam!,&quot; Wright admitted that she was &quot;very disappointed&quot; and &quot;not happy with what [U.S. radio] did with this album&quot;.

During 1997, Wright was awarded the C.F. Martin Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association for her international work with the Special Olympics; her successful fundraising efforts for St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Chatham, Ontario, the hospital where she was born; and her support for the Manitoba flood relief fund.

In 1999, U.S. radio welcomed Wright back when her 1997 duet with pianist Jim Brickman was released to radio. The song, &quot;Your Love&quot;, failed at country radio, but gave Wright her only American adult contemporary hit when the song peaked at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. Despite the song&#x27;s success at AC radio, it would be Wright&#x27;s last charting single in the United States.

In October 1999, Wright&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;The Greatest Hits Collection&quot;, was released in Canada. The album included two new songs, &quot;I Surrender&quot; and &quot;When I Found You&quot;, both of which were Top Ten hits on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Tracks chart. In 2000, Arista Nashville released the American version of her 1999 greatest hits album in the United States. The album contained a different track list than the Canadian version. The album was Wright&#x27;s final release with Arista Nashville.

===2000–present: Success today===
In 2002, Wright was transferred to RCA Records/ViK. Recordings. That year she released her sixth studio album, &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot;, in June 2002. The album showed Wright in a more pop-driven styled than her previous work. Wright co-wrote eight of the album&#x27;s twelve songs, and recorded songs by successful songwriters such as Shelly Peiken, who wrote pop singer Christina Aguilera&#x27;s 1999 hit, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;. &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; also contained a more pop-oriented version of her 2000 single, &quot;I Surrender.&quot; This version had been used for the song&#x27;s music video and pop radio release.

In 2004, Wright started her annual Christmas tour, &quot;Dreaming of a Wright Christmas&quot;. A year later Wright signed with Icon Records and in October 2005, she released her first Christmas album, &quot;A Wright Christmas&quot; in Canada. The album featured covers of eleven Christmas song and one new song, &quot;I Know Santa&#x27;s Been Here&quot;, written by Canadian country singer Patricia Conroy. The song was issued as the album&#x27;s first single in December 2005. &quot;A Wright Christmas&quot; was released digitally in the United States 2007 and Europe in 2008.

In June 2006, Wright returned to country music by releasing her first new album in four years, &quot;Everything and More&quot; in Canada. In 2007, &quot;Everything and More&quot; was made available digitally in United States.

In 2011, Savannah Music Canada released Wright&#x27;s first live album, &quot;The Wright Songs: An Acoustic Evening with Michelle Wright&quot;. The album features seventeen tracks, including singles and unreleased album cuts.

Wright released a new single, &quot;Another Good Day,&quot; to Canadian country radio on April 24, 2012. She released a new single entitled &quot;Strong&quot; to radio in April 2013. Wright&#x27;s first album of original material in seven years, &quot;Strong&quot;, was released on July 9, 2013.

In 2015, Wright signed with Chuck Thompson, President of the Nashville-based Thompson Entertainment Group, for management.

In 2018, she signed with Navigator Records and the label released her first brand new music since the release of &quot;Strong&quot;. &quot;Lovin&#x27; This Day&quot; and &quot;Attitude Is Everything&quot; were released as singles with an &quot;old-school&quot; A side song and a B side song configuration across all digital platforms on the Navigator Records label.

For 2019, Navigator released Wright&#x27;s recording of the holiday classic &quot;Silver Bells,&quot; produced by fellow Canadian Bob Funk, to launch the &quot;A Wright Christmas: 2019&quot; with concert dates across Alberta and Ontario.

<doc id="1269741" wikidata="Q7753511" url="?curid=1269741" title="The New Art Gallery Walsall">
<text>The New Art Gallery Walsall is a modern and contemporary art gallery in the town of Walsall, in the West Midlands, England. It was built with £21 million of public funding, including £15.75 million from the UK National Lottery and additional money from the European Regional Development Fund and City Challenge.

The Gallery is funded by Walsall Council and Arts Council England; this funding is further supplemented by its own income generation. Admission is free. Its first Director was Peter Jenkinson. In May 2005, former BALTIC director Stephen Snoddy was appointed as director.

==Architecture==
Designed by the architects Caruso St John after winning an international design competition, it opened in January 2000, replacing the town&#x27;s old gallery and an arts centre that had been closed by the council almost a decade earlier. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 5 May 2000, during her visit to the West Midlands. The New Art Gallery&#x27;s stark building won several architectural awards and attracted over 237,000 visitors in its opening year. In 2000, the gallery was shortlisted for the prestigious Stirling Architecture Prize.

The five-story building is clad in pale terracotta and has a floor area of . The interior of the Gallery features a heavy use of concrete and 75mm thick douglas fir wooden cladding. The public square surrounding the building was designed by Richard Wentworth and Catherine Yass.

The Gallery has been seen as an attempt to encourage regeneration in the local area. The architecture has been both praised and criticised, described as &quot;almost flawless&quot; by the RIBA and &quot;extraordinarily good&quot; by Hugh Pearman but also castigated by John Stewart-Young as an &quot;architectural indulgence&quot;, an impressive building that lacks consideration of how the wider public will use it. The essayist Theodore Dalrymple described the interior as resembling both &quot;a fascist foreign ministry&quot; and &quot;a sauna of gigantic proportions&quot;.

There have been a number of minor alterations to the building since its opening, including changing of the ground floor retail area into a cafe, and addition of more windows around its entrance. In 2006, Floor 4 of the gallery was transformed from a restaurant area into a new gallery space. The gallery space with 8m high ceiling has enabled the Gallery to present a further programme of exhibitions, in addition to its main temporary exhibition galleries. This has included exhibitions by regional and international artists including David Batchelor, Richard Billingham and Leo Fitzmaurice.

In 2012, artist Sarah Staton was commissioned to design a new sculpture terrace for the Gallery, opening to the public later that same year the space converted a previously underused area of patio on floor 4.

==Collections==

The Gallery houses the fixed Garman Ryan Collection of sculptures and paintings by modern masters including a large selection of work by Jacob Epstein and many significant works by European artists including Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, Turner, Corot, Renoir and Constable represented in prints, sketches, drawings, paintings and sculptures. The collection was donated to the people of Walsall in 1973 by Epstein&#x27;s late wife Kathleen Garman (Lady Epstein) and her friend Sally Ryan.

In 2006, the gallery acquired the Epstein Archive, a collection of photographs, manuscripts, sketches and correspondence between Jacob Epstein and his family and friends, patrons, buyers and galleries. In 2009 Bob and Roberta Smith was commissioned to work alongside Archive Curator Neil Lebeter to reveal the previously undocumented and unseen Epstein Archive to audiences. The initiative forms part of New Ways of Curating, a project initiated by Arts Council England.

The permanent collection of artworks at the Gallery incorporates the municipal holdings built up from 1892, from the formal foundation of Walsall&#x27;s art collection. It ranges from Victorian paintings by Frank Holl and Briton Rivière, including some of local interest through to works by contemporary artists, such as Catherine Yass, Robert Priseman and Fiona Banner. Through the Contemporary Art Society Special Collection scheme, the New Art Gallery Walsall was able to add to its collections works by Gavin Turk, Hew Locke, Mike Nelson, Yoshihiro Suda, Dorothy Cross, Laura Ford, Darren Lago, Estelle Thompson, Richard Woods, Yinka Shonibare and Rose Finn-Kelcey. The works that comprise this collection transfer ownership to Walsall Council from the Contemporary Art Society in 2014.

In 2007, the New Art Gallery was awarded £1million through the Art Fund International to collect international contemporary art on the theme of the metropolis. This has included the acquisition of works by Jochem Hendricks, Grazia Toderi, Dynita Singh, Zhang Enli, Christiane Baumgartner, Barry McGee and Nicolas Provost.

==Exhibitions==
The temporary exhibition galleries on the third and fourth floor are dedicated to exhibiting contemporary and historic art. The Gallery has held solo exhibitions by artists including Suzanne Treister, Mark Titchner, Toby Ziegler, Conrad Shawcross, Hew Locke, Joana Vasconcelos, Zarina Bhimji, Christopher Le Brun, Gordon Cheung, Layla Curtis, Anna Barriball, Adam Dant Gavin Turk and Jonathan Yeo.

Between 2012 and 2013, the Gallery hosted the first year long display of works by artist Damien Hirst as part of the ARTIST ROOMS on Tour in partnership with Tate.

The New Art Gallery also has a history of exhibiting group shows, beginning with the inaugural exhibition &quot;Blue&quot; featuring works by artists such as Anish Kapoor, Glen Brown, Barbara Hepworth and Bridget Riley.

The 2009 exhibition &quot;Re-Imagining Asia&quot;, aimed to explore the meaning and relevance of the term “contemporary Asian art” in the 21st century and within a wider context of globalisation, migration and an increasingly international art world. It featured artists such as Song Dong, exhibiting here in the UK for the first time.

In 2010, the New Art Gallery celebrated its tenth birthday with the exhibition &quot;Party!&quot;.

In 2011, the Gallery hosted the exhibition &quot;The Life of The Mind: Love, Sorrow and Obsession&quot;, curated by artist Bob and Roberta Smith. This included key works by Sarah Lucas, Louise Bourgeois, Tracey Emin and Yayoi Kusama.

==Artist residencies==
The gallery has continually supported emerging and established artists from throughout the UK through their regular residency programs. Artists in residence include: 
a.a.s, 
Simon and Tom Bloor,
Sean Burn,
Faye Claridge, 
Lucienne Cole, 
Harminder Judge,
Juneau Projects, 
Karin Kihlberg and Reuben Henry,
Feng-Ru Lee,
Bob and Roberta Smith,

==Education work==

The Discovery Gallery, now rebranded Disco, was the first interactive art space of its kind in the country, designed specifically for young visitors and families. Over 60,000 school children have visited The New Art Gallery since 2003, along with 34,000 lifelong learning participants. The Gallery gained the Learning Outside the Classroom quality badge mark in 2009. The New Art Gallery Walsall was one of the first cultural organisations in the UK to take on a Creative Apprentice in 2009.

The Gallery, alongside Ikon Gallery, works in partnership with Birmingham City University to run the Artist Teacher Scheme, a professional development programme for art educators.

==Other facilities==

The New Art Gallery has free public Wi-Fi throughout the building.

In 2006, the Gallery opened a free public access Art Library, where visitors are able to learn about culture, exhibitions and award-winning architecture. Since opening nearly 50,000 people have made use of the specialist collection of books, journals and archive material.

The ground floor café in The New Art Gallery Walsall was transformed into a Costa Coffee store in August 2007.

<text>The First Battle of Chattanooga was a minor artillery battle in the American Civil War, fought on June 7–8, 1862.

==Background==

In late spring 1862, the Confederacy split its forces in Chattanooga, Tennessee into several small commands in an attempt to complicate Federal operations. Union Maj. Gen. Ormsby M. Mitchel received orders to take his division to Huntsville, Alabama, to repair railroads in the area. Soon, he occupied more than 100 miles along the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga and Memphis &amp; Charleston railroads. In May, Mitchel and his men sparred with Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s men.

==Battle==

After Mitchel received command of all Federal troops between Nashville and Huntsville on May 29, he ordered Brig. Gen. James Negley with a small division to lead an expedition to capture Chattanooga. This force arrived before Chattanooga on June 7. Negley ordered the 79th Pennsylvania Infantry out to reconnoiter. It found the Confederates entrenched on the opposite side of the river along the banks and atop Cameron Hill. Negley brought up two artillery batteries to open fire on the Rebel troops and the town and sent infantry to the river bank to act as sharpshooters. The Union bombardment of Chattanooga continued throughout June 7 and until noon on June 8. The Confederates replied, but it was uncoordinated since the undisciplined gunners were allowed to do as they wished. On June 10, Smith, who had arrived on June 8, reported that Negley had withdrawn and the Confederate loss was minor. This attack on Chattanooga was a warning that Union troops could mount assaults when they wanted. The attack also prompted Edmund Kirby Smith to withdraw Confederate troops from other areas to defend Chattanooga. This redeployment of troops allowed George W. Morgan to capture the Cumberland Gap on June 18, 1862.

==Battlefield preservation==

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved more than battlefield acres at Chattanooga as of mid-2023.

<doc id="1269756" wikidata="Q478135" url="?curid=1269756" title="Pylons of Cádiz">
<text>The Pylons of Cádiz, also known as the Towers of Cádiz, are two 158 m (518 ft)-tall pylons supporting a double-circuit 132 kV three-phase AC powerline over the bay of Cádiz, Spain, running from Puerto Real Substation to the substation of the former Cádiz Thermal Power Station, situated on the peninsula upon which the city of Cádiz stands.

== Description ==
The suspension towers are situated in Cádiz near Fort Puntales and the Puntales Naval Station and at Matagorda quarter near the commercial wharves. The crossing consists of 16 pylons: two suspension pylons, both 158 metres (518 feet) tall, that carry the line over the Bay of Cádiz, two strainer portals built of concrete, and at each strainer portal a group of 6 monopolar strainers, which are used to carry the conductors from the strainer portal to the first standard line tower (at the northern end of the span) respectively to the switchyard of Cádiz Substation (at the southern end of the span). The strainer portal at the southern end is situated close to Cádiz Substation, that of the northern end at Matagorda. The rest of the line consists of pylons with three crossbars carrying six conductors. The powerline crossing does not use a ground conductor in the span section despite its great height.

== Design and construction ==
Each tower is a hollow mast resembling a truncated cone (or frustum). The diameter of the frustum decreases from 20.7 metres at the base to six metres at the top. The towers, which rest on reinforced concrete plinths carry on their pinnacle a single crossbar with rhomboid profile, on which the insulators carrying the conductors are fixed. A helical staircase winds its way up the interior of the structure to the top.

This unconventional design was conceived and designed by Italian engineer Alberto M. Toscano. It was chosen because Spanish steel mills were unable to produce massive steel carriers at the time, and importing such carriers was impossible in Francoist Spain.

The construction was carried out under the supervision and direction of Remo Scalla, a close friend of Toscano. The same team of Toscano, the designer, and Scalla, the builder, also joined forces in building the Pylons of Messina which support the lines that span the Strait of Messina, between Calabria, on the mainland of Italy, and the island of Sicily. The Cádiz project started during the latter part of 1957 and concluded in 1960. Upon completion, the towers were acquired by the Spanish National Institute of Industry.

<text>Bhojpur () is one of the two urban municipalities of Bhojpur District of Province No. 1 of Nepal.

Bhojpur is the traditional home of the Kirat Rai people and has a long history since the settlement of the Kirat Rai people. Bhojpur bazaar is famous for its metalwork, particularly khukuri knives and Karuwa (metal vessels). It is home to many businesses as well as skilled craftsmen. Other major towns in the district include Dingla to the north, Ghoretar to the south, and Taksar near the airstrip, from where flights connect to Biratnagar and Kathmandu.

The design and construction of the 240 km Koshi Highway in east Nepal between Dharan on the Terai Plain and Num in the Middle Himalaya commenced in the early 1970s and was completed in 2012 when the first vehicles were able to drive to Num. Construction of this highway links Bhjopur to other major cities and towns like Hile, Dhankuta and Dharan.

Historically it is a part of Majh Kirat (middle Kirat/ Khambuwan), and used to be called &quot;east number 4&quot;. Middle Kirat consists mainly of Bhojpur and Khotang districts, the traditional home of kirat Rai people, an indigenous ethnic group of Nepal. In addition to Rais, other ethnic groups include castes like Chhetris, Bahuns, and Dalits.

<doc id="1269763" wikidata="Q3345046" url="?curid=1269763" title="New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island">
<text>The New Democratic Party of Prince Edward Island (NDP PEI) is a social democratic political party in Prince Edward Island, Canada. It is a provincial section of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP).

==CCF==
The NDP&#x27;s predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), began in 1936 when a CCF club was founded in the Bedeque region during a visit by CCF MP Ted Garland. But the Island CCF did not run candidates until 1943 when the national party made a concerted effort to rally the party by sending an organizer to recruit several candidates to run in the 1943 provincial election. Later that year, a founding convention was held with York South MP Joseph Noseworthy as guest speaker. Irving Toombs was elected president and Douglas MacFarlane provincial secretary.

The CCF ran candidates on the Island in the 1945 federal election, for the first time federally, and again in a provincial by-election in December. In the 1947 provincial election, the CCF contested 16 seats. The party only contested five seats in the 1951 election, however, due to bad road conditions and high deposits. The CCF&#x27;s candidate that year in 3rd Prince, Hilda Ramsay, became the first woman ever to run in a PEI provincial election.

While not contesting any further provincial elections, the CCF ran one candidate in PEI in the 1953 federal election, three in the 1957 federal election and one in 1958.

==NDP==
The NDP PEI was founded at a convention in Charlottetown on November 25, 1961, three months after the founding of the New Democratic Party of Canada. Federal leader Tommy Douglas addressed the meeting and Ian Webster was elected provincial president and Lorne Perry vice president. The NDP went on to stand a full slate of four candidates in PEI during the 1962 federal election and, thereafter, ran full slates on the island during federal elections.

The 1968 federal election saw Charlottetown teacher David Hall in Hillsborough make the party&#x27;s strongest showing. He was subsequently chosen as the PEI NDP&#x27;s first provincial leader. The party contested three provincial by-elections in 1972, its first attempt at provincial seats since the CCF days, and received 5.2 per cent of the total vote. Aquinas Ryan, a school principal from Morell in Kings County, led the party into the 1974 provincial general election and got 5.9% of the vote, but due to internal bickering, the party fell in the polls.

===1993–2007===
In the 1993 election, under the leadership of Larry Duchesne, the party share of the popular vote rose to 5.4%. Dr. Herb Dickieson took over as leader, and changed the name of the party from the PEI NDP, to the &quot;Island New Democrats&quot;. In the 1996 election, the party captured 7.8% of the vote, and Dr. Dickieson was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island for the riding of West Point-Bloomfield. He was the first member of a third party to ever win a seat to the PEI Legislative Assembly. Dr. Dickieson narrowly lost his seat in the 2000 election despite the party&#x27;s overall popular vote rising to 8.4%.

During the 2003 provincial election, the party lacked funds and were poorly organized. The party lost its base of support, only capturing 3% of the popular vote. Some within the party credit this to the return to the Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island of many voters who left the party following the Liberal provincial government&#x27;s decision to reduce wages of all public employees by 7.5% in the early 1990s. The budget for the 2003 election was estimated to be around $30,000, compared to nearly $1 million for each of the other parties.

Robichaud resigned as leader on June 23, 2005, for health reasons after battling inoperable lung cancer for two years and died shortly afterward. He was replaced in 2006 by Dean Constable, a theatre stage manager for the Charlottetown Festival.

===2007–present===
The party performed poorly in the 2007 election, finishing behind the Green Party of Prince Edward Island with just 1.96% of the total vote or 3.48% in contested ridings. They finished fourth behind the Liberal, Progressive Conservative and Green parties. Dean Constable announced his resignation as leader on August 26, 2007. The party announced it would appoint an interim leader at or before its annual general meeting in November 2007, and hold a leadership convention in April 2008.

James Rodd took the job of interim leader after Dean Constable&#x27;s resignation, and was elected leader on a permanent basis on April 4, 2009. He led the party into the 2011 election, where the party ran 14 candidates and was soundly defeated with 3.16% of the total vote or 5.84% in contested ridings. On February 8, 2012, Rodd announced that he would resign as leader.

On October 13, 2012, the NDP elected Michael Redmond as the new leader by a vote of 152 to 28 against party activist Trevor Leclerc. Under Redmond&#x27;s leadership, in March 2013 the party placed second in a provincial public opinion poll, ahead of the Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative Party, for the first time in its history. The party ran a full slate of candidates (27), but was again shut out of the legislature when it failed to win a seat in the 2015 election. Redmond resigned as leader of the party on December 6, 2017.

There was a leadership convention on April 7, 2018 that elected Joe Byrne as the new leader. Byrne resigned as leader on September 1, 2020.

Michelle Neill was confirmed party leader on April 23, 2022.

<text>Thomas Usk (died 4 March 1388) was appointed the under-sheriff of London by Richard II in 1387. His service in this role was brief and he was hanged in the following year.

== His life ==
Born in London, Usk was a petty bureaucrat, scrivener, and author. The Westminster Chronicle records his inglorious death.

== Author of &quot;The Testament of Love&quot; and Contemporary of Chaucer ==
Born in London, he is the author of &quot;The Testament of Love,&quot; which was once thought to be by Geoffrey Chaucer. Usk was a Collector of Customs from 1381 to 1384, when Geoffrey Chaucer was the Comptroller of Customs. 
If they were not familiar with each other, Usk at least was familiar with Chaucer&#x27;s poetry. In &quot;The Testament of Love,&quot; the god of Love praises &quot;mine own true servant, the noble philosophical poet in English&quot; who had written a poem on Troilus (i.e. Chaucer).

== Informant ==
Usk had been servant to John Northampton when the latter was Lord Mayor of London from 1381 to 1383. In 1384, he was arrested and released in exchange for informing against Northampton, for he had no desire, he said, to be &quot;a stinking martyr.&quot; This earned him the enmity of the party led by the Duke of Gloucester.

== Imprisonment, appeal and execution ==
When Gloucester&#x27;s party gained power through the Merciless Parliament Usk was prosecuted in 1388 and sentenced to be drawn, hanged, and beheaded, with his head put up over Newgate.

&quot;The Testament of Love&quot; is an allegorical prose work written in prison to seek aid. Walter Skeat found that the initial letters of the sections formed an acrostic saying, &quot;MARGARET OF VIRTU HAVE MERCI ON TSKNVI.&quot; Properly decoded, the last word is &quot;THINUSK,&quot; or &quot;thin[e] Usk.&quot;

Usk had been a Lollard, but he was brought back to the Roman Catholic Church while in prison. He was hanged at Tyburn in March 1388, and after his body was taken down it was decapitated after thirty strokes of the axe.

<doc id="1269779" wikidata="Q2543997" url="?curid=1269779" title="Siege of Ladysmith">
<text>The siege of Ladysmith was a protracted engagement in the Second Boer War, taking place between 2 November 1899 and 28 February 1900 at Ladysmith, Natal.

==Background==
As war with the Boer republics appeared likely in June 1899, the War Office in Britain dispatched a total of 15,000 troops to Natal, expecting that if war broke out they would be capable of defending the colony until reinforcements could be mobilized and sent to South Africa by steamship. Some of these troops were diverted while returning to Britain from India; others were sent from garrisons in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Lieutenant General Sir George White was appointed to command this enlarged force. White was 64 years old and suffered from a leg injury incurred in a riding accident. Having served mainly in India, he had little previous experience in South Africa.

==Outbreak of war==
Contrary to the advice of several British officials such as Sir Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, the Boer governments were not over-awed by the dispatch of British troops to Natal. Instead, they regarded it as evidence of Britain&#x27;s determination to seize control of the Boer republics. The Transvaal government under President Paul Kruger considered launching an attack in September, but President Steyn of the Orange Free State, who would later become the spiritual heart of the Boer resistance, dissuaded them for several weeks while he tried to act as intermediary. With the complete breakdown in negotiations, both republics declared war and attacked on 12 October.

A total of 21,000 Boers advanced into Natal from all sides. White had been advised to deploy his force far back, well clear of the area of northern Natal known as the &quot;Natal Triangle&quot;, a wedge of land lying between the two Boer republics. Instead, White deployed his forces around the garrison town of Ladysmith, with a detachment even further forward at Dundee. The entire British force could concentrate only after fighting two battles at Talana Hill and Elandslaagte. As the Boers surrounded Ladysmith, White ordered a sortie by his entire force to capture the Boer artillery. The result was the disastrous Battle of Ladysmith, in which the British were driven back into the town having lost 1,200 men killed, wounded, or captured.

==Siege==

The Boers then proceeded to surround Ladysmith and cut the railway link to Durban. Major General John French and his chief of staff, Major Douglas Haig escaped on the last train to leave, which was riddled with bullets.

The town was then besieged for 118 days. White knew that large reinforcements were arriving, and could communicate with British units south of the Tugela River by searchlight and heliograph. He expected relief soon. Meanwhile, his troops carried out several raids and sorties to sabotage Boer artillery.

Louis Botha commanded the Boer detachment which first raided Southern Natal, and then dug in north of the Tugela to hold off the relief force. On 15 December 1899, the first relief attempt was defeated at the Second Battle of Colenso. Temporarily unnerved, the relief force commander, General Redvers Buller, suggested that White either break out, or surrender after destroying his stores and ammunition. White could not break out because his horses and draught animals were weak from lack of grazing and forage, and he refused to surrender.

On Christmas Day 1899, the Boers fired a fuseless carrier shell into the town. It contained a Christmas pudding, two Union Flags and the message: &quot;Compliments of the season&quot;. The shell is still kept in the museum at Ladysmith.

==Battle of Wagon Hill (or Platrand)==

The Boers around Ladysmith were also growing weak from lack of forage. With little action, many fighters took unauthorised leave or brought their families into the siege encampments. Eventually, with the Tugela in flood, preventing Buller from giving any support, some younger Boer leaders persuaded General Piet Joubert to order a storming attempt on the night of 5 January 1900, before another relief attempt could be made.

The British line south of Ladysmith ran along a ridge known as the Platrand. The occupying British troops had named its features Wagon Hill to the west, and Caesar&#x27;s Camp (after features near Aldershot, well known to much of the British army) to the east. Under Colonel Ian Hamilton, they had constructed a line of forts, sangars and entrenchments on the reverse slope of the Platrand, of which the Boers were unaware.

In the early hours of 6 January 1900, Boer storming parties under General C. J. de Villiers began climbing Wagon Hill and Caesar&#x27;s Camp. They were spotted and engaged by British working parties who were emplacing some guns. The Boers captured the edge of both features, but could not advance further. British counter-attacks also failed. At noon, de Villiers made another attack on Wagon Hill. Some exhausted defenders panicked and fled, but Hamilton led reserves to the spot and recaptured some empty gun pits. Late in the afternoon, a terrific rainstorm broke, and the Boers withdrew under cover of it. The British suffered 175 killed and 249 wounded. 52 dead Boers were left in the British positions, but their total casualties were not recorded.

==Later siege and relief==
While Buller made repeated attempts to fight his way across the Tugela, the defenders of Ladysmith suffered increasingly from shortage of food and other supplies, and from disease, mainly enteric fever (typhoid), which claimed many lives. The Boers had long before captured Ladysmith&#x27;s water supply, and the defenders could use only the muddy Klip River. Towards the end of the siege, the garrison and townsfolk were living largely on their remaining draught oxen and horses (mainly in the form of &quot;chevril&quot;, a meat paste named after the commercial beef extract &quot;Bovril&quot;).

Eventually, Buller broke through the Boer positions on 27 February. Following their succession of reverses, his troops had developed effective tactics based on close co-operation between the infantry and artillery. After the protracted struggle, the morale of Botha&#x27;s men at last broke and they and the besiegers retreated, covered by another huge thunderstorm. Buller did not pursue, and White&#x27;s men were too weak to do so.

The first party of the relief column under Major Hubert Gough, who was accompanied by war correspondent Winston Churchill, rode in on the evening of 28 February. Soon afterwards, as the townspeople celebrated, White made a speech at the town&#x27;s post office to thank them for their fortitude, and reportedly said: &quot;but, thank God, we kept the flag flying&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Four Victoria Crosses (two posthumous) were awarded following the siege: 
* Trooper Herman Albrecht (Imperial Light Horse) and Lieutenant Robert Digby-Jones (Royal Engineers) jointly led the assault on Wagon Hill, and repelled the initial Boer attack, but both were killed in the ensuing mêlée.
* Lieutenant James Masterson (1st Battalion, Devonshire Regiment) delivered an urgent despatch despite suffering serious wounds during the Battle of Wagon Hill on 6 January 1900.
* Second Lieutenant John Norwood (5th Dragoon Guards) rescued a wounded comrade under heavy fire during a patrol on 30 October 1899.

Sir George White had no doubts about the need to hold Ladysmith, describing it as &quot;a place of primary importance&quot; because of its railway junction, which would have enabled the Free State and Transvaal armies to unite. Churchill commented that Ladysmith was an essential component of the Boer campaign strategy because &quot;they scarcely reckoned on a fortnight&#x27;s resistance; nor in their wildest nightmares did they conceive a four months&#x27; siege terminating in the furious inroad of a relieving army&quot;.

The British artist John Henry Frederick Bacon depicted &quot;The Relief of Ladysmith&quot; in a painting which shows people celebrating on 28 February 1900, as White shakes hands with Colonel Dundonald (representing Buller) at Pieter&#x27;s Hill, just outside the town. Bacon&#x27;s work became known as the &quot;Bovril War Picture&quot; after its photogravure was sponsored by the company, and offered free to anyone who collected a sufficient number of coupons from each jar of the product.

==Medical treatment during the siege==
Early in the siege, an agreement between White and Joubert led to the creation of the neutral &quot;Intombi Military Hospital&quot; some outside Ladysmith. It was run by Major-General David Bruce and his wife Mary. During the siege, the number of beds in the hospital camp grew from an initial 100 to over 1,900. A total of 10,673 admissions were received and treated at Intombi. One train per day was allowed to carry wounded from Ladysmith to Intombi.

==Notable casualties during the siege==
Arthur Stark, English author of &quot;The Birds of South Africa&quot;, was resident in the town&#x27;s Royal Hotel. On the evening of 18 November 1899, when he was standing on the hotel&#x27;s veranda, he was hit by shellfire from Pepworth Hill and suffered serious leg injuries. He died soon afterwards while undergoing surgery, and was buried in Ladysmith. H. W. Nevinson attended his funeral, and recorded the irony of Stark having been vociferously opposed to British war policy.

George Warrington Steevens, British author and war correspondent, died of enteric fever on 15 January 1900. He had been attached to Sir George White&#x27;s force, and had sent many articles back to Britain. These were published posthumously in &quot;From Capetown to Ladysmith&quot;.

<text>Hindustani Lal Sena (, &#x27;Indian Red Army&#x27;) was an anticolonial guerrilla group in India. It was formed on 13 April 1939 (on the anniversary day of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre). It was founded by Maganlal Bagdi and Pandit Shyam Narain Kashmiri along with their associates.
In Calcutta, 1943, a secret plan of subversion was planned on the advice of many national leaders. The plan was to blow away the railway route from the cave located between Nagpur and Bombay, with a
dynamite blurring so that the contact with a large part of Bombay was broken. For successful execution of the plan it was necessary to take the support of the revolutionaries of Nagpur. At that time the great revolutionary of the Nagpur was the founder of‘Hindustan Red Army&#x27;, Maganlal Bagdi. Bhanwarmal Singhi along with Prabhudayal Vidyarthi, a close associate of Gandhi, went to Nagpur to meet Maganlal Bagdi. who assured him to give them full support.

<text>The Republican Turkish Party (, CTP) is a social-democratic political party in Northern Cyprus. The party was founded in 1970 by Ahmet Mithat Berberoğlu, a lawyer, in opposition to the leadership of Fazıl Küçük and Rauf Denktaş.

On 30 June 2008, the Republican Turkish Party became a consultative member of the Socialist International (voted in by all members except the Greek Cypriot Movement for Social Democracy). It became a full member of the organization in 2014.

== Policies and ideology ==

The CTP is a social democratic political party, positioned on the centre-left on the political spectrum. The party espoused a pro-Soviet stance during the Cold War, especially under the leadership of Özker Özgür. However, the party never described itself as explicitly communist. Under Özgür, the party held rapprochement meetings with the Greek-Cypriot dominated leftist party of Cyprus, the Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL). Under Mehmet Ali Talat, the party shifted towards its current moderate leftist position.

On the Cyprus dispute, the CTP traditionally favours a pragmatic approach, and supports the reunification of the island. During the presidency of former CTP leader Mehmet Ali Talat, the party led reunification talks with the Republic of Cyprus.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===

The Republican Turkish Party was established in 1970 by Ahmet Mithat Berberoğlu, in opposition to Rauf Denktaş, and later his National Unity Party (UBP). The CTP was further vocally opposed to Fazıl Küçük, who served as the first Vice President of the Republic of Cyprus. The CTP was led by Özker Özgür between 1976 and 1996; Özgür also served as Deputy prime minister in the aftermath of the 1993 legislative election.

=== 21st century ===

Mehmet Ali Talat became party leader in 1996, taking over from Özgür. Under his leadership, the party lost seven seats in the 1998 elections, becoming the fourth largest party in Northern Cyprus. However, in 2003, he led the party to victory, scoring over 35% of the vote, and taking 19 of the 50 seats in the Assembly of the Republic. The following year, Talat formed a government and became prime minister on 13 January 2004. He stepped down in 2005, after winning that year&#x27;s presidential election; he went on to serve a single term as President of Northern Cyprus, until 2010. During his presidency, Talat conducted weekly meetings with the Greek Cypriot president, Demetris Christofias. The two leaders discussed issues such as power-sharing, armed forces, land ownership, and other problems that would arise in the event of reunification of the island.

Ferdi Sabit Soyer served as leader of the CTP for a certain period, and became prime minister in April 2005 after Talat&#x27;s presidential victory, serving until May 2009. The CTP lost the 2009 legislative election to the National Unity Party, and entered into opposition in the Assembly of the Republic.

After winning the 2013 elections with 38% of the vote and 21 seats, the CTP chairman Özkan Yorgancıoğlu, in office since 2011, became prime minister of Northern Cyprus on 2 September 2013. His government also included the rightist Democratic Party (DP). In the 2015 presidential elections, CTP fielded Sibel Siber as their candidate. However, Siber took just under 23% of the vote, and was eliminated in the first round of voting. As a result, Özkan Yorgancıoğlu resigned as prime minister two months later; Ömer Kalyoncu, also of the CTP, then formed a grand coalition with the National Unity Party. On 16 April 2016, the CTP government was ousted by a coalition led by Hüseyin Özgürgün, consisting of the National Unity Party and the Democrats, who together ruled Northern Cyprus as a minority government until 2018.

The Republican Turkish Party was returned to power following the 2018 elections. Despite dropping from 38% of the popular vote and first place in 2013 to only 21% and second place, the party was able to put together a four-party coalition, which also included the People&#x27;s Party, the Communal Democracy Party and the Democratic Party, and held 27 of the 50 seats in parliament. The leader of CTP, Tufan Erhürman, was appointed Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus by President Mustafa Akıncı on 2 February 2018.

<doc id="1269793" wikidata="Q278099" url="?curid=1269793" title="Laysan finch">
<text>The Laysan finch (Telespiza cantans) is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper, that is endemic to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It is one of four remaining finch-billed Hawaiian honeycreepers and is closely related to the smaller Nihoa finch. The Laysan finch is named for Laysan, the island to which it was endemic on its discovery. It was subsequently introduced to a few other atolls, and its historical range included some of the main islands.

==Description==

The Laysan finch is a large honeycreeper with a heavy bill. Overall the male has yellow plumage with a whitish belly and a grey neck. The female is duller than the male, with brown streaking. It is almost impossible to confuse the Laysan finch with any other bird in the field as it is the only passerine species found on the few islands it lives on.

==Range and behavior==

===Range===
On its discovery, the Laysan finch was an endemic resident of the small island of Laysan, along with the Laysan rail (&quot;Porzana palmeri&quot;), the Laysan honeycreeper (&quot;Himatione fraithii&quot;), the Laysan duck (&quot;Anas laysanensis&quot;), and the Laysan millerbird (&quot;Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris&quot;). Populations were introduced to several islands, including Pearl and Hermes Atoll, where the species persists, and Midway Atoll, where it survived until the introduction of rats. The fossil record shows that the finch once had a greater range in Hawaii, reaching as far as Oahu, and that birds on Laysan represent a relict population.

===Behavior===

The Laysan finch nests in vegetation, laying three eggs in a cup-shaped nest. These are incubated for 16 days by the female, the male in turn feeding the female. The chicks fledge after three weeks and are cared for by the parents for another three weeks.

The Laysan finch is a generalist, feeding on seeds, small insects, fruit, carrion (of seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals), and the eggs of nesting seabirds. While unable to break into the eggs of the larger seabirds (such as albatross and boobies) they will scavenge from them. They actively take the eggs of smaller seabirds such as those of white tern (&quot;Gygis alba&quot;) and the endemic Laysan duck (&quot;Anas laysanensis&quot;).

==Conservation==
The Laysan finch is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN because of its highly restricted range and vulnerability to extremes of weather, and it is considered endangered by the State of Hawaii and U.S. government. It survived the devastating effects of the introduction of domestic rabbits on Laysan Island (unlike the Laysan millerbird, honeycreeper and rail) by taking carrion and seabird eggs. However, this caused their population to shrink to fewer than 100 individuals and the bottleneck caused a reduction in genetic diversity that may have put the species at increased risk of extinction. The birds also suffered a loss of heterozygosity following founding events on other islands which may have caused an accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles in the populations.

Laysan is now part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The population is considered stable with the biggest threat being uncontrollable climate change.

Being the fourth largest town in the Free State (after Bloemfontein, Welkom and Bethlehem), Kroonstad lies approximately two hours&#x27; drive along the N1 from Gauteng. It is the second-largest commercial and urban centre in the Northern Free State (after Welkom), and an important railway junction on the main line from Cape Town to Johannesburg.

==History==

Kroonstad was established in 1855 by the Irish pioneer Joseph Orpen, and was the first town founded after the independence of the Orange Free State. It was chosen as the capital of the state, a dignity it held from the March 13 to May 11 1900. On the following day the town was occupied by Lord Roberts. The linking of the town in 1906 with the Colony of Natal made the route via Kroonstad the shortest railway connection between Cape Town and Durban.

While &quot;&quot; means &quot;crown&quot;, this was in fact the name of a horse that had drowned in the nearby ford. A lover of animals, Orpen had witnessed the incident, and named the infant settlement in honour of the unfortunate creature. Similarly, the ford in question came to be known as &quot;Kroondrift&quot;.

During the Second Boer War, from 13 March to 11 May 1900, the city became the capital of the Orange Free State, and subsequently the site of a concentration camp to contain Boer women and children.

==Economy==

The main industry of Kroonstad is agriculture. It is the centre of a rich agricultural district, producing maize, wheat, dairy and meat products and wool. The Bloemhoek Dam lies just east of the town and supplies much of its water needs. A caravan park and many more camp sites on the banks of the willow-lined Vals River () are frequented by anglers and watersport enthusiasts.

==Leisure==
Leisure opportunities are plentiful in Kroonstad, where visitors can enjoy golf on the 18-hole course in the town, lion tours and interaction with lion and tiger cubs at the Boskoppie Lion and Tiger Park, fishing in the well stocked Vals River or on the Bloemhoek Dam, and boating on the Serfontein Dam. Horseriding, gliding and hiking trails are also available.

==Transport==
===Road===

Kroonstad lies directly on the N1, which bypasses the town centre to the east (to Johannesburg in the north and Bloemfontein in the south). Other regional roads in the town are the R34 to Odendaalsrus in the south-west and Heilbron in the east, the R76 to Steynsrus in the south-east and Viljoenskroon in the north-west, the R721 to Vredefort in the north-west and the R82 to Sasolburg in the north-east.

===Rail===

Kroonstad Railway Station serves the town and is located on the important railway junction from Cape Town to Johannesburg via Bloemfontein.

On 4 January 2018, a passenger train, operated by Shosholoza Meyl, collided with a truck on a level crossing near Kroonstad/Hennenman. The train was derailed, and at least one of the carriages caught fire. Twenty people were killed and 260 were injured.

===Air===

Kroonstad is served by a small airport with no passenger flights.

==Shopping==

Shopping in Kroonstad is characterised by typical high street shopping. The development of the new Kroonstad Water Front Mall is underway, Maokeng Mall, Panorama Plaza, Checkers Centre, Shoprite Centre, Ultra City Centre and Pick n Pay centre.

==General attractions==
Kroonstad is said to be one of the Free State&#x27;s loveliest towns and lies on the banks of the Vals River, a tributary of the Vaal, roughly two hours&#x27; drive from Johannesburg. It is situated in an area characterised by open spaces and an abundant variety of vegetation that makes it particularly beautiful. Kroonstad is a quaint town that serves as a good stop over en route between Johannesburg and Bloemfontein, lying as it does at virtually the halfway mark. Kroonstad offers an array of activities that include flea markets, a tea garden, fishing on the Vals River or at the Bloemhoek Dam, walking trails and lion tours and lion and tiger interaction at Boskoppie Lion and Tiger park. Today, as an important administrative, agricultural and educational centre, Kroonstad still boasts much of the inherent rugged beauty which led the Voortrekkers to establish the town where they did.

Sporting facilities of all kinds are well catered for, notably for jukskei, an Afrikaner folk sport. The headquarters of the SA Jukskei Council has been established here since 1951. The city is rich in historical sights; several historic buildings and statues, a former concentration camp, the Sarel Cilliers Museum (although currently inactive) and other places of national interest can be found here. Kroonstad is an important agricultural service centre in the Free State with a predominantly agricultural-orientated economy served by a modern toll-road. This brings the PWV Region within two hours drive from Kroonstad as well as being accessible from the North West, Bloemfontein and the Eastern Free State.

In July 2022 Kroonstad was announced as the winner in the Kwêla Dorp Van Die Jaar competition.

==Historical sites==

The Bloemspruit Monument commemorates those who died in the Kroonstad Concentration Camp,

A Garden of Remembrance commemorates Allied soldiers fallen in the two World Wars.

A blockhouse south of the city is a reminder of later stages of the Second Boer War.

Stone corbelled huts, refuges for the prehistoric inhabitants of the region, occur in various locations about the city.

In addition, fossils and San rock art are present in the region.

==Coat of arms==
By 1931, the Kroonstad municipal council had assumed a coat of arms. It was registered with the Orange Free State Provincial Administration in February 1967 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in April 1971.

The arms were: &quot;Or, a tree on an island proper; on a chief Argent fimbriated Azure, a locomotive and tender Sable&quot; (&quot;a golden shield displaying a tree on a grassy base, below a black locomotive and tender on a silver stripe across the top of the shield&quot;). Originally, an imperial crown was placed above the shield, but it was replaced with a golden mural crown in the 1960s. The supporters were a black wildebeest and a blesbok, and the motto was &quot;&quot;.

==Sister cities==

Kroonstad has two sister cities whose names are reminiscent of its own:

* – Braşov (), a city in Romania
* – Kronstadt, a Russian seaport city west of Saint Petersburg

<doc id="1269804" wikidata="Q6293393" url="?curid=1269804" title="José Bustani">
<text>José Maurício de Figueiredo Bustani (born June 5, 1945) is a Brazilian diplomat who was the first director-general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons until he was ousted after pressure from the US government in April 2002 over disagreements about how to address Iraq&#x27;s alleged weapons of mass destruction.

== Career ==
Born in Porto Velho, Rondônia, he received his law degree from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in 1967, and attended the Rio Branco Institute in the same year, after which he joined the Brazilian Foreign Service. He was the ambassador of Brazil in several countries, including the United Kingdom, between 2003 and 2008, and France, from 2008 up to retiring in 2015.

==Director General of the OPCW==
Bustani was appointed the first director general of the OPCW in 1997. His four-year term was due to expire in 2001. However, he was unanimously reelected to this position one year early, in May 2000 for a term of four years.

===Removal from Office===
Soon after, Bustani fell out of favour with the U.S., who began to lobby aggressively for his removal, in a campaign orchestrated by U.S. official John Bolton. Finally, at Bolton&#x27;s behest, a special meeting was held in The Hague on April 21, 2002. Following what are reputed to have been both secretive and tempestuous deliberations, a vote was held, with Bustani&#x27;s removal being carried by a vote of 48–7, with 43 abstentions. This is thought to be the first time in history that the head of a major international organisation was removed during his or her term of office, and the most bitter public campaign by the United States to force a senior international official from office since the Clinton administration blocked the 1996 reelection of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali.

There is much controversy surrounding the reasons behind Bustani&#x27;s removal. He had been negotiating with the Iraqi government, and was hoping to persuade them to sign up to the OPCW, thus granting OPCW inspectors full access to Iraq&#x27;s purported &quot;chemical weapons arsenal&quot;. If Bustani had succeeded, this would have placed an extremely uncomfortable obstacle in the path of the Bush administration&#x27;s war plans, by removing their ostensible motive. While Bustani&#x27;s supporters insist this was the reason why the US forced him out the Bush administration claimed that Bustani&#x27;s position was no longer tenable, stating three main reasons: &quot;polarizing and confrontational conduct&quot;, &quot;mismanagement issues&quot; and &quot;advocacy of inappropriate roles for the OPCW&quot;. Bolton&#x27;s claims of mismanagement were later dismissed by a tribunal.

Bustani&#x27;s supporters also claim that the U.S. ambassador John Bolton issued threats against OPCW - including the withdrawal of U.S. support for the organization - in order to coerce the member states to support the U.S. initiative against Bustani. Bustani stated that, when he refused to resign prior to the 2003 Iraq War, he was bullied and threatened by Bolton, who told him &quot;You have 24 hours to leave the organization, and if you don&#x27;t comply with this decision by Washington, we have ways to retaliate against you. ... We know where your kids live. You have two sons in New York&quot;. Bustani&#x27;s statement appears to be consistent with what was said about Bolton&#x27;s practices during the U.S. Senate hearings prior to his appointment as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Bustani filed a complaint with the International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal, which found that he had been unlawfully dismissed and set aside the dismissal decision. He was awarded compensation for both material and moral damages, as well as costs. In their judgment the tribunal condemned &quot;political interference by member states&quot; in the workings of the OPCW. Bustani did not seek reinstatement. According to the Statement of the Delegation of Brazil, on the IX Conference of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention on 3 December 2004, Bustani donated 100% of his compensation for moral damages (&quot;an amount which exceeds Euro 50,000.00&quot;) to the International Cooperation programmes of the OPCW: &quot;A letter of Ambassador Bustani regarding this donation and comments about the final Judgement of the ILOAT on the issue of his removal can be found in a National Paper distributed by Brazil, document C-9/NAT.1, dated 13 August 2004.&quot;

== Nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize ==
In 2003, Bustani was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his achievements at the OPCW. For many, this nomination represented the acknowledgement of his commitment to the neutrality, independence and emphasis on the multilateral character of the organization as well as the non-discriminatory treatment of member states. However he did not receive the prize. Ten years after, in 2013, the OPCW, as an organization, won the Nobel Peace Prize. The OPCW Director-General recognised the contributions of former staff members of the Preparatory Commission and the Technical Secretariat by giving them a certificate marking the historic achievement.

== Douma Chemical Attack ==
In October 2019, Bustani was part of a Courage Foundation panel which heard a presentation from one of the OPCW whistleblowers related to the Douma chemical attack. Bustani wrote that &quot;The convincing evidence of irregular behaviour in the OPCW investigation of the alleged Douma chemical attack confirms doubts and suspicions I already had&quot;. In November 2019, he signed a letter asking the OPCW to &quot;permit all inspectors who took part in the Douma investigation to come forward and report their differing observations in an appropriate forum&quot;.

In October 2020, Bustani was scheduled to testify at the United Nations Security Council about the alleged cover up by the OPCW regarding the Douma chemical attack. The United States, Britain and France blocked Bustani from testifying on the grounds that Bustani left the OPCW in 2002 and thus was not involved in the issues being discussed. The representative of the Russian Federation read out the statement Bustani would have delivered. According to Democracy Now, Bustani had intended asking the OPCW to look into statements by some of its inspectors who have questioned the official OPCW findings into the chemical attack and have stated that the OPCW engaged in &quot;evidence suppression, selective use of data and exclusion of key investigators&quot; when making its report.

<text>The Sognefjord Spans are the second, third, and fourth longest spans in the world situated east of Hermansverk, Norway and are part of different powerlines. As Sognefjord Span is a deep valley the pylons of these spans are not taller than ordinary pylons. In order to avoid any too close approaches or contacts between the conductors, each is mounted on a separate pylon at the end of the span, which is built as a steel framework tower.

== Span 1 ==
This span is part of the powerline between Hermansverk and Vikøyri and was built in the 1950s. It has a length of 4850 metres and was until the inauguration of Ameralik Span the longest span in the world. The span, which crosses Sognefjord in North-South direction, has 4 conductors, whereby one is for reserve. Its northern ends are at&lt;br&gt;

== Span 2 ==
Just a few hundred meters east of Span 1, the powerline between Sogndal and Hove substations crosses Sognefjord with a 4520 meters long spanning East-West direction. As Span 1 it has 4 conductors, whereby 1 is as reserve.&lt;br&gt;
The locations of the towers used for this span are at its western end: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

== Span 3 ==
Approximately 9 kilometres east-south east of these spans, there crosses the line from Aurland1 to Langedøla Sognefjord in a span with a length of 4500 metres in North-South direction. It has no reserve conductor and consists therefore of 3 ropes. Its towers are situated at its southern end at&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

<doc id="1269814" wikidata="Q1156915" url="?curid=1269814" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō">
<text>was a of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). She was laid down as the passenger liner , but was purchased by the IJN in 1941 while still under construction and converted into an aircraft carrier. Completed in May 1942, the ship participated in the Aleutian Islands Campaign the following month and in several battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign later in the year. Her aircraft were used from land bases during several battles in the New Guinea and Solomon Islands Campaigns.

&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was torpedoed in November 1943 and spent three months under repair. Several bombs damaged her during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944, but quickly returned to service. Lacking aircraft, she was used as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was under repair until March 1945, when work was canceled as uneconomical. She was then effectively hulked for the rest of the war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans also decided that she was not worth the cost to make her serviceable for use as a repatriation ship, and she was broken up in 1946–1947.

==Design and description==
The ship was ordered in late 1938 as the fast luxury passenger liner &quot;Kashiwara Maru&quot; by &quot;Nippon Yusen Kaisha&quot; (the Japan Mail Steamship Company). In exchange for a 60 percent subsidy of her building costs by the Navy Ministry, she was designed to be converted to an auxiliary aircraft carrier, one of 10 such ships subsidized by the IJN.

&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard load. Her crew ranged from 1,187 to 1,224 officers and men. The ship was fitted with two Mitsubishi-Curtis geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by six Mitsubishi three-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; had a designed speed of , but reached during her sea trials. The ship carried of fuel oil, which gave her a range of at .

===Flight deck arrangements===

&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars, each approximately long, wide and high. Each hangar could be subdivided by four fire curtains and they were fitted with fire fighting foam dispensers on each side. Two aircraft elevators served the hangars.

The ship&#x27;s air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M (&quot;Claude&quot;) fighters, plus 4 in storage, 18 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, plus 2 in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers. This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters with 3 more in storage for the A5Ms by the time the ship was commissioned in 1942. As a result of the lessons learned from the Battle of Midway in June, the ship&#x27;s fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros, and the B5Ns were reduced to 9. By the end of the year, 6 more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As, giving totals of 27 A6Ms, 12 D3As, and 9 B5Ns. Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, 8 or 9 were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.

===Armor, armament and sensors===
As a conversion from an ocean liner, the ship could not support much armor, although it had a double bottom. Two plates of Ducol steel, each thick, protecting the sides of the ship&#x27;s machinery spaces. The ship&#x27;s aviation gasoline tanks and magazines were protected by one layer of Ducol steel. Her machinery spaces were further subdivided by transverse and longitudinal bulkheads to limit any flooding.

The ship&#x27;s primary armament consisted of a dozen 40-caliber Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in six twin-gun mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was also initially equipped with eight triple mounts for 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns alongside the flight deck. In mid-1943, four more triple mounts were added, and another four triple mounts in late 1943 and early 1944. Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island. A dozen single mounts were also added, some of which were portable and could be mounted on the flight deck. After the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with three more triple mounts, two twin mounts, and eighteen single mounts for the 25 mm Type 96 gun. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. In October 1944, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; had a total of 91 Type 96 guns: 57 in nineteen triple mounts, 4 in two twin mounts, and 30 single mounts.

Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control directors, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a rangefinder. When &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was first commissioned only the rangefinders were fitted and the directors were added later. Four Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and another pair was added in early 1943. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 early-warning radars. The first of these was mounted on the top of the island in July 1942, shortly after she was completed, and the other was added later in the year on the port side of the hull, outboard of the rear elevator. A smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 early-warning radar was added in 1944.

==Career==
&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s keel was laid down by Mitsubishi on Slipway No. 3 at their shipyard in Nagasaki on 20 March 1939. She was yard number 900 and had the name &quot;Kashiwara Maru&quot; at that time. The ship was purchased on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry and she was temporarily referred to as No. 1001 Ship (&quot;Dai 1001 bankan&quot;) to keep her conversion secret. She was launched on 26 June 1941 and commissioned on 3 May 1942 as &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;.

Upon commissioning, the ship was assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while the main body of the American fleet was occupied defending Midway. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros and a dozen D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters that shot down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to make it back to the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft was launched, the Americans attacked the carriers but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.

&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; had initially been designated as an auxiliary aircraft carrier (&quot;Tokusetsu kokubokan&quot;), but following the loss of four Japanese fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, she was redesignated as a regular carrier (&quot;Kokubokan&quot;) in July. Captain Okada Tametsugu assumed command on 20 July 1942. Upon arrival at Truk on 9 October, together with her sister ship , the ship was assigned to the Second Carrier Division to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the 3rd Fleet.

On the night of 16 October, the two carriers were ordered to attack the American transports off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal and they moved south to their launching point north of Lunga. At 05:15 each ship launched nine each A6M Zeros and B5Ns (one of &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s B5Ns was forced to turn back with mechanical problems) which reached the target and discovered two destroyers bombarding Japanese supply dumps on Guadalcanal around 07:20. &quot;Hiyō&quot;″s aircraft attacked seven minutes later without effect, although the American ship shot down one B5N and damaged another which was forced to make a crash landing. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s eight B5Ns engaged and also failed to hit their target, not least because they were attacked by Marine Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters at 07:32. The Marine pilots shot down three B5Ns on their first pass and severely damaged another pair which were also forced to crash land. They then shot down the three remaining bombers after they missed &quot;Lardner&quot;. The defending Zeros were only able to shoot down one Wildcat at the cost of one of &quot;Hiyō&quot;″s fighters forced to crash land, although they claimed to have shot down thirteen Marine fighters. &quot;Hiyō&quot; was forced to depart the area after a fire reduced her top speed to and transferred three Zeros, one D3A and five B5Ns before she left. Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, commander of the Second Carrier Division, also transferred and hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;.
In late October 1942, during the Guadalcanal Campaign, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. At this time, her air group consisted of eighteen Zeros, eighteen D3As, and nine B5Ns. At 05:00 on 26 October 1942, she had launched fourteen Zeros and a few D3As to land at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, which had been falsely reported by the Imperial Japanese Army as in their hands, but they were greeted by Marine Grumman F4F Wildcats and all were shot down. At 09:30, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; launched another air strike that attacked the carrier , the battleship and the light cruiser , scoring hits on the latter two, but inflicting little substantial damage. Three D3As and a B5N were shot down by returning Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers. Kakuta ordered another air strike to be launched at 14:15, using six B5Ns from the damaged and nine D3As from both carriers. Shortly afterward, more aircraft were launched to attack the American ships, including six B5Ns and six D3As escorted by half a dozen Zeros. All of these aircraft attacked the carrier , which had been badly damaged by the attacks earlier in the day. American damage control measures had been partially successful, but one torpedo hit by a B5N from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; increased her list from 7.5° to 14.5° and near-misses by the dive bombers started enough seams in her plating that her list increased to 18°. The Americans finally ordered the ship abandoned and the last wave of dive bombers hit &quot;Hornet&quot; twice more, but inflicted little further damage.

In mid-November 1942, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was tasked to provide air cover for the convoy bringing reinforcements for the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal during the three-day-long Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The ship had twenty-seven A6M3 Zeros, a dozen D3A2s, and nine B5N2s for this task. Six of her Zeros were on Combat Air Patrol when the convoy was discovered by two SBDs from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and shot down one dive bomber after it had made its spot report. They were unable to protect the convoy against further attacks by aircraft based at Henderson Field; seven transports were sunk and the remaining four transports were damaged before the end of the day. That afternoon, &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been discovered by a searching B5N, and &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; launched an air strike with her remaining aircraft, but they failed to locate the American carrier. In December 1942 and January 1943, the carrier covered several convoys that brought reinforcements to Wewak, New Guinea, and her air group protected the forces there for several days before returning to Truk on 20 January. The ship then covered the evacuation from Guadalcanal through early February.

&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; briefly returned to Japan in February before she sailed for Truk on 22 March together with &quot;Hiyō&quot;. Her air group was detached to Rabaul on 2 April to participate in Operation I-Go, a land-based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. Before returning to Truk in the middle of the month, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s aircraft claimed to have shot down sixteen American aircraft for the loss of seven A6Ms and two D3As, and they sank the destroyer . The ship&#x27;s air group was deployed to Buin, Papua New Guinea, on 2 July in response to the American attack on Rendova Island on 30 June. Her fighters claimed 37 victories for the loss of nine aircraft before disbanding on 1 September. Leaving her aircraft behind, the carrier returned to Japan in late July.

&quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; ferried aircraft to Sumatra in mid-August and troops and equipment to the Caroline Islands in September and October. En route from Truk to Kure on 5 November 1943, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was hit off Bungo Suidō by a torpedo from the submarine . Four men were killed, but the damage was light, other than the disabled rudder. The ship was under repair and refit until 29 February 1944 at Kure. Meanwhile, her air group had been reconstituted at Singapore on 1 November with 24 Zeros, 18 D3As and 9 B5Ns. The aircraft transferred to Truk on 1 December and then to Kavieng at the end of December before reaching Rabaul on 25 January 1944. Her fighters claimed 40 Allied aircraft were shot down and another 30 probably destroyed, but the air group was virtually annihilated. The survivors were back at Truk on 20 February and the air group was disbanded.

In the meantime, the Japanese Navy had restructured its carrier air groups so that one air group was assigned to one carrier division, and the 652nd Naval Air Group was assigned to the 2nd Carrier Division with &quot;Hiyō&quot;, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; and &quot;Ryūhō&quot; on 1 March. The air group was last in priority to be rebuilt and only had 30 Model 21 Zeros, 13 Model 52 Zeros, and four D3As on hand on 1 April of its authorized 81 fighters, 36 dive bombers, and 27 torpedo bombers. The ship conducted training for her aircraft in the Inland Sea until 11 May, when she sailed for Tawi-Tawi in the Philippines. The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands, where the Japanese expected the next American attack. However, the location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots, and American submarine activity restricted the ships to the anchorage.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===

The Japanese fleet was en route to Guimares Island in the central Philippines on 13 June, where they intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa learned of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day. Upon reaching Guimares, the fleet refueled and sortied into the Philippine Sea, where they spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June. The Americans failed to locate Ozawa&#x27;s ships that day and the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers as Ozawa had decided to launch his air strikes early the following morning. At this time, the 652nd Naval Air Group consisted of 81 Zeros, 27 D3As, 9 Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bombers, and 18 Nakajima B6N &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers, roughly evenly divided among the three ships. The three carriers began launching their first air strike of 26 bomb-carrying A6M2 Zeros, 16 A6M5 Zeros to escort the other aircraft and 7 B6Ns at about 09:30. Most of these aircraft were misdirected and failed to find any American ships, although a dozen persisted in their search and found one of the American task groups. A B6N, 5 bomb-carrying Zeros, and an escorting Zero were shot down by the defending fighters and no damage was inflicted on any American ships.

A second air strike of 27 D3As, 9 D4Ys, 2 B6Ns, and 26 escorting Zeros was launched around 11:00, accompanied by at least 18 A6Ms and B6Ns from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and . They had also been given an erroneous spot report and could not find any American ships. The 652nd aircraft headed for the airfield at Rota and Guam to refuel while those from the other two carriers returned to them. A pair of Zeros and 6 D4Ys bound for Rota spotted the carriers and en route, but failed to inflict any damage on the American ships while losing 5 D4Ys to anti-aircraft fire. Radar had spotted those aircraft headed for Guam and they were intercepted by 41 Grumman F6F Hellcats. Only a single A6M5, 1 D4Y, and 7 D3As of the 49 Japanese aircraft survived the encounter and landed.
At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the northwest to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon of the following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched. They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. The 652nd Naval Air Group claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to ditch. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.

After repairs at Kure, &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; remained in the Inland Sea without aircraft until 27 October, when she was tasked to transport material to Borneo. On 3 November, she was attacked by the submarine near Makung, but her escorting destroyer, , deliberately intercepted the torpedoes and sank with no survivors. On her return voyage, the ship was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarines and . On 25 November, she sailed for Manila via Makung to rendezvous with the battleship and the destroyers &quot;Suzutsuki&quot;, &quot;Fuyutsuki&quot;, and &quot;Maki&quot;. Having loaded 200 survivors of the battleship , &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was attacked by the submarines , and early in the morning of 9 December 1944. She was hit by three torpedoes that flooded several compartments and killed 19 men. These gave her a 10°–12° list to starboard, but she was able to proceed on one engine. She reached Sasebo the following day and began repairs on 18 December.

The repairs were abandoned in March 1945 for lack of materials and the ship was moved from the dock to Ebisu Bay, Sasebo, on 1 April. Efforts to camouflage the ship began on 23 April and she was reclassified as a guard ship on 20 June. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot;″s armament was ordered removed on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the Allies on 2 September. An American technical team evaluated the ship&#x27;s condition on 8 October and deemed her a constructive total loss. &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.

<text>The Ameralik Span is the longest span of an electrical overhead power line in the world. It is situated near Nuuk on Greenland and crosses Ameralik fjord with a span width of at . It was built in 1993 by the Norwegian company NTE Entreprise (Nord-Trøndelag Elektrisitetsverk) and is part of a single-circuit 132 kV powerline running from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant to Nuuk.

The span consists of four 40-millimeter diameter steel conductors, one of which is a spare. The span has a width of 190 metres and a minimum clearance of 128 metres. The pylons on each side of the span carry only one conductor each and are situated on mountains 444 metres high on the north shore and 1,013 metres high on the south shore. It is designed to withstand the cold winters of Greenland, so electricity produced can reach consumers without any disturbance.

<text>The Tamur River is a major river in eastern Nepal, which begins around Kanchenjunga. The Tamor and the Arun join the Sun Koshi at Tribenighat to form the giant Saptakoshi which flows through Mahabharat Range on to the Gangetic plain.

==Koshi river system==
The Koshi or Sapta Koshi drains eastern Nepal. It has been known as Sapta Koshi because of the seven rivers which join in east-central Nepal to form this river. The main rivers forming the Koshi system are – the Sun Koshi, the Indravati River, the Bhote Koshi, the Dudh Koshi, Arun River, Barun River, and Tamur River. The combined river flows through the Chatra Gorge in a southerly direction to emerge from the hills.

<text>Wied&#x27;s marmoset (Callithrix kuhlii), also known as Wied&#x27;s black-tufted-ear marmoset, is a New World monkey that lives in tropical and subtropical forests of eastern Brazil. Unlike other marmosets, Wied&#x27;s marmoset lives in groups consisting of 4 or 5 females and 2 or 3 males (plus children). They are matriarchal, and only the dominant female is allowed to mate. Like other marmosets, the offspring are always born in pairs.

==Diet==

This monkey supplements its diet of sap with fruit, nectar, flowers and seeds, as well as spiders and insects. Since these are harvested from the middle and lower part of the forest, Wied&#x27;s marmoset often travels and forages in the company of the golden-headed lion tamarin, which forages in the canopy.

==Natural Predators==

Wied&#x27;s marmoset is eaten by birds of prey (the harpy eagle, the gray hawk, the roadside hawk and the white-tailed hawk), felines (the jaguar, jaguarundi and ocelot) and snakes.

==Behavior==

Wied&#x27;s marmoset is highly social, spending much of its time grooming. It has individually distinctive calls, and it communicates through gestures and olfactory markings as well.

==Appearance==

The coloring of Wied&#x27;s marmoset is mostly black, with white markings on cheeks and forehead. It has rings on its tail and black tufts of fur coming out of its ears.

==Chimerism==

Chimeric individuals carry two or more genetic cell lines in their bodies, each of which stems from a separate and genetically distinct zygote. This chimerism is the result of cell lines exchanged between siblings in utero. These two original zygotes were fertilized by two different sperm, which potentially came from more than one male. Therefore, chimeric individuals exhibit a phenotype that is the result of more than one genotype, and potentially more than one father.

Researchers first discovered chimerism in the bone marrow of marmosets in the 1960s. More recent work has shown that chimerism can occur in all cell lines, including germ cells. This allows for the possibility of horizontal inheritance. In other words, individuals could pass on the genotype that is different from their majority (or self) genotype. Consider a father marmoset was chimeric in his germ line. This father could potentially pass on his secondary cell line (the majority or self cell line of his brother) to his offspring. In this way, this father&#x27;s offspring would be more genetically similar to their uncle than to their father.

Since chimerism changes the degrees of relatedness between individuals, it also changes the adaptive value of certain behaviors, like cooperatively raising young. It has been proposed that chimerism creates a system that makes it evolutionarily advantageous for an individual to cooperate to raise its siblings; this closely matches to the way marmoset social systems have been observed to function in the wild.

<doc id="1269822" wikidata="Q7711775" url="?curid=1269822" title="The 1900 House">
<text>The 1900 House is a historical reenactment reality television series made by Wall to Wall/Channel 4 in 1999. The programme features a modern family attempting to live in the way of the late Victorians for three months in a modified house. It was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and PBS in America (with American commentary).

The series was accompanied by the book &quot;1900 House: Featuring Extracts from the Personal Diaries of Joyce and Paul Bowler and Their Family&quot; by Mark McCrum and Matthew Sturgis. It won a Peabody Award in 2000 for being &quot;an often humorous, always perceptive, series about the realities of life in 1900 that reveals themes of perseverance, human adaptation and family dynamics.&quot;

== The house ==
The 1900 House in question is 50 Elliscombe Road, Charlton, South-East London (). An 1890s-built two-storey terraced house with a drawing room, a dining room, a kitchen, a scullery, a bathroom, three bedrooms (there were actually four, but one was used as a safety room with a telephone) and an outside loo. To make it the 1900 house, all modern elements were removed, including electricity, insulation, indoor toilet, and central heating. Period fixtures such as a &#x27;copper&#x27; (a large pot used for heating washing clothes over a fire), cast-iron oven and fireplaces were installed. Gas lighting was reinstalled using original remaining pipes.

== The Bowler family ==
* Paul was the father of the family. In contemporary life, he was a Warrant Officer in the Royal Marines. In the house, he worked in the recruiting office in London (for two months; after that, he had to go to his regular job in the Marines). He felt that the role of &quot;Man of the House&quot; was difficult to act. 
* Joyce was the mother of the family. In her normal life, she was a civil servant for Somerset Social Services. She looked after the family and later in her free time she looked at the growing suffragette movement. She had problems with her hair (shampoo hadn&#x27;t yet been invented in 1900) and difficulty with incorporating her vegetarian diet into the project.
* Kathryn was a 16-year-old performing-arts student. In the house, she missed modern cleanliness, her friends and her social life. 
* Ruth and Hilary were 11-year-old twins. In the house, they missed their friends and their music.
* Joe was a 9-year-old boy. In the house, he missed sweets and fast-food.

== Other people ==

Daru Rooke was the consultant historian to the series who helped the family adjust to the 1900 lifestyle. He later visited the house for a dinner party with the family. He also equipped the family with a useful reference manual to aid their stay at the house, based on sources of the period such as &quot;Mrs. Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; and &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Household Guide&quot;.

Because looking after the house became difficult, the Bowlers decided to hire a maid-of-all-work. Elizabeth Lillington was chosen, however after a few weeks the family sacked her as Joyce decided that she could not reconcile her views on women&#x27;s emancipation with employing a woman as a domestic. However, being &#x27;liberated&#x27; was not the view Elizabeth herself took of her dismissal. It was pointed out that a woman in Elizabeth&#x27;s position in 1900 would have faced desperate poverty had she been denied housekeeping work.

<text>STEP-file is a widely used data exchange form of STEP. ISO 10303 can represent 3D objects in computer-aided design (CAD) and related information. A STEP-file is ASCII text with the format defined in ISO 10303-21 &quot;Clear Text Encoding of the Exchange Structure&quot;.

ISO 10303-21 defines the encoding mechanism for representing data conforming to a particular schema in the EXPRESS data modeling language specified in ISO 10303-11. A STEP-File is also called &quot;p21-File&quot; and &quot;STEP Physical File&quot;. The file extensions &quot;.stp&quot; and &quot;.step&quot; indicate that the file contains data conforming to STEP application protocols while the extension &quot;.p21&quot; should be used for all other purposes.

The use of ISO 10303-21 is not limited to STEP. The Industry Foundation Classes and earlier CIMSteel Integration Standard (CIS/2) define an EXPRESS schema for building information modeling data and specify ISO 10303-21 as an exchange encoding.

== Example ==

This graph shows the entity instances and the references between them in a file representing a solid model of a cylinder.

== History ==
Some details to take note of:
* The first edition, ISO 10303-21:1994, had some bugs, which were corrected by a Technical Corrigendum. Therefore, it is recommended that users study the second edition instead (see below).
* The second edition, ISO 10303-21:2002, included the corrigendum and extensions for several data sections.
* The third edition, ISO 10303-21:2016, added anchor, reference and signature sections to support external references, support for compressed exchange structures in a ZIP-based archive, digital signatures, and UTF-8 character encoding.
* Part 21 defined two conformance classes. They differ only in how to encode complex entity instances.
** Conformance class 1 is always used enforce the so-called &quot;internal mapping&quot;, which is more compact.
** Conformance class 2, which is not used in practice, always enforces the &quot;external mapping&quot;. In theory this would allow better AP interoperability, since a post-processor may know how to handle some supertypes, but may not know the specified subtypes.
* The 1st edition of part 21 enforces the use of so-called &quot;short names&quot;, which are optional in the 2nd edition. In practice, however, &quot;short names&quot; are rarely used.
* The 2nd edition allows multiple data sections to be used. In practice, however, most implementations only use a single data section (1st edition encoding).

===HEADER section===
As seen in the above example, the file is split into two sections following the initial keyword &quot;ISO-10303-21;&quot;:

The &quot;HEADER section&quot; has a fixed structure consisting of 3 to 6 groups in the given order. Except for the data fields &quot;time_stamp&quot; and &quot;FILE_SCHEMA&quot; all fields may contain empty strings.
* FILE_DESCRIPTION
** &quot;description&quot;. A brief description of the contents of the file.
** &quot;implementation_level&quot;. The version and conformance option of this file. Possible versions are &quot;1&quot; for the original standard back in 1994, &quot;2&quot; for the technical corrigendum in 1995 and &quot;3&quot; for the second edition. The conformance option is either &quot;1&quot; for internal and &quot;2&quot; for external mapping of complex entity instances. Often, one will find here the value __&#x27;2;1&#x27;__. The value &#x27;2;2&#x27; enforcing external mapping is also possible but only very rarely used. The values &#x27;3;1&#x27; and &#x27;3;2&#x27; indicate extended STEP-Files as defined in the 2001 standard with several DATA sections, multiple schemas and FILE_POPULATION support.
* FILE_NAME
** &quot;name&quot; of this exchange structure. It may correspond to the name of the file in a file system or reflect data in this file. There is no strict rule how to use this field.
** &quot;time_stamp&quot; indicates the time when this file was created. The time is given in the international data time format ISO 8601, e.g. &quot;2003-12-27T11:57:53&quot; for 27 of December 2003, 2 minutes to noon time.
** &quot;author&quot; the name and mailing address of the person creating this exchange structure
** &quot;organization&quot; the organization to whom the person belongs to
** &quot;preprocessor_version&quot; the name of the system and its version which produces this STEP-file
** &quot;originating_system&quot; the name of the system and its version which originally created the information contained in this STEP-file.
** &quot;authorization&quot; the name and mailing address of the person who authorized this file.
* FILE_SCHEMA. Specifies one or several Express schema governing the information in the data section(s). For first edition files, only one EXPRESS schema together with an optional ASN.1 object identifier of the schema version can be listed here. Second edition files may specify several EXPRESS schema.
The last three header groups are only valid in second edition files.
* FILE_POPULATION, indicating a valid population (set of entity instances) which conforms to an EXPRESS schemas. This is done by collecting data from several data_sections and referenced instances from other data sections.
** &quot;governing_schema&quot;, the EXPRESS schema to which the indicated population belongs to and by which it can be validated.
** &quot;determination_method&quot; to figure out which instances belong to the population. Three methods are predefined: SECTION_BOUNDARY, INCLUDE_ALL_COMPATIBLE, and INCLUDE_REFERENCED.
** &quot;governed_sections&quot;, the data sections whose entity instances fully belongs to the population.
** The concept of FILE_POPULATION is very close to schema_instance of SDAI. Unfortunately, during the standardization process, it was not possible to come to an agreement to merge these concepts. Therefore, JSDAI adds further attributes to FILE_POPULATION as intelligent comments to cover all missing information from schema_instance. This is supported for both import and export.
* SECTION_LANGUAGE allows assignment of a default language for either all or a specific data section. This is needed for those Express schemas that do not provide the capability to specify in which language string attributes of entities such as name and description are given.
* SECTION_CONTEXT provide the capability to specify additional context information for all or single data sections. This can be used e.g. for STEP-APs to indicate which conformance class is covered by a particular data section.

=== DATA section ===
The DATA section contains application data according to one specific express schema. The encoding of this data follows some simple principles.
* Instance name: Every entity instance in the exchange structure is given a unique name in the form &quot;#1234&quot;. The instance name must consist of a positive number (&gt;0) and is typically smaller than 263. The instance name is only valid locally within the STEP-file. If the same content is exported again from a system the instance names may be different for the same instances. The instance name is also used to reference other entity instances through attribute values or aggregate members. The referenced instance may be defined before or after the current instance.
* Instances of single entity data types are represented by writing the name of the entity in capital letters and then followed by the attribute values in the defined order within parentheses. See e.g. &quot;#16=PRODUCT(...)&quot; above.
* Instances of complex entity data types are represented in the STEP file by using either the internal mapping or the external mapping.
** External mapping has always to be used if the complex entity instance consist of more than one leaf entity. In this case all the single entity instance values are given independently from each other in alphabetical order as defined above with all entity values grouped together in parentheses.
** Internal mapping is used by default for conformance option 1 when the complex entity instance consists of only one leaf entity. The encoding is similar to the one of a single entity instance with the additional order given by the subtype definition.
* Mapping of attribute values:
** Only explicit attributes get mapped. Inverse, derived and re-declared attributes are not listed since their values can be deduced from the other ones.
** Unset attribute values are given as &quot;$&quot;.
** Explicit attributes which got re-declared as derived in a subtype are encoded as &quot;*&quot; in the position of the supertype attribute.
* Mapping of other data types:
** Enumeration, Boolean and logical values are given in capital letters with a leading and trailing dot such as &quot;.TRUE.&quot;.
** String values are given in . For characters with a code greater than 126 a special encoding is used. The character sets as defined in ISO 8859 and 10646 are supported. Note that typical 8 (e.g. west European) or 16 (Unicode) bit character sets cannot directly be taken for STEP-file strings. They have to be decoded in a very special way.
** Integers and real values are used identical to typical programming languages
** Binary values (bit sequences) are encoded as hexadecimal and surrounded by double quotes, with a leading character indicating the number of unused bits (0, 1, 2, or 3) followed by uppercase hexadecimal encoding of data. It is important to note that the entire binary value is encoded as a single hexadecimal number, with the highest order bits in the first hex character and the lowest order bits in the last one.
** The elements of aggregates (SET, BAG, LIST, ARRAY) are given in parentheses, separated by &quot;,&quot;.
** Care has to be taken for select data types based on defined data types. Here the name of the defined data type gets mapped too.
* See also &quot;Mapping of Express to Java&quot; for more details of this.

==Criticism==
Possibly the only advantage of STEP files is that they are widely adopted in many CAD software. On the other hand, its format, and specially the EXPRESS data modelling language has a few disadvantages:
* the specification is not freely available (you have to pay for it)
* it is not possible to sequentially read a STEP file. Entities can be in any order and can reference other entities forwards and backwards in the file (see entity #14 in the example above). Therefore the entire file has to be read into memory and tokenized before parsing.
* the format is not storage-efficient. For example assigning an RGB color code to an edge requires at least 6 other entities, and specifying a transformation requires at least 5 additional entities (PLANE, AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D, a CARTESIAN_POINT, and 2 DIRECTION entities)
* the format is not well-defined. For example the same triangle can be encoded in a STEP file in many different ways (with FACET_BREP, ADVANCED_FACE, POLY_LOOP, EDGE_LOOP, as a MANIFOLD_SOLID_REPRESENTATION or as a SHELL_BASED_REPRESENTATION, etc.). An importer needs to recognize all variants in order to read a STEP file consistently. Most CAD software does not support the full set of STEP entries, and as such, are limited to a specific subset of STEP entities. For example Autodesk Knowledge Base, list of supported STEP entities.
* As a result, most CAD software have some sort of &quot;repair geometry data after import&quot; feature, which may or may not work.

<doc id="1269828" wikidata="Q2521439" url="?curid=1269828" title="Caratacus' last battle">
<text>The final battle in Caratacus&#x27; resistance to Roman rule was fought in 50 AD. The Romans under Publius Ostorius Scapula defeated the Britons and in the aftermath captured Caratacus himself, since 43 the leader of armed opposition to the Roman conquest of Britain. He was paraded through Rome and given the opportunity to make a speech before the emperor Claudius, who spared his life and those of his family and retainers.

==Prelude==
Tacitus outlines the campaigns leading up to the battle: 

==Location==

Tacitus&#x27; account limits the location to the territory of the Ordovices, whose boundaries are no longer known. It included a large area of what is now central and northern Wales. He gives several details, which limit, but do not conclusively identify, the site of the battle: His topographical details thus include an un-named river, fordable in some stretches, tactically close to high hills offering inaccessible slopes and many loose rocks, possibly scree, but also some paths up with gentler gradients, which trained men could climb while closely packed together in testudo formation.

Various sites have been claimed by local legends, though no suggested location has achieved academic plausibility nor fulfilled all of Tacitus&#x27; elements. Tacitus does not name the river, but some local historians have supposed that it is the Severn. The hill fort on Caer Caradoc Hill in Shropshire is connected with the battle by virtue of its name. Local legend places it at British Camp in the Malvern Hills. However, the Severn, though visible from the Malvern Hills, is too distant to fit Tacitus&#x27;s description of the site, and the Severn is not visible from Caer Caradoc Hill. A position just west of Caersws, Cefn Carnedd where the remains of earthworks still stand, has also been suggested.

==Pre-battle speeches==
On this occasion Tacitus does not follow the common practice of inventing the specific words spoken by the leaders or men. On the British side he reports: 

Facing a strong position full of aroused fighting men, Ostorius was not keen on a frontal assault. Tacitus reports: 

The Roman troops, who had by this point been trudging around Wales after Caratacus for some years, were eager for a decisive fight. 

==Battle==
Ostorius took note of the paths up the slopes facing his men. He launched his men over the fordable sections of the river. The Roman soldiers came under a rain of missiles, but employed the testudo formation to protect themselves and dismantled the stone ramparts. Once inside the defences, the Romans broke through in bloody fighting. The Britons withdrew to the hilltops, but the Romans kept up the attack by both auxiliaries and legionaries. The Britons were generally without body armour or helmets and they broke and fled; the Roman troops then closely pursued the fugitives. Tacitus reports: 

==Aftermath==
Tacitus writes: 

Caratacus himself escaped. He fled north, seeking refuge among the Brigantes. The Brigantian queen, Cartimandua, depended on Rome for her personal position, and she handed him over to the Romans in chains. Tacitus reports: 

==Display in Rome==
The name and fame of Caratacus were now known far outside the army of Britain, and he and his family were central attractions in the triumphal parade through the streets of Rome before the Emperor Claudius himself. (After the fall of the Roman Republic, triumphs were celebrated in the name of the reigning emperor.) Caratacus&#x27; defeat was publicly likened by the Senators to some of Rome&#x27;s greatest victories, and Ostorius Scapula was awarded triumphal ornaments for defeating him.

The normal practice would have been for the prisoners to be executed at the end of the triumphal ceremony. Caratacus gave a speech which persuaded Claudius to spare him and his family. 

Tacitus would have been a small child at this time, but he reports Caratacus&#x27; words as if he had been taking contemporaneous notes: 

After his liberation, according to Dio Cassius, Caratacus was impressed by the city of Rome:

<doc id="1269829" wikidata="Q668851" url="?curid=1269829" title="Phungling Municipality">
<text>Phungling Municipality (previously also &quot;Taplejung Municipality&quot;) is a municipality located in Taplejung District in the Koshi Province of Nepal. 
The municipality was formed merging the then two Village Development Committees of Phungling and Dokhu in May 2014. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 19,085 people and 4,480 individual households.

==Background==
Phungling was a Village Development Committee along with other 49 VDCs in Taplejung District before 2014. At the time of 2011 Nepal census, it had total population of 14,974 individuals and 3571 households. On 8 May 2014, Government of Nepal announced 72 new municipalities. The government merged 283 VDCs to create 72 new municipalities. Dokhu VDC was merged with Phungling VDC to form new Taplejung Municipality.
On 10 March 2017, Nepal restructured the old administrative system into 753 new local level body thus Hangdeva, Phurumbu and Phawakhola VDCs merged with the then Taplejung municipality and renamed it as Phungling Municipality. After merging more VDCs to the old Taplejung municipality the total area increased to and total population became 26,406. 
It is located at 27°21&#x27;0N 87°40&#x27;0E with an altitude of 1441 metres (4730 feet).

== Demography ==
The main inhabitants in Phungling are Limbu, Chhetri, Tamang, Brahman, Sherpa, Bhote, Newar, and Gurung.

== Transportation ==
Phungling Municipality is linked with roadway and airway. It is connected to rest of the country through the Mechi Highway, a 268-km road which begins in Kechana of Jhapa district and ends in Taplejung. Passenger buses and jeeps to Taplejung are easily available in Birtamod. Suketar Airport has flights from Biratnagar and Kathmandu.

== Media ==
To promote local culture Phungling has 3 FM radio stations: Radio Tamor - 102.0 MHz which is a community radio station, Taplejung F.M. - 94.0 MHz and Radio Faktanglung 89.8 MHz.

==Pathibhara Devi Temple==
One of the major attractions is the Pathibhara Devi Temple. This little-known region attracts tourists seeking spiritual fulfillment and blessings from the powerful Pathibhara Devi. Kiranti, Hindus and Buddhists reach the temple for celebrations during special occasions. The trek to pathibhara Devi (3794 m) combined with the natural and cultural experiences of the region make the visit a unique exhilarating experience. It takes a day to reach the temple on foot from Taplejung Bazaar. On the way to the temple are many species of rhododendron which are unique.

==Climate==
Phungling has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) with cool, dry winters and warm, rainy summers.

<text>Linda Down is an American woman born with cerebral palsy. She completed the 26.1 mile 1982 and 1984 New York City Marathon on crutches, because of her lack of motor coordination as well as muscle spasticity.

At a White House reception on October 27, 1982, President Ronald Reagan welcomed her with the thought that
:&quot;no one in that marathon showed more heart and more courage. Linda, the victim of cerebral palsy, is more familiar with the word &#x27;victory&#x27; than &#x27;victim&#x27;. She did the 26 miles of the marathon in 11 hours -- the first person to attempt to do that with the aid of crutches. And, Linda, if all of those people out there wouldn&#x27;t say I was being political, I&#x27;d say you truly &#x27;stayed the course&quot;.

<text>Armitage Shanks is a British manufacturer of bathroom fixtures and plumbing supplies, now part of the group Ideal Standard.

In 2004, Armitage Shanks had eight factories in the United Kingdom, the largest in Armitage, Staffordshire. Armitage Shanks is one of the sponsors of the Loo of the Year Awards.

==History==
The company that became Armitage Shanks was founded in 1817, by Thomas Bond in Armitage, Staffordshire. The Armitage &quot;sanitary pottery manufacture&quot; became a successful toilet manufacturer in the United Kingdom. In 1907, &quot;Armitage Ware Limited&quot; was incorporated.

In 1969, Armitage merged with &quot;Shanks Holdings Limited&quot;, a competing &quot;sanitary engineering company&quot; that was established in 1878 in Barrhead near Glasgow, Renfrewshire, producing the famous brand name Armitage Shanks.

In 1980, Armitage Shanks was purchased by Blue Circle Industries, and in February 1999, Blue Circle sold its bathroom division (consisting of Armitage Shanks and the Italian Ceramica Dolomite) to United States based American Standard Companies for US$430 million.

Following this purchase, the Armitage Shanks brand continued in the United Kingdom, and their former export markets. American Standard were acquired by Bain Capital in February 2007, and is now majority owned by Sun Capital Partners.

<text>Douglas Earl Applegate (March 27, 1928 – August 7, 2021) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio&#x27;s 18th congressional district from 1977 to 1995, as a member of the Democratic Party. Prior to his tenure in the United States House of Representatives he served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1961 to 1968, and in the Ohio Senate from 1969 to 1974.

Applegate was born in Steubenville, Ohio, the son of mayor and state representative Earl Applegate, and was educated at Steubenville High School. He was elected to the state house in the 1960 election alongside Michael Blischak in a multi-member district and later became the sole representative from the district after defeating Blischak in 1962. He served in the state house until his election to the state senate in the 1968 election. During his tenure in the state senate he defeated incumbent Republican senators John Longsworth and Kenneth F. Berry.

Applegate had planned on running to succeed Wayne Hays in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1978 election, but was selected to replace Hays as the Democratic nominee in the 1976 election after Hays resignation. He served until his retirement in the 1994 election during which he served on the Transportation, Public Works, and Veterans&#x27; Affairs committees. His ideological belief and ratings were mixed and ranged from liberal to conservative with the Americans for Democratic Action giving him scores between 5% and 80% while the American Conservative Union gave him scores ranging from 12.50% to 64.86%.

Applegate ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1988 primary as a favorite son. He only sought the six delegates from his districts, of which he won one, and voted for Michael Dukakis at the Democratic National Convention. He attempted to have Senator John Glenn, whom he had supported in the 1984 primary, be given the vice-presidential nomination, but was unsuccessful. Applegate died in 2021.

==Career==
===Ohio legislature===
====Elections====

Applegate and Michael Blischak were given the Democratic nomination to run for seats in the Ohio House of Representatives in the 1960 election and defeated Republican nominees Ed Griffith and William G. Powell. On January 19, 1962, Applegate announced that he would run for reelection and as the multi-member district was eliminated he ran in the Democratic primary against Blischak. He defeated Blischak in the primary and won reelection against Republican nominee Edward V. Miller in the general election. He won reelection in 1964 and 1966.

Following the 1972 reapportionment of districts Applegate&#x27;s 30th district was redrawn to include Republican Senator Kenneth F. Berry, who was originally from the 19th district. Berry won renomination in the Republican primary against William A. Wallace while Applegate faced no opposition. Applegate defeated Berry in the general election.

====Tenure====

Calabrese Jr. won the lieutenant gubernatorial nomination, but lost in the general election to Republican nominee John William Brown.

In 1965, Applegate was named as one of America&#x27;s outstanding young men by the U.S Junior Chamber of Commerce and was also nominated for the Ohio League of Young Democrat Clubs for their John F. Kennedy award.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
====Elections====


Applegate announced in 1975, that he would run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from the 18th congressional district in the 1978 election after Representative Hays announced that he would run for governor in the 1978 election. Hays withdrew from the 1976 election following a sex scandal and later resigned from the house. Fourteen of the eighteen Democratic leaders in the 18th congressional district voted in favor of Applegate, who was running against Alan Sherry and Joseph Loha, to replace Hays on the first ballot and then voted unanimously on the second ballot to give the nomination to Applegate on August 16. Applegate initially sought reelection to the state senate in the 1976 election, but Kinsey Milleson was later selected to replace him following Applegate&#x27;s replacement of Hays.

Representative John Wargo accused Applegate of having been selected by Hays to succeed himself, but Applegate stated that Wargo was overreacting and that he had no political debts to Hays. He selected former Representative Robert T. Secrest to serve as his honorary campaign chair. Applegate defeated Republican nominee Ralph R. McCoy and independent candidate William Crabbe, who was the mayor of Steubenville, in the 1976 election.

Applegate announced that he would seek reelection on January 13, 1978, and won against Republican nominee Bill Ress. Hays, who had been elected to the state house, considered running against Applegate in the 1980 Democratic primary, but chose not to citing his health and pleas from Applegate&#x27;s supporters. He defeated Republican nominee Gary L. Hammersley in the 1980 election.

Applegate won reelection in the 1982 election against Joseph Holmes&#x27; write-in candidacy. He defeated Republican nominee Kenneth Burt Jr. in the 1984 election.

He formed a political action committee to use the remaining $150,186 in his campaign funds. He served as the honorary chair of Jim Hart&#x27;s, who was his chief of staff, campaign to succeed him in the house. His district was targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee and Republican nominee Bob Ney defeated Democratic nominee Greg DiDonato in the election.

====Tenure====

During Applegate&#x27;s tenure in the house he served on the Transportation, Public Works and Veterans&#x27; Affairs committees. He sought a position on the Veterans&#x27; Affairs committee at the urging of Robert T. Secrest, who served as his campaign manager and on the committee during his tenure in the house. When he was appointed to the Veterans&#x27; Affairs committee in 1977, he replaced James V. Stanton, who had left to unsuccessfully run for the Democratic senatorial nomination. He served as the chair of the Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.

Applegate and Representatives Charles Vanik, Don Pease, Mary Rose Oakar, and Tom Luken lobbied for Thomas L. Ashley to be given the position of chair of the Budget committee for the 95th United States Congress. In 1978, the Lorain Journal and Mansfield News Journal ranked Applegate as one of the five least effective members of Ohio&#x27;s house delegation alongside Charles J. Carney, Samuel L. Devine, Tennyson Guyer, and Del Latta. He served as the chair of the Ohio Democratic congressional delegation during the 96th United States Congress until he asked for Louis Stokes to take over for him.

Applegate chose to stay neutral during the 1980 Democratic presidential primary between President Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy and hoped to attend the Democratic National Convention as an uncommitted delegate. He proposed a plank to the Democratic platform calling for the increased use of coal to reduce the United States&#x27; dependence on oil from other countries. He supported Senator John Glenn during the 1984 Democratic presidential primary.

===Presidential campaign===

Applegate proposed a favorite son coalition with Representative James Traficant to bring a focus on regional issues during the 1988 Democratic presidential primary stating that &quot;our districts are contiguous and our problems are parallel&quot;. Both men would run to gain the delegates from their congressional districts. Ohio Secretary of State Sherrod Brown stated that candidates would be allowed to appear on the presidential and other ballot lines. He ruled that despite laws preventing a candidate&#x27;s name from appearing on the ballot twice the presidential ballot line did not count as the voters were voting for delegates and not the candidate themselves.

Applegate announced on November 23, 1987, that he would run for president although he stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t have any great illusions of being sworn in as president of the United States&quot; and would instead focus on winning the six delegates from his district. Norma Agostini, the chair of the Harrison County Democratic Party, supported Applegate&#x27;s campaign. During his campaign Applegate raised $18,297 and spent $18,290.

Applegate received 25,068 votes in the Ohio primary where he won one county and delegate. He placed second in the 18th congressional district behind Michael Dukakis. He stated that he had succeeded in his goal in putting the issues facing the 18th congressional district before multiple presidential delegates and that he and his one delegate would lobby Dukakis at the national convention. He was later unsatisfied with Dukakis&#x27; stance and plan for acid rain and stated that he might vote for himself, as he was an unpledged delegate, with Jane Eberts, the delegate he won in Ohio, as a protest vote. Penny Federspill served as an alternate delegate for Applegate. Applegate gave his support to Dukakis after an aide told him that Dukakis would work with him on acid rain legislation. He received zero delegate votes for the presidential nomination.

Applegate was in favor of Glenn being given the vice-presidential nomination and created 10,000 bumper stickers for a Dukakis-Glenn ticket. Applegate and Marcy Kaptur worked together in support of Glenn and wrote letters to 210 Democratic members of Congress, who attended the convention as superdelegates, stating that Glenn would help Dukakis in gaining the votes of blue-collar voters who had supported Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. He was critical of Dukakis&#x27; selection of Lloyd Bentsen stating that it would hinder the campaign as &quot;Bentsen doesn&#x27;t have the national image and there&#x27;s very little that he can do for the Midwest, at least as far as I can see. John Glenn can do more for the South than Bentsen can in the Midwest, and the polls showed that.&quot;

==Later life==

During the 2006 election Applegate endorsed Zack Space for the Democratic nomination in the 18th congressional district against Ralph Applegate, who he had to state that he did not support nor was related to. Jason Wilson, who worked as a congressional intern for Applegate in 1990, was elected to the state senate in the 2006 election. He moved to Spring Hill, Florida later in his life and his wife died on June 5, 2020, before his death on August 7, 2021.

==Political positions==
===Crime===

Applegate wrote a letter to Governor Michael DiSalle in 1961, asking him to halt all executions, but DiSalle stated that the &quot;law of Ohio is such that I do not feel I could legally create a freeze on executions&quot;. He and Representative Sam Landes introduced legislation in the Ohio House of Representatives that would have made Ohio&#x27;s laws against obscene movies more strict. Applegate proposed legislation while serving in the Ohio House of Representatives that would make it illegal to huff glue or nail polish to become high and instituted a $25 fine for first-time offenders and a $50 fine for further violations. Applegate proposed legislation to the state senate in 1971, that would have the state subsidize the salaries of full-time police, deputy sheriffs, and firemen at the county, municipal, or town level.

He voted in favor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Applegate proposed a resolution to the Ohio Senate which called for President Richard Nixon to commute William Calley&#x27;s sentence.

He voted in favor of raising the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 in 1989.

He proposed legislation that would increase the power of the Ohio Air Pollution Control Board, give local governments the ability to adopt air pollution standards if they were less strict than the standards of the board, and increase the penalty for violations of the legislation.

Applegate co-sponsored legislation to reorganize Ohio&#x27;s state cabinet to establish a state Department of Environmental Protection which would combine the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Health, Water Pollution Control Board, and the Air Pollution Control Board. He opposed sulphur dioxide emissions controls imposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency on the use of Ohio coal in 1977, stating that &quot;If adopted, this plan would cause economic disaster in the Ohio Valley.&quot; He voted in favor of reducing the EPA&#x27;s budget by $133 million in 1978.

Applegate voted in favor of prohibiting aid or trade to Cuba and Vietnam. Applegate, Tony P. Hall, Bob McEwen, Tom Kindness, Ralph Regula, and Mike DeWine helped present petitions by the Veterans Vigil Society requesting for the full accounting of the 2,490 Americans that were missing in action in Indochina to Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill in 1984.

Applegate was given a score of 100% by the American Security Council Foundation in 1980, and was the only Democratic member of Congress from Ohio to receive a 100%. Applegate received score of 71% by the Nuclear Control Institute which was above the overall 47% they gave the house.

===Flag desecration===

In 1967, Applegate proposed legislation in the Ohio House of Representatives which would increase the penalties for the desecration of the American and Ohio flags by increasing the maximum fine from $100 to $1,000 and increasing the prison sentence from thirty days to one year. He stated that the point of the legislation was to crack down on anti-Vietnam War protesters who desecrated the flag. The legislation was passed in the state house with ninety votes in favor and no opposition. Applegate proposed legislation in 1979, which would deport any alien &quot;who in any way desecrates or defiles the American flag&quot;.

Applegate proposed legislation to expand the definition of what abuse towards the United States flag is in response to an art piece by Dread Scott entitled &quot;What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag&quot; in which the flag was on the floor. He supported the passage of a Flag Desecration Amendment.

Applegate stated that &quot;I am mad as hell&quot; and that &quot;What in God&#x27;s name is going on? This is an outrage. What will they allow next? Allow fornication in Times Square at high noon?&quot; after the Supreme Court ruled five to four that flag desecration was protected by the First Amendment in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;. He also stated that the Supreme Court had humiliated the American flag with its decision.

===Ratings===

Ralph Nader&#x27;s Congress Watch gave Applegate a score of 40% on consumer protection, government reform, taxation, energy, and waste-subsidy in 1978. The Consumer Federation of America gave him a score of 79% in 1982, and 67% in 1984. Congressional Quarterly reported that by 1980, he had voted in favor of legislation supported by Carter thirty percent of the time and that by 1984, he had voted with Reagan twenty-seven percent of the time. In 1991, he voted with the Democrats 68%, tied with Charlie Luken, meaning that he and Luken voted the most in favor of Bush Sr. out of the Democratic house delegation from Ohio. He voted in favor of legislation supported by President Bill Clinton 66% of the time in 1993.

Applegate was given a score of 30% by the Americans for Democratic Action in his first year in office in 1977, while the American Conservative Union gave him a score of 35.14%. He received his highest score from the American Conservative Union in 1979, when they gave him 64.85% while his lowest score from the organization was 12.5% in 1992. He received his lowest score from the Americans for Democratic Action in 1991, when he was given 5%, and his highest score from the organization was 80% in 1993. He was given a rating of 40% by the American Conservative Union, with a lifetime score of 34.20%, and 50% from the Americans for Democratic Action when he left office in 1994.

Conservatives Against Liberal Legislation gave Applegate a score of 55% in 1980. He was one of the sixty-six member of the house targeted by the National Committee for an Effective Congress for the 1982 election. Congressional Quarterly stated that he voted with the conservative coalition 72% of the time by 1982. In 1982, the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, led by Paul Weyrich, gave him a score of 58%


===Voting and elections===

Applegate and Representative Anthony Calabrese Jr. introduced legislation which would have placed a ballot proposition to decrease the voting age to nineteen onto the 1966 ballot. However, the legislation failed after the Ohio House of Representatives voted seventy-one to sixty-two in favor which was twelve votes short of a three-fifths majority. He proposed legislation in 1970 and 1971, which would lower the voting age to eighteen while the minimum age for holding office would be twenty-one.

In 1969, Applegate and Senator William B. Nye co-sponsored legislation by Senator Oliver Ocasek to change the Constitution of Ohio to allow people aged nineteen to vote, but the legislation stated that nobody under the age of twenty-one could be elected or appointed to office. The Ohio Senate voted thirty to three in favor of the legislation. However, the referendum failed with 1,274,334 people voting against while 1,226,592 voted in favor. He stated that it was &quot;paradoxical that 60 percent of the young men who are Vietnam battle casualties do not have the right to vote – a right they are fighting to defend&quot;.

Applegate supported and introduced legislation to have all presidential primaries held at the same time on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in May. He opposed the special election held to fill the Ohio&#x27;s 17th congressional district following John M. Ashbrook&#x27;s death stating that it was &quot;a waste of the taxpayers&#x27; money&quot; due to its $175,000 cost and that its sole purpose was &quot;to get someone in who will do nothing, but vote the way the White House wants.&quot; He also criticized the special election as the 17th congressional district wouldn&#x27;t exist after 1982.

<text>Johnny García Lopez (born 19 July 1978) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a defender.

==Club career==
García made his debut for Club Deportivo Guadalajara of the Primera División de México as a midfielder in the 2001 Spring season, eventually playing nine games that season. After three more seasons as a midfielder, García was moved to central defense by Hans Westerhof, where he was a consistent starter throughout 2004. He joined Chivas USA in August 2006. His stint with Chivas USA lasted a short while, as he was released and consequently bought by Jaguares de Chiapas, marking his return to the Mexican Primera Division. With Chivas, García made a last minute goal against his current team Chiapas F.C.. This secured Chivas a semi-final berth, where it played against Pachuca and managed another last minute goal. During the 2007 Draft Santos Laguna acquired him from Chiapas F.C.

<doc id="1269856" wikidata="Q4998921" url="?curid=1269856" title="Burke &amp; Wills">
<text>Burke &amp; Wills is a 1985 Australian adventure film directed by Graeme Clifford, starring Jack Thompson and Nigel Havers. The film is based on the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition across Australia.

The film follows Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke and William John Wills in their crossing of Australia&#x27;s interior in 1860–1. The film&#x27;s account of the story changes the expedition&#x27;s ending by having the explorers actually reach the northern coast. This upbeat idea was vehemently criticised by Australian reviewers. The film was released a week after the similarly themed comedy &quot;Wills &amp; Burke&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==

Irish explorer Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke (Thompson) and British scientist William John Wills (Havers), have set out to make the first maps of the interior region of the Australian continent in 1860. During their journey, they and their compatriots run low on food and suffer from heat exhaustion until there is only one survivor.

==Production==
Graeme Clifford was an Australian who had become a leading editor in Hollywood and had moved into directing. He was interested in making a film about the Burke and Wills expedition and in 1978 approached EMI Films, who had commissioned a script from Terence Rattigan based on the story. This did not work out so Clifford then hired a fellow Australian expatriate, Michael Thomas, to write a screenplay. Early financial assistance was provided by David Williams of Greater Union.

Clifford then went to make his first feature, &quot;Frances&quot;, and discovered that Greater Union&#x27;s enthusiasm for the film had cooled. However, he received support from Hoyts-Edgley who agreed to finance. The budget would be particularly high because of Clifford&#x27;s insistence at filming along the actual path of the expedition. It was the second most expensive Australian film at the time after &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;. Greater Union decided to back &quot;Wills &amp; Burke&quot; instead.

Charlton Heston was once interested in playing Burke but Clifford says he only ever envisioned Jack Thompson in that role. After seeing &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, he wanted Nigel Havers to play Wills, a decision opposed by Actors Equity, but this was overturned at arbitration.

Filming started in September 1984 and took 13 weeks. Many of the original locations were used, such as Coopers Creek, because Clifford thought it was important to be as authentic as possible. Additional filming was completed in England some months later.

Painter Sidney Nolan came out on set and was the film&#x27;s official painter.

==Release==
The film premiered in Melbourne on 2 November 1985 before Prince Charles and Lady Diana; the first Australian Royal Premiere. It opened in other Australian cities on 7 November 1985, was shown at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival in May, the Toronto Film Festival in September 1986 and was released worldwide in early 1986.

&quot;Burke &amp; Wills&quot; performed disappointingly, grossing $1,567,000 at the box office in Australia. Jonathan Chissick later said &quot;people in Australia were just not interested in seeing a picture about these two guys dying in the desert.&quot; The poor box office was also blamed on the poor reviews of &quot;Wills &amp; Burke&quot; that was released at the same time.

The film was released in the US but also performed disappointingly there.

The film was released on VHS Video in Australia by Charter Entertainment in 1987 and released in the USA on 26 October 1988 by Nelson Entertainment. The film was released on laserdisc in the USA.

The film was released on DVD in 2014 through Umbrella Entertainment. Although released in Australia on the PAL format, the disc is region free. Umbrella Entertainment used the re-mastered version of the film produced by the National Film and Sound Archive (Australia) as part of the sesquicentenary activities in 2010; the sound was left as 2-speaker stereo. The DVD has no menu on the disc and the film is presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;satisfying entertainment despite its length and seemingly downbeat subject.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Miscellaneous==
A 1975 British documentary series called &quot;The Explorers&quot; on the BBC featured the Australian expedition story in the episode titled &quot;Burke and Wills&quot;. Directed by Lord Snowdon, it was narrated by David Attenborough in the UK version (but by Anthony Quinn in the 1976 US broadcast version), and coincidentally the same Australian actor Chris Haywood who played Tom McDonagh also previously appeared in the British documentary released around a decade earlier. Moreover, in the same year as this film, Haywood also played a cameo role of the constable in the &quot;Burke &amp; Wills&quot; spoof parody &quot;Wills &amp; Burke&quot; (1985).

<text>Innisfallen ( ) or Inishfallen (from , meaning &#x27;Faithlinn&#x27;s island&#x27;) is an island in Lough Leane; one of the three Lakes of Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland. 
Innisfallen is home to the ruins of Innisfallen Abbey. 

==Geography==
Innisfallen is situated about the midway in Lough Leane, County Kerry. The island is some in area, mostly wooded, with undulating hills and many slopes. It lies within the Killarney National Park.

===Access===
It is possible for tourists to visit the island during the summer months, with boats leaving from Ross Castle throughout the day.

== History ==

Innisfallen is home to the ruins of Innisfallen Abbey, one of the most impressive archaeological remains dating from the early Christian period. The monastery was founded in 640 by Saint Finian and was occupied for approximately 950 years. Over a period of about 300 of these, the monks wrote the Annals of Innisfallen, which chronicle the early history of Ireland as it was known to the monks. The monks were dispossessed of the abbey on 18 August 1594, by Elizabeth I.

The location of the monastery on the island is thought to have given rise to the name Lough Leane (Irish &quot;Loch Léin&quot;), which in English means &quot;Lake of Learning&quot;. According to tradition the Irish High King Brian Boru received his education at Innisfallen under Maelsuthain O&#x27;Carroll.
Maelsuthain has been credited as the possible originator of the &quot;Annals&quot;.

==Structures==
While the abbey dates back to the seventh century, the oldest extant structure, dated to the tenth century, is the western two-thirds of the abbey church. The remainder of the church and the main abbey complex were constructed in the thirteenth century. A third structure, an oratory with a Hiberno-Romanesque doorway, dates from the twelfth century.

==Literature==
The island is the subject of the melody &quot;Innisfallen, the Island — Sweet Innisfallen&quot; by Thomas Moore, of which the first verse is: 

It is also the subject of &quot;The Abbot of Innisfallen. A Killarney Legend&quot;, a poem by William Allingham, first published in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (August 1864). This was in turn set to music by Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer as &quot;The Abbot of Innisfalen&quot;, Op. 5, for baritone, chorus and orchestra, which won the cantata prize at the 1908 Feis Ceoil in Dublin.

<text>Dara Shawn Daivari () (born April 30, 1984) is an American retired professional wrestler better known by the ring name Shawn Daivari. He is signed to WWE as a producer. He is also known for his time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling where he is a former TNA X Division Champion and has also made appearances in Ring of Honor and Lucha Underground.

Daivari along with fellow wrestlers Ken Anderson, brother Ariya Daivari, Molly Holly, and Arik Cannon operate a wrestling school called The Academy: School of Professional Wrestling in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1999–2004)===
Daivari grew up admiring Mick Foley and Bret Hart. His childhood hero was Shawn Michaels. He participated in his first professional wrestling match at age 15. He started his career in the upper midwest independent scene. He is known for representing Iran for international title matches.

On October 19, 1998, Daivari appeared on &quot;Nitro&quot; as a fan being interviewed by Mike Tenay.

He appeared on the February 26, 2003, episode of &quot;Explosion&quot; and wrestled a tag team match against Mike Sanders and Glenn Gilberti with Ken Anderson. He also appeared on the October 5, 2003, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; as Shawn Daivari, losing his match against Tommy Dreamer. He also made four appearances for independent promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) between April and July 2004.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2004–2007, 2011, 2018–present) ===

==== Managing Muhammad Hussan (2004–2005) ====
Daivari signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in August 2004 and debuted on the December 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; alongside Muhammad Hassan as Khosrow Daivari, later shortened to Daivari. Their gimmick was that of two Arab Americans who were tired of the prejudice and stereotypes they were receiving after the 9/11 attacks. Ironically, Daivari would scream instructions in Persian to Hassan when working as his manager. In the weeks leading up to their debut, the two men would appear on &quot;Raw&quot; in vignettes promoting their hatred towards &quot;America&quot;. In the following weeks, they would back up their words with actions, initiating a feud with &quot;Raw&quot; announcers Jim Ross and Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, 2005, Daivari and Hassan were involved in an angle with Hulk Hogan. While attacking injured wrestler Eugene, Hogan came to the ring and ejected both men from the ring.

The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Daivari and Hassan interrupted Shawn Michaels during a promo. The two attacked Michaels and left him helpless in the ring. This led to Daivari&#x27;s first singles match in WWE, on the April 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Although Michaels was heavily favored, Daivari, with help from Hassan, got the upset win. Enraged, Michaels demanded a match against both Daivari and Hassan. &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager Eric Bischoff refused to grant a handicap match, but instead ordered Michaels to find a partner. That partner turned out to be Daivari and Hassan&#x27;s WrestleMania foe Hulk Hogan.

On the April 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels was once again double teamed by Daivari and Hassan until Hogan appeared to make the save. Hogan accepted Michaels&#x27; offer to tag and the match was set for the Backlash pay-per-view on May 1. At Backlash, Hogan and Michaels picked up the win which led to friction between the two since Hassan blamed Daivari for the loss. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Hassan verbally and physically attacked Daivari leaving their future as a team in question.
Both Daivari and Hassan were later drafted to the SmackDown! brand on the June 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as part of a package deal. On the July 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, then General Manager Theodore Long put Daivari in a match against The Undertaker for that night, and Muhammad Hassan in a match against The Undertaker at The Great American Bash on July 24 in which the winner would be the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. Daivari was squashed easily in that match, after which Hassan began to pray on the ramp, summoning five masked men to the ring. The masked men beat and strangled The Undertaker into submission, and Hassan put him in the camel clutch. Afterward, the masked men carried Daivari off like a martyr. The controversial imagery aired unedited in North America despite the terrorist attacks in London earlier that day, but was removed from the Australian and UK broadcasts. This episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; was unusually taped on Monday and, at the time, aired on Thursday, so the skit was taped three days before the attack occurred.

In late July, UPN requested that WWE keep the Muhammad Hassan character off of their network. WWE complied, effectively removing him from &quot;SmackDown!&quot; at The Great American Bash. After Hassan lost in a match with The Undertaker, Hassan was given the &quot;Last Ride&quot; through an open stage ramp onto a concrete floor. It was reported that he sustained serious injuries and had to be rushed to a nearby medical facility; this was an angle aimed to &quot;kill off&quot; the character.

Although Hassan would eventually retire from professional wrestling, Daivari reported to WWE&#x27;s Deep South Wrestling (DSW) developmental territory for training and repackaging. He returned from DSW and, after working in Minneapolis, made his debut in September 2005 on Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) television returning as his &quot;Sheik&quot; Daivari persona.

==== Various alliances (2005–2007) ====
On the November 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Daivari returned, acting as Kurt Angle&#x27;s anointed special guest referee in the tag team match between Shawn Michaels and John Cena against Angle and Chris Masters. During the match, Daivari favored Angle and Masters, who won the match via disqualification when Michaels was caught with a chair Angle brought in.

On the November 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Angle announced that Daivari was to be the referee for all his future matches, including his WWE Championship match against John Cena for the title at Survivor Series on November 27. Mr. McMahon rescinded that at the kangaroo court trial of Eric Bischoff on the December 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Daivari remained aligned with Kurt Angle as his manager.

On the January 13, 2006, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle and Daivari moved to the SmackDown! brand, where Angle won the World Heavyweight Championship in a battle royal that same night. Angle later revealed that his contract on &quot;Raw&quot; had expired, which allowed them to switch brands. Angle was already signed to face Shawn Michaels on the January 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, however this non-title match went ahead, but Daivari would accidentally cost Angle the match against Michaels. Afterwards, Daivari and Angle argued, but when Daivari slapped Angle, he was &quot;Angle Slammed&quot; over the ropes and down to the floor on the outside of the ring. During the break, on WWE.com &quot;Unlimited&quot;, an enraged Angle made it known that Daivari&#x27;s services were no longer needed.

A short time later, Daivari faced his former client in a match, during which Mark Henry, the number one contender for Angle&#x27;s title, attacked Angle. After the match, Daivari officially announced that he was now managing Henry and continued to manage Henry during his feud with The Undertaker. Daivari would not be seen on television in the weeks leading up to WrestleMania 22 on April 2 when, at &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot;, he suffered a chokeslam and &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; at the hands of The Undertaker onto the lid of a casket.
On the April 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Daivari made his return bringing in the debuting The Great Khali to attack The Undertaker during his match with Mark Henry. The next week, Daivari officially presented him to the crowd, hyping him as an &quot;unstoppable monster&quot;. Over the following weeks, Daivari would accompany Khali to the ring as he attacked various &quot;SmackDown!&quot; superstars. This would all lead up to a match with The Undertaker at Judgment Day on May 21, which Khali would end up winning. Daivari and Khali appeared as guests on &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; on the June 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, in which Roddy Piper made fun of Khali, who supposedly couldn&#x27;t speak English. Eventually Piper stood on the bottom rope, attempting to match height with Khali, he managed to say: &quot;If this was twenty years ago&quot;, before Khali grabbed him by the throat. Daivari made Khali put Piper down and straightened Piper&#x27;s jacket disrespectfully, at which Piper slapped Daivari, but was then given a chop by Khali. The Undertaker was the original guest on the Pit, but he declined the invitation a few days before. Daivari continued to accompany The Great Khali to the ring when Khali wrestled or attacked other wrestlers, but when The Great Khali became inactive due to injury, Daivari was taken off the road as well.

Daivari and The Great Khali were moved to the ECW brand officially when they made their ECW debuts on the October 31 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, in which Daivari defeated &quot;The Reject&quot; Shannon Moore. Daivari&#x27;s original theme music was used as well as his Persian rants on the microphone. Afterwards, Moore was manhandled by The Great Khali. Daivari continued his winning streak over the next several weeks with The Great Khali usually following up the contest with a chokebomb on Daivari&#x27;s opponent. At December to Dismember on December 3, Daivari got a victory over Tommy Dreamer following a schoolboy roll-up. Dreamer then chased Daivari all the way to the back, but The Great Khali appeared and caught Dreamer, planting him on the steel ramp with a chokebomb. On the January 8, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Great Khali moved to the Raw brand without Daivari. The following night, however, Daivari accompanied Khali to the ring for his match against Dreamer on &quot;ECW&quot;.

Daivari returned to the SmackDown! brand on the February 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, defeating then Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms in a non-title match. He wrestled in a Cruiserweight Open for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship at No Way Out on February 18, won by Chavo Guerrero. He began wrestling in the Cruiserweight division. He was involved in a feud between Kane and The Great Khali, once again promoting Khali in March. His first match against Kane involved him being dragged backstage by Kane&#x27;s chain and hook leaving his back with multiple bruises. A few weeks later, Daivari had a rematch with Kane and was again defeated.

==== Singles competition (2007) ====
Daivari returned to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; a few months later, teaming up with Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Jamie Noble against Jimmy Wang Yang, Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a losing effort. On the June 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Daivari competed in a fatal four-way number one contender match for the Cruiserweight Championship, which he lost to Yang and also involved Shannon Moore and Noble.

Daivari was drafted back to the Raw brand in the supplemental draft on June 17, 2007. He re-debuted on the June 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, losing to Jeff Hardy. On the July 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Daivari was defeated by Cody Rhodes who had to win his match or else being fired from WWE. Daivari&#x27;s losing streak continued when he failed to win the position of General Manager of &quot;Raw&quot; by been eliminated early in the battle royal the week after Rhodes defeated him. Daivari then started to get on a roll on &quot;Heat&quot; (&quot;Raw&quot;&#x27;s sister show) being victorious against Super Crazy and &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan. His return on the September 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; saw him lose to Duggan in a flag match.

On October 16, Daivari was released from his WWE contract.

==== Sporadic appearances and producer role (2011, 2018–2020, 2021–present) ====
On May 3, 2011, Daivari made his WWE return by competing in a dark match before the &quot;SmackDown&quot; tapings, losing to Ted DiBiase. In 2018, Daivari made his second return to WWE during a segment at Greatest Royal Rumble in Saudi Arabia where he and his brother, Ariya Daivari, were driven out of the ring by four new Saudi recruits. He was later hired by WWE as a producer in January 2019, and was eventually released on April 15, 2020, as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. He returned on June 11, 2021.

=== Independent circuit (2007–2008) ===

Daivari made his debut for Professional Championship Wrestling in Arlington, Texas, at PCW&#x27;s &quot;Heroes 2 Legends&quot; event in November 2007. He wrestled J.T. Lamotta and &quot;Jiggle-O&quot; James Johnson in a triple threat match for the PCW Cruiserweight Championship, which Lamotta won. He returned to PCW on February 23, 2008, at PCW&#x27;s &quot;Big Bang &#x27;08&quot; event to again wrestle a triple threat match for the PCW Cruiserweight Championship, this time against Robert Evans and Aaron Eagle, who won and became the new champion. On September 6, 2008, it was announced by The Bussey Brothers that Daivari would return on September 20, 2008, to team with them to take on Aaron Eagle and a partner of his choosing. Eagle had chosen Action Jackson to be his tag team partner. However, Jackson was injured at the hands of Mace Malone. PCW World Heavyweight Champion, Mike Foxx, who was supposedly suspended and also Eagle&#x27;s main rival, surprisingly saved Eagle from an attack and announced he would be Eagle&#x27;s partner. The stipulation was that if Eagle did not win, he could never get another PCW World Heavyweight Championship shot again. On September 20, Daivari and The Busseys defeated Eagle and Foxx when Foxx turned on Eagle and Daivari debuted his new finisher move, the &quot;WMD&quot; – &quot;Weapon of Mass Destruction&quot; (a DDT to a kneeling opponent), for the victory. Afterwards, Foxx announced he would give Eagle one final title shot at &quot;Sick &#x27;n&#x27; Twisted&quot; on October 11.

On April 4, 2008, Daivari made his AMW debut in a triple threat match against Wally Darkmon and Robert Evans for the AMW Light Heavyweight Championship. Daivari won the match to become the new AMW Light Heavyweight Champion. During most of 2008, he feuded with Wally Darkmon and on September 12, 2008, he lost the AMW Light Heavyweight Championship to Darkmon in a casket match.

In June 2008, Davari took part in an Irish Whip Wrestling (IWW) event in the ESB Arena of Dublin, Ireland, where he lost in the main event to Mandrake for the IWW International Heavyweight Championship.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2008–2009) ===

Daivari debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the June 12, 2008, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; as the captain to Team International in 2008&#x27;s World X Cup Tournament. Daivari then signed a contract with TNA. On the July 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, after the conclusion of the X Cup, it was announced that he had joined the TNA roster under the name of Sheik Abdul Bashir. Retaining his anti-American gimmick and also adding a bullying mean streak, he quickly established himself as a heel after helping Petey Williams retain the TNA X Division Championship over Consequences Creed at Hard Justice on August 10, as well as delivering promos to draw heat. His official debut match on &quot;Impact!&quot; was a victory over Jay Lethal.

Bashir won the X Division Championship at No Surrender on September 14, by defeating Williams and Creed in a three-way match. At Bound for Glory IV on October 12, Bashir defeated Creed in another match for the X Division Championship. On the October 23 live episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Bashir successfully defended the X Division Championship against Jay Lethal. After the match, he attacked Rhino after being confronted by him over his political views.
On October 30, it was announced that Daivari was taken to &quot;wrestler court&quot; at the week&#x27;s &quot;Impact!&quot; tapings following a rib he played on Kip James during a flight they shared. Daivari pulled aside a flight attendant, who then announced over the loudspeaker that Kip was celebrating his 65th birthday. He was taken to wrestler court because it was determined that he hadn&#x27;t spent enough time in the company to pull a rib on a veteran. Brother Ray served as the judge while B.G. James represented Kip and Brother Devon represented Daivari, and agent Pat Kenney served as the bailiff for the proceedings. Daivari was found guilty and was required to supply the locker room beer and booze, which he did on Tuesday night after the tapings.

On the November 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Bashir lost the X Division Championship to Eric Young. During the match, Bashir shoved TNA Official Shane Sewell to the mat after Sewell questioned Bashir and the TNA audience of Bashir&#x27;s actions during the match. Sewell became enraged, removed his shirt and attacked Bashir, which led Eric Young to hit his Death Valley driver on Bashir and pinning him for the win and the championship. However, Bashir was awarded the championship back the following week due to Sewell&#x27;s interference, thus continuing his original title reign and making Young&#x27;s title reign null and void. Sewell helped Young to defeat Bashir for the title for the second time at Final Resolution on December 7, ending Bashir&#x27;s reign at 84 days. After the match, Bashir bloodied Sewell and tried to leave with the championship belt, but was stopped by Jim Cornette who announced that he had decided to vacate the championship. At Genesis on January 11, 2009, Sewell defeated Bashir in a grudge match that ended their feud.

In July, Bashir formed an alliance with Eric Young, Kiyoshi and The British Invasion (Doug Williams, Brutus Magnus and Rob Terry) known as World Elite. They were also later joined by Homicide. At Final Resolution on December 20, Bashir took part in the &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; match and was able to pick up one of the four briefcases. However, the briefcase he had picked up included a pink slip, which led to him being immediately fired from the company. Daivari would later say he originally signed a two-year extension with the understanding that Jeff Jarrett would be his boss, but after Jarrett stepped down a month later, he could not see eye to eye with the new management and asked for his release.

=== Return to ROH (2010–2011) ===
Daivari made his return to ROH on February 5, 2010, at the tapings of &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; on HDNet, once again portraying an anti-American heel. At the March 6 tapings, he joined Prince Nana&#x27;s stable The Embassy. On June 19, 2010, at Death Before Dishonor VIII, he participated in a gauntlet match for Roderick Strong&#x27;s ROH World Championship. On September 11, 2010, at Glory By Honor IX, Daivari unsuccessfully challenged Eddie Edwards for the ROH World Television Championship.

=== Lucha Underground (2015) ===
On April 15, 2015, Daivari made his debut at &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; as DelAvar Daivari, a wrestler from a wealthy family, being seen sitting in attendance during the night within the audience. On the April 22, 2015, episode, Daivari attacked El Texano Jr. after Texano pushed him, which cost Texano&#x27;s team the Lucha Underground Trios Championship match. On May 13, 2015, Daivari made his in-ring debut against Texano, which Daivari won by disqualification after Texano attacked the referee. On May 20, 2015, Daivari hired Big Ryck as his bodyguard, both of them attacking Texano as well as Bengala. Due to the alliance not paying off for Daivari, he attacked Ryck with a steel folding chair during a seven-way match at &quot;Ultima Lucha&quot;.

Daivari didn&#x27;t appear in Season 2. However, he wrestled Paul London in a dark match at &quot;Ultima Lucha Dos&quot; in which he was defeated.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2010–2018) ===
Daivari made his debut in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW) in &quot;At Oddball Wrestling&quot; on August 14, 2010, where The Daivari Brothers (Shawn and his sibling Arya), lost to The Ring Rydas. On November 10, 2010, in the first event of the tour, he defeated Dunkan Disorderly in Bordeaux, France, to win the AWR No Limits Championship. Daivari made his American Wrestling Rampage debut on AWR&#x27;s seven-night &quot;Twisted Steel Tour&quot;. On May 8, 2011, at Pro Wrestling Syndicate &quot;Vendetta&quot; event, Daivari won the vacant PWS New York State Championship. Several days later at Canadian Wrestling&#x27;s Elite, he and Ariya Daivari went to the finals CWE Tag Team Championship Tournament, but lost to Danny Duggan and Kenny Omega.

In June 2011, Daivari, working under the ring name Dubai, was announced as one of the four team captains for the pilot tapings of &quot;All Wheels Wrestling&quot;. At the pilot tapings on June 29, Dubai was first defeated by RPM (Jay Lethal) in a five-minute Iron Man match and then by Schwagg Dutt (Sonjay Dutt) in an Ultimate X match, which also included Aaron Aguilera and RPM. In December 2011, Daivari took part in TNA&#x27;s India project, Ring Ka King, where he resumed the Abdul Bashir gimmick and formed The Sheiks with his brother Arya, who worked as Mustafa Bashir.

On May 12, 2012, Daivari won the Big Time Wrestling Cruiserweight Championship. In October, he and Sonjay Dutt wrestled for Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) challenging the Adrenaline Express for the FWE Tag Team Championship. On October 6, Daivari defeated Crowbar in the House of Hardcore&#x27;s (HOH) first show. On a telecast of &quot;Portland Wrestling Uncut&quot; which aired on November 3, 2012, on Portland, Oregon, station KPTV, Daivari lost via pinfall to local star Exile, though the outcome was disputed because Daivari pointed out that he had his foot on the bottom rope when he was pinned.

As of 2018, he has only made a few appearances on the independent circuit, most notably for Insane Championship Wrestling and The Brian Kendrick&#x27;s promotion Wrestling Pro Wrestling (WPW).

=== Return to Impact Wrestling (2020–2021) ===
On October 24, 2020, at Bound for Glory, he made an unannounced appearance as a participant in the Call Your Shot gauntlet match under the ring name Daivari, which he failed to win as he was eliminated by Brian Myers. At Turning Point, Daivari lost to Eddie Edwards. Daivari made his return at Genesis as a competitor in the fourth Super X Cup tournament, where he lost in the first round to Jake Something.

<text>Hilaire Penet (born 1501?) was a French composer of the Renaissance, who worked for at least the earlier part of his life in Rome.

== Life and works ==
Unusually for a Renaissance composer, more is known of his earlier life than his later; indeed nothing at all is known of him after 1520. He was probably born in 1501, since his age is given as 14 in a document of 1515, and he was probably born near Poitiers. He served as a singer in the papal chapel from 1514, when he arrived there in the care of Carpentras, until 1520 when he left never to return. Since much of his music was published in the 1530s and later, he may have still been alive then and working elsewhere; presumably had he been still working in association with the papal chapel, there would be records of his employment.

Penet is most famous as the composer of &quot;Descendit angelus Domini&quot;, a four-voice motet which was used both by Palestrina and Costanzo Porta as source material for mass composition. The motet circulated widely in Europe and apparently was quite popular; Penet can be seen as a kind of Renaissance one-hit wonder on the strength and popularity of this refined, elegant composition. He also wrote two settings of the Magnificat which have survived, another motet (&quot;Virgo prudentissima&quot;), as well as a handful of secular chansons, all of which are settings of current popular tunes.

<text>In Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;), marriage (&quot;nikāḥ&quot; نکاح) is a legal and social contract between two individuals. Marriage is an act of Islam and is strongly recommended. Polygyny is permitted in Islam under some conditions, but polyandry is forbidden.

==Types of marriage==

===Nikāḥ===
The &quot;Nikāḥ&quot; (Arabic: نكاح, literally, &quot;to collect and bind together&quot;) is the first—and most common—form of marriage for Muslims. It is described in the Qur&#x27;an in Surah 4:4.

Regulations:
*While intended to be a permanent state, it can be terminated by the husband engaging in the &quot;Talaq&quot; process or the wife seeking a &quot;Khula&quot;.
*The couple inherit from each other.
*A legal contract is signed when entering the marriage. However it is not a requirement that the contract be in writing. It may be oral, especially amongst illiterates; and if an agreed end-date is specified in the nikāḥ contract:
**In Sunni jurisprudence, the contract is invalid.
**In Shia jurisprudence, the contract defines a temporary marriage, &quot;nikāḥ mut&#x27;ah&quot;.

Requirement of witnesses:
*two witnesses from both sides

Permission from Wali:
*Sunni: Compulsory (Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali) &quot;or&quot; Strongly recommended (Hanafi)
*Shia: Depending on the scholar, it is either obligatory or obligatory based on precaution.

===Nikah Halala===

Nikah halala is also known as &quot;tahleel&quot; marriage and is a practice in which a woman, after being divorced by a final divorce, marries another man, consummates the marriage, and divorces immediately for the sole purpose of remarrying her former husband. It is prohibited in Islamic law.

=== Nikāḥ Ijtimaa ===

&quot;Nikah ijtimaa&quot;, or combined marriage, is a form of marriage practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, in which multiple men would have intercourse with a woman, and if she bore a child, she would choose one of the men to be the father of the child. This form of marriage was outlawed by Islam, and traditional jurisprudence requires that any man and woman be married prior to sexual intercourse.

===Nikah Istibdaa===
Nikah Istibdaa is a marriage ( نکاح استبضاع) in which a husband would send his wife to another person, usually of noble lineage, to have sexual relations with him. The husband would refrain from sexual relations with his wife until she became pregnant by the other man. Afterwards, the man would claim paternity of the conceived child. This was done to get a child of noble breed. It was eradicated by Islam.

===Nikāḥ Misyar===

Nikāḥ Misyaar is a nikāḥ for Sunnis carried out via the normal contractual procedure, with the specificity that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of polygamy, the wife&#x27;s rights to housing, and maintenance money (&quot;nafaqa&quot;), and the husband&#x27;s right of homekeeping, and access etc. The difference between this and Mut&#x27;ah is that Mut&#x27;ah has the condition of a definite time period and a separation date prior to a marriage contract. Sunnah scholars have said it is permissible to marry a woman with the intention of getting divorced, if the wife is not informed or expecting a divorce during a marriage contract.

===Nikāḥ ‘urfī===

===Nikāḥ Mut‘ah===

&quot;Nikah mut&#x27;ah&quot; , literally &quot;pleasure marriage&quot;; temporary marriage or &quot;sigheh&quot; () is a private and verbal temporary marriage contract that is practiced in Twelver Shia Islam in which the duration of the marriage and the &quot;mahr&quot; must be specified and agreed upon in advance. It is a private contract made in a verbal or written format. A declaration of the intent to marry and an acceptance of the terms are required as in other forms of marriage in Islam.

According to Shia Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned &quot;nikah mut&#x27;ah&quot; (fixed-term marriage, called muta&#x27;a in Iraq and sigheh in Iran), which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden. Some Western writers have argued that mut&#x27;ah approximates prostitution.

Some sources say the Nikah mut&#x27;ah has no prescribed minimum or maximum duration, but others, such as &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Islam&quot;, indicate the minimum duration of the marriage is debatable and durations of at least three days, three months or one year have been suggested.

Some Muslims and Western scholars have stated that both Nikah mut&#x27;ah and Nikah misyar are Islamically void attempts to religiously sanction prostitution which is otherwise forbidden. The Zaidi Shia reject &quot;Mutah&quot; marriage.

===Nikāḥ Shighār===
Nikāḥ Shighā is marriage (نکاح شغار) in which two men would exchange their daughters, sisters or other close women for marriage without paying mahr. It was prohibited by Muhammad.

===Interfaith marriage===
Interfaith marriages are recognized between Muslims and Non-Muslim People of the Book (usually enumerated as Jews, Christians, and Sabians). Historically, in Islamic culture and traditional Islamic law Muslim women have been forbidden from marrying Christian or Jewish men, whereas Muslim men have been permitted to marry Christian or Jewish women.

Although historically Sunni Islam prohibited Muslim women to marry Non-Muslim men in interfaith marriages, in various parts of the world interfaith marriages between Muslim women and Non-Muslim men take place at substantial rates, contravening the traditional Sunni understanding of &quot;ijma&quot;. For example, in the United States, about 10% of Muslim women are married to Non-Muslim men. The tradition of reformist and progressive Islam does permit marriage between Muslim women and Non-Muslim men; Islamic scholars opining this view include Hassan Al-Turabi, and some others.

==Restrictions on marriage==

===Polygyny===

Muslim men are allowed to practise polygyny, that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to four, per Sura 4 Verse 3.

Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted. One of the main reasons for this would be the potential questioning of paternal lineage.

===Permissible age===
&quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; permits marriage once a person reaches sexual maturity (i.e.: menstruation, voice changing, wet dreams) (&quot;baligh&quot;). Sexual maturity in Sharia law is typically understood to mean puberty. At the same time, intercourse is forbidden until they are able to physically bear it.

===Other religions===

Traditionally, Muslim jurists hold that Muslim women may only enter into marriage with Muslim men. The Qur&#x27;an explicitly allows Muslim men to marry chaste women of the People of the Book, a term which includes Jews and Christians.

===Arranged and forced marriages===
An engagement may be arranged between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (&quot;wali&quot;), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or performed under coercion is illegal according to the majority of scholars.

If a girl has not attained the age of puberty, the vast majority of scholars hold that she cannot be married; and many stipulate that it must be in her best interest in order to be considered a valid marriage. There is some dispute as to whether or not an under-age bride can leave her family&#x27;s custody and be transferred to her husband&#x27;s custody, if she has not yet reached puberty. Some evidence supporting both sides can be seen in the following narrations from Muhammad:

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 Narrated &#x27;Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that &#x27;Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).

Sahih Bukhari 7.18 Narrated &#x27;Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for &#x27;Aisha&#x27;s hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said &quot;But I am your brother.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;You are my brother in Allah&#x27;s religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.&quot;

However, evidence from other Islamic sources seems to suggest that this is not something allowed for all Muslims; rather specifically for Muhammad. The evidence for this view is as follows:

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: &quot;A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness).&quot; [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others]

It is reported in a hadith that A&#x27;ishah related that she once asked the Prophet: &quot;In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?&quot; He replied: &quot;Yes, she must give her permission.&quot; She then said: &quot;But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!&quot; He replied: &quot;Her silence is [considered as] her permission.&quot; [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, &amp; Others]

It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid; the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.

===Fornicators===
Islam does not give fornicatorous men the right to marry a chaste woman, nor may a fornicatorous woman marry a chaste man, except if the matter has not gone to court and the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.
===Other===
A woman or man may propose marriage directly or through an intermediary (matchmaker).

Homosexual marriage between Muslims is not recognized within Islamic law, based on explicit verses of the Qur&#x27;an and the traditional view of homosexual practices as illicit.

Wedding rings were not widespread across Muslim cultures in antiquity; however, many Muslims today have adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding band alongside other practices originated from European tradition.

===Mahr===

Mahr is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride. Unlike a bride price, however, it is given directly to the bride and not to her father. Although the gift is often money, it can be anything agreed upon by bride and groom such as a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she chooses.

===Islamic marriage contract===

A Muslim marriage is not a &quot;sacrament&quot;, but a simple, legal agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions. These conditions are stipulated in a written contract. Violating any of the conditions stipulated in this contract is legal grounds for a partner seeking divorce. The first part of the &quot;Nikah&quot;, &quot;marriage ceremony&quot;, is the signing of the marriage contract itself.

Various traditions may differ in how Nikah is performed because different groups accept different texts as authoritative. Therefore, Sunnis will likely accept the hadith of Muhammad al-Bukhari, while Shia will have their own collections, for example Furu al-Kafi, thus producing different procedures. This contract requires the consent of both parties. There is a tradition, outside of the religion, in some Muslim countries to pre-arrange a marriage for young children. However, the marriage still requires consent for the wedding to legally take place.

Divorce is not forbidden as a last resort, but the dissolution of the contract Talaq, is often described as the most disliked of permissible things in Islam and should be used as a last resort.

==Walima==

The Walima is a dinner given by the groom&#x27;s side of the family to celebrate the welcoming of the bride to the family. It is a strong sunnah (the repetition of an action of Muhammad) and it is recommended to be held the earliest possible day after the Nikah.

==Behavior within marriage==

===Spousal rights and obligations===

Islam advocates a role-based relationship between husband and wife.

Abd Allah ibn Umar narrated:
It puts the main responsibility of earning over the husband. Both are obliged to fulfill the other&#x27;s sexual needs. Both are obliged to treat each other with kindness.

====Separate accommodation for wife====
The wife has the right to live in separate accommodation with her husband and children, if she does not want to share it with anyone like her in-law or relatives. This is the view of most of the Hanafi, Shaafa&#x27;i and Hanbali fuqaha. She also has the right to refuse to live with her husband&#x27;s father, mother and siblings.

Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: That he heard Allah&#x27;s Apostle saying, &quot;Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband&#x27;s house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master&#x27;s property and is responsible for his charge.&quot; I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet also said, &quot;A man is a guardian of his father&#x27;s property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges.&quot; [Sahih Bukhari]

This indicates that a wife is responsible for the house of her husband. Also that a man should be the guardian of his family, i.e., after his marriage he moves out of his father&#x27;s house, and runs his own family affairs and is guardian of his family. In a joint family, typically the head is either the father of the husband, or mother of the husband. This also indicates that a husband should look after his parents&#x27; house, as &quot;a man is a guardian of his father&#x27;s property&quot;. So the wife should not object to her husband when he is looking after affairs of his parents.

====Sexuality====

Sexuality in Islam is largely described by the Qur&#x27;an, Islamic tradition, and religious leaders both past and present as being confined to marital relationships between men and women. While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty (see haya) with regards to any relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived within Islam (encompassing a swath of life more broad than strictly sex) is to be reserved for marriage.

Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ud narrated:
While adulterous relationships are strictly forbidden, permissible sexual relationships within marriage are described in Islamic sources as great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Sexual relationship between married couples are even source of rewards from God as doing the opposite, i.e., satisfying sexual needs through illicit means, has punishment. Specific occasions (most notably daytime fasting (see sawm) and menstruation) are times forbidden for intercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one another. Anal sex with one&#x27;s wife is also strictly prohibited.

Islam has an open and playful approach to sex so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery.

===Gender roles===
The Qur&#x27;an asserts that there are innate differences between women and men. Therefore, Islam places different rights over the husband and wife.

Some similar rights which both the husband and wife owe to each other are:
* The right to enjoy each other.
* The right to inherit from each other.
* The right of confirmation of the lineage of their children.

Some rights which the husband owes to his wife are:

To treat her like an equal human being.

Some rights which the wife owes to her husband are:

* Being head of the household
* To be obeyed in all that is not disobedience to Allah
* Marital relations
* That she not allow anyone in the house of whom he disapproves
* That she not leave the house without his permission
* That she protect his property
* To be thanked for his efforts
* That she can only undertake a voluntary fast with his permission

These are some of the rights which spouses owe one another.

<text>Innovation and Its Discontents: How Our Broken Patent System Is Endangering Innovation and Progress, and What To Do About It is a book () by Adam B. Jaffe and Josh Lerner. Princeton University Press published the book in 2004.

The authors of the book outline changes made to the patent system in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s which they say has led to a situation in which patents have become extremely powerful economic weapons, and are being issued irresponsibly and at an unreasonable rate.

The result, the authors claim, is that American innovation is being stifled unintentionally as a result of a few simple bureaucratic changes (centralizing the appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and making patent application fees the primary source of revenue for the United States Patent and Trademark Office). The authors argue that the establishment of the CAFC has led to judicial &quot;tunnel vision&quot;; because the judges of the CAFC are only asked to rule on matters of intellectual property, they come to value the current patent system too highly, and tend to side disproportionately with patent-holders.

The authors frame the current debate about patents in historical terms, citing both times when patents were freely granted as royal favors, such as the Elizabethan era in England, as well as times when patents were impossible to obtain, or in the case of the Netherlands in the 1830s, completely abolished.

<text>Kneph, also as Kmeph, is a god and motif of divinity in ancient Egyptian religious art, variously represented as a winged egg, a globe surrounded by one or more serpents, or Amun in the form of a serpent called Kematef. Some Theosophical sources tried to syncretize this motif with the deity Khnum, along with Agathos Daimon, Serapis and Pluto. Under the Greek theonym Chnuphis, this figure adopts a serpent-bodied, lion-headed (&quot;leontoeidic&quot;) visage, being particularly common in magical artifacts in Late Antiquity. It is by proxy frequently associated with the Gnostic Demiurge.

<text>Terra Transport (TT) was the name for the &quot;Newfoundland Transportation Division&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian National Railway (CN), created in 1979 as a means to organize the company&#x27;s operations on Newfoundland.

==Background==

Canadian National Railways acquired the Newfoundland Railway from the Government of Newfoundland in 1949 under that dominion&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Union&quot; of entry into Confederation. The majority of the Newfoundland Railway&#x27;s operations were not economically self-sustaining, requiring significant subsidization; however, it was only after the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway across the island in the early 1960s that the railway began to see serious declines in traffic.

At the same time, CN took over the Newfoundland Railway&#x27;s ferry service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland, and promptly began to improve the service, bringing in vessels dedicated to carrying automobiles and trucks throughout the 1950s–1970s.

By the early 1970s, CN faced increased scrutiny from federal politicians complaining about the railway&#x27;s continuous losses. Successive federal governments of the period had frequently forced the company to undertake various endeavours in the national interest, often at the expense of business and economic logic. As a result, CN sought to restructure itself, placing many of these operations into separate subsidiaries to clarify the accounting behind their existence. Restructuring applied to operations which lost money and required subsidization, or which were not part of CN&#x27;s core freight railway business.

In 1977, all east coast ferries operated by CN were transferred to a new CN Subsidiary, CN Marine. Passenger rail services were transferred to the new Crown corporation, Via Rail, and in 1979, all of CN&#x27;s freight railway operations on Newfoundland, along with the CN Roadcruiser Bus service and CN&#x27;s trucking operation, were placed into a new division named Terra Transport.

==CN on Newfoundland==
CN&#x27;s operations on Newfoundland revolved around the former Newfoundland Railway, which was the longest narrow-gauge railway in North America, stretching approximately 1000 km across the island, from the ferry terminal in Port aux Basques to the provincial capital at St. John&#x27;s. Many of the island&#x27;s largest communities developed along the main line, largely because of their location; as a result, the Trans-Canada Highway paralleled its route in many places.

Rail operations in Newfoundland remained economically unfeasible because of slow service times, a side effect of the narrow-gauge format. CN invested heavily in track improvements during the 1950s-1960s, but the narrow-gauge operation could not compete with the flexibility of trucks. Significant time was lost at Port aux Basques, where standard-gauge railway cars from mainland North America were lifted off their bogies and onto narrow-gauge bogies for use on Newfoundland. In some cases this was not possible, and the rail car contents were unloaded and reloaded onto narrow-gauge cars. CN&#x27;s operation of dedicated railway car ferries was an additional expense.

CN operated a main line passenger train, the &quot;Caribou&quot;, from St. John&#x27;s to Port aux Basques. Nicknamed the &quot;Newfie Bullet&quot;, the &quot;Caribou&quot; operated until June 1969, when it was replaced by the CN Roadcruiser bus service started in the Fall of 1968. With the demise of the &quot;Caribou&quot;, the only passenger services remaining on the island were mixed freight and passenger trains on the Bonavista, Carbonear, and Argentia branch lines, and on the main-line between Bishop&#x27;s Falls and Corner Brook. Terra Transport would continue to operate mixed passenger/freight service on the branch lines until 1984. The mainline service between Corner Brook and Bishop&#x27;s Falls made its last run on 30 September 1988. The Roadcruiser bus service ran until 29 March 1996, when it was sold to DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland.

The most significant change made under the Terra Transport subsidiary was the move to the carriage of less-than-carload (LCL) freight. A large fleet of distinctive green intermodal shipping containers were ordered and used in place of boxcars. These containers were stacked on flatcars of mainland trains, fitted onto the decks inside the ferries, and then placed on flatcars of trains in Newfoundland, or transported entirely by truck. During the mid-1980s, trains composed almost entirely of the distinctive TT containers were common. The handling time for freight dropped considerably, as containers could be easily removed from the trains in each community and the loading/unloading at Port aux Basques was significantly improved over standard freight cars. Another significant change the closure and abandonment all of CN&#x27;s branch lines in the province by 1984, leaving only the main line operational.

Despite these changes, Terra Transport was unable to turn a profit for CN and the federal government. Specialized ferries were still needed for carrying non-LCL railway cars, and by the mid-1980s were approaching the end of their operational life and required replacement. The election of a Conservative federal government brought about the elimination of subsidies for money-losing operations. In 1986, one of two remaining railcar ferries was sold off as the government converted CN Marine into Marine Atlantic, completely separating the rail and ferry services. Terra Transport operations were largely captive on Newfoundland and would specialize in handling import/export LCL and inter-island non-LCL freight.

==Abandonment==

In 1987, the federal government deregulated the railway industry in Canada and CN promptly applied to abandon its Newfoundland operations under Terra Transport. The political firestorm which followed saw the federal and provincial governments negotiate a one-time payout of $800 million (CAD) from Ottawa to St. John&#x27;s to fund highway improvements under the &quot;Trans-Canada Highway Program&quot; and the &quot;Regional Trunk Road Agreement&quot;.

The agreements were signed in December 1987; however, continuing public outcry and legal challenges kept the railway operational for several months. On 20 June 1988, it was officially announced that the railway would cease operations as of 1 September 1988. Some freight trains still ran until late September, with the last scheduled run on 29 September 1988. The last scheduled passenger train ran on 30 September 1988, from Bishops Falls to Corner Brook. Following official abandonment, the railway operated salvage trains, dismantling track in remote locations; some salvage trains were still operating in the summer of 1990. Most of the track was removed and scrapped by November 1990. CN no longer has any operations in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

Since 1997, the old railbed has been reclaimed as the Newfoundland T&#x27;Railway Provincial Park.

<text>Wood Street is a station on the Weaver line of the London Overground, located in Upper Walthamstow in the London Borough of Waltham Forest. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street on the Chingford branch line. The station is in Travelcard Zone 4, and is situated close to Whipps Cross University Hospital.
Its three-letter station code is WST.

==History==
The station was opened in 1873 by the Great Eastern Railway.

On 13 February 1919 there was an accident at Wood Street when a passenger train ran into an empty stock train. Five people were injured – none seriously. The cause was a signal failure.

In 1923 the Great Eastern Railway became part of the London and North Eastern Railway, which in turn was merged into British Railways Eastern Region following nationalisation in 1948.

When construction of the London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line was given parliamentary approval in 1955, the plan was to build the line past Walthamstow Central station to Wood Street, where the line would surface to terminate next to the British Railways station, on land previously used as a coal depot. Before construction work started, a decision was made in 1961 to omit the section beyond Walthamstow Central.

The line was electrified in 1960, and electric services commenced on 12 November. At first Class 305 EMUs were used, but initial technical problems led to their replacement by Class 302 and Class 304 EMUs.

The station had a goods depot, which closed on 6 May 1968.

In April 1994 Railtrack took over responsibility for the operation of the infrastructure. Train services have been operated since then by West Anglia Great Northern, National Express East Anglia, Abellio Greater Anglia and, , by London Overground.

===Engine shed===
There was an engine shed located just north of Wood Street which was a sub-shed of Stratford TMD and was built in 1878. The engine shed was a two road affair with space for 6 tank locomotives – there was also a short siding for coal wagons. An additional siding was added c1934. By the 1950s the staff complement was 36 drivers, 36 Firemen and six Passed Cleaners although recruitment for what was a hard dirty job became more difficult during that decade.

On 1 January 1922 the allocation consisted of three GER Class M15 2-4-2Ts (later LNER Class F4), two GER Class C72 (later LNER Class J68) and eleven GER Class S56 (later LNER class J69) 0-6-0T engines.

In later years the main allocation of the shed was tank engines for working suburban services to and from London Liverpool Street and from the 1920s the allocation was exclusively the LNER N7 0-6-2T locomotives.

The shed was closed in 1960 when the line was electrified.

==Services==
Trains are operated as part of the Weaver line of the London Overground.

The typical off-peak weekday service pattern is:
*4 trains per hour (tph) to London Liverpool Street;
*4 tph to Chingford.

Journey times are 9 minutes to Chingford and 20 minutes to Liverpool Street.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 230 and W16 serve the station.

<text>The House of Gorchakov, or Gortchakoff (), is a Russian noble family claiming descent from Michael of Chernigov, although it did not gain prominence until the 18th century.

==Aleksey Gorchakov==

The family first achieved prominence during the reign of Catherine II. Prince Aleksey Ivanovich (1769–1817) served with distinction under his uncle Suvorov in the Turkish Wars, and took part as a general officer in the Italian and Swiss operations of 1799, and in the war against Napoleon in Poland in 1806–1807 (Battle of Heilsberg). He succeeded Barclay de Tolly as the Minister of War in 1813. His brother Andrei Ivanovich Gorchakov (1776–1855) was a general in the Russian army who took a conspicuous part in the final campaigns against Napoleon.

==Pyotr Gorchakov==

Prince Peter Dmitrievich Gorchakov (1790–1868) served under Mikhail Kamensky and Mikhail Kutuzov in the campaign against Turkey, and afterwards against France in 1813–1814. In 1820 he suppressed an insurrection in the Caucasus, for which service he was raised to the rank of major-general. In 1828–1829 he fought under Prince Peter von Wittgenstein against the Turks, won an action at Aidos, and signed the treaty of peace at Adrianople. In 1839 he was made governor of Eastern Siberia, and in 1851 retired into private life.

When the Crimean War broke out he offered his services to the emperor Nicholas, by whom he was appointed general of the VI army corps in the Crimea. He commanded the corps in the battles of Alma and Inkerman. He retired in 1855 and died at Moscow, on March 18, 1868.

==Mikhail Gorchakov==
Prince Mikhail Dmitrievich (1795–1861), brother of the last named, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian troops which occupied Moldavia and Wallachia after the outbreak of the Crimean War. In 1854 he crossed the Danube and besieged Silistria, but was superseded in April by Prince Ivan Paskevich, who, however, resigned on June 8, when Gorchakov resumed the command.

In 1855 Gorchakov was appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian forces in the Crimea in place of the disgraced Prince Menshikov. Gorchakov&#x27;s defence of Sevastopol, and final retreat to the northern part of the town, which he continued to defend till peace was signed in Paris, were conducted with lack of energy. In 1856 he was appointed governor-general of Poland in succession to Prince Paskevich. He died at Warsaw on May 30, 1861, and was buried, in accordance with his own wish, at Sevastopol.

== Alexander Gorchakov ==

Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov (1798–1883) served as Chancellor of the Russian Empire (in office from 1867) during the reign of Emperor Alexander II (). He was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where he had the poet Alexander Pushkin as a school-fellow. In 1820–22 he accompanied Foreign Minister Karl Nesselrode to the Holy Alliance congresses at Troppau, Laibach, and Vienna.

Gorchakov was appointed Foreign Minister in April 1856 soon after the end of the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856; he represented the Russian Empire at the Paris Congress of 1856. His main objective was to restore Russia&#x27;s international prestige after the bitter defeat. At first he steered the country towards an alliance with Napoleon III of France, but rebuffed by the latter&#x27;s support of the January Uprising in Poland, joined his archrival Otto von Bismarck in setting up the League of the Three Emperors in 1873. Following France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, Gorchakov succeeded in his long-term goal or revising the key clauses of the Paris Treaty, especially those containing Russia&#x27;s interests in the Black Sea.

The aged chancellor was so disgusted by the modification of the Treaty of San Stefano at the Berlin Congress of 1878 that in 1882 he laid down all his offices and settled into retirement. He died some months later.

== In popular culture ==
The Gorchakov family play a central role in &quot;1636: The Kremlin Games&quot; and other works in the Russian thread of the &quot;1632&quot; alternate history science fiction series.

<text>In mathematics, the Legendre chi function is a special function whose Taylor series is also a Dirichlet series, given by
formula_1

As such, it resembles the Dirichlet series for the polylogarithm, and, indeed, is trivially expressible in terms of the polylogarithm as
formula_2

The Legendre chi function appears as the discrete Fourier transform, with respect to the order ν, of the Hurwitz zeta function, and also of the Euler polynomials, with the explicit relationships given in those articles.

The Legendre chi function is a special case of the Lerch transcendent, and is given by 
formula_3

<text>Katarina-Sofia was a borough (&quot;stadsdelsområde&quot;) in central Stockholm, named after the two parishes of Katarina and Sofia. Effective January 1, 2007, the borough merged with the borough of Maria-Gamla Stan to form the Södermalm borough.

Katarina-Sofia was made up of the eastern half of Södermalm and Hammarby Sjöstad (Södra Hammarbyhamnen). The population was 42,750 on an area of 3.36 km², which gave a density of 12,723.21/km².</text><links>

<doc id="1269908" wikidata="Q5051301" url="?curid=1269908" title="Catallaxy">
<text>Catallaxy or [[catallactics]] is an alternative expression for the word &quot;economy&quot;. Whereas the word economy suggests that people in a community possess a common and congruent set of values and goals, catallaxy suggests that the emergent properties of a market (prices, division of labor, growth, etc.) are the outgrowths of the diverse and disparate goals of the individuals in a community.

Aristotle was the first person to define the word &quot;economy&quot; as ‘the art of household management’. As is still a common method of explanation today, Aristotle tried to explain complex market phenomena through an analogy between a household and a state, take for example the modern analogy between the national debt of a country&#x27;s government and a simple consumer&#x27;s credit card debt. Aristotle used a common Greek word &#x27;oikonomia&#x27; that meant &quot;to direct a single household,&quot; and used it to mean the management of an entire city-state. The word catallaxy aims to provide a more accurate and inclusive word for the market phenomenon of groups of households, in which participants are free to pursue diverse ends of their own.

After being discussed by Ludwig von Mises the term catallaxy was later made popular by Friedrich Hayek who defines it as &quot;the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market&quot;.

Catallaxy may also be used to refer to a marketplace of ideas, especially a place where people holding diverse political ideologies come together to gain deeper understanding of a wide range of political orientations.

Catallaxy also becomes a new dimension in software design and network architecture.

<text>Giuseppe LaMotta (April 27, 1925 – December 29, 2020), better known as Joey LaMotta, was an American boxer who was the younger brother and one time manager of former world middleweight boxing champion, Jake LaMotta.

LaMotta also boxed for a short time in 1945 and 1946. His record was 32 wins (22 KOs), 5 losses (1 KO), and 2 draws.

Joe Pesci was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Joey in the 1980 film &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, a biographical film about his brother Jake&#x27;s turbulent life and career.

His son, John LaMotta was an actor and also an amateur boxer who fought in the heavyweight-novice class of the 2001 Golden Gloves championship tournament.

LaMotta died on December 29, 2020, at the age of 95.

<doc id="1269912" wikidata="Q421429" url="?curid=1269912" title="Nimodipine">
<text>Nimodipine, sold under the brand name Nimotop among others, is a calcium channel blocker used in preventing vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage (a form of cerebral hemorrhage). It was originally developed within the calcium channel blocker class as it was used for the treatment of high blood pressure, but is not used for this indication. 
It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in the US in 1988. It was approved for medical use in Germany in 1985.

==Medical use==
Because it has some selectivity for cerebral vasculature, nimodipine&#x27;s main use is in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and resultant ischemia, a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (a form of cerebral bleed), specifically from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms irrespective of the patient&#x27;s post-ictus neurological condition. Its administration begins within 4 days of a subarachnoid hemorrhage and is continued for three weeks. If blood pressure drops by over 5%, dosage is adjusted. There is still controversy regarding the use of intravenous nimodipine on a routine basis.

A 2003 trial (Belfort &quot;et al.&quot;) found nimodipine was inferior to magnesium sulfate in preventing seizures in women with severe preeclampsia.

Nimodipine is not regularly used to treat head injury. Several investigations have been performed evaluating its use for traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage; a systematic review of 4 trials did not suggest any significant benefit to the patients that receive nimodipine therapy. There was one report case of nimodipine being successfully used for treatment of ultradian bipolar cycling after brain injury and, later, amygdalohippocampectomy.

===Dosage===
The regular dosage is 60 mg tablets every four hours. If the patient is unable to take tablets orally, it was previously given via intravenous infusion at a rate of 1–2 mg/hour (lower dosage if the body weight is &lt;70 kg or blood pressure is too low), but since the withdrawal of the IV preparation, administration by nasogastric tube is an alternative.

==Contraindications==
Nimodipine is associated with low blood pressure, flushing and sweating, edema, nausea and other gastrointestinal problems, most of which are known characteristics of calcium channel blockers. It is contraindicated in unstable angina or an episode of myocardial infarction more recently than one month.

While nimodipine was occasionally administered intravenously in the past, the FDA released an alert in January 2006, warning that it had received reports of the approved oral preparation being used intravenously, leading to severe complications; this was despite warnings on the box that this should not be done.

==Side-effects==
The FDA has classified the side effects into groups based on dosages levels at q4h. For the high dosage group (90 mg) less than 1% of the group experienced adverse conditions including itching, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, neurological deterioration, vomiting, diaphoresis, congestive heart failure, hyponatremia, decreasing platelet count, disseminated intravascular coagulation, deep vein thrombosis.

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
After oral administration, it reaches peak plasma concentrations within one and a half hours. Patients taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants have lower plasma concentrations, while patients taking sodium valproate were markedly higher.

===Metabolism===
Nimodipine is metabolized in the first pass metabolism. The dihydropyridine ring of the nimodipine is dehydrogenated in the hepatic cells of the liver, a process governed by cytochrome P450 isoform 3A (CYP3A). This can be completely inhibited however, by troleandomycin (an antibiotic) or ketoconazole (an antifungal drug).

===Excretion===
Studies in non-human mammals using radioactive labeling have found that 40–50% of the dose is excreted via urine. The residue level in the body was never more than 1.5% in monkeys.

==Mode of action==
Nimodipine binds specifically to -type voltage-gated calcium channels. There are numerous theories about its mechanism in preventing vasospasm, but none are conclusive.

Nimodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid.

==Synthesis==

The key acetoacetate (2) for the synthesis of nimodipine (5) is obtained by alkylation of sodium acetoacetate with 2-methoxyethyl chloride, Aldol condensation of &quot;meta&quot;-nitrobenzene (1) and the subsequent reaction of the intermediate with enamine (4) gives nimodipine.

==Stereochemistry==
Nimodipine contains a stereocenter and can exist as either of two enantiomers. The pharmaceutical drug is a racemate, an equal mixture of the (&quot;R&quot;)- and (&quot;S&quot;)- forms.

<text>Gola is a sporting goods brand based in England. It was founded on 22 May 1905. It used to be known as the Bozeat Boot Company, and was based in the Northamptonshire village of Bozeat.

==Overview==
The company produces mainly track suits and trainers, of which the models known as &quot;Harrier&quot; and &quot;Chase&quot; are particularly popular, especially in continental Europe. During the 1970s, Gola&#x27;s licensing was held under Electronic Rentals Group and its principal chairman, Maurice Fry and Leisure Group Managing Director Alan Christopher Cowell who also ran Camping Gaz. ERG PLC pushed several million pounds into Gola and developed the Gola Bag of 1972 which created an international craze.

Gola was purchased by the Jacobson Group in 1996 and has since expanded its range. In the early 2000s, Gola sportswear was re-launched in the UK as a &#x27;retro&#x27; sports fashion brand, selling to the same people, now grown up, who fondly remembered the brand from their childhood – but at premium prices.

Gola sponsored the Alliance Premier League, the highest level of English non-League football, from 1984 until 1986, during which time the league was known as the Gola League.

<doc id="1269917" wikidata="Q5672985" url="?curid=1269917" title="Harry V. Jaffa">
<text>Harry Victor Jaffa (October 7, 1918 – January 10, 2015) was an American political philosopher, historian, columnist, and professor. He was a professor emeritus at Claremont McKenna College, Claremont Graduate University, and was a distinguished fellow of the Claremont Institute. Robert P. Kraynak says his &quot;life work was to develop an American application of Leo Strauss&#x27;s revival of natural-right philosophy against the relativism and nihilism of our times&quot;.

Jaffa wrote on topics ranging from Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas to Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, and natural law. He was published in the &quot;Claremont Review of Books&quot;, the &quot;Review of Politics&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and the &quot;New York Times&quot;. His most famous work, &quot;Crisis of the House Divided: An Interpretation of the Issues in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates&quot;, written in 1959, has been described as a touchstone. He wrote the controversial line in 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater&#x27;s acceptance speech that &quot;extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice&quot;.

Jaffa was a formative influence on the American conservative movement, challenging notable conservative thinkers, including Russell Kirk, Richard M. Weaver, and Willmoore Kendall, on Abraham Lincoln and the founding of the United States. He debated Robert Bork on American constitutionalism. He died in 2015.
==Early life and education==

Jaffa was born in New York City on October 7, 1918, to Arthur Solomon Jaffa and Frances Landau Jaffa; his middle name is a reference to World War I, which ended with the same year he was born. His family was Jewish. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature from Yale University and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in political philosophy from The New School for Social Research. As a PhD student, he became interested in Abraham Lincoln after discovering a copy of the Lincoln–Douglas debates in a used bookshop.

Jaffa was one of Leo Strauss&#x27; first PhD students. His dissertation on Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas later became his first book, &quot;Thomism and Aristotelianism&quot;. There, he argues that the Christian beliefs of Aquinas influenced Aquinas&#x27; work on Aristotle. Alasdair MacIntyre describes the book as &quot;an unduly neglected minor modern classic.&quot;

==Career and views==
Jaffa taught at Queens College, City College of New York, and the University of Chicago in the 1940s before receiving his doctorate. He taught at Ohio State University from 1951 through 1964, before moving to Claremont McKenna College.

Jaffa was known for his involvement in politics in addition to his writings. He was a &quot;Kennedy Democrat who switched parties after the Bay of Pigs&quot; in the 1960s, as described by Sam Tanenhaus. During the 1964 presidential election, Jaffa worked for the Republican campaign of Barry Goldwater. Jaffa wrote Goldwater&#x27;s famous and controversial statement in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention: &quot;I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.&quot;

At Claremont, Jaffa was known as a leader of the &quot;West Coast Straussians&quot; and the &quot;Claremonsters&quot;. His proteges can be found at Claremont and other colleges including Hillsdale College and the University of Dallas. United States Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has said Jaffa influenced his judicial views.

===Founding of the United States===
Jaffa believed the American founders, including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington established the nation on political principles traceable from Locke to Aristotle. While he believed that governments are instituted to protect rights, he acknowledged the higher ends they serve, primarily happiness. The Declaration of Independence said, &quot;whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness], it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.&quot; Jaffa pointed out that safety and happiness are the principal virtues of Aristotelian political life in his &quot;Politics&quot;. Jaffa also pointed to Federalist No. 43, in which James Madison declares that safety and happiness are the aims of all political institutions, and George Washington&#x27;s first inaugural address as cementing the link between human happiness and government and therefore the ancient roots of the American founding.

===Abraham Lincoln scholarship===
Jaffa wrote two books dealing exclusively with Abraham Lincoln. His first, &quot;Crisis of the House Divided: An Interpretation of the Issues in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates,&quot; was written in 1959. Forty years later, he followed it with &quot;A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War.&quot; Jaffa also wrote a number of essays on Lincoln for the &quot;National Review&quot; and other journals. Before Jaffa, most conservative scholars, including M. E. Bradford, Russell Kirk, and Willmoore Kendall believed that Lincoln&#x27;s presidency represented a substantial growth in federal power and limitation on individual rights.

Jaffa also believed that the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution share a relationship whereby the latter is intended to preserve the principles of the former. This belief has garnered criticism from legal scholars, particularly Robert Bork.

====&quot;Crisis of the House Divided&quot;====

In &quot;Crisis of the House Divided&quot;, Jaffa discusses the Lincoln–Douglas debates that occurred on the eve of the American Civil War. During the 1850s, concern over the spread of slavery into the territories and into the free states became the primary concern of American politics. Stephen A. Douglas proposed the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which removed congressional authority over slavery&#x27;s expansion into the territories and allowed the citizens of each territory to decide whether or not slavery would be legal there. In contrast, Lincoln believed that popular sovereignty was another example of tyranny of the majority. Lincoln argued that a majority could not sanction the enslavement of other men due to the Founding principle that &quot;All men are created equal,&quot; which slavery violated. Both men squared off in a contest for Illinois&#x27; Senate seat in 1858.

In the book, Jaffa explains the philosophical underpinnings of both Lincoln and Douglas&#x27; arguments. According to Catherine H. Zuckert, Jaffa &quot;aimed at nothing less than bringing to bear on America the methods and substance of the Straussian revival of the Socratic tradition of political philosophy.&quot; Like Strauss, Jaffa observed the tendency of modernity to degenerate moral and political philosophy, which he found in Douglas&#x27; appeal to popular sovereignty. Jaffa also believed that Lincoln challenged Douglas&#x27; argument with an Aristotelian or classical philosophical position derived from the Declaration of Independence and its contention that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Sam Tanenhaus described the book as &quot;a touchstone in the vast Lincoln literature&quot; and wrote that &quot;Lincoln emerges from it as a serious moral philosopher&quot;.

====&quot;A New Birth of Freedom&quot;====
&quot;A New Birth of Freedom&quot; was to be the first of a projected two-volume commentary on the Gettysburg Address. The first volume focuses on Lincoln&#x27;s First Inaugural Address and his July 4, 1861, address to Congress. Jaffa argues that the Gettysburg Address is not a self-contained work but &quot;a speech within a drama. It can no more be interpreted apart from the drama than, let us say, a speech by Hamlet or MacBeth can be interpreted apart from Hamlet or MacBeth. The Gettysburg Address is a speech within the tragedy of the Civil War, even as Lincoln is its tragic hero. The Civil War is itself an outcome of tragic flaws—birthmarks, so to speak—of the infant nation.&quot;

Jaffa describes human equality as America&#x27;s &quot;ancient faith&quot; and contends that the Declaration of Independence reflects the principles of natural law. According to Jaffa, Lincoln&#x27;s task was to restore America&#x27;s political faith, saving the Union from the historicism of the Confederacy. Jaffa considers the political philosophy of John C. Calhoun the backbone of the Confederacy&#x27;s new constitution and its notion of human inequality. According to him, Calhoun believed that equality was only a prescriptive attribute on the part of the states, not a natural right of human persons. By extension, Calhoun believes that human equality is derived from the relationship between equal states and not equal persons. Jaffa therefore believes that Calhoun&#x27;s understanding of equality differs greatly from the American founders.

===Debating Lincoln===
Jaffa debated many conservative and libertarian critics of Abraham Lincoln. In the mid-1960s, he argued for Lincoln&#x27;s conservative legacy in the pages of &quot;National Review&quot; with Frank Meyer, who maintained that Lincoln opened the door to unlimited expansion of federal power. In his book, &quot;Storm Over the Constitution&quot; (1999), he formulated a theory of constitutional law, incorporating the Declaration of Independence. The theory was criticized for being overly philosophical, rather than legal, despite being presented as a legal argument. His approach was especially critical of figures such as William Rehnquist and Robert Bork, who responded to Jaffa in &quot;National Review&quot;.

Jaffa also criticized the scholarship of other prominent conservatives including Russell Kirk, Richard Weaver, M.E. Bradford, and Willmoore Kendall. He debated libertarian Lincoln critic Thomas DiLorenzo in 2002.

===Criticism of Robert Bork===
Jaffa argued that former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork advanced a theory of American constitutionalism that was in fundamental tension with the principles of the Declaration of Independence, and that was insufficiently conservative. Jaffa argued that Bork&#x27;s argument represented legal positivism and moral relativism akin to that expressed by John C. Calhoun and the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to Jaffa, Bork believed that the Constitution and the Declaration were separate documents that were never intended to inform one another. Bork argued that the Constitution said nothing about abortion or gay rights. Jaffa believed that the Constitution followed natural law principles, and therefore &quot;prohibited&quot; states from protecting abortion or homosexuality. Bork replied that Jaffa&#x27;s theories amounted to &quot;the heart&#x27;s desire theory of constitutional jurisprudence: Anything one does not like is in the Constitution&quot;, and that those who agreed with him &quot;had much in common with Harry Blackmun, although neither would care to admit it.&quot;

===&quot;National Review&quot;===
Jaffa was close friends with William F. Buckley, publishing a number of articles on Lincoln in &quot;National Review&quot; throughout his career. He credited Buckley with allowing him to publish when he had been blacklisted by liberal journals and neoconservative publications after a dispute with Irving Kristol. However, Jaffa disagreed with many of the writers then publishing for the magazine including Russell Kirk and Frank Meyer. According to him, these men and other writers there rejected the principles of the Declaration of Independence and its main contention that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; Jaffa spent his lifetime stressing the importance of the Declaration to conservatives and liberals alike.

===Barry Goldwater campaign===
During the 1964 presidential campaign, Jaffa, who was serving as a speechwriter to Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, penned the line, &quot;Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and moderation in the pursuit of justice is not a virtue&quot; in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination. Although Goldwater claimed repeatedly that the line originated in a speech by Cicero, it appears nowhere in Cicero&#x27;s works, and was in fact authored by Jaffa.

==Death==
Jaffa died at Pomona Valley Hospital on January 10, 2015, the same day as his fellow Straussian and rival Walter Berns.

==Personal life==
Jaffa married Marjorie Butler in 1942; she died in 2010. They had three children, Donald, Philip, and Karen.

<text>The Nordwestblock (German, &quot;Northwest Block&quot;) is a hypothetical Northwestern European cultural region that some scholars propose as a prehistoric culture in the present-day Netherlands, Belgium, far-northern France, and northwestern Germany, in an area approximately bounded by the Somme, Oise, Meuse and Elbe rivers, possibly extending to the eastern part of what is now England, during the Bronze and Iron Ages from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BCE, up to the onset of historical sources, in the 1st century BCE.

The theory was first proposed by two authors working independently: Hans Kuhn and Maurits Gysseling, whose proposal included research indicating that another language may have existed somewhere in between Germanic and Celtic in the Belgian region.

The term &quot;Nordwestblock&quot; itself was coined by Hans Kuhn, who considered the inhabitants of the area neither Germanic nor Celtic and so attributed to the people a distinct ethnicity or culture up to the Iron Age. So far, this has not been proven or disproven.

== Language hypotheses ==
The hypothetical language or languages spoken by the Iron Age Nordwestblock population are a matter of speculation, as there are no written records of such languages as is the case with the Germanic language, but can be inferred based on analysis of substrate features in the primarily West Germanic languages that later came to be spoken in the region (for example, areal loanwords of unknown origin, and the presence of certain geminate consonants that cannot be explained by inheritance from Proto-Indo-European), or by analysis of place-names (toponymy and hydronymy). Broadly, this substrate area is sometimes called the North-West European substratum. Kuhn speculated on linguistic affinity of this substratum to the Venetic language, while other hypotheses connect the Northwestblock with the Rhaetic (&quot;Tyrsenian&quot;) or generic Indo-European languages of the centum type (Illyrian, &quot;Old European&quot;). Gysseling suspected an intermediate Belgian language between Germanic and Celtic, that might have been affiliated to Italic. According to Luc van Durme, a Belgian linguist, toponymic evidence of a former Celtic presence in the Low Countries is almost completely absent. Kuhn noted that since, in Proto-Indo-European (PIE), the phoneme * was very rare, and since PIE *, via Grimm&#x27;s law, is the main source of regularly inherited in words in Germanic languages (except after fricatives, e.g. initial &quot;*sp-&quot; from PIE &quot;*(s)p-&quot;), the many words in which occurs must have some other language as their source. Similarly, in Celtic, PIE * disappeared and in regularly-inherited words did not reappear in p-Celtic languages except as a result of Proto-Celtic &quot;*kʷ&quot; becoming &quot;*p&quot;. All that taken together means that any word starting with a in a Germanic language that is not evidently borrowed from either Latin or a p-Celtic language, such as Gaulish, must be a loan from another language. Kuhn ascribes those words to the Nordwestblock language.

Linguist Peter Schrijver assumes the pre-existence of pre-Indo-European languages linked to the archeological Linear Pottery culture and to a family of languages featuring complex verbs, of which the Northwest Caucasian languages might have been the sole survivors. Although assumed to have left traces within all other Indo-European languages as well, the influence of an unknown substrate would have been especially strong on Celtic languages originating north of the Alps and on the region including Belgium and the Rhineland.

It is uncertain when Germanic began to gain a foothold in the area. The Nordwestblock region north of the Rhine is traditionally conceived as belonging to the realms of the Northern Bronze Age, with the Harpstedt Iron Age generally assumed to represent the Germanic precedents west of the Jastorf culture. The general development converged with the emergence of Germanic within other previously Northern Bronze Age regions to the east, maybe also involving a certain degree of Germanic cultural diffusion. From about the 1st century CE, that region saw the development of the &quot;Weser–Rhine&quot; group of West Germanic dialects which gave rise to Old Frankish from the 4th century.

The issue still remains unresolved and so far no conclusive evidence has been forwarded to support any alternative. Mallory considers the issue a salutary reminder that some anonymous linguistic groups that do not fully obey the current classification may have survived to the beginning of historical records.

== Prehistoric composition ==

The following prehistoric cultures have been attributed to the region and are compatible with but do not necessarily prove the Nordwestblock hypothesis.

The Bell Beaker culture (2700–2100 BCE) is thought to originate from the same geographic area, as early stages of the culture apparently derived from early Corded Ware culture elements, with the Netherlands/Rhineland region as probably the most widely accepted site of origin (J. P. Mallory, EIEC p. 53).
The Bell Beaker culture locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BCE). In the 2nd millennium BCE, the region was at the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons, split up in a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the Rhine. To the north emerged the Elp culture (1800-800 BCE), featuring an initial tumulus phase showing a close relationship to other Northern European tumulus groups (sharing pottery of low quality: &quot;Kümmerkeramik&quot;) and a subsequent smooth local transformation to the Urnfield culture (1200–800 BCE). The southern region became dominated by the Hilversum culture (1800–800 BCE), which apparently inherited the previous Barbed Wire Beaker cultural ties with Britain.

From 800 BCE onward, the southern area was influenced by the Celtic or proto-Celtic Hallstatt culture. The current view in the Netherlands holds that subsequent Iron Age innovations did not involve substantial Celtic intrusions but featured a local development from Bronze Age culture.

From 750-600 BCE, areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerged as the probably-Germanic Harpstedt culture west of the Germanic Jastorf culture, and the southern parts became assimilated to the Celtic La Tène culture, as is consistent with Julius Caesar&#x27;s account of the Rhine forming the boundary between Celtic and Germanic tribes.

Later, the Roman retreat resulted in the disappearance of imported products like ceramics and coins and a return to virtually-unchanged local Iron Age production methods. To the north, people continued to live in the same three-aisled farmhouse, and to the east, completely-new types of buildings arose. More to the south, in Belgium, archaeological results of the period point to immigration from the north.

== Roman era ==
With the onset of historical records (Tacitus, 1st century), the area was generally called the border region between Celtic (Gaulish) and Germanic influence.

Tribes located in the area include the Batavians, Belgae, Chatti, Hermunduri, Cheruscii, Salii, Sicambri, Tencteri and Usipetes or Usipii. Caesar took the course of the Rhine to be the boundary between Gauls and Germans (Germanic people) but also mentioned that a large part of the Belgae had ancestry from east of the Rhine and that one part were even known collectively as &quot;Germani&quot; (the so-called &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot;). The Belgae were therefore considered Gaulish (the Usipetes Germanic etc.) because of their position with respect to the Rhine, and not in the modern linguistic sense of the terms.

Some of those tribes would later join the Frankish confederation.

<doc id="1269927" wikidata="Q1753645" url="?curid=1269927" title="Power Metal (album)">
<text>Power Metal is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera, released on June 24, 1988, through Metal Magic Records. It is the first Pantera album to feature Phil Anselmo on lead vocals, as part of Pantera&#x27;s best-known lineup which would last until the band&#x27;s breakup in 2003. 

The album signals a shift in a heavier direction and has been described as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the band&#x27;s original glam metal style and the heavier groove metal sound of their subsequent work. It contains influences from speed and thrash metal while still retaining elements from the band&#x27;s previous releases. The sound of the album has often been compared to that of Judas Priest, in particular Anselmo&#x27;s vocals to that of Rob Halford. 

==Background==
In August 1985, Pantera released &quot;I Am the Night&quot;, the last album with Terry Glaze on vocals. However, in June 1986, tensions arose between Glaze and the band members. He was given a two-week notice, which they hoped would resolve the tension, but left the group. After Glaze&#x27;s departure, they held auditions for a replacement singer. Numerous singers auditioned, most notable Matt L&#x27;Amour (a David Coverdale lookalike), Rick Mythiasin, and David Peacock, who all had short tenures with the band until October 1986. At that time, Pantera had started most of the time writing and working on the songs with all of the three short-lived singers as well as Glaze, but only drum, guitar and bass tracks were filled in entirely. Still desperate for a singer that would fit the group&#x27;s intended heavier style, New Orleans native Phil Anselmo, who the band had met on the road, stepped in to record the album, marking his first appearance with the band. The earliest known tour date with Anselmo on vocals was on November 25, 1986, in Fort Worth, Texas. This would be the band&#x27;s best-known lineup until their dissolution in November 2003.

==Writing==
&quot;Proud to Be Loud&quot; was written and produced by Keel guitarist Marc Ferrari and was originally intended to appear on their 1987 self-titled album; however, Keel would not record their own version until &quot;Keel VI: Back in Action&quot; in 1998. Pantera&#x27;s version was used as the party song in the theatrical cut of the 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, credited to &quot;The Dead Green Mummies&quot;.

Glaze had originally written some of the band&#x27;s lyrics but Anselmo changed most of them except &quot;Down Below&quot;, with an earlier recording of the song appearing on Pantera&#x27;s third album &quot;I Am the Night&quot; (1985) crediting Glaze.

==Release and promotion==
As the record was close to being finished with Anselmo on the vocals, the band was brought in with a contract with Gold Mountain Records, one of the distributors with MCA, primarily based on the band&#x27;s relationship with Marc Ferrari on Keel. Gold Mountain Records executive Danny Goldberg felt that the record was &quot;too heavy&quot;. Drummer Vinnie Paul stated that the label wanted to &quot;change our style and make us sound like Bon Jovi&quot; which the band refused. As a result, the band was forced to release the album through Metal Magic.

&quot;Power Metal&quot; was released in the United States on June 24, 1988. As expected beyond limited promotion and the absence of a major label, the album did not chart. The band wrote new material and recorded demos around early 1989 that would later be included in their first major studio album, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, on July 24, 1990. Atco Records were considering re-issuing the album, &quot;if we sell three million of [Cowboys from Hell]&quot;, Paul stated. Furthermore, right after its release, the group still kept their &quot;Power Metal&quot; album in circulation for their fans, but not on a major scale.

In a Blabbermouth interview with Phil Anselmo in 2013, when asked about possibly reissuing the album, he replied:

In a UK Eonmusic interview with Rex Brown in 2021, he stated that the band, including himself, was against reissuing the album, alongside the earlier albums with Glaze. Brown asserted that he did not &quot;want to give any credit where it&#x27;s fuckin&#x27; undue,&quot; referring to Glaze. The past four glam albums were not considered a part of their history, and do not appear on any digital streaming service, except the song &quot;Proud to be Loud&quot;, was only distributed by Universal Music Group, due to its presence on movie titles.

==Critical reception==
In a retrospective review, Bradley Torreano at AllMusic awarded &quot;Power Metal&quot; 2.5 stars out of 5, noting it as being the culmination of the band&#x27;s first four albums of hair metal. Torreano described it as &quot;an interesting and transitional early effort from one of the most important metal bands of the &#x27;90s.&quot; He criticized the lyrics, remarking that they are &quot;the biggest problem, showing none of the gutter poetry that [Phil] Anselmo would develop through time and instead reflecting a bland interest in all things &#x27;rock&#x27;&quot;. He went on to highlight Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s guitar work, calling it &quot;one of the more charming elements of the band&#x27;s early sound&quot; and that &quot;he was obviously a very talented guitarist even then&quot;.

Asking how Anselmo recalled the album&#x27;s impressions, he said to Revolver:

&quot;LA Weekly&quot; called it one of Pantera&#x27;s best albums, &quot;a solid album of 1980s speed metal&quot;.

<text>The Schutzpolizei (), or Schupo () for short, is a uniform-wearing branch of the &quot;Landespolizei&quot;, the state (&quot;Land&quot;) level police of the states of Germany. &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; literally means security or protection police, but it is best translated as protection police.
The &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; has by far the largest number of personnel, is on duty 24 hours per day, and has the broadest range of duties. On patrol duty, mainly in vehicles, they keep their respective area under surveillance.

As in most other countries, the uniformed police in Germany are usually the first to arrive at the scene of an incident, whether it is a crime or an accident. They also take the initial action (&quot;Erster Angriff&quot;), even if the case is later handed over to investigators of the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Criminal Investigation Police).

&quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; officers are also responsible for promoting public safety, crime prevention, criminal prosecution and traffic control.</text><links>

<text>Alexandros &#x27;Alekos&#x27; Alavanos (; born 22 May 1950 in Athens) is a Greek politician, former member of the Hellenic Parliament and the European Parliament. From 2004 until 2008 he was president of the Coalition of the Left of Movements and Ecology, commonly known as &quot;Synaspismos&quot;. He was parliamentary leader of the wider Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born on 22 May 1950 in Athens, Alavanos has been politically active since his youth. During the military dictatorship of 1967-1974, Alavanos participated in the student movement against the regime; as a result his military service deferment was revoked and he was briefly incarcerated in the EAT/ESA military prison.

===Political career===
He was elected to the European Parliament in 1981 with the Communist Party of Greece and again in 1989, 1994 and 1999 with Synaspismos.

In the 2004 Greek legislative election, Alavanos was elected MP in Athens. Since Nikos Konstantopoulos, his predecessor in Synaspismos&#x27; leadership, announced his intention not to be a candidate for another term, Alavanos announced his own candidacy for the office. The party congress elected him president on 12 December 2004.

In the 2007 Greek legislative election, running as leader of SYRIZA, which more than doubled its parliamentary seats, he was narrowly elected an MP in Heraklion, Crete.

On 27 November 2007, Alavanos announced that he would not apply for a renewal of his presidency of Synaspismos at its 5th party congress in February 2008, due to private reasons. He was replaced by Alexis Tsipras.

In February 2011 he left Synaspismos and founded the Front of Solidarity and Overthrow with other former members of Coalition of the Radical Left. Communist Organization of Greece, Internationalist Workers&#x27; Left, Movement for the United in Action Left and Anticapitalist Political Group joined the front, but they left it in 2012 due to political disputes.

He again founded a new political party in 2013, founding Plan B specifically to contest the 2014 European Parliament election in Greece. The party&#x27;s platform is centered on exiting Greece from the eurozone.

===Personal life===
Alekos Alavanos is an economist. He is married to Aikaterini Charalambaki and is the father of two daughters.

<text>Champurrado is a chocolate-based &quot;atole&quot;, a warm and thick Mexican beverage. It is prepared with either a &quot;masa&quot; (lime-treated corn dough),&quot; masa harina&quot; (a dried version of this dough), or corn flour (simply very finely ground dried corn, especially local varieties grown for &quot;atole&quot;); &quot;piloncillo&quot;; water or milk; and occasionally containing cinnamon, anise seed, or vanilla. Ground nuts, orange zest, and egg can also be added to thicken and enrich the drink. &quot;Atole&quot; drinks are whipped up using a wooden whisk called a &quot;molinillo&quot;. The whisk is rolled between the palms of the hands, then moved back and forth in the mixture, until it is aerated and frothy; a blender may also be used.

Champurrado is traditionally served with a &quot;churro&quot; in the morning as a simple breakfast or as a late afternoon snack. Champurrado is also very popular during Day of the Dead and at &quot;Las Posadas&quot; (during the Christmas season), where it is served alongside &quot;tamales&quot;. Champurrado may also be made with alcohol.

== History ==
Chocolate is native to Mesoamerica, and it was first cultivated by the Mayans and the Mexicas. The Mayans used the cacao beans in various ceremonies such as marriage and trade. Natives drank chocolate with corn puree, or masa. These drinks were thought of as magical and upon drinking, would give the drinker power and strength.

Since sugarcane (originally from Southeast Asia) came to the Americas sometime after Europeans did, chocolate was said to have an acquired taste as it comes off as bitter without added sweetener. The Spaniards created a drink consisting of chocolate, vanilla, and other spices which was served chilled. This drink cannot be compared to modern-day hot chocolate as it was very spicy and bitter, contrasting with the modern notion of very sweet, warm chocolate.

The invention of champurrado shows the adaptation of ancient practices by European colonialists. Upon the production of the drink, special tools like the molinillo were made to assist in the making of the drink which is now also used to make traditional hot chocolate in former Spanish colonies.

There are many versions of champurrado in different countries. A unique variant in the Philippines is champorado. Although adapted directly from Mexican champurrado via the Manila galleons, it differs in that it uses whole grains of glutinous rice instead of &quot;masa&quot;. Instead of a drink, it is a sweet rice porridge traditionally eaten during cold rainy days and in the Christmas season.

Many Latin Americans, especially Mexicans, enjoy champurrado around the holidays when the weather is colder. It differs significantly from hot chocolate in its taste and texture. The taste of the beverage also varies based on how it was made.

== Terminology ==
Champurrado is a type of atole (corn &quot;masa&quot; drink) with its main characteristic consisting of chocolate. The difference between traditional hot chocolate and champurrado is the use of &quot;masa harina &quot;(). Atole is made by toasting masa on a griddle, then adding water that has been boiled with cinnamon sticks. The resulting blends vary in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin, liquid consistency. In northern Mexico, a variation is also made using &quot;pinole&quot; (sweetened toasted corn meal). Although atole is one of the traditional drinks of the Mexican holidays Day of the Dead and Las Posadas, it is very common during breakfast and dinner time at any time of year. In the state Chiapas, it is common for the indigenous Tzotzil people to sell atole. It is usually sold as street food but can be found in various Latin restaurants. The inclusion of chocolate to the atole gives birth to champurrado.

There are many different types of recipes to make champurrado. Different states in Mexico for example, use spices to enhance its taste. Cooking champurrado in a clay pot is also traditional and brings out the flavor even further.

<text>German Christians () were a pressure group and a movement within the German Evangelical Church that existed between 1932 and 1945, aligned towards the antisemitic, racist, and &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; ideological principles of Nazism with the goal to align German Protestantism as a whole towards those principles. Their advocacy of these principles led to a schism within 23 of the initially 28 regional church bodies (&quot;Landeskirchen&quot;) in Germany and the attendant foundation of the opposing Confessing Church in 1934. was a co-founder of the German Christians. 

==History==
===Antecedents===
====Lutheranism====
====Imperial Germany====
During the period of the German Empire, before the Weimar Republic, the Protestant churches (&quot;Landeskirchen&quot;) in Germany were divided along state and provincial borders. Each state or provincial church was supported by and affiliated with the regnal house—if it was Protestant—in its particular region; the crown provided financial and institutional support to its church. Church and state were therefore, to a large extent, combined on a regional basis. Monarchies of Roman Catholic dynasties also organised church bodies that were territorially defined by their state borders. The same was true for the three republican German states within the pre-1918 Empire. In Alsace-Lorraine the Napoleonic system of &quot;établissements publics du culte&quot; for the Calvinist, Jewish, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic congregations and umbrellas remained in effect.

====Austria-Hungary====
Karl Lueger&#x27;s antisemitic Christian Social Party is sometimes viewed as a model for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazism. Hitler praised Lueger in his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; as an inspiration. In 1943, Nazi Germany produced the biographical film &quot;Vienna 1910&quot; about Lueger; the film was awarded the standing of &quot;special political value&quot;.
====Weimar Republic====
With the end of World War I and the resulting political and social turmoil, the regional churches lost their secular rulers. With revolutionary fervor in the air, the conservative church leaders had to contend with socialists who favoured disestablishment.

After considerable political maneuvering, state churches were abolished (in name) under the new Weimar government, but the anti-disestablishmentarians prevailed in substance: churches remained public corporations and retained their subsidies from the government. Religious instruction in the schools continued, as did the theological faculties in the universities. The rights formerly held by the princes in the German Empire simply devolved to church councils.

Accordingly, in this initial period of the Weimar Republic, the Protestant Church in Germany now operated as a federation of 28 regional (or provincial) churches. The federation operated officially through the representative German Evangelical Church Confederation (&quot;Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund&quot; (DEKB)); the League was itself established in 1922 by the rather loose annual convention called Church General Assembly (&quot;Kirchentag&quot;), which was composed of the members of the various regional churches. The League was governed and administered by a 36-member Executive Committee (&quot;Kirchenausschuss&quot;) which was responsible for ongoing governance between the annual conventions of the &quot;Kirchentag&quot;.

Save for the organisational matters under the jurisdiction of the national League, the regional churches remained independent in other matters, including theology, and the federal system allowed for a great deal of regional autonomy.

===Nazi Germany===

====Ideology====
The German Christians were, for the most part, a &quot;group of fanatically Nazi Protestants.&quot; They began as an interest group and eventually came to represent one of the schismatic factions of German Protestantism.

Their movement was sustained and encouraged by factors such as:
* the 400th anniversary (in 1917) of Martin Luther&#x27;s publication of the Ninety-five Theses in 1517, an event which endorsed German nationalism, stoked hostility toward foreign peoples, granted Germany a preferred place in the Protestant tradition, and legitimised antisemitism;
* the antisemitic writings of Martin Luther (e.g., &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;);
* the Luther Renaissance Movement of Professor Emmanuel Hirsch; supported by publications by Guida Diehl, the first speaker of the National Socialist Women&#x27;s League;
* the revival of &quot;völkisch&quot; traditions;
* the de-emphasis of the Old Testament in Lutheran theology, and the partial or total removal of Jewishness from the Bible;
* the respect for temporal (secular) authority, which had been emphasised by Luther. The movement used scriptural support (Romans 13) to justify this position.

The German Christians were sympathetic to the Nazi regime&#x27;s goal of &quot;co-ordinating&quot; (&quot;see&quot; &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;) the individual Protestant churches into a single and uniform Reich church, consistent with the &quot;Volk&quot; ethos and the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;.

The editor Professor Wilhelm Knevels of the journal &quot;Christentum und Leben&quot; (i.e., Christianity and Life) also worked for the &quot;Institute for Research and the Elimination of Jewish influence on German Church Life&quot;—and his journal published articles like &quot;Heroic Christianity&quot; (&quot;Heroisches Christentum&quot;, 1935) and &quot;Why not only God? Why Jesus?&quot; (&quot;Warum nicht nur Gott? Warum Jesus?&quot;, April 1942).

The &quot;Martin Luther Memorial Church&quot; (&quot;Martin-Luther-Gedächtniskirche&quot;), which was built in Berlin from 1933 to 1935 included a pulpit that showed the Sermon on the Mount with a &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;-wearing &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; soldier listening to Jesus and a baptismal font which featured an SA stormtrooper. The swastikas were removed after the war and the former church has been reconstructed as a memorial to Nazi crimes against humanity.

Under the authority of Alfred Rosenberg and his religious theories, the Protestant minister established an &quot;Institute of Religious Studies&quot; as part of the Advanced School of the NSDAP.

====Formation====

The German Christians were organised as a &quot;Kirchenpartei&quot; (church party; i.e., a nominating group) in 1931 to help win elections of presbyteries and synods (i.e., legislating church assemblies) in the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, the largest of the independent &quot;Landeskirchen&quot;. They were led by Ludwig Müller, a rather incompetent &quot;old fighter&quot; who had no particular leadership skills or qualifications, except having been a longtime faithful Nazi. He was advised by Emanuel Hirsch. In 1931, the book &quot;Salvation from chaotic madness&quot; by Guida Diehl, the first speaker of the National Socialist Women&#x27;s League, got an admiring review by the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Monatshefte&quot;—she was praised for fighting against the &quot;ridicule of Christ&quot; and &quot;showing the way for German Christians&quot;. The Berlin section was founded by Wilhelm Kube in 1932. The group achieved no particular notoriety before the Nazi assumption of political power in January 1933. In the Prussian church elections of November 1932, German Christians won one-third of the vote.

Hitler was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; was in its full sway in the first few months of the regime. In late April 1933, the leadership of the 1922-founded German Evangelical Church Confederation, in the spirit of the new regime, agreed to write a new constitution for a brand new, unitary, &quot;national&quot; church, which would be called the German Evangelical Church (&quot;Deutsche Evangelische Kirche&quot;, or DEK). The new and unified national DEK would completely replace and supersede the old federated church with its representative league.

This church reorganisation had been a goal of the German Christians for some time, as such a centralisation would enhance the coordination of Church and State, as a part of the overall Nazi process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;. The German Christians agitated for Müller to be elected as the new Church&#x27;s bishop (&quot;Reichsbischof&quot;).

====Bishopric====
Müller had poor political skills, little political support within the Church, and no real qualifications for the job, other than his commitment to Nazism and a desire to exercise power. When the federation council met in May 1933 to approve the new constitution, it elected Friedrich von Bodelschwingh as &quot;Reichsbischof&quot; of the new Protestant Reich Church by a wide margin, largely on the advice and support of the church leadership.

Hitler was infuriated with the rejection of his candidate, and things began to change. By June 1933, the German Christians had gained leadership of some &quot;Landeskirchen&quot; within the DEK and were, of course, supported by Nazi propaganda in their efforts to reverse the humiliating loss to Bodelschwingh. After a series of Nazi-directed political maneuvers, Bodelschwingh resigned and Müller was appointed as the new &quot;Reichsbischof&quot; in July 1933.

====Aryan paragraph====
Further pro-Nazi developments followed the elevation of Müller to the DEK bishopric: In late summer, the old-Prussian general synod (led by Müller) adopted the Aryan paragraph, effectively defrocking clergy of Jewish descent and even clergy married to non-Aryans.

With their &quot;Gleichschaltungspolitik&quot; and their attempts to incorporate the Aryan paragraph into the church constitution so as to exclude Jewish Christians, the German Christians entered into a &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; with other evangelical Christians. Their opponents founded the Confessing Church in 1934, which condemned the German Christians as heretics and claimed to be the true German Protestant Church.

====Impact====
The Nazis found the German Christians useful during the initial consolidation of power, but removed most of its leaders from their posts shortly afterwards; &quot;Reichsbischof&quot; Müller continued until 1945, but his power was effectively removed in favor of a government agency as a result of his obvious incompetence.

The German Christians were supportive of the Nazi Party&#x27;s ideas about race. They issued public statements in which they claimed that Christians in Germany with Jewish ancestors &quot;remain Christians in a New Testament sense, but they are not German Christians.&quot; They also supported the Nazi Party platform&#x27;s advocacy of &quot;Positive Christianity&quot;, a form of Christianity that did not stress the belief in human sinfulness. Some of them went so far as to call for the total removal of all Jewish elements from the Bible, including the Old Testament. Their symbol was a traditional Christian cross with a swastika in the middle and the group&#x27;s German initials &quot;D&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.

It was claimed and remembered by the German Christians, as a &quot;fact&quot;, that &quot;the Jews&quot; had killed Christ, which appealed to and actively encouraged existing antisemitic sentiments among Christians in Nazi Germany.

===Precursors===
====19th century====
The forerunner of the ideology of the German Christians came from certain Protestant groups of the German Empire. These groups sought a return to perceived völkisch, nationalistic, and racist ideas within traditional Christianity, and looked to turn Christianity in Germany into a reformed intrinsic folk-religion (). They found their model in the Berlin &quot;Hofprediger&quot; Adolf Stoecker, who was politically active and tried to position the Christian working-classes and lower-middle-classes against what he perceived as Jewish &quot;Überfremdung&quot;.

The &quot;Bayreuther Blätter&quot; devoted its June 1892 issue to a memorial of Paul de Lagarde and it emphatically recommended his work to its readers. Ludwig Schemann, one of the most prolific of Bayreuth Germanics and racists, and later the author of a full-length biography of Lagarde, summarised his life and work and concluded that &quot;for the comprehension of Lagarde&#x27;s whole being one must above all remember that he always considered himself the prophet and guide of his people — which of course he actually was.&quot; For Schemann his legacy consisted largely of his struggle against the Jews: &quot;Not since the days of Schopenhauer and Wagner is the German thinker so mightily opposed this alien people, which desecrates our holy possessions, poisons our people, and seeks to wrest our property from us so as to completely trample on us, as Lagarde has&quot; It was this image of Lagarde, the antisemitic prophet of a purified and heroic Germany, which the political Wagnerites and the &quot;Bayreuther Blätter&quot; kept alive. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Wagner&#x27;s son-in-law and intellectual disciple, wrote: &quot;For us, the &quot;Deutsche Schriften&quot; have for a long time belonged to our most precious books, and we consider Lagarde&#x27;s unabashed exposure of the inferiority of Semitic religious instincts and the pernicious effects on Christianity as an achievement that deserves our admiration and gratitude.&quot;

In 1896 Arthur Bonus advocated a &quot;Germanisation of Christianity&quot;. Max Bewer alleged in his 1907 book &quot;Der deutsche Christus&quot; (&quot;The German Christ&quot;), Jesus stemmed from German soldiers in the Roman garrison in Galilee and his preaching showed the influence of &quot;German blood&quot;. He concluded that the Germans were the best Christians among all peoples, only prevented from the full flowering of their spiritual faculties by the materialistic Jews. Julius Bode, however, concluded that the Christianisation of the Germans was the imposition of an &quot;un-German&quot; religious understanding, and that Germanic feeling remained alien to it and so should remain exempt from it.

====20th century====
On the 400th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation, in 1917, Flensburg pastor Friedrich Andersen, writer Adolf Bartels, and Hans Paul Freiherr von Wolzogen presented &quot;95 Thesen&quot; on which a &quot;German Christianity on a Protestant basis&quot; should be founded. It stated:

For the authors of the &quot;Thesen&quot;, the &quot;angry thunder-god&quot; Jehovah was the same as the &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;[Holy] Ghost&quot;, that Christ preached and that the Germans would have guessed. Childlike confidence in God and selfless love was, to them, the essence of the Germanic &quot;people&#x27;s-soul&quot; in contrast to Jewish &quot;menial fear of God&quot; and &quot;materialistic morality.&quot; Church was not an &quot;institution for the dissemination of Judaism&quot;, and they felt religious and confirmation materials should no longer teach the Old Testament and the Ten Commandments, nor even the New Testament, which they held to be of Jewish influence that had to be &quot;cleaned&quot; so that the child Jesus could be used as a model for &quot;self sacrifice&quot; and &quot;male heroism&quot;.

In 1920 minister Karl Gerecke published &quot;Biblical anti-Semitism&quot; in the Volksverlag of Ernst Boepple, one of the founders of the German Workers&#x27; Party.

Dietrich Eckart, an early mentor of Hitler, also emphasised the &quot;manliness&quot; of Jesus Christ and compared him to the Norse god Baldr.

In 1921 Andersen wrote &quot;Der deutsche Heiland&quot; (The German Saviour), in which he opposed Jewish migration as an apocalyptic decision:

Against the &quot;contamination by Jewish ideas&quot;, mainly from the Old Testament, the Churches and Germany should (he argued) be &quot;mutually benefits and supports&quot;, and then Christianity would win back its status as &quot;a religion of the &quot;Volk&quot; and of the struggle&quot; and &quot;the great exploiter of humanity, the evil enemy of our &quot;Volk&quot; [would] finally be destroyed&quot;.

In the same year, 1921, the Protestant-dominated and &quot;völkisch&quot;-oriented League for German Churches () was founded in Berlin. Andersen, pastor Ernst Bublitz, and teacher Kurd Joachim Niedlich brought out the twice-monthly &quot;The German Church&quot; () magazine, which in 12,000 articles advanced the &quot;Bund&quot;&#x27;s ideas. Jesus should be a &quot;tragic-Nordic figure&quot; against the Old Testament&#x27;s &quot;religious idea&quot;, with the Old Testament replaced by a &quot;German myth&quot;. Each biblical story was to be &quot;measured under German feelings, so that German Christianity escapes from Semitic influence as Beelzebub did before the Cross.&quot;

In 1925 groups such as the &quot;Bund&quot; united with ten &quot;völkisch&quot;, Germanophile, and antisemitic organisations to form the German Christian Working Group (). The Christian-Spirit Religious Society (), founded in 1927 in Nuremberg by Artur Dinter, saw more effect in the churches, striving for the &#x27;de-Judification&#x27; () and the building of a non-denominational People&#x27;s Church ().

The proposed abolition of the Old Testament was in part fiercely opposed among Christian German nationalists, seeing it as a racist attack on the foundations of their faith from inside and outside. Theologian Johannes Schneider, a member of the German National People&#x27;s Party ( or DNVP) (a party fairly close to the political aims of the NSDAP), wrote in 1925:
In 1927 the Protestant Church League () reacted to the growing radicalisation of German Christian groups with a Churches Day in Königsberg, aiming to clarify Christianity&#x27;s relation to &quot;Fatherland&quot;, &quot;Nation&quot;, &quot;Volkstum&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, and &quot;Race&quot;. Many local church-officers tried to delineate, such as with regards to racism, but this only served to show how deeply it had intruded into their thinking. Paul Althaus, for example, wrote:

On this basis, the radical German-Christians&#x27; ideas were hardly slowed down. In 1928 they gathered in Thuringia to found the Thuringian German Christians&#x27; Church Movement (), seeking contact with the Nazi Party and naming their newsletter &quot;Letters to German Christians&quot; ().

=====Pagan and anti-Christian trends=====
Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s book &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot; () resonated in these circles and gave them renewed impetus. His polemic against all &quot;un-German&quot; and &quot;root-stock&quot; elements in Christianity was directed against the Christianity and the denominational organisations of the time. Marxism and Catholic Internationalism were attacked as two facets of the Jewish spirit, and Rosenberg stated the need for a new national religion to complete the Reformation.

The Associated German Religious Movement (), founded in Eisenach at the end of 1933, was also an attempt to create a national religion outside and against the churches. It combined six earlier Nordic-völkisch oriented groups and a further five groups were represented by individual members. Jakob Wilhelm Hauer became the group&#x27;s &quot;leader and representative&quot; by acclamation, and other members included philosopher Ernst Bergmann (1881–1945), racial ideologue Hans F. K. Günther, writer Ernst Graf zu Reventlow, historian Herman Wirth, Ludwig Fahrenkrog, and Lothar Stengel-von Rutkowski.

===Attempts to &quot;de-Judaise&quot; the Bible===

In 1939 with the approval of eleven of the German Protestant regional churches the Eisenacher Institute for the Study and Elimination of Jewish Influence on German Church Life (called the &quot;Dejudaisation Institute&quot;) was founded, led by Siegfried Leffler and Walter Grundmann. One of its main tasks was to compile a &quot;People&#x27;s Testament&quot; () in the sense of what Rosenberg called a &quot;Fifth Gospel&quot;, to announce the myth of the &quot;Aryan Jesus&quot;. It became clear in 1994 that the Testament&#x27;s poetic text was written by the famous ballad-poet and proprietor of the Eugen-Diederichs-Verlag, . Despite broad church support for it (even many Confessing Christians advocated such an approach, in the hope that the disaffiliation of 1937 to 1940 could be curbed), the first edition of the text did not meet with the expected enthusiastic response.

===After 1945===
After 1945, the remaining German Christian currents formed smaller communities and circles distanced from the newly formed umbrella of the independent church bodies Protestant Church in Germany. German Christian-related parties sought to influence the historiography of the &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; in the so-called &quot;church-historical working group&quot;, but they had little effect from then on in theology and politics. Other former members of the German Christians moved into the numerically insignificant religious communities known as the Free People&#x27;s Christian Church () and the People&#x27;s Movement of Free Church Christians () after 1945.

In 1980, in the context of a statement entitled &quot;Towards Renovation of the Relationship of Christians and Jews (&quot;Zur Erneuerung des Verhältnisses von Christen und Juden&quot;), the Synod of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland stated that it recognised and &quot;confess, with dismay, the co-responsibility and guilt of German Christians for the Holocaust.&quot; On May 6, 2019, eighty years after the founding of the “Dejudaisation Institute”, the Dejudaisation Institute Memorial was unveiled in Eisenach at the behest of eight Protestant regional churches. It is intended to be understood as the Protestant churches’ confession of guilt and as a memorial to the victims of the church’s anti-Judaism and antisemitism.

<text>BR-277 is a federal highway of Brazil, across the state of Paraná, between the town of Paranaguá and Foz do Iguaçu. 

== Economic importance == 

The highway has high economic importance for Brazil and even for Paraguay, as it connects the Brazil-Paraguay border with Port of Paranaguá. On the border there is intense trade between the two countries; there is great tourism in the Foz do Iguaçu area due to the border trade and mainly because of the Iguaçu Falls. In Paraná, there is a large production of soy, corn, chicken, milk, cellulose and fish, among other products (which are exported in Paranaguá), and Paraguay uses the port to carry out part of its exports. 

==Duplications==

The highway is duplicated in the 140 km between the Port of Paranaguá, Curitiba and the junction with the BR-376.

BR-277, as well as BRs 369 and 376, which form a triangle within the state of Paraná, were granted to private companies in 1997, at the beginning of the era of road concessions in Brazil. The contracts are valid until 2021. Initially, 995 km of roads in Paraná should be duplicated, and the population was promised that the State would have First World highways, strongly boosting economic growth. But additions were soon signed that removed duplications and other works from the contracts. The duplication commitment fell from 995 to 616 km. To make matters worse, in 2019, what had been doubled was no more than 300 km, even with toll rates rising every year. The MPF (Federal Public Ministry) then carried out Operation Integration, which showed that the changes made to the contracts are part of a millionaire kickback scheme. The companies paid at least R $ 35 million in fees to achieve these changes in contracts. The estimated diversion of money in the toll system amounts to R $ 8.4 billion. Some of those cited by the MPF to receive these fees are: Jaime Lerner, Roberto Requião and Beto Richa, all former governors of the State of Paraná, and the concessionaires Rodonorte, Econorte, Ecovía, Ecocataratas, Caminhos do Paraná and Viapar. 

For the next concession, to take place in 2021, the Federal Government, under the command of Jair Bolsonaro, and the Government of the State of Paraná, under the command of Ratinho Júnior, intend, together, adopt a model with lower tariffs, ensure that duplications occur quickly, and also ensure transparency in spending.

<text>The German Evangelical Church () was a successor to the German Protestant Church Confederation from 1933 until 1945. It is also known in English as the Protestant Reich Church () and colloquially as the Reich Church ().

The German Christians, an antisemitic and racist pressure group and &quot;Kirchenpartei&quot;, gained enough power on boards of the member churches to be able to install Ludwig Müller to the office of &quot;&quot; in the 1933 church elections. The German Protestant Church Confederation was subsequently renamed the German Evangelical Church. In 1934, the German Evangelical Church suffered controversies and internal struggles which left member churches either detached or reorganised into German Christians-led dioceses of what was to become a single, unified Reich Church compatible with Nazi ideology for all of Nazi Germany.

In 1935, in wake of controversies and church struggles, the Ministry for Church Affairs removed Ludwig Müller and installed a committee headed by to lead the confederation. As a result, the German Evangelical Church regained partial support as some of the member churches that left rejoined. In 1936, the Zoellner committee denounced German Christians and increasingly leaned towards the Confessing Church and its positions. In 1937, the Nazis removed the Zoellner committee and reinstalled German Christians into the leading position. In 1937–1945, the German Evangelical Church was controlled by German Christians and the Ministry. It was no longer considered a subject to the &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; (struggle of the churches) to Adolf Hitler. It officially disbanded in 1945 after the war ended. It was succeeded by the Protestant Church in Germany in 1948.

==Overview==
In 1933, the German Christians took leadership in some member churches of the German Protestant Church Confederation. A new designation was voted on and adopted, with the organisation now being called the German Evangelical Church. In its early stages, it remained a loose confederation of churches just like its predecessor. It included the vast majority of Protestants in what was now Nazi Germany, excluding those affiliated with the free churches like the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church. In a 1933 vote to the &quot;Reichssynode&quot;, the German Christians were able to elect Ludwig Müller, a pro-Nazi pastor, to the office of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Reich Bishop&quot;). On 20 December 1933, Müller merged the church&#x27;s Protestant youth organisations into the Hitler Jugend without consulting their leadership or any member churches. Many in the German Evangelical Church resisted this idea and a discussion began.

Müller tried to silence it by introducing discipline and using the powers of the elected office. His attempts failed, prompting Adolf Hitler to meet with Protestant leaders on 25 January 1934. Although the meeting ended with Protestant churches declaring their loyalty to the state, removing Müller was not a subject to discussion for Hitler. After that, member churches began to either reorganise or detach from the German Evangelical Church. Initially, there was little resistance to the attempt to introduce elements of Nazi ideology into church doctrine. Most of the resistance came from confessing communities (&quot;bekennende Gemeinden&quot;) within &quot; and &quot; (see below) and the &quot;Pfarrernotbund&quot; (Emergency Covenant of Pastors) led by pastor Martin Niemöller.

In consequence of the 1934 meeting, many member churches distanced themselves from the increasingly Nazi-controlled Reich Church due to controversies pertaining to its constitution, the nazification of its theology, leadership, incorporation of its youth organisations into the Hitler Jugend, etc. Such churches became neutral or followed the Protestant opposition to Nazism that established an alternative umbrella organisation of their own that became known as the Confessing Church. The Reich Church ultimately ended up being a confederation of those German Protestant churches that espoused a single doctrine named Positive Christianity, which was compatible with Nazism. Although it aimed to eventually become a unified Protestant state church for all of Nazi Germany, this attempt utterly failed as the German Evangelical Church became fractured into various groups that bore an unclear legal status in relation to each other:

*churches with a German Christians-dominated governing board reorganising them into dioceses of the Reich Church led by German Christians (&quot;dioceses of the German Evangelical Church&quot; [&quot;Bistümer der Deutschen Evangelischen Kirche&quot;] in official usage, or &quot;&quot; [&quot;zerstörte Kirchen&quot;] in the parlance of the Confessing Church)
*churches with a governing board without a German Christian majority merging them as members of the Reich Church, but rejected Müller as its leader (the Churches of Bavaria, of Hanover, of Westphalia, and of Württemberg) (&quot;&quot; [&quot;intakte Kirchen&quot;] in Confessing Church parlance) 
*the Confessing Church that saw itself as the true Protestant church for all of Germany, provided resistance to the German Christians-led German Evangelical Church and to its so-called dioceses (&quot;destroyed churches&quot;), and acted on principles of the &quot;1934 church emergency law of Dahlem&quot; that deemed the constitution of the German Evangelical Church &quot;shattered&quot; (the &quot;Confessing Church&quot;, &quot;Bekennende Kirche&quot;)

Müller&#x27;s influence declined after more constant clashes in the German Evangelical Church, triggering the foundation of the Ministry for Church Affairs led by Hans Kerrl on 16 July 1935. A decree, issued by Kerrl in September 1935, appointed a committee led by Wilhelm Zoellner (Church of Westphalia) to head the Reich Church instead of Müller. It was received positively by intact churches and even confessing parts of the German Evangelical Church. In 1936, the committee denounced the teachings of the German Christians-controlled Church of Thuringia, and the regime feared that the Confessing Church would gain more support due to this. In February 1937, the committee was removed by the Nazis and leading figures of the Protestant resistance like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Niemöller and others were arrested. In 1939, Müller tried to regain his position in the German Evangelical Church but failed to do so. After 1937, the German Evangelical Church was not considered an issue in the &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; by the Nazis as it became heavily controlled by the Ministry until 1945.

In August 1945, the German Evangelical Church was officially dissolved by the council of the newly founded Protestant umbrella organisation called the Protestant Church in Germany.

==Beginnings, German Christians and Nazi influence (1933–1934)==

Under the Weimar Republic, the system of state churches disappeared with the German monarchies. At this point, the unification of the Protestant churches into a single organisation seemed like a possibility, albeit a remote one. Since unification, clergy and ecclesiastical administrators had discussed a merger, but one had never materialised due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation of Lutheran, Calvinist and United churches. In 1920, Swiss Protestant churches came together in the Schweizerischer Evangelischer Kirchenbund (SEK). Following their example, the then 28 territorially defined German Protestant churches founded the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund (DEK) in 1922. This was not a merger into a single church but a loose federation of independent ones.

The founding of the German Evangelical Church was the result of work by the &quot;Kirchenpartei&quot; of the German Christians who had gained a large majority at the 1933 church elections. In September 1934, the merger finally failed when the synods of two of the 28 churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the river Rhine, the portion of Bavaria which forms today&#x27;s Free State (without the Palatinate left of the Rhine), and the Evangelical State Church in Württemberg, refused to dissolve their church bodies as independent entities, and the Berlin-based &quot;Landgericht I&quot; court restored the largest church body, the by then already merged Evangelical Church of the Old-Prussian Union by its resolution in November the same year, thus resuming independence. Consequently, the German Evangelical Church, created as a merger, then continued to exist as a mere umbrella.

==Controversies, internal struggles and conflict with the Confessing Church (1934–1937)==
Some Protestant functionaries and laymen opposed the unification. Many more agreed but wanted it under Protestant principles, not imposed by Nazi partisans. The Protestant opposition had organised first among pastors by way of the Emergency Covenant of Pastors and then—including laymen—developed into grassroots meetings establishing independent synods by January 1934. At the first Reich&#x27;s Synod of Confession (&quot;erste Reichsbekenntnissynode&quot;) held in Wuppertal-Barmen between 29 and 31 May 1934, it called itself the Confessing Church.

On 16 July 1935, Hanns Kerrl was appointed Reichsminister for Church Affairs, a newly created department. He started negotiations to find a compromise and dropped the extreme German Christians, trying to win moderate Confessing Christians and respected neutrals. On 24 September 1935, a new law empowered Kerrl to legislate by way of ordinances within the German Evangelical Church, circumventing any synodal autonomy.

Kerrl managed to gain the very respected Wilhelm Zoellner (a Lutheran, until 1931 General Superintendent of the old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of Westphalia) to form the Reich&#x27;s Ecclesiastical Committee (&quot;Reichskirchenausschuss&quot;, RKA) on 3 October 1935, combining the neutral and moderate groups to reconcile the disputing church parties. The official German Evangelical Church became subordinate to the new bureaucracy, and Müller lost power but still retained the now meaningless titles of German Reich&#x27;s Bishop and old-Prussian State Bishop.

In November, Kerrl decreed the parallel institutions of the Confessing Church were to be dissolved, a move which was protested and ignored by Confessing Church leaders. On 19 December, Kerrl issued a decree which forbade all kinds of Confessing Church activities, namely appointments of pastors, education, examinations, ordinations, ecclesiastical visitations, announcements and declarations from the pulpit, separate financial structures and convening Synods of Confession; further the decree established provincial ecclesiastical committees. Thus, the &quot;brethren councils&quot; had to go into hiding, and Kerrl successfully wedged the Confessing Church.

The Gestapo increased its suppression, undermining the readiness for compromises among the Confessing Church. Zoellner concluded that this made his reconciliatory work impossible and criticised the Gestapo activities. He resigned on 2 February 1937, paralysing the Ecclesiastical Committee which lost all recognition among the opposition. Kerrl now subjected Müller&#x27;s chancery of the German Evangelical Church directly to his ministry and the national, provincial and state ecclesiastical committees were soon after dissolved.

==German Christian takeover until dissolution (1937–1945)==
Although the church was initially supported by the regime, the Nazis eventually lost interest in the experiment after it failed to supplant or absorb traditional Protestant churches. After 1937, relations between the Reich Church and the Nazi government began to sour.

On 19 November 1938, as reported on in the &quot;Ludington Daily News&quot;, YHWH was ordered to be erased from Protestant churches within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union by , the president of its executive board (Evangelical Supreme Church Council; EOK). His order said the name of the &#x27;God of Israel&#x27; (which contemporarily has Judaic connotations) must be obliterated wherever it was displayed in Protestant churches.

On 1 September 1939, Kerrl decreed the separation of the ecclesiastical and the administrative governance within the official Evangelical Church. The German Christian Friedrich Werner, president of EOK, won over August Marahrens, State Bishop of the &quot;intact&quot; Church of Hanover, and the theologians Walther Schultz, a German Christian, and Friedrich Hymmen, vice president of the Old-Prussian Evangelical Supreme Church Council, to form an Ecclesiastical Council of Confidence (&quot;Geistlicher Vertrauensrat&quot;). This council exercised ecclesiastical leadership for the church from early 1940 and afterwards.

On 22 December 1941, the German Evangelical Church issued a request for the relevant authorities &quot;to take suitable measures so that baptized non-Aryans remain separate from the ecclesiastical life of the German congregations&quot;, a call for strict segregation between &quot;non-Aryan&quot; Protestants, and German Protestant congregations and facilities. Many German Christian-dominated congregations followed suit. The Confessing Church&#x27;s executive together with the conference of the state brethren councils (representing the Confessing Church adherents within the destroyed churches) issued a declaration of protest.

After World War II, Theophil Wurm, Landesbischof of Württemberg, invited representatives of the surviving German regional Protestant church bodies to Treysa for 31 August 1945. As to co-operation between the Protestant churches in Germany, strong resentments prevailed, especially among the Lutheran church bodies of Bavaria right of the river Rhine, the Hamburgian State, Hanover, Mecklenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia, against any unification after the experiences during Nazi rule. It was decided to replace the former German Federation of Protestant Churches with the new umbrella Protestant Church in Germany, provisionally led by the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany, a naming borrowed from the Reich&#x27;s brethren council organisation.

<text>John Wyer (11 December 1909 – 8 April 1989), was an English automobile racing engineer and team manager. He is mainly associated with cars running in the light blue and orange livery of his longtime sponsor Gulf Oil.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Wyer was born in Kidderminster, England in 1909.
=== Aston Martin ===
As team manager and team owner, Wyer won the 24 Hours of Le Mans several times. His first victory came in the 1959 edition, in his tenth anniversary as Aston Martin team manager, along with Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby, win with the DBR1. The team made their base for Le Mans at the Hotel De France from 1953 - 1975. The race cars would be tended within the courtyard and garage adjacent to the hotel before being driven to and from the circuit on the road for practice, qualifying and the race.

The team also won the 1000 km Nürburgring over three consecutive years.

=== Ford Advanced Vehicles ===

In 1963 he left Aston Martin for &quot;Ford Advanced Vehicles&quot; (FAV) In 1964. After dismal results with the GT40s in their first two years, mainly dealing with reliability due to mechanical failure, the Ford GT40 programme was handed over to Holman Moody and Carroll Shelby to compete against Ferrari, with the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans victory being the most famous, as well as 1967.

=== J. W. Automotive Engineering Ltd ===

Ford closed FAV after the 1966 season, and John Wyer and John Willment formed J.W. Automotive Engineering Ltd (JWA) to take over the Slough factory and continued to build production GT40s on Ford&#x27;s behalf. As Wyer was the well known team manager and present at race tracks, it was assumed that JW stands for John Wyer even though it is for John Willment, as stated by Willment&#x27;s brother-in-law Hans Herrmann.

With backing from Gulf Oil and their team manager J-O Bockman, Wyer created the Ford-powered Mirage M-1, a prototype that won the 1967 1000 km Spa. Due to a rule change that came in effect for 1968, the fast big engine prototypes were limited to 3,000 cc like in Formula 1. As only few of them were available, sportscars with up to 5,000 cc were allowed also if at least 50 of them were built. This applied to the two-year-old Ford GT40s, which were modified by Wyer. As a surprise, Wyer won the World Sportscar Championship for Ford in 1968 even though the 2,200 cc Porsche 907 were considered favourites at the beginning of the season. The superior power of the 302 cubic inch (4,942 cc) V8 in the GT40s allowed them to win on fast tracks, and especially at Le Mans two years in a row from 1968 (Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi) and 1969 (Jacky Ickx and Jackie Oliver), even though they were outclassed at twistier tracks.

It became apparent the GT40 would become obsolete after 1968 as the minimum numbers of sportscars was lowered to 25, a loop hole of which Porsche took advantage by building over two dozen 5,000 cc prototypes that were homologated as sports cars in 1969. The Porsche 917 were fast but in 1969 still unreliable and with bad handling. After the 1969 season, Wyer switched also to the 917 (and 908 for slow tracks), and the JWA team became the factory&#x27;s main partner. They were a major factor in developing the wedge-shaped &quot;Kurzheck&quot; tail of the 1970 917K which made the car much more stable than the original 1969 long version.

Battling with the works Ferrari 512s, and the other Porsche teams, the JWA Gulf-Porsche 917s, raced by Jo Siffert, Brian Redman, Leo Kinnunen, Pedro Rodríguez, Richard Attwood, Herbert Mueller and Derek Bell, earned seven out of Porsche&#x27;s nine victories in the 10 races of the 1970 season, and five out of Porsche&#x27;s eight victories in the 11 races of the 1971 season. During this period, the team&#x27;s best result at Le Mans was second place in 1971. In fiction, a Gulf-Porsche 917K won in the cult Steve McQueen movie &quot;Le Mans&quot;, making the Gulf colours even more famous.

The rule that permitted 5-litre sports cars like the 917s had been limited to 1971, and the new weight limit for 3,000 cc prototypes was too high for the Porsche 908, removing the 908&#x27;s advantage that balanced the lack of power of the air cooled 2-valve engine with low weight and good handling. As a result, Porsche left European style sportscar racing to privateers, and focussed on developing turboengines for the 917/10 Can-Am entry, as well as an already 9 year old car: the 911.

Wyer adopted the new 3.0-litre regulations and started building Gulf-Mirage prototypes again, using a Formula One Cosworth DFV engine. The successful F1-engine was considered unsuited for endurance racing as vibrations took their toll after several hours, so necessitating modifications. After three years of attempts, Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell achieved what would be Wyer&#x27;s last win at Le Mans in 1975.

=== Retirement and death ===

The following year, John Wyer retired from automotive competition and sold his team to Harley Cluxton&#x27;s &quot;Grand Touring Cars&quot; operation. He died in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States in 1989.

<doc id="1270010" wikidata="Q16221356" url="?curid=1270010" title="John Jenkins (Welsh politician)">
<text>John Paul Jenkins (born 1981) is a local politician in Wales, in the United Kingdom. He is a county councillor for the Elli ward of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, and a town councillor for the same ward on Llanelli Town Council. He stood for election as a candidate of the Conservative Party for both authorities.

==Background==
Jenkins was educated at Graig Comprehensive School, Llanelli, before studying social policy at the University of Wales, Swansea.

== Political career ==
Jenkins was elected at the local elections on 10 June 2004. As of 2006, he was the youngest elected representative in Carmarthenshire.

Before becoming a councillor, Jenkins was chosen by the Conservative Party in 2002 to be its candidate for the Llanelli constituency at the 2003 election to the National Assembly for Wales. However, in March 2003, just two months before polling day, Jenkins was reported to have made homophobic remarks on an internet forum. The story was first reported in the &quot;Western Mail&quot; and subsequently on the BBC Wales news.

Jenkins withdrew his candidacy although he claimed that his remarks had been taken out of context and that, &quot;a lot of selective editing was carried out somewhere between my actual comments being made and the reporting of my remarks in the &quot;Western Mail&quot; and subsequently the BBC.&quot;

Later in 2003, Jenkins started his campaign for election to Carmarthenshire County Council. Running with the slogan &quot;Standing up for Llanelli&quot; Jenkins won election to Carmarthenshire County Council and Llanelli Town Council in 2004.

As of 2006, he serves on Carmarthenshire County Council&#x27;s Planning Committee and Social Justice Scrutiny Committee, the latter being the committee that scrutinises the council&#x27;s equal opportunity policies. He is also a Carmarthenshire Local Education Authority appointed governor of Bryngwyn Comprehensive School in Dafen, Llanelli. He also serves on Llanelli Town Council&#x27;s Selwyn Samuel Management Committee and is a Minor Authority appointed governor of Old Road County Primary School in Llanelli.

===Second resignation===

On 15 February 2006, Jenkins was selected by the Conservative Party to contest the Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire constituency, in the 2007 Welsh Assembly election. However, the following day, Jenkins resigned as a Conservative candidate for the second time, on orders of Conservative leader David Cameron, because of his 2003 homophobic comments.

Jenkins subsequently announced that following his resignation as a candidate he was also quitting the Conservative Party because of what he saw as the Conservative Party&#x27;s unfair treatment towards him.

At the 2008 county council election Jenkins was re-elected by the Elli ward, but standing as an Independent.

In August 2012 Jenkins got into trouble again for his comments on social media when he suggested on Twitter to an unemployed woman that she get work as an escort, then describing a well-known footballer as a &quot;pervert&quot;. A complaint was made to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales.

<doc id="1270019" wikidata="Q281944" url="?curid=1270019" title="Pontiac Grand Am">
<text>The Pontiac Grand Am is a car model that Pontiac Division of General Motors produced in various years between 1973 and 2005. The first and second generations were RWD mid-size cars built on the LeMans GM A platform. The Grand Am name was reused for a FWD compact car for the third- and fourth-generations. The fifth-generation versions was enlarged to a mid-size car.

The platform began development intended to be the next generation GTO, but the muscle car era was drawing to a close. Pontiac decided to make this model America&#x27;s answer to European luxury sports sedans. The Grand Am name was derived from two other Pontiacs; &quot;Grand&quot; signifying Grand Prix luxury, and &quot;Am&quot; for Trans Am performance.

The first generation Grand Am featured innovations that included a deformable urethane nose (an evolution of the &quot;Endura&quot; bumper pioneered on the 1968 GTO) and was one of only three GM cars (Olds Cutlass Salon, Chevy Monte Carlo S) to debut radial-ply tires (RTS - Radial Tuned Suspension) as standard equipment. The intermediate sized Grand Am was canceled in 1980 when it was replaced by the Pontiac 6000.

A compact-sized Grand Am, based on the GM N-platform, was released in 1985, replacing the Pontiac Phoenix. It became Pontiac&#x27;s best selling car and was later replaced by the Pontiac G6, so named as it was intended to be the 6th generation of the Grand Am.

All 1973 through 1975 Grand Ams were built in Pontiac, Michigan at Pontiac&#x27;s main assembly plant. The 1978-1980 Grand Ams were built in Pontiac, Michigan at Pontiac&#x27;s main assembly plant and in Atlanta, Georgia at GMAD Lakewood. All Grand Ams between 1985 and 2005 were built in Lansing, Michigan at the Lansing Car Assembly.

==First generation (1973–1975)==
The history of Grand Am begins with Pontiac executives noting incursion into the US market by Mercedes, BMW, Toyota and Nissan. Notably, the American sports car was usually without luxury features, and the luxury car without sport features. Foreign makes mixed these features, that introduced the market to luxury performance coupes and sedans that had balanced handling along with powerful engines. Pontiac hybridized the Grand Prix with the Trans Am to create the Grand Am, a naming tactic shared with the luxury Pontiac Grand Ville. Built on the A-body platform shared with the Pontiac LeMans, the intended GTO body was re-badged and fitted with the top-level Grand Prix interior, and using the larger engine from the Grand Prix, Bonneville and Grand Ville.

The original Grand Am was introduced in the fall of 1972 as a 1973 model. It was based on the GM A platform (A-body) along with other cars such as the Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and the Buick Century Gran Sport. The GM A-body platform had major design revisions in 1973 that included the elimination of pillarless hardtops due to proposed Federal rollover standards, but with frameless windows similar to that of a hardtop. No convertibles were produced due to the rollover standards (that were not enacted). In addition to Federal emissions regulations, new safety standards required a impact-resistant front bumper and a impact-resistant rear bumper, which increased to for 1974.

The 1973 oil crisis caused a dichotomy of buyers: total luxury or total economy. Since Grand Am was an &quot;in-between&quot;, its sales declined and the model was discontinued in 1975.

===1973===

The Grand Am, coined by Pontiac with a name derived from two other cars in its lineup (&quot;Grand&quot; signifying &quot;Grand Prix luxury&quot; and &quot;Am&quot; for &quot;Trans Am performance&quot;) was designed as America&#x27;s answer to European luxury/sport sedans and available as a four-door Colonnade sedan or a two-door Colonnade coupe. A total of 43,136 Grand Ams were built during the first year of production.

The Grand Am could be had with a standard 2-bbl V8 engine with single exhaust producing , an optional 4-bbl version of this engine with single exhaust producing that was only available with a 4-speed manual transmission, an optional 4-bbl version of this engine with dual exhaust producing , or an optional 4-bbl with dual exhaust . The engine displacement, expressed in liters, was displayed on the bootlid in an effort to accentuate the car&#x27;s supposedly European character.

All engines were available with a Turbo-hydramatic 400 automatic transmission as standard equipment. A 4-speed manual transmission was available with the 400/4-bbl engine in 1973 and 1974, but this was not popular.

The 1973 Pontiac Grand Am style had a unique flexible urethane front fascia center nose (known as the &#x27;Endura&#x27; nose) that was squeezable and could return to its original shape following a minor collision along with the new energy-absorbing bumpers, a total of six grille openings with vertical bars, round front turn signals with a cross-hair design, horizontal rear taillights, and chrome rear bumper. Additionally, Grand Ams featured a Radial Tuned Suspension (RTS) as standard equipment that included radial-ply tires, Pliacell shock absorbers, and front and rear sway bars. The springs were advertised as being computer selected. The Grand Am was one of only three GM cars to have standard radial tires and appropriate suspension tuning in 1973, with the others being the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon and Chevrolet Monte Carlo S.

The Grand Am included Strato bucket seats upholstered in Naugahyde vinyl or corduroy cloth featuring manual recliners and adjustable lumbar supports - both features common on European-style sports/luxury sedans, but unusual for American cars of that time. Also included were an instrument panel from the Pontiac Grand Prix featuring a Rally gauge cluster with fuel, oil, water and volt gauges (a tachometer or fuel economy gauge was optional, and on cars so equipped, the clock was moved to a space on the lower instrument panel under the radio), three-spoke padded steering wheel with brushed-stainless spokes, and Genuine Crossfire African Mahogany trim on the dash facing, radio and clock surrounds, as well as the center console between the front seats. Grand Ams also were among the first U.S.-built cars with a turn-signal mounted headlight dimmer switch that had been common on imported cars for decades. Other standard equipment included concealed windshield wipers, a front stabilizer bar, and an in-the-windshield radio antenna. Upscale options included air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows-locks-seat, rear defogger, various sound systems, and tilt-steering-wheel. AM/FM stereo with a tape player was optional. The listed retail price for the 2-door coupe was US$4,264 ($ in dollars ), listing it above the Firebird Trans Am.

Pontiac also produced a single 1973 Grand Am station wagon as a feasibility study. This was a LeMans wagon converted to a Grand Am. A functional ram-air induction system was developed for the Pontiac A-bodies utilizing twin NACA openings in the hood, but the option was dropped due to the inability to pass federally mandated drive-by noise standards. A few functional Ram Air systems were sold over the counter. The twin-scoop NACA hood was an option for any Pontiac A-body for all three years, but was non-functional.

In a &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; Owners survey, 67% rated the build quality as good to excellent and 79% liked the handling. However, 22.1% disliked the fuel economy.

===1974===
Described as &quot;The mid-sized Pontiac with Foreign Intrigue ... American Ingenuity&quot; on the front cover of the four-page 1974 Grand Am brochure that featured a green four-door sedan, only minor styling changes highlighted this year&#x27;s model including a redesigned nose and grille with 12 openings with horizontal bars. The 1974 Grand Am&#x27;s rear-end styling was redesigned for the new 5 mph crash standards and had vertical rear taillights with relocated license plate and fuel filler above the bumper. Engine and transmission offerings were the same as 1973, but four-speed manual transmissions were no longer offered in California, where only the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic was available. Inside, the genuine African crossfire mahogany trim on the instrument panel was replaced by a simulated material due to delamination problems on the 1973 models but the real wood was continued on the center console, optional console clock, and radio bezel.

Engine choices were 2-barrel single exhaust producing , 400 cubic inch 4-barrel single exhaust producing , 400 cubic inch 4-barrel dual exhaust producing , and 455 cubic inch 4-barrel dual exhaust producing .

Sales were down more than 50 percent due to the 1973 oil crisis, and while the recession continued, prices increased for all 1974 model cars. Only 17,083 Grand Ams were built.

===1975===
The 1975 Grand Am looked the same as the 1974 model, but had vertical front grille bars, a body-colored rear bumper, and a catalytic converter single-exhaust, which mandated the use of unleaded fuel, along with GM&#x27;s High Energy Ignition and other items promoted as part of Pontiac&#x27;s maximum mileage system. In addition to the standard roofline with louvered rear side windows, Grand Am coupes with the optional vinyl roof could be ordered with a full triangular rear side window or a vertical opera window similar to that found on the Grand Prix.

Inside, the Strato bucket seats received revised vertical trim patterns, the adjustable lumbar support controls were dropped, and only the passenger seat had a recliner, a &quot;safety practice&quot; which would continue at GM for a decade. New this year as a no-cost option was a 60/40 bench seat with a center armrest.

Engines were also detuned to meet the 1975 emission regulations with the compression ratio dropping to a new low of 7.6 to 1 on some engines. Standard was the V8 with two-barrel carburetor, optional were a 400, or a - both with four-barrel carburetors. Turbo Hydra-matic was standard equipment and the only transmission offered this year. Performance from 0-60 was 7.7 seconds.

A total of 10,679 Grand Ams were built in 1975 and the series was dropped after this year due to declining sales and rising gas prices as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. Another factor leading to the Grand Am&#x27;s cancellation were plans for all 1976 Pontiac A-body cars receiving the newly approved rectangular headlights, which would necessitate a complete redesign of the Grand Am&#x27;s Endura nose and Pontiac officials decided that the expense of such a redesign could not be justified based on low production numbers. The basic GM A-body design remained until 1977.

==Second generation (1978–1980)==
===1978===
For 1978 the Grand Am nameplate returned on a downsized model using the Grand Prix&#x27;s G platform. It was offered in both two- and four-door models featuring a vertical bar grille and other trimmings to differentiate it from the LeMans, upon which it was based. Like the 1973–1975 models, this generation of Grand Ams also featured standard radial tires plus an upgraded Radial Tuned Suspension with front and rear sway bars. Interiors were similar to the Grand LeMans with either a standard notchback bench seat, optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console and recliner on passenger side, an optional tachometer, and a choice of either cloth or &quot;Morrokide&quot; vinyl upholstery.

Standard equipment included power steering, power front disc brakes, Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, full instrumentation and Pontiac&#x27;s V8 engine with two-barrel carburetor producing . Optional was a 4-bbl version, along with numerous extra cost items such as snowflake wheels, whitewall or white-lettered tires, power windows and seats, tilt steering wheel, sunroof, and cruise control.

In California, where more stringent emission regulations made Pontiac V8 engines unavailable since 1977, Chevrolet V8 engines were substituted including a standard V8 with two-barrel carburetor or optional four-barrel version with .

===1979===

Very few changes were made for 1979 other than the normal trim revisions and the demotion of the standard powertrain to a Buick V6 and floor-mounted three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. The 301 V8, rated at with a two-barrel carburetor or with four-barrel, and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission were now optional. In terms of appearance, the only difference was that the park/signal and marker lenses were changed to amber ones.

New for 1979 was a four-speed manual available with the 150-horsepower 301 four-barrel in 49 states. In California, only an automatic transmission was available and engine offerings included the standard Buick V6 engine with two-barrel carburetor and or optional Chevrolet 305 V8 rated at with four-barrel carb.

The wood-grained instrument panel was replaced by brushed aluminum trim, while the gauge faces changed from silver with black letters and numbers to black with white letters and numbers. The same seating choices in either cloth or Morrokide trims were offered including the standard notchback bench seat, or optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console. An AM/FM CB radio combo was available and a heated rear window was optional.

In 1979, the Grand Am was featured in the NASCAR Grand National circuit.

===1980===

1980 was the final year for the second-generation Grand Am. The four-door sedan was dropped, leaving only the two-door coupe, which received minor appearance changes including the grille. Strato bucket seats in cloth or Morrokide upholstery were standard equipment along with a center console with floor shifter for the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission.

The V6 engine, two-barrel V8s and manual transmissions were dropped leaving the four-barrel Pontiac 301 V8 with the only engine offered in 49 states or, in California, the Chevrolet 305 V8. Slow sales of the Grand Am led to its discontinuation after the 1980 model year.

In the first year of the NASCAR Busch Series (1982) the championship was won by Jack Ingram in a 1980 Grand Am.

==Third generation (1985–1991)==
For the 1985 model year, Pontiac reused the Grand Am name for a new compact car to replace the aging and unpopular Phoenix (based on GM&#x27;s X Body) using the new-for-1985 N Body. The Grand Am shared the same front-wheel drive platform as the Buick Somerset (renamed Skylark in 1987) and the Oldsmobile Calais (renamed Cutlass Calais in 1988). Initially, the Grand Am was available in base or LE trim in coupes only. The 2.5 L Tech IV was standard, while a 3.0 L Buick V6 was optional. A 5-speed manual was standard, and a 3-speed automatic was optional, the latter required if the V6 engine was ordered. In 1986, a sedan and sportier SE trim were added. The SE trim had the V6 engine standard, lower body cladding, composite headlamps, a slightly revised interior with the different cloth used on all seats and door panel inserts, analog instrumentation (base and LE models had digital), and included 14-inch aluminum wheels.

1987 models brought more power to the base engine, and a new Turbocharged four-cylinder engine taken from the Sunbird GT. The 2.0 L turbo engine became the base engine for the SE model for 1987. Cars with the turbo engine received a turbo boost gauge in the place of the voltmeter. A test by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; for quarter-mile acceleration with the Turbo engine resulted with the 5-speed manual taking 15.73 seconds and 16.02 seconds with the automatic transmission. They noted large amounts of torque steer from a dead stop. This was also the last year that the Buick sourced 3.0 L engine would be available in the Grand Am, as it was discontinued in mid-1987. New for styling were composite front headlights, but only on the LE models.

For 1988, front seat belts were moved from the b-pillars to the doors, to meet the passive restraint mandate for 1989. The &quot;LD2&quot; engine became available for Grand Am&#x27;s in 1988, replacing the previous model year&#x27;s 3.0 L V6 on the options list. It is worth noting that &#x27;Sport buckets&#x27; borrowed from the Trans Am GTA, were added to the options list this year for SE&#x27;s. Other options included a Driver Information Center, an electric trunk release, and a moon roof. The base model was dropped after this model year.

A totally new front and rear fascia along with an interior redesign for 1989. The 2.5 L gained balance shafts and an increase of power. The 2.3 L &#x27;LD2&#x27; Quad 4 replaced the 2.0 L Turbo engine as standard equipment in the SE midway through the year. This was the final year that the &#x27;Sport Bucket&#x27; seats were available to SEs.

The 2.3 L &quot;LG0&quot; Quad 4 was announced as being available late in the model year on Grand Am SE&#x27;s with only 200 were built. All 1989 &quot;LG0&quot; Quad 4 Grand Am&#x27;s were red on grey coupes, with standard appointments including (but not limited to) 16-inch machined-face wheels. The 16-inch wheels were only optional to SE&#x27;s. This would be the first year that the Grand A-inch could be ordered with either 16-inch wheels or a factory-installed CD player.

NHSTA safety ratings for frontal crashes are as follows: Driver: 3-stars; Passenger: 4-stars.

Changes were minor for 1990 and 1991; 
For 1990, a new High-Output version of the Quad 4 (mated to only a 5-speed manual) became the standard engine for the SE. Opting for the automatic transmission changed the engine to the less powerful &quot;LD2&quot; Quad 4. The 16-inch wheels moved from the option list to standard equipment for the SE&#x27;s this year. The LE gained a &#x27;Sport Performance Package&#x27; (RPO: W32) late in the 1990 model year run. The W32 option included SE ground effects (minus wheel well flares), the same standard (as well as optional) &quot;SE&quot; drive train, 14-inch aluminum wheels, a larger front larger sway bar, and a rear swaybar that were only otherwise available on the SE model. 1991 was the final model year of this body style and it was essentially a carry-over year. The only changes were the addition of an Anti-lock Brakes System (ABS) as standard equipment for all Grand Am SE&#x27;s (not available to LE&#x27;s), and all 1991 model year cars fitted with a 5-speed transmission received a redesigned &quot;short throw&quot; shifter.

For 1992 the Grand Am entered its fourth generation.

*1985–1991: 3T40 3-speed automatic (not available on HO Quad 4)
==Fourth generation (1992–1998)==
For 1992 the Grand Am&#x27;s N-body platform was widened to match the Corsica&#x27;s; the suspension and braking systems are about eighty percent in common. On the SE, an anti-lock braking system (ABS VI) was available. It also received new bodywork and a revised interior. A V6 option returned in the form of the 3.3 L 3300 V6, mated to a three-speed transmission. The 2.3 L I4 came as either a SOHC or DOHC. A high output version of the DOHC was offered as well. A new GT trim was offered that featured new wheels, smoother, yet larger cladding, and more standard equipment.

1993 brought further refinement to the Quad 4. This resulted in a loss of to all engines. In 1994, the V6 and standard 3-speed powertrain were effectively replaced by GM&#x27;s new 3.1 L 3100 series V6 engine and new 4-speed automatic transmission. A driver&#x27;s side airbag also became standard for 1994, but the door-mounted automatic seatbelts remained. In 1995, the Quad 4 engines received balance shafts and direct driven power steering off the intake camshaft. The 4-speed automatic that was mated to the 3.1 L in 1994 became optional as a step-up from the 3-speed for 1995 on the new Quad 4 engine.

In Japan, this generation was officially imported by Yanase and Suzuki with left-hand drive. The main imports were the SE and V6 models. The V6 model, however, was only offered for the 1996 model year there. All models had a three-speed (later 4-speed) automatic transmission.

===1996–1998===
For 1996, the Grand Am received a mid-generation facelift. Outside, an updated front fascia, rear fascia, and side skirts gave the Grand Am a smoother, more rounded look. The interior was redesigned and featured dual airbags, easier to use audio system and HVAC controls, and softer plastics. The Quad 4 was replaced by a new &#x27;Twin Cam&#x27; 2.4 L DOHC (Dual Over Head Cam) four-cylinder engine. Still based on the Quad 4, this was a re-engineered version of the previous year&#x27;s 2.3 L with SFI fuel injection. The new engine made of torque at lower rpm than the older 2.3 L. The 3.1 L V6 remained optional. The 3-speed automatic was dropped for 1996, and the 4-speed automatic featured standard traction control. Daytime running lamps with automatic lighting control were newly standard on all Grand Ams. 1997 models featured standard air conditioning. The Grand Am was redesigned for 1999.

Available engines:
* 1992–1994: 2.3 L SOHC L40 I4. 120 hp (115 in 1993 and 1994), of torque

==Fifth generation (1999–2005)==
Available in late spring 1998, the basic design of the fifth-generation Grand Am was shared with the Oldsmobile Alero (also new for 1999) and Chevrolet Malibu (introduced in 1996). The length was shortened slightly, but the wheelbase grew by more than three inches (76 mm). The suspension was now fully independent, with a revised MacPherson-Strut design upfront. The rear suspension is a more refined Multi-link design. The new Grand Am was offered in five trim levels: SE, SE1, SE2, GT, and GT1. The 2.4 L Twin Cam engine was carried over, with and of torque. GM&#x27;s 3400 V6, previously exclusive to their minivans, became available as an option on the SE and SE1 and was standard on all other trim levels. For 1999, all the Grand Ams featured a 4-speed automatic transmission. The GT and GT1 also included 4-wheel disc brakes, and all Grand Ams until 2003 included standard ABS and Traction Control (made optional on SE from 2003). The GTs also had a Ram Air induction system, providing an extra five horsepower and 5 lb/ft of torque over the 3.4 L V6 when installed in any of the SE-level trims.

The 2000 models added a Getrag 5-speed manual transmission as standard equipment with the four-cylinder. On GT models, the badge on the front fenders now read &quot;RamAir V6&quot;, instead of &quot;V6H.O.&quot; on 1999 GT&#x27;s. ASC Creative Services designed the Grand Am SC/T for the SEMA show circuit, which was the concept design for the Ram Air hood and body package. The SC/T later became an appearance package, beginning in 2003. A road test by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; showed a 0-60 mph time of 7.7 seconds in a GT sedan with an automatic.

For 2001, the SE2 trim level was dropped, a new family of Delco stereos and new wheel designs was introduced. The radio size in 2001 also changed from a 1.5 DIN size to a full 2 DIN size. Halfway through 2002, the Twin Cam 2.4 L engine was replaced by a new 2.2 L &quot;Ecotec&quot; four-cylinder, which had improvements over the engine it replaced, but produced less output; and of torque. Changes for 2002 also included a stationary cup holder in the center console as opposed to a removable one.

The body cladding on SE models was removed in 2003, a change which affected other models throughout Pontiac. Also in 2003, anti-lock brakes and traction control were made optional on the SE. In 2004, an MP3 player was added to the uplevel CD player. In 2005, Pontiac began phasing out the Grand Am lineup for the new G6 replacement. SE sedans were retained for fleet sale and GT coupes were the last Grand Am model available for public sale.

Available engines:
*1999–2002: 2.4 L DOHC Twin Cam L4 (LD9 model) engine: , of torque
*2002–2005: 2.2 L DOHC Ecotec L4 engine: , of torque
*1999–2005: 3.4 L 3400 OHV V6: 170 hp,(175 for GT) of torque (205 for GT)

Available transmissions:
*1999–2005: 4-speed automatic with overdrive (4T40-E for four-cylinder engines, 4T45-E for V6 engines)
*2000–2005: Getrag 5-speed manual with overdrive (four-cylinder engines only)

===Safety===
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gives the 1999-2005 Grand Am a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in its frontal crash test for marginal structural integrity, a possible head injury, a potential right leg injury, and poor dummy control.

2003 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Crash Test Ratings (coupe):

<text>A Millennium stamp is a postage stamp issued by a postal administration commemorating a millennium associated with that country&#x27;s history but several countries issued stamps for the beginning of the 3rd millennium in same cases depicting some of their country&#x27;s achievements over the preceding years.
==Canada==

Canada Post released 68 specially designed stamps as a series of 17 Millennium souvenir sheets, each depicting four different stamps, starting 17 December 1999 through to 17 March 2000. It is not clear, at the present date, whether these issues were justified by any rational policy – or, perhaps, may have been primarily to raise cash from collectors – seventeen four-stamp sets in about thirteen weeks.

==Fiji==
Fiji released a series of eight stamps depicting some of the flora and fauna of the island nation, being concepts by four artists, Joe Nasau, Jane Borg, Muni Deo Raj and fourteen-year-old Myron Williams.

===1999===

In 1999 Royal Mail issued a series of stamps that were classified into 12 groups (known as &quot;tales&quot;) including Entertainment, Science &amp; Technology and Sport, with one group released in each month during the year. The set issued in September 1999 called &quot;The Farmers&#x27; Tale&quot; contained a 19p stamp that doubled as Royal Mail&#x27;s contribution to that year&#x27;s Europa postage stamp issue, which was on the theme of Parks and Reserves.

One of the most notable postage stamps in the collection was one commemorating the life of Queen frontman (and avid stamp collector) Freddie Mercury. It caused controversy for the appearance of Roger Taylor in the background at the drums, as it was an understood rule at the time that the only living people allowed to appear on British stamps could be members of the British Royal Family. However, Sir Francis Chichester had appeared on a Royal Mail postage stamp, while still alive, in 1967.

Other stamps featured: English football hero Bobby Moore; a picture of the structure of DNA; and a fossil of Archaeopteryx, the first known bird.

The pack called &quot;Entertainers&#x27; Tale&quot; was – 19p : Freddie Mercury (photo, Mercury&#x27;s Magic/P Blake); 26p : Bobby Moore (artwork, World Cup/M White); 44p : Dalek (photo, Doctor Who/Lord Snowdon) and 64p : Charlie Chaplin (artwork, Chaplin&#x27;s Genius/Ralph Steadman).

The stamps featured such projects as the Eden Project, the Tate Modern art gallery, the National Space Centre and the Scottish Seabird Centre.

<text>Newbold-on-Avon (usually shortened to just Newbold) is a suburb of Rugby in Warwickshire, England, located around 1½ miles north-west of the town centre, it is adjacent to the River Avon from which the suffix is derived. Newbold was historically a village in its own right, but was incorporated into Rugby in 1932. The name is derived from the Saxon &quot;Niowebold&quot; (&#x27;New house&#x27;). 

The ancient parish of Newbold-on-Avon contained the nearby settlements of Harborough Parva, Cosford, Long Lawford and Little Lawford. The latter three became separate civil parishes in the 19th century, while Harborough Parva was transferred to Harborough Magna parish in 1931. In 1931 the parish had a population of 696. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Rugby and Harborough Magna.

The older part of the village of Newbold sits on a hill north of the River Avon on the B4112 road, and contains some old buildings, including some red brick 18th-century houses and some timber-framed buildings from the 17th century. The church of St Botolph in the old village dates from the 15th century, and is grade I listed and stands on the site of an earlier church. Newbold grew considerably during the 20th century, with a number of modern housing and industrial estates having been built to the east of the old village at the foot of the hill, around the Avon valley.

The Oxford Canal runs immediately to the north of Newbold, here it runs through the 250-metre-long Newbold Tunnel. This tunnel was built in 1829 as part of a scheme to straighten out the winding canal, and it replaced an older tunnel which dated from 1777 on the original route, which ran at a right-angle to the newer tunnel. The southern portal of the abandoned tunnel can be seen next to the churchyard, it is now bricked up but with two holes to allow for bats to enter. There is a canalside pub at Newbold, the &quot;Barley Mow&quot; (a second one &quot;The Boat&quot; having now closed). There is also another pub called the &quot;Newbold Crown&quot; closer to the centre of the village.

There are some former limestone quarries in the Newbold area. One of them has been converted into a nature reserve, known as Newbold Quarry Park. Another park named Newbold Centenary Park opened in 2016 off Parkfield Road: built on the site of former allotments, it was so named to mark the centenary of the First World War. 

The main secondary school in Newbold is the Avon Valley School, which was formerly known as Newbold Grange High School until the early-1990s. Newbold is home to Newbold-on-Avon RFC.

<doc id="1270051" wikidata="Q713240" url="?curid=1270051" title="Lionel Terray">
<text>Lionel Terray (25 July 1921 – 19 September 1965) was a French climber who made many first ascents, including on the 1955 French Makalu expedition in the Himalaya (with Jean Couzy on 15 May 1955) and Cerro Fitz Roy in the Patagonian Andes (with Guido Magnone in 1952).

A climbing guide and ski instructor, Terray was active in mountain combat against Germany during World War II. After the war, he became well known as one of the best Chamonix climbers and guides, noted for his speedy ascents of some of the most notorious climbs in the French, Italian, and Swiss Alps: the Walker Spur of the Grandes Jorasses, the south face of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey, the north-east face of Piz Badile, and the north face of the Eiger. Terray, frequently with climbing partner Louis Lachenal, broke previous climbing speed records.

Terray was a member of Maurice Herzog&#x27;s 1950 expedition to the Nepalese Himalayan peak, Annapurna, the highest peak climbed at the time, and the first 8000-meter peak climbed (although British climbers George Mallory, Andrew Irvine, George Finch, Geoffrey Bruce, Henry Morshead, Teddy Norton and Howard Somervell had reached higher altitudes on Mount Everest during the 1920s). Terray did not reach the summit of Annapurna, but together with the Sherpa Adjiba he aided summiteers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal down from the mountain. Both Herzog and Lachenal experienced extreme frostbite and subsequently underwent amputations.
Despite these events, the French team returned to Paris to huge public acclaim, and Herzog&#x27;s expedition book &quot;Annapurna&quot; became an international bestseller.

Terray made the second ascent of the North Face of the Eiger in 1947, with Louis Lachenal. He was also one of the main participants in the great attempt to rescue four climbers trapped on the north face of the Eiger in 1957. This mission forms the subject of Jack Olsen&#x27;s 1962 book, &quot;The Climb Up To Hell&quot;, in which Terray&#x27;s skill and bravery receive special mention.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Terray made a number of first ascents in Peru, including the highest unclimbed peak in the central Andes at the time, Huantsan. He also made first ascents of lower but more difficult peaks, including Willka Wiqi, Soray, Tawllirahu, and Chakrarahu/Chacraraju, possibly the hardest peak in the Peruvian Andes and considered unclimbable at the time. One of Terray&#x27;s finest achievements was the first ascent of Jannu in Nepal in 1962. He also climbed the Nilgiris near Annapurna, and led the successful 1964 first ascent of Mount Huntington, in the Alaska Range, by the northwest ridge.

Terray organised a rescue attempt of two climbers stranded on Mont Blanc in December 1956. For this he was expelled from the Chamonix Guide&#x27;s Association, which had refused to participate in the rescue from the start on the grounds that the risk to the rescuers would be too great. Due to the fact that no other guides would accompany him, Terray set out a small team of amateurs. They were turned back on 1 January 1957 either by poor weather or on the understanding that a helicopter would attempt a rescue the following day. Terray was highly critical of the Chamonix Guide Association&#x27;s inaction when the alarm had first been raised.

Terray was fatally injured from a fall while climbing in the Vercors, south of Grenoble, on 19 September 1965, several years after the publication of his climbing memoir, &quot;Conquistadors of the Useless&quot;. There were rumors that Terray was functionally illiterate and the book was ghost-written; however in a Foreword written by author and climber David Roberts to an English edition, he confirms he found the original manuscript written in Terray&#x27;s hand which is word for word what was published, dispelling any notion that Terray did not write the book entirely himself.

His grave is situated in Chamonix, France. A traffic circle is named for him in Chamonix, WSW of town.

<doc id="1270052" wikidata="Q1121044" url="?curid=1270052" title="Union of Krewo">
<text>In a strict sense, the Union of Krewo or Act of Krėva (also spelled Union of Krevo, Act of Kreva; ; ) comprised a set of prenuptial promises made at Kreva Castle on 14 August 1385 by Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, in regard to his prospective marriage to the underage reigning Queen Jadwiga of Poland. 

Though very limited in scope, the &quot;Union of Krewo&quot;, in historiography, often refers not only to the particular document but to events of 1385–1386 as a whole. After the 1385 negotiations, Jogaila converted to Christianity, married Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland in 1386. 

The union proved a decisive moment in the histories of Poland and Lithuania; it marked the beginning of four centuries of shared history of the two polities. By 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian union had developed into a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.

==Background==

===Situation in Poland===

Louis I of Hungary died on 10 September 1382. Since he had only two surviving daughters, Mary (born ca. 1371) and Jadwiga (born ca. 1373), Poland faced a succession crisis. Candidates for the throne included Mary&#x27;s fiancé Sigismund of Luxembourg, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, and Vladislaus II of Opole. Mary and her fiancé were rejected by the Polish nobles, who did not wish to continue a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary. Polish nobles competed with each other and a brief civil war broke out in Greater Poland. Eventually, after long negotiations with Jadwiga&#x27;s mother Elizabeth of Bosnia, who was regent of Hungary, Jadwiga arrived in Kraków and was crowned as King of Poland (not as Queen of Poland, to emphasize her rights to the throne) on 15 October 1384. The new monarch still needed a suitable husband. She was betrothed to William of Austria, who in summer 1385 traveled to Poland in an attempt to consummate the proposed marriage and present a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. He succeeded in reaching Wawel, but was forcibly removed by Polish nobles. It is unclear whether he succeeded in consummating the marriage, but biased Austrian sources continued to accuse Jadwiga of bigamy. Nobles from Lesser Poland, including Spytek of Melsztyn, Jan of Tarnów, and Jan Tęczyński, proposed that Jadwiga marry Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania.

===Situation in Lithuania===
Grand Duke Algirdas died in 1377 and left the throne to his son Jogaila. He inherited a large state, inhabited by pagan Lithuanians and Orthodox Ruthenians. For the last century, Lithuanians defended themselves from the Teutonic Knights, a crusading military order dedicated to conversion of the Grand Duchy into Catholicism. Jogaila understood that the conversion was inevitable and searched for the best opportunities. The Treaty of Dubysa of 1382 with the Knights included provisions of Jogaila&#x27;s conversion within four years. However, the treaty was never ratified. Accepting Christianity from a long-standing enemy was dangerous, unpopular, and could push Lithuania into dependence of the Knights. In 1384, Jogaila explored another option, presented by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and brokered by his Orthodox mother Uliana of Tver: converting to Orthodoxy and marrying Sophia, daughter of Dmitry Donskoy. However, in the eyes of Catholics, Orthodoxy was not any better than paganism. Therefore, such conversion would not protect from the Teutonic attacks. A third option, presented by Polish nobles, avoided major pitfalls of the Teutonic or Muscovite proposals.

===Negotiations===

The relations between Poland and Lithuania were not particularly friendly. The two states were allies before, when Jogaila&#x27;s aunt Aldona of Lithuania was Queen of Poland between 1325 and 1339. Poland and Lithuania battled each other in the decades-long Galicia–Volhynia Wars, but also saw opportunities to regain lands lost to Hungary and regarded the Teutonic Knights as the common enemy. It is unknown who and when proposed Jogaila as the groom for Jadwiga. Some hints show that planning and negotiations might have started as early as 1383. For example, Jogaila attacked Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, when he advanced his claims for the Polish throne. By the time Lithuanian envoys participated in Jadwiga&#x27;s coronation in fall 1384, Jogaila&#x27;s candidacy was widely known.

In mid-1385, Jogaila sent an official delegation to Poland. It included his brother Skirgaila, Duke Boris (possibly his cousin and son of Karijotas), and merchant Hanul of Riga. Hanul helped Jogaila to recapture Vilnius during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) and represented interests of merchants, who saw great trade potential between Poland and Lithuania. The representatives first appeared before the Polish nobles in Kraków and then before Queen Elizabeth, Jadwiga&#x27;s mother, in Buda. A Polish delegation – two Elizabeth&#x27;s envoys and three Polish nobles – was sent to Lithuania. Upon return of the Lithuanian delegation, Jogaila confirmed in writing all the promises, made on his behalf in Poland. This confirmation is known today as the Union of Krewo.

===Content===
The 560-word document is addressed to Queen Elizabeth and the Polish delegation. Jogaila briefly described the mission of the Lithuanian delegation and, in exchange for marriage to Jadwiga, agreed to the following:
* Christianizing Lithuania: conversion of pagan Jogaila, Lithuanian nobles and all pagan Lithuanians to Roman Catholicism
* paying compensation of 200,000 florins to William, Duke of Austria for the termination of the engagement between Jadwiga and William
* returning of all lands lost in wars by Poland. This in particular referred to territories in Red Ruthenia that Louis I of Hungary attached to the Kingdom of Hungary.
* releasing of all 40,000 or 45,000 Christians war prisoners of Poland held by the Lithuanians
* attaching (Latin: &quot;applicare&quot;) of Lithuanian and Ruthenian lands to the Crown of Poland

It was guaranteed by the seals of Jogaila&#x27;s brothers Skirgaila, Kaributas, Lengvenis and their cousin Vytautas. Because the document contained promises and guarantees only by one party, Lithuanian historian Jūratė Kiaupienė concluded that the union could not have been a final international treaty and that there should have been another document finalizing the agreement.

==Aftermath==

===Marriage and conversion of Lithuania===

On 11 January 1386 a Polish delegation met Jogaila in Vawkavysk and presented him with a pre-election pact, declaring that the Polish nobility agreed to elect him as their new king. The election was concluded on 1 February in Lublin. On 12 February Jogaila and his relatives arrived in Kraków and were baptized by Bodzanta, Bishop of Gniezno, three days later in the Wawel Cathedral. Jogaila&#x27;s new baptismal name Wladislaus was chosen in honor of Jadwiga&#x27;s great-grandfather king Władysław I the Elbow-high, the penultimate Piast. Jogaila married Jadwiga on 18 February and was crowned &quot;jure uxoris&quot; as King of Poland on 4 March. Due to negative propaganda by William of Austria and the Teutonic Knights, the marriage was not confirmed by Pope Urban VI (1378–1389); only Pope Boniface IX (1389–1404) declared it legitimate.

Right after the marriage and coronation, Jadwiga and Vytautas marched to Galicia where they defeated Hungarian forces and secured some in western Podolia. Andrei of Polotsk, Jogaila&#x27;s eldest brother, used his absence to renew struggle for the throne of Lithuania. Andrei attacked southeast of Polotsk, the Livonian Order attacked Duchy of Lithuania, and Sviatoslav of Smolensk attacked Mstsislaw. The rebellion was quickly subdued.

At the end of 1386 Jogaila returned to Vilnius to carry out his other promise – to convert the Grand Duchy to Catholicism. He brought some priests, established the first seven parishes, and, according to Jan Długosz, even personally translated Lord&#x27;s Prayer and Apostles&#x27; Creed into the Lithuanian language. New converts were baptized &quot;en masse&quot;, with little teaching, and were awarded wool shirts; the haste was later criticized at the Council of Constance. On 17 February 1387 Jogaila decreed that he would build Vilnius Cathedral and petition the pope to establish the Diocese of Vilnius, which he awarded with land possessions in Tauragnai, Labanoras, Molėtai. Two other privileges, issues on 20 February and 4 March 1387, awarded nobles who would convert to Christianity with new rights and granted Magdeburg rights to Vilnius. This served not only as an incentive for conversion but also equalized nobility rights in Poland and Lithuania.

===Polish–Lithuanian union===
Jogaila left his brother Skirgaila as his regent in Lithuania. He proved to be unpopular and Lithuanian nobility resented growing Polish influence in the state. Vytautas seized the opportunity to renew his struggle for power and the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) broke out. This was resolved with the Ostrów Agreement – Vytautas became the Grand Duke of Lithuania while Jogaila retained rights of an overlord. Vytautas conducted independent internal and foreign affairs, but cooperated with Jogaila. A celebrated example of the Polish–Lithuanian cooperation was the decisive victory in the Battle of Grunwald (1410) against the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas&#x27;s independence and Polish–Lithuanian relations were formalized by the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and Union of Horodło (1413). Thus the Grand Duchy of Lithuania retained its sovereignty. Only the Union of Lublin (1569) created a permanent union between Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after which the federal state Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established.

Finally, the Constitution of 3 May 1791 declared that both states were one, albeit that this was denounced in 20 October amendments (the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations). Soon after, they were separated in form, spending most of the 19th century under Russian control but kept administratively separate. In the early 20th century, both states established their independence and since then, they have had no ties with each other in any formal sense.

==Historiography==
Up until the discovery of the original document in 1835 in a register in the Archives of the Cracow Cathedral Chapter, the Union of Krewo was unknown. Usually, important state documents were archived at the Crown Archive. It was neither referenced in any contemporary documents nor cited by medieval historians. No chronicles or other written sources mentioned the August 1385 meeting in Kreva. That led the Lithuanian American lawyer Jonas Dainauskas to question the act&#x27;s authenticity in 1975. However, his claims have gained little scholarly support.

===&quot;Applicare&quot;===
In the 1385 document, the Latin word &quot;applicare&quot;, describing a future relationship between Poland and Lithuania, has caused the most controversy and academic debate. The Latin term does not have a legal definition and possibly was deliberately chosen for its vagueness. The term is subject to wide-ranging interpretations, which can be divided into three major categories of meaning:
*That Lithuania ceased to exist as a sovereign state and became a province of Poland. This interpretation was championed by the Polish historians Feliks Koneczny (1862–1949), Anatol Lewicki (1841–1899), Henryk Łowmiański (1898–1984), and Ludwik Kolankowski (1882–1956). This view was newly interpreted by Oskar Halecki (1891–1973), who argued that Lithuania was incorporated into Poland from 1386 to 1401 and became Poland&#x27;s fief to 1440.
*That Lithuania became a fief of Poland. This view was introduced by Jan Adamus (1896–1962) in 1932 and supported by Henryk Paszkiewicz (1897–1979) and to an extent by Oskar Halecki. Their main arguments was that such a large state could not suddenly became a province in reality and that the Grand Duchy preserved most elements of sovereignty.
*That Lithuania and Poland were united by a personal union. This view was introduced by the Lithuanian historians Adolfas Šapoka (1906–1961) and Zenonas Ivinskis (1908–1971). They argued that Poland and Lithuania were united only by the monarch.

<text>Empacher (company name Bootswerft Empacher [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]) is a manufacturer of boats. Today, they produce racing shells for the sport of rowing.

==History==

Originally building sailing yachts, Willy Empacher founded his boatyard with Wilhelm Karlisch during 1923 in Königsberg, East Prussia. The boatyard was the largest east of Berlin during the 1930s. They built boats for Germany during the war, but in 1945 the family fled their town and reached Eberbach, Germany in 1947.

Willy started a new business at the Seibert boat-yard in Eberbach repairing and making small boats. In 1952 they started producing racing rowing shells, an enterprise that has become their main business today. The business took off after Jochen Meißner won the silver medal while racing in an Empacher single scull during the 1968 Summer Olympics. They built mainly moulded cedarwood racing shells, but collaborated with BASF to produce the world&#x27;s first plastic shell in 1956. Empacher built the first plastic to receive a gold medal during the 1972 Munich Olympics. This was also the first race worthy sandwich-build plastic boat. This process includes using a wood frame to create the boat hull and then filling with it with composite material.

Hans Empacher, Willy&#x27;s eldest son, took over the business in 1970. Hans optimized the company by creating internal competition and promoting plastic boat construction. Upon the death of his brother Rainer in October 2018, Helmut Empacher became the sole owner of the business.

==Boats==

Boats built by Empacher are easily identified by their pale yellow color and black trim. Empacher produce every FISA-recognized racing boat category. The company tries to produce two new boat designs every year.

===Manufacturing===
Empacher, as all other racing shell manufacturers, have replaced wooden boats with carbon fibre and honeycomb sandwich constructions. The nomex honeycomb reinforces the kevlar/carbon fibre inner and outer frames. Empacher uses a vacuum bag technique to bond the outer layers with the honeycomb core. Combining kevlar and epoxy resin creates a tear and impact resistant outer shell. Empacher reinforces the gunwale with an additional carbon layer and carbon foam frames.

Empacher offers a wide range of boat moulds for each category (such as eights and coxless fours) and rigger options. Different molds suit different weight racing categories. A lightweight rowing team would use a different mould than an openweight team. Also depending on the team&#x27;s needs, classical multi-stay aluminium riggers, carbon two stay riggers of carbon fibre, aluminium wing rigger, and carbon wing riggers are offered. Wing riggers are used for sweep rowing.

===Successes===
Empacher rowing shells are used by a large number of crews rowing in international competitions, including World Championships and the Summer Olympics. Overall, Empacher boats have received 64% of the wins in all race categories during 2013.

In the eights, all crews but the USA (who used a Hudson) used Empacher boats during the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the 2012 London Olympics, Empacher boats won almost all boat categories with ten out of fourteen gold medals.

===Competition===
Other big racing shell manufacturers include companies such as: Hudson, WinTech, Pocock, Janousek, and Filippi.

<doc id="1270060" wikidata="Q5310006" url="?curid=1270060" title="DuPage Valley Conference">
<text>The DuPage Valley Conference (DVC) is an organization of six high schools in northeastern Illinois, representing seven communities in Chicago&#x27;s suburbs. These high schools are all members of the Illinois High School Association. The Conference, organized in 1975, exists primarily for inter-school athletic competition in 21 sports. There are also four non-athletic competitions in which DVC schools participate: Chess, Math competitions, Scholastic Bowl and Speech.

Four of the six current conference member schools are within DuPage County, Illinois. One school, Neuqua Valley High School, is located just to the south of Du Page in Will County, Illinois while DeKalb High School is located west of the other schools in DeKalb County, Illinois. The conference derives its name from the DuPage River, which flows through two of the seven represented communities (although students from towns on the DuPage River do attend more of the member schools, due to attendance boundaries).

==History==
The DuPage Valley Conference was formed prior to the 1975–76 school year. Its charter members were Glenbard North High School, Glenbard South High School, Naperville Central High School, Naperville North High School, West Chicago Community High School, Wheaton Central High School, Wheaton North High School, and Wheaton Warrenville High School. While the conference has typically kept a constant membership of at least six high schools, the actual membership of the Conference has changed since its founding. The conference experienced the first membership change in 1983, when Glenbard East High School left the Des Plaines Valley League and joined the DVC, replacing Wheaton-Warrenville High School, which was closed due to low attendance. The next change came in 1992, when Wheaton Central High School and Wheaton-Warrenville Middle School changed buildings. The high school (now in the former Wheaton-Warrenville high school building) became known as Wheaton-Warrenville South High School in order to distinguish it from the closed Wheaton-Warrenville; the middle school (in the old Wheaton Central building from 1992-2009) became Hubble Middle School. After the 1996 school year, Glenbard South High School left the DuPage Valley Conference, citing an inability to be competitive with the larger member schools in the league (despite winning a share of the conference title in softball in their final year in the conference). The DuPage Valley Conference operated for one year with only seven schools before admitting former Upstate Eight Conference member West Aurora High School in Aurora, Illinois, the first DVC school outside DuPage County. The move reunited West Aurora with former Upstate Eight charter members Naperville Central, and Wheaton-Warrenville South who were then known as Naperville Community, and Wheaton Community in 1963.

Effective at the start of the 2013-14 conference season, West Chicago Community High School left the DuPage Valley Conference and joined the Upstate Eight Conference (Valley Division). At the same time Lake Park High School took the vacant space after leaving the Upstate Eight Conference Valley Division.

Following suit with West Chicago Community High School, Glenbard East High School and West Aurora High School expressed interest in joining the Upstate Eight Conference. The two schools voted unanimously to accept the invitation to the Upstate Eight Conference starting in the 2014–2015 season. This effectively left the DVC as a 6 member high school conference. Glenbard North High School declined an invite from the Upstate Eight Conference to join.

Prior to the 2015–2016 school year, Metea Valley High School, Neuqua Valley High School, and Waubonsie Valley High School, all formerly of the Upstate Eight Conference Valley Division, accepted an invitation to join the DuPage Valley Conference, bringing the membership to 9 schools.

In late 2016, four members of the DVC, Glenbard North High School, Lake Park High School, Wheaton North High School, and Wheaton Warrenville South High School announced that they would be leaving the conference effective at the end of the 2017–18 school year to form a new athletic conference with current Upstate Eight (River Division) members Batavia High School, Geneva High School, St. Charles East High School, and St. Charles North High School. The conference is now known as the DuKane Conference.

The remaining DVC members Metea Valley, Naperville Central, Naperville North, Neuqua Valley, and Waubonsie Valley continued athletic competition in the DVC despite scheduling concerns, particularly for football.

DeKalb High School accepted an invitation to join the DVC for the 2019-2020 season following the break-up of the Northern Illinois Big 12 Conference.

In 2024–25, the DVC merged with Southwest Suburban Conference called &quot;Southwest Valley Conference&quot; for football only. The conference would create into 3 divisions, one consisting of 5 schools:
* Blue Division: Homewood-Flossomoor, Lincoln-Way East, Lockport, Naperville North and Neuqua Valley
* Red Division: Andrew, Lincoln-Way West, Metea Valley, Naperville Central and Sandburg
* Green Division: Bradley-Bourbonnais, DeKalb, Lincoln-Way Central, Stagg and Waubonsie Valley

<text>muMATH is a computer algebra system developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Albert D. Rich and David Stoutemyer of Soft Warehouse in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is implemented in the muSIMP programming language which is built on top of a LISP dialect called . It supports CP/M and TRS-DOS (since muMATH-79), Apple II (since muMATH-80) and MS-DOS (in muMATH-83, the final version, which was published by Microsoft).

The Soft Warehouse later developed Derive, another computer algebra system. The company was purchased by Texas Instruments in 1999, and development of Derive ended in 2006.

<text>The Bank of British North America was founded by royal charter issued in 1836 in London, England. British North America was the common name by which the British colonies and territories that now comprise Canada were known prior to 1867.

By 1899, the bank had branches in London, Brantford, Hamilton, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Midland, Quebec City, Saint John, N.B., Brandon, Winnipeg, Fredericton, Halifax, Victoria, Vancouver, Rossland, Kaslo, Trail, Ashcroft, Greenwood, Atlin, Bennett, B.C., and Dawson City. It was the first bank operating in British Columbia.

Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own bank notes, 1852 to 1911. The end dates are the final dates appearing on notes, which may have circulated for some time after. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency.

The Bank of British North America merged with the Bank of Montreal in 1918.

==Historic buildings==
On the Registry of Historical Places of Canada are the former Bank of British North America in Dawson, Yukon (1899) and Winnipeg, Manitoba (1903–04).

===49 Yonge Street, Toronto===

The first Toronto branch, designed by John George Howard was built in 1845, with exterior work by John Cochrane and Brothers, at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Wellington. The current building, designed by architect Henry Langley, replaced the original in 1875. A restaurant occupies the ground floor with offices above.

===276 Duckworth Street, St. John&#x27;s===

The former Bank of British North America in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, built in 1849 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. This bank building was constructed in 1849, after the St. John&#x27;s fire of 1846, by Halifax architect David Stirling. 
===1211 King Street West, Toronto===

The former branch constructed in 1906–07 at the southwest corner of King Street West and Dufferin Street in the Parkdale area of Toronto continued to operate as a branch of the Bank of Montreal until its closure in 2018.

<text>Pierre-Louis Lions (; born 11 August 1956) is a French mathematician. He is known for a number of contributions to the fields of partial differential equations and the calculus of variations. He was a recipient of the 1994 Fields Medal and the 1991 Prize of the Philip Morris tobacco and cigarette company.

==Biography==
Lions entered the École normale supérieure in 1975, and received his doctorate from the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1979. He holds the position of Professor of &quot;Partial differential equations and their applications&quot; at the Collège de France in Paris as well as a position at École Polytechnique. Since 2014, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of Chicago.

In 1979, Lions married Lila Laurenti, with whom he has one son. Lions&#x27; parents were Andrée Olivier and the renowned mathematician Jacques-Louis Lions, at the time a professor at the University of Nancy.

==Awards and honors==
In 1994, while working at the Paris Dauphine University, Lions received the International Mathematical Union&#x27;s prestigious Fields Medal. He was cited for his contributions to viscosity solutions, the Boltzmann equation, and the calculus of variations. He has also received the French Academy of Science&#x27;s Prix Paul Doistau–Émile Blutet (in 1986) and Ampère Prize (in 1992).

He was an invited professor at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers (2000). He is a doctor honoris causa of Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh), EPFL (2010), Narvik University College (2014), and of the City University of Hong-Kong and is listed as an ISI highly cited researcher.

==Mathematical work==
===Operator theory===
Lions&#x27; earliest work dealt with the functional analysis of Hilbert spaces. His first published article, in 1977, was a contribution to the vast literature on convergence of certain iterative algorithms to fixed points of a given nonexpansive self-map of a closed convex subset of Hilbert space. In collaboration with his thesis advisor Haïm Brézis, Lions gave new results about maximal monotone operators in Hilbert space, proving one of the first convergence results for Bernard Martinet and R. Tyrrell Rockafellar&#x27;s proximal point algorithm. In the time since, there have been a large number of modifications and improvements of such results.

With Bertrand Mercier, Lions proposed a &quot;forward-backward splitting algorithm&quot; for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators. Their algorithm can be viewed as an abstract version of the well-known Douglas−Rachford and Peaceman−Rachford numerical algorithms for computation of solutions to parabolic partial differential equations. The Lions−Mercier algorithms and their proof of convergence have been particularly influential in the literature on operator theory and its applications to numerical analysis. A similar method was studied at the same time by Gregory Passty.

===Calculus of variations===
The mathematical study of the steady-state Schrödinger–Newton equation, also called the &quot;Choquard equation&quot;, was initiated in a seminal article of Elliott Lieb. It is inspired by plasma physics via a standard approximation technique in quantum chemistry. Lions showed that one could apply standard methods such as the mountain pass theorem, together with some technical work of Walter Strauss, in order to show that a generalized steady-state Schrödinger–Newton equation with a radially symmetric generalization of the gravitational potential is necessarily solvable by a radially symmetric function.

The partial differential equation
:formula_1
has received a great deal of attention in the mathematical literature. Lions&#x27; extensive work on this equation is concerned with the existence of rotationally symmetric solutions as well as estimates and existence for boundary value problems of various type. In the interest of studying solutions on all of Euclidean space, where standard compactness theory does not apply, Lions established a number of compactness results for functions with symmetry. With Henri Berestycki and Lambertus Peletier, Lions used standard ODE shooting methods to directly study the existence of rotationally symmetric solutions. However, sharper results were obtained two years later by Berestycki and Lions by variational methods. They considered the solutions of the equation as rescalings of minima of a constrained optimization problem, based upon a modified Dirichlet energy. Making use of the Schwarz symmetrization, there exists a minimizing sequence for the infimization problem which consists of positive and rotationally symmetric functions. So they were able to show that there is a minimum which is also rotationally symmetric and nonnegative. By adapting the critical point methods of Felix Browder, Paul Rabinowitz, and others, Berestycki and Lions also demonstrated the existence of infinitely many (not always positive) radially symmetric solutions to the PDE. Maria Esteban and Lions investigated the nonexistence of solutions in a number of unbounded domains with Dirichlet boundary data. Their basic tool is a Pohozaev-type identity, as previously reworked by Berestycki and Lions. They showed that such identities can be effectively used with Nachman Aronszajn&#x27;s unique continuation theorem to obtain the triviality of solutions under some general conditions. Significant &quot;a priori&quot; estimates for solutions were found by Lions in collaboration with Djairo Guedes de Figueiredo and Roger Nussbaum.

In more general settings, Lions introduced the &quot;concentration-compactness principle&quot;, which characterizes when minimizing sequences of functionals may fail to subsequentially converge. His first work dealt with the case of translation-invariance, with applications to several problems of applied mathematics, including the Choquard equation. He was also able to extend parts of his work with Berestycki to settings without any rotational symmetry. By making use of Abbas Bahri&#x27;s topological methods and min-max theory, Bahri and Lions were able to establish multiplicity results for these problems. Lions also considered the problem of dilation invariance, with natural applications to optimizing functions for dilation-invariant functional inequalities such as the Sobolev inequality. He was able to apply his methods to give a new perspective on previous works on geometric problems such as the Yamabe problem and harmonic maps. With Thierry Cazenave, Lions applied his concentration-compactness results to establish orbital stability of certain symmetric solutions of nonlinear Schrödinger equations which admit variational interpretations and energy-conserving solutions.

===Transport and Boltzmann equations===
In 1988, François Golse, Lions, Benoît Perthame, and Rémi Sentis studied the transport equation, which is a first-order linear partial differential equation. They showed that if the first-order coefficients are randomly chosen according to some probability distribution, then the corresponding function values are distributed with regularity which is enhanced from the original probability distribution. These results were later extended by DiPerna, Lions, and Meyer. In the physical sense, such results, known as &quot;velocity-averaging lemmas&quot;, correspond to the fact that macroscopic observables have greater smoothness than their microscopic rules directly indicate. According to Cédric Villani, it is unknown if it is possible to instead use the explicit representation of solutions of the transport equation to derive these properties.

The classical Picard–Lindelöf theorem deals with integral curves of Lipschitz-continuous vector fields. By viewing integral curves as characteristic curves for a transport equation in multiple dimensions, Lions and Ronald DiPerna initiated the broader study of integral curves of Sobolev vector fields. DiPerna and Lions&#x27; results on the transport equation were later extended by Luigi Ambrosio to the setting of bounded variation, and by Alessio Figalli to the context of stochastic processes.

DiPerna and Lions were able to prove the global existence of solutions to the Boltzmann equation. Later, by applying the methods of Fourier integral operators, Lions established estimates for the Boltzmann collision operator, thereby finding compactness results for solutions of the Boltzmann equation. As a particular application of his compactness theory, he was able to show that solutions subsequentially converge at infinite time to Maxwell distributions. DiPerna and Lions also established a similar result for the Maxwell−Vlasov equations.

===Viscosity solutions===
Michael Crandall and Lions introduced the notion of viscosity solution, which is a kind of generalized solution of Hamilton–Jacobi equations. Their definition is significant since they were able to establish a well-posedness theory in such a generalized context. The basic theory of viscosity solutions was further worked out in collaboration with Lawrence Evans. Using a min-max quantity, Lions and Jean-Michel Lasry considered mollification of functions on Hilbert space which preserve analytic phenomena. Their approximations are naturally applicable to Hamilton-Jacobi equations, by regularizing sub- or super-solutions. Using such techniques, Crandall and Lions extended their analysis of Hamilton-Jacobi equations to the infinite-dimensional case, proving a comparison principle and a corresponding uniqueness theorem.

Crandall and Lions investigated the numerical analysis of their viscosity solutions, proving convergence results both for a finite difference scheme and artificial viscosity.

The comparison principle underlying Crandall and Lions&#x27; notion of viscosity solution makes their definition naturally applicable to second-order elliptic partial differential equations, given the maximum principle. Crandall, Ishii, and Lions&#x27; survey article on viscosity solutions for such equations has become a standard reference work.

===Mean field games===
With Jean-Michel Lasry, Lions has contributed to the development of mean-field game theory.

<doc id="1270076" wikidata="Q2453505" url="?curid=1270076" title="Third Partition of Poland">
<text>The Third Partition of Poland (1795) was the last in a series of the Partitions of Poland–Lithuania and the land of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth among Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy, and the Russian Empire which effectively ended Polish–Lithuanian national sovereignty until 1918. The partition was the result of the Kościuszko Uprising and was followed by a number of Polish–Lithuanian uprisings during the period.

==Background==

Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, in an attempt to strengthen the significantly weakened Commonwealth, King Stanisław August Poniatowski put into effect a series of reforms to enhance Poland&#x27;s military, political system, economy, and society. These reforms reached their climax with the enactment of the May Constitution in 1791, which established a constitutional monarchy with separation into three branches of government, strengthened the bourgeoisie and abolished many of the nobility&#x27;s privileges as well as many of the old laws of serfdom. In addition, to strengthen Poland&#x27;s international standings, King Stanislaus signed the Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790. Angered by what was seen as dangerous, Jacobin-style reforms, Russia invaded Poland in 1792, beginning the War in Defense of the Constitution. Abandoned by her Prussian allies and betrayed by Polish nobles who desired to restore the privileges they had lost under the May Constitution, Poland was forced to sign the Second Partition in 1793, which ceded Dobrzyn, Kujavia, and a large portion of Greater Poland to Prussia and all of Poland&#x27;s eastern provinces from Moldavia to Livonia to Russia, reducing Poland to one-third of her original size before the First Partition.

Outraged with the further humiliation of Poland by her neighbors and the betrayal by the Polish nobility, and emboldened by the French Revolution unfolding in France, the Polish masses quickly turned against the occupying forces of Prussia and Russia. Following a series of nationwide riots, on 24 March 1794, Polish patriot Tadeusz Kościuszko took command of the Polish armed forces and declared a nationwide uprising against Poland&#x27;s foreign occupiers, marking the beginning of the Kościuszko Uprising. Catherine II and Frederick William II were quick to respond and, despite initial successes by Kosciuszko&#x27;s forces, the uprising was crushed by November 1794. According to legend, when Kosciuszko fell off of his horse at the Battle of Maciejowice, shortly before he was captured, he said &quot;Finis Poloniae&quot;, meaning in Latin &quot;[This is] the end of Poland.&quot;

==Terms==
Austrian, Prussian, and Russian representatives met on 24 October 1795 to dissolve the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with the three conquering powers signing a treaty to divide the region on 26 January 1797. This gave the Habsburg monarchy control of the Western Galicia and Southern Mazovia territories, with approximately 1.2 million people; Prussia received Podlachia, the remainder of Masovia, and Warsaw, with 1 million people; and Russia received the remaining land, including Vilnius and 1.2 million people. Unlike previous partitions, no Polish representative was party to the treaty. The Habsburgs, Russia, and Prussia forced King Stanislaus to abdicate and retire to St. Petersburg, where he died as a trophy prisoner in 1798. The victors also agreed to erase the country&#x27;s name:

==Aftermath==

The Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ended the existence of an independent Polish and Lithuanian state for the next 123 years. Immediately following the Third Partition, the occupying powers forced many Polish politicians, intellectuals, and revolutionaries to emigrate across Europe, in what was later known as the Great Emigration. These Polish nationalists participated in uprisings against Austria, Prussia, and Russia in former Polish lands, and many would serve France as part of the Polish Legions. In addition, Polish poets and artists would make the desire for national freedom a defining characteristic of the Polish Romanticist movement. Poland briefly regained semi-autonomy in 1807 when Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw, but this effectively ended with the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Congress created the Kingdom of Poland, sometimes called Congress Poland, as a Russian puppet state. Even this, however, came to an end after a Polish insurrection in 1831, at which point Russia ended most of the kingdom&#x27;s autonomy and exacted multiple punitive measures on the Polish populace. In 1867, Russia made Poland an official part of the Russian Empire, as opposed to a puppet state. Poland would not regain full independence until the end of World War I when the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire allowed for the resurrection of Polish national sovereignty.

<doc id="1270077" wikidata="Q117591" url="?curid=1270077" title="Lamego">
<text>Lamego (; ) is a city and municipality in the Viseu District, in the Norte Region of the Douro in northern Portugal. Located on the shores of the Balsemão River, the municipality has a population of 26,691, in an area of 165.42 km2.

With origins before the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, Lamego is known for its historic city center, having a long history as a principal city of the former Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. Legend holds that the first Portuguese Cortes were held in Lamego, in 1143. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego is based in the city center.

==Etymology==
The toponymic name &quot;Lamego&quot; was derived from &quot;Lamaecus&quot;, a Hispano-Celtic and Roman derivative referring to owners of agrarian titles in the 3rd century around the local castle.

==History==

The area around Lamego was inhabited by Ligures and Turduli, and during the Roman presence it was occupied by Coelerni, which left behind several monuments. Due to the placement of the castle, it is likely that a castro originally existed on the site. During the &quot;Inquirições&quot; (&quot;Inventory/Enquiries&quot;) of King Afonso (during the 13th century) there was reference to the Castro de Lameco, referred to as a medieval fortification. Destroyed by the Romans, the inhabitants were forced to descend into the valley and cultivate the land, as part of the Roman reorganization of the land.

===Middle Ages===
Lamego became Catholic when the Visigothic king Rekared I converted to Catholicism. In 569, during the Council of Lugo, there appeared references to Sardinário the Bishop of Lamego. During the reign of Sisebuto (612-621), the Visigothic monarch coined currency from Lamego, indicating the importance of the region to commerce and culture.

Just outside the city center is the tiny 7th century São Pedro de Balsemão Chapel, a Visigothic chapel believed to be the oldest in Portugal (and second oldest in Europe).

The region alternated between Christian and Muslim hands during the early Reconquista Period. The city was first conquered by Alfonso I of Asturias in 741, and repopulated in 868 by Alfonso III. It fell into Islamic hands briefly again during the late 10th century, until Ferdinand I of León and Castile conquered the region definitively on 29 November 1057. As a consequence the bishopric was moved after these events (to later be restored in 1071).

In 1128, the nascent national Egas Moniz, had his tenancy in Lamego while his residence was in Britiande, as master of the Riba–Douro, between Paiva and Távora (in addition to the lands of Côa).
The most significant moment in the town&#x27;s history was in 1139, when nobles declared Afonso Henriques to be Portugal&#x27;s first king. The town&#x27;s Gothic cathedral was built by him, although only the Romanesque tower is left from the original building, with its carved Renaissance portal and fine cloister dating from the 16th and 18th centuries. The 12th-century castle preserves a fine keep and a very old and unusual cistern with monograms of master masons.

King Sancho I issued a charter of independence in 1191, as the local community grew around two poles: the ecclesiastical parishes of Sé and Castelo. In 1290, King Denis provided a market charter to the city, attracting merchants from Castile and Granada with their oriental spices and textiles.

Lamego had a privileged positioned on the routes from western Iberia, as a transit point within the settlements of the Além-Douro, Braga and Guimarães, from Alcântara and Mérida to Córdoba and Seville. It was also one of the preferred routes on the &quot;Saint James Way&quot; pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. But, two events changed the economic and social circumstances in the region: the conquest of Granada which drove the last of the Moors from the Peninsula; and the discovery of the maritime connection to India, which resulted in a slow decline for the region.

===Early modern era===

Manuel I of Portugal issued a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) in 1514. Also in the 16th century, Manuel de Noronha (one of the more notable prelates of Lamego) was appointed the Bishop of Lamego, occupying the role for the next 18 years and referred to the &quot;great builder&quot;, responsible for the cult of &quot;Nossa Senhora dos Remédios&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Remedies&quot;).

In the 17th and 18th century, the &quot;solares&quot; (&quot;country estates&quot;) were slowly constructed in Lamego, resulting from the wine commerce down the Douro.

The economic growth of viticulture along the Douro resulted in the issuance of a writ by Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, to designate the area as the &quot;Região Demarcada do Douro&quot; and the establishment of the &quot;Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro&quot; (&quot;General Company of the Wine Agriculture of the Upper Douro&quot;).

In 1835, Lamego was the capital of the district, but lost this title to Viseu (December 1835), under the authority of the King&#x27;s Minister Luís Mouzinho de Albuquerque. 
In 1919, in an attempt to restore the monarchy, Lamego became the capital of the district for 24 days.

During the second half of the 19th century, during the presidency of the Viscount of Guedes Teixeira, Lamego begins a process of modernization with the construction of new avenues.

After the establishment of the First Republic, during the presidency of Alfredo de Sousa, Lamego undergoes a new phase of building, including the construction a bridge over the Coura River.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Lamego has a Mediterranean climate with some continental influence; with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The nearest weather station is located in Bigorne, almost higher in altitude, and having cooler temperatures as such. While snowfalls in the city may happen usually no more than once or twice per year, the surrounding mountains often experience significantly more.

===Human geography===

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 18 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

* Lamego (Almacave e Sé)
* Avões
* Bigorne, Magueija e Pretarouca
* Britiande
* Cambres
* Cepões, Meijinhos e Melcões
* Ferreirim
* Ferreiros de Avões
* Figueira
* Lalim
* Lazarim
* Parada do Bispo e Valdigem
* Penajóia
* Penude
* Samodães
* Sande
* Várzea de Abrunhais
* Vila Nova de Souto d&#x27;El-Rei
==Economy==

The principal activities in this region are tied to the service sector, with commerce and agriculture also representing an important part of the economy. In particular viticulture, since the municipality (and other municipalities in the region) have been designated as part of the &quot;Denominação de Origem Controlada&quot; (DOC), a control used to classify wine products as a locally produced product of origin, for national and international marketing.

Lamego has a large shopping centre, with approximately 30 main shops, three malls of medium-size and several small traditional shops. Industrial activities are concentrated in the industrial zone in the parish of Várzea de Abrunhais. Lamego textiles are also promoted but tend to be small-scale production runs, with few medium- to large-companies involved in mass-production.

The tourist sector is primarily associated with the monuments and religious buildings, and has been a growing part of the local economy. The extension of the A24 motorway has been important in attracting more visitors and businesses to the region.

<doc id="1270080" wikidata="Q2911369" url="?curid=1270080" title="Assault (tort)">
<text>In common law, assault is the tort of acting intentionally, that is with either general or specific intent, causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact. Assault requires intent, it is considered an intentional tort, as opposed to a tort of negligence. Actual ability to carry out the apprehended contact is not necessary. &#x27;The conduct forbidden by this tort is an act that threatens violence.&#x27;

In criminal law an assault is defined as an attempt to commit battery, requiring the specific intent to cause physical injury.

== Comparison to battery ==
As distinguished from battery, assault does not need to involve the &#x27;unwanted physical contact; but is the anticipation of such contact&#x27;. It only needs intent to make or threaten contact and the resulting apprehension. At one point, the common law understanding of assault required more than words alone, it also required an overt act. This understanding has changed, while words alone cannot be construed as assault, words coinciding with actions or circumstances that would put a person in reasonable apprehension that a harm or offensive contact was likely to occur would. For example, an actor shouting &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you&quot; while not moving but in complete shadow and with a knife in their hand could be interpreted as assault. 

Additionally, fear is not required for an assault to occur, only anticipation of subsequent battery. A battery can occur without a preceding assault, such as if a person is struck in the back of the head. An assault can be an attempted battery.

I.e. &#x27;If Henry points a gun at Thomas he has committed an assault. It makes no difference whether the gun is loaded,&#x27; But &#x27;Henry will only commit a battery if he shoots the gun and hits Thomas&#x27;.

==Elements==
Defined by &quot;Collins v Wilcock&quot; as &#x27;an act which causes another person to apprehend the infliction of immediate unlawful force on his person&#x27;, &#x27;assault protects the claimant who fears or apprehends a battery.&#x27; Three elements must be established in order to establish tortious assault: first, there must be a positive act by the defendant; second, the plaintiff had reasonable apprehension (the requisite state of mind) of immediate physical contact, and third, the defendant&#x27;s act of interference was intentional (the defendant intended the resulting apprehension). 

An actionable assault requires that: 

*&#x27;the defendant intends that the claimant apprehends the application of unlawful force;
* the claimant reasonably apprehends the immediate and direct application of unlawful force;
* for which the defendant has no lawful justification or excuse.&#x27;

But intent for purposes of civil assault can be either general or specific. Specific intent means that when the defendant acted, he or she intended to cause apprehension of a harmful or unwanted contact. General intent means that the defendant knew with substantial certainty that the action would put someone in apprehension of a harmful or unwanted contact.

* While the law varies by jurisdiction, contact is often defined as &quot;harmful&quot; if it objectively intends to injure, disfigure, impair, or cause pain.
* The act is deemed &quot;offensive&quot; if it would offend a reasonable person&#x27;s sense of personal dignity.
* While &quot;imminence&quot; is judged objectively and varies widely on the facts, it generally suggests there is little to no opportunity for intervening acts.
* Lastly, the state of &quot;apprehension&quot; should be differentiated from the general state of fear, as apprehension requires only that the person be aware of the imminence of the harmful or offensive act.

It is clear that &#x27;all forms of trespass require an intentional act. An act of negligence will not suffice.&#x27; There must be capacity and immediacy - simply threatening someone will not suffice.

Whilst it has been speculated that words alone do not constitute assault, there must be an act (I.e. in &quot;R v Meade&quot;), this was questioned in &quot;R v Ireland&quot; it was held that repeated silent telephone calls being made can constitute an assault:

&quot;&#x27;The proposition that a gesture may amount to an assault, but that words can never suffice, is unrealistic and indefensible.&quot;&#x27; - Lord Steyn

Moreover, In Australia, the test for proving tortious assault is formulated as requiring &quot; &#x27;proof of an intention to create in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact&#x27; &quot;.

== Different types of assault ==

=== Conditional assault ===
This is whereby someone puts a condition on their assault. In the case of &quot;Read v Coker,&quot; where the claimant was threatened by a group of people who said: &#x27;if you don&#x27;t leave we will break your neck.&#x27; The court held the defendants were liable for tortious assault. Moreover, Jervis CJ stated: &#x27;If anything short of actual striking will in law constitute an assault, the facts here clearly showed that D was guilty of an assault.&#x27;

=== Words negating an assault to a certain extent ===
Whilst it was held in &quot;Tuberville v Savage&quot;, where the plaintiff said &#x27;If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you,&#x27; whilst showing his sword, that words negating an assault is not an assault. This was because &#x27;the &quot;intention&quot; as well as &quot;the act&quot; makes an assault&#x27; and &#x27;the court agreed it was not; for the declaration of the plaintiff was, that he would not assault him,&#x27;. 

However, words negating an assault to a certain extent is an assault. &quot;If one, intending to assault: so if he held up his hand against another in a threatening manner and say nothing, it is an assault.-&#x27;. For example, If person A held a knife to right up to person B&#x27;s throat and said: &quot;because there are people around I won&#x27;t cut you&quot;, this would be enough to warrant an assault. This was clarified in &quot;R v Light&quot; where the defendant held a spade over his wife&#x27;s head and said &#x27;if that police officer wasn&#x27;t outside, I would hurt you&#x27;. This was held to warrant an assault, words can only negate an assault to a certain extent. If there is a weapon in hand then the words you say are unlikely to negate your assault. &#x27;There is an obvious proximity in time and place.&#x27; and a viable threat of real, imminent harm. 

==Defences==
Assault can be justified in situations where there is &#x27;lawful justification or excuse&#x27; for their actions such as: self-defense or defense of a third party where the act was deemed reasonable and necessary. It can also be justified in the context of a sport where consent may be given or implied. An act of assault may also be privileged, meaning that the person who commits the assault had the legal right to do so and cannot be sued, as might occur if a police officer draws a firearm on a criminal suspect. Lastly, automatism (e.g., sleep walking) acts to negate the intent element as someone acting while asleep is not acting voluntarily.

== Damages ==
The claimant could be awarded nominal damage, if no harm came to them because this tort is actionable per se. Additionally, they could be entitled to: compensatory damages whereby you try and put the claimant in the position they would have been in before the assault occurred, or the claimant could be entitled to an injunction whereby you try and stop repeated behaviour occurring by setting conditions and finally, aggravated damages may be awarded which are awarded if the tort is found to be an affront to someone&#x27;s dignity.

<text>Colonization of the Congo Basin refers to the European colonization of the Congo Basin of tropical Africa. It was the last part of the continent to be colonized. By the end of the 19th century, the Basin had been carved up by European colonial powers, into the Congo Free State, the French Congo and the Portuguese Congo (modern Cabinda Province of Angola).

==Early European exploration==

One by one the other great mysteries had been explored:
* The coasts by Prince Henry the Navigator&#x27;s Portuguese sailors in the 15th century.
* The Blue Nile by James Bruce in 1773.
* The remote upper Niger by Mungo Park in 1796.
* The vast Sahara by competitors Laing, Caillié, and Clapperton in the 1820s.
* The fever-ridden mangroves of the lower Niger by the brothers Richard and John Lander in 1830.
* Southern Africa and the Zambezi by Livingstone and John Clafton in the 1850s.
* The upper Nile by Burton, Speke, and Baker in a succession of expeditions between 1857 and 1868.

Though the Congo had been one of the first to be attempted, it remained a mystery.

Since the 15th century, European explorers had sailed into the broad Congo estuary, planning to fight their way up the falls and rapids that begin only inland, and then travel up the river to its unknown source. All failed. The rapids and falls, had they known it, extended for inland, and the terrain close by the river was impassable, and remains so to this day.

Repeated attempts to travel overland were repulsed with heavy casualties, accidents, conflicts with natives, and, above all, disease saw large and well-equipped expeditions got no further than or so past the westernmost rapid, the legendary Cauldron of Hell.

==Stanley&#x27;s exploration==

It was not until 1877 that the Congo was explored by Europeans, and even then it was not from the sea, but from the other side of the African continent. Setting out from Zanzibar, Henry Morton Stanley, a British-born American journalist and explorer aimed to find the famous Dr. Livingstone. Livingstone had not been heard from in several years and was, in fact, exploring the upper reaches of a great navigable inland river called the Lualaba, which Livingstone hoped was connected to the Nile, but which turned out to be the upper Congo.

After leaving Livingstone, Stanley sailed for 1,000 miles (1,600 km) down the Lualaba (Upper Congo) to the large lake he named Stanley Pool (now called Pool Malebo). Then, rather than perish in the impenetrable country of the cascades, Stanley took a wide detour overland to come within striking distance of the European trading station at Boma on the Congo estuary.

==Prelude to conquest==
===Henry Morton Stanley===

When Stanley returned to Europe in 1878, he had not only found Dr. Livingstone (an event remembered to this day), resolved the last great mystery of African exploration, and ruined his health: he had also opened the heart of tropical Africa up to the outside world. This was to be his most enduring legacy.

Stanley was lionised across Europe. He wrote articles, appeared at public meetings, lobbied the rich and powerful tirelessly; and always his theme was the boundless opportunity for commercial exploitation of the lands he had discovered or, in his own words, to &quot;pour the civilisation of Europe into the barbarism of Africa&quot;.

&quot;There are 40,000,000 naked people&quot; on the other side of the rapids, Stanley wrote, &quot;and the cotton-spinners of Manchester are waiting to clothe them... Birmingham&#x27;s factories are glowing with the red metal that shall presently be made into ironwork in every fashion and shape for them... and the ministers of Christ are zealous to bring them, the poor benighted heathen, into the Christian fold.&quot;

Europe was less than keen on the idea: the great European scramble for Africa had not yet begun. Outside of the Cape of Good Hope and the Mediterranean coast, Europe had no African colonies of any significance. The focus of the great powers was still firmly on the lands that had made Europe&#x27;s fortune: the Americas, the East Indies, India, China, and Australasia. There seemed no economic sense to investing energy in Africa when the returns from other colonies were likely to be both richer and more immediate. Nor was there a strong humanitarian interest in the continent now that the American slave trade had been extinguished. Stanley was applauded, admired, decorated—and ignored.

=== King Leopold II of Belgium ===

It is at this point that Leopold II of Belgium took a part. In Peter Forbath&#x27;s words, Leopold was:A tall, imposing man ... enjoying a reputation for hedonistic sensuality, cunning intelligence (his father once described him as subtle and sly as a fox), overweening ambition, and personal ruthlessness. He was, nevertheless, an extremely minor monarch in the &quot;realpolitik&quot; of the times, ruling a totally insignificant nation, a nation in fact that had come into existence barely four decades before and lived under the constant threat of losing its precarious independence to the great European powers around it. He was a figure who, one might have had every reason to expect, would devote himself to maintaining his country&#x27;s strict neutrality, avoiding giving offence to any of his powerful neighbours, and indulging his keenly developed tastes for the pleasures of the flesh, rather than one who would make a profound impact on history. Yet, in the most astonishing and improbable way imaginable, he managed virtually single-handedly to upset the balance of power in Africa and usher in the terrible age of European colonialism on the black continent.As a constitutional monarch, Leopold was charged with the usual constitutional duties of opening parliaments, greeting diplomats, and attending state funerals. He had no power to decide policy. But for over 20 years he had been agitating for Belgium to take its place among the great colonial powers of Europe. Leopold noted, &quot;Our frontiers can never be extended into Europe.&quot; However, he added, &quot;since history teaches that colonies are useful, that they play a great part in that which makes up the power and prosperity of states, let us strive to get one in our turn.&quot;

At various times, he launched unsuccessful schemes to buy an Argentine province, to buy Borneo from the Dutch, rent the Philippines from Spain, or establish colonies in China, Vietnam, Japan, or the Pacific islands. When the 1860s explorers focused attention on Africa, Leopold schemed to colonise Mozambique on the east coast, Senegal on the west coast, and the Congo in the centre. None of these schemes came anywhere near fruition: the government of Belgium resolutely resisted all Leopold&#x27;s suggestions, seeing the acquisition of a colony as a good way to spend large amounts of money for little or no return.

Leopold&#x27;s eventual response was extraordinary in its hubris and simplicity. If the government of Belgium would not take a colony, then he would simply do it himself, acting in his private capacity as an ordinary citizen.

===Brussels Geographic Conference===
In 1876, Leopold II sponsored an international geographical conference in Brussels, inviting delegates from scientific societies all over Europe to discuss philanthropic and scientific matters such as the best way to coordinate map making, to prevent the re-emergence of the west coast slave trade, and to investigate ways of sending medical aid to Africa. The conference was a sham: at its close, Leopold proposed that they set up an international benevolent committee to carry on, and modestly agreed to accept the chairman&#x27;s role. He created a baffling series of subsidiary shell organisations, culminating in the cunningly named International African Association (), which had a single shareholder: Leopold himself. For the look of things, he held one more meeting the following year, but from that time on, the International African Association was simply a front for Leopold&#x27;s ambition.

===Stanley as Leopold&#x27;s agent===
Soon after Stanley returned from the Congo, Leopold tried to recruit him. Stanley, still hopeful for British backing, brushed him off. However, Leopold persisted and eventually Stanley gave in. Leopold II, it seemed, was the only European willing to finance Stanley&#x27;s dream: the building of a railway over the Crystal Mountains from the sea to Stanley Pool, from which river steamers could reach 1,000 miles (1,600 km) into the heart of Africa.

Stanley, much more familiar with the rigours of the African climate and the complexities of local politics than Leopold — Leopold II never set foot in the Congo — persuaded his patron that the first step should be the construction of a wagon trail and a series of forts. Leopold agreed and in deepest secrecy, Stanley signed a five-year contract at a salary of £1,000 a year, and set off to Zanzibar under an assumed name. To avoid discovery, materials and workers were shipped in by various roundabout routes, and communications between Stanley and Leopold were entrusted to Colonel Maximilien Strauch.

It was only at this point that Stanley was informed of the magnitude of Leopold&#x27;s ambition: Stanley was not merely to construct a series of trading stations, he was to secretly carve out an entire nation. The instructions were direct and to the point: &quot;It is a question of creating a new State, as big as possible, and of running it. It is clearly understood that in this project there is no question of granting the slightest political power to the negros. That would be absurd.&quot;

Apparently finding nothing reprehensible about Leopold&#x27;s ambitions, Stanley set about his task with a will. For all his social shortcomings in European society, he was undoubtedly the right man for the job. Within three years, his capacity for hard work, his skill at playing one social group off against another, his ruthless use of modern weaponry to kill opponents, and above all his relentless determination opened the route to the Upper Congo.

In later years, Stanley would write that the most vexing part of his duties was not the work itself, nor negotiating with the natives, but keeping order amongst the ill-assorted collection of white men he had brought with him as overseers, who squabbled constantly over small matters of rank or status. &quot;Almost all of them&quot;, he wrote, &quot;clamoured for expenses of all kinds, which included ... wine, tobacco, cigars, clothes, shoes, board and lodging, and certain nameless extravagances&quot; (by which he meant attractive slaves to warm their beds).

Exhausted, Stanley returned to Europe, only to be sent straight back by Leopold, who promised him an outstanding assistant: Charles &#x27;Chinese&#x27; Gordon (who did not in fact take up Leopold&#x27;s offer but chose instead to go to meet his fate at Khartoum). &quot;It is indispensable&quot;, instructed Leopold, &quot;that you should purchase for the &quot;&quot; (i.e., Leopold himself) as much land as you can obtain&quot;.

Having established a beachhead on the lower Congo, in 1883 Stanley set out upriver to extend Leopold&#x27;s domain, employing his usual methods: negotiations with local chiefs buying sovereignty in exchange for bolts of cloth and trinkets; playing one tribe off another; and if need be, simply shooting an obstructive chief and negotiating with his cowed successor instead. However, as he approached Stanley Falls at the junction between the Congo proper and the Lualaba (close to the general vicinity of Central Africa where he had found Livingstone six years before), it soon became clear that Stanley&#x27;s men were not the only intruders.

===Dealings with Zanzibari slave traders===
Tippu Tip, the most powerful of the Zanzibari slave traders of the 19th century, was well known to Stanley, as was the social chaos and devastation that slave-hunting brought. It had only been through Tippu Tip&#x27;s help that Stanley had found Livingstone (who himself had survived years on the Lualaba by virtue of Tippu Tip&#x27;s friendship). Now, Stanley discovered, Tippu Tip&#x27;s men had reached still further west in search of fresh populations to enslave.

Four years before, the Zanzibaris had thought the Congo deadly and impassable, and warned Stanley not to attempt to go there, but when Tippu Tip learned in Zanzibar that Stanley had survived, he was quick to act. Villages throughout the region had been burned and depopulated. Tippu Tip had raided 118 villages, killed 4,000 Africans, and, when Stanley reached his camp, had 2,300 slaves, mostly young women and children, in chains ready to transport halfway across the continent to the markets of Zanzibar.

Having found the new ruler of the upper Congo, Stanley negotiated an agreement with Tippu Tip to allow him to build his final river station just below Stanley Falls (which prevented vessels sailing further upstream). At the end of his physical resources, Stanley returned home, to be replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Francis de Winton, formerly a British Army officer.

<text>The Pact of Vilnius and Radom (, ) was a set of three acts passed in Vilnius, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and confirmed by the Crown Council in Radom, Kingdom of Poland in 1401. The union amended the earlier act of the Union of Krewo (1385) and confirmed the Ostrów Agreement (1392). Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, became fully in charge of the Lithuanian affairs, while Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland, reserved the rights of an overlord. After the death of Vytautas, Lithuania was to be ruled by Władysław II Jagiełło or his legal heir. The union is generally seen as strengthening of the Polish–Lithuanian union.

==Background==
Both Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland, and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, sought to renew the Polish–Lithuanian union, which had existed since 1385. In 1399, King Jadwiga of Poland died due to childbirth complications, leaving Władysław II Jagiełło king of a foreign land and without an heir. If Polish nobles forced Władysław II Jagiełło to abdicate the throne, he would return to Lithuania demanding the throne of the Grand Duke. Vytautas would be forced either to return to Duchy of Trakai or launch another civil war. The same year Vytautas suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Vorskla River against the Golden Horde and faced rebellions in the Principality of Smolensk, Republic of Pskov, and Velikiy Novgorod.

==Provisions==
Negotiations began in late December 1400 in Hrodna. The union was signed in three separate acts: one by Władysław II Jagiełło (the original of which did not survive), another by Vytautas and the Lithuanian nobles (in Vilnius on 18 January 1401), and the third by the Polish Royal Council (in Radom on 11 March 1401). It is significant that for the first time the Lithuanian nobles issued a political act in their own name, not merely as witnesses to the Grand Duke&#x27;s treaties.

Vytautas was instituted as the Grand Duke of Lithuania (&quot;magnus dux&quot;) while his cousin Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland, retained the rights of an overlord (&quot;supremus dux&quot;). The union legalized Vytautas status as an actual ruler of Lithuania and his right to use title of &quot;grand duke&quot; (what he was doing before but not in correspondence with Poland) However, this independence was to be temporary – after Vytautas&#x27; death Lithuania was to be governed by Władysław II Jagiełło or his legal heir and will become part of the kingdom and crown of Poland. The Polish and Lithuanian nobles agreed not to elect a new King of Poland without consulting each other. At the time neither Władysław II Jagiełło nor Vytautas had heirs, but each hoped to sire legitimate sons that would inherit both the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy (eventually it would be Jogaila who would succeed in this). Vytautas also renewed his vows to Jagiełło, to the crown, kingdom, and inhabitants of Poland and promised to aid them when necessary.

==Aftermath and evaluations==
The renewed alliance stabilized the situation, allowing Vytautas to launch an offensive against the Teutonic Knights and to initiate the first Samogitian uprising. Eventually, the joint Polish–Lithuanian forces achieved a decisive victory against the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. The treaty has been variously interpreted by Lithuanian and Polish historians. Some argued that it was a diplomatic failure on Vytautas&#x27; part, as the union blocked the path to his possible coronation as King of Lithuania. Others saw it as a concession by the Poles when their plan to fully incorporate the Grand Duchy into the Kingdom of Poland failed. A third school of thought considered the union to be a mutual compromise: Lithuania abandoned plans for full independence, while Poland abandoned plans for full incorporation of Lithuania into a unitary state. Some more recent academic works tend not to overestimate the union&#x27;s importance and see it as mere codification of the actual Polish–Lithuanian relations that had existed since 1392. Other researchers emphasize the fact that Lithuanians were included into election of new Polish monarch. With the death of Jadwiga Poland lost last ruler with a hereditary right to rule, Polish nobles reserved for themselves right to elect new king upon his death, even the rights of his possible son with newly married Anne of Cejle, granddaughter of Kazimierz III, were not guaranteed. Inclusion of Lithuanian nobles into future election can be seen as inclusion of them into &quot;community of the realm&quot; (&quot;communitas regni&quot;) embodied in Poland by the notion of &quot;the crown of the kingdom of Poland&quot; (&quot;corona regni Poloniae&quot;).

<text>The Kills are an English-American rock duo formed by American singer Alison &quot;VV&quot; Mosshart and English guitarist Jamie &quot;Hotel&quot; Hince. They are signed to Domino Records. Their first four albums, &quot;Keep On Your Mean Side&quot;, &quot;No Wow&quot;, &quot;Midnight Boom&quot;, and &quot;Blood Pressures&quot;, all reached the UK Albums Chart. Their fifth studio album, &quot;Ash &amp; Ice&quot;, was released in 2016 and reached the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart.

==Career==

=== Discount ===
Mosshart and Hince both played in other bands before they formed The Kills in 2001. Mosshart was previously the vocalist of punk rock band Discount, while Hince featured in rock bands such as Scarfo and Blyth Power. Mosshart encountered Hince when her band was touring England, where Hince was &quot;staying in the flat upstairs from where [she] was staying&quot; in London. Mosshart insisted on forming a band with Hince and &quot;really persisted, and eventually we started writing and he encouraged me&quot;. Hince supplied her with a four-track tape recorder and insisted she write music as well as lyrics while on tour with her band. The two continued to exchange music ideas by sending each other tapes.

Discount disbanded in 2000, and Mosshart moved to London in the same year. Before settling on a name, Mosshart and Hince performed as &quot;VV&quot; and &quot;Hotel&quot; respectively, Hince explaining that they &quot;named each other off the top of our heads as a stupid romantic ode to the pop art scene&quot;. The duo opted for The Kills as it &quot;sounded like a band that could exist in any decade&quot;.

=== Signing to Domino ===
Using the ideas on the tapes, Mosshart and Hince began to write minimalist songs with the aid of a drum machine. In 2001 they showcased their new songs on a demo tape while shunning approaches from major record labels. Recording as VV and Hotel, they contributed the song &quot;Restaurant Blouse&quot; to the compilation &quot;If the Twenty-First Century Did Not Exist, It Would Be Necessary to Invent It&quot;. Shortly after that they recorded their debut release, the &quot;Black Rooster EP&quot;, which saw release on British indie label Domino Records and was picked up for distribution by Dim Mak Records in the United States.

After touring internationally, they went to Toe Rag Studios where The White Stripes had recorded their album &quot;Elephant&quot;, to record their debut album &quot;Keep on Your Mean Side&quot;, mostly on 8-track, in just 2 weeks. Distributed in the U.S. and UK by Rough Trade Records, the album was similar in style to the EP, veering from the Velvets-esque stomp of &quot;Wait&quot; to the noisy, dirty garage punk blues of &quot;Fuck the People&quot; and dark psychedelia of &quot;Kissy Kissy&quot;. The record was well received by the music press, though the White Stripes comparisons would not go away.

Mosshart chain-smoked while singing, rarely speaking to the audience; at a New York City show following the ban on public smoking, Mosshart went on stage with three bottles of water, lit up a cigarette, and proceeded to smoke constantly from the first song to the last note of the set. In 2004 Mosshart and Hince bought a house together in Dalston, East London. In 2005, &quot;Monkey 23&quot; was used in the film &quot;De battre mon cœur s&#x27;est arrêté&quot;, where it played over the closing credits. It was also featured in season three of &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Wait&quot; was used in &quot;Children of Men&quot;, where it was described in-universe as &quot;a blast from the past all the way back to 2003, that beautiful time when people refused to accept the future is just around the corner&quot;.

=== &quot;No Wow&quot; and &quot;Midnight Boom&quot; ===
Their second album, &quot;No Wow&quot;, was released by Domino Records on February 21, 2005. Featuring an artier, less &quot;guitar rock&quot; sound, the record embraced post punk influences and sounded even more stripped down than &quot;Keep on Your Mean Side&quot;. Originally written to be performed on a Moog, the band was forced to change directions and record it primarily using a guitar after Hince&#x27;s Moog broke and couldn&#x27;t be repaired before entering the studio. A 40-minute DVD documentary was included with a limited number of copies and features interview, performance and on the road footage shot on tour. The first single, &quot;The Good Ones&quot;, from &quot;No Wow&quot;, was released on February 7, 2005, and reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart, which is their highest-charting single in that chart to date.

&quot;Midnight Boom&quot; was released in March 2008. Its music was used throughout many American TV shows, including &quot;90210&quot;. A big selection of songs from the album were featured in the hit television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, and also, their track &quot;Sour Cherry&quot; was featured as the soundbed for Season Two&#x27;s official trailer. &quot;Sour Cherry&quot; was also featured in the &quot;Footloose&quot; trailer, as well as in the 2008 rom-com &quot;The House Bunny&quot;. The album also picked up new mainstream success for the band with various TV performances in the UK; appearing on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, &quot;T4&quot;, &quot;The Album Chart Show&quot;, &quot;Sound&quot;, &quot;Live From Abbey Road&quot;, and &quot;From The Basement&quot;.

On October 21, 2008, &quot;Cheap and Cheerful&quot; was used on the show &quot;House&quot; during the opening scene of the episode &quot;Lucky Thirteen&quot;. &quot;Cheap and Cheerful&quot; can also be heard on the &quot;NHL 09&quot; soundtrack. It was later used in the Fendi&#x27;s TV commercial for the &quot;Fan di Fendi&quot; perfume (2010). &quot;U.R.A. Fever&quot; was played during a love scene in the 2010 movie &quot;The Losers&quot;. Only the chorus of the song is played. &quot;U.R.A. Fever&quot; was heard in the 2010 film &quot;Welcome to the Rileys&quot;, as well as appearing on its soundtrack. It is also heard on the 2011 movie &quot;Catch .44&quot; (partially) and the 2012 movie Detention. The bonus song &quot;Night Train&quot; appeared in the 2009 remake of the film Friday The 13th and in the 2012 American drama film &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot;, along with &quot;Hook and Line&quot;. The song &quot;What New York Used to Be&quot; was used in the film &quot;Push&quot;.

=== &quot;Blood Pressures&quot; ===
On September 11, 2009, the duo announced on their MySpace page that they had begun work on their fourth studio album though no release date had been set. &quot;Black Balloon&quot; from their &quot;Black Balloon EP&quot;, released in 2009, was featured in the Season 2 episode of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;, &quot;Net Worth&quot;, on February 15, 2011. The Kills&#x27; fourth studio album, &quot;Blood Pressures&quot;, was released in April 2011. A video for the first single from &quot;Blood Pressures&quot;, &quot;Satellite&quot;, was released on February 9, 2011, followed By Future Starts Slow, Baby Says, The Last Goodbye, and Wild Charms in September 2012. &quot;Future Starts Slow&quot; was also used in a promotion for the episode &quot;The Wait Is Almost Over&quot; of hit TV series True Blood (season 4). The song from the same album &quot;Damned If She Do&quot; was also used in the promotion of &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; third season, and has received positive reviews from the fans. &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot; was used in the 2012 film &quot;Just Like A Woman&quot;, starring Sienna Miller.

&quot;Future Starts Slow&quot; appears in the trailer for the 2012 action thriller film &quot;Contraband&quot;, a March 2012 episode of the &quot;Vampire Diaries&quot;, in a promotion and, beginning with the second episode, was used as the theme music for the 2012 TV series &quot;Political Animals (miniseries)&quot;, was used towards the end of episode 16, season 2 of &quot;Person of Interest&quot; and featured in the season 1 finale of &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;. They contributed a cover of &quot;Dreams&quot; to the Fleetwood Mac tribute compilation &quot;Just Tell Me That You Want Me&quot;, set for release on August 14, 2012, through Hear Music and Concord Music Group.

In September the duo published the photo book &quot;Dream &amp; Drive&quot;, created together with photographer Kenneth Capello. It coincided with an exhibition at the Milk Gallery, London. &quot;Paris Spleen: The Kills Live at L&#x27;Olympia&quot;, the film of their show from November 2011 was released on 20 September 2013 in partnership with the French clothing company Equipment. The Kills were set to go on a small American tour with Queens of the Stone Age in December 2013. In the same year, Hince suffered an injury to his left hand when a car door closed on it. He lost the use of his middle finger and had to have a number of operations. As a result he adjusted his playing style and equipment.
Shortly after the announcement of the shows, the band&#x27;s record label, Domino Records confirmed that the duo were working on their next album. In May 2014, Mosshart said that they were looking for a new sound and that this new album will be completely different from the others. She noted that &quot;&quot;&quot;You never know what&#x27;s going to happen with a record when you&#x27;re writing. It could be done all of a sudden in two months, or it could take another year. You get on these tangents, and you find new directions. You kind of follow the scent wherever it&#x27;s taking you. Sometimes it takes a long time. Sometimes it&#x27;s fast as hell.&quot;

=== &quot;Ash &amp; Ice&quot;, hiatus and &quot;God Games&quot; ===
The Kills were part of the line-up for Coachella 2016. The Kills fifth studio album, &quot;Ash &amp; Ice&quot;, was released on 3 June 2016. A new single titled &quot;Doing It to Death&quot; was released in March 2016. The duo embarked on a lengthy world tour, but were forced to cancel European festival dates after Mosshart was diagnosed with pneumonia. In 2017 the group were the support act for Guns N&#x27; Roses during the UK leg of their world tour. In 2018, they released a 7-inch single with cover versions of Saul Williams&#x27; &quot;List of Demands (Reparations)&quot; and Peter Tosh&#x27;s &quot;Steppin&#x27; Razor&quot;, followed by a promotional 7-inch a year later for National Dive Bar Day with the B-sides &quot;Blue Moon&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot;. Mosshart also published her multimedia book &quot;Car Ma&quot; later that year. The band were largely inactive during 2019, only playing one show that October supporting Social Distortion. At the show, the band played &quot;Midnight Boom&quot; in its entirety.

In December 2020, the band released the rarities collection &quot;Little Bastards&quot;, which compiled B-sides and demos from between 2002 and 2009. The band had appeared virtually as a musical guest on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; the month prior to promote the album, playing &quot;Raise Me&quot; from their home studio. Mosshart also released a handful of solo singles that year: &quot;Rise&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Water&quot;, and a cover of &quot;State Trooper&quot; by Bruce Springsteen. &quot;Sound Wheel&quot;, a spoken-word album that served as a companion piece to &quot;Car Ma&quot;, was released on August 7, 2020 via Third Man Records. Hince, meanwhile, focused on collaborative songwriting; he worked on Deap Vally&#x27;s &quot;Digital Dream&quot; EP in February 2021, as well as The Big Pink&#x27;s single &quot;Love Spins On Its Axis&quot;, which he co-wrote with the band and Jamie T.

The band returned in June 2022, playing their first show in almost three years in support of Jack White at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. In July 2023, the band released their first new original music in seven years: A double A-side single, &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;LA Hex&quot;. Both songs served as the lead singles to band&#x27;s sixth album &quot;God Games&quot;, which was released on October 27, 2023. A further two singles were released from the album prior to its release: &quot;103&quot; in August, and &quot;Wasterpiece&quot; in October.

==Influences==
The band has cited Royal Trux, PJ Harvey, the Velvet Underground, Sleater-Kinney, Fugazi, The Clash, The Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Pixies, Bikini Kill, and Sonic Youth as influences.

<doc id="1270090" wikidata="Q4671162" url="?curid=1270090" title="Academic administration">
<text>Academic administration is a branch of university or college employees responsible for the maintenance and supervision of the institution and separate from the faculty or academics, although some personnel may have joint responsibilities. Some type of separate administrative structure exists at almost all academic institutions. Fewer institutions are governed by employees who are also involved in academic or scholarly work. Many senior administrators are academics who have advanced degrees and no longer teach or conduct research.

==Key responsibilities==
Key broad administrative responsibilities (and thus administrative units) in academic institutions include:
* Admissions
* Supervision of academic affairs such as hiring, promotion, tenure, and evaluation (with faculty input where appropriate);
* Maintenance of official records (typically supervised by a registrar);
* Maintenance and audit of financial flows and records;
* Maintenance and construction of campus buildings and grounds (the &quot;physical plant&quot;);
* Safety and security of people and property on the campus (often organized as an office of public safety or campus police);
* Supervision and support of campus computers and network (information technology).
* Fundraising from private individuals and foundations (&quot;development&quot; or &quot;advancement&quot;)
* Research administration (including grants and contract administration, and institutional compliance with federal and state regulations)
* Public affairs (including relations with the media, the community, and local, state, and federal governments)
* Student services such as disability services, career counselling and library staff.

==Administrative titles==
The chief executive, the administrative and educational head of a university, depending on tradition and location, may be termed the university president, the provost, the chancellor (the United States), the vice-chancellor (many Commonwealth countries), principal (Scotland and Canada), or rector (Europe, Russia, Asia, the Middle East and South America).

An administrative executive in charge of a university department or of some schools, may be termed a dean or some variation. The chief executive of academic establishments other than universities, may be termed headmaster or head teacher (schools), director (used to reflect various positions ranging from the head of an institution to the head of a program), or principal, as used in primary education.

==Administrative communication==
Like other professional areas, academic administration follows a specialized and often highly abstract terminology. This terminology often depends on that used in military strategy (as in Strategic Planning) and business management (including Public Relations).

Digital era brings a communication overload and intense stresses of the job are threatening administrators mental or physical health. Administrators are operating in an era of multiple continuing crises, unreliable supply chains etc. Prof. David D. Perlmutter dean of the College of Media &amp; Communication at Texas Tech University suggests several questions to ask about the regular meetings which administrators hold:

* Are these meetings necessary?
* Do they have to happen as often as they do?
* What is the best way to distribute information, especially in a governance culture, so people can be aware of it and act upon it without being overwhelmed?
* Do people understand the steps and goals of the process, or are they just participating out of tradition?
* Can the number of participants be reduced without hurting governance?
* Do we need to modify any of our processes because of the lack of face-to-face interactions that have occurred off and on since the pandemic began?

==By country==

Academic administrations are structured in various ways at different institutions and in different countries.

===Australia===
Full-time tertiary education administrators emerged as a distinct role in Australia from the mid-1970s, as institutions sought to deal with their increasing size and complexity, along with a broadening of their aspirations. As the professionalism of tertiary administrators has developed, there has been a corresponding push to recognise the uniqueness and validity of their role in the academic environment.

, general staff composed over half the employees at Australian universities. Around 65% of these are female. There has recently been a shift in the preferred nomenclature for non-academic staff at Australian universities, from &quot;general staff&quot; to &quot;professional staff&quot;. It has been argued that the changing in role of the professional staff has been due to the changing work that they are performing, as professional staff assist students with technology.

The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in Australia is the Association for Tertiary Education Management.

===United Kingdom===

====Administrative structures====

The structures for administration and management in higher education in the United Kingdom vary significantly between institutions. Any description of a general structure will therefore not apply to some or even many institutions, and therefore any general statement of structures may be misleading. Not all UK universities have the post of Registrar.

The Director of Finance may report to the Registrar or directly to the Vice-Chancellor, whilst other senior posts may or may not report to the Registrar. This next tier of senior positions might include Directors of Human Resources, Estates, and Corporate Affairs. The Academic Registrar is often included in this next tier. Their role is mostly to accomplish student-facing administrative processes such as admissions, student records, complaints, and graduation.

====Professional associations====

The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in the UK is the Association of University Administrators.

===United States===

====Presidents and chancellors====

In the United States, a college or university is typically supervised by a president or chancellor who reports regularly to a board of trustees (made up of individuals from outside the institution) and who acts as chief executive officer. Most large colleges and universities now use an administrative structure with a tier of vice presidents, among whom the provost (or vice president for academic affairs, or academic dean) as the chief academic officer. Although the demographic picture of university leadership is changing, the majority of academic administrators remain middle-aged white men.

=====Remuneration of presidents and chancellors=====
The ten highest-paid administrators at private colleges earn an average of about $2.5 million per year, while at public colleges the figure is $1.4 million. These figures includes both base pay and other income.

==== Deans ====

Deans may supervise various and more specific aspects of the institution, or may be CEOs of entire campuses. They may report directly to the president or chancellor. The division of responsibility among deans varies widely among institutions; some are chiefly responsible for clusters of academic fields (such as the humanities or natural sciences) or whole academic units (such as a graduate school or college), while others are responsible for non-academic but campus-wide concerns such as minority affairs. In some cases a provost supervises the institution&#x27;s entire academic staff, occupying a position generally superior to any dean. In other instances the Dean of a College may be the equivalent to a Provost or Vice Chancellor or Vice President for Academic Affairs. Below deans in the administrative hierarchy are heads of individual academic departments and of individual administrative departments. These heads (commonly styled &quot;chairs&quot; or &quot;directors&quot;) then supervise the faculty and staff of their individual departments.

==== Departmental Chairs ====

The Chair of a department is typically a tenured or at least tenure-track faculty member, supported by administrative staff.

Administrative expansion

The number of administrators on university campuses has grown dramatically in recent decades, one reason that the rise in college tuition costs has outstripped the rate of inflation.

<text>Under Dusken is the official student newspaper in Trondheim, Norway, with a circulation of 10,000 copies. 
Founded in 1914, it is Scandinavia&#x27;s oldest student newspaper, and the second largest student newspaper in Norway after Oslo&#x27;s &quot;Universitas&quot;.

About 60 students work pro bono to produce a new edition of &quot;Under Dusken&quot; every second week.

The newspaper is jointly owned by Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem and Studentsamskipnaden i Trondheim through the media holding company Mediastud, which also is the publisher of &quot;Studentradioen i Trondheim&quot; (Norway&#x27;s first student radio) and &quot;Student-TV&quot; (Scandinavia&#x27;s oldest student television station).

The editor in chief is elected annually by the board of Mediastud. However, continuity has been ensured by electing candidates nominated by the editorial board of the newspaper.

== Software development ==
Under Dusken has since the mid 90s developed many of their own utilities. The computer department in Under Dusken has developed two content management systems, Aranea and Pegadi.

=== Pegadi ===
Pegadi is written in Java and development was started in the beginning of 1999. The system works like a word processor with note field and gives the editors the ability to see how much has been written on each article.

=== Aranea ===
Aranea is written in Java and uses technologies like JPA, Spring og Velocity. This is the CMS that serves the newspaper&#x27;s website underdusken.no.

<text>The Union of Horodło or Pact of Horodło was a set of three acts signed in the town of Horodło on 2 October 1413. The first act was signed by Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland, and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The second and third acts were composed by the Polish nobility (szlachta) and Lithuanian boyars, respectively. The union amended the earlier Polish–Lithuanian unions of Krewo and Vilnius–Radom. Politically, Lithuania received more autonomy as, after the death of Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobles could choose another Grand Duke instead of passing the title to Władysław II Jagiełło or his heir. However, culturally, Lithuania and Poland grew closer. Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes. Catholic Lithuanian nobles and church officials were granted equal rights with the Polish nobles and clergy. Forty-seven selected Lithuanian nobles were adopted by Polish families and granted Polish coats of arms. Thus the union signified the beginnings of the Polonization of Lithuanian culture and the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. It was one of the major steps towards the modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania.

==Historical background==
Poland and Lithuania had been joined in a personal union since the Union of Krewo of 1385. Both countries were ruled by Władysław II Jagiełło. However, after the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) and the Ostrów Agreement, Vytautas gained the supreme power in Lithuania. The legal basis for Polish–Lithuanian relations was revisited by the Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401, which reiterated &quot;de facto&quot; Lithuanian independence and &quot;de jure&quot; Polish supremacy. Vytautas was to be known by the title of Grand Duke (&quot;magnus dux&quot;) and enjoyed vast power in Lithuania, while technically he was subordinate to Władysław II Jagiełło, &#x27;Supreme Duke&#x27; (&quot;supremus dux&quot;) and King of Poland. The union was signed after Vytautas&#x27; army was soundly defeated in the Battle of the Vorskla River and weakened Lithuania was looking for Polish support. Taking advantage of the Lithuanian defeat, the Principality of Smolensk, Veliky Novgorod, and Pskov rebelled against Lithuanian rule, drawing Vytautas into a war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. However, within a few years peace was re-established in the east.

In 1409, the second Samogitian uprising against the Teutonic Knights escalated into the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. Joint Polish–Lithuanian forces defeated the Knights in the decisive Battle of Grunwald in 1410. However, the war did not resolve all the disputes and by 1413 Poland–Lithuania was preparing for another war with the Knights (see Hunger War). These developments encouraged Poland and Lithuania to review their relationship.

==Provisions==
The treaty repeated the indissoluble character of the Polish–Lithuanian union while carefully balancing Polish and Lithuanian interests. The Lithuanians gained more autonomy as they received the right to elect a new Grand Duke after the death of Vytautas. The earlier Union of Vilnius and Radom stipulated that Lithuania would pass to Władysław II Jagiełło or his heir. However, the Lithuanian nobles promised to consult the Polish nobles when choosing a successor to Vytautas. The reverse was also true: the Polish nobles promised to consult with the Lithuanians when electing the next Polish King. The pact contained one of the first mentions of the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish and Lithuanian nobles agreed to hold a joint general sejm to discuss all major matters, but such a sejm did not take place until 1564. Nevertheless, it was a recognition of the political powers of the Lithuanian nobles.

The Lithuanian nobles and clergy were granted equal rights with the Polish nobility and clergy. However, this extended only to Catholics; many Ruthenian nobles, who were Eastern Orthodox, were excluded, however, in 1434, Grand Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis repealed some of the provisions in the Horodło acts that limited the political rights of Orthodox believers. It would take until 1563 till there was full equality between the two confessions. Selected Lithuanian nobles, 47 in total, were adopted into Polish heraldic families and granted Polish coats of arm. This symbolic gesture signified their desire to adopt Western customs and integrate into Western society. Equal rights encouraged cooperation and kinship between Polish and Lithuanian nobles. The influence of Polish culture continued to increase, culminating in the Union of Lublin of 1569.

Another significant resolution was the adoption of Polish administrative divisions and offices like voivode and castellan by Lithuania. The union created the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius, governed by two Lithuanian nobles. Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political, social, and administrative features for another century. Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471, and another five voivodeships were established between 1504 and 1514. This administrative change signified the modernization of the Grand Duchy and a decline of traditional dynastic politics. Previously major regions of the Grand Duchy were ruled by members of the ruling dynasty (siblings, children, cousins, etc. of the Grand Duke). Such principalities remained semi-independent and their rulers could become powerful rivals of the Grand Duke with their own claims to the throne. The new voivodeships were governed by trustworthy nobles, unrelated to the royal clan, who could be easily replaced. Soon the nobility replaced members of the ruling dynasty as the driving force behind Lithuanian politics.

<text>Pedro Iarley Lima Dantas (born 29 March 1974), simply known as Iarley, is a Brazilian football coach and former player who played as an attacking midfielder or a forward.

==Club career==
Born in Quixeramobim, Ceará, Iarley played for Ferroviário, Ceará, and Paysandu of Brazil, Real Madrid B, AD Ceuta and UD Melilla of Spain, Boca Juniors of Argentina and Dorados de Sinaloa of Mexico. He joined Internacional for the 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro from Dorados de Sinaloa, where he played during the 2004-2005 season. Although Iarley impressed at Dorados in his first season, he also struggled with injuries, appearing in only nine games, registering three assists.

At Internacional, Iarley made a good impression at first, but then lost his place in the team that eventually won the Copa Libertadores in 2006 to wonderboy Rafael Sobis. After Sobis&#x27;s transfer to Real Betis, he took on the number 10 shirt and helped Inter win the FIFA Club World Cup in the same year.

In 2008, he moved on to Goiás. And in 2009, he scored 12 goals in Série A and his team made a good season despite finishing in 9th.

In the end of 2009, Iarley signed a contract with Corinthians. In the end of 2010, he moved to fellow Série A team Ceará .

Iarley retired from football on August 22, 2014, after leaving his first club Ferroviário.

<text>The Canadian Bank Note Company (CBNC) is a Canadian security printing company. It is best known for holding the contract with the Bank of Canada to supply it with Canada&#x27;s banknotes since 1935. The company&#x27;s other clients include private businesses, national and sub-national governments, central banks, and postal services from around the world. In addition to banknotes, the company produces passports, driver&#x27;s licences, birth certificates, postage stamps, coupons, and many other security-conscious document-related products. It also prints and provides document reading systems for identification cards, lottery tickets, stamps, and banknotes.

From 1897 until 1923, CBN was a unit of the New York–based American Bank Note Company (now known as ABCorp). It was later a privately held company when it was acquired by Ottawa businessman Charles Worthen; beginning in 1976 Douglas Arends slowly acquired control of the company. It has since been based in Ottawa, Ontario.

Since 2014, the Canadian Bank Note Company has been the chief provider for machine-readable passports used within the Caribbean Community bloc of countries. The majority of the new CARICOM passports as they are called serve the union as a centerpiece of promoting easy travel within the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME).

<text>The British Olympic Association (BOA; ) is the National Olympic Committee for the United Kingdom. It represents the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), but also incorporate representatives from eight of the eleven inhabited British Overseas Territories (but not British Virgin Islands, Bermuda or Caymen Islands which have their own national Olympic associations), and the three Crown Dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man), who do not have their own separate Olympics teams.

Athletes from Northern Ireland are also entitled, as of right, to represent Ireland (the team organised by the Olympic Federation of Ireland) and routinely do so in certain sports due to all-island governing bodies existing in those sports such as rugby, tennis and field hockey. 

Founded in 1905, The BOA is responsible for organising and overseeing the participation of athletes from the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team, branded as Team GB, at both the summer and winter Olympic Games, the Youth Olympic Games, the European Youth Olympic Festivals, and at the European Games. All the constituent members of the BOA compete and operate separately at the Commonwealth Games, and the BOA is not involved.

==BOA members and sporting bodies==
The British Olympic Association – responsible for Olympic participation of the United Kingdom comprising its constituent countries, the Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories which do not have their own NOC – competes at all summer, winter and youth Olympics as Great Britain (&quot;Team GB&quot;).

===Members===
The association comprises members from the following countries:

Note – Northern Irish athletes can choose whether to compete for Great Britain and Northern Ireland or for the Republic of Ireland, as they are entitled to citizenship of either nation under the Good Friday Agreement. However in a number of sports, including hockey, tennis and rugby sevens, Northern Irish athletes rarely represent Team GB because the designated federation only selects from those players who are active on the island of Great Britain (for example, Northern Ireland born hockey players who live and play in England). Jack McMillan, a Northern Ireland-born heat swimmer in the gold-medal winning men&#x27;s 4 x 200 freestyle relay British team in 2024, had previously swum for Team Ireland at the Olympics in 2021. 

The team that won the men&#x27;s 4 x 200 freestyle relay was unique in being the first gold medal relay team from Great Britain ever to contain membes from all four constituent countries: an Englishman (in fact two, Tom Dean and James Guy), a Northern Irishman (Jack McMillan), a Scotsman (Duncan Scott) and a Welshman (again two, Kieran Bird and Matt Richards).

Crown Dependencies:

A number of notable British Olympians and Olympic medalists have emerged from the Crown dependencies, including Carl Hester, four-time equestrian medalist from Guernsey and Mark Cavendish, track cycling silver medalist and Peter Kennaugh, gold winning team pursuiter, from the Isle of Man.
*
British Overseas Territories:

Some notable British Olympians have come from British Overseas Territories, though some have transferred sporting allegiance to England for Commonwealth Games purposes afterwards. Such a switch is not necessary to represent Team GB at the Olympic Games: Examples include Olympic bronze medalist sprinter Zharnel Hughes and long jumper Shara Proctor, both originally from Anguilla, and Delano Williams, another sprinter from Turks and Caicos Islands.

Note – IOC rules currently do not allow dependent territories to obtain recognition for National Olympic Committees (NOCs). Three British Overseas Territories have their own NOCs predating this rule and are therefore not connected with the BOA: Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. While the territories of British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are nominally represented by the BOA, these territories have no permanent population and do not send athletes. Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a pair of British military areas on the island of Cyprus, has a predominantly Cypriot population from day to day, and the British personnel there are all born elsewhere. As such, it also does not send athletes of its own to Team GB, not competes at the Commonwealth Games.

====Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories athletes for Team GB====
Among Crown Dependencies and current-day Overseas Territories, only a few have been represented on Team GB since 1930 (the year of the first Commonwealth Games) while retaining citizenship of, and (if the sport is held) Commonwealth Games eligibility for their territories. These include:
*Cameron Chalmers (Guernsey)
*Alastair Chalmers (Guernsey), his brother
*Alex Coleborn (Jersey)
*Mark Cavendish (Isle of Man)
*Peter Kennaugh (Isle of Man)
*Alexandra Jackson (Isle of Man)
*Marie Purvis (Isle of Man)
*Jonathan Bellis (Isle of Man)
*Georgina Cassar (Gibraltar)

Some more have participated in Team GB after switching Commonwealth Games eligibility mid-career from their territories to England before the Olympic Games, including:
*Shara Proctor (represented Anguilla until 2011, entered the Olympic Games in 2016)
*Zharnel Hughes (represented Anguilla until 2011, entered the Olympic Games in 2016)
*Delano Williams (represented Turks and Caicos Islands until 2012, entered the Olympic Games in 2016)

==Role==
The BOA is one of 206 National Committees (NOCs) currently recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC leads the promotion of Olympism in accordance with the Olympic Charter.

Working with the national governing bodies of each sport, the BOA selects Team GB&#x27;s members to compete in all sports at the summer and winter Olympics.
The BOA is independent and receives no funding from the government. Its income comes from fundraising and events.

Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland is one of only five National Olympic Committees (the others being Australia, France, Greece and Switzerland) which have never failed to be represented at the Summer Olympic Games since 1896. Of these countries GB&amp;NI, France and Switzerland are the only countries to have been present at all Olympic Winter Games; thus Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland is one of three countries that have competed at all Olympic Games. Great Britain is also the only team in the Olympic Games to have won a gold in every Summer games. The United Kingdom has hosted three Olympic Games, all of them in London: in 1908, 1948 and 2012.

==Structure==

At its formation in 1905 the association consisted of seven national governing body members from the following sports: fencing, life-saving, cycling, skating, rowing, athletics, rugby football, association football, and archery. It now includes as its members the thirty-three national governing bodies of each Olympic sport, both summer and winter.

A representative of each of the Olympic sports makes up the NOC, the BOA&#x27;s decision and policy-making body. The NOC elects three officers: a President, a Chairman, and a Vice-Chairman, each for a four-year term. Six members of the NOC are elected to the Board, which oversees the work of the BOA and puts forward proposals for decision by the NOC. The present (2022) chief office holders are:

* President: The Princess Royal
* Chairman: Sir Hugh Robertson

* CEO: Andy Anson

* Vice Chairman: Annamarie Phelps

==Former Chairmen==
* Sebastian Coe (2012 to 2016)
* Colin Moynihan (2005 to 2012)
* Craig Reedie (1992 to 2005)
* Arthur Gold (1988 to 1992)
* Charles Palmer (1983 to 1988)

==Founding==
The BOA&#x27;s origins pre-date the International Olympic movement and its governing body, the International Olympic Committee.

It traces its roots back to the National Olympian Association (NOA), which held its inaugural meeting at the Liverpool Gymnasium, Myrtle Street, Liverpool in November 1865. It promoted an annual series of sporting events across Britain, with the aim of encouraging participation in physical education through Olympian festivals. The NOA came about mainly through the efforts of John Hulley of Liverpool (Chairman), Dr William Penny Brookes (of Much Wenlock) and E G Ravenstein (president of the German Gymnastic Society of London). It took the existing Olympian Games of Much Wenlock as its example, thus the NOA Games &quot;were open to all comers&quot; and not just the products of Britain&#x27;s public schools.

After the NOA closed in 1883 its motto (&quot;Civium virtus civitatis tutamen&quot; meaning &#x27;the power of the citizens is the defence of the state&#x27;) and ethos were inherited by the National Physical Recreation Society (NPRS) which was founded in 1885. From 1902 the President and Treasurer of the NPRS were members of the Olympic &quot;Comité Britannique&quot; and the NPRS was a founding body of the British Olympic Association in 1905.

<text>The Murdock River (French: Rivière Murdock) is a river in Sudbury District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Lake Huron drainage basin and is a right tributary of the French River.

==Course==
The river begins at Mud Lake in geographic Servos Township in Unorganized North Sudbury District. It flows west through Graham Lake, turns south, and is crossed by the Canadian Pacific Railway main line. It enters Lovering Lake at the community of Paget, flows west under Ontario Highway 69 into Kakakiwaganda Lake, then turns sharply east back under Highway 69 to Round Lake. It heads south southeast, passes briefly through the northeast corner of geographic Cox Township, enters the municipality of French River, is crossed by Ontario Highway 64 and Ontario Highway 607, and reaches its mouth at the French River near the central community of French River.
