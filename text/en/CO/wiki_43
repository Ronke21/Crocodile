==History==

===Morristown School===

The Episcopal Church founded Morristown School as St. Bartholomew&#x27;s School in 1891. Rev. Frank E. Edwards, a graduate of Harvard University (1891), served as the school&#x27;s first headmaster, and classes took place in Morristown&#x27;s Normandy Park area. St. Bartholomew&#x27;s school was noted for hosting a speech by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes novels, in 1894.

Three years later, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s School moved its classes to Whippany Road after building a new campus near the Morristown railroad station. Designed by architects Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring (co-designers of Ellis Island&#x27;s Immigrant Station), the buildings for this campus required only 90 days to construct. The blended Colonial Revival and Classical Revival architecture styles reflect the colonial history of the Morristown area. Ford Mansion in Morristown (now part of Morristown National Historical Park) served as one of George Washington&#x27;s headquarters during the American Revolutionary War.

When St. Bartholomew&#x27;s School faced financial challenges in late 1897, three of its teachers from Harvard University Class of 1888 reorganized St. Bartholomew&#x27;s School as the Morristown School. These three co-founders of Morristown School were Francis Call Woodman, Arthur Pierce Butler, and Thomas Quincy Browne. Aiding their work to start the new school, a large donation from wealthy businessman Henry Lee Higginson (known for founding the Boston Symphony Orchestra) provided critical seed funding. The school also benefited from large financial gifts of three other notable philanthropists: businessmen Charles Francis Adams III, Larz Anderson III, and Joseph Lee. Adams (a great-grandson of President John Quincy Adams) and Anderson (a son of General Nicholas Longworth Anderson) graduated from Harvard in the same class year as Morristown School&#x27;s co-founders. (Lee graduated from Harvard five years earlier.)

Morristown School prepared its students for Harvard University, other Ivy League schools, and engineering schools. The school opened in September 1898 with 23 students and eight staff members. Just two years later, enrollment more than tripled to educate 75 students; the student body increased to 173 by 1923. In 1908, Morristown School achieved recognition as one of only two schools outside New England to send students to Harvard for ten consecutive years (1899–1908). Strengthening the connection with Harvard, Morristown School leaders hosted the Harvard Club of New Jersey. The club&#x27;s April 1909 meeting brought visits from Harvard President Charles Eliot, New Jersey Governor John Fort, and New Jersey Chancellor Mahlon Pitney (later a U.S Supreme Court justice). Eleven years later, the Morristown School ran a $500,000 fundraising campaign to establish an endowment. Several Harvard graduates served on the campaign&#x27;s executive committee, including graduates of Harvard and the Morristown School (writer Roger Burlingame, journalist Samuel T. Williamson, and businessman Felix Knauth).

During World War I, 65 of Morristown School&#x27;s first 103 graduates (63%) served in the U.S. military. Their service reflected the value of community service emphasized by Morristown School to its student body. During the war, students at the school raised funds to purchase and equip the Morristown School Ambulance. They then presented this ambulance to the American Field Service for use in France. The American Field Service awarded Morristown School a certificate and a brass plaque to show its appreciation for the ambulance. In 1913, a group of 40 of Morristown School&#x27;s students helped the Morristown Fire Department extinguish a forest fire that had spread over three miles on Horse Hill; the students used portable chemical extinguishers to fight the flames. Nine years later, the full student body (173 students) helped fight a large fire that had destroyed two nearby houses. In 1957, the basketball team donated a trophy to Delbarton School (the school rival) to honor Paul Kreutz, a Delbarton player who drowned in 1956.

===Beard School===

In 1891, sisters Lucie Beard, Eliza Mills Beard, and Ettie Beard Foster started a school for kindergarten students on Claredon Place in Orange, New Jersey. The three sisters were cousins of historian James Truslow Adams, a Pulitzer Prize winning writer. Eliza Beard oversaw the school&#x27;s financial management, and Lucie Beard ran the educational activities. Their mother, Hester Truslow Beard, also assisted with the establishment of the school. The Beard school had an initial enrollment of 13 students. The all-girls school moved to Berkley Avenue in 1900 and continued adding grades until it graduated its first class in 1903. Taking the role of a preparatory country day school, Beard School prepared its students for the Seven Sisters and other colleges and universities.

Earning notoriety for this purpose, the Beard School received financial support from capitalist Sidney Morse Colgate of Colgate-Palmolive. In 1928, the school hosted a speech by Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick, a social justice activist, at its commencement ceremony. Fosdick&#x27;s visit reflected Beard School&#x27;s commitment to service for its student body. During World War I, the students made bandages and wound dressings and began a tradition of sewing and knitting items to donate to the American Red Cross. This tradition extended into and past the Great Depression of the 1930s. During World War II, Beard School&#x27;s students worked for the Junior Red Cross and assisted the American war effort by contributing their time and money.

On November 30, 1953, a large fire swept through Beard School&#x27;s campus in the middle of the night. Reaching a peak of fifty feet in the air, the fire engulfed two of the school&#x27;s five buildings and left them unusable. The fire destroyed an auditorium, 16 classrooms, and Beard School&#x27;s gymnasium. After calling the fire department, Headmistress Edith Sutherland awakened the 20 boarding students and led them to safety on the school&#x27;s front lawn.

Salvaging wood from the school&#x27;s ruined buildings, a machinist repairman who lived nearby built a two-story garage for his family&#x27;s home. His daughter later penned an essay about her childhood that described her memories surrounding the fire. Submitting the essay to Unico National, an Italian-American service organization, she earned second place in their Ella T. Grasso literary contest. Rebuilding, Beard School launched the Beard Fund campaign in Fall 1954 to fund construction of a new building to replace the two buildings devastated by the fire. The campaign hosted a Hawaiian-themed benefit dance on October 22, 1954, to raise some of the funds. In the spring of that school year, the Beard School opened the new fireproof building for use by classes. Eleven years later, the Beard School had discussions with Short Hills Country Day School about a potential merger of the two schools. The two schools did not merge, however. Short Hills Country Day School later merged with the Pingry School in Bernards, New Jersey.

===Morristown Beard School===

The all-boys Morristown School merged with the all-girls Beard School in 1971. The new co-ed school elected to use Morristown School&#x27;s campus in Morristown and close the Beard School&#x27;s campus in Orange. (The former campus of the Beard School now houses the White House Healthcare &amp; Rehabilitation Center.) On Prize Day, June 5, 1971, the Morristown School officially transitioned into Morristown Beard School, a name chosen to reflect the importance of the history of its predecessor schools.

Recognizing their collective legacy, Morristown Beard School adopted the Beard School&#x27;s Latin motto of (&quot;Ad Astra per Aspera&quot;) and the Morristown School&#x27;s school shield. (The Morristown School had two Latin mottos: &quot;Civitas&quot; and &quot;Orbis Aratro Pendet&quot;. The former means citizenship, and the latter means: &quot;The world hangs in the work of the plow.&quot;) Morristown Beard School also renamed its Main Building as Beard Hall. The first class of the school graduated in June 1972. Twenty-two years later in 1994, the school expanded its Middle School&#x27;s student body from two grades (7–8) to three (6–8).

Morristown-Beard was the subject to a sex-scandal in 2011 due to a sexual relationship between a student, Sharon Zelnick, and a teacher, Edward Sherman. The couple where engaged in a sexual relationship since at least 2010, a date an MBS employee went on record stating he saw Zelnick and Sherman engage in a physical relationship. The relationship was made apparent to Sharon&#x27;s parents when she feigned an illness during a school trip to Greece in 2011 and was &#x27;chaperoned&#x27; by Sherman until she recovered which went against school rules. The school initially requested Zelnick&#x27;s parents be lenient to Sherman, but claimed to have no knowledge of the relationship at the time. By December 2011 MBS administration received numerous calls from concerned parents about the relationship, and performed an internal investigation, but never notified the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) with parents having to go directly to the DCPP to get them involved. Shortly after the DCPP got involved Sherman fled to Israel and following her graduation after not physically attending classes Senior year Sharon also moved to Israel. Sharon&#x27;s parents sued the school in December 2015 for gross negligence, breach of contract, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Shortly after the DCPP began their investigation in 2011 headmaster Alex Curtis stepped down, being replaced by Peter Caldwell. In 2016 the lawsuit was dismissed as the judge ruled Sharon&#x27;s parents had no standing to sue, and that only Sharon herself could sue, but the judge did acknowledge that Sharon was sexually assaulted by Sherman.

Many notable figures have visited Morristown Beard School to speak to students, faculty, and staff. Colonel Jack H. Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient, spoke on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend in 2015. Jacobs received the medal for bravery during the Vietnam War. Other notable speakers have included: businesswoman Bobbi Brown, authors Rachel Simmons and Bryan Burrough, and Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen.

During the George Floyd protests three seniors where recorded saying slurs and mocking George Floyd. Following this the three students had their admissions to various prestigious colleges revoked. Following the incident the Headmaster, Peter Caldwell, stepped down and Elizabeth Morrison was brought in to reshape school culture to be more diverse and inclusive and to empower the school&#x27;s black students, however, this sudden change in management has been met with some push back with many of the teachers seeking employment elsewhere.

==Facilities==
Supported by a $16.2 million capital campaign, Morristown Beard School constructed the Middle School building and Founders Hall, a performing arts facility. The Middle School building opened during fall 2008, and Founders Hall, which houses a 630-seat surround-sound theatre, opened during winter 2009. In 2011, Morristown Beard School transformed Wilkie Hall, which had previously contained the performing arts center, into a technology center with multiple computer labs.

Renovated in 2004, Grant Hall now houses the Center for Academic Writing, the English Department, and the World Languages Department. That year, Morristown Beard also opened the renovated Beard Hall with space for Anderson Library and offices for the History Department, College Counseling, Admissions, and the Headmaster. In 2007, the school renovated South Wing, which now houses the MBS Center for Teaching and Learning (formerly the Center for Learning) and visual arts classrooms. Morristown Beard School&#x27;s students have access to a film production studio with a green screen, a studio for multi-track digital audio recording, and a post-production studio.

From 2016 to 2017 a large renovation and construction project took place in the north-western corner of Morristown Beard&#x27;s campus which saw the demolition of the old Math Building and the Science Annex to make away for the new &quot;Math and Science building&quot;. The original math building was a Depression era residential building, while the Science annex where two double-wide trailers that where constructed as &quot;temporary&quot; classrooms and where in-use for 15 years. The new Math and Science building was connected via an annex to the dining hall, while the old science classrooms under the dining hall where renovated into a collaborative technological space. The renovations cost over $30 million that was the result of a 10 to 12 year fundraiser. The building was designed by NK Architects and completed in time to be opened for the 2017 school-year.

In 2021 the school dedicated its main quad to the Class of 2020 due to their graduation and senior year being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

== School-wide iPad program ==

===2010–2011 iPad pilot===

In the fall of 2010, Morristown Beard School became one of the first schools in the U.S. to integrate the iPad tablet made by Apple Inc. into its curriculum. For their pilot program, six teachers and 60 students used iPads inside and outside the classroom. During the pilot program, executives from Apple, Inc. visited Morristown Beard School to observe how their iPads enhanced instructional practices and stimulated students&#x27; learning.

===Campus iPad integration===

Beginning with the 2011–2012 academic year, Morristown Beard School now requires all students to purchase an iPad and use the tablet device to assist schoolwork.

Morristown Beard School also runs a dedicated 1000 Mbit/s Wi-Fi network to enable students&#x27; and faculty iPads to access the Internet.

In 2013, Morristown Beard School equipped all classrooms on its campus and many of the school&#x27;s public spaces with ceiling mounted LCD projectors and wireless media streaming through Apple TV. That year, students Graham Dyer and Lena Rajan created the MBS Now app for iPads to help members of the school community quickly access information about school happenings. The MBS Now app provides information on class schedules, homework assignments, school calendars, lunch menus, extracurricular activities, athletic competitions, and school news. The app also provides school forms for various activities and information on senior projects. Members of the Morristown Beard School community contribute content to MBS Now by posting updates at the app&#x27;s home portal. Publication of the source code for each update to MBS Now on GitHub enables students at other K–12 schools to develop similar iOS apps.

Due to being one of the first school&#x27;s in the country to implement a 1:1 iPad program, Morristown Beard was recognized as an Apple Distinguished School since 2024.

<text>The Southwestern Front was a front of the Red Army during the Second World War, formed thrice.

It was first created on June 22, 1941 from the Kiev Special Military District. The western boundary of the front in June 1941 was 865 km long, from the Pripyat River and the town of Wlodawa to the Prut River and the town of Lipkany at the border with Romania. It connected to the north with the Western Front, which extended to the Lithuanian border, and to the south with the Southern Front, which extended to the city of Odessa on the Black Sea.

==Operational history==
The Southwestern Front was on the main axis of attack by the German Army Group South during Operation Barbarossa. At the outbreak of war with Germany, the Front was commanded by Mikhail Kirponos and contained the Soviet 5th, 6th, 26th, and 12th Armies along the frontier. 16th and 19th Armies were in reserve behind the forward forces. These forces took part in the tank battles in western Ukraine and were surrounded and destroyed at the Battle of Uman and the Battle of Kiev (1941) in August and September 1941. Kirponos himself was killed during the Battle of Kiev.

The Front was immediately re-established with new forces. During the period of the Battle of Moscow it was under the command of Marshal Timoshenko, and included from north to south the 40th, 21st, 38th and 6th Armies. It was formally disbanded on July 12, 1942 and the forces transferred to the Stalingrad Front and Southern Front.

The Front was reformed from reserve armies on October 22, 1942. It was renamed the 3rd Ukrainian Front on October 20, 1943. 3rd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s first operations were the Battle of the Dnieper and the Battle of Kiev (1943).

<doc id="1283152" wikidata="Q7247333" url="?curid=1283152" title="Procession of the Species">
<text>The Procession of the Species Celebration is an annual, community arts-based Earth Day celebration in Olympia, Washington. It is the largest annual Earth Day celebration in the Puget Sound area and Cascadia bioregion.

The procession features a parade of costumed individuals and groups, non-motorized floats, and puppets with animal and element themes. Procession rules do not allow live pets, motorized vehicles, candy, or words. The procession began in 1995, operates without government support, and has earned national recognition.

==History==
Started in 1995 by a group of Olympia residents, the procession was originally created to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day and to support Congressional renewal of the Endangered Species Act. A virtual procession was conducted in 2020.

==About==
Taking place during Olympia&#x27;s annual Spring Arts Walk, the procession regularly draws 30,000 spectators and 2,000–3,000 participants. The celebration, now in its 20th year, is completely noncommercial, made possible by community contributions of money, materials, time, and skills. The procession is produced by Earthbound Productions, a 501(c)(3) organization, which currently does not benefit from any public funding from the City of Olympia. Seven weeks before the procession, organizers establish a community art studio, open to the public for a minimal, optional donation. As there is no permanent studio space available for the procession, each year Earthbound Productions locates and rents a space to serve as the community art studio; ultimately, the group hopes to find a permanent location. The studio, staffed by volunteers, hosts art, music and costume design workshops. Participants use a wide range of artistic approaches, such as batik, papier mache, and luminaria. They use mostly donated or scavenged materials to express appreciation for the natural world and create costumes, banners, floats, puppets, drumming, community bands, and more. People of all ages join the procession itself, bedecked in costumes featuring the elements and various species of plants and animals. The procession has three rules: no live pets, no motorized vehicles, and no written words.

==Influence and Recognition==
Inspired by Olympia&#x27;s event, Procession of the Species celebrations have taken place elsewhere in the US and around the world. The procession in Bellingham, Washington, has taken place since 2004. It is a nationally recognized model for community arts-based involvement, environmental education, arts education, and cultural exchange.

In its July 2009 &quot;Best of America&quot; feature, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine honored the Procession of the Species with the top spot in its &quot;can&#x27;t resist&quot; parades and processions list, after having considered 50,000 other celebrations in the United States.

<text>Interlake was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1979, and has formally existed since the 1981 provincial election. Previously, much of the Interlake region was included in the constituency of St. George. As its name implies, Interlake was located between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba, in the mid-northern section of the province.

Interlake was bordered to the east by Lake Winnipeg, to the south by Lakeside and Gimli, to the north by Swan River, and to the west by Lake Manitoba. Communities in the riding include Arborg, Riverton, Ashern, Fraserwood. The Black and Deer Islands are also located in the riding.

Prior to the 2019 Manitoba general election, Interlake was abolished and its area was redistributed to the new riding of Interlake-Gimli.

In 1996, the riding&#x27;s population was 18,653. In 1999, the average family income was $32,570, and the unemployment rate was 10.60%. Twenty-two per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income. Almost 25% of the riding&#x27;s residents have less than a Grade 9 education.

Agriculture accounts for 22% of Interlake&#x27;s industry, followed by government services at 13%.

Interlake had been represented continuously by members of the New Democratic Party since its creation. That ended with the 2016 election. In 1995, local members of the Progressive Conservative Party attempted to rig the voting results by promoting a candidate from Independent Native Voice, a minor party. The plan was unsuccessful, but caused a major provincial scandal when its details were revealed to the public in 1998-99.

<doc id="1283183" wikidata="Q3239108" url="?curid=1283183" title="Line F (Buenos Aires Underground)">
<text>Line F is a planned addition to the Buenos Aires Underground. In 2019, the government of Buenos Aires was looking for a group to create a plan of the line, but this study was cancelled in 2022. The city decided to create a study with their own staff, which is still underway as of 2024. The estimated cost of the project has risen from 800 million dollars, to 2 billion USD.

==Overview==

Permission to construct the line was originally granted in 2001, in a sanction which also included lines H (partially completed) and line I (not started).

The line is set to be the most modern in the network, using automatic trains, a communications-based train control system like the one being installed on Line C, and platform screen doors. 

The line is also expected to have the highest ridership when compared to the existing lines, at 600,000 riders annually. In the 2019 tender, eight of the thirteen stations were connected to other lines on the network.

===Line E ghost stations===
In 2006, it was considered whether the two Line E ghost stations (San José vieja and Constitución) could be used as the southern point of Line F, considering they overlapped the line&#x27;s trajectory. However, it was later decided that Line F would use a completely new tunnel with new stations given the frequency the line is expected to have.

<doc id="1283185" wikidata="Q15620" url="?curid=1283185" title="Esparreguera">
<text>Esparreguera (; ) is a municipality in Catalonia, in the province of Barcelona, Spain. It is situated in the comarca of el Baix Llobregat. 

Esparreguera is famous in Catalonia for staging a grand version of the play &quot;Life and Passion of Jesus Christ&quot; every year in March and April, on the Sundays before and after Easter. The play is popularly known as &quot;La Passió d&#x27;Esparreguera&quot;. Over 300 actors, 50 technicians and 100 musicians participate in the play during five acts, twenty scenographic settings and more than five hours of drama, from the election of the apostles until the resurrection of Jesus.

The grand scale of the show is achieved with the volunteer contribution of the citizens of the town, in a tradition that dates back to Esparreguera&#x27;s medieval origins. This tradition has made Esparreguera one of the cradles of Catalan performing arts, giving birth to actors such as the sisters Anna and Lola Lizaran, or the contemporary dancer Ramon Oller. 

Shakira&#x27;s music video for &quot;Empire&quot; was filmed in Esparreguera.

<doc id="1283194" wikidata="Q7714891" url="?curid=1283194" title="The Augments">
<text>&quot;The Augments&quot; is the sixth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the eighty-second episode overall. It is the last of a three-story episode arc, preceded by &quot;Borderland&quot;, and &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;. &quot;The Augments&quot; was directed by LeVar Burton, from a script by Michael Sussman.

The series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. In this episode, &quot;Augments&quot;, genetically enhanced humans, and Doctor Arik Soong, their surrogate father, escape Cold Station 12 after stealing frozen Augment embryos from storage. Soong plans to hide out with the Augments and raise the embryos, but Malik, their leader, is tired of hiding and attempts to instigate a war between Starfleet and the Klingons.

The production of the episode reunites fellow &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; alumni Burton as the director and Brent Spiner as Arik Soong. On &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, Burton previously played Geordi La Forge, while Spiner played Data. Most of the guest cast from the previous two &quot;Enterprise&quot; episodes in the story arc returned for &quot;The Augments&quot;; Mark Rolston makes an appearance as Klingon Captain Magh. The sets were also reused, but a new one was built for the Klingon escape pod used by Soong. UPN first aired &quot;The Augments&quot; on November 12, 2004, where it was watched by 2.1 percent of the U.S. population. It received mixed reviews from critics, who spoke negatively of Malik&#x27;s character, but praised the performance of Spiner as Soong and the relationship between T&#x27;Pol and Tucker.

==Plot==
At the end of &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;, Doctor Arik Soong and the Augments he secretly raised depart the space station, taking with them 1,800 frozen Augment embryos preserved from the time of the Eugenics Wars. Malik also steals pathogen samples from the station and sets the containment fields to fail. In &quot;The Augments&quot;, Captain Archer restores stasis around the central compound, and is beamed from space to safety, with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in pursuit of Soong, Malik, and the Augments on their stolen Bird of Prey. Soong and the Augments arrive in Klingon space where he shares his plan: Soong intends to hide out in a region (the Briar Patch) where Starfleet would have trouble tracking them down. Malik objects to Soong&#x27;s plan, noting that Khan Noonien Singh also ran away on the SS &quot;Botany Bay&quot;.

In pursuit of the Augments, &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives in Klingon space having faked a Klingon warp signature. Soong releases a hostage on a Denobulan shuttle into a gas giant, forcing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to abandon their pursuit and mount a rescue operation. Escaping, Malik proposes a new plan: trigger a war between Starfleet and the Klingons as a distraction by firing a pathogen-filled torpedo at a Klingon colony. He reasons that Starfleet will be too busy fighting the Klingons to hunt down the Augments. Soong will have nothing to do with Malik&#x27;s genocidal proposal. On the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Commander T&#x27;Pol asks Commander Tucker about the distance between them after her recent arranged marriage, and he tells her he has come to terms with their new relationship.

Back on the Bird of Prey, Soong works on a way to remove aggressive behavior from the unborn Augment embryos. Malik, concerned by Soong&#x27;s plan to hide from Starfleet and his tampering with the embryos, leads a mutiny which confines Soong to his quarters. With the help of Persis, Soong leaves the ship in an escape pod. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, once again in pursuit, detects the pod and brings Soong on board. Heading towards the Klingon colony in high warp in an attempt to stop Malik&#x27;s plan, the Klingons detect their ship. &quot;Enterprise&quot; is forced to disable a Klingon cruiser when it tries to board. Malik kills Persis for her betrayal, and continues with his plan to attack the Klingons. Scans of the &quot;Qu&#x27;vat&quot; colony reveal three main population centers; the torpedo is armed with pathogens and prepared for deployment.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives late, just after Malik fires the torpedo, but &quot;Enterprise&quot; destroys it, saving the Klingon colony. Soong helps disable the Klingon ship, hoping to save some of the Augments. However, Malik scuttles the Klingon ship, killing the remaining Augments and the embryos, and transports himself onto &quot;Enterprise&quot; in an attempt to kill Soong in revenge, but Archer manages to kill Malik first. The Klingons call off their retaliation against Earth, and Soong returns to the Starfleet Detention Center. In custody, he begins to doubt the feasibility of genetically engineering humans and wonders if perfecting artificial life has better prospects for the future.

==Production==

&quot;The Augments&quot; is the final episode in a three-part story which began with &quot;Borderland&quot; and continued in &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;. The return of genetically enhanced humans, as seen in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Space Seed&quot; and &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, links &quot;Enterprise&quot; to &quot;The Original Series&quot;.

The episode reunites Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton, two &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; alumni. Spiner played the role of the android Data and Burton played chief engineer Geordi La Forge. Spiner appeared in all instalments of the three-story arc, while Burton only directed &quot;The Augments&quot;. Burton directed three episodes of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the third season. To celebrate their collaboration, as well as acknowledge the crew members who had remained with the franchise since their series, Burton bought lunch on the final day of shooting for everyone on the set. The episode was written by Mike Sussman, his second of the season after &quot;Home&quot;.

Shooting began on September 2 and lasted for seven days, with the production taking time off for Labor Day. The majority of the sets on the episode were created for &quot;Borderland&quot; or &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;. The scene depicting a Klingon escape pod required the construction of a new set. Spiner, as well as several other guest stars, resumed their roles from earlier in the story arc, including Alec Newman as Malik, Richard Riehle as Doctor Jeremy Lucas, Abby Brammell as Persis and Adam Grimes as Lokesh. Joining them was Mark Rolston as the Klingon Captain Magh; Rolston previously appeared in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; as Walter Pierce in the episode &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, and also played Kuroda in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Canamar&quot;.

==Reception==
UPN first broadcast &quot;The Augments&quot; on November 12, 2004. According to overnight Nielsen ratings, 2.1 percent of the population of the United States and four percent of those watching television at the time viewed the episode. &quot;The Augments&quot; received the same ratings as the previous episode, &quot;Cold Station 12&quot;. However, it moved up to fourth place in the 8 p.m. timeslot, narrowly beating &quot;What I Like About You&quot; and &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; on The WB.

&quot;IGN&quot; gave the episode 3.5 out of five, and wrote: &quot;&quot;The Augments&quot; doesn&#x27;t deliver as strongly as I&#x27;d have hoped, it is still an engaging hour of television that clearly shows &quot;Enterprise&quot; is going in a new direction.&quot; Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation, said that Malik had become a &quot;cardboard villain&quot; by the time of &quot;The Augments&quot;, but she did not blame Alec Newman for this. She also criticised the use of Persis&#x27; death by Malik, saying that he defined her &quot;even in death as a commodity for his use&quot;. Green praised the relationship between T&#x27;Pol and Tucker and the characterisation of Soong, noting that Spiner&#x27;s performance was the best of the three-episode arc.

Writing for &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot;, Jamahl Epsicokhan gave the episode a rating of two out of four. He criticised Malik, noting that the &quot;crux of the story is reduced to an unremarkable three-character power struggle that is supposed to be a microcosm for the trouble that comes with genetically engineered super-humans, but comes across instead as overly bland and tidy drama.&quot; Spiner &quot;delivers a good performance under the circumstances&quot;, notes Epsicokhan, as his character has to believe that Malik will not overthrow his leadership of the Augments. Summing up the episode, Epsicokhan writes:

In a review for &quot;Big Shiny Robot&quot;, Andy Wilson said that the story represented the &quot;personal journey&quot; of Arik Soong from genetic engineering to cybernetics. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised casting Brent Spiner as the character Arik Soong.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; interviewed various cast and production crew of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise to determine the &quot;100 Greatest Episodes&quot; from across the five series, ranking &quot;Borderland&quot;/&quot;Cold Station 12&quot;/&quot;The Augments&quot; as the 96th best episode of all time. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; writer James Hunt ranked the mini-arc as the sixth best story of &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Home media release==
A home media release of &quot;The Augments&quot; was originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005, as part of the season four DVD box set of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.

<text>Drikung Kagyü or Drigung Kagyü (Wylie: &#x27;bri-gung bka&#x27;-brgyud) is one of the eight &quot;minor&quot; lineages of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. &quot;Major&quot; here refers to those Kagyü lineages founded by the immediate disciples of Gampopa (1079-1153), while &quot;minor&quot; refers to all the lineages founded by disciples of Gampopa&#x27;s main disciple, Phagmo Drupa (1110-1170). One of these disciples, Jigten Sumgön (1143-1217), is the founder of Drikung.

== History ==
Like with all other Kagyu lineages, origins of Drikung Kagyü can be traced back to the Great Indian Master Tilopa who passed on his teachings to Mahasiddha Naropa who lived around 10th and 11th century. The founder of the Drikung Kagyü lineage was Jigten Sumgön (1143-1217) of the Kyura clan, who was the disciple of Phagmo Drupa. According to historical account from the time, Jigten Sumgön&#x27;s teachings attracted more than 100,000 people at a time, with the highest number of attendance recorded at 130,000.

Several sub-schools branched off from the Drikung Kagyü including the Lhapa or Lhanangpa Kagyü, founded by Nö Lhanangpa (, 1164–1224) who came to Bhutan in 1194. This school was at one time important in Western Bhutan, particularly in the Thimphu and Paro regions, where they were rivals of the Drukpa Kagyü. The Lhapa first came into conflict with the early Drukpa teacher, Phajo Drugom Zhigpo (b. 12th century) and finally with Ngawang Namgyal (1594–1651). In 1640 the remaining followers of the Lhapa Kagyü were expelled from Bhutan together with the Nenyingpa followers as both had sided with the attacking Tsangpa forces against the Drukpa during their three invasions of Bhutan and continued to refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Shabdrung.

==Teaching and practice==
The unique doctrines of Drikung Kagyü as taught by its founder, Jigten Sumgön is preserved in the &quot;Single Intention&quot; or &quot;One Thought&quot; (&quot;Gongchig&quot;, Wylie: dgongs gcig) and &quot;The Essence of Mahāyāna Teachings&quot; (Wylie: theg chen bstan pa&#x27;i snying po). According to Jampa MacKenzie Stewart, the &quot;Gonchik&quot; &quot;recasts Buddhism in a fascinating and innovative form, emphasizing each aspect as being capable of revealing the full process of enlightenment.&quot; 

The main practices of Drikung Kagyü are “The Five-fold Profound Path of Mahamudrā,” and “The Six Dharmas of Nāropa.” The five-fold Mahamudrā, also known as the &quot;possessing five&quot;, consists of five elements:

* Setting the motivation, arousing bodhichitta, 
* Deity yoga, generating the Yidam. The main deity in Drikung is Chakrasamvara (in union with consort Vajravarahi), but Milarepa taught this method by using Chenrezig.
* Guru yoga
* Mahamudrā meditation (Samatha and Vipasyana)
* Dedication of merit. 

This practice is traditionally cultivated in retreat alongside the Six Dharmas of Naropa, and it is preceded by the preliminary practices called &quot;ngondro&quot;. 

This presentation is outlined in &quot;Clarifying the Jewel Rosary of the Profound Five-Fold Path&quot; by Kunga Rinchen, the Dharma heir to Jigten Sumgön. 

The Drikung Kagyü also have a tradition of Dzogchen teachings, the &quot;Yangzab Dzogchen&quot;. It is based on termas revealed by the Drikung Tertön (hidden treasure revealer), Rinchen Phuntsog in the sixteenth century.

===Phowa===
The Drikung lineage is popularly known for its development of the practice of Phowa, in which a practitioner learns how to expel his/her consciousness or mindstream through the posterior fontanelle at the top of the skull at the moment of death. One of the Six Yogas of Naropa, this practice is said to aid the practitioner in remaining aware through the death experience, thus aiding one in attaining enlightenment in the Bardo (the state in between death and the next rebirth) or in achieving a birth conducive to the practice of Dharma.

==Monasteries and centers==

The first and main Drikung Kagyü monastery is Drikung Thil Monastery, founded in 1179 by Jigten Sumgön approximately 150 kilometers northeast of Lhasa.

Aside from the Drikung Valley in Ü, the Drikung Kagyu has a strong presence in Nangqên County in what was Kham, in western Tibet (including Kailash), and in Ladakh. Tsari and Lapchi - two important sacred sites for all Tibetan Buddhists - also have a strong Drikung Kagyu presence. Among the so-called &quot;four major and eight minor&quot; Kagyu lineages, Drikung Kagyu is one of four Kagyu lineages that continue to exist as independent institutions (the other three being the Karma Kagyu, Drukpa Lineage and Taklung Kagyu).

Outside of Tibet, the headquarters for the tradition in exile is Jangchubling, located in Dhera Dun, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.

Drikung Kagyu is one of the most prominent lineages in Ladakh where its main monasteries are Phyang and Lamayuru, with roughly 50 other monasteries spread across Ladakh region.

A series of Drikung Dharma centers were also founded in the West, a project begun by Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche in 1978.

==Lineage notes==
===Spiritual heads===

From the founding of Drikung Thil Monastery in 1179 to the present day, the Drikung Kagyü lineage has been led by a succession of spiritual heads (&quot;throne-holders&quot;). One of the two current heads of the lineage, Drikung Kyabgön Chetsang Rinpoche, Könchok Tenzin Kunzang Thinley Lhundrup (b. 1946), the 37th Drikungpa resides at Drikung Kagyü Institute at Dehra Dun, India. The other head of the Drikung Kagyü Lineage, the 36th Drikungpa, Drikung Kyabgön Chungtsang Rinpoche, Könchok Tenzin Chökyi Nangwa (b. 1942) lives in Lhasa, Tibet.

===Female protector===
Another unique feature of the Drikung lineage is its female dharmapāla, Achi Chokyi Drolma. The great-grandmother of Jigten Sumgön, she prophesied his birth and vowed to protect those in his lineage. She is unusual in that she is both a female protector and an enlightened bodhisattva that can be taken as an iṣṭadevatā in meditation practice. She is depicted either sitting on a horse or standing with a kapala in her left hand and a mirror in her right hand. Achi&#x27;s practice became so popular that she has been included in other lineages, such as the Karma Kagyu.

===First nun===
In 2002 Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, became the first bhikkhuni (a fully ordained Buddhist nun) in the Drikung Kagyü lineage. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyü lineage, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery (America&#x27;s first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery, located in Vermont) in 2004.

<doc id="1283229" wikidata="Q2142532" url="?curid=1283229" title="Eugene Garfield">
<text>Eugene Eli Garfield (September 16, 1925 – February 26, 2017) was an American linguist and businessman, one of the founders of bibliometrics and scientometrics. He helped to create &quot;Current Contents&quot;, &quot;Science Citation Index&quot; (SCI), &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, and &quot;Index Chemicus&quot;, among others, and founded the magazine &quot;The Scientist&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Garfield was born in 1925 in New York City as Eugene Eli Garfinkle, his mother being of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry. His parents were second generation immigrants living in East Bronx in New York City. He studied at the University of Colorado and University of California, Berkeley before getting a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1949. Garfield also received a degree in Library Science from Columbia University in 1953. He went on to do his PhD in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, which he completed in 1961 for developing an algorithm for translating chemical nomenclature into chemical formulas.

==Career and research==
Working as a laboratory assistant at Columbia University after his graduation, Garfield indexed all previously synthesized compounds so that not to remake them, which helped him understand that his inclination to information towards science was bigger than towards chemistry. 

In 1951, he got a position at the Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where most of the National Library of Medicine information systems were developed. There he built search and cataloging system methods using punch-cards. In 1953, at the First Symposium on Machine Methods in Scientific Documentation, Garfield got introduced to Shepard&#x27;s Citations.

In 1960, Garfield founded the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), which was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, ISI was faced with bankruptcy and was acquired by JPT Holdings who later sold it to Thomson (Thomas Business Information) where it formed a major part of the science division of Thomson Reuters. In October 2016 Thomson Reuters completed the sale of its intellectual property and science division; it is now known as Clarivate Analytics.

Garfield was responsible for many innovative bibliographic products, including &quot;Current Contents&quot;, the &quot;Science Citation Index&quot; (SCI), and other citation databases, the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, and &quot;Index Chemicus&quot;. He was the founding editor and publisher of &quot;The Scientist&quot;, a news magazine for life scientists. In 2003, the University of South Florida School of Information was honored to have him as lecturer for the Alice G. Smith Lecture. In 2007, he launched Histcite, a bibliometric analysis and visualization software package.

Following ideas inspired by Vannevar Bush&#x27;s highly cited 1945 article &quot;As We May Think&quot;, Garfield undertook the development of a comprehensive citation index showing the propagation of scientific thinking; he started the Institute for Scientific Information in 1956 (it was sold to the Thomson Corporation in 1992). According to Garfield, &quot;the citation index ... may help a historian to measure the influence of an article — that is, its &#x27;impact factor&#x27;&quot;. The creation of the &quot;Science Citation Index&quot; made it possible to calculate impact factor, which ostensibly measures the importance of scientific journals. It led to the unexpected discovery that a few journals like &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; were core for all of hard science. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.

His entrepreneurial flair in having turned what was, at least at the time, an obscure and specialist metric into a highly profitable business has been noted. A scientometric analysis of his top fifty cited papers has been conducted.

Garfield&#x27;s work led to the development of several information retrieval algorithms, like the HITS algorithm and PageRank. Both use the structured citation between websites through hyperlinks. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin acknowledged Gene in their development of PageRank, the algorithm that powers their company&#x27;s search engine. Garfield published over 1,000 essays.

==Honors and awards==
Garfield was honored with the Award of Merit from the Association for Information Science and Technology in 1975.

He was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1984, the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal in 1984, and the Miles Conrad Award in 1985. He was also awarded the Richard J. Bolte Sr. Award in 2007. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society that same year. 

The Association for Library and Information Science Education has a fund for doctoral research through an award named after Garfield.

==Criticism==
Writing in &quot;Physiology News&quot;, No. 69, Winter 2007, David Colquhoun of the Department of Pharmacology, University College London, described the &quot;impact factor,&quot; a method for comparing scholarly journals, as &quot;the invention of Eugene Garfield, a man who has done enormous harm to true science.&quot; Colquhoun ridiculed C. Hoeffel&#x27;s assertion that Garfield&#x27;s impact factor &quot;has the advantage of already being in existence and is, therefore, a good technique for scientific evaluation&quot; by saying, &quot;you can&#x27;t get much dumber than that. It is a &#x27;good technique&#x27; because it is already in existence? There is something better. Read the papers.&quot;

==Personal life==
Garfield is survived by a wife, three sons, a daughter, two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren.

<doc id="1283238" wikidata="Q1209679" url="?curid=1283238" title="Line A (Buenos Aires Underground)">
<text>Line A is the oldest line of the Buenos Aires Underground. Opened to the public on 1 December 1913, it was the first underground line in South America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Spanish-speaking world. It made Buenos Aires the 13th city in the world to have an underground transport service. The line stretches from Plaza de Mayo and San Pedrito and runs under the full length of the Avenida de Mayo and part of the Avenida Rivadavia, and is used by 258,000 people per day.

On the first day of public service (18 December 1913), it carried 220,000 passengers. Line A used the cars used at its inauguration for just under a century. These cars were built by Belgian company La Brugeoise starting in 1913 and were refurbished in 1927 when their wooden structure was modified for underground-only use.

A peculiarity of the original &quot;pantograph&quot; cars on the &quot;underground tramway&quot; was that until 1926 they had both low doors at the ends for boarding from the street and high doors in the middle for loading from platforms in the tunnel. For this reason, Line A might also be considered the continent&#x27;s first &quot;light rail subway&quot;. The old wooden cars were removed in 2013, and replaced by modern cars.

The line has been extended twice since the completion of the original line in 1914, with the most recent two-station extension of San José de Flores and San Pedrito entering service on 27 September 2013.

== History ==


During the first decade of the 20th century in Buenos Aires, road traffic had sharply increased due to a growing population. In 1903 the city had 895,381 inhabitants and there were 4,791 horse-drawn carriages and 60 cars, while by 1913 there were 1,457,885 people, with 6,211 carriages and 7,438 automobiles.

Because it was necessary to create new forms of mass transit, in 1909 the Congress awarded Ferrocarril del Oeste (FCO) (Buenos Aires Western Railway) a concession to build a two-way underground railway that would join the main route of the Buenos Aires Western Railway (currently the Sarmiento Railway) at Once railway station, near Sadi Carnot Street (now Mario Bravo) with the port. However, on 28 December 1909 the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires gave a concession to the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company (AATC), which operated 80% of Buenos Aires&#x27; tram system at the time (making it perhaps the largest in the world) to build an underground passenger rail service.

After a dispute, it was agreed that the Western Railway would use the line for freight, but only on one track in a manner that would allow the passage of the AATC passenger line. Thus, construction of the Anglo-Argentine Line began on 15 September 1911, with the German company Philipp Holzmann &amp; Cia as contractor. The construction of this line involved hiring 1,500 workers and used 31 million bricks, 108,000 bags of cement, of iron braces, and of insulating material. The total investment to build the line was m$n17 million. m$n 3 million was invested in the excavation of the tunnel, m$n 7 million in construction, m$n 2.5 million in the initial 50 trains and m$n 2 million for the Polvorín Workshop.
The Plaza de Mayo-Plaza Miserere section was inaugurated on 1 December 1913. On the following day it opened to the public, carrying 220,000 passengers. It was the first underground railway in South America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Spanish speaking world. Buenos Aires thus became the 13th city in the world to have an underground railway, behind London, Athens, Istanbul, Vienna, Budapest, Glasgow, Paris, Boston, Berlin, New York, Philadelphia, and Hamburg. Each station was in length and had friezes of specific colours for easy identification.

The construction of the Plaza Miserere station was carried out by two companies, AACT and FCO. At that time the station had two tracks for the railway in the middle, and two pairs of lines for the underground, which were on the laterals. The outside southern track of the subway was eliminated in 1926 and it was decided to extend the platform to make the rail-underground transfer more convenient.

The route was extended to Río de Janeiro Station on 1 April 1914 and on 14 July of that year to Caballito, renamed Primera Junta station in 1923. Beyond Primera Junta a ramp was built in 1915 in the centre of Rivadavia Avenue between Cachimayo and Emilio Mitre streets, for trains to access the Polvorín Workshop on Emilio Mitre and José Bonifacio streets, covering a surface loop shared with tram traffic until 1963. This route has been used since 1980 by the Asociación Amigos del Tranvía (Association of Friends of the Tram) to run the Buenos Aires Historical Tramway. The ramp had originally taken passengers to the surface at the intersection of Lacarra and Rivadavia Avenues where trains continued to run at street level, a service that ceased on 31 December 1926.

===Recent developments===

In 1997 the Plaza Miserere station was declared a national historic monument. Over the years, most stations on the line have also been declared part of the national patrimony of Argentina and are thus protected. Unlike other lines, the original stations preserve much of their original appearance and many stations have also been restored or feature exhibits which show the history of the line.

In the first expansion of the line since 1914, Puán and Carabobo stations were opened in December 2008. As part of the opening ceremony for the two stations, Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri drove one of the La Brugeoise trains. Later in September 2013, the San José de Flores and San Pedrito stations were opened, bringing the length of the line up to and the total number of stations to 18, while adding an additional 35,000 passengers per day to the line. That same year, the line was also converted from 1100 volts to 1500 volts to match the rest of the network.

== Rolling stock ==

===1913–2013===


While the line was under construction, the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company took bids from two companies to provide the rolling stock for the line: the Belgian company La Brugeoise et Nicaise et Delcuve and the British United Electric Car Company. The tram models presented by the respective companies were the La Brugeoise cars and the UEC Preston cars.

The latter was noted for its extravagant interior design, featuring exotic materials and UEC sent four of these trams to Buenos Aires for the AATC&#x27;s consideration. Ultimately, the company chose to go with the Belgian trams and 125 of them were built to serve the line, although the four Preston trams were also kept to serve on the line. In 1927, the trams were converted to underground cars following the line&#x27;s extension underground and abandonment of its overground segment.

The UEC Preston cars ended service in 1977 and the three remaining cars are today used on the Buenos Aires Heritage Tramway and also for special occasions on Line A of the underground, such as during its 100-year anniversary. The Brugeoise cars remained in service until 2013, though numerous attempts over the years were made to either modernise the fleet (as was done with a few cars modernised by the Emepa Group in the 1980s) or replace the rolling stock completely. One such attempt to replace the rolling stock was with the purchase of 96 Alstom Metropolis cars in 2001, however these were ultimately assigned to Line D instead of Line A.

After 96 years of continuous service, the La Brugeoise cars were nearing their final withdrawal from service in 2009. Spare parts for these trains were no longer available on the market so they had to be custom-made by request at Polvorín Workshop, where La Brugeoise units and other Buenos Aires Underground rolling stock were maintained and repaired by highly skilled and qualified personnel. At this point, it was already being discussed that these surviving vintage cars could continue operating as a tourist attraction on holidays and Sundays.

According to Metrovías, the Buenos Aires Underground private operator, the La Brugeoise cars underwent a routine check-up every 20 days, while every four years heavy maintenance was performed. Despite their many years of uninterrupted service, La Brugeoise trains had one of the lowest mechanical failure averages in the network: 19 every 100,000 km.

===2013–present===

By 2013, after nearly 100 years of continuous service, the Brugeoise cars were definitively withdrawn from service on January 12, 2013, 11 months before their 100th anniversary. They were replaced by new CNR rolling stock, which has been slowly introduced as units arrive from China. The original rolling stock has since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500 V to run tourist services on the line. In December 2013 a law was passed which meant that the entire La Brugeoise fleet would receive protection status and would thus only be donated to organisations dedicated to their restoration and preservation.

The 45 200 Series CNR cars which arrived in 2013 were not sufficient to cover the entire fleet of the line, so it had to be supplemented by a temporary fleet of 35 Fiat-Materfer cars, which was still not enough to replace the 120 La Brugeoise units. Some additional refurbished Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel trains were added to the temporary fleet in addition to the Materfer trains. However, the replacement of the rolling stock coincided with the opening of the San José de Flores and San Pedrito stations, so the line was still left with insufficient rolling stock causing a decline in passenger numbers.

In the meantime, a further 105 200 Series cars were ordered from China so that the line would be served in its entirety by 150 of these cars. This mean that the Siemens O&amp;K cars could be completely retired from service and the Materfer cars moved to Line E in time for its extension to Retiro. These cars steadily arrived in Argentina from 2015 and were incorporated into the line in order to deal with the declines in frequency and passenger numbers since the retirement of the La Brugeoise cars. The last of the CNR units arrived during 2016 and 2017, by which time Line A&#x27;s rolling stock consisted entirely of the 200 Series.

==Ghost stations==
Two ghost stations exist on the line. These are Alberti Norte and Pasco Sur, which were closed in 1953. Both these stations had a single platform which allowed boarding trains only towards a single direction, while their opposite platforms (located close to each of the ghost stations) remain open as Alberti and Pasco.

<doc id="1283240" wikidata="Q4168092" url="?curid=1283240" title="Culvert">
<text>A culvert is a structure that channels water past an obstacle or to a subterranean waterway. Typically embedded so as to be surrounded by soil, a culvert may be made from a pipe, reinforced concrete or other material. In the United Kingdom, the word can also be used for a longer artificially buried watercourse.

Culverts are commonly used both as cross-drains to relieve drainage of ditches at the roadside, and to pass water under a road at natural drainage and stream crossings. When they are found beneath roads, they are frequently empty. A culvert may also be a bridge-like structure designed to allow vehicle or pedestrian traffic to cross over the waterway while allowing adequate passage for the water. Dry culverts are used to channel a fire hose beneath a noise barrier for the ease of firefighting along a highway without the need or danger of placing hydrants along the roadway itself.

Culverts come in many sizes and shapes including round, elliptical, flat-bottomed, open-bottomed, pear-shaped, and box-like constructions. The culvert type and shape selection is based on a number of factors including requirements for hydraulic performance, limitations on upstream water surface elevation, and roadway embankment height.

The process of removing culverts to restore an open-air watercourse is known as daylighting. In the UK, the practice is also known as deculverting.

==Materials==
Culverts can be constructed of a variety of materials including cast-in-place or precast concrete (reinforced or non-reinforced), galvanized steel, aluminum, or plastic (typically high-density polyethylene). Two or more materials may be combined to form composite structures. For example, open-bottom corrugated steel structures are often built on concrete footings.

==Design and engineering==
Construction or installation at a culvert site generally results in disturbance of the site&#x27;s soil, stream banks, or stream bed, and can result in the occurrence of unwanted problems such as scour holes or slumping of banks adjacent to the culvert structure.

Culverts must be properly sized and installed, and protected from erosion and scour. Many US agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration, Bureau of Land Management, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as state or local authorities, require that culverts be designed and engineered to meet specific federal, state, or local regulations and guidelines to ensure proper function and to protect against culvert failures.

Culverts are classified by standards for their load capacities, water flow capacities, life spans, and installation requirements for bedding and backfill. Most agencies adhere to these standards when designing, engineering, and specifying culverts.

==Failures==
Culvert failures can occur for a wide variety of reasons including maintenance, environmental, and installation-related failures, functional or process failures related to capacity and volume causing the erosion of the soil around or under them, and structural or material failures that cause culverts to fail due to collapse or corrosion of the materials from which they are made.

If the failure is sudden and catastrophic, it can result in injury or loss of life. Sudden road collapses are often the result of poorly designed and engineered culvert crossing sites or unexpected changes in the surrounding environment cause design parameters to be exceeded. Water passing through undersized culverts will scour away the surrounding soil over time. This can cause a sudden failure during medium-sized rain events. Accidents from culvert failure can also occur if a culvert has not been adequately sized and a flood event overwhelms the culvert, or disrupts the road or railway above it.

Ongoing culvert function without failure depends on proper design and engineering considerations being given to load, hydraulic flow, surrounding soil analysis, backfill and bedding compaction, and erosion protection. Improperly designed backfill support around culverts can result in material collapse or failure from inadequate load support.

For existing culverts which have experienced degradation, loss of structural integrity or need to meet new codes or standards, rehabilitation using a reline pipe may be preferred versus replacement. Sizing of a reline culvert uses the same hydraulic flow design criteria as that of a new culvert however as the reline culvert is meant to be inserted into an existing culvert or host pipe, reline installation requires the grouting of the annular space between the host pipe and the surface of reline pipe (typically using a low compression strength grout) so as to prevent or reduce seepage and soil migration. Grouting also serves as a means in establishing a structural connection between the liner, host pipe and soil. Depending on the size and annular space to be filled as well as the pipe elevation between the inlet and outlet, it may be necessary to add grout in multiple stages or &quot;lifts&quot;. If multiple lifts are required, then a grouting plan is required, which should define the placement of grout feed tubes, air tubes, type of grout to be used, and if injecting or pumping grout, then the required developed pressure for injection. As the diameter of the reline pipe will be smaller than the host pipe, the cross-sectional flow area will be smaller. By selecting a reline pipe with a very smooth internal surface with an approximate Hazen-Williams Friction Factor &quot;C&quot; value of between 140–150, the decreased flow area can be offset, and hydraulic flow rates potentially increased by way of reduced surface flow resistance. Examples of pipe materials with high C-factors are high-density polyethylene (150) and polyvinyl chloride (140).

==Environmental impacts==
Safe and stable stream crossings can accommodate wildlife and protect stream health, while reducing expensive erosion and structural damage. Undersized and poorly placed culverts can cause problems for water quality and aquatic organisms. Poorly designed culverts can degrade water quality via scour and erosion, as well as restrict the movement of aquatic organisms between upstream and downstream habitat. Fish are a common victim in the loss of habitat due to poorly designed crossing structures.

Culverts that offer adequate aquatic organism passage reduce impediments to movement of fish, wildlife, and other aquatic life that require instream passage. Poorly designed culverts are also more apt to become jammed with sediment and debris during medium to large scale rain events. If the culvert cannot pass the water volume in the stream, then the water may overflow the road embankment. This may cause significant erosion, ultimately washing out the culvert. The embankment material that is washed away can clog other structures downstream, causing them to fail as well. It can also damage crops and property. A properly sized structure and hard bank armoring can help to alleviate this pressure.

Culvert style replacement is a widespread practice in stream restoration. Long-term benefits of this practice include reduced risk of catastrophic failure and improved fish passage. If best management practices are followed, short-term impacts on the aquatic biology are minimal.

==Fish passage==

While the culvert discharge capacity derives from hydrological and hydraulic engineering considerations, this results often in large velocities in the barrel, creating a possible fish passage barrier. Critical culvert parameters in terms of fish passage are the dimensions of the barrel, particularly its length, cross-sectional shape, and invert slope. The behavioural response by fish species to culvert dimensions, light conditions, and flow turbulence may play a role in their swimming ability and culvert passage rate. There is no simple technical means to ascertain the turbulence characteristics most relevant to fish passage in culverts, but it is understood that the flow turbulence plays a key role in fish behaviour.

The interactions between swimming fish and vortical structures involve a broad range of relevant length and time scales. Recent discussions emphasised the role of secondary flow motion, considerations of fish dimensions in relation to the spectrum of turbulence scales, and the beneficial role of turbulent structures provided that fish are able to exploit them.

The current literature on culvert fish passage focuses mostly on fast-swimming fish species, but a few studies have argued for better guidelines for small-bodied fish including juveniles. Finally, a solid understanding of turbulence typology is a basic requirement to any successful hydraulic structure design conducive of upstream fish passage.

In the coastal plains of Queensland, Australia, torrential rains during the wet season place a heavy demand on culverts. The natural slope of the flood plains is often very small, and little fall (or head loss) is permissible in the culverts. Researchers developed and patented the design procedure of minimum energy loss culverts which yield small afflux.

A minimum energy loss culvert or waterway is a structure designed with the concept of minimum head loss. The flow in the approach channel is contracted through a streamlined inlet into the barrel where the channel width is minimum, and then it is expanded in a streamlined outlet before being finally released into the downstream natural channel. Both the inlet and the outlet must be streamlined to avoid significant form losses. The barrel invert is often lowered to increase the discharge capacity.

The concept of minimum energy loss culverts was developed by a shire engineer in Victoria and a professor at the University of Queensland during the late 1960s. While a number of small-size structures were designed and built in Victoria, some major structures were designed, tested and built in south-east Queensland.

<doc id="1283247" wikidata="Q1157061" url="?curid=1283247" title="Line B (Buenos Aires Underground)">
<text>Line B of the Buenos Aires Underground runs from Leandro N. Alem to Juan Manuel de Rosas in Villa Urquiza. Line B opened to the public on 17 October 1930.

In recent years, it has held the title of being the most used line of the Buenos Aires Underground, and its patronage has increased even more after the opening of a section of tunnel between Los Incas station in the neighbourhood of Parque Chas and a shopping centre in Villa Urquiza. It was the first line in Buenos Aires whose stations had turnstiles and moving stairways.

It is the only line that uses third rail current collection, while the rest of the Underground lines collect electric current from overhead lines, although there has been ongoing conversion to overhead lines to incorporate new rolling stock. Its gauge of is the same as the rest of the Buenos Aires underground system.

The rolling stock currently used on the B line are former Tokyo Metro (formerly Eidan Subway) 300/500/900 stock, which was used on Marunouchi Line, and CAF 5000 stock. The Japanese units were acquired in the early 1990s, and offer less sitting room than the previous rolling stock, increasing the line&#x27;s capacity during peak hours. The Japanese trains are being phased out and replaced by newer CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 rolling stock acquired from the Madrid Metro.

== History ==
In 1912 the Congress of Argentina enacted Law 8,870 to construct a line that would unite the Correo Central (Central Post Office) and the intersection of Triunvirato and Elcano streets, and meet with the tracks of the Buenos Aires Central Railroad (Ferrocarril Central de Buenos Aires or FCCBA), which belonged to the same business group, through an tunnel. The Act provided that the works &quot;would help reduce traffic in the central area of the city&quot;.

On 17 December 1927 in New York City the financial agreement to build the line was signed between Teófilo Lacroze, the president of Banco de la Nación Dr. Tomás de Estrada, Dr. Louis J. Rocca directory owner of Ferrocarril Terminal de Buenos Aires and bankers Harris and Forbes. This agreement granted the concession of the line for passengers, parcels and freight to Lacroze Brothers Company.

The construction was carried out by the Argentine builder Dwight P. Robinson &amp; Cía, and the line was called Ferrocarril Terminal Central de Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Central Terminal Railroad). The first section between Federico Lacroze and Callao opened on 17 October 1930 and was in length. The Argentine President, José Félix Uriburu, travelled on the maiden journey.

On 22 June 1931, Line B was extended to Carlos Pellegrini station. The line was finally completed on 1 December 1931 when the subway reached the Leandro N. Alem station. These three sections were located below Corrientes Avenue, including 19 curves and 13 stations.

Depending to the depth of the line, some sections were constructed using an open trench (cut-and-cover method) or gallery or tunnel. The open trench approach was used in constructing the Federico Lacroze, Dorrego, Canning (now Malabia), Río de Janeiro (now Ángel Gallardo) and Medrano stations. The tunnel at Maipu Street reached a maximum depth of . Underneath the Rancagua (today Los Andes) park in Chacarita, a workshop and a 10 track garage (with capacity for 110 cars) were built.

Lione B had escalators and turnstiles for the payment of coin-operated service, initially manufactured in the United States, formerly controlled by guards. Line B is deeper underground than Line A, and like it, each station was decorated with friezes of characteristic colours.

An underground link with the Mercado Central de Abasto (a wholesale fruit and vegetable market) was opened on 12 July 1933, through which goods wagons with freight from the Ferrocarril Central de Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Central Railroad) would arrive, driven by electric locomotives. This service ceased after a fire occurred on the link on 27 November 1952.

The line always had an automatic light signalling system. In 1980 the mechanical stop-gear devices were replaced by magnetic induction devices, and in 1998 they were finally replaced by an electronic system with Automatic Train Protection (ATP). The original tracks were replaced, and a new automatic signal system with automatic train protection was installed and the transformers were changed to ones that did not contain PCBs, a carcinogenic chemical.

The modernisation carried out from 1996 by the private concessionaire Metrovías brought about a radical change in the appearance of the stations, covering the walls of both the platforms and the halls with asphalt-type material painted black and ochre in most cases, except for Callao and Carlos Gardel which were decorated with white tiles with black veins.  As a result, the previous coloured friezes that embellished the stations and gave them their characteristic touch were covered.

On 9 August 9, 2003, two new stations, Tronador - Villa Ortúzar and De los Incas - Parque Chas, were inaugurated, allowing the line to transport more than 300,000 passengers per business day.

==Recent expansion and refurbishment==

In 2013 Line B was extended underground further west () from Los Incas/Parque Chas to Echeverría and Juan Manuel de Rosas (previously named Villa Urquiza) where transfer to the Ferrocarril Mitre line was provided. The new stations opened on 26 July 2013.

Further plans include: installation of a new signal system, acquisition of new cars, construction of a new central workshop for the repair of machinery, widening of platforms, hallways and all areas of pedestrian traffic at stations and at transfer nodes, improvements in transfer centres with other means of transport.

Some refurbishment on the line has come under criticism, mostly due to the overwhelming colour of the new murals, but also due to alleged cases where the historic artwork of the line has been destroyed during the line&#x27;s modernisation.

==Rolling stock==

Initially, the Line B had 56 English Metropolitan Cammell cars, with metal bodywork and two bogies, painted cream and red and with a capacity of 47 seated people. Each car had 3 double-leaf sliding doors on each side, at platform height, whose opening and closing was controlled by the guard, and had two 105 HP motors. Then 20 North American Osgood-Bradley cars were added. Between 1965 and 1967, 14 similar cars were purchased from Fabricaciones Militares, and between 1977 and 1979, 20 units with 195 HP Siemens engines.

In 1995, the replacement of the existing fleet began and in 1996 128 second-hand Japanese Tokyo Metro (formerly Eidan Subway) 300/400/500/900 rail cars were purchased that were in excellent condition.

In 2009, it was announced that the Madrid Metro has sold its oldest wide-profile trains to Buenos Aires. The 5000 series trains, which were in operation in Madrid since 1974, entered service in 2011 to replace some of the Eidan 300/400/500/900 sets that were utilized on line B starting in 1996.

In July 2013, Madrid Metro sold 73 of its 6000 series cars (which entered service in Madrid in 1998) to Buenos Aires for €32.6 million in exchange for the retirement of the rest of the Japanese-built trains. The purchase of the CAF 6000 rolling stock was met with major criticism due to the need for large and expensive alterations to accommodate the new rolling stock that was poorly adapted for Line B.

Due to the 6000 series cars using overhead lines for power collection, in contrast to the existing and functional third rail electrification system of Line B, a new solid overhead catenary system had to be installed. The new overhead power collection system turned out be insufficient in powering the 6000 series cars resulting in the cars operating at reduced performance leading to lower acceleration. The trains were significantly narrower than the Line B&#x27;s original loading gauge necessitating the need for modifications to the trains to reduce the large platform gap. These alterations made the second-hand units not any cheaper than simply purchasing new rolling stock, as was done with the 200 Series on Line A. The rolling stock suburban interior design was a poor fit for the urban Line B. The seating was arranged as transverse seating, designed for long distance comfort with limited standing room which is a poor fit to Line B&#x27;s typically short passenger trips with high passenger turnover at each station. The trains also were not completely walk through train sets as they were organised into married pairs. These factors and the narrow width of the train cars themselves led to very poor internal passenger circulation. The shorter cars meant that a 6000 series six car train made poor use of the existing platform length compared to older six car trains. These factors led to the new 6000 series rolling stock having a much smaller passenger capacity compared to the existing rolling stock.

As of 2020, the remaining Eidan 300/400/500/900 sets are the oldest rapid transit cars that remain in operation in the world; the remaining cars are expected to be retired in the mid-2020s.

==Events and highlights==
* When excavation was carried out for construction of the Leandro Alem station, the remains of a Mammoth of the Quaternary period where found, which were sent to the Museum of Natural Sciences of La Plata.
* Line B connects through a ramp at Federico Lacroze into the electrified track of the Urquiza Line, where the underground rolling stock heads to the Urquiza Railway workshops in Ruben Darío (Hurlingham) for wheel, gear and axle maintenance.
*Florida and Carlos Pellegrini stations are the two busiest stations on the line, as most commuters alight there in the morning to work in the downtown financial district. They also provide easy access to the entertainment district in the evening (&quot;see also&quot; Florida Street).
*Carlos Pellegrini station can be reached from an underground commercial gallery located right below the Obelisco landmark, used by pedestrians to avoid crossing 9 de Julio Avenue at street level.
*Since the 1940s, the line used to end in Federico Lacroze Station, near Chacarita Cemetery, where commuters could board the suburban bound Urquiza Line. In the 1990s, work began to expand the line to Villa Ortúzar and Villa Urquiza.

<text>The Citizen Left Party of Chile (, IC), known until 2013 as Christian Left Party of Chile (, same acronym) was a Chilean left-wing political party. Founded in 1971, in its early days it was suppressed by the Pinochet dictatorship. It was part of the Nueva Mayoría coalition, supporting the presidential candidacy president Michelle Bachelet in 2013.

== History ==
The Christian Left Party was founded when a number of Christian Democrats left their party in protest against the party&#x27;s cooperation with the right-wing forces and confrontation with the Allende government. Thus, on 31 July 1971, Bosco Parra declared that he saw no future for Christian left positions within the Christian Democrat party. He was joined by six other MPs, Fernando Buzeta, Jaime Concha, Alberto Jaramillo, Luís Maira, Pedro Urra and Pedro Videla, as well as by Silvia Alvarez, the only woman and Luís Badilla, the leader of the Christian Democratic youth organization. At this stage, the new organization was joined by a number of MAPU militants (incl. 3 senators: Julio Silva Solar, Alberto Jerez Horta and Jacques Chonchol) who were dissatisfied with their party&#x27;s affiliation with Marxism-Leninism.

Christian Left was part of the Unidad Popular coalition, and declared itself to be a revolutionary party of Christian and Humanist tradition, and in favour of constructing socialism. It tended to agree with the radical wing of the Unidad Popular (the leftist majority of the Socialist Party and parts of the MAPU). After the 1973 coup, the party members were subject to arrest and torture, like people from other leftist groups. The party&#x27;s militants continued operating together with and within left-wing groups. After democracy was restored in Chile in 1990, most of the militants joined the Socialist Party while others continued as the Christian Left party.

According to one study

‘The Christian Left assigned itself as its main task: to contribute to the construction of socialism in Chile. At the same level of importance was the defense of the compatibility between Christianity and socialism. Its position towards the capitalist regime was radical. Its purpose was to replace it as a whole and at its roots. To achieve this objective, &quot;understood as popular liberation, two processes had to be combined. 1) The definitive overcoming of the capitalist structure and 2) the progressive transfer of the authorities to the bases responsible for productive activity and the generation of goods and services. The above, the CI maintained, also implied a cultural change, in the values, behaviors and habits of the people&quot;.’

In 2003, IC became a member of the political alliance &quot;Together We Can Do More&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Juntos Podemos Más&quot;), together with the Communist Party of Chile and the Humanist Party. Their joint presidential candidate in 2005 was Tomás Hirsch of the Humanist Party. The second national congress of the Christian Left took place in 2006. The activists chose Manuel Jacques as the president of the Party.

On 3 October 2007, it started a process to re-enter the Political Party Registry (Spanish: Registro de Partidos Políticos), from which it was removed in 1989, for not having obtained enough votes to continue as a legal party. The process ended successfully on 25 May 2008, when the Electoral Service (&quot;Servicio Electoral&quot;) of Chile re-registered it as a legal political party.

In 2012 formed a party with other political leftist movements called Citizen Left. On the eve of the 2013 presidential election, the Citizen Left joined the opposition pact Nueva Mayoría and supported the presidential candidacy of Michelle Bachelet, formalizing its existence to change the legal name of the Christian Left in the Electoral Service. In 2018, Citizen Left merged with MAS Region to become MAS Citizen Left.

== Presidential candidates ==

<text>Line C of the Buenos Aires Underground, that runs from Retiro to Constitución terminus, opened on 9 November 1934, and it has a length of . It runs under Lima Sur, Bernardo de Irigoyen, Carlos Pellegrini, Esmeralda, la Plaza San Martín and Avenida Ramos Mejia streets. It not only connects to every other line on the system (with the exception of Line H, which it is planned will be connected at a later date), but its termini at Retiro and Constitución also connect it to some of the most important commuter rail networks in Buenos Aires, such as the Mitre and Roca lines and also long-distance passenger services. It is thus an important artery in Buenos Aires&#x27; transport system. At the same time, it is also the shortest line in both terms of length and number of stations.

It was the third line of the network to provide rail services to the public, after Line A and Line B. Up until 2007 with the opening of line H, it was the only line in the system providing a north–south service.

==History==
The line was constructed by the Compañía Hispano Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF, Hispanic-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances), headed by a Spanish nobleman, Rafael Benjumea, the Count of Guadalhorce. This company took on the task because the Great Depression of the 1930s meant that the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company (which owned most of the then vast tram network in the city) pulled out of its construction. The line was subsequently opened in 1934 and extended from the present terminus at Constitución to Diagonal Norte in the centre of the city. The stretch from Diagonal Norte to its present terminus at Retiro was opened in 1936 and marked the last expansion of the line, which remains the only line not to be extended since then.

On opening, the stations were decorated with murals depicting rural Spain created by Argentine artists Martín S. Noel and Manuel Escasani, as well as some stations reflecting Moorish influences and were painted with gold powder. It had advanced technology for the time, such as Automatic Train Stop (ATS).

When Line E was opened in 1938, its original terminus was shared with that of Line C at Constitución. However, Line Es&#x27; route was altered in 1966 for the lines to meet instead at Independencia, where they still do so to this day. With the extensions of Line E and Line H, they now meet Line C at Retiro, where all three terminate.

Siemens has modernised the signalling systems on the line, at a cost of $18 million which included the use of Communications-based train control (CBTC) in order to improve the line&#x27;s frequency and potentially open up the possibility of automatic trains in the future. The work was completed towards the end of 2016.

Aside from the signalling system, the line has had its stations refurbished, its rolling stock refurbished and ventilation improved, in part to compensate from the extra heat associated with the air conditioning units added to the trains. Major works took place at Constitución railway station to provide better transfers between the Roca Line, Line C and Metrobus Sur in the area, which includes the construction of a new underground annex to the station. Large segments of track, as well as switches, were replaced.

==Rolling stock==

When the line was first opened, it was served by Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel rolling stock in its entirety until 2007. In 1999, trains were purchased from the Nagoya Municipal Subway but they ultimately ended up being used on Line D, and were then sent to Line C in 2007 as Line D acquired more new Alstom rolling stock and Line H was opened, meaning that the Siemens O&amp;K trains were needed there as temporary stock until newer Alstom Metropolis trains arrived there.

In 2015, refurbished Nagoya Municipal Subway 5000 series rolling stock began to arrive, adding 50% capacity to the line&#x27;s existing Nagoya trains and reducing journey times. Though the rolling stock was in very good condition and was further refurbished, the purchase was criticised by the Minister of the Interior and Transport, Florencio Randazzo, who accused the Municipal Government of buying dated rolling stock in contrast to the brand new rolling stock purchased by the Ministry for Buenos Aires&#x27; commuter rail network and Line A of the underground. Along with the purchase, the existing Nagoya rolling stock was refurbished with air conditioning. 200 Series trains were gradually introduced to the line beginning in 2018, slowly replacing the Nagoya 250/300/700/1200 series cars until the final set was retired in 2020.

<text>Line D of the Buenos Aires Underground runs from Catedral to Congreso de Tucumán. The line opened on 3 June 1937 and has been expanded to the north several times. The line is currently 11 km long and has 16 stations, while running approximately parallel to the city&#x27;s coastline.

==History==

Line D was the second line to be built by the Compañía Hispano Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF, Hispanic-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances), following the construction of Line C in 1934. Construction began in 1935 and the first part of the line was inaugurated in 1937 and ran 1.7 km from Catedral (still the current terminus) to Tribunales. Three years later, the section which brought the line to Plaza Italia in Palermo was completed, bringing the length of the line to 6.5 km.

The line was not properly extended until 1993 when it was extended to Ministro Caranza, a station named after the Radical politician. Further extensions occurred in the 1990s, beginning in 1997 with the opening of Olleros and José Hernández, then Juramento in 1999, and finally Congreso de Tucumán in 2000, where it currently terminates.

Over the decades it has been discussed numerous times whether to extend the line out to the limits of the city proper. The last of these proposals came forward in 2002 which would have seen an additional two stations added to the line. However, this was later abandoned since the line was already at full capacity after the opening of Congreso de Tucumán station. In June 2015 the Metrobus Cabildo line opened, connecting Line D from its terminus at Congreso de Tucumán to Vicente López district in Greater Buenos Aires, some kilometres away from the city limits, overlapping any theoretical extension of Line D. Line D is the only line in the network which will not be extended as part of the most recent expansion plan.

The line was closed for two months during the summer of 2024 to upgrade the signal system. However, after the update, the frequency was actually worse and the waiting time ceased to be shown on the stations.

Until the privatisation of the underground in the 1990s, Line D was identified by the red colour; whilst Line B used green.

==Museum Stations==
Cultural activities occur at the Line D Juramento, Congreso de Tucumán and Olleros stations. These stations can be visited to see the exhibitions provided by the city&#x27;s and national museums, education institutions and other civil society organisations.

“The objective of the museum-stations is to get the population acquainted with the huge cultural and historical patrimony that the City owns, thus turning the subway network, a massive transport medium, into an ideal diffusion agent. The lending of the facilities is absolutely free for the museum and institutions that wish to exhibit their activities or part of the historical or cultural patrimony they treasure”.

==Rolling stock==

Line D was originally served by Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel rail rolling stock, and then by CAF cars. In 1999, cars from the Nagoya Municipal Subway were purchased second hand from Japan and used on the line. In 2001, numerous Alstom Metropolis 100 Series cars were purchased and built in Brazil and Argentina with the intention of incorporating them into Line A, however they were ultimately put into service on Line D. More 100 Series cars were purchased up until 2009, making a total of 96 cars. Since 2019, much of the fleet was transferred to Line E to serve alongside the Fiat Materfer cars on that line. The Alstom 100 fleet has been suspended on Line D since the 2024 January-March shutdown, as they do not yet have the capability to operate under CBTC signalling. 

The remaining Nagoya cars were moved to Line C in 2007 and replaced with the 100 Series cars and with Fiat-Materfer cars. To make the rolling stock more uniform, 24 more modern 300 Series Alstom Metropolis cars were ordered in 2013 to replace the Materfer cars on the line, which meant that the line was entirely composed of 120 Alstom cars. In September 2015, at a conference in Brazil, the head of SBASE gave a presentation in which the number of new cars to be purchased for the line was 84 instead of 30. By 2016, the final figure had been fixed at 60 new cars, which meant that the line had 156 Alstom Metropolis cars by 2017. The 300 Series cars now make up the entirety of Line D&#x27;s fleet.

<doc id="1283269" wikidata="Q15998141" url="?curid=1283269" title="Death of Mary Reeser">
<text>Mary Hardy Reeser (March 8, 1884 – July 2, 1951) of St. Petersburg, Florida, was a woman whose fiery death was surrounded by mystery, and even controversially reported at the time to be a case of spontaneous human combustion (SHC). She was often referred to as the &quot;cinder lady&quot; in newspaper accounts of the day. 

==Death==
At roughly 8 a.m. on July 2, 1951, Reeser&#x27;s landlady, Pansy Carpenter, arrived at Reeser&#x27;s apartment at 1200 Cherry St. NE, St. Petersburg, Florida, with a telegram. Trying the door, she found the metal doorknob to be uncomfortably warm to the touch and called the police. Reeser&#x27;s remains—that were largely ashes—were found among the remnants of a chair in which she had been sitting.

===Details===
All that remained of Reeser, who contemporaneously became known as the &quot;cinder lady,&quot; were part of her left foot (that was wearing a slipper), her backbone, and her skull. Plastic household objects at a distance from the seat of the fire were softened and had lost their shapes. Reeser&#x27;s skull had survived and was found among the ashes, but shrunken &#x27;to the size of a teacup,&#x27; a description disputed by a fire researcher who was in Bradenton for a conference at the time and managed to view the scene.

==Investigation and results==
On July 7, 1951, St. Petersburg police chief J. R. Reichert sent a box of evidence from the scene to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. He included glass fragments found in the ashes, six &quot;small objects thought to be teeth,&quot; a section of the carpet, and the surviving shoe. Reichert included a note saying: &quot;We request any information or theories that could explain how a human body could be so destroyed and the fire confined to such a small area and so little damage done to the structure of the building and the furniture in the room not even scorched or damaged by smoke.&quot;

The FBI eventually declared that Reeser had been incinerated by the wick effect. As she was a known user of sleeping pills, they hypothesized that she had fallen unconscious while smoking and set fire to her nightclothes. &quot;Once the body starts to burn,&quot; the FBI wrote in its report, &quot;there is enough fat and other inflammable substances to permit varying amounts of destruction to take place. Sometimes this destruction by burning will proceed to a degree which results in almost complete combustion of the body.&quot; 

When interviewed by a local paper, Reeser&#x27;s daughter-in-law said: &quot;the cigarette dropped to her lap. Her fat was the fuel that kept her burning. The floor was cement, and the chair was by itself. There was nothing around her to burn&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mary Reeser was born in Columbia, Pennsylvania and married Richard Reeser. Their only surviving child, also named Richard Reeser, was born in Pennsylvania in 1910. She was buried in the Chestnut Hill Cemetery outside Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Her son died in 1998 at the age of 88. He had a daughter, Mary Carole, named for her grandmother, who died in 2005. They had another daughter, Nancy, who died in 2021, and another, Martha Reeser Rice, who is still alive. Their mother died in 2008.

<doc id="1283271" wikidata="Q1132660" url="?curid=1283271" title="Line H (Buenos Aires Underground)">
<text>Line H is a line of the Buenos Aires Underground. The first phase, between Plaza Once and Caseros, which opened on 18 October 2007, currently stretches over 8.8 km between Hospitales and Facultad de Derecho stations. It is the first entirely new line built in Buenos Aires since the opening of Line E on 20 June 1944.

According to projections, the line will stretch a total of about 11.85 km and will run from between Retiro to Sáenz once the remaining sections are constructed. It connects the southern part of the city with the north, improving traffic flow to the centre of the city. It is also designed to serve as a transversal line and provide cross-connections across all radial lines, mainly under the axis of Jujuy and Pueyrredón avenues.

== Rolling stock ==
During its early years, Line H was served by a temporary fleet of refurbished and original vintage Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel train sets originally introduced on line C, with electric current supplied by overhead lines. The cars featured 42 seats and 4 doors per side.

As the line was extended and passenger numbers increased, the rolling stock was replaced by new Alsom 300 Series units ordered from that company in 2012 in order to make up the entirety of the Line&#x27;s rolling stock. The first 6 of the 120 new Alstom cars arrived In August 2015, with the remainder phased-in as the line has been extended.

==Further expansion==

An initial extension to Corrientes station was inaugurated on Monday 6 December 2010. The Córdoba and Las Heras stations opened in December 2015 with Santa Fe station (which links Line H to Line D) opening in April 2016. Alstom Metropolis rolling stock is now being used on the line.

The Facultad de Derecho station (located at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Law) was originally intended to be located across the road next to Plaza Francia, however concerns that it would damage the prestigious Recoleta Cemetery necessitated revisions to these plans and therefore delayed construction of the station, which eventually opened in May 2018. The final stretch to Retiro is not set to open until some time after the revision of the route following the relocation of the Plaza Francia station.

<doc id="1283277" wikidata="Q2509028" url="?curid=1283277" title="Explorer 7">
<text>Explorer 7 was a NASA satellite launched on 13 October 1959, at 15:30:04 GMT, by a Juno II launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) to an orbit of and inclination of 50.27°. It was designed to measure solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha flux, trapped energetic particles, and heavy primary cosmic rays. Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeoroid penetration, molecular sputtering and studying the Earth-atmosphere heat balance.

== Satellite description ==
The spin-stabilized satellite&#x27;s external structure consisted of two truncated conical fiberglass shells joined by a cylindrical aluminum center section. The spacecraft was wide at its equator and about high with a payload mass of about . The spacecraft was powered by approximately 3000 solar cells mounted on both the upper and lower shells. Additional power was provided by 15 rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries that were positioned on its equator near the outer skin as an aid in maintaining a proper spin rate. Two crossed dipole (1 W, 20-MHz) telemetry antennas projected outward from the center section, and a 108-MHz antenna used for tracking was mounted on the bottom of the lower shell.

Located around the periphery of the center section were five bolometers for thermal radiation measurements and three cadmium sulfide micrometeoroid detector cells. A cylindrical ion chamber (lithium fluoride window) and a beryllium window X-ray chamber were located on opposite sides of the upper cone, and a cosmic-ray Geiger counter was located on the very top. A primary cosmic-ray ionization chamber was located within the center portion of the upper cone. Communications and tracking were provided by a 108-MHz transmitter at 15-mW designed to operate for 2 months and a 20-MHz transmitter at 600-mW powered by the solar cells designed for cut-off after about one year.

== Experiments ==
=== Ground Based Ionospheric ===
An all-transistor beacon telemetry transmitter was operated at a fundamental frequency of 19.9915 MHz. This transmitter, which was powered by solar cells and rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, provided 660-mW of power at the fundamental frequency. It also radiated the second and third harmonics (15-mW each) at 39.9830 and 59.9745-MHz. Beacon receivers were known to have been located in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, Illinois. Interpretation of the changes of beacon signal characteristics between the satellite and the ground station showed irregularities to be present at all times of the day with horizontal dimensions of to . Data were received over a period of 16 months.

=== Heavy Primary Cosmic Rays ===
This experiment was designed to measure the omnidirectional flux of heavy primary cosmic rays in the rigidity range 1 to 15.5 GV. Particles with atomic numbers Z &gt;5, Z &gt;8, and Z &gt;15 were counted separately by an ionization chamber in which each incident particle yielded a pulse. Pulse amplitude was substantially independent of the energy of the incident particle but was proportional to the square of its Z value. Each of the three counting rates was determined every 15 seconds. The experiment performed as planned from launch until 25 October 1959. About 80% of the data acquired for the 25 October 1959, to 31 May 1960, period are useful, with most problems occurring in the lowest Z mode. Very little useful data were acquired after 31 May 1960.

=== Micrometeorite ===
Three photoconducting cadmium sulfide cells were used to measure micrometeorite penetration and molecular sputtering. The three cells were identical in design and effective area (18 sq mm) and were mounted on a magnesium plate on the satellite&#x27;s equator facing outward perpendicular to the satellite&#x27;s spin axis. The experiment was exposed to the space environment of micrometeorites, trapped radiation, and sputtering for 38 days of active life. The three cells and a thermistor that was included as part of the experiment performed normally. One cell was penetrated on the 16th day by a particle approximately 10 microns in diameter.

=== Solar X-Ray and Lyman-Alpha Radiation ===
The solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha radiation were measured by means of gas ionization chambers mounted on opposite sides of the upper portion of the double cone configuration of the Explorer 7 satellite. Intensities were monitored in order to obtain a long-term history of solar X-ray and Lyman-alpha fluxes and to correlate these with terrestrial atmospheric responses. The two X-ray detectors ( deep) were filled with argon gas and had beryllium windows (.021 g/sq cm) resulting in a sensitivity to X-rays in the 2 to 8 A range. The Lyman-alpha detectors (on the opposite side), which were circular ionization chambers ( in diameter) filled with nitric oxide gas, had lithium fluoride windows. Their sensitivity was in the 1050 to 1350 A interval. The data, however, were impossible to interpret in terms of incident solar radiation due to both the saturation of detector circuits by Van Allen radiation (150 keV electrons) and electronic difficulties in the feedback amplifier.

=== Thermal Radiation ===
The Explorer 7 thermal radiation experiment was designed to measure incident and reflected solar UV radiation and terrestrial IR radiation in order to obtain a better understanding of the driving forces of the Earth-atmosphere system. The primary instrumentation consisted of five bolometers in the form of hollow silver hemispheres that were thermally insulated from, but in close proximity to specially aluminized mirrors. The hemispheres thereby behaved very much like isolated spheres in space. Two of the hemispheres had black coatings and responded about equally to solar and terrestrial radiation. A third hemisphere, coated white, was more sensitive to terrestrial radiation than to solar radiation. A fourth, which had a gold metal surface, was more sensitive to solar radiation than to terrestrial radiation. The fifth hemisphere, protected from direct sunlight, was used to measure the reflected sunlight. A glass-coated bead thermistor was mounted on the top of each hemisphere to measure the temperature. A complete set of four temperature observations and one reference sample required 30 seconds. Thus, in each orbit, about 180 temperature measurements could be obtained. The experiment was a success, and usable data were obtained from launch until 28 February 1961.

Significantly, it also carried Dr. Verner E. Suomi&#x27;s flat-plate radiometer, improved with the help of Robert Parent, that took the first Earth radiation budget measurements from space and initiated the era of satellite studies of the climate. It made the first coarse maps of &quot;the solar radiation reflected by the Earth and the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth&quot;.

Using both satellite observations of the Earth&#x27;s heat balance and atmospheric cooling rates measured by net flux radiosondes, Suomi established the important role played by clouds in absorbing radiated solar energy. These observations established that Earth&#x27;s energy budget varies markedly due to the effect of clouds, the surface albedo, and other absorbing constituents. Using these instruments, Suomi and his team discovered that the Earth absorbed more of the Sun&#x27;s energy than originally thought and demonstrated that it was possible to measure and quantify seasonal changes in the global heat budget. Explorer 7 was unable to detect solar X-rays due to its sensors being saturated by background radiation in the Van Allen radiation belt.

=== Trapped Radiation and Solar Protons ===
Two omnidirectional Geiger counters (Anton 302 and 112) were used to conduct a comprehensive spatial and temporal monitoring of total cosmic-ray intensity, geomagnetically trapped corpuscular radiation, and solar protons. The detector was sensitive to protons (E &gt;20 MeV) and electrons (E &gt;30 keV). The experiment operated satisfactorily from launch until 28 February 1961, except for a brief period in September and October 1960.

== Launch ==
Launch was originally scheduled for late September 1959, but the mission was delayed for a week after a Jupiter IRBM test on an adjacent pad failed shortly after liftoff, causing flying debris to hit Explorer 7&#x27;s launch vehicle. However, the damage to the booster was minor and could be easily repaired.

Explorer 7 was launched on a Juno II at 15:31 GMT on 13 October 1959 from the Atlantic Missile Range into a orbit. On 16 June 1960, NASA announced one of the four frequency modulated subcarriers on the second transmitter had become erratic and the information it was transmitting on 3 of the 7 experiments was no longer intelligible. The tracking beacon ceased transmitting on 5 December 1959. As of September 1960 the orbit was with an inclination of 50.3° and a period of 101.2 minutes. Useful real-time data were transmitted from launch through February 1961 and intermittently until 24 August 1961. The spacecraft provided significant geophysical information on radiation and magnetic storms, demonstrated methods of controlling internal temperatures, recorded the first micrometeorite penetration of a sensor in flight, and detected large scale weather patterns.

== Mission results ==
It transmitted data continuously through to February 1961 and went dead on 24 August 1961. it is still in orbit.

<text>ISO 20022 is an ISO standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. It describes a metadata repository containing descriptions of messages and business processes, and a maintenance process for the repository content. The standard covers financial information transferred between financial institutions that includes payment transactions, securities trading and settlement information, credit and debit card transactions and other financial information.

The repository contains a huge amount of financial services metadata that has been shared and standardized across the industry. The metadata is stored in UML models with a special ISO 20022 UML Profile. Underlying all of this is the ISO 20022 metamodel – a model of the models. The UML profile is the metamodel transformed into UML. The metadata is transformed into the syntax of messages used in financial networks. The first syntax supported for messages was XML Schema.

ISO 20022 is widely used in financial services. Organizations participating in ISO 20022 include SWIFT. ISO 20022 is the successor to ISO 15022; originally ISO 20022 was called ISO 15022 2nd Edition. ISO 15022 was the successor of ISO 7775.

== Parts of the standard ==
ISO 20022 Financial services – Universal financial industry message scheme. 
== Management of the standard ==
* The Standard is issued by ISO Technical Committee 68 (TC68), which is responsible for Financial Services in ISO.
* The Standard is managed by Sub Committee 9 (SC 9) &quot;Information exchange for financial services&quot;.
* The Working Group 4 (WG4), a sub-group of SC 9, who works on the next revision of ISO 20022.
* The Standard defines a Registration Management Group (RMG) Composed of senior industry experts. It is the highest registration body.
* SEG Standard Evolution Group composed of industry experts in specific business domains of the financial industry
* SWIFT is the Registration Authority (RA) for ISO 20022. RA is the guardian of the ISO 20022 financial repository. The AG 1 Group oversees the performance of RA.

== Adoption ==
A 2015 report by the United States&#x27;s Federal Reserve System classified Europe having &quot;mature adopters&quot; of ISO 20022; India, South Africa, Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland as having &quot;growing adopters&quot;; and Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand as having &quot;interested adopters&quot;. The report concluded that the Federal Reserve should push for ISO 20022 adoption within the United States financial system.

Australia&#x27;s New Payments Platform, launched in February 2018, uses ISO 20022 messaging. 

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand plans to support ISO 20022 from November 2022 onward.

Nordic countries launched the P27 payment platform, but that initiative eventually failed in 2023.

The Eurosystem in March 2023 switched its real-time gross settlement to T2, which follows ISO 20022. The switch involves transactions for settling payments related to the Eurosystem&#x27;s monetary policy operations, as well as bank‑to‑bank and commercial transactions. TARGET2 previously handled transactions for over 2000 G€ per day.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Fedwire Funds Service will begin using the ISO 20022 messaging format in July 2025. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s FedNow instant payments service also uses ISO 20022 messaging. The private Clearing House Payments Company&#x27;s RTP instant payments service uses ISO 20022 messaging. Its CHIPS funds transfer service migrated to using ISO 20022 in April 2024.

<doc id="1283287" wikidata="Q7318272" url="?curid=1283287" title="Reverse tape effects">
<text>Reverse tape effects are special effects created by recording sound onto magnetic tape and then physically reversing the tape so that when the tape is played back, the sounds recorded on it are heard in reverse. Backmasking is a type of reverse tape effect.

== History ==

In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, a device allowing sound to be recorded and reproduced on a rotating cylinder with a stylus (or &quot;needle&quot;) attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. Emile Berliner invented the familiar lateral-cut disc phonograph record in 1888. In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards. In 1878, Edison noted that, when played backwards, &quot;the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way&quot;.

Reverse effects were regarded largely as a curiosity and were little used until the 1950s. The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology: the development of &quot;musique concrète&quot;, an avant-garde form of electronic music, which involves editing together fragments of natural and industrial sounds, and the concurrent spread of the use of tape recorders in recording studios. These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on tape using techniques including reverse tape effects. 

The reverse tape technique became especially popular during the psychedelic music era of the mid-to-late 1960s when musicians and producers exploited a vast range of special audio effects.

== Examples ==
One of the best-known examples of music featuring reverse tape effects is the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme (1963), composed by Ron Grainer and realised electronically by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. 

Several The Beatles songs of the period — including &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) tracks &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; — also feature recordings of electric guitars, sitars and &quot;birds&quot; which have been reversed. Another famous example of the use of reverse tape effects is their 1967 single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot; During the verses, Lennon&#x27;s voice is accompanied by a series of rapid &quot;swooshing&quot; sounds; these are actually the sounds of Ringo Starr&#x27;s drum and cymbal accompaniment. These patterns were carefully pre-recorded, the tape reversed and the reversed percussion effects meticulously edited into the master tape to synchronise with the music. 

Around the same time, Jimi Hendrix recorded backward guitar for tracks such as &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; and &quot;Castles Made of Sand,&quot; both released 1967. Stephen Stills, a close friend of Jimi Hendrix, used the effect on Graham Nash&#x27;s song &quot;Pre-Road Downs&quot; from Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&#x27;s debut album.

Occasionally, record labels would use a reverse tape song on the B-side of a single, to ensure that only the A side got radio play. One example is &quot;Noolab Wolley&quot; by the US group The Yellow Balloon; A-side “Yellow Balloon” was a big cheery harmony-drenched slice of sunshine pop that went to #25 in Billboard in the spring of 1967. The flip side of the single reversed the tape to create a surprisingly listenable off-kilter bit of shoopy drums and near-psychedelic &quot;lyrics&quot; that worked pretty well. In the year prior, there was &quot;Aaah-ah, Yawa Em Ekat Ot Gnimoc Er’yeht&quot; by Napoleon XIV (Jerry Samuels). In the original song &quot;They’re Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&quot;, Samuels created one of the most bizarre one-hit oddities of the 1960s, going to #1 in Cashbox, #3 in Billboard, #4 in the UK, and #2 in Canada in the summer of 1966. The reverse version fared reasonably well on the flip side, since the martial drumming of the A side remained more or less intact, and the lyrics were only slightly less warped.

An example of the use of reverse tape effects is the song &quot;Roundabout&quot; (1972) by the British progressive rock group Yes. The song begins with a sound which gradually fades in, and then ends suddenly, changing abruptly into guitar music, performed by guitarist Steve Howe.
The &quot;fade-in&quot; sound is a minor chord (played on a grand piano by keyboardist Rick Wakeman) that was sounded and allowed to fade to silence. The tape of this piano chord was then reversed by producer Eddy Offord and carefully edited into the track. With the fading piano sound is thus reversed, it slowly builds up in volume before ending suddenly, at which point Offord edited it seamlessly into the first notes of Howe&#x27;s guitar introduction. This distinctive effect is heard several times during the introduction and its reprise.

<text>Gimli was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1899, and existed continuously until the 2019 election. Following this, it was redistributed into the Interlake-Gimli electoral district.

Gimli was located to the immediate north of the City of Winnipeg. It was bordered to the north by Interlake, to the west by Interlake and Lakeside, and to the east by Lake Winnipeg and Selkirk.

Communities in the riding included Gimli, Winnipeg Beach, Petersfield, Clandeboye and Matlock.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,700. In 1999, the average family income was $58,790, and the unemployment rate was 7.90%. The service sector accounts for 15% of industry in the riding, with a further 11% each in manufacturing and the retail trade. There is also a significant fishing and tourism economy in the riding.

Gimli is home to the largest Icelandic community in the world outside Iceland, and many of its MLAs have been from this background. It also has significant Ukrainian and German communities, at 12% and 6% respectively.

Gimli was a &quot;bellwether&quot; riding, and has elected a candidate from a governing party in all but five elections since its establishment (the exceptions were 1907, 1920, 1922, 1936 and 1999).

<text>Line E of the Buenos Aires Underground runs from Retiro to Plaza de los Virreyes, a total distance of 12 km. Opened in 1944, the Line E was the last completely new line to be added to the Buenos Aires Underground, until 2007 when Line H was opened. The line has a history of being re-routed and extended due to having been historically the line with the lowest passenger numbers on the network.

==History==
Line E was opened on 20 June 1944, after construction began in 1938, with an original route that ran from Constitución railway station to General Urquiza. Soon after, it was decided to abandon the terminus at Constitución (which also served as the connection with Line C) and instead reroute the line towards the Plaza de Mayo.

Work began in 1957, and in 1966 the San José, Independencia, Belgrano and Plaza de Mayo (now Bolívar) stations were opened to the public by president Arturo Umberto Illia. For many years, the two stations that had been closed as a result of the Line E re-route remained unused until the mid-1990s when one was converted into a workshop to service the rolling stock of the line.

The line was further extended in 1973 to José María Moreno and then again in 1985 to Plaza de los Virreyes. The PreMetro E2 tramway was completed in 1987 and was linked to Line E with the intention of connecting a larger Premetro network to the line, although this never materialised following privatisation.

Under the private operation of the Subte by Metrovías, the colour of the line was changed from yellow to purple during the 1990s. Purple had previously been used for Line C, while yellow is now used for Line H.

===Extension to Retiro===

As part of a general effort to extend the Buenos Aires Underground, it was decided to extend Line E from Bolívar to Retiro railway station (with intermediate stations at Catalinas and Correo Central) where it would re-connect with Line C and the Mitre Line, and eventually Line H when its extension was completed. By 2014, all the major structural works had been completed on the three new stations with the tracks and signalling systems still to be completed.

In July 2015, the City of Buenos Aires confirmed that, despite the advanced state of the works, the extension would not be opened until 2019 citing delays that came about as a result of the transfer of the works from the National Government to the City Government in 2012. The city completed the additional work required by the new deadline. On Monday 3 June 2019 the extension to Retiro was completed. The extension was expected to increase ridership on the line by 25%.

==Rolling stock==
The line originally used Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel rolling stock during its inauguration and for many years after. However, this was later replaced by similar CAF-GEE rolling stock purchased in 1968 which still serves on the line today. In 2006, 64 of the CAF-GEE cars were to be refurbished, but this was ultimately abandoned.

It is expected that with the line&#x27;s extension to Retiro completed in 2019, the CAF GEE rolling stock will be retired and replaced by and possibly 50 Siemens O&amp;K cars refurbished by the Emepa Group and Alstom.

In 2019, refurbished Alstom Metropolis 100 cars began to operate on Line E, after being displaced from Line D. These units have worked alongside the Fiat-Materfer fleet since then. The Alstom 100 fleet continued to transfer to Line E until 2024, comprising the vast majority of the line&#x27;s rolling stock. Less than five Fiat-Materfer formations operate in regular service as of July 2024.

==Ghost stations==

There are two ghost stations on the line – San José vieja and Constitución. These formed part of the line&#x27;s original Line E route towards Constitución railway station until the line was re-routed in 1966. Both stations have been used as workshops and storage areas for the line&#x27;s rolling stock. It has also been evaluated using the two stations and their corresponding tunnels as the southern part of Line F since that line&#x27;s projected route in that area overlaps with the former Line E route.

San José vieja was used as a set for the 1996 Argentine film Moebius and served as the fictional &quot;Dock Sud&quot; and &quot;Parque&quot; stations.

<doc id="1283328" wikidata="Q3239112" url="?curid=1283328" title="Line G (Buenos Aires Underground)">
<text>Line G is a planned addition to the Buenos Aires Underground which has been on the drawing board in numerous forms since the 1930s. After a failed attempt at financing and building the line in 2009, its most recent proposal was put forward in 2015 by the government of Buenos Aires.

==History==
The history of Line G dates back to 1930 when the Hispano-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances (CHADOPyF) was tasked with expanding the network following the construction of Line A by the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company. The company had been tasked with building four new lines, with Line 3 running from Plaza de Mayo to the intersections of San Martín and Gaona Avenues, the current location of the Sid Campeador monument, which would be built in 1935. By 1932, the original plans had been revised twice and the number of projected lines was reduced to three, with parts of lines 3 and 4 being merged into a new Line 3 (today known as Line D), and the western section of Line 3 being left on the drawing board, later to re-emerge as the planned Line G.

===Law 670===
On 8 November 2001, the government of the City of Buenos Aires established a law outlining the future expansion of the Underground network, which included three new lines; F, G and I, as well measures for the advancement of Line H. Line G would start at Retiro Mitre railway station and then head west, terminating at the Cid Campeador monument, near Parque Centenario in the Caballito neighborhood.
The Retiro - Cid Campeador line, which was to stretch 7.3km and have 11 station, was then planned as follows:
* Retiro 
* Cerrito
* Uruguay
* Callao 
* Pueyrredón 
* Jean Juares
* Mario Bravo
* Gascón
* Estado de Israel 
* Parque Centenario
* Cid Campeador 

By December 2009, the City of Buenos Aires had made significant advances in negotiating financing and construction equipment from Exim Bank of China and China Railway Group Limited (CREC). The construction of the line was to be done with tunnel boring machines, allowing for the tunnel to advance an average of 15 metres per day and the CREC would be in charge of all aspects of construction and sourcing of materials as well as rolling stock. By early 2011, it was announced that the government had obtained financing for $1.4 billion for the line and was to begin construction in 2012, concluding in 2016. The line was to be 12.5km long and terminate further west at Villa del Parque, continuing on from the Sid Campeador terminus envisioned in Law 670. However, once the project had reached the Buenos Aires City Legislature for consideration, many aspects of the deal were questioned, including the cost of the line which was estimated to be significantly cheaper ($1 billion) if built directly by the city. Following these concerns and questions, construction was postponed indefinitely later that year. 

===PETERS Plan===

In 2015 new plans for the Underground were published by the City of Buenos Aires. As part of this new plan, Line G was re-designed completely, running through the financial district of the city in between Line F and Line C before running westwards towards Palermo, proximately parallel to and just north of Line D. It was proposed that construction on the line was to begin sometime after construction began on the proposed Line F.

<text>Michael Joseph Alstott (born December 21, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Nicknamed &quot;A-Train&quot;, he played college football for the Purdue Boilermakers and was selected by the Buccaneers in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft. Alstott received six Pro Bowl and three first-team All-Pro honors during his career, in addition to being part of the Buccaneers team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII. For his accomplishments in Tampa Bay, he was inducted to the Buccaneers Ring of Honor in 2015. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest fullbacks of all time. One of the NFL&#x27;s YouTube channels called Alstott &quot;the last legendary fullback&quot;.

==College career==
Alstott attended Purdue University for four years, where he became the first player in school history named MVP in three consecutive seasons. Alstott scored 12 touchdowns as a sophomore, 14 as a junior, and 11 as a senior, and held the Purdue rushing touchdown record with 39 until Kory Sheets broke it in 2008. He averaged 5.6 yards per attempt during his Purdue career before graduating in 1995 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business. He finished as Purdue&#x27;s all-time leading rusher with 3,635 yards, including a school-best 1,436 yards in 1995.

==Professional career==

Alstott was selected in the second round (35th overall) of the 1996 NFL draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers utilized Alstott primarily as a running fullback as opposed to a blocking fullback that teams were starting to switch to at the time. He was a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team that won Super Bowl XXXVII (2002), played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California. Alstott rushed for 15 yards and the first Super Bowl touchdown in Tampa Bay Buccaneers history. He also caught five passes for 43 yards.

Alstott signed a one-year contract to stay in Tampa Bay for the 2005 season, and signed a similar contract at the conclusion of the 2006 season after contemplating retirement. However, he spent all of the 2007 season on injured reserve because of neck problems, leading to his retirement on January 24, 2008.

In the summer of 2007, shortly before he suffered his season-ending and ultimately career-ending neck injury, Alstott appeared in a television commercial for ESPN Fantasy Football along with former teammate Warrick Dunn, who was later signed by the Falcons.

He was ranked No. 10 on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten Power Backs&quot;.

With 71 total touchdowns as a Buccaneer, Alstott broke the previous franchise record of 46 by running back James Wilder when he scored his 47th career TD on November 26, 2001. Alstott remained the Buccaneers&#x27; all-time leading touchdown scorer until November 22, 2021, when wide receiver Mike Evans scored his 72nd TD as a Buccaneer.

==Personal life==
Alstott and his ex-wife, Nicole Alstott, have three children. His son Griffin was a quarterback at Western Michigan from 2018 to 2020, after spending the 2017 season at Purdue.

<text>Caulobacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria in the class Alphaproteobacteria. Its best-known member is &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot;, an organism ubiquitous in freshwater lakes and rivers; many members of the genus are specialized to oligotrophic environments.

==Interactions with other organisms==
===Pathogenicity===
Although &quot;Caulobacter&quot; is not commonly appreciated as a cause of human diseases, &quot;Caulobacter&quot; isolates have been implicated in a number of cases of recurrent peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. One study has identified the species &quot;C. crescentus&quot; and &quot;C. mirare&quot; as the cause of a disease of the moth &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;; the absence of identified distinct virulence factors in &quot;C. mirare&quot; may suggest that other &quot;Caulobacter&quot; species have pathogenic potential.

<doc id="1283338" wikidata="Q261924" url="?curid=1283338" title="List of Florida state parks">
<text>There are 175 state parks and 9 state trails in the U.S. state of Florida which encompass more than , providing recreational opportunities for both residents and tourists.

Almost half of the state parks have an associated local 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, often styled, &quot;Friends of {&quot;park name&quot;} State Park, Inc.&quot;. 
In 2015, some 29,356 volunteers donated nearly 1.3 million hours to enhance the parks for approximately 31 million visitors. There is a mostly nominal admission to nearly all Florida&#x27;s state parks, although separate fees are charged for the use of cabins, marinas, campsites, etc. Florida&#x27;s state parks offer 3,613 family campsites, 186 cabins, thousands of picnic tables, of beaches, and over of trails.

The Florida Park Service is the division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection responsible for the operation of Florida State Parks, and won the Gold Medal honoring the best state park system in the country in 1999 and 2005 from the National Recreation and Park Association. They were also finalists in the 1997 and 2011 competitions. The Park Service was awarded the gold medal again in October 2013, making it the only three-time winner. In 2019, they received the gold medal award again, resulting in them being the first four-time winner. The parks are open year-round and offer diverse activities beyond fishing, hiking and camping. Many parks offer facilities for birding or horseback riding; there are several battle reenactments; and freshwater springs and beaches are Florida&#x27;s gems. According to the Florida Park Service website, their goal &quot;is to help create a sense of place by showing park visitors the best of Florida&#x27;s diverse natural and cultural sites. Florida&#x27;s state parks are managed and preserved for enjoyment by this and future generations through providing appropriate resource-based recreational opportunities, interpretation and education that help visitors connect to the Real Florida.&quot;

Several state parks were formerly private tourist attractions purchased by the state of Florida to preserve their natural environment. These parks include the Silver Springs State Park, Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, Rainbow Springs State Park, and Weeki Wachee Springs.
There are state parks in 58 of Florida&#x27;s 67 counties. Nine of the 175 parks do not have &quot;State Park&quot; in their name. Four are &quot;conservation areas&quot; (reserve, preserve, or wildlife refuge); three are &quot;Historical/Archaeological sites&quot;; one is a fishing pier and one is a recreation area. Seven parks are mostly undeveloped with few or no facilities; 10 parks are accessible only by private boat or ferry; and 13 parks contain National Natural Landmarks. Additionally, there are eleven national parks and service sites in Florida locations under control of the National Park Service.

Florida State Parks are supported by tax dollars (document stamps), user fees, and to a much smaller extent charitable contributions. Many state parks have an associated local non-profit corporation. Most parks charge an entrance fee. Residents can purchase an annual entrance pass that is valid at any of the parks. Camping is available in campsites in some of the parks. All reservations for park facilities are handled through the private corporation ReserveAmerica. The Florida State Parks website (floridastateparks.org) provides an updated online guide to all parks.

==Development plans by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection==
On 19 August 2024 the Florida Department of Environmental Protection announced plans to build golf courses and 350-room lodges on state park lands.

In statements to the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; and in posts to social media, the agency claimed that the construction of a golf course on vulnerable scrub habitat will be done in a way to &quot;minimize habitat impacts&quot;. A spokesperson for Governor Ron DeSantis, Jeremy Redfern, defended the plans, saying &quot;it&#x27;s high time we made public lands more accessible to the public.&quot; DeSantis, an enthusiastic golfer, controls the Department of Environmental Protection, and has increased his influence over the agency in comparison to former governors. In an unprecedented move that critics said violated state law, he unilaterally appointed its secretary without approval by other members of the Florida Cabinet.

The Tampa Bay Times also reported that US Senators Rick Scott (R) and Marco Rubio (R) joined local officials in criticizing the governor and the accelerated process driving state plans to develop golf courses at Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The park, on the Atlantic coast of Florida, contains the largest area of protected scrub jay habitat in southeast Florida.

An unusual bipartisan showing of elected officials in the state Legislature, Cabinet and the US Congress expressed opposition to the plans, which include the construction of disc golf courses, pickleball courts, and cabins. Three of the affected parks are in the Panhandle district in Panama City represented by state senator Jay Trumbull (R). He wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he remains in &quot;strong opposition&quot; and exhorted other lawmakers in the legislature to follow suit. Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, who has lobbied in the state legislature to increase conservation land, said: &quot;Our vision did not contemplate the addition of golf courses and hotels, which in my view are not in-line with the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of nature. From what I know at this time, the proposal should not move forward in its current form.&quot; Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, said that he had learned from media reports about the state park development plan, and that he has &quot;serious concerns&quot;. He issued a statement saying, &quot;(We) have to be really careful when we talk about building infrastructure on state parks. Just because we can do something doesn&#x27;t mean we should.&quot;

Environmental groups and former park officials agreed that the agency was trying to limit the public comment-gathering process. The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; reported that Eric Draper, who served as the director of Florida&#x27;s state parks between 2017 and 2021, stated that it appeared that the agency sidestepped the legal process. The &quot;Times&quot; also noted that Albert Gregory, the former state chief of park planning, said the state was &quot;hop-scotching some important steps&quot;.

<text>Eustace, also rendered [[Eustis (disambiguation)|Eustis]], ( ) is the rendition in English of two phonetically similar Greek given names:
*Εὔσταχυς (&quot;Eústachys&quot;) meaning &quot;fruitful&quot;, &quot;fecund&quot;; literally &quot;abundant in grain&quot;; its Latin equivalents are &quot;Fæcundus/Fecundus&quot;
*Εὐστάθιος (&quot;Eustáthios&quot;) meaning &quot;steadfast&quot;, &quot;stable&quot;; literally &quot;possessing good stability&quot;; its exact Latin equivalents are &quot;Constans&quot; and its derivatives, &quot;Constantius&quot; and &quot;Constantinus&quot;. 

Equivalents in other languages include Ostap (Ukrainian, Russian), Eustachy (Polish, Russian), Yevstaphiy (Russian), Eustachio (Italian), Eustache or Eustathe (French), Eustaquio (Spanish), Eustáquio (Portuguese), Eustàquio (Valencian), Ustes (Guyanese) and Eustice (English). The originally Hebrew name Ethan or Eitan can also mean &quot;steadfast&quot; or &quot;stable&quot;. 

The Greek &quot;Eústachys&quot; is no longer used; &quot;Eustáthios/Ευστάθιος&quot; (usually transliterated &quot;Efstáthios&quot;) on the other hand is still popular and often used in the informal or diminutive Στάθης (&quot;Státhis&quot;).

<text>Giant (stylized as GIANT) was a men&#x27;s magazine based in New York City geared to the urban music market. It began in October 2004 as a bimonthly publication catering to the interests of 20-something men, focusing on pop culture including reviews of video games, movies, fine tobacco, music, everyday happenings and celebrity interviews.

In August 2006, the magazine had a makeover under new editor-in-chief Smokey Fontaine, formerly of the hip hop magazine &quot;America&quot;. Under his leadership, the magazine began to focus on music, lifestyle, and entertainment for the urban reader. Later, Emil Wilbekin served as the standing Editor-In-Chief.

Covers included Beyoncé, Pharrell, Diddy, The Killers, Ciara, Jennifer Hudson, Janet Jackson, and Eve. The June/July issue offered two covers: one of R&amp;B artist Robin Thicke and one of Rihanna. Chris Brown and Prince have also appeared on the cover. Along with the magazine, &quot;Giant&quot;″s website serves as a blog for readers to find additional information on artists that have been featured in the magazine, as well as contests and giveaways.

Radio One, the radio empire started by Cathy Hughes and now presided over by her son, Alfred Liggins, purchased the magazine in January 2007 for a reported $270,000. &quot;Giant&quot; was Radio One&#x27;s first foray into the print media market. The magazine was closed in December 2009.

<text>Derrick Dewan Brooks (born April 18, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for his entire 14-year career in the National Football League (NFL) with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brooks played college football for the Florida State Seminoles, earning consensus All-American honors twice. He was selected by the Buccaneers in the first round of the 1995 NFL draft. An 11-time Pro Bowl selection and five-time first-team All-Pro, Brooks was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2002 en route to winning the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII. Following his retirement, Brooks served as co-owner and president of the Tampa Bay Storm in the Arena Football League (AFL) from 2011 to 2017. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early life==
Brooks attended Washington High School in Pensacola, Florida. In his senior season in 1991, Brooks carried Pensacola to the state playoff semifinals, where they lost to the eventual champion Manatee Hurricanes of Bradenton, Florida. In 2007, he was named to the Florida High School Athletic Association All-Century Team, which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state of Florida&#x27;s history.

==College career==
While attending Florida State University, he played for the Seminoles from 1991 to 1994. He was a four-year letterman, a consensus first-team All-American his junior and senior years, and a three-time first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) selection. After playing as safety as a freshman he switched to linebacker as a sophomore. He was a member of the 1993 Seminoles National Championship team. He finished his career with 274 tackles, five interceptions, 8.5 sacks, 13 passes defensed, four forced fumbles, and three fumble recoveries.

In November 2010, Florida State retired Seminoles jersey number 10 in honor of Brooks.

===Awards and honors===
* 3× First-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (1992, 1993, 1994)
* ACC Defensive Player of the Year (1993)
* 2× Consensus first-team All-American (1993, 1994)
* 2× Vince Lombardi Award finalist (1993, 1994)
* Bowl Coalition National Championship (1993)

==Professional career==
=== Early career (1995–2001) ===
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Brooks in the first round (28th overall) of the 1995 NFL draft. The Buccaneers traded both of their second-round picks (46th overall and 63rd overall) to the Dallas Cowboys for their first-round pick (28th overall) and used the pick to draft Brooks. Brooks was the second linebacker drafted in 1995 NFL Draft, behind Washington State&#x27;s Mark Fields (13th overall).

Brooks played 14 years for the Buccaneers and is widely considered one of the best players in franchise history and one of the best linebackers in NFL history. From 1995 to 2008, Brooks started 221 of 224 games, recording 1,698 tackles, 13.5 sacks, 25 interceptions, and six touchdowns (tied for the most in NFL history by a linebacker with Bobby Bell). He was selected to the Pro Bowl 11 times, including 10 straight from 1997 to 2006, was an All-Pro nine times, was the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2002, and led the team to the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXVII.

As a rookie in 1995, Brooks started 13 of 16 games. He finished the season with 78 tackles with a sack and earned first-team all-rookie honors from &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; and &quot;Pro Football Writers Association&quot;. During his second season 1996, he started all 16 games and finished with a team-leading 132 tackles and his first career interception. In 1997, Brooks earned his first trip to the Pro Bowl after recording 144 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and two interceptions in 16 games. In 1998, Brooks had another Pro Bowl season after recording 156 tackles and an interception.

In 1999, Brooks made the Pro Bowl for the third time and was a first-team All-Pro selection for the first time in his career. For the season, he had 153 tackles, two sacks, and four interceptions. In 2000, Brooks earned his fourth consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl and his second consecutive first-team All-Pro selection. He finished the season with 140 tackles, a sack, and had his first career touchdown on a 34-yard interception from Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper. Brooks was also, along with Jim Flanigan of the Chicago Bears, the winner of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, given to a National Football League player for his community service activities as well as his excellence on the field. Brooks made his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl in 2001 after recording 112 tackles and three interceptions.

=== Continued success and Super Bowl victory (2002–2008) ===

Brooks&#x27; best season came in 2002. During that year he was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year by the &quot;Associated Press&quot; and helped the Buccaneers win the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl. He also made his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl and was a first-team All-Pro selection for the third time. For the season he had 117 tackles, a sack, five interceptions, and returned an NFL record, for a linebacker, four touchdowns (one off a fumble and three off interceptions). During the Buccaneers 48–21 victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII, he returned an interception off of Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon 44 yards for the clinching touchdown.

In 2003, Brooks broke Lee Roy Selmon&#x27;s team record for most consecutive Pro Bowl appearances with seven. He finished the season with 101 tackles, a sack, two interceptions, and returned an interception for a touchdown. In 2004, Brooks made his eighth consecutive Pro Bowl and fifth- first-team All-Pro selection after recording 137 tackles, three sacks, and an interception. In 2005, Brooks made his ninth consecutive Pro Bowl and earned his sixth first-team All-Pro selection. He finished the season with 125 tackles, three sacks, and an interception.

In Brooks&#x27; 10th consecutive Pro Bowl in 2006, he was named the MVP after returning a Trent Green interception 59 yards for a touchdown to secure the victory for the NFC. During the regular season he had 121 tackles, three interceptions and a touchdown. In 2007, Brooks had 109 tackles and was not voted to the Pro Bowl for the first time since 1996. In Brooks&#x27; last year with the Buccaneers in 2008, he recorded 73 tackles and an interception and was selected to his 11th Pro Bowl. The 11 Pro Bowls are tied for second-most by a linebacker in NFL history.

=== Tampa Bay exit and retirement ===
On February 25, 2009, the Buccaneers released Brooks. He was one of five veterans that the Bucs released on that day. The others were wide receivers Joey Galloway and Ike Hilliard, running back Warrick Dunn and linebacker Cato June. The Bucs had previously fired Head Coach Jon Gruden and General Manager Bruce Allen and were looking to build a younger team under the likes of Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik. Brooks never missed a game in his 14 years in Tampa Bay, a total of 224 consecutive games. He was the starting weakside linebacker for the last 208 of those games, an NFL record for that position and the second-longest consecutive start streak for &quot;any&quot; linebacker in NFL history.

<text>Jeffrey Garlin (born June 5, 1962) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He is best known for playing Murray Goldberg, patriarch of the eponymous family in the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, and Jeff Greene on the HBO sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. He also played Marvin on &quot;Mad About You&quot; and Mort Meyers on &quot;Arrested Development&quot; for Fox and Netflix.

Garlin has also appeared in &quot;ParaNorman&quot;, &quot;WALL-E&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, and &quot;Safety Not Guaranteed&quot;, among other films.

==Early life==
Garlin was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Gene and Carole (née Crafton) Garlin. He grew up in Morton Grove, Illinois, where his father owned a plumbing supply business called Bilko and his mother was active in community theater. He has a younger brother, Michael. Garlin is Jewish and attended Hebrew school.

Garlin has said he wanted to be a comedian since he was eight, when he saw Jimmy Durante perform in Chicago. Garlin attended Melzer Elementary School in Morton Grove. He enjoyed playing sports at school, but had to stop after being diagnosed with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, a heart ailment.

When Garlin was in sixth grade, his father sold his supply business and the family relocated to South Florida. He graduated from Nova High School in Davie, Florida, in 1980. He attended Broward Community College, followed by a stint studying film at the University of Miami, where he first began to perform stand-up comedy.

==Career==
===Standup===
In 1984, aged 22, Garlin moved back to Chicago to pursue a stand-up comedy career. He performed with the comedy troupe The Second City. He worked in the box office with Stephen Colbert.

While living in Wrigleyville, Chicago during the 1980s, Garlin was briefly roommates with Conan O&#x27;Brien, who was then a comedy writer. He remains close to O&#x27;Brien, and after O&#x27;Brien was removed as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 2010 so that Jay Leno could return, Garlin said he would not be a guest on the show again.

Garlin was hired by comedians Denis Leary and Jon Stewart to help develop their specials. He worked as a stage director for their shows and edited the scripts. He worked with Larry David in this same way. He continues to do standup, where he says he improvises a lot on stage, and feels very relaxed, &quot;maybe too relaxed.&quot;

===Film and television===
Garlin has a variety of television and film appearances to his credit, as an actor and a stand up, including &quot;Dr. Katz&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, &quot;The Life and Times of Tim&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and &quot;Entourage&quot;.

From 1997 to 1999, Garlin spent three seasons on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Mad About You&quot; in the role of Marvin. He co-stars in and executive produces the HBO series &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. He had a recurring role on the series &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; as Uncle Kelbo, appearing in three episodes over the first three seasons.

After making an uncredited début as Gut Gut in &quot;Spring Break&quot; (1983), Garlin earned his first film credit in Dolly Parton&#x27;s 1992 comedy &quot;Straight Talk&quot;. He had a small role in &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; as &quot;Donut Jerk&quot; after a member of the casting crew saw him eat a doughnut while leaving Krispy Kreme with an additional two dozen doughnuts. He also had a cameo appearance in &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; in 1999.

Other cameo appearances include &quot;Run Ronnie Run!&quot;, &quot;After the Sunset&quot;, &quot;Fat Albert&quot;, and &quot;Sleepover&quot;. He appeared in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Full Frontal&quot; (2002) and in &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; (2003). In 2005, he had a small role in &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;.

In 2008, Garlin appeared in &quot;The Rocker&quot; as Stan, and played Ed Lawson in &quot;Strange Wilderness&quot;. He lent his voice to the Disney/Pixar films &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, as Buttercup. He appeared as Sid, alongside Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, in the 2010 comedy action film &quot;The Bounty Hunter&quot;. He played Ed Burch in &quot;Laggies&quot;, released in 2014.

His feature directorial debut, &quot;I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With&quot; (which he also wrote), premiered to favorable reviews at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival. It opened in September 2007. The film co-starred Sarah Silverman and Bonnie Hunt.

In 2006, Garlin directed &quot;This Filthy World&quot;, a one-man show performed by director John Waters. He was a voice actor in &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), as B. McCrea, the captain of the &quot;Axiom&quot; spaceship. Garlin executive produced the documentary &quot;Finding Vivian Maier&quot; (2013).

In 2013, Garlin signed onto the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, which premiered on September 24, 2013. He played Murray Goldberg, the father of the title family. In December 2021, as shooting of the show&#x27;s ninth season neared completion, Garlin left the series following misconduct allegations and investigations by the show&#x27;s human resources department, initially reported in November 2019. For the rest of the season, Garlin&#x27;s character continued to appear on the show via outtakes, a stand-in, and CGI. The character was later killed off in the show&#x27;s tenth and final season.

In July 2013, Garlin directed his second film, &quot;Dealin&#x27; with Idiots&quot;, inspired by his experiences with his sons in Little League. The entire film was improvised.

In October 2019, Garlin revealed he would have a role in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, the final installment of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, which was released on December 20, 2019. He played Junn Gobint.

====Misconduct allegations====
On December 3, 2021, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published an article detailing that Garlin had been under investigation for three years for &quot;allegedly engag[ing] in a pattern of verbal and physical conduct on [the set of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;] that made people uncomfortable&quot;. The report found that he had used &quot;inappropriate language&quot; and engaged in &quot;unwanted physical contact&quot; on set such as hugging or touching others without their consent. On December 15, 2021, it was announced that Garlin would not return to the show. His departure was said to be a mutual decision.

===Writing===
In 2010, Garlin published a book, &quot;My Footprint: Carrying the Weight of the World&quot;, a memoir that documents his journey to lessen his carbon footprint.

===Podcast===
On the comedy podcast network Earwolf Garlin hosted &quot;By the Way, In Conversation with Jeff Garlin&quot;, which consisted of unscripted talks rather than formal interviews. The debut episode featured Garlin&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; co-star Larry David. The twice monthly installments were recorded in front of a live audience at Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles. The podcast&#x27;s last episode was released in February 2015.

In August 2020, Garlin was a guest DJ on SiriusXM&#x27;s Tom Petty Radio.

==Influences==
Katie Puckrik in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;British comedy is a touchstone for Garlin&quot;. Garlin has said: &quot;Monty Python changed my life. I watched the original &quot;Office&quot;. I love &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; and &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. I&#x27;m a fanatic about Ealing comedies. And &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; is probably my favorite thing that I&#x27;ve ever seen come out of England.&quot;

==Personal life==

Garlin married Marla Beth Cahan on July 24, 1994. They have two sons. In September 2018, they announced their intention to divorce. In March 2020, Garlin said that he and Cahan were at the end of their divorce proceedings. He has been dating Sari Tracht, an editor, since early 2021.

Garlin is a fan of the Chicago Cubs. Every year on his birthday, he attends a game with his friend Kevin Cronin, lead singer of REO Speedwagon.

According to his book, Garlin voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 election.

Garlin practices transcendental meditation, which he does twice a day. He says it has helped him with symptoms of ADHD.

For a few years, Garlin lived with talk-show host Conan O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien has said that sometimes Garlin woke him up in the middle of the night and made him perform skits.

Garlin&#x27;s dog on the television show &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; lives with him in real life.

On September 20, 2022, Garlin announced that he has been struggling with bipolar disorder, writing: &quot;Bipolar is a motherfucker. Sometimes it&#x27;s just too much to deal with. I&#x27;m doing the best I can. This the first time that I&#x27;ve opened up about this.&quot;

===Health===
In his late 20s, Garlin had surgery in Oklahoma City to correct the heart condition Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, a defect in an accessory electrical conduction pathway in the heart that results in tachycardia. Garlin said he was an early recipient (#72) of the surgery, which millions of people have undergone.

In February 2000, before filming began on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, he had a stroke at the age of 37. During the early episodes of season one, he had noticeably slurred speech that later improved. In addition to epilepsy and attention deficit disorder, he has type II diabetes, which he controls with diet and exercise. Garlin has written about his problems with food and discussed his weight problems publicly. In a 2011 interview, he said: &quot;I think people look at fat people as having a lack of willpower when willpower has nothing to do with it. I didn&#x27;t change my life until I approached everything like an addict. I haven&#x27;t had sweets in almost three years because I know if I have one cookie, just like if an alcoholic has his first drink, I&#x27;m off to the races and I&#x27;m back eating sugar again.&quot;

<doc id="1283378" wikidata="Q749592" url="?curid=1283378" title="Jugular vein">
<text>The jugular veins are veins that take blood from the head back to the heart via the superior vena cava. The internal jugular vein descends next to the internal carotid artery and continues posteriorly to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

==Structure and function==
There are two sets of jugular veins: external and internal.
The left and right external jugular veins drain into the subclavian veins. The internal jugular veins join with the subclavian veins more medially to form the brachiocephalic veins. Finally, the left and right brachiocephalic veins join to form the superior vena cava, which delivers deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart. The jugular vein has tributaries consisting of petrosal sinus, facial, lingual, pharylingual, the thyroid, and sometimes the occipital vein.

===Internal===

The internal jugular vein is formed by the anastomosis of blood from the sigmoid sinus of the dura mater and the inferior petrosal sinus. The internal jugular runs with the common carotid artery and vagus nerve inside the carotid sheath. It provides venous drainage for the contents of the skull.

===External===

The external jugular vein runs superficially to sternocleidomastoid.

There is also another minor jugular vein, the anterior jugular vein, draining the submaxillary region.

==Clinical significance==
===Pressure===
The jugular venous pressure is an indirectly observed pressure over the venous system. It can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease.

In the jugular veins pressure waveform, upward deflections correspond with (A) atrial contraction, (C) ventricular contraction (and resulting bulging of perspicuous into the right atrium during isovolumic systole), and (V) atrial venous filling. The downward deflections correspond with (X) the atrium relaxing (and the perspicuous valve moving downward) and (y) the filling of ventricle after the tricuspid opens.

Components include:
* The a peak is caused by the contraction of the right atrium.
* The av minimum is due to relaxation of the right atrium and closure of the tricuspid valve.
* The c peak reflects the pressure rise in the right ventricle early during systole and the resultant bulging of the tricuspid valve—which has just closed—into the right atrium.
* The x minimum occurs as the ventricle contracts and shortens during the ejection phase, later in systole. The shortening heart—with tricuspid valve still closed—pulls on valve opens, the v peak begins to wane.
* The y minimum reflects a fall in right atrial pressure during rapid ventricular filling, as blood leaves the right atrium through an open tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. The increase in venous pressure after the y minimum occurs as venous return continues in the face of reduced ventricular filling.
=== Diseases and conditions ===
The jugular vein is prominent in heart failure. When the patient is sitting or in a semirecumbent position, the height of the jugular veins and their pulsations provides an estimate of the central venous pressure and gives important information about whether the heart is keeping up with the demands on it or is failing. Distension of the jugular is a potential sign of heart failure, cardiac tamponade, or coronary artery disease

Examination of the neck veins is routinely performed to evaluate atrial pressure and to estimate intravascular volume in patients with dyspnea, edema, or hypovolemia. Elevated venous pressure may indicate left or right ventricular failure or heart disease.

Symptoms associated with abnormal flow or pressure in the jugular veins include hearing loss, dizziness, blurry vision, swollen eyes, neck pain, headaches, and sleeping difficulty.

==Idiomatic expression==
The jugular vein is the subject of an idiom in the English language: &quot;to go for the jugular&quot; means to attack decisively at the weakest point. However, this phrase is anatomically inaccurate, as the jugular is not the most critical or vulnerable point in the cardiovascular system. The jugular vein runs parallel to the carotid artery and operates under much lower pressure, returning deoxygenated blood to the heart, whereas the carotid artery, a high-pressure vessel supplying oxygenated blood to the brain, is far more critical and vulnerable in sustaining cerebral circulation. Therefore, to attack at the weakest point, the idiom should be “to go for the carotid”.

<text>Thiotrichales is an order of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria within the class Gammaproteobacteria known for their large size and ability to live in sulfur rich environments. 

==Characteristics==
Thiotrichales has an important role in the sulfur and nitrogen cycles in marine and freshwater sediments, hydrothermal vents, and areas with an accumulation of organic matter. Most species oxidize sulfur compounds for energy metabolism. They often use nitrate as an electron acceptor, which contributes to the detoxification of sulfide-rich environments.

These bacteria thrive when there is a gradient between oxygenated and anoxic zones, that can occur around hydrothermal vents. This is where Thiotrichales usually form microbial mats and biofilms is sulfur is abundant. This species of microbe can also be present in cold seep ecosystems where methane and sulfide seep through the seafloor.

Thiotricales vary greatly in size. 

==Ecological importance==

They can form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, mostly marine invertebrates like mussels and worms. They help these organisms survive in environments lacking nutrients by performing sulfur oxidation which provides them with needed nutrients. This is especially important in environments that contain high levels of toxic sulfide. Through sulfur oxidation, Thiotricales effectively detoxify sulfide in marine and freshwater sediments, hydrothermal vents, and areas with large accumulations of organic matter making the regions more hospitable to other organisms.

<text>Michael Rashard Clayton (born October 13, 1982) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the LSU Tigers and was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 15th overall in the 2004 NFL draft.

==Early life==
Clayton prepped at Christian Life Academy in Baton Rouge where he was one of the most sought after recruits in the nation during his senior year. He played in the first ever U.S. Army All-American Bowl on December 30, 2000, alongside fellow LSU teammates Ben Wilkerson, Andrew Whitworth, and Marcus Spears. Michael also played basketball there. In 2008, he became the first inductee in the Christian Life Academy Hall of Fame.

==College career==
Clayton played college football at Louisiana State University, where he was part of the NCAA champion LSU Tigers in 2003. During his three years with LSU, he caught 182 passes for 2,582 yards and 21 TDs for the Tigers, and ended his LSU career with the record for career TD receptions with 21. The record was later broken by Dwayne Bowe in a game against Tennessee on November 4, 2006. He finished second in school history in receptions with 182, just one shy of tying Wendell Davis&#x27;s record of 183. He is ranked fourth in career receiving yards with 2,582 and seventh in career 100-yard games, and is the only player in LSU history to have at least 700 yards receiving in three straight seasons.
Clayton is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Clayton was initiated into the Nu Psi chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in the Spring of 2003.

==Professional career==
===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Clayton was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 15th selection of the first round of the 2004 NFL draft. After a promising 2004 rookie campaign with Tampa Bay, where he led all NFL rookies and the Buccaneers with 80 receptions for 1193 yards, and his team with 7 touchdowns, Clayton had a relatively disappointing season in 2005. With knee surgery in the offseason and a season riddled with small mistakes on the field, he finished with 32 receptions for a total of 372 yards and no touchdowns. He was forced to sit out the final game of the regular season against the New Orleans Saints with a turf toe injury, and also sat out the Buccaneers playoff match-up against the Washington Redskins. His second season was very disappointing and inconsistent.

The start to the 2006 season showed that Clayton had returned to his healthy past of 2004. Clayton had 3 receptions and 34 yards despite the Buccaneers offensive struggles on September 10 in a 27–0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Continuing his return to his 2004 form, he caught 6 passes for 55 yards and a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 15, 2006. His touchdown, thrown by Bruce Gradkowski, came with seconds left and gave the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the go ahead lead for their first win of the 2006 season. Unfortunately, following an undisclosed injury, the Buccaneers placed him on injured reserve, ending his season with four games remaining.

He followed that overall performance with a forgettable 2007 season, although he did come on strong down the stretch. He made the most of his opportunities at the end, when the Buccaneers were resting many of their starters (which many analysts considered a mistake). He caught 22 passes during his 14-game season, 16 of those came in the last four contests and 10 coming in the last two. He also amassed 192 of his 301 yards in those four games.

Clayton got to play in his first post-season contest on January 6, 2008, against the eventual Super Bowl-champion New York Giants. He caught 3 passes for 39 yards.

After the 2008 season Clayton became a free agent, but re-signed with the Buccaneers to a new five-year deal. After signing the deal he made the famous &quot;check is in the bank&quot; quote. The Bucs released Clayton on September 4, 2010.

===United Football League===
Clayton joined the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League on October 25, 2010.

===New York Giants===
On November 23, 2010, Clayton signed a one-year contract with the New York Giants following injuries to Giants receivers Steve Smith, Hakeem Nicks and Ramses Barden. The move also reunited Clayton with Giants quarterback Eli Manning with whom he shared a dorm during the NFL combine in 2004. On September 3, 2011, Clayton was cut by the Giants

On September 23, 2011, the Giants re-signed Clayton after placing Domenik Hixon on injured reserve. In the 2011–2012 season, Clayton and the Giants beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl 21–17, earning Clayton his first Super Bowl ring. He became a free agent after the season.

<doc id="1283397" wikidata="Q2580478" url="?curid=1283397" title="Third Doctor">
<text>The Third Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was portrayed by actor Jon Pertwee. Within the series&#x27; narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates. Consequently, both the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Preceded in regeneration by the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton), he is followed by the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker).

Pertwee portrays the Third Doctor as a dapper man of action, in stark contrast to his wily but less action-orientated predecessors. While previous Doctors&#x27; stories had all involved time and space travel, for production reasons Pertwee&#x27;s stories initially depicted the Doctor stranded on Earth in exile, where he worked as a scientific advisor to the international military group UNIT. Within the story, the Third Doctor came into existence as part of a punishment from his own race, the Time Lords, who forced him to regenerate and also disabled his TARDIS. Eventually, this restriction is lifted and the Third Doctor embarks on more traditional time travel and space exploration stories.

His initial companion is UNIT scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John), who leaves the Doctor&#x27;s company between episodes to be replaced by Jo Grant (Katy Manning), who then continues to accompany the Doctor after he regains use of his TARDIS. His final companion is journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen).

==Biography==
After the Doctor was found guilty of breaking the Time Lord laws of non-interference and forced to regenerate, he began his third incarnation in exile on 20th century Earth. The Third Doctor immediately formed a working relationship with the British contingent of UNIT, an international organisation tasked to investigate and defend the Earth against extraterrestrial threats.

It was a partnership initially born out of convenience — the Doctor required facilities to try to repair his TARDIS to break the exile, and UNIT needed his expertise to combat the threats they encountered. There is some disagreement about when the Third Doctor&#x27;s UNIT stories were set, with some evidence that they were contemporary stories set at the same time they were broadcast (the early 70s), and some evidence that they were set in the near future. According to the production team, there was an intention to set the stories in the near future, but the writers did not always remember this and set the stories in the present.

The Doctor also developed a good working relationship with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, whom he had first encountered, in his previous incarnation, as a Colonel in command of troops fighting Yeti and the Cybermen. As well as the Brigadier, he developed friendships with other regular UNIT colleagues including Sergeant Benton and Captain Mike Yates. When meteors were seen falling to Earth in Essex, the Doctor together with a UNIT scientist named Liz Shaw were to face the Autons for the first time. The Autons were to be one of the Doctor&#x27;s recurring foes. At the conclusion of this adventure, the Doctor became UNIT&#x27;s scientific advisor. After facing Silurians, the so-called Ambassadors of Death and the Inferno project, Liz was replaced as the Doctor&#x27;s assistant by a feisty but slightly scatter-brained young woman named Jo Grant.

After meeting Jo, the Third Doctor encountered his greatest nemesis (next to the Daleks) — the Master. A renegade Time Lord, the Master plagued the Third Doctor with his diabolical schemes, including the summoning of an ancient Dæmon, and unleashing the terrifyingly powerful Kronos, a Chronovore. The Doctor&#x27;s exile continued until it was lifted by the Time Lords after he helped save them from destruction at the hands of Omega. The Third Doctor, free to roam space and time again, soon ran into the Master and an even older enemy — the Daleks. Although the Master was a criminal genius, the Doctor was always able to outwit him in all his schemes. Whilst facing the ecological destruction wrought by Global Chemicals and the super computer BOSS, Jo met and fell in love with Dr. Clifford Jones. Marrying Jones and following him to the Amazon on an expedition, Jo left a saddened Doctor.

The fiercely independent investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith became the Doctor&#x27;s new companion after stowing away in his TARDIS. The Third Doctor&#x27;s final adventures saw them defeating the Sontarans in medieval England and the Daleks on the planet Exxilon. The Third Doctor contracted radiation poisoning on the planet Metebelis 3, during the events of Planet of the Spiders. When the TARDIS brought him back to UNIT headquarters, he collapsed, regenerating into the Fourth Doctor.

==Personality==
The Third Doctor was a suave, dapper, technologically orientated and authoritative man of action who practised Venusian Aikido. A keen scientist, he maintained a laboratory at UNIT where he enjoyed working on gadgets in his TARDIS. In his spare time, he was fond of motoring, handling all manner of vehicles. His favourite car was a canary-yellow vintage roadster that he nicknamed &quot;Bessie&quot;, a machine which featured such modifications as a remote control, dramatically increased speed capabilities and inertial dampers. He also maintained a hovercraft-like vessel that fans nicknamed the Whomobile. The First Doctor, upon meeting the Third, described him indignantly as a &quot;dandy&quot;, while the Second Doctor, with whom the Third had something of an antagonistic relationship on the occasions they encountered each other, referred to him as &quot;Fancy Pants&quot;.

While this incarnation spent most of his time exiled on Earth—grudgingly working as UNIT&#x27;s scientific advisor—he was occasionally sent on covert missions by the Time Lords, where he would often act as a reluctant mediator. Even though he developed a fondness for Earthlings with whom he worked (such as Liz Shaw and Jo Grant), he jumped at any chance to return to the stars. Though he had a somewhat patrician and authoritarian air, he was quick to criticise authority, and often exclaimed &quot;Now &quot;listen&quot; to me!&quot; when dealing with people seeking to obstruct him.

Despite his occasional arrogance, the Third Doctor genuinely cared for his companions in a paternal fashion, and even held a thinly veiled but grudging admiration for his nemesis, the Master, and for UNIT&#x27;s leader, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, with whom he eventually became friends. In fact, even when his much-resented exile was lifted, the moral and dashing Third Doctor continued to help UNIT protect the Earth from all manner of alien threats, a role that continued into his future incarnations.

In general, this incarnation of the Doctor was more physically daring than the previous two and was the first to confront an enemy physically if cornered (both of his previous incarnations nearly always attempted to dodge, flee or negotiate rather than attack). This often took the form of quick strikes, with the occasional joint lock or throw — usually enough to get himself and anyone accompanying him out of immediate danger, but usually not to the extent of a brawl, in keeping with the Doctor&#x27;s non-violent nature. He only used his fighting skills if he had no alternative, and even then generally disarmed his opponents rather than knocking them unconscious. Indeed, his martial prowess was such that a single, sudden strike was usually enough to halt whatever threatened him, and at one point he reminded Captain Yates of UNIT (physically as well as verbally) that Yates would have a difficult time removing him from somewhere when he did not want to be removed (&quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;).

The Third Doctor was a skilled diplomat (keeping talks going in &quot;The Curse of Peladon,&quot; for example) and linguist, as well as having a penchant for disguises.

===Appearance===

When asked to attend a &quot;Radio Times&quot; photo-call in 1969, Jon Pertwee arrived in what he thought was &quot;a suitably eccentric outfit&quot; from his family wardrobe, and the flamboyant image stuck with producer Barry Letts. Through the first two seasons, he wore a flowing, crimson-lined cape over a black velvet smoking jacket and a ruffled shirt with a variety of neckties such as jabots, bow ties or cravats. Beginning in the 1971 season, when the look was refashioned by Ken Trew, Pertwee wore a red jacket and a cloak with purple lining. In the final two seasons, the colour scheme changed from story to story, though the basic look was maintained.

In his first episode, when the Doctor evades capture by taking a shower, a tattoo of a serpent can be seen on his arm. Whereas Pertwee obtained it during his service in the Royal Navy, an in-universe reason for it was eventually provided in the New Adventures novel &quot;Christmas on a Rational Planet&quot; as being a Time Lord symbol signifying exile, removed once the Doctor&#x27;s exile was formally ended following the events of &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;.

==Story style==
The Third Doctor stories were the first to be broadcast in colour. The early ones were set on Earth because he had been exiled there when the Second Doctor was banished to Earth by his people, the Time Lords, and forced to regenerate. On Earth, he worked with the Brigadier and the rest of the UNIT team. However, as his tenure progressed he had reasons to leave Earth, on occasion being sent on missions by the Time Lords. Eventually, after his defeat of the renegade Omega in &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, he was granted complete freedom by the Time Lords in gratitude for saving Gallifrey.

The Third Doctor&#x27;s era introduced adversaries including the Autons, the Master, Omega, the Sontarans, the Silurians and the Sea Devils. The Daleks returned after a five-year absence about halfway through Pertwee&#x27;s run. The Third Doctor was the only one from the classic series not to have a story featuring the Cybermen (although they were seen briefly in &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot; and &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot;), but he did eventually encounter them during &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;.

==&quot;Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow&quot;==
A catchphrase devised during the Third Doctor&#x27;s era was &quot;reverse the polarity of the neutron flow&quot;. Terrance Dicks recalls that he had used the line in a script, and Pertwee approached him about the line. Knowing that Pertwee struggled with technobabble in the role, Dicks had feared that he would have to remove the line, but Pertwee stated that he found it manageable and wanted to see it more often.

The Third Doctor only said the full phrase &quot;reverse the polarity of the neutron flow&quot; twice on screen – in &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972) and the 20th Anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), with numerous other examples of &quot;reverse the polarity&quot; and earlier instances of &quot;fusing the control of the neutron flow&quot; and &quot;change the polarity&quot;. Pertwee used the phrase when he acted in the stage play &quot;Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure&quot; in 1989. When Colin Baker took over the role in the play he amended the line to &quot;Reverse the linearity of the proton flow.&quot; In the radio play &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot;, the Brigadier asks &quot;Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?&quot; and the Doctor proceeds to explain that the phrase is meaningless (though in reality neutrons can be polarized by a magnetic field, such that reversing the magnetic field&#x27;s direction reverses the polarity of the neutrons).

The full phrase was used in several Target novelisations. It was subsequently used by the Fourth Doctor (in &quot;City of Death&quot;) and the Fifth Doctor (in &quot;Castrovalva&quot; and &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;). Together with &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, this resulted in the phrase being used as a nostalgic reference. In the Tenth Doctor episode &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;, the Doctor, while hiding in Lazarus&#x27; machine, comments that it had taken him too long to reverse the polarity due to being out of practice. The Tenth Doctor uses the full phrase in &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;.

During the episode &quot;The Almost People&quot;, a clone of the Eleventh Doctor speaks the phrase while reliving the memories of all his predecessors. He goes on to conflate it with his regeneration-spanning love of jelly babies, remarking that they need to &quot;reverse the jelly baby of the neutron flow&quot;. In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor invokes the phrase when confronting a time portal with the Tenth Doctor, suggesting that they both &quot;reverse the polarity&quot; with their sonic screwdrivers (which merely neutralizes each other&#x27;s efforts). In &quot;The Girl Who Died&quot;, the Twelfth Doctor tells Clara Oswald he is &quot;Reversing the polarity of the neutron flow&quot;, followed by &quot;I bet that means something. It sounds great.&quot; Clara herself uses the phrase, saying she &quot;reversed the polarity&quot; of a mind-wiping device to prevent the Doctor from erasing her memories of him from her mind (&quot;Hell Bent&quot;). In &quot;It Takes You Away&quot;, Yaz Khan suggests that the Thirteenth Doctor reverse the polarity on the sonic screwdriver in order to (successfully) open a locked inter-universe portal.

==Title sequence and logo==
The original title sequence for the Third Doctor&#x27;s seasons introduced colour and was an extension of the &quot;howlround&quot; kaleidoscopic patterns used for the previous Doctors. It features red, black then green flaming hands, then shows Jon Pertwee&#x27;s face followed by a series of swirling lines to represent the time vortex. As the vortex turns red it speeds up only to start reversing, and in some cases it is seen turning pink and yellow. In the Third Doctor&#x27;s final season, a new title sequence was introduced using a full-body picture of Pertwee, designed by Bernard Lodge. Partially inspired by the slit-scan hyperspace sequence in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, one portion of this sequence is the prototype for the time tunnel sequence of the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s seasons. The Third Doctor&#x27;s final season also introduced the diamond logo which would remain in use until 1980 and be revived in 2022.

The series logo introduced in 1970 and used for the first four seasons of Pertwee&#x27;s tenure would later be used again, in modified form, as the logo for the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie. This version subsequently became the official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; logo, most notably with regards to products connected to the Eighth Doctor. With the introduction of a new official series logo in 2005, the 1996 logo continued to be used by Big Finish Productions as the logo for all pre-2005 series material including books and audio dramas, and by the BBC on DVD releases of episodes from the 1963–89 series, books and audio.

==Later appearances==
The Third Doctor appeared again in the 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, broadcast in 1983. A stage play, &quot;Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure&quot;, was produced in 1989, starring Jon Pertwee (occasionally replaced by an understudy then later, until the end of the production run, by Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor). In 1993, he played the role again for the 30th Anniversary charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, and in the audio drama &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot;. Months before his death, he played the Doctor for the final time in the audio drama &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot;.

<doc id="1283412" wikidata="Q1882435" url="?curid=1283412" title="McLean">
<text>MacLean, also spelt McLean, is a Scottish Gaelic surname (Mac Gille Eathain, or, Mac Giolla Eóin in Irish Gaelic), Eóin being a Gaelic form of Johannes (John). The clan surname is an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Mac Gille Eathain&quot;, a patronymic meaning &quot;son of Gillean&quot;. Gillean means &quot;the Servant of [Saint] John [the Baptist]&quot;), named for Gilleathain na Tuaidh, known as &quot;Gillian of the Battleaxe&quot;, a famous 5th century warrior.

Eachan Reaganach and his brother Lachlan were descended from Gilleathain na Tuaidh, and are the progenitors of the clan. The family grew very powerful throughout the Hebrides and Highlands through alliances with the Catholic Church in Scotland in the 9th century, the MacDonalds in the 13th century, and the MacKays and MacLeods in the 16th century. Other spellings of the name include McClean, MacLaine, McLaine, McLain, MacLane, and many others.

Duart Castle is the seat of Clan MacLean.

<text>Brian David Griese ( ; born March 18, 1975) is an American professional football coach and former player who was the quarterbacks coach for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). A former quarterback in the NFL, he played college football for the Michigan Wolverines and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft.

Griese played three seasons at the University of Michigan, leading the Wolverines to win the 1997 national championship. After being selected in the third round by the Denver Broncos in the 1998 NFL draft, he earned a Super Bowl ring with the Broncos in his rookie season, as a backup to John Elway in Super Bowl XXXIII. Elway retired after the Super Bowl and Griese became the starting quarterback for the Broncos during the 1999 season. Griese was a Pro Bowl selection with the Broncos in 2000. After leaving the Broncos he started at quarterback for the Miami Dolphins (5 games in 2003), Chicago Bears (13 games in 2006 and 2007) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21 games in 2004, 2005, 2008). He is the son of Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese. Griese is a former color commentator for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on ESPN.

==Early life==
Griese was born in Miami, Florida and attended Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, playing football, basketball and golf. Brian is the son of former NFL Quarterback Bob Griese, who spent his entire career with the Miami Dolphins.

==College career==
Griese played college football at the University of Michigan from 1993 to 1997. Michigan did not offer him a scholarship, so he walked on to the football team. He turned down scholarship offers from Purdue (his father&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;) and Kentucky. After he was redshirted in 1993 and limited to placeholding duties in 1994, Griese took over as the starting quarterback after Scott Dreisbach was injured five games into the 1995 season. Griese started for the remainder of the 1995 season, capped by an upset of #2 ranked Ohio State, 31–23.

At the beginning of the 1996 season, Dreisbach regained his starting job and Griese returned to the bench, serving as the team&#x27;s pooch punter. However, after Dreisbach struggled, Griese replaced him at halftime against Ohio State, where he led the Wolverines to another upset victory over the Buckeyes, 13–9. Griese finished the season starting in a 17–14 loss to Alabama in the Outback Bowl.

In 1997, Griese remained the starter. Along with Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, he led the Wolverines to an undefeated season and a share of the national championship. Griese was selected as the MVP of the 1998 Rose Bowl, passing for 251 yards and three touchdowns in Michigan&#x27;s win over Washington State.

In his Michigan career, Griese had a 17–5 record as a starter. The Wolverines won all three games against Ohio State in which he quarterbacked. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 30, 2012.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Denver Broncos===
The Denver Broncos selected Griese in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft. He began his career as a third-string back up to Bubby Brister and John Elway. He became a Super Bowl champion in 1998, though he spent most of the season on the sidelines. Following Elway&#x27;s retirement in 1999, Griese became the Broncos&#x27; starting quarterback. Griese earned a 75.6 passer rating during his first season as starter, but improved the next year, raising it to 102.9. His efforts merited him an invite to the 2001 Pro Bowl.

Griese consistently completed a high percentage of his passes. He has had four seasons with a better than 64% completion rate, including one year (2004) when he completed 69.3% of his passes. Nevertheless, he was unable to establish himself as one of the elite quarterbacks of the league, due to injuries and a penchant for interceptions. He was released by the Broncos, following the 2002 season, and was replaced by former Cardinals starter Jake Plummer.

===Miami Dolphins===
In June 2003 he signed with the Miami Dolphins. His stint with the Dolphins, where his father Bob Griese played his entire 14-year career, was brief, being released in February 2004. Griese was given the starting job when the Dolphins starting quarterback Jay Fiedler got injured. Griese had an excellent start as a Dolphin, passing for 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions in a blowout victory against San Diego.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers (first stint)===
Griese signed with and performed well for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and provided a catalyst for the jumpstart of the Tampa offense. Griese helped them to their only victories in 2004 with a 97.5 QB rating and to a 5–1 record in 2005 before succumbing to a torn ACL. Griese was cut by the Buccaneers in 2006 after the injury to his knee in order to free up money for the salary cap.

===Chicago Bears===
On March 21, 2006, he signed a five-year contract with the Chicago Bears.

After signing with the Bears, Griese saw limited action. Though he fared better than Rex Grossman during the 2006 preseason, coach Lovie Smith decided to keep Griese as the Bears’ second-string quarterback. He took late fourth quarter snaps at the end of major victories. Though Grossman started every Bears game in the 2006 season, Smith allowed Griese some extended gametime during week fifteen, after the Bears had clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In a game against the Detroit Lions, Griese completed six of nine passes for 51 yards, which set up several game-winning Robbie Gould field goals. Smith called on Griese to relieve a struggling Grossman for the second half of the final regular season game against the Green Bay Packers. However, Griese did not fare a lot better, completing 5 of 15 passes for 124 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. While some Chicagoans questioned Grossman&#x27;s ability to lead the Bears to the Super Bowl, Smith stood by Grossman, and declared him the team&#x27;s starter throughout the playoffs. The Bears went on to win the 2006 NFC Championship, but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts.

After Grossman struggled during the first three outings of the 2007 Chicago Bears season, Smith turned to Griese to lead the team. In his first outing as a Bears starter, Griese threw two touchdowns and three interceptions in a losing effort against the Detroit Lions. The next week, he led the Bears on a game-winning drive against the Philadelphia Eagles, in which he called the plays due to a headset failure. Griese lost the starting job to Grossman after sustaining an injury against the Oakland Raiders during week ten. Griese again replaced Grossman later in the season, after Grossman sustained a knee injury against the Washington Redskins. However, with the Bears out of the playoffs, Kyle Orton started the remaining 3 games of the season.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers (second stint)===
On March 3, 2008, Griese was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a sixth round pick in the 2009 draft. He started the second game of the season, a home game against the Atlanta Falcons, which the Buccaneers won 24–9. Griese completed 18 of 31 passes, throwing for 160 yards with one touchdown. The next week, Griese played his old team, the Chicago Bears, and despite throwing 3 interceptions, he threw for 407 yards and 2 touchdowns to help the Buccaneers beat the Chicago Bears 27–24 in overtime. He also started the following week, and again despite throwing 3 interceptions, he completed 15 of 30 passes for 149 yards, 1 touchdown, and lead the Bucs to a victory over the Green Bay Packers 30–21. Griese started against the Atlanta Falcons again on December 14, 2008, subbing for Jeff Garcia who was sidelined with a calf injury. He completed 26 of 37 passes for 269 yards and threw 1 touchdown. But Griese also threw an interception and was sacked four times. The Bucs ended up losing the game in overtime 13–10. His career starting for Tampa Bay was 8–2. He was released on July 13, 2009. After his release, Griese decided to retire from football.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Broadcasting career==
From 2009 to 2020, Griese was employed by ESPN, working as an analyst on the network&#x27;s college football coverage. Griese also served as radio color commentator for 850 KOA (AM)&#x27;s coverage of Denver Broncos&#x27; football for the 2010 and 2011 seasons.

From 2020 to 2022, Griese joined the booth for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, working alongside Steve Levy and Louis Riddick.

==Coaching career==
===San Francisco 49ers===
On March 4, 2022, it was announced Griese was leaving &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; to become the quarterbacks coach for the San Francisco 49ers, replacing Rich Scangarello, who left to become the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Kentucky. He played quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2004 to 2005 when 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan was an offensive quality control coach, while also being drafted by Shanahan&#x27;s father Mike Shanahan while head coach of the Denver Broncos.

==Personal life==
Griese was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in an individualized concentration from Michigan in 1997.

Griese is founder and board president of Judi&#x27;s House, a children&#x27;s grief support center in Denver, Colorado. Brian&#x27;s mother, Judi Griese, succumbed to breast cancer when Brian was 12. The grieving process was hard for Brian, and so he established Judi&#x27;s House to serve grieving children in the Denver area.

He also helped establish what would become the Griese, Hutchinson and Woodson Champions for Children&#x27;s Hearts golf weekend in May 2007. The event benefited the capital campaign for construction of the C.S. Mott Children&#x27;s Hospital as well as the Michigan Congenital Heart Center (MCHC) which resides within Mott. He also remains involved with the From the Heart Organization, a relationship that dates back to his playing days in Ann Arbor when he would visit Mott every week.

For his work with Judi&#x27;s House, Griese was awarded the 2011 Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy, presented each year by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which celebrates and promotes the selfless service of people within the world of sports. He was named the recipient of the Big Ten&#x27;s Dungy-Thompson Humanitarian Award in 2014, and the Big Ten&#x27;s Ford-Kinnick Leadership Award in 2015, becoming the first individual to be recognized with both of the conference&#x27;s annual awards. These awards recognize Big Ten football players that have achieved success in the areas of leadership and humanitarianism after their college careers have ended.

Brian and his father, Bob Griese, became the first father-and-son duo in NFL history to both win a Super Bowl. Brian and his father wrote a book together, &quot;Undefeated&quot; (), published in 2000 about their lives through their undefeated seasons and living through the breast cancer illness and death of Brian&#x27;s mother and Bob&#x27;s first wife, Judi.

Griese married Brook McClintic, a clinical psychologist, in the spring of 2004 on the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The couple met while Griese was playing for the Denver Broncos. Brian and Brook have a daughter, Annalia Rose, and a son, Nathan.

An article was written in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; about Brooking&#x27;s motivational speeches. The article featured this speech from an earlier game:

Before the Washington game, as players gather around, Brooking screams, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna keep hitting &#x27;em, we&#x27;re gonna keep hitting &#x27;em!&quot; Players shout, &quot;Yeah!&quot; after both lines.

Brooking, wide-eyed and picking up speed, says, &quot;They might get back up. Then we&#x27;re gonna hit &#x27;em again! And when they&#x27;re barely hanging on ...&quot;

At this point Choice cuts in, &quot;What&#x27;re we gonna do?&quot;

Brooking concludes: &quot;We&#x27;re gonna hit &#x27;em in the mouth! We&#x27;re gonna bloody their nose! We&#x27;re gonna knock &#x27;em to the ground!&quot;
===Denver Broncos===

<doc id="1283426" wikidata="Q4511785" url="?curid=1283426" title="Chris Chandler (American football)">
<text>Christopher Mark Chandler (born October 12, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons. He played for seven different teams in eight different cities during his NFL career, and is known for leading the Atlanta Falcons to a 14–2 season in 1998 followed by an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII.

==Early life==
Chandler was born on October 12, 1965, in Everett, Washington, the ninth of ten children. His mother died when he was 19, and his father died shortly after he made it to the NFL. In high school, he was active in basketball, football, track and golf. As a high school quarterback, Chandler threw for 2,000 yards and 49 touchdowns.

==College career==
In college, Chandler played at the University of Washington from 1984 to 1987. He finished third in the school&#x27;s history in total offense with 4,442 yards and 32 touchdown passes, and ended his college career as the Offensive Player of the Game at the 1988 Senior Bowl. He graduated with an economics degree.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Chandler played in the NFL for 17 seasons, from 1988 to 2004. He played for eight teams (seven franchises as he played for Los Angeles Rams in their original city and later when they relocated to St. Louis), a record shared with Ryan Fitzpatrick, Mark Royals, Karl Wilson, and Jeff Brady, although Chandler and Fitzpatrick are the only two to have started for eight different teams. He threw for 28,484 yards, and had a career passer rating of 79.1. He has thrown at least one touchdown pass for seven different franchises, an NFL record before it was broken by Fitzpatrick in 2019. At the time of his retirement, he was ranked 30th in all-time pass completions, with 2328.

Chandler was continually bothered by injuries which earned him the moniker of &quot;Crystal Chandelier&quot; amongst his detractors. He also had the misfortune of &quot;always [being] the guy preceding the next great draft choice&quot; which made his career somewhat of a journeyman&#x27;s.

===1988–1996===
Chandler was taken in the third round of the 1988 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts, who added him to a roster with Jack Trudeau and Gary Hogeboom as the quarterback room. Chandler made spot appearances in two of the first three games of the season before being tapped to start Week 4 against the Miami Dolphins. He went 10-of-18 for 110 yards with an interception but the Colts won 15-13. Chanlder started the remaining twelve games of the regular season, with the Colts going 9-4; Chandler threw for 1,619 yards with eight touchdowns and twelve interceptions and a 67.2 passer rating while having just one game with more than 200 yards. Chander started the first three games of the 1989 season but did not play a single snap afterwards due to a knee injury suffered against Atlanta that knocked him out for the year; he threw two touchdowns to three interceptions on 537 passing yards combined for a 1-2 start. The Colts deemed Chandler expendable due to his poor play, and the fact that they selected Jeff George with the first overall choice in the 1990 draft. Chandler was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1990 for a 1st round draft choice that turned out to be the 2nd overall pick. The Colts also had the 1st pick the same year. The pick that they got for Chandler they used on Quentin Coryatt. Chandler was cut during the 1991 season. As a Buccaneer, he had an 0–6 record as a starter, threw for 5 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 44.9.

From 1992 to 1994 he played reasonably well as a starter and backup for the Phoenix Cardinals and the Los Angeles Rams. After joining the Houston Oilers in 1995, he would earn the starting job. His highlight with the team came on September 24, 1995, at Cincinnati. In the Oilers&#x27; 38–28 victory Chandler threw for 352 yards and 4 touchdowns, and earned a perfect passer rating of 158.3 after completing 23 of 26 passes. However, late in 1996, Jeff Fisher decided that Steve McNair was ready to start, and Chandler was traded to the Atlanta Falcons for a fourth-round draft choice.

===1997–2001===
Chandler&#x27;s best seasons were with Atlanta, when he was coached by Dan Reeves. The Falcon&#x27;s financial constraints meant that they could not sign an expensive big-name quarterback from free agency. Chandler was a Pro Bowl quarterback in 1997 and 1998. Reeves said Chandler &quot;makes decisions while backpedaling that other QBs can&#x27;t make until they settle into the pocket&quot; while other &quot;Coaches say he can speed-read defenses and anticipate his receivers well&quot;. In 1998, Chandler&#x27;s 9.65 yards-per-attempt figure was the highest single-season YPA of any quarterback in the 1990s with 300+ passing attempts, while he set career-bests in yardage and touchdowns and threw just 12 interceptions. The 1998 season saw Chandler lead the Falcons to a 14–2 record, winning their first playoff game in the Georgia Dome by overcoming the San Francisco 49ers and Steve Young 20–18 in the divisional round, and then capturing the NFC Championship conference title by upsetting the 15–1 Minnesota Vikings to make their inaugural appearance in the Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XXXIII, Chandler&#x27;s Falcons lost to the defending champions Denver Broncos quarterbacked by John Elway and coached by Mike Shanahan. Although Chandler had a higher passing efficiency rating that season than future Hall-of-Famer Elway, Chandler put in a disappointing performance in the Super Bowl with 219 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions while being sacked three times.

Chandler signed a five-year, $27 million contract with the Falcons after the Super Bowl. Following the 2000 season, Chandler&#x27;s record as a starting Atlanta quarterback was 28–25, which prompted the Falcons to consider recruiting a new quarterback. Atlanta held the fifth overall pick in the 2001 draft, and traded the pick to the San Diego Chargers, along with Tim Dwight, a third round pick in 2001, and a 2002 second round pick (which became Reche Caldwell). In return, Atlanta received the first overall pick in the 2001 draft, which they used to select quarterback Michael Vick. Still, Chandler started most of the 2001 season and finished with 2,847 passing yards, the second highest of his career. In 2002, he was replaced by Vick as the starting quarterback. Due to mediocre play, bloated salary, and being replaced by Vick, the Falcons opted to make Chandler eligible for selection by the Houston Texans in the 2002 Expansion Draft, with hopes of Chandler being picked up by the new team. Chandler left the Falcons ranked third in team history with 13,268 passing yards, but never achieved back-to-back winning seasons.

===2002–2004===
In 2002, Chandler was picked up by the Chicago Bears, and spent two seasons there before being released.

Chandler then agreed to a three-year $2.6 million contract to rejoin the Rams, to serve as a backup and mentor to Marc Bulger, who had recently displaced Kurt Warner as the starting quarterback. In Chandler&#x27;s first start as a Ram in 2004, he threw six interceptions, a team record. The following week, his poor play led to head coach Mike Martz saying, &quot;It is tragic that, that position [when played by Chandler] holds this team hostage.&quot;
As a result, Chandler was the first Ram to be released in the off-season, saving St. Louis $665,000 in cap space.

==Personal life==
Chandler lived in San Diego and was married to Diane Brodie, a former college tennis player at USC and daughter of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback John Brodie; they married in 1994. They have three daughters: Ryann, Skye, and Brynn. As Chandler&#x27;s mother Shirley died of breast cancer in 1984, and his father Forrest succumbed to lung cancer in 1991, Chandler has looked upon John Brodie and Jerry Rhome (who served as Chandler&#x27;s quarterback coach in Arizona and Houston) as surrogate fathers and mentors.

Chandler is a regular competitor at the American Century Championship, the annual competition to determine the best golfers among American sports and entertainment celebrities. He won the tournament in 2007 and has a total of eight top ten finishes. Chris Chandler fired a 5 under par round of 67 scoring a total of 31 points. The veteran QB set both single day and tournament records for points with his final round play. The tournament, televised by NBC in July, is played at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Lake Tahoe. Chandler helped coach the boys&#x27; golf team at Torrey Pines High School, where his oldest daughter Ryann plays on the volleyball team.

<doc id="1283437" wikidata="Q3478166" url="?curid=1283437" title="Selkirk (provincial electoral district)">
<text>Selkirk is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957 from part of St. Andrews, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1958. It is named after the city of Selkirk, which in turn was named for Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, who set up the Red River Colony colonization project in 1811.

== Division profile ==
Selkirk is bordered to the east by Lac Du Bonnet, to the south by Springfield, to the west by Gimli, and to the north by Lake Winnipeg. Most of the riding&#x27;s population is located in the city of Selkirk. Other communities in the riding include Belair and Grand Marais, and there is a significant amount of agricultural land in the riding as well.

=== Demographics ===
The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,409. In 1999, the average family income was $51,605, and the unemployment rate was 8.30%. Health and social services account for 16% of all industry in the riding.

Thirteen per cent of Selkirk&#x27;s residents are aboriginal, while 8% are Ukrainian and 6% German.

=== Political history ===
The riding was safe for the New Democratic Party from 1969 to 2016, although the Liberal Party held the seat from 1988 to 1990. Former Premier of Manitoba Howard Pawley represented Selkirk from 1969 to 1988. 

Current MLA Alan Lagimodiere, a Progressive Conservative, became the first member of his party to win the district when he won in 2016, defeating NDP MLA Greg Dewar. He did not seek reelection in the 2023 Manitoba general election.

<doc id="1283438" wikidata="Q16097097" url="?curid=1283438" title="Bruce Jacob">
<text>Bruce Robert Jacob (born March 26, 1935) is a former Assistant Attorney General for the State of Florida during the early 1960s. He represented Louie L. Wainwright, the Director of the Florida Division of Corrections, in the Supreme Court case of &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, decided in March 1963, regarding the right to counsel of indigent defendants in non-capital felony cases in state courts. The attorney representing the Petitioner, Clarence Gideon, was Abe Fortas, a Washington, D.C. lawyer who later became a Justice of the Supreme Court. The previous 1942 Supreme Court case of Betts v. Brady required the appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant at state expense if there was a “special circumstance” present in the case which made it necessary for counsel to be provided for the defendant to receive a fair trial. For example, if the defendant was indigent and was extremely young, or lacked education or experience, was unfamiliar with court procedures, or if the charges against him were complex, the trial court was required under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to appoint counsel. Jacob argued against any extension of the defendant&#x27;s right to counsel. The Court in Gideon overruled Betts and required state courts to appoint attorneys for defendants in all felony prosecutions.

Gideon had been convicted of breaking the Bay Harbor Poolroom, located in the small community of Bay Harbor, near Panama City, Florida. His conviction was set aside and the case was sent back to the trial court in Panama City for a new trial. At the second trial, he was represented by appointed attorney Fred Turner and Gideon was acquitted.

The decision in Gideon led to the establishment of many more public defender offices throughout the United States than had existed previously. Anthony Lewis wrote a book about the case, entitled &quot;Gideon’s Trumpet&quot;, published in 1964. In 1980 it was made into a movie of the same name, starring Henry Fonda as Clarence Gideon.

==Early life==
Bruce Jacob was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 26, 1935, and was raised in Hinsdale, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, when he was 16 and he graduated from Sarasota High School in 1953. During his senior year, he played the violin in the Florida West Coast Symphony. Also, he participated in football, basketball, and track, and in track was the 1953 Florida high school state champion in the half-mile run.

==College and legal education==
For his first year of college, he attended Principia College, in Elsah, Illinois, and there he lettered in basketball and track. Beginning his second year he transferred to Florida State University, where he lettered in track. Also, he played in the Florida State Symphony orchestra and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He received a B.A. degree from Florida State in 1957. He studied law at Stetson University College of Law, St. Petersburg, Florida, and received the J.D. degree in 1959. At Stetson, during his senior year, he was the president of the student body.

Later, during his career as a lawyer, law professor, and dean, he received an LL.M (Criminal Law) degree from Northwestern University in 1965; the S.J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1980; and an LL.M (Taxation) from the University of Florida in 1995.

==Legal career==
Jacob began his legal career in the Florida Attorney General’s office, in Tallahassee, in 1960 and there he represented the state in 19 appeals before the Florida Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal of Florida. In 1962 he joined the firm of Holland, Bevis, and Smith, in Bartow and Lakeland Florida as an associate. (That firm now is Holland and Knight, in various cities in the United States and other countries). From 1965 to 1969 Jacob was an Assistant and associate professor at the Emory University School of Law, in Atlanta, Georgia. As a graduate student at the Harvard Law School, from 1968 to 1971 he served as a research associate in the Center for Criminal Justice and as a staff attorney in the Community Legal Assistance Office, a Harvard legal services office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Jacob subsequently was associate professor, then Professor, and Director of Clinical Programs at the Ohio State University College of Law in Columbus, Ohio from 1971 to 1978. From 1978 to 1981 he was Dean and Professor of Law of the Mercer University School of Law, in Macon, Georgia. From 1981 to 1994 he was Vice President of Stetson University and Dean and Professor at the Stetson College of Law. From 1994, when he stepped down as Dean, until he retired in 2018, he was a professor of law at Stetson. Jacob presently is Dean Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of the Stetson University College of Law.

In 2009 Jacob assisted in teaching a course on International Organizations in Lucerne and Geneva, Switzerland. In 2010 he was a panelist in American law at the Northwest University of Politics and Law, Xi’an, China; Southwest University of Political Science and Law, Chongqing, China; Dalian Maritime University, Dalian City, Manchuria, China; and Tsinghua University, Beijing. In 2011 he was an instructor in the Program on American Law, sponsored by the Northwest University of Politics and Law, in Xi’an, China.

==Legal work for indigent defendants and prison inmates==
To comply with the Gideon decision, in May 1963, the Florida Legislature enacted a law creating a statewide public defender system and included was a provision allowing lawyers in private firms to become unpaid Special Assistant Public Defenders. Jacob, who by then was in private practice in Bartow, Florida, volunteered and was appointed to represent defendants in criminal cases under this statute.

In 1966, as assistant professor at Emory Law School, he established the Legal Assistance for Inmates (L.A.I.) The program, providing free legal help to indigent prisoners at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta. While acting as the director and supervisor of the students in that program he was appointed by the United States Supreme Court as counsel for the Petitioner in the case of &quot;Kaufman v. United States&quot;. The Supreme Court ruled with Jacob, who argued that his client had been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. A movie was made, in 1986, about Harold Kaufman following his release from prison. Its title is “A Deadly Business” and it starred Alan Arkin as Kaufman.

Jacob also represented inmates in appellate cases such as Rosa v United States, and in federal trial-level cases such as White v Blackwell and Lawrence v Blackwell challenging prison rules and practices on constitutional grounds. The Emory program and the National Defender Project entered into an experiment in which two jailhouse lawyers from the Atlanta Penitentiary who were knowledgeable about federal criminal law were released from confinement to assist in the work of the program. The National Defense Project, through Deputy Director John Cleary,
obtained the release of the two jailhouse lawyers and provided the funding to pay their salaries. They worked with students at the law school. One of these men, Benjamin Rayborn, later served for over 30 years as a highly respected paralegal at the office of the Federal Defender in San Diego, California.

While a graduate student at the Harvard Law School Jacob was the co-founder of the Prison Legal Assistance Project (P.L.A.P.), for Massachusetts prison inmates. This project was patterned after the Emory L.A.I. Program. Also, he was a staff attorney, supervising students at the Community Legal Assistance Office (C.L.A.O.), a legal service office operated by the Harvard Law School.

From 1971 to 1978, at The Ohio State University College of Law, he developed clinical programs and taught two of them – the Criminal Defense Clinic and the Criminal Appeals and Post-Conviction Remedies clinic. In these clinics, students represented indigent defendants and inmates under the supervision of Jacob and supervising attorneys.

While Dean and Professor at Mercer Law School and Stetson College of Law until he retired from Stetson, Jacob continued to provide legal help to indigent defendants and prison inmates.

==Honors and awards==
In 2006 the members of an American Inn of Court in Tampa honored Professor Jacob by naming their Inn the &quot;Bruce R. Jacob Criminal Appellate American Inn of Court.&quot; In 2016 the name became &quot;Bruce R. Jacob - Chris W. Altenbernd Criminal Appellate Inn of Court.&quot; He was a member of The Constitution Project&#x27;s &quot;Blue Ribbon Panel&quot; on indigent defense in the United States. In 2009 the panel issued its report, entitled &quot;Justice Denied: America&#x27;s Continuing Neglect of Our Constitutional Right to Counsel.&quot; In 2013 he was one of four persons presented with &quot;Constitutional Champion&quot; awards by the Constitution Project, in Washington, D.C. He received the 2013 &quot;Champion of Indigent Defense Award&quot; from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

<doc id="1283443" wikidata="Q7604518" url="?curid=1283443" title="Status Anxiety">
<text>Status Anxiety is a nonfiction book by Alain de Botton. It was first published in 2004 by Hamish Hamilton; subsequent publications have been by Penguin Books.

==Central thesis==
According to De Botton, &quot;status anxiety&quot; is a 21st-century phenomenon which is a result of capitalism, democracy, and an ostensibly egalitarian society, and is prevalent in countries where an inequality in income is evident. Status anxiety can be defined as the constant tension or fear of being perceived as &quot;unsuccessful&quot; by the society in materialistic terms. Today, every individual constantly tries to outsmart the others to climb up the social ladder. The effects of status anxiety can be impulse buying, status consumption etc.
Meritocracy is a primary cause of status anxiety. Meritocracy is a society that believes that only the talented and the meritorious will end up at the top of the social ladder. Snobbery, envy, lovelessness are some other causes of status anxiety.

De Botton first noticed this phenomenon among the wealthy families of America. The Americans had a lavish lifestyle and most of it was just to make the &quot;neighbours&quot; envious. America had also witnessed the trend of &quot;Famous for being famous&quot;. Botton even met the American motivational speaker Les Brown to know how motivational speaking works. He concluded that motivational speakers conducted their speeches to induce status anxiety among individuals. Motivational speaking is based on the fact that &quot;No one is living up to their true potential and everyone has scope for improvement&quot;. De Botton challenged this and asked &quot;What about those who want to achieve but lack the opportunities to do so?&quot;

De Botton lays out the causes of and solutions to status anxiety as follows:

Causes:
* Lovelessness
* Expectation
* Meritocracy
* Snobbery
* Dependence

Solutions:
* Philosophy
* Art
* Politics
* Religion
* Bohemianism

==Film==
A two-hour documentary film about this thesis, also called &quot;Status Anxiety&quot; and written by Alain de Botton, was released in 2004. A version of it was shown in 2008 on Public Broadcasting Service channels like Boston WGBH-TV&#x27;s digital channel WGBX-TV in the United States.

==Earlier uses of the term==

Historian Richard Hofstadter in his 1965 book &quot;The Paranoid Style in American Politics&quot; used the term &quot;status anxiety&quot; to help explain the origins of the Progressive Movement, following earlier usage by others. Alain de Botton&#x27;s use of the term is different.

<text>The Chickasaw language (, ) is a Native American language of the Muskogean family. It is agglutinative and follows the word order pattern of subject–object–verb (SOV). The language is closely related to, though perhaps not entirely mutually intelligible with, Choctaw. It is spoken by the Chickasaw tribe, now residing in Southeast Oklahoma, centered on Ada.

The language is currently spoken by around 50 people, mostly Chickasaw elders who grew up with the language. Due to boarding schools in the 20th century and Chickasaw removal from their homeland in the 19th century, the widespread knowledge about the language and culture amongst the nation has largely decreased. This being said, there are increasingly more accessible resources for teaching, learning, and preserving this and many other Native American languages, as of the year 2021. There is indeed growing interest in learning, teaching, and preserving this endangered language. The Chickasaw Nation has online resources for teaching this language that are of great utility.

==Classification==
Chickasaw, Choctaw and Houma form the Western branch of the Muskogean language family. The Chickasaw and Choctaw were once one tribe who similarly spoke the Muskogean languages. The Chickasaw language was widely spoken until 1970 but has since become an endangered language. Chickasaw is also related to Alabama, Koasati, Mvskoke (Creek)-Seminole, Hitchiti and Mikasuki.

==History==
Sometime prior to the first European contact, the Chickasaw migrated from western regions and moved east of the Mississippi River, where they settled mostly in present-day northeast Mississippi. Chickasaw towns and villages were structured to be densely populated as a wartime measure but encompassed larger areas when there was no conflict with enemies. A main house and main meeting ground were used to gather groups from the Chickasaw community for ceremonies, celebratory affairs, and to discuss important social, cultural, and political matters. There was a division and specialization in labor done by men who prepared the community for war, hunted for food, and made provisions for the defense of their communities while Chickasaw women were matriarchal leaders of their households who cared for crops, children, and estate matters. They would eventually come into contact with Europeans as time passed on and European exploration of their lands took shape. That is where they encountered European explorers and traders, having relationships with French, English and Spanish during the colonial years. The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes, as they adopted numerous practices of European Americans. Resisting European-American settlers encroaching on their territory, they were forced by the US to sell their country in 1832 and move to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) during the era of Indian Removal in the 1830s.

==Current status==

Emily Johnson Dickerson, the last monolingual speaker of Chickasaw, died on December 30, 2013. Ethnologue estimated in its seventeenth edition that Chickasaw retained up to 600 speakers, but noted that this figure was rapidly declining because most speakers are 50 and older. Children are no longer acquiring the language, indicating Chickasaw has a notably low vitality. As of 2014, there were &quot;four to five confident conversational speakers who are under the age of 35.&quot; The Chickasaw language is not much used outside of the home. In terms of conservation and language vitality, Ethnologue evaluates the current language situation as moribund, and UNESCO lists Chickasaw as a &quot;severely endangered&quot; language, also noting that most of the ~50 speakers (as of 2019) are over fifty and almost all are bilingual in English.

=== Language revitalization ===
The Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program, founded in 2007, uses both Munro-Willmond and Humes alphabets. Because Chickasaw is a spoken language, &quot;there is no &#x27;right&#x27; or &#x27;wrong&#x27; way to spell Chickasaw.&quot; Chickasaw is taught through a master-apprentice program, community programs, and self-study programs.

A &quot;Chickasaw Language Basic&quot; app is available for iPhone, iPad, and other iOS devices.

In a collaboration with Apple, Inc., the Chickasaw language keyboard layout is available in iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4 and macOS Ventura 13.3 and later to help users type with &quot;special characters for pitch accent, nasal vowels and the glottal stop character.&quot;

===Classes and programs===
The Chickasaw Nation has a department of Chickasaw Language with a 24-member Chickasaw Language Committee. In 2007, the tribe founded the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program. Four levels of Chickasaw language classes are taught at East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma. Joshua D. Hinson (called &quot;Lokosh,&quot; meaning gourd, in the language), director of the Chickasaw Language Committee developed master-apprenticeship programs with guidance from linguist Leanne Hinton.

&quot;Chipota Chikashshanompoli&quot; is a children&#x27;s language program that meets monthly. Ada, Ardmore, Norman, Purcell, Sulphur, and Tishomingo all host non-academic adult language classes. The tribe also organizes immersion camps and publishes Chickasaw language literature through the Chickasaw Press.
More recently, the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program has been working with Rosetta Stone and Ackerman McQueen, releasing a video series teaching learners how to speak Chickasaw with the Rosetta Stone Advanced Languages software.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Chickasaw has 16 consonants. In the table below, the consonants are written in the standard Chickasaw orthography. The phonetic symbolization of each consonant is written in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to the right of each orthographic letter when the orthography differs from the IPA symbol.

* is labiovelar.
* Voiceless stops have a small amount of aspiration , especially at the beginning of words.
* The voiced stop may undergo lenition to a voiced fricative between vowels.
* All consonants except for the glottal stop may be geminated and most consonants can occur in biconsonantal clusters.

===Vowels===

Chickasaw has 9 vowels:

Chickasaw vowels contrast between short and long oral vowels and between long oral vowels and long nasal vowels. Short vowels are centralized (see chart): short &quot;i&quot; is phonetically , short &quot;o&quot; is phonetically , and short &quot;a&quot; is phonetically .

Short vowels are also phonetically lengthened when they occur in the second syllable of a sequence of even-numbered open syllables. For example, the word &quot;pisali&quot; (&#x27;I took him&#x27;) is phonetically . The lengthened short vowel is usually intermediate in length between a short vowel and long vowel. However, the phonetic realization varies depending on the individual speaker and also on phonetic environment. The lengthening does not occur at the end of words and is further restricted by certain morphological criteria.

==Grammar==

===Verb===

====Pronominal affixes====

Verb arguments (i.e. subject, direct object, indirect object) are indicated with pronominal affixes (both prefixes and suffixes) which are added to verb stems. The pronominal affixes are inflected according to number (singular, plural) and person (1st, 2nd).

Chickasaw has an active–stative pronominal system with two basic series of pronominal sets: an active series (I) and a stative series (II). Additionally, Chickasaw also has dative (III), negative (N), and reciprocal (IR) series.

The active series is used for active intransitive subjects and active transitive subjects. (An &quot;active&quot; subject, simply put, is a subject that is in control of the action while a &quot;stative&quot; subject does not have control of the action. This is the difference between &quot;She fell on purpose&quot; vs. &quot;She fell accidentally&quot; where the first &quot;she&quot; controlled the falling while the second &quot;she&quot; did not control the falling.) The active series is in the table below:

The third person lacks an affix and usually does not distinguish between singular and plural. The first person singular affix is a suffix while the other affixes are prefixes. The first person plural has two forms: &quot;il-&quot; which is used before vowels and &quot;ii-&quot; which is used before consonants — thus, &quot;il-iyya&quot; &quot;we go&quot;, &quot;ii-malli&quot; &quot;we jump&quot;. An example inflectional paradigm of the verb &quot;malli&quot; &quot;to jump&quot; is below (with the pronominal affixes underlined):

The stative series (II) is below. This series is used to indicate stative intransitive subjects and direct objects.

Example with stative intransitive subjects, &quot;lhinko&quot; &quot;to be fat&quot;:

Example with direct objects, &quot;pisa&quot; &quot;to look at (someone)&quot; (the subject in the paradigm below is unmarked because it is in the third person):

Both active and stative affixes can occur together in which case the active affix indicates the active subject and the stative affix indicates the direct object. Active prefixes occur before stative prefixes. When &quot;ish-&quot; &quot;active second person singular&quot; occurs before &quot;sa-&quot; &quot;stative first person singular&quot;, it results in &quot;issa-&quot; (the &quot;sh&quot; assimilates to &quot;s&quot;). Likewise, &quot;hash-&quot; &quot;active second person plural&quot; + &quot;sa-&quot; is realized as &quot;hassa-&quot;. The full paradigm of &quot;pisa&quot; &quot;to look at&quot; is below:

<doc id="1283447" wikidata="Q13403557" url="?curid=1283447" title="Halter">
<text>A halter or headcollar is headgear placed on animals used to lead or tie up livestock and, occasionally, other animals; it fits behind the ears (behind the poll), and around the muzzle. To handle the animal, usually a lead rope is attached. On smaller animals, such as dogs, a leash is attached to the halter.

== History ==

Halters may be as old as the early domestication of animals, and their history is not as well studied as that of the bridle or hackamore. The word &quot;halter&quot; derives from the Germanic words meaning &quot;that by which anything is held.&quot;

One halter design was patented in the United States by Henry Wagner of Toledo, Iowa February 13, 1894.

== Uses ==

A halter is used to control an animal when leading on the ground, and as a restraint when tying them up. It is used on many different types of livestock. Halters are most closely associated with Equidae such as horses, donkeys, and mules. However, they are also used on farm animals such as cattle and goats and other working animals such as camels, llamas, and yaks. Halters generally are not used on elephants or on predators, though there are halters made for dogs.

Halters are often plain in design, used as working equipment on a daily basis. In addition to the halter, a lead line, lead shank or lead rope is required to actually lead or tie the animal. It is most often attached to the halter at a point under the jaw, or less often, at the cheek, usually with a snap, but occasionally spliced directly onto the halter. A standard working lead rope is approximately long.

Specially designed halters, sometimes highly decorated, are used for in-hand or &quot;halter&quot; classes at horse shows and in other livestock shows. When an animal is shown in an exhibition, the show halter is fitted more closely than a working halter and may have a lead shank that tightens on the head so that commands from the handler may be more discreetly transmitted by means of the leadline. A shank that tightens on the animal&#x27;s head when pulled is not used for tying the animal.

Halters are designed to catch, hold, lead and tie animals, and nothing else. However, some people ride horses using a halter instead of a bridle. In most cases, it is not safe to ride in an ordinary stable halter because it fits loosely and provides no leverage to the rider should a horse panic or bolt. It is particularly unsafe if the lead rope is used as a single rein, attached to the leading ring under the jaw. In some cases, mecate-style reins may be added to a rope halter, creating a modified form of hackamore, and equipment called a &quot;sidepull&quot; has a heavier noseband and two reins added on cheek rings placed each side to provide control.

== Designs ==

Halters may be classified into two broad categories, depending on whether the material used is flat or round. Materials used include leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Fibers may be woven into flat webbing or twisted into round rope. Flat or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles and rings at attachment points; round materials are knotted or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope. 

The rope halter, occasionally called a &quot;cowboy halter&quot;, is associated with the western riding tradition, popularized with the wave of interest in natural horsemanship. It is called an &quot;American halter&quot; in France. or an &quot;ethological halter&quot; , literally a &quot;halter with knots&quot;. In German, it is called a .

Show halters may be flat or round, but are generally made of leather or a similar synthetic and are designed to enhance the attractiveness of an animal&#x27;s head as well as to exert precise control.

== Horse halters ==

Horse halters are sometimes confused with a bridle or a hackamore. The primary difference between a halter and a bridle is that a halter is used by a handler on the ground to lead or tie up an animal, but a bridle or hackamore is generally used by a person who is riding or driving an animal that has been trained in this use. A halter is safer for tying, as the bit of a bridle or the heavier noseband of a hackamore may injure the horse if the horse sets back while tied. In addition, bridles and hackamores are usually made of lighter materials and will break. In some cases, a bridle or hackamore may be used when handling an equine on the ground in order to exert more precision and control. 

One common halter design is made of either flat nylon webbing or flat leather, has a noseband that passes around the muzzle with one ring under the jaw, usually used to attach a lead rope, and two rings on either side of the head. The noseband is usually adjusted to lie about halfway between the end of the cheekbones and the corners of the mouth, crossing over the strong, bony part of the face. The noseband connects to a cheekpiece on either side that go up next to the cheekbone to meet with a ring on either side that usually is placed just above the level of the eye. These rings meet the throatlatch and the crownpiece. The crownpiece is a long strap on the right-hand side of the halter that goes up behind the ears, over the poll and is buckled to a shorter strap coming up from the left. The throatlatch goes under the throat, and sometimes has a snap or clip that allows the halter to be removed in a manner similar to the bridle. Many halters have another short strap connecting the noseband and the throatlatch.

The halter design made of rope also has the same basic sections, but usually is joined by knots instead of sewn into rings. Most designs have no metal parts, other than, in some cases, a metal ring under the jaw where the lead rope snaps, or, occasionally, a recessed hook attachment where the crownpiece can be connected. However, in many cases, a loop is formed in the left side of the crownpiece and the right side of the crownpiece simply is brought over the horse&#x27;s head, through the loop and tied with a sheet bend.

===Accessories===

To lead or tie an animal a lead rope or leash is used. The lead is attached to the halter most often at a point under the jaw, less often at the cheek, and less often, over the nose. On horses, a lighter version of a headcollar or headstall is also used to attach a fly veil of waxed cotton strands or light leather strips onto a browband. Some fly masks are also made in a similar pattern to a headcollar and are often fastened with velcro tabs. These masks may also have ear and nose protection added to them. On both horses and dogs, halters may be used to attach a muzzle.

== Safety and security issues ==

For tying, it is disputed if a halter should be made strong enough not to break under stress, or if it should give way when tension reaches a certain point in order to prevent injury to the animal. Usually the issue is of minimal concern if a tied animal is attended and the lead rope is tied with a slip knot that can be quickly released if the animal panics. However, in cases where a non-slip knot is tied, or if a soft rope is drawn tight and the knot cannot be released, or if the animal is left unsupervised, an animal panicking and attempting to escape can be seriously injured. Those who argue that the risk of injury is more of a concern than the risk of escape recommend halter designs that incorporate breakaway elements, such as a leather crownpiece, breakaway buckles, or easily detachable lead rope. Those who believe that escape is the greater danger, either due to concerns about escape or creating a recurring bad habit in an animal that learns to break loose that could become unable to be kept tied at all, recommend sturdy designs that will not break unless the handler deliberately releases a slipknot or cuts the lead rope. Between the two camps are those who recommend sturdy halters that will not break under normal pressure from a momentarily recalcitrant or frightened animal, but ultimately will break in a true panic situation, such as a fall.

Some users have the animal wear a halter at all times, even when stalled or turned out. Others have the animal wear a halter only when being led, held, or tied. The advantages of leaving a halter on are that the animal is often easier to catch. The disadvantages are that an animal may catch the halter on an object and become trapped or injured in some fashion. While experts advise leaving halters off when animals are turned out, if halters are left on unattended animals, breakaway designs that still will hold for everyday leading are recommended.

<text>An ice resurfacer is a vehicle or hand-pushed device for cleaning and smoothing the surface of a sheet of ice, usually in an ice rink. The first ice resurfacer was developed by American inventor and engineer Frank Zamboni in 1949 in Paramount, California. As such, an ice resurfacer is often referred to as a &quot;Zamboni&quot; as a genericized trademark.

==History==

The first ice resurfacer was invented by Frank Zamboni, who was originally in the refrigeration business. He created a plant for making ice blocks that could be used in refrigeration applications. As the demand for ice blocks waned with the spread of compressor-based refrigeration, he looked for another way to capitalize on his expertise in ice production.

In 1939 Zamboni built the Iceland skating rink in Paramount, California. To resurface the skating rink, three or four workers had to scrape, wash, and squeegee the ice. A thin layer of water was then added for the fresh ice. This process was extremely time-consuming, and Zamboni wanted to find a more efficient way to resurface the ice.

Between 1942 and 1947, he dedicated his efforts to creating a vehicle that would reduce the time needed for resurfacing. In 1947 he built a machine that could shave, wash and squeegee the ice. This machine was mounted on an army surplus Willys jeep chassis. A blade was mounted on the machine, which shaved the ice; the ice then received a thin layer of water, creating a smooth sheet of ice. The prototype had a tank that held the ice shavings, which were carried to the tank via a conveyor belt. Zamboni abandoned this model in late 1947 because of deficiencies with the blade and handling.

A new machine was developed using another army surplus vehicle chassis. This machine had four-wheel drive and all-wheel steering. By 1949 the Model A Zamboni Ice Resurfacer was developed. Further modification to the Model A included the addition of a wash water tank and a cover for the snow-holding tank (for ice shavings). The all-wheel steering feature was reduced to only front-wheel steering because the machine constantly got wedged against the boards. The Zamboni ice-resurfacer was patented in 1953.

The Model B was the next ice resurfacer made by Zamboni. The Zamboni Model C was also built on the same frame, but more design changes were applied. The driver&#x27;s position was raised for better visibility, and the capacity of the snow-holding tank was increased. From the late 1950s to 1964, there were minimal changes in how the ice-resurfacers were designed. The introduction of the HD series in 1964 saw a shift in the design of the Zamboni ice resurfacers. Instead of relying on a conveyor belt system to move the ice shavings into the snow-holding tank, a vertical screw conveyor system was installed, and a new hydraulic snow-dumping system was adopted. This design has been the industry standard since it was first adopted.

In 1967, an Elmira, Ontario-based welder named Andrew Schlupp founded the Resurfice Corporation and began producing competing models of resurfacers, including their popular Olympia line. In 1980 an Italian company, Engo Ice Arena Equipment, began producing ice resurfacers.

== Technology ==
Ice resurfacers are generally composed of a snow container, hot water tanks, a wash water tank, the conditioner, and a board brush. An internal combustion engine or electric motor of the vehicle is responsible both for propelling the resurfacer and also powering the hydraulics that control the various functions, such as lowering the conditioner or raising the snow dump.

Most of the actual resurfacing components are contained in a heavy device at the rear of the machine, known as the &quot;conditioner&quot;. The conditioner is hydraulically lowered to the ice surface, its weight providing the friction necessary for a large, sharp blade (similar to those used in industrial paper cutters) to shave off the top layer of ice. A horizontal auger conveyor collects these ice shavings, or snow, and funnels them to a vertical auger at the center of the conditioner. The shavings are then carried upward and sprayed into a large snow container, which takes up most of the volume of the resurfacer.

The height of the blade can be adjusted by the driver, allowing deeper or shallower cuts. This is useful for keeping the ice sheet level, improving the quality of the cut, and preventing the snow container from overflowing.

Wash water can be used to further improve the quality of the ice by removing debris and snow from deep skate-blade cuts. Located directly in front of the blade, nozzles forcefully spray water into the ice surface, loosening deep debris. Runners on either side of the conditioner contain the spray, while a rubber squeegee at the rear of the conditioner allows a vacuum nozzle to pick up excess water. This water is then filtered through a screen and recirculated.
Finally, a layer of water is laid down to fill in the remaining grooves in the ice. The ice-making water is released through a sprinkler pipe at the rear of the conditioner, which wets the cloth towel that is dragged behind the resurfacer. The towel ensures a smooth, controlled deposition of water.

Traditionally, hot water has been used because it slightly melts the layer of ice below it, leading some operators to believe it forms a stronger bond during the freezing process because heating the water releases dissolved gases thus allowing the ice to freeze in a clearer state. It is also sometimes believed that warm water reduces the freezing time of the water due to the unproven Mpemba effect. The water used in some rinks is also filtered and treated before being used in the ice resurfacer to remove any minerals or chemicals in the water. These impurities can otherwise make the ice brittle, soft, give it undesirable odors, or change the color and clarity.

Many ice resurfacers are fitted with a &quot;board brush&quot;, a rotary brush powered by a hydraulic motor. The board brush is extended and retracted on the left side of the machine by a hydraulic arm. This allows the operator to collect ice shavings and debris that accumulate along the edge of the rink (along the kick plates below the dasher boards of the rink) where the conditioner cannot easily reach. The brush sweeps the accumulations into the path of the conditioner, which removes them from the ice. The use of a board brush can dramatically reduce the need for edging of the rink. After resurfacing the entire sheet, also known as an &quot;ice cut&quot; or &quot;flood&quot;, the snow container must be emptied. Hydraulics raise one end of the container, causing the snow to spill out.

Smaller, cheaper machines have also been designed to provide a smooth ice surface in a manner similar to a traditional resurfacer. These can be either self-propelled or pushed/pulled by the operator. Self-propelled vehicles typically incorporate the main components of full-size ice resurfacer, including a blade and water tank, but on a smaller scale. These are usually mounted to an ATV or golf cart-like vehicle.

== Ice edgers ==

The ice around the edges of a rink has a tendency to build up because the conditioner blade does not extend all the way to the outer edges of the conditioner and it is unwise to &quot;ride&quot; (drive with the conditioner touching) the dasher boards. An ice edger is a small device similar to a rotary lawn mower that is used to shave down the edges of the ice surface that the ice resurfacer cannot cut. An ice edger cannot shave ice that has an overall bowl or mushroom shape.
Drivers using latest model ice resurfacing equipment can effectively cut ice edges within millimeters of the dasher board.

== Driving under the influence ==
Jurisdictions differ over whether operating an ice resurfacer while drunk counts as illegal driving under the influence. A Zamboni driver in North Dakota has served jail time for driving a Zamboni drunk, but a New Jersey judge ruled that driving a Zamboni does not count as DUI.

== In popular culture ==
* Starting in 1980, Charles M. Schulz incorporated Zambonis into his &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip as well as into the 1980 television special &quot;She&#x27;s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown&quot;, increasing public awareness of them.
* In the 1981 James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Bond uses a Zamboni to dispatch an attacker during a fight on an ice rink.
* In the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, the character Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas) is killed by a Zamboni in the episode &quot;Death Takes a Holiday on Ice&quot; (1989). Ken Levine, who co-wrote the episode, recalled, &quot;We were worried that we wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the name Zamboni but the company loved it.&quot;
* The term &quot;Zamboni&quot; got a further boost in popular recognition from the 1992 Winter Olympics, when skater Laëtitia Hubert fell so many times she was nicknamed the &quot;Human Zamboni&quot;, and the usage of the term &quot;Zamboni&quot; in its general sense subsequently expanded by an order of magnitude.
* The 2009 video game &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot; features a zombie opponent called &quot;Zomboni&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;zombie&quot; and &quot;Zamboni&quot;) which pilots a Zamboni to destroy plants on contact, leaving an ice trail that prevents further planting and allows for Bobsled Zombies to slide onto the lawn.
* On January 16, 2013, in honor of Frank Zamboni&#x27;s 112th birthday, Google published a Google Doodle dedicated to him. The doodle is a game where the player can clean the surface of a virtual ice rink using an ice resurfacer.
* In the 2014 film &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot;, the protagonists, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey), reach El Paso on a Zamboni that they stole from an ice rink.
* In the 2016 film &quot;Deadpool&quot;, the titular character uses a Zamboni to run over a heavily injured opponent as an act of vengeance.
* On February 22, 2020, David Ayres, the operations manager at the Mattamy Athletic Centre, entered the game as the emergency backup goalie for the NHL&#x27;s Carolina Hurricanes, leading them to a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs and consequently becoming the first and only emergency backup goaltender (EBUG) to record a win in National Hockey League history. Ayres was referred to as a &quot;Zamboni driver&quot; in news articles about his NHL debut.

<text>Prince of Antioch was the title given during the Middle Ages to Norman rulers of the Principality of Antioch, a region surrounding the city of Antioch, now known as Antakya in Turkey. The Princes originally came from the County of Sicily in Southern Italy. After 1130 and until 1816 this county was known as the Kingdom of Sicily. Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch additionally came into possession of the County of Tripoli, combining these two Crusader states for the rest of their histories.

Antioch had been the chief city of the region since the time of the Roman Empire. When the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt drove out the knights in 1268, they largely destroyed the city to deny access to the region in case the Crusaders returned.

==Rulers of Antioch, 1098–1268==

==Titular rulers of Antioch 1268–1457==

==Vassals of Antioch==

===Lords of Saône===

The Lordship of Saône was centered on the castle of Saône, but included the towns of Sarmada (lost in 1134) and Balatanos. Saône was captured by Saladin from the last lord, Matthew, in 1188.

* Robert &quot;the Leprous&quot; (d. 1119)
* William (1119–1132)
* Matthew (1132-1188)

==Great Officers of Antioch==
Like Jerusalem, Antioch had its share of great officers, including Constable, Marshal, Seneschal, Duc, Vicomte, Butler, Chamberlain, and Chancellor.

<doc id="1283475" wikidata="Q7314725" url="?curid=1283475" title="Republicanism in Canada">
<text>Canadian republicanism is a movement for the replacement of the monarchy of Canada and a monarch as head of state with a parliamentary republic and a democratically-selected Canadian as head of state. Republicans are driven by various factors, such as a perception of inequality in the concept of excluding all but members of the royal family from the position or the argument that Canadian independence will not be achieved until Canadians can choose their own head of state independently and democratically.

As with monarchism in Canada, strong republicanism is not a prevalent element of contemporary Canadian society. The movement&#x27;s roots precede Canadian Confederation and it has emerged from time to time in Canadian politics, but has not been an influential force since the Rebellions of 1837, which some Canadian republicans consider their efforts to be a continuation of.

==National identity==
Republicans in Canada assert that because of its hereditary aspects, the monarchy is inherently contrary to egalitarianism and multiculturalism. Further, though it diverges from both the official position of the Canadian government and the opinions of some judges, legal scholars, and members of the royal family themselves, republicans deem the King or Queen of Canada to be either a solely British or English individual representing a British institution foreign to Canada. Founded on this perception is the republican assertion that national pride is diminished by the monarchy, and it &quot;prolongs a sense that Canada &quot;is a colony&quot; and is &quot;subservient to Britain.&quot;

This questioning of the monarchy&#x27;s role in Canadian identity arose as a part of wider cultural changes that followed the evolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations, the rise of anti-establishmentism, the creation of multiculturalism as an official policy in Canada, and the blossoming of Quebec separatism; the latter becoming the major impetus of political controversy around the Crown. Quebec nationalists agitated for an independent Quebec republic and the monarchy was targeted as a symbol of anti-Anglophone demonstration, notably Quebecers turned their backs on her procession when she toured Quebec City that year. In a 1970 speech to the Empire Club of Canada, Governor General Roland Michener summed up the contemporary arguments against the Crown: From its opponents, he said, came the claims that monarchies are unfashionable, republics—other than those with oppressive regimes—offer more freedom, people are given greater dignity from choosing their head of state, the monarchy is foreign and incompatible with Canada&#x27;s multicultural society, and that there should be change for the sake of change alone. This fits into the argument that the monarchy is not representative of the people of its countries. This has been argued to be the case with Canada having a head of state that is of a foreign nationality and living in another country.

However, though it was later thought the Quiet Revolution and the period beyond should have inspired more republicanism amongst Canadians, they did not. Reg Whitaker blamed this on a combination of Quebec nationalists having no interest in the monarchy (as full sovereignty and their own form of government was their ultimate goal) with the remainder of the population simultaneously struggling with &quot;bilingualism, dualism, special status, distinct society, asymmetrical federalism, sovereignty-association, partnership, and so on.&quot; Even the rise in multi-ethnic immigration to Canada in the 1970s did not inspire any desires to alter or remove the role of the Crown in Canada, the ethno-cultural groups not wanting to push constitutional change over a matter they had little concern for.

Instead, until the appointment of Stephen Harper as prime minister, successive governments made subtle efforts to diminish the stature of the Canadian monarchy—as David Smith said: &quot;the historic Crown with its anthem, emblems, and symbolism made accessible a past the government of the day rejected&quot;—though never, since the reaction to some of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s proposals for alterations to the monarchy and its role in Canada, publicly revealing their stances on the Crown. Following Elizabeth II&#x27;s death in September 2022, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly expressed support for the monarchy&#x27;s continued status in Canada.

== Challenges with transitioning to a republic ==
There are significant cultural, legal and constitutional challenges, due to the unique nature and structure of the Canadian state, in regards to in transitioning to a republic, and has been described by political and constitutional law experts as &quot;very difficult&quot; and &quot;virtually impossible,&quot; for Canada to become a republic and remove the Monarch as head of state.

In order for Canada to become a republic a constitutional amendment &quot;by unanimous consent&quot; outlined by Part V section 41, sub-section A, of the Canadian Constitution Act 1982, which outlines that any changes to the Monarch&#x27;s position requires a constitutional amendment by unanimous consent, for this to take place the House of Commons as well as the Senate and all 10 of the provincial legislatures would need to vote overwhelmingly for an amendment to remove or amend the role of Canadian Monarch. Experts argue that this would require a vast amount of political capital to even be possible, which despite a somewhat large republican sentiment in the country, does not presently exist and the issue is not viewed as a pressing concern, with the leaders of the two largest parties the Liberal Party and the Conservatives, as of 2024, publicly supportive of keeping the monarchy. As well as instances such as a Bloc Québécois led republican motion in the House of Commons in 2024 to remove the mention of the King in the parliamentary Oath which was voted down and defeated. Both constitutional and political challenges would need to be overcome by a republican movement in order for Canada to remove the monarchy, political and legal experts have stated they &quot;don&#x27;t see this happening anytime soon.&quot;

Another challenge that also often arises in discussion over the transition to a republic is the treaties and relations with the First Nations and other indigenous peoples of Canada. Many treaties that have been signed with the indigenous people of Canada were done so between the Crown and the indigenous peoples of Canada, not between the government and the indigenous peoples. This has been reflected in subsequent Supreme Court Rulings such as Haida Nation v. B.C. (Minister of Forests), 2004, which reinforced that any dealings by the government with indigenous peoples pursuant to the treaties is done so in the name of the Crown, and instructs that the government always must consider the &quot;honour of the Crown&quot; when dealing with indigenous peoples as such requires officials to act with honour, respect and dignity toward indigenous peoples. The entrenchment of the Crown in these matters has led to some scholars questioning the legal implications if Canada removed the Crown could have on the indigenous treaties, Though it is broadly accepted that the treaties would have to be carried forward into a republic due to in part the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, however some argue that international law lacks the executive power needed to do so. Most experts think consultation with Indigenous peoples on removing the Monarchy should take place prior to any plans for a transition to a republic.

Other challenges that are often raised in discussion of transitioning to a republic include, the financial cost that would have to be overcome, associated with removing the monarchy, including changing many Official Canadian National Symbols, which are widespread across public buildings, institutions and documents such as passports, changing the appearance of the Canadian dollar, changing the names, insignia, uniforms and rank insignia of the Canadian Armed Forces and Police Forces, as well as the cost of establishing a new republican form of government, amongst others. While some of these costs could arguably be offset in part by the money that is currently spent on the running of the Monarchy in Canada, the Governor General, and Lieutenant Governors (estimated at $58.7 million per year or $1.55 per Canadian Taxpayer,) it is broadly accepted that there would still be a substantial financial cost that would have to be overcome in order to change from Monarchy to Republic.

==Democratic principles and governmental role==
Canadian republicans view their country&#x27;s monarchy as &quot;outdated and irrelevant&quot; and an undemocratic institution because the incumbent sovereign is neither elected, nor a citizen once on the throne; republicans will phrase this argument as &quot;no Canadian citizen can become head of state.&quot;

In contrast to monarchist arguments, those against the Crown assert that it is possible to have an elected head of state be an apolitical individual and there would be no possibility of a clash with the prime minister over differences in political persuasion, though some republicans do desire an empowered chief executive who could hold the Cabinet in check for political reasons. Others feel an appointed Canadian president would be more democratic than the Crown. The range of often contradictory proposals highlights the fact that Canadian republicans are not fully united on what sort of republican form of government they believe the nation should adopt. The Westminster-style parliamentary republican model, which is advocated by other Commonwealth republican movements, has been embraced by Citizens for a Canadian Republic as the preferred model for Canada.
Towards that end, Citizens for a Canadian Republic proposed in March 2004 that the federal viceroy be made an elected position as a first step towards some form of republic. As the normal channels of appointment would follow after the election, no constitutional reform would be necessary. However, as monarchists point out, the scheme does not take into consideration any provincial input, especially concerning the relationship between the provincial and federal crowns and thus the lieutenant governors; an issue that would weigh heavily in any constitutional debate on the Crown, regardless of the selection process of the governor general. Further, a 2013 ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada disallowed similar consultative elections for senators, stating that such would be a change to how senators are selected and would thus require a constitutional amendment.

==History of issue==

===Colonial era and Confederation===

Reformists began to emerge in the Canadian colonies during the early 19th century and by two decades into that century had begun to cohere into organized groups, such as the Upper Canada Central Political Union. The idea of political party was viewed by a number of British North Americans as an innovation of the United States, being &quot;anti-British and of a republican tendency.&quot; Colonists were warned about &quot;a few individuals, who unfortunately, are led by those, whose hostility to the British constitution is such, that they would sacrifice any and every thing to pull it down, in order that they might build up a Republic on its ruins.&quot; It was believed that the persons agitating for republican change and their supporters were of American origin and had been taught to admire republican government as the best in the world and ridicule monarchism.
The first open uprisings in Canada against the monarchical system came in 1837, with the Lower Canada Rebellion—led by Louis Joseph Papineau and his Parti Patriote—and the Upper Canada Rebellion—led by William Lyon Mackenzie. Though their main motives were for more representative government in their respective colonies, Mackenzie was inspired by the American model and wished to establish the same in Canada. Papineau originally expressed loyalty to the Crown in his Ninety-Two Resolutions, but turned when the British parliament instead adopted the Earl Russell&#x27;s Ten Resolutions, which ignored all 92 of the requests from the Parti Patriote. Most colonists, however, did not espouse a break with the Crown and the rebellions ultimately failed. Mackenzie fled Toronto with 200 supporters and established, with the help of American sympathizers, the short-lived and never recognized Republic of Canada on Navy Island, while Papineau and other insurgents fled to the United States and proclaimed the Republic of Lower Canada.

After living in the US in order to avoid arrest in Canada, Mackenzie eventually became dissatisfied with the American republican system and gave up plans for revolution in the British North American provinces, though he theorized, near the end of his life, on Canadian annexation into the United States, should enough people in the former country become disillusioned with responsible government. Similarly, by 1849, Papineau was advocating the absorption of the Province of Canada (formed in 1840) into the American republic to the south. He echoed a significant minority of conservatives in Upper Canada who critiqued Canada&#x27;s imitation of the British parliamentary constitutional monarchy as both too democratic and too tyrannical, theorizing that it simultaneously destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and legislative council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. Instead, these &quot;republican conservatives&quot; preferred the American federal-state system and the US constitution, seeing the American model of checks and balances as offering Canada a more fair and conservative form of democracy. They debated constitutional changes that included an elected governor, an elected legislative council, and a possible union with the US, within this republican framework.
Some decades later, in 1869, a rebellion in the Red River area of Rupert&#x27;s Land erupted under the leadership of Louis Riel, who established in the Red River settlement a provisional government under John Bruce as president, with the intent of negotiating a provincial relationship with the federal government of Canada. As negotiations proceeded, Riel was eventually elected as president by the provisional government&#x27;s council. His delegation to Ottawa was eventually successful in having the federal Crown-in-Council in 1870 found the province of Manitoba with the same parliamentary constitutional monarchy as existed in the other provinces.

===Post-Quebec sovereignty movement===
The Parti Québécois rose to power in Quebec on the support of nationalists, with views towards the monarchy that ranged from hostility to indifference. In February 1968, during a constitutional conference in Ottawa, delegates from the Union Nationale-governed Quebec indicated that a provincial president might suit the province better than the appointed viceroy. Two years later, Parti Québécois (PQ) members of the National Assembly refused to recite the constitutionally mandated Oath of Allegiance to the sovereign before taking their seats in the legislature. Sovereignists protested against the Queen&#x27;s role in officially opening the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with René Lévesque asking Elizabeth to refuse the advice from Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and not open the games. Republican options were discussed following the election of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois to government in Quebec, but only specifically in relation to the province.

Continuing talks of constitutional reform led to the role of the monarchy in Canada coming under scrutiny in the lead up to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982. However, proposals for change were thwarted by the provinces, including Quebec.

The notion of a republic was raised publicly in the early 1990s, when Peter C. Newman wrote in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; that the monarchy should be abolished in favour of a head of state &quot;who would reflect our own, instead of imported, values.&quot; Then, in 1997, Deputy Prime Minister John Manley echoed Newman when he expressed at the end of a television interview his opinion that Canada should abolish its monarchy, citing Australia&#x27;s contemporary discussions around the Australian Crown. Then, in December of the following year, the Prime Minister&#x27;s press secretary, Peter Donolo, who also complained that the monarch made Canada appear as a &quot;colonial outpost&quot;, unaccountably announced through a media story that the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office was considering the abolition of the monarchy as a millennium project, though no definitive plans had been made. Donolo later supported Manley when, on Victoria Day 2001, Manley said on CBC Radio that he believed that hereditary succession was outdated, and that the country&#x27;s head of state should be elected. Then, just prior to the Queen&#x27;s pan-country tour to celebrate her Golden Jubilee the following year, Manley (at that point the designated minister in attendance for the sovereign&#x27;s arrival in Ottawa) again stated his preference for a &quot;wholly Canadian&quot; institution to replace the present monarchy after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II; he was rebuked by other Cabinet members, a former prime minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, as well as a number of prominent journalists.

In 2002, the group Citizens for a Canadian Republic was established to promote the abolition of the Canadian monarchy in favour of a republic, at approximately the same time &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper began a campaign against the monarchy, with three republican journalists on staffMargaret Wente, Jeffrey Simpson, and Lawrence Martinthough the editorial board argued Canada could dispose of its monarchy without becoming a republic. Tom Freda, chairman and co-founder of Citizens for a Canadian Republic, called for simply replacing the monarchy with the governor general, saying that he&#x27;s not in favour of destroying Canada&#x27;s identity or cultural institutions: &quot;All we&#x27;re advocating is that the link to the monarchy, in our Constitution, be severed. Our governor general for the past 60 years has performed all the duties of a head of state, and there&#x27;s no reason we shouldn&#x27;t make our governor general our official head of state.&quot; Freda also, however, called the governor general and lieutenant governors &quot;redundant&quot;.

At approximately the same time, the editors of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; began calling for the governor general to be made head of state under the guise of &quot;patriating the monarchy&quot;, and arguing that Canada could rid itself of its Crown without becoming a republic, and backing their journalist Jeffrey Simpson&#x27;s preference for the Companions of the Order of Canada to choose the head of state in a Canadian republic.

Lawrence Martin called for Canada to become a republic in order to re-brand the nation and better its standings in the international market, he cited Sweden – a constitutional monarchy – as an example to be followed.

In 2007, Quebec sovereignty again collided with the monarchy, when Quebec separatists threatened to mount demonstrations should the Queen be in attendance at the ceremonies for the 400th anniversary of Quebec City; Mario Beaulieu, then Vice-President of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society announced that the Queen&#x27;s presence would be a catalyst for action, saying: &quot;You can be sure that people will demonstrate in protest... We are celebrating the foundation of New France, not its conquest. The monarchy remains a symbol of imperialism and colonialism. Her presence will not be welcomed&quot;, and Gérald Larose, president of the Quebec Sovereignty Council, stated that the monarchy was &quot;the most despicable, appalling, anti-democratic, imperial, colonial symbol against which all social and individuals rights were obtained through the course of history.&quot;

At the Liberal Party of Canada convention in January 2012, its members debated on a motion to include severing ties with the monarchy as a party platform. The proposed motion was rejected by 67 per cent.

On October 26, 2022, Bloc Québécois (BQ) Leader Yves-François Blanchet moved a motion calling for the severing of &quot;ties between the Canadian State and the British monarchy&quot; in the Federal House of Commons, It was rejected 44 to 266.

==Activities==
As abolition of the monarchy would require a constitutional amendment made only after the achievement of unanimous consent amongst the federal parliament and all ten provincial legislatures, republicans face difficulty in achieving their goal. Further, though republicans have pointed to Ireland and India as models that could be adapted to Canada, no specific form of republic or selection method for a president has been decided on, and the Canadian populace remains largely indifferent to the issue.

Up until 2010, most republican action had taken the form of protests on Victoria Daythe Canadian sovereign&#x27;s official birthdayin Toronto, lobbying of the federal and provincial governments to eliminate Canadian royal symbols, and legal action against the Crown, specifically in relation to the Oath of Citizenship and the Act of Settlement 1701.

Today, most of Citizens for a Canadian Republic&#x27;s activities are educational, providing commentators to the media and networking with supporters in all political parties.

In 2013, several former members of Citizens for a Canadian Republic formed Republic Now, led by Ashok Charles, which has a more activist approach in advocating for a republic.

Ted McWhinney has argued that Canada can become a republic upon the demise of the current monarch by not proclaiming a successor; according to McWhinney, this would be a way for the constitution to evolve &quot;more subtly and by indirection, through creating new glosses on the Law of the Constitution as written, without formally amending it.&quot; However, Ian Holloway, Dean of Law at the University of Western Ontario, criticized this proposal for its ignorance of provincial input, and opined that its implementation &quot;would be contrary to the plain purpose of those who framed our system of government.&quot;

== Opinion polling ==
Polls conducted on the subject of abolition of the Canadian Crown in 2022 and 2023, following the accession of Charles III, stated that 58% of Canadians think there should be a referendum on the future of the monarchy and between 40% and 54% of Canadians favour becoming a republic. However, pollster Michael Ashcroft cautioned that &quot;for change to happen in Canada, the issue would have to find its way to the top of the political agenda. It’s hard to see what could be the catalyst for that to happen.”

<doc id="1283488" wikidata="Q5427464" url="?curid=1283488" title="F (programming language)">
<text>F is a modular, compiled, numeric programming language, designed for scientific programming and scientific computation. F was developed as a modern Fortran, thus making it a subset of Fortran 95. It combines both numerical and data abstraction features from these languages. F is also backwards compatible with Fortran 77, allowing calls to Fortran 77 programs. F was implemented on top of compilers from NAG, Fujitsu, Salford Software and Absoft. It was later included in the g95 compiler.

== Overview ==
F is designed to be a minimal subset of Fortran, with only about one hundred intrinsic procedures. Language keywords and intrinsic function names are reserved keywords in F and no other names may take this exact form. F contains the same character set used in Fortran 90/95 with a limit of 132 characters. Reserved words are always written in lowercase. Any uppercase letter may appear in a character constant. Variable names do not have restriction and can include upper and lowercase characters.

===Operators===
F supports many of the standard operators used in Fortran. The operators supported by F are: 
* Arithmetic operators: codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5
* Relational operators: codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11 
* Logical operators: codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16 
* character concatenation: codice_17

The assignment operator is denoted by the equal sign codice_18. In addition, pointer assignment is denoted by codice_19. Comments are denoted by the codice_20 symbol:

variable = expression ! assignment 
pointer =&gt; target ! pointer assignment
===Data types===
Similar to Fortran, the type specification is made up of a type, a list of attributes for the declared variables, and the variable list. F provides the same types as Fortran, except that double precision floating point variables must be declared as real with a kind with a kind parameter:
! type [,attribute list] :: entity declaration list
real :: x, y ! declaring variables of type real x,y without an attribute list
integer (kind = long), dimension (100) :: x ! declaring variable of type big integer array with the identifier x
character (len = 100) :: student_name ! declaring a character type variable with len 100
F does not have intrinsic support for object-oriented programming, but it does allow for records:
type, public :: City
 character (len = 100) :: name
 character (len = 50) :: state
end type City
Variable declarations are followed by an attribute list. The attributes allowed are codice_21, codice_22, codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_26, codice_27, codice_28, codice_29 and codice_30. The attribute list is followed by codice_31, which is part of the syntax. F also allows for optional initialization in the list of objects. All items in a list will have the same attributes in a given type declaration statement. In addition, declarations are attribute oriented instead of entity oriented.

===Statement and control flow===
F supports 3 statements for control flow: codice_32, a basic conditional, codice_33, a switch statement, and codice_34, a conditional while loop. The codice_35, codice_36, codice_37, and codice_38 statements from Fortran may be used to break control flow.
real :: x

do i = 100
 x = x+i
 print*,i
 cycle
end do

max : do
 if (x &gt; y) then
 exit max
 end if
 x = y
end do max
stop

if (x &lt; y) then
 x = x + y
else if ( x &gt; y) then
 x = y - x
end if

select case (maximum):
 case (0)
 x = 0
 case (1)
 x = 1
 case (5)
 x = 5
 case default 
 x = 10
end select
F places a heavy emphasis on modular programming.
program main
 ! Insert code here
end program main
Placing procedures outside of a module is prohibited. F supports most of the functions and subroutines found in the Fortran 95 standard library. All functions in F are external by default and require a result clause that returns the value of a function. F supports recursion.

All of the intrinsic procedures found in Fortran 95 may be used in F, with the exceptions of codice_39, codice_40, codice_41, codice_42, codice_43, codice_44, codice_45, codice_46, codice_47, codice_48, and codice_49.

<text>Caridina multidentata is a species of shrimp in the family Atyidae. It is native to Japan and Taiwan. Its common names include Yamato shrimp, Japanese shrimp, Amano shrimp, and algae shrimp.

==Description==
&quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; are freshwater shrimp in the Atyidae family and are commonly found in southwestern Japan. They typically grow to 25-35 millimetres. This species of shrimp is amphidromous. Oviposition and hatching occurs in freshwater, and newly hatched larvae drift to saltwater and develop as juveniles, returning to freshwater in their adult forms. The eggs of &quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; are rich in yolk and are oval-shaped.

The species has adapted to live in fast-flowing water, having a wide and short rostrum. &quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; begin to take in food in the third zoeal stage, relying on internal nutrition longer than distant relatives such as the &quot;Caridina leucosticta&quot; and &quot;Caridina typus&quot;. They have a large geographic distribution, suggesting high levels of larval dispertion.
This species has a translucent body covered with a broken line of reddish brown points on its sides. The dorsal surface has a white stripe that runs from the head to the tail and the eyes are black. Females are easily distinguished from males by their more elongated lower row of dots.

&quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; fare best in temperatures of 18 °C to 28 °C (approximately 64 °F to 82 °F). They are more active at higher temperatures, but may also have a shorter lifespan. They prefer a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. As with all crustaceans, they are extremely averse to copper due to their haemocyanin blood.

==In Captivity==

&quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; was introduced into the world of aquaria by Takashi Amano in the early 1980s. They are usually used in an aquarium because they feed primarily on algae, thus cleaning the aquarium of it when present in sufficient numbers. &quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; was previously known to aquarists as &quot;Caridina japonica&quot; but was renamed &quot;Caridina multidentata&quot; following a study in 2006. 

Many aquarists believe that Amano shrimp can sustain themselves on algae in the aquarium alone, however, this is not the case. Amano shrimp thrive best on a diet of aquarium algae supplemented by algae wafers or spirulina flakes and occasional animal-based protein in the form of pellets, flakes, or frozen or live daphnia, mysis, and more. It is also necessary to ensure there is calcium present in the water, as calcium is vital to crustaceans in order for them to maintain their exoskeleton.

Amano shrimp are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity, as their young require a higher water salinity than the adults to survive. This means that virtually all amano shrimp in the pet trade are wild caught, since captive breeding is not considered economical.

<text>Anthony Walter Patrick Hamilton (17 March 1904 – 23 September 1962) was an English playwright and novelist. 
He was well regarded by Graham Greene and J. B. Priestley, and study of his novels has been revived because of their distinctive style, deploying a Dickensian narrative voice to convey aspects of inter-war London street culture. They display a strong sympathy for the poor, as well as an acerbic black humour. Doris Lessing wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1968: &quot;Hamilton was a marvellous novelist who&#x27;s grossly neglected&quot;.

His two most successful plays, &quot;Rope&quot; (1929) and &quot;Gas Light&quot; (1938), were made into famous films: Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot; (1948); the UK-made &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1940), followed by the 1944 American version.

== Life and works ==
Hamilton was born on 17 March 1904, at Dale House, in the Sussex village of Hassocks, near Brighton, to (Walter) Bernard Hamilton (1863-1930), a writer and non-practising barrister, and his second wife, Ellen Adèle (née Hockley; 1861-1934), who wrote as &quot;Olivia Roy&quot;. His parents were pretentious and snobbish; Bernard Hamilton thought himself to be &quot;a great writer although the few books he penned — soppy romances and some hotchpotch of religion and spirituality — were mediocre at best&quot;, &quot;frequently boasted about his genealogical table&quot;, and &quot;pretended to be the rightful heir to the throne of Scotland&quot;, and Ellen &quot;treated her domestics with haughtiness&quot; and &quot;attempted to breed her children as members of the high society&quot;. Due to his father&#x27;s alcoholism and financial ineptitude, the family spent much of Hamilton&#x27;s childhood living in boarding houses in Chiswick and Hove. His education was patchy, and ended just after his fifteenth birthday when his mother withdrew him from Westminster School. His first published work was a poem, &quot;Heaven&quot;, in the &quot;Poetry Review&quot; in 1919. His sister Lalla, acted under the name of Diana Hamilton and starred in Sutton Vane&#x27;s &quot;Outward Bound&quot;.

After a brief career as an actor, he became a novelist in his early twenties with the publication of &quot;Monday Morning&quot; (1925), written when he was nineteen. &quot;Craven House&quot; (1926) and &quot;Twopence Coloured&quot; (1928) followed, but his first real success was the play &quot;Rope&quot; (1929, known as &quot;Rope&#x27;s End&quot; in America).

&quot;The Midnight Bell&quot; (1929) is based upon Hamilton&#x27;s falling in love with a prostitute and was later published along with &quot;The Siege of Pleasure&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Plains of Cement&quot; (1934) as the semi-autobiographical trilogy &quot;Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky&quot; (1935).
Hamilton disliked many aspects of modern life. He was disfigured badly when he was run over by a car in the late 1920s: the end of his novel &quot;Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse&quot; (1953), with its vision of England smothered in metal beetles, reflects his loathing of the motor car. Despite some distaste for the culture in which he operated, however, he was a popular contributor to it. His two most successful plays, &quot;Rope&quot; and &quot;Gas Light&quot; (1938, known as &quot;Angel Street&quot; in the US), made Hamilton wealthy and were also successful as films: the British-made &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1940), the 1944 American adaptation of &quot;Gaslight&quot;, and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot; (1948).

&quot;Hangover Square&quot; (1941) is often judged his most accomplished work and still sells well in paperback, and is regarded by contemporary authors such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd as an important part of the tradition of London novels. Set in Earls Court where Hamilton himself lived, it deals with both alcohol-drinking practices of the time and the underlying political context, such as the rise of fascism and responses to it. Hamilton became an avowed Marxist, though not a publicly declared member of the Communist Party. During the 1930s, like many other authors, Hamilton grew increasingly angry with capitalism and believed that the violence and fascism of Europe during the period indicated that capitalism was reaching its end. This encouraged his Marxism and his novel &quot;Impromptu in Moribundia&quot; (1939) was a satirical attack on capitalist culture.

During his later life, Hamilton developed in his writing a misanthropic authorial voice which became more disillusioned, cynical and bleak as time passed. &quot;The Slaves of Solitude&quot; (1947) was his only work to deal directly with the Second World War and he preferred to look back to the pre-war years. His &quot;Gorse Trilogy&quot; – three novels about a devious sexual predator and conman – are not generally well thought of critically, although Graham Greene said that the first was &#x27;the best book written about Brighton&#x27; and the second (&quot;Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse&quot;) is regarded increasingly as a comic masterpiece. The hostile and negative tone of the novels is also attributed to Hamilton&#x27;s depression and disenchantment with the utopianism of Marxism. The trilogy comprises: &quot;The West Pier&quot; (1952); &quot;Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse&quot; (1953), dramatized as &quot;The Charmer&quot; in 1987; and in 1955 Hamilton&#x27;s last published work, &quot;Unknown Assailant&quot;, a short novel much of which was dictated while Hamilton was drunk. &quot;The Gorse Trilogy&quot; was first published in a single volume in 1992.

Hamilton had begun to consume alcohol excessively while still a relatively young man. After a declining career and melancholia, he died in 1962 of cirrhosis of the liver and kidney failure, in Sheringham, Norfolk. He was married twice, firstly to Lois Marie Martin in 1930, and a year after divorcing Lois, to Lady Ursula Chetwynd-Talbot (a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym Laura Talbot) in 1954.

A collection of Hamilton&#x27;s manuscripts and correspondence can be found at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

== Recent revival ==
Hamilton was the subject of a special season of films in March 2005 at the National Film Theatre in London, and continuing the strong revival of interest in his work the British TV channel BBC Two screened an adaptation of &quot;20,000 Streets Under the Sky&quot; in September 2005, reshown on BBC Four in January 2006, alongside a documentary account of his life. The adaptation was released on DVD in 2007. A one-man show about Hamilton&#x27;s life appeared in the Edinburgh Festival in 2014 and the Brighton Fringe Festival in 2015 and in London, written and performed by Mark Farrelly and called &quot;The Silence of Snow: the Life of Patrick Hamilton&quot;.

<doc id="1283539" wikidata="Q1750952" url="?curid=1283539" title="Basket Case (song)">
<text>&quot;Basket Case&quot; is a song by rock band Green Day, released on August 1, 1994 by Reprise Records as the second single from the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994). The song spent five weeks at the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart and garnered a Grammy Award nomination in the category for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. Its music video was directed by Mark Kohr and filmed in an abandoned mental institution in California. In 2001, the song appeared on their greatest hits album &quot;International Superhits!&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Basket Case&quot; was ranked number 150 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s updated list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Origin and recording==
Green Day vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong said &quot;Basket Case&quot; is about his struggle with anxiety; before he was diagnosed with a panic disorder years afterward, he thought he was going crazy. Armstrong commented that at the time, &quot;The only way I could know what the hell was going on was to write a song about it.&quot;

&quot;Basket Case&quot; was one of the songs producer Rob Cavallo heard when he received Green Day&#x27;s demo tape. Originally, the song was written as a love ballad, but he scrapped the original lyrics in favor of the new lyrics that we know of today. He ended up signing the band to Reprise Records in mid-1993. Green Day and Cavallo recorded the version of &quot;Basket Case&quot; released on the trio&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Dookie&quot; between September and October 1993 at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California.

In April 2021, Armstrong revealed in his book &quot;Welcome to My Panic&quot; that he wrote the song whilst on speed and that it was written in Glasgow, Scotland.

==Composition==

&quot;Basket Case&quot; is a punk rock and pop-punk song, performed in the key of E-flat major. The introductory verse features only Armstrong and his guitar. Towards the end of the first chorus, the rest of the band joins in, with Tré Cool adding fast tom fills and explosive transitions and Mike Dirnt adding a bass line that is reminiscent of the vocal melody. In the second verse, &quot;Basket Case&quot; references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that &quot;I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It&#x27;s also looking at the world and saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s not as black and white as you think. This isn&#x27;t your grandfather&#x27;s prostitute – or maybe it was.&#x27;&quot; The song&#x27;s chord progression closely mirrors that of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Basket Case&quot; was the second single released from &quot;Dookie&quot;, following &quot;Longview&quot;. It peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, a position it maintained for five weeks. In 1995, the song garnered a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group category.

In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton wrote, &quot;Something of an instant classic [...] it is certainly one of the most alternative Top 10 smash since Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Creep&quot;. As to where it goes next it is hard to tell but it could potentially open the door for a flood of the post-Nirvana young American rock bands who are currently making waves on the other side of the Atlantic.&quot; Andrew Mueller from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; commented, &quot;Green Day themselves are an enthusiastically rockin&#x27; kind of act who&#x27;ve learnt a neat trick or two from The Buzzcocks and The Ramones and are the sort of band I&#x27;m regrettably likely to think are the future of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll if I&#x27;ve drunk enough to stun an ox.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; gave the song three out of five, describing it as &quot;the Generation X-flag-wavers&#x27; splenetic slice of Bay Area punk&quot;. John Mulvey from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;Long-time heroes of the US skatepunk scene. Green Day are These Animal Men without the crap Brit-mod trappings and with slightly better songs. Bouncy, a bit fraggly and a bit annoying, but there are worse things in the world. Like &#x27;Speed King&#x27;, for starters.&quot; 

Upon the re-release, another &quot;NME&quot; editor, Andy Richardson, praised it as &quot;an irresistible punk snort, a ripping three-minute blast or the ultimate good mood record to play before you go out, depending which way you look at it.&quot; Paul Evans from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared it as a &quot;rave-up&quot;, noting that Green Day&#x27;s lyrics &quot;score graffiti hits&quot;. Mark Sutherland from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it a top score of five out of five and named it Best New Single. He wrote, &quot;Their last single &#x27;Welcome to Paradise&#x27; grazed the top 20 here but this is the one to make your mum hammer on your bedroom door &#x27;cos it sounds like you&#x27;re smashing up your wardrobe. And the funny thing is — you will be &#x27;cos it&#x27;s quite the most fantastic bedroom-trashing anthem in too long a while.&quot; Charles Aaron from &quot;Spin&quot; ranked &quot;Basket Case&quot; number 19 in his list of the &quot;Top 20 Singles of the Year&quot; in December 1994. Troy J. Augusto from &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;psycho-rave&quot;.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;Basket Case&quot; was directed by Mark Kohr. It was filmed in an actual mental institution called Agnews Developmental Center in Santa Clara County, California, at the request of the band members. The mental institution had been abandoned, but most of the structure remained in a broken-down state. The band members found old patient files, deep scratches in the walls and dental molds scattered around. The video frequently references the films &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Brazil&quot;. The video was originally filmed in monochrome with the colors painstakingly added in later, hence the over-saturated, surreal look. 

The video was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1995: Video of the Year, Best Group Video, Best Metal/Hard Rock Video, Best Alternative Video, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, and Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award. The video did not win in any of the categories it was nominated for.

The video for &quot;Basket Case&quot; was later published on Green Day&#x27;s official YouTube channel in October 2009. It has amassed more than 339 million views as of January 2024. In February 2024, the video was remastered in 4K.

==Impact and legacy==
In 2006, on Mike Davies and Zane Lowe&#x27;s Lock Up Special on BBC Radio 1, the listeners voted &quot;Basket Case&quot; the Greatest Punk Song of All Time. In 2009, it was named the 33rd best hard rock song of all time by VH1. In 2021, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number three on their list of the 20 greatest Green Day songs, while it was ranked number 150 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; that same year. In 2022, &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked &quot;Basket Case&quot; number two on their list of the 10 greatest Green Day songs.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic featured &quot;Basket Case&quot; in his 1996 polka medley &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot; from &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;.

In August 2017, the English band Bastille released a version of the song for the Peter Serafinowicz series &quot;The Tick&quot;, but the song was never used in the show.

The song has also been covered and released as a promotional single by Avril Lavigne, who performed the song during her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour and included on her live album &quot;Avril Lavigne: My World&quot;.

In 2024, it was added to &quot;Fortnite&quot; in &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; as a jam track alongside &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; and &quot;When I Come Around&quot;.

The song was featured in the video game &quot;BMX XXX&quot;. It is also featured in the dance rhythm game &quot;Just Dance 2025 Edition&quot;.

<text>The original name of Mueang district, Uttaradit, was Bang Pho. This district was under the control of Phi Chai District. Later, it was established as Uttaradit Province and Bang Pho District became the capital district. It was changed to Mueang Uttaradit District recently.

* East – Tha Pla and Thong Saen Khan Districts.
* South – Thong Saen Khan and Tron Districts.
* West – Laplae District.

==History==
In the past, Mueang District was called &quot;Bang Pho Tah It&quot;. It grew rapidly due to its harbor. King Rama V ordered the capital moved from Phi Chai District to Muang District. Next, in the reign of King Rama VI, the king ordered the incorporation of Mueang District into Uttaradit Province.

==Climate==

Uttaradit has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with an average daily maximum of . The monsoon season runs from May through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

<doc id="1283562" wikidata="Q3239116" url="?curid=1283562" title="Line I (Buenos Aires Underground)">
<text>Line I is a planned addition to the Buenos Aires Underground.

Line I will run from Parque Chacabuco (&quot;Directorio&quot;) to Ciudad Universitaria with 18 new stations. The route length would be 12.6 km. The future of this line (which had the lowest priority in the expansion plans) is currently uncertain since it has been proposed that a Metrobus line be built instead, which would follow the same route as the proposed metro rail line.

The first phase would have a route that went from Parque Chacabuco to Plaza Italia (&quot;Serrano&quot;), a length of 6.6 km, and the line would have 10 stations.

==Phase 1==
 Serrano - Directorio line is planned as follows:

* Serrano 
* Costa Rica
* Córdoba
* Corrientes 
* Warnes
* Díaz Vélez
* Aranguen
* Rivadavia 
* Pedro Goyena
* Directorio 

==Phase 2==
* Palermo (interchange to Line D)
* Chenaut
* Jorge Newbery
* Teodoro García
* Virrey del Pino
* Barrancas de Belgrano

<text>Arturo Pérez-Reverte Gutiérrez (born 25 November 1951) is a Spanish novelist and journalist. He worked as a war correspondent for RTVE for 21 years (1973–1994). His first novel, &quot;El húsar&quot;, set in the Napoleonic Wars, was published in 1986.

He is well known outside Spain for his Captain Alatriste series of adventure novels, which have been translated into multiple languages. Since 2003 he has been a member of the Royal Spanish Academy.

==Writing==
Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s novels are usually centered on one strongly defined character, and his plots move along swiftly, often featuring a narrator who is part of the story but apart from it. Most of his novels take place in Spain or around the Mediterranean. They often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea. The novels frequently deal with some of the major issues of modern Spain, such as drug trafficking or the relationship of religion and politics.

Often, Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s novels have two plots running in parallel with little connection between them except for shared characters. For example, in &quot;The Club Dumas&quot;, the protagonist is searching the world for a lost book and keeps meeting people who parallel figures from Dumas&#x27;s novels; in &quot;The Flanders Panel&quot;, a contemporary serial killer is juxtaposed with the mystery of a 500-year-old assassination.

In his often polemical newspaper columns and the main characters of his novels, Pérez-Reverte frequently expresses pessimism about human behaviour, shaped by his wartime experiences in such places as El Salvador, Croatia or Bosnia. His views have also been shaped by his research for crime shows.

Throughout his career, and especially in its latter half, he has been noted for cultivating his trademark maverick, non-partisan and at times abrasive persona. This has occasionally been a source of conflict with other journalists and writers. He originally refused to have his novels translated from the original Spanish to any language other than French. However, English translations were eventually published for some of his works, and most of his work is also available in Portuguese and Polish.

Pérez-Reverte was elected to seat &quot;T&quot; of the Real Academia Española on 23 January 2003; he took up his seat on 12 June the same year.

Themes such as the hero&#x27;s tiredness, adventure, friendship, the journey as danger, death as the last journey, and culture and memory as the only salvation that allows understanding reality, enduring pain and knowing the identity of the person and the world are frequent in his novels. The writer&#x27;s view of existence in general is bleak. He hates Christian humanism and believes that pagan philosophy has a more accurate view of the world. Typical Revertian characters are the weary hero in hostile territory with a dark past and the femme fatal. Among the traits of the characters, the moral ambiguity stands out.

In the articles he publishes every Sunday in XLSemanal magazine, he harshly criticizes postmodernity, political correctness, gender ideology, neoliberalism, neoconservatism, the critical pedagogy, the European Union, the inclusive language and the woke thought. These articles were published in the following books: &quot;Patente de corso&quot; (1993-1998), &quot;Con ánimo de ofender&quot; (1998-2001), &quot;No me cogeréis vivo&quot; (2001-2005) and &quot;Cuando éramos honrados mercenarios&quot; (2005-2009).
He regrets that society is conditioned by the &quot;whim of minorities&quot; and that Europe, &quot;the moral reference of the West&quot;, copies the values of society in the United States, considered by him as &quot;sick and hypocritical&quot; . He affirms that political correctness has its origins in Anglo-Saxon puritanism.

An active user on Twitter, he has already created numerous controversies. In a controversial article he compared the European refugee crisis with the barbarian invasions that led to the fall of the Roman Empire. However, he was awarded the &quot;Premio Don Quijote&quot; of journalism.

In 1998 he published a very harsh article against global capitalism that prophesied the world 2007–2008 financial crisis. This article was very successful on the internet when the crisis happened in Spain.

=== Awards and recognition ===
*&quot;The Painter of Battles&quot; was the winner of the 2008 Premio Gregor von Rezzori award for foreign fiction translated into Italian.
*In 2016 Pérez-Reverte was named as one of the 10 most important writers of the year by the Spanish national newspaper &quot;ABC&quot;.

==Personal life==

Pérez-Reverte started his journalistic career writing for the now-defunct newspaper &quot;Pueblo&quot; and then for Televisión Española (the Spanish state-owned television broadcaster), often as a war correspondent. Becoming weary of the internal affairs at TVE, he resigned as a journalist and decided to work full-time as a writer.

His teenage daughter Carlota was billed as a co-author of his first Alatriste novel. He lives between La Navata (near Madrid) and his native Cartagena, from where he enjoys sailing solo in the Mediterranean. He was a friend of Javier Marías, who presented Pérez-Reverte with the title of Duke of Corso of the Kingdom of Redonda micro nation.

His nephew Arturo Juan Pérez-Reverte is a professional footballer playing for FC Cartagena.

Perez-Reverte owns a library which has an estimated 32,000 books.

==Controversies==

Mexican novelist Verónica Murguía accused Arturo Pérez-Reverte of plagiarizing her work. On 10 November 1997 Murguía published a short story, titled &quot;Historia de Sami&quot;, in the magazine &quot;El laberinto urbano&quot;. Months later, in March 1998, Pérez-Reverte published a story in &quot;El Semanal&quot;, with the title &quot;Un chucho mejicano&quot;, bearing close similarities in narration, chronology, phrases, and in the anecdote. Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s story was recently republished in a re-compilation for the text &quot;Perros e hijos de perra&quot; (Alfaguara), and Murguía noticed the plagiarism at that time. Murguía would not proceed with a legal case but asked for an apology and the removal of the story from his text. Meanwhile, Pérez-Reverte apologized and noted that the story he published he wrote exactly as it was told to him by writer Sealtiel Alatriste.

Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s script for the film &quot;Gitano&quot; in the late 1990s also brought another charge of plagiarism against him. In May 2011 the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid ordered Pérez-Reverte and Manuel Palacios, director and co-writer of &quot;Gitano&quot;, to pay 80,000 euros to filmmaker Antonio González-Vigil, who had sued them for alleged plagiarism of the film&#x27;s script. Pérez-Reverte described this decision as &quot;a clear ambush&quot; and a &quot;clear manoeuvre to extort money.&quot; The ruling contradicted two previous criminal rulings, and one from a merchant judiciary which had all decided in favor of Pérez-Reverte and Palacios. In July 2013 the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid ordered Pérez-Reverte to pay 200,000 euros to González-Vigil for plagiarism.

<text>Deep Springs Valley is a high desert valley in the Inyo-White Mountains of Inyo County, California. It is east of the Owens Valley and the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and south of Fish Lake Valley, Nevada, near the California-Nevada state border.

California State Route 168 connects it to the Owens and Fish Lake valleys, crossing Westgard Pass to the west and Gilbert Pass to the north. To the northwest lies White Mountain Peak. To the east lies Eureka Valley, connected via Soldier Pass in the Piper Mountain Wilderness, which can be traversed on horseback but not by automobile.

==Geography==
Deep Springs Lake is a playa, a seasonal salt lake, generally drying in the summer to produce a salt pan, with surface water replenished in late spring with flows from nearby springs and snowmelt that travels the length of the valley from Wyman and Crooked creeks, which enter from the north. Birds, and birdwatchers, flock to the Lake during the spring and fall migrations. Surrounding the lake are numerous springs, some artesian, which gave the valley its name.

The springs are home to the Deep Springs black toad (&quot;Bufo exsul&quot;, or &quot;exile toad&quot;), an endemic species that occurs only in Deep Springs Valley. Although the population in Antelope Springs was once thought to be introduced, a genetics study published in 2009 found that there was not strong similarity to the perceived source population and this population likely occurs naturally. The population of toads, however, appears to be stable, despite the presence of cattle that graze around the lake during the winter and spring.

==Geology==
On the hillsides of the southwestern end of the valley, lie the Poleta Folds, a distinctly visible example of crustal folding frequently studied by geology students from the University of California and California State University educational systems. The intensely folded and clearly visible layers comprise the Cambrian-aged Poleta formation. Several complex fault systems add to the challenge for geology students to unravel the area&#x27;s history. The Poleta Folds field area is revered as one of the most complexly folded and faulted in California, and has been used by generations of undergraduate-level geology students around the United States and Canada. During a typical summer one can often find near-established trails leading to the best outcrops.

Also easily visible at the base of the Inyo Mountains, in the southwestern end of the valley behind Deep Springs Lake, is a sizable dip-slip fault. Researchers showed that the most recent fault scarp had an average displacement of along a section of the fault. With an estimated rupture area of , the event was calculated to have a moment magnitude of 7.0 and was estimated to have occurred about 1,800 years ago. The fault is still active, but studies suggest that it slips about every 4000 years. Deep Springs Lake is at . At in elevation, the lake is intermittently filled and actively precipitating dolomite, understood to rarely occur in such conditions.

==Population==
It is the home of Deep Springs College, a nontraditional two-year liberal arts institution with about 26 students. There are also ruins of an early small mining establishment, White Mountain City, in the northwest corner of the valley.

<doc id="1283596" wikidata="Q5379320" url="?curid=1283596" title="Enoch Pratt">
<text>Enoch Pratt (September 10, 1808 – September 17, 1896) was an American businessman in Baltimore, Maryland. Pratt was also a committed active Unitarian, and a philanthropist. He is best known for his donations to establish the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and expanding the former Sheppard Asylum to become The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, (now known as the Sheppard-Pratt Hospital for mental health and psychiatric research), located north of the city in western Towson, county seat of Baltimore County. Born and raised in Massachusetts, he moved south to the Chesapeake Bay area and became devoted to the civic interests of the city of Baltimore. He earned his fortune as an owner of business interests beginning in the 1830s originally as a hardware wholesaler, and later expanding into railroads, banking and finance, iron works, and steamship lines and other transportation companies.

==Early life==
Born in Middleborough, Massachusetts, Enoch Pratt was the second of eight children born to Isaac and Naomi (née Keith) Pratt. A successful businessman, Isaac Pratt managed several businesses, including a sawmill, general store, wholesale hardware. The young Enoch was educated at the former Bridgewater Academy in the neighboring town of Bridgewater, Massachusetts&#x27;s Town Common. After graduating, at the age of 15, Enoch Pratt began his first job in business as a clerk in a Boston hardware establishment.

In 1831, Pratt moved to Baltimore with $150 to launch his own wholesale iron hardware business, Enoch Pratt &amp; Brothers at 23-25 South Charles Street, between East Baltimore and German (now Redwood) Streets. The business proved successful, and six years later, Pratt married Maria Louisa Hyde (1818–1913), the daughter of Samuel G. and Catherine Hyde, whom he met at his church on August 1, 1837. Their marriage was happy, but they were unable to have children.

==Business career==
With his successful hardware business, Pratt became involved in other businesses as vice president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, who built their southern terminal in 1849-1850 at the President Street Station, at President and Fleet Streets, east of the harbor &quot;basin&quot; (today&#x27;s Inner Harbor). He also served as president of the National Farmers&#x27; and Planters&#x27; Bank of Baltimore, and was the controlling stockholder in the Maryland Steamboat Company. In 1851, Pratt and his partner invested in western Maryland coal mines and iron yards in the expanding and developing industrial and commercial Baltimore neighborhood of Canton. They made their own merchandise, thereby ending their dependence on northern manufacturers. From 1860 until his death in 1896, he was the president of the National Farmers&#x27; and Planters&#x27; Bank of Baltimore. Pratt also became president of the Baltimore Clearing House and the Maryland Bankers&#x27; Association, in addition to establishing a role in several transportation companies. He was also a director for three other railroads, including the famous Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He was a contemporary and associate of philanthropist Thomas Kelso (1784-1878). They served together on the board of the P.W. &amp; B. Railroad Company.

==Philanthropy==
During his early years as a businessman, Pratt&#x27;s philanthropy started with donations to his church, the First Independent Church of Baltimore (later the First Unitarian Church (Unitarian and Universalist), at North Charles and West Franklin Streets, where he served as a trustee for over 40 years. He paid off several of the congregation&#x27;s large debts, bought a new organ, and financed significant remodeling of the church in the 1890s. Other early philanthropy included his patronage of the artist Edward Sheffield Bartholomew, Pratt commissioned many public sculptures and memorials throughout Baltimore, including the statue of George Washington erected in Druid Hill Park.

Pratt gave much of his time and wealth to Baltimore&#x27;s cultural and charitable institutions. He served as a trustee of the Peabody Institute. He founded the &quot;House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children&quot; which he offered on his former farm property at Cheltenham (in Prince George&#x27;s County), and the Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb located at Frederick on South Market Street. In 1865, he donated a free school and public library (The Pratt Free School in 1856, and further endowed upon its 1865 incorporation - which later became a public grammar school preparing students for advancement to the local Middleborough High School, founded 1873), to his hometown of Middleborough in Massachusetts.

He died on September 17, 1896, at his summer residence &quot;Tivoli&quot;, a mansion of Italianate style which he bought in 1870, off Woodbourne Avenue in northeast Baltimore.
===Enoch Pratt Free Library===
Pratt is best known for his establishment of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. Many residents of the city in late 1881 speculated what was being planned for the excavations going on in the north side of West Mulberry Street, by Cathedral Street, near the old Baltimore Cathedral in the tony Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal neighborhood, north of the business district on Cathedral Hill. The mystery was explained when on January 21, 1882, in a letter addressed to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Pratt offered a gift of a central library, four branch libraries (with two additional ones to be constructed shortly thereafter), and a financial endowment of (U.S.) $1,058,333. Further, he requested that to Mayor William Pinkney Whyte and the Council continue an annual appropriation to the new library system and support it in the years to come to supplement the interest and benefits accumulating from the principal of his bequest. His intention was to establish a library that &quot;shall be for all, rich and poor without distinction of race or color, who, when properly accredited, can take out the books if they will handle them carefully and return them.&quot; The grant was accepted by the municipal government, approved by the General Assembly of Maryland with some enabling legislation, and approved by the city voters later that year in an election/referendum on October 25, 1882. After four years of plans, construction and the hiring of staff with the purchasing of many books, the new library was ready to be opened in January 1886 with some appropriate addresses at ceremonies at the nearby luxurious auditorium of the Academy of Music on North Howard Street (between West Centre and West Franklin Streets), and opened to new patrons and business at the beginning of February 1886.

===Sheppard Asylum===
Pratt left the vast majority of his wealth ($2 million of his $2.5 million) to supplement the earlier endowment of The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, (as it was later renamed, today it is titled &quot;Sheppard Pratt Health System,&quot; giving equal weight to both generous co-founders). Pratt was impressed by the trustees&#x27; frugal handling of the original founder&#x27;s - Moses Sheppard, (1771/1773?-1857), endowment from 1857. &quot;They are the only Board of Trustees in Baltimore,&quot; said Pratt, &quot;who have carried out exactly the directions of the founder.&quot; Pratt&#x27;s bequest was used to complete construction of the old Moses Sheppard Asylum, enlarge the facility to house 200 additional patients at its country campus in western Towson, further north of the city off (North) Charles Street Avenue in suburban Baltimore County, at the old &quot;Mount Airy Farm&quot; of Baltimore merchant Thomas Poultney, which they purchased in 1858 and began construction two years later, however not opening until 1891, trying to remain faithful to the original directions to serve the indigent.
==Enoch Pratt Mansion / Maryland Historical Society==
Enoch Pratt&#x27;s city townhouse/mansion located at 201 West Monument Street (southwest corner with Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere, purchased in 1847). The Pratt mansion was occupied by his wife Maria Louisa Hyde Pratt until her death in 1913.

In 1919, the West Monument Street townhouse/mansion was gifted to the Historical Society by Mary Washington Keyser, whose husband was a longtime Md.H.S. member. A research library, archives, and underground storage stacks were constructed in the following decade at the southern rear of the mansion replacing the former carriage house.

==Legacy==
Famous Scottish-born steel industrialist, millionaire, and noted philanthropist Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) said that &quot;Pratt was my guide and inspiration&quot; remembering the time of several days that he spent in Baltimore at Pratt&#x27;s house on West Monument Street, touring the new Free Library and conversing with Pratt and his employees and even the citizens/patrons about their mutual ideas during his visit in March 1890.

<doc id="1283602" wikidata="Q433767" url="?curid=1283602" title="Herbert Croly">
<text>Herbert David Croly (January 23, 1869 – May 17, 1930) was an intellectual leader of the progressive movement as an editor, political philosopher and a co-founder of the magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot; in early twentieth-century America. His political philosophy influenced many leading progressives including Theodore Roosevelt, Adolph Berle, as well as his close friends Judge Learned Hand and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.

His 1909 book &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; looked to the constitutional liberalism as espoused by Alexander Hamilton, combined with the radical democracy of Thomas Jefferson. The book influenced contemporaneous progressive thought, shaping the ideas of many intellectuals and political leaders, including then ex-President Theodore Roosevelt. Calling themselves &quot;The New Nationalists&quot;, Croly and Walter Weyl sought to remedy the relatively weak national institutions with a strong federal government. He promoted a strong army and navy and attacked pacifists who thought democracy at home and peace abroad was best served by keeping America weak.

Croly was one of the founders of modern liberalism in the United States, especially through his books, essays and a highly influential magazine founded in 1914, &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In his 1914 book &quot;Progressive Democracy&quot;, Croly rejected the thesis that the American liberal tradition was inhospitable to anti-capitalist alternatives. He drew from the American past a history of resistance to capitalist wage relations that was fundamentally liberal, and he reclaimed an idea that progressives had allowed to lapse—that working for wages was a lesser form of liberty. Increasingly skeptical of the capacity of social welfare legislation to remedy social ills, Croly argued that America&#x27;s liberal promise could be redeemed only by syndicalist reforms involving workplace democracy. His liberal goals were part of his commitment to American republicanism.

==Family==
Herbert Croly was born in Manhattan, New York City in 1869 to journalists Jane Cunningham Croly—better known by her pseudonym &quot;Jenny June&quot;—and David Goodman Croly.

Jane Croly was a contributor to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Messenger&quot;, and the &quot;New York World&quot;. She was the editor of &quot;Demorest&#x27;s Illustrated Monthly&quot; for 27 years. Jane Croly wrote only on the subject of women and published nine books in addition to her work as a journalist. She was one of the best-known women in America when Herbert Croly was born.

David Croly worked as a reporter for the &quot;Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Herald&quot;, as well as the editor of the &quot;New York World&quot; for 12 years. He was also a noted pamphleteer during Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s presidency.

Herbert Croly married Louise Emory on May 30, 1892. They remained married until Herbert Croly&#x27;s death in 1930. They had no children.

==Education==
Croly attended the City College of New York for one year and entered Harvard College in 1886.

David Croly soon became concerned that his son was being exposed to improper philosophical material at Harvard. The father was a follower of Auguste Comte and discouraged Herbert from studying theology and philosophers that did not agree with Comte. During Herbert’s first two years at Harvard, David became gravely ill, and in 1888 Herbert dropped out of Harvard to become his father’s private secretary and companion. His father died on April 29, 1889.

After Herbert married Louise Emory in 1892 he re-enrolled in Harvard. But, in 1893, Herbert suffered a nervous breakdown and withdrew again from Harvard. Herbert and Louise moved to Cornish, New Hampshire, where he recovered. In 1895, Herbert enrolled for the final time at Harvard at the age of 26. He excelled in his studies until 1899, when he withdrew for the last time from Harvard for unknown reasons, without a degree.

In 1910, after the publication of Herbert Croly&#x27;s book &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;, he was awarded an honorary degree by Harvard University.

==Early career==
Little is known about Croly&#x27;s immediate actions after he left Harvard in 1899. Historians believe he went to Paris intending to study philosophy, but by 1900 he had returned to New York City. After returning to America, Herbert Croly worked as an editor for an architectural magazine, &quot;The Architectural Record&quot;, from 1900 to 1906.

=== Cornish Art Colony ===
After Croly had first come to Cornish, a thriving art colony, he decided to build a house there, designed by Charles A. Platt, a prominent architect and friend of Croly through Croly&#x27;s magazine (&quot;Architectural Record&quot;). It was typical of Platt&#x27;s early style, done in an Italianate style with formal gardens and a sweeping view of Mt. Ascutney, a famous feature of many colony homes.

It was in Cornish that Croly worked on a new project: &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;, a political book he hoped would provide guidance for Americans during the transition from an agrarian to an industrialized society. When it published in 1909, Croly became a leading political thinker and prominent figure in the progressive movement.

In addition to Platt, Croly was good friends with judge Learned Hand, whose family vacationed in Cornish at their estate &quot;Low Court&quot;, and Louis Shipman, a Harvard classmate and playwright who accompanied Croly on his first visit to the colony. Shipman and his wife Ellen had a home in the neighboring town of Plainfield. It is near there that Croly and the Shipmans are buried, in the Gilkey Cemetery just north of the village.

==&quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;==
In &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;, Herbert Croly set out his argument for a progressive-liberal government in twentieth-century America. He saw democracy as the defining American trait and described democracy not as a government devoted to equal rights but as one with the aim of “bestowing a share of the responsibility and the benefits, derived from political economic association, upon the whole community.” He returned to Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton as representatives of the two main schools of American political thought. Croly famously admitted, “I shall not disguise the fact that on the whole my own preferences are on the side of Hamilton rather than of Jefferson.”

Despite his preference for Hamilton, Croly believed there were some good aspects about Jefferson’s philosophy on government. He wrote, &quot;Jefferson was filled with a sincere, indiscriminate, and unlimited faith in the American people.&quot; However, Croly viewed Jeffersonian democracy as &quot;tantamount to extreme individualism&quot;, suitable only for pre-Civil War America when the ideal Americans were pioneers pursuing individual wealth. Croly&#x27;s largest contribution to American political thought was to synthesize the two thinkers into one theory on government: Jefferson’s strong democracy achieved through Hamilton’s strong national government.

===Economy===
Croly argued that when America shifted from an agrarian economy to an industrial one, Jefferson’s vision was no longer realistic for America. Instead, Croly turned to Alexander Hamilton’s theory of big national government. Government, according to Croly, could no longer be content with protecting negative rights; it needed to actively promote the welfare of its citizens. Croly proposed a three-pronged program: the nationalization of large corporations, the strengthening of labor unions, and a strong central government.

Croly firmly believed that labor unions were “the most effective machinery which has yet been forged for the economic and social amelioration of the laboring class.” He wanted unions to have the right to negotiate contracts to ensure companies would only hire union workers. Unlike other progressives, Croly did not want the government to wage war against large corporations. He wanted the Sherman Antitrust Act repealed and replaced with a national incorporation act that would regulate and, if necessary, nationalize corporations. Croly had little sympathy for non-union workers and small businesses, declaring that “Whenever the small competitor of the large corporation is unable to keep his head above water, he should be allowed to drown.”

Croly did not support economic equality or large disparities in wealth. He believed it was the responsibility of a powerful central government to practice “constructive discrimination” on behalf of the poor. Croly&#x27;s plan included a federal inheritance rate of 20%, not the individual income tax that other progressive reformers wanted. Croly argued that compensation for work should be adjusted to “the needs of a normal and wholesome life”—an idea along the lines of the Utopian author Edward Bellamy.

===Rights===
Croly called for the adoption of Hamiltonian means to achieve Jeffersonian ends. To achieve this synthesis, however, Croly rejected Hamilton&#x27;s arguments for institutional checks on a pure national democracy, and Jefferson&#x27;s arguments for limited government. Croly rejected these limits because he saw them as too closely tied to the doctrine of individual rights. Croly wanted to transcend the doctrine of individual rights in order to create a national political community, one that would be forged by a strong but democratic national government. However, Croly failed to see the connection between Jefferson&#x27;s belief in democracy and his belief in limited government, and he failed to see the connection between Hamilton&#x27;s belief in a strong national government and his call for institutional checks on democracy. Thus, although many American reform movements have their roots in the rhetoric of Croly&#x27;s progressivism, to be effective they have had to accommodate the principles of liberal individualism that Croly wished to eradicate.

===Croly&#x27;s elite===
Croly&#x27;s strong central government needed strong individuals to lead it. His ideal was Abraham Lincoln, a person who was “something of a saint and something of a hero” and understood that democracy in America was greater than &quot;rights&quot;; it was a national ideal. Croly, like Hamilton, had a faith in the powerful few and sincerely believed that those few would remain democratic. His search for a great American leader became an obsession that was never satisfied. Croly&#x27;s notion of the elite was challenged by civil libertarians who believed Croly&#x27;s powerful few would lead to a totalitarian state. In the telling of Fred Siegel of the conservative Manhattan Institute, “For Croly, businessmen and their allies – the jack-of-all-trades latter-day Jeffersonians – were blocking the path to the bright future he envisioned for the specialists of the rising professional classes.”

===Criticism===
&quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; has received criticism from a number of angles. Many feared the underlying tones of totalitarianism or fascism. Croly insisted his government was nationalistic not socialistic. Even those who believed Croly&#x27;s government could be democratic had concerns that Croly&#x27;s vision for the country was clouded by a Republican prejudice: his writing contained several criticisms of the Democrats but almost none of the Republicans.

Croly&#x27;s book was also criticized for its lack of national focus. It focused almost entirely on problems that were of interest to those living in cities but not to rural America. The tariff, conservation, currency, banking, and agriculture all were only mentioned in passing, if at all. Connected to that was an argument that Croly&#x27;s plans were unrealistic and detached from the reality that many Americans were living.

By Croly&#x27;s death in 1930, 7,500 copies of &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; had been sold.

==After &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;==
The publication of &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; in 1909 earned Croly a lot of publicity and the attention of some important people, including Dan Hanna, Mark Hanna’s son. From 1911 to 1912, Croly worked on a biography of Hanna: &quot;Marcus Alonzo Hanna: His Life and Work&quot;. Croly needed a source of income at the time, and Dan Hanna paid Croly to write the book but reserved the right to make changes before it was published. The book had soaring praise for Mark Hanna, a conservative who saw the role of government very differently from Croly.

&quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; also attracted the attention of Roosevelt; they became friends. When Roosevelt ran for president in 1912 as a candidate for the Bull Moose party, he used the slogan &quot;New Nationalism&quot;. There is some dispute among historians whether Roosevelt took the slogan directly from &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; or if he had already developed the concept himself. Either way, Croly was credited at the time as the author.

Croly was drawn into presidential politics during the election of 1912. Croly (representing Roosevelt) took the national stage against Louis Brandeis (representing Woodrow Wilson) on the issue of trusts. Brandeis and Wilson took the side of small business, arguing that competition and equal opportunity for small businesses was at the heart of American democracy. They painted Roosevelt as the candidate of big business, and Croly was charged with arguing that big business, when properly regulated, was better for national unity and prosperity because it was efficient without the greed he associated with small business competition.

Wilson easily defeated Roosevelt and won the election. In early 1913, Croly and his wife moved to Washington, D.C. where Croly started on his next project, the book, &quot;Progressive Democracy&quot;.

==&quot;Progressive Democracy&quot;==
In &quot;Progressive Democracy&quot;, published in 1915, Croly picked up where &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; left off, shifting his focus to economic democracy and the issue of power for workers in large corporations. He wrote that his goal was to explain &quot;the needs and requirements of a genuinely popular system of representative government.&quot; For Croly, those needs and requirements included information on major political issues available to the public, energetic public debate and discussion, and the pursuit of a common voice in society.

A main concern of Croly&#x27;s in &quot;Progressive Democracy&quot; was that the United States Constitution was fundamentally inconsistent with American democratic aspirations. He perceived the Constitution as a “living Constitution,” capable in his mind of becoming something other than the Founding Fathers intended. Croly&#x27;s alternative to interpreting the Constitution as &quot;living&quot; was to eliminate it and start over, or at least substantially alter it. The basis for his argument was the belief that for progressive democracy to be successful it needed to move quickly, and the Constitution did not accommodate that. Reforms were needed that could not wait for the approval of Congress or state legislatures.

In &quot;Progressive Democracy&quot;, Croly expressed hope that reformers in 1915 were different enough from reformers of the past that they could make real differences in American politics. His call for a more progressive democracy hinged on reforming social and economic systems. He accused Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s administration of returning the country to Jeffersonian individualism, the opposite of where he thought the country should be going. He ended by appealing to Americans’ cultural and social instincts to improve their situation. Rejecting both individualism and socialism, he argued that &quot;the &#x27;scientific&#x27; forms of both individualism and socialism rest finally on a dogmatic economic determinism, which presumes to define the laws of social causation, and whose ideal necessarily counts in the submission of the individual and social will to the conditions of the social process. The progressive democratic faith carries with it the liberation of democracy from this class of social pseudo knowledge.&quot;

==&quot;The New Republic&quot;==

After Woodrow Wilson won the presidential election in 1912, &quot;Harper’s Weekly&quot; became the leading magazine for Progressive party politics. Herbert Croly believed the magazine took the wrong stance on many issues and endeavored to start a magazine of his own. In 1914, Willard Straight and his wife Dorothy Payne Whitney provided the financing for Croly&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

Croly, Walter Lippmann, and Walter Weyl were the co-founders of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. The first issue appeared on November 7, 1914. &quot;TNR&quot;’s articles represented the politics of its founders, and by 1915 the journal had attracted an audience of about 15,000, mainly young intellectuals in New York.

Theodore Roosevelt was the star of many early pieces in &quot;TNR&quot;, but by December 1914, Roosevelt had a falling out with Croly, Lippmann, and Weyl. The editors chastised Roosevelt for an attack on Wilson’s policy in Mexico. In retaliation, Roosevelt accused the editors of personal disloyalty and ended relations with them, becoming openly hostile toward Croly and the others.

World War I presented the first real policy challenge. Though they had been criticizing various Wilsonian strategies in domestic politics, the editors were hesitant to take a strong position on the war. Croly&#x27;s pragmatism set the magazine’s tone early, not blaming Germany but not openly supporting the Allies either. In the summer of 1915, &quot;TNR&quot; endorsed Norman Angell’s notion of a limited war, using techniques like seizing German assets rather than all-out war.

By late 1916, Croly had come around to some of Wilson’s policies and used &quot;TNR&quot; to declare his support of Wilson in the 1916 election. However, Croly became disillusioned toward the end of World War I and finally abandoned his loyalty to Wilson in 1918.

The period from 1918 to 1921 was difficult for &quot;TNR&quot;, and by 1921, Croly was the only original member of &quot;The New Republic&quot; that remained. Willard Straight died of influenza and pneumonia in 1918 at the age of 38, and three weeks later Randolph Bourne, a contributor to &quot;TNR&quot; from the beginning, died of the same influenza epidemic at age 32. Theodore Roosevelt died at the age of 60 only one month later, followed by Walter Weyl who died in 1919 at age 46. Walter Lippmann left the magazine in 1921 on bad terms with Croly. Around the same time, Judge Learned Hand—one of Croly&#x27;s closest friends—broke off their friendship over differences between them on the Treaty of Versailles. Although the friendship somewhat healed years later, it was a devastating loss to Croly.

In 1924 &quot;The New Republic&quot; filed for bankruptcy. Though it reorganized and began publishing again, the original spirit of the magazine would not return. Croly remained a contributor, however, until his death in 1930.

==Later life and death==

Although Croly eventually joined calls for American involvement in World War I, he became pessimistic and frustrated by the costs of war. In late 1917 and 1918, Croly began questioning his own beliefs about nationalism and democracy. The Treaty of Versailles delivered a severe blow to Croly&#x27;s progressive spirit, causing him to declare that the Paris Peace Conference was the apocalypse of liberalism.

The vicious treatment of unions during the labor movements in the 1920s was difficult for Croly, a big union supporter. The issue of prohibition put Croly&#x27;s beliefs about the role of the national government to the test. He ultimately adopted the policy Louis Brandeis suggested to him—that the federal government be responsible for interstate trafficking of alcohol but that states take responsibility for internal enforcement. But, for Croly, the challenge of how to handle prohibition was the final straw in breaking his faith in his old vision of democracy.

In 1920, Croly worked on another book called &quot;The Breach in Civilization&quot;. It was a reflection on the role of religion in the future. The result was a compilation of the ideals Croly once held but by then believed were unrealistic positions. He wrote that legislation as a solution for social issues was unimportant, and abandoned his own core philosophy that central government could create human amelioration. He condemned progressivism as a failure. As the book was on its way to the publisher, Felix Frankfurter persuaded Croly to withdraw the manuscript. It was never published, and only part of the text remains today.

Croly&#x27;s steady mental and physical decline in the 1920s culminated in a massive stroke in 1928. Though he survived, movement of the right side of his body was impaired and his ability to speak was seriously affected. For 20 painful months Croly and his wife worked toward his recovery, but it was too much to overcome. Herbert Croly died on May 17, 1930, and was buried in Plainfield, New Hampshire, alongside his wife&#x27;s gravestone.

==New Deal==
Croly died before the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal. However, historians commonly consider the New Deal to be a program that embodied many of Croly&#x27;s most central beliefs and ideas. Whether or not Roosevelt was directly influenced by Croly&#x27;s writings is debated, but many of Croly&#x27;s visions for how government should operate are tenets of the New Deal. Adolph Berle, a member of the New Deal Brain Trust, was a Bull Moose Progressive and familiar with Croly&#x27;s work.

<text>Mountain Equipment Co-op (now called 1077 Holdings Co-Operative) was a Canadian co-op that started the MEC outdoor gear retail brand. The MEC brand name, assets and store leases were purchased by the American private investment firm Kingswood Capital Management&#x27;s subsidiary Mountain Equipment Company in October 2020. 1077 Holdings Co-operative remains active to deal with the remaining claims by creditors and will be wound up at some point in the future.

Mountain Equipment Co-Op was formed as a Canadian consumers&#x27; co-operative to sell outdoor recreation gear and clothing exclusively to its members. Mountain Equipment Co-Op was notable for its commitment to environmental protection and other causes. As a co-op, Mountain Equipment Co-Op sold only to customers who held a lifetime membership, which was technically a share of the co-op. MEC (as a co-operative) was Canada&#x27;s largest supplier of outdoor equipment. Following its founding in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1971, MEC expanded across Canada and grew to operate stores in 20 cities. Once catering to mountaineers and climbers, MEC targeted a broader, more urban clientele, having added more clothing as well as cycling and yoga supplies. At its peak MEC had over 5.4 million members in Canada and internationally.

Facing mounting financial losses in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, in September 2020, without consulting its membership, the board of directors of the co-operative entered into an agreement to sell its assets to Kingswood. Following the completion of the deal in late October, Kingswood began operating the retail assets as a for-profit business.

==Organization==

MEC operated twenty-two retail stores and a &quot;Corporate &amp; Group Sales&quot; store for large orders. Some MEC stores incorporated eco-friendly designs. The Ottawa and Winnipeg stores were the first and second retail buildings in Canada to comply with Canada&#x27;s C2000 Green Building Standard, which acknowledges buildings that achieve energy consumption 50% less than similar conventional structures.

The organization designed and produced a significant proportion of its retail products and also carried other well-known brands. A significant proportion of the company&#x27;s inventory was manufactured in Asia, with names and addresses of partner-factories made publicly available on the co-op&#x27;s website. MECs&#x27; stated aim is to inspire and enable people to lead active, outdoor lifestyles. They accomplish this by selling outdoor gear, clothing and services. MEC&#x27;s head office and telephone service centre were located in Vancouver. Its distribution centres were located in Brampton, Ontario and Surrey, British Columbia.

==Governance==
Chris Strashok, the author of an academic study, remarked in 2011 that &quot;currently there are 3.3 million member owners making MEC the fourth largest democratic entity in Canada, after the governments of Canada, Ontario and Québec.&quot; Each year, every member of MEC has the opportunity to vote in the elections for its board of directors, as well as on &quot;special resolutions&quot;, through a variety of methods. Before the election period, an information package with platforms of candidates and information on resolutions is distributed. Election results are announced at the annual general meeting.

MEC is governed by a nine-member board of directors. Each year, three directors are elected to three-year terms.

MEC holds its annual general meeting in Vancouver, BC. At this meeting, the Chief Executive Officer and Committee members deliver their annual reports, and answer questions from co-op members. &quot;Other resolutions&quot; may also be brought forward and voted upon. The AGM is typically webcast and members can log in and ask questions. Typically, members recite their member numbers before speaking and these numbers are recorded in the official meeting transcript.

===Co-op structure===
Strashok remarked in 2011 that, &quot;profits are either shared among member owners based on how much the member uses the co-operative or invested back into the co-operative to improve the services provided to the members, and to sustain the business. Because of this, MEC is financially conservative, growing slowly and taking few risks. This can be challenging when the business is moving through different stages of growth. It does, however, create space for creative solutions and capital remains local benefiting the communities in which MEC operates.&quot; While the democratic structure gave one vote to one member, the financial structure and &quot;policies and legislation pertaining to business in Canada, such as how capital is classified, the classification of dividends versus patronage payments, and tax incentives for investing in co-operatives&quot; were, as noted by Strashok, ill-studied by Canadian business schools. These profits were returned to members as the &quot;patronage dividend&quot; or &quot;patronage return&quot; that can be found in yearly financial statements.

For the purposes of governance and direction at the AGM the policy was one member, one vote, regardless of how much share capital had been earned by any particular member. Share redemptions were carried out, for example through gift cards, and may have required a policy affirmation. Thus MEC found a means of treating each member as equal, regardless of purchases and shares earned. In 2020 the 5.7 million members had a paid-up capital of $192 million, well above the $5 initiation fee per member. This capital was reinvested in things like stock of merchandise and expansion of the retail empire.

===Purposes and objectives===
The purposes of the Co-op were from the outset closely intertwined with its governance model. In 2008, the commonweal of the Co-op was measured by Ponto according to Anielski&#x27;s Genuine Wealth model, while in 2011 Strashok produced a case study that focused on its promotion of sustainable development. The governance model was altered significantly from 2011, to change MEC&#x27;s focus to a more traditional accounting and retail-based business model.

===Environmental and social initiatives===
MEC had undertaken initiatives in the field of social and environmental responsibility, including:
* MEC was the first Canadian retailer to publicly disclose its list of factories and their locations, and updates this list annually.
* In May 2007 MEC became a member. MEC committed to the goal of sourcing 100% Bluesign approved fabrics by 2020. In 2019, 88% of MEC apparel and sleeping bag materials were Bluesign certified. Bluesign is a third party environmental, health and safety standard for the textiles industry.
* MEC committed to using 100% organic cotton for all MEC-branded apparel and sets yearly targets to increase its offering of products made from recycled materials.
* MEC promotes a variety of outdoor education opportunities to its members by an online calendar of events.
* In December 2007, MEC became the first retailer in Canada to stop selling water bottles and food containers containing bisphenol A, a chemical that is used to make some plastics and has been linked in some studies to increased incidence of cancer and other diseases.
* In 2008, MEC eliminated all single-use shopping bags from its stores.
* In 2010 MEC launched a new green building initiative called MEC GBS (Green Building Systems). The aim of the initiative was to ensure MEC leaders in building and operating environmentally-friendly facilities. Its Winnipeg, Longueuil, Burlington and North Vancouver stores, as well as its Montreal office received LEED Gold ratings. Its Winnipeg, Montreal and Ottawa stores also comply with C2000 standards (Natural Resources Canada&#x27;s Advanced Commercial Buildings Program).
* In March 2018, MEC announced that it would no longer stock products made by Vista Outdoor, in response to the 2018 NRA boycott, in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, because some of Vista Outdoor&#x27;s profits are derived from the production of assault weapons.

===Business initiatives===
The organization had engaged in several business initiatives:
* In 1997 MEC introduced a free of charge online gear swap where members can trade used outdoor gear.
*MEC&#x27;s distribution centre in Surrey British Columbia was opened in the fall of 2007 and was the first &quot;Green&quot; LEED (Silver) accredited distribution centre in North America.
*In November 2008 MEC opened bicycle repair shops in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal stores. The Winnipeg and Burlington stores opened their repair shops in March 2009. , sixteen stores have bike servicing.
*In the summer of 2008 MEC launched a series of annual national paddling and biking expositions named &quot;MEC Paddlefest&quot; and &quot;MEC Bikefest&quot;.

==History==

In 1971, four members of the University of British Columbia Varsity Outdoor Club conceived the idea of a mountain climbing equipment co-op when a snowstorm stranded them on Mount Baker in Washington state. Prior to this they had been purchasing gear at REI in Seattle. Other Varsity Outdoor Club members joined the plan and MEC was formed. The organization was incorporated under the British Columbia &quot;Co-operative Associations Act&quot;, with a constitution that was originally written by co-founder Jim Byers.

===1972–2000===
The MEC&#x27;s first physical store was opened in 1972 on West Hastings Street in Vancouver. By 1981, it had opened a store in Calgary and had 57,000 members. MEC established its third retail location in Toronto, in 1985. By 1992, MEC&#x27;s sales had increased to more than $35-million and had 330,000 members. Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company executive Bill Gibson was hired from outside the organization and within a few years he had opened stores in Ottawa and Edmonton.

===2000–2015===

Peter Robinson was CEO from 2000 to 2007, until he was replaced by David Labistour in 2007.

Gibson moved to the board in 2000 for a dozen years, which he chaired between 2009 and 2012.

Serratus Mountain Products Ltd. and &quot;the following substantially inactive companies&quot;: 330204 British Columbia Ltd., 340070 British Columbia Ltd. and 1314625 Ontario Limited were as of December 29, 2002 wholly owned subsidiaries of MEC.

====Festivals====
In 2006 MEC began a national program of outdoor &quot;festivals&quot; in every city in Canada that the organization had a store. MEC Paddlefest was the first of these, followed in 2008 by MEC Bikefest, which was initially run in six cities and later expanded. MEC launched its third festival, MEC Snowfest, in all MEC store cities during the winter of 2011.

====Expanded product lines====
From 2009 to 2011 MEC expanded its traditional back-country products to include urban outdoor pursuits. Road running, bicycles and yoga apparel were introduced and became significant components of MEC&#x27;s marketing focus.

In November 2009, MEC entered the bicycle retail market. This move was resisted by some suppliers of bicycle components, who refused to ship to MEC. One Quebec distributor ceased doing business with a bicycle manufacturer when that company decided to supply MEC. At that time, MEC had 11 retail outlets and about $265 million in sales. The CEO of MEC remarked that the industry had been given two years&#x27; notice about MEC&#x27;s plans to enter the bicycle market. For its initial bicycles offered, MEC contracted with a Taiwanese manufacturer to build a bicycle line under MEC&#x27;s own brand. MEC planned to sell $4 million worth of bicycles in its first year.

In November 2009 MEC began selling MEC-branded bikes in seven stores: Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Burlington, Toronto, Montreal and Longueuil. In 2015, MEC offered 58 different models including road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid and urban bikes. Some models are designed specifically for women or children. In 2012 MEC also began selling a selection of Ghost Bikes, in late 2013 added Ridley Bikes who made the choice to bet on the success of MEC instead of existing distributor Live To Play Sports, and Intense Bicycles in early 2017.

====Business model opposition====
In November 2010, as the MEC petitioned North Vancouver for permission to re-zone a property for expansion of its retail operation there, Jayson Faulkner, a competitor who owned &quot;Escape Route&quot;, took issue with the income tax rules under which the MEC was able to &quot;amass hundreds of millions of dollars in patronage dividends that were never taxed or paid out to members, thus creating a huge pool of cash to fund its dramatic expansion.&quot; Faulkner wrote that &quot;MEC is able to generate working capital at 10x the rate of all its competitors... MEC is absolutely no different than any other very large corporation operating in Canada. They are an aggressive, predatory competitor who will do whatever it takes to ensure they continue to grow and eat up market share, which is already 70-80% in some product categories... They have in the past and present, undertaken decisions and policies that will aggressively protect their own interests. “Lead pipe” capitalism is alive and well at MEC.&quot; The petition succeeded.

====Rebranding====
In 2012, when MEC had 15 stores, its marketing name was changed from Mountain Equipment Co-op to just MEC, to reflect the changed focus of the organization.

On 18 June 2013, Mountain Equipment rebranded their logo, replacing the twin mountain peaks with a green square containing the text &quot;MEC&quot; in bold.

In 2013 the &quot;earnings before patronage return and income taxes&quot; was $10 million, and in 2014 was $8 million, on sales that year of $336 million; cost of sales was $226 million and cost of administration was $105 million.

====Board governance changes====
Over the four-year period to 2011–2015, the board of directors made it increasingly difficult for members lacking specific educational and experience qualifications to run for board membership. Former board chairman Anders Ourom, who had been a member of the MEC board for nine years, was even disqualified for election in 2012, as unqualified. Former board chairman Chris McNeil, who had served on the board for 20 years, said, &quot;if there are too many people with sophisticated backgrounds, they will have a mindset or bias there because of the type of person you&#x27;re asking for.&quot; MEC co-founder Jim Byers, observed, &quot;they&#x27;ve become captured by the very retail structures that we fought against.&quot; Governance consultant Mark Latham said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think members&#x27; interests are well protected by the governance as it is now.&quot; By this time the board was able to disqualify board candidates and disregard member resolutions it disliked.

In 2013, &quot;the board required that director candidates have board or senior management experience &#x27;in a complex organization&#x27;. For the 2016 election, the board requires directors to have that experience &#x27;in an organization of comparable complexity to MEC&#x27;.&quot; MEC CEO David Labistour said that pre-selection of board candidates &quot;offers [the] membership an informed election&quot; that is both transparent and &quot;in line with the health of the organization.&quot; Concurrently, the board was given a hefty pay raise. In 2015, the chair made more than $58,000, as compared to 2011 when he was compensated $30,500.

Democratic remedies available to MEC members were curtailed during the same period. In 2013, &quot;the board increased the number of signatures required to get a motion placed before the membership to 500 from five&quot; It was noted that &quot;now, even if a special resolution has the required number of signatures, the board can still refuse to put it on the ballot if two-thirds of directors are opposed.&quot;

In 2015, MEC had 18 stores and had sales of $336 million. Its product lineup was broadened to include &quot;more mainstream items such as road running shoes and downhill skis&quot;, and it aimed to better serve a &quot;younger, more multicultural and female&quot; clientele. CEO Labistour observed that the values of the &quot;white Anglo-Saxon male&quot; were being obliterated and, to cope with the changed circumstances of the Canadian retail environment, he changed the mission of the organization. As of 2014 year end, subsidiary 1314625 Ontario Limited was &quot;substantially inactive&quot; according to the audit firm of KPMG.

===2015–2019===
A change in mission occurred while Bill Gibson was MEC&#x27;s board chair, as the co-op incorporated urban pursuits like road running, cycling and yoga into the product line. By 2015, products also included downhill skis, snowboards and accessories. MEC had formerly focused on &quot;self-propelled outdoor wilderness activities&quot; and these new product lines made it a competitor in the urban sports retail market under CEO Labistour. MEC had positioned itself as a competitor to the Forzani Group and Walmart Canada, and this attracted complaints from retailers like Sporting Life, whose co-founder David Russell noted that as a co-op, MEC had considerable tax advantages.

In 2017, it was reported that 36% of the products sold by the MEC were its own brand. The organization had 22 retail stores and 2,450 employees. Kelowna, Laval, South Edmonton and North York had brand-new MEC stores and the store in London, Ontario had been relocated. The North York store was the third store in the Greater Toronto Area, while Kelowna was the first store added in the Okanagan. In 2016 the fiscal year was changed from end-December to end-February. The co-op planned to open a new store in Kitchener, and relocate the stores in Edmonton and Quebec City in the spring of 2017. Planning was also underway for a relocated Toronto store for the fall of 2018, a new Calgary South store in the fall of 2018, relocation of the Vancouver store and the opening of a new store in west Calgary for the fall of 2019.

On August 10, 2017, it was reported by the Corporate Registrar of BC that as of August 2, &quot;1314625 Ontario Limited&quot; had been listed as an extraprovincial company having business as a foreign entity in BC.

===2020 financial difficulties and sale of assets===
In November 2018, South African-born CEO David Labistour announced his plans to leave MEC, after 11 years as CEO. Between 2003 and 2008, he had been employed by the firm as &quot;Chief Product Officer&quot;. Labistour grew the company&#x27;s share ownership from 2.7 million members to 5.1 million members and opened 11 new retail locations. Ellen Pekeles was then chair of the Board of Directors.

In May 2019 the former chief financial officer at Best Buy Canada, Philippe Arrata, was appointed as CEO of MEC. Arrata had been an MEC board member between 2015 and 2018, and was also an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Sauder School of Business.

In December 2019, MEC announced a net loss of $11.5 million for the fiscal year that had ended February 24, 2019, which included restructuring charges of $8.5 million. This compared to net earnings of $11.7 million a year earlier.

In May 2020 Steve Grant, a former MEC staff member and former member of the board of directors, along with other long-term members, accused the MEC board of rigging its own elections since 2012, to allow it to stack the board with its own preferred members. The board had amended its own rules to allow it to recommend candidates on the ballot that it wanted elected and exclude candidates it deemed unqualified.

As of September 14, 2020, MEC owed a syndicate of lenders $74 million. It had suffered losses and laid off 900 employees, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic. MEC expected to owe $92.4 million by the end of November. Its year-end financial statement indicates that had &quot;lost $11.487 million in 2019 on sales of $462 million&quot;, partly due to COVID-19. At that time, the co-op had 5 million members.

====Sale of the co-op assets====
On September 14, 2020, it was announced that MEC&#x27;s assets, including the majority of its retail stores, would be acquired by private equity firm Kingswood Capital Management, LP in a deal under the federal Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act. Kingswood Capital Management plans to retain at least 17 of the 22 existing stores as well as up to 75% of the staff and operate the stores as a chain, using the existing MEC name and branding. Following the completion of the sale, the co-operative itself will continue to formally exist for the time being, but its retail activities will cease. The incoming CEO Eric Claus stated that it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that members would receive their $5 shares back. Staff cuts and closures of at least five locations are planned. The fate of a proposed location in Saskatoon was left unclear.

The decision to sell its assets to Kingswood was met with objection from some co-op members. The board of directors had not consulted MEC members about the sale nor even informed them about it. The board had also not consulted members on a possible rights issue deal, to make an internal offer to refloat the co-op. A petition was started on Change.org &quot;calling on the MEC Board of Directors to cancel the deal, and hold immediate open, fair and democratic board elections&quot;. It had accumulated 73,600 signatures in its first four days. By September 26, 2020 the petition had exceeded 136,000 signatures.

In an official announcement on September 18, 2020 Judi Richardson, Chair of the MEC Board of Directors, addressed members, writing, &quot;We recognize this has been an unsettling week for members. The sale of MEC&#x27;s business, and the decision to move the business away from the co-operative model was, after all, a very difficult decision – but it was the right one. Facing a stark choice, we chose to preserve employment opportunities, a larger store presence, and a commitment to MEC&#x27;s ethos rather than fold up the MEC tent for good.&quot; In explaining why there was no communication with members on the sale she indicated that the board had prioritized &quot;preserving jobs and saving MEC from bankruptcy or liquidation. In short, we prioritized MEC&#x27;s survival.&quot; She indicated that while under CCAA protection, &quot;a member vote (or in the case of corporations, a shareholder vote) is not required&quot; to sell the assets of the organization.

MEC founding board member Sara Golling said in a September 18, 2020 interview that she felt &quot;grief and betrayal&quot; at the sale of the co-op&#x27;s assets to a private US investment firm. She stated, &quot;MEC was a co-op, and one of the co-operative principles is democratic member control. The members were never consulted about this. We were never warned just how bad conditions were for MEC. We knew it was bad but we had rather hoped [the co-op] could survive this rough patch. We weren&#x27;t given any voice at all in what happened. We were totally ignored by the board when perhaps we could have helped.&quot; When asked, &quot;would you shop at MEC again? Golling replied, &quot;At this point, I kind of doubt it. Why would I? I feel so disappointed. So betrayed.&quot;

On September 21, a group of shareholders announced that it had raised $50,000 through a GoFundMe campaign in order to be represented in the CCAA process by Victory Square Law Office of Vancouver, and in order &quot;to hold an emergency members&#x27; meeting to replace the board of directors&quot;. Co-operatives and Mutuals Canada and the British Columbia Co-op Association asked government to &quot;make sure legislation governing co-ops has been respected in the deal,&quot; and questioned the use of the CCAA in relation to the BC Co-operative Association Act.

On September 24, it was reported that Robert Wallis, the board member who chaired the special committee that sought from March 2020 a &quot;strategic alternative&quot; to its own management filed an affidavit in which the then-current board said that it considered &quot;impractical to impossible&quot; an early disclosure to shareholders of the difficulties encountered by the then-current board with their continued management of the retail business, which then included a subsidiary, 1314625 Ontario Limited. The then-current board found &quot;negligible&quot; the chance that shareholders might raise sufficient funds. The burn rate of the money-losing business was then approximately $1.6 million per week. The Wallis affidavit restated the losses for year 2018-2019 as $31.4 million as opposed to the $11.5 million previously published, and disclosed that $24.5 million had been lost in the 2019-2020 business year. The Wallis affidavit listed at great length the alternatives sought by the special committee, and stated that full and fair disclosure to shareholders as part of a rights issue &quot;could have had a negative impact on MEC&#x27;s business, including its relationships with suppliers and landlords and its search for new financing or for a buyer.&quot; The conduct of the special committee was influenced by the participation of a Financial Advisor (FTI Consulting) who were retained by the Royal Bank of Canada, who were lead banker in the lenders&#x27; consortium.

On September 22, the court-appointed monitor, Alvarez &amp; Marsal Canada Inc, urged the BC Supreme Court to endorse the $110 million sale to Kingswood in a hearing that was scheduled to occur on September 28. The Globe and Mail reported that between February 23 and September 6, 2020, MEC had a net loss of $20.9 million on sales of $162.8 million. The financial advisor to the liquidation process &quot;contacted 158 parties; nine of them ultimately signed a letter of intent contemplating an acquisition of most or all of the assets.&quot; MEC owned outright six of 22 retail locations: North York, North Vancouver, Ottawa, Burlington, Calgary and Winnipeg, which had a collective book value of $65.9 million. The Surrey distribution centre had a book value of $24.4 million.

On September 25 it was disclosed in the &quot;Save MEC&quot; Notice of Application for intervenor status that the stakeholding of the 5.7 million members amounted to $192 million, or an average of $33 per member, who represented 22% of the working-age population of Canada. On September 28, the current management responded in a court filing, which said they doubted the ability of &quot;Save MEC&quot; to address the significant &quot;cash flow issues, noting that the proposed sources of potential funding don&#x27;t involve concrete commitments or realistic options&quot; and remarked that they feared &quot;the proposed adjournment would put the deal (with Kingswood) in jeopardy.&quot;

<text>Springfield was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by the province&#x27;s first electoral redistribution in 1874 and existed until 2011, except for the period from 1914 to 1920.

Springfield was located to the immediate east of the City of Winnipeg. It was bordered to the north by Selkirk and Gimli, to the east by Lac Du Bonnet and to the south by La Verendrye. The riding included the municipalities of Springfield and East St. Paul, as well as Anola, Dugald, Birds Hill and Oakbank. Before 1989, the riding stretched as far as the Ontario border.

In 1914, the riding was abolished into St. Clements and Elmwood. In 1920, it was recreated out of Elmwood. 

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,599. In 1999, the average family income was $67,794, and the unemployment rate was 4.50%. Manufacturing accounted for 12% of all industry in the riding, followed by 11% in the service sector. Springfield had significant Ukrainian and German populations, at 9% and 8% respectively.

Springfield was represented by various political parties over its long history, without any one party dominating for an extended period of time. This pattern hd begun to change, as the riding had been represented by the Progressive Conservatives since 1990, and the last member, Member of the Legislative Assembly, Ron Schuler, was re-elected with over 60% of the vote in 2003. The seat was considered safe for the Progressive Conservatives.

Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was dissolved into La Verendrye and the new riding of St. Paul. This took effect for the 2011 election.

She had established herself as a leading actress of the 1980s and early 1990s. Part of the Bhatt family of Indian cinema, she is married to film director Mahesh Bhatt and is the mother of actress Alia Bhatt. 

She made her acting debut as Rosemary in &quot;36 Chowringhee Lane&quot; (1981). Her breakthrough came with drama film &quot;Saaransh&quot; (1984), earning a nomination for the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Award for Best Actress and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. Razdan&#x27;s other notable works includes &quot;Mandi&quot; (1983), &quot;Trikal&quot; (1985), &quot;Khamosh&quot; (1985), &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot; (1998), &quot;Raazi&quot; (2018), and &quot;Yours Truly&quot; (2018). Razdan has also starred in many OTT series including, &quot;The Verdict - State vs Nanavati&quot;, &quot;Out of Love&quot;, &quot;This Way Up&quot;, and &quot;Call My Agent: Bollywood&quot;.

==Early life==
Soni Razdan was born on 25 October 1956 in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, England to a British mother of German descent, Gertrude Hoelzer and an Indian father of Kashmiri Pandit descent, Narendra Nath Razdan.

Soni Razdan grew up in Bombay, India.

==Career==
===Early work and debut (1991–1998)===

Razdan started her career in English theatre with John Fowles&#x27; &quot;The Collector&quot; and her Hindi stage career with &quot;Bund Darvaze&quot;, Satyadev Dubey&#x27;s adaptation of Jean Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot;. Her photos were seen by Franco Zeffirelli who wanted to cast her as Mary in his miniseries, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. The role, however, was given to Olivia Hussey and Razdan was cast as a young grieving mother as well as appearing as an extra in other scenes. 

Razdan debuted in Hindi films in a supporting role with the 1981 film &quot;36 Chowringhee Lane&quot; starring Jennifer Kendal. It also marked the directorial debut of Aparna Sen, who had until then been known as a leading actress of Bengali cinema. Razdan garnered mainstream attention for her appearance in the film. &quot;36 Chowringhee Lane&quot; was also entered in the first edition of the Manila International Film Festival, where it won the top prize. Scholar Wimal Dissanayake sees the film as a portrayal of the patriarchal social system: &quot;The film portrays the plight of a lonely woman in a society that cares little for questions of female subjectivity and self-fulfillment. In popular culture the title of the film has become symbolic of the city of Kolkata, particularly its cuisine. A Bangalore restaurant is called 36 Chowringhee Lane. A fast-food chain in Delhi is called 34 Chowringhee Lane. Then she also appeared in Ahista Ahista directed by Esmayeel Shroff. It is a remake of the Kannada film &quot;Gejje Pooje&quot;. 

In 1983, she appeared in film called &quot;Mandi&quot; directed by Shyam Benegal. Based on a classic Urdu short story Aanandi by writer Ghulam Abbas, the film narrates the story of a brothel, situated in the heart of a city, an area that some politicians want for its prime locality. The film is a satirical comedy on politics and prostitution. Her major breakthrough came in 1984 film &quot;Saaransh&quot;. It is about an elderly Maharashtrian couple living in Mumbai who come to terms with the loss of their only son. It was directed by her now husband Mahesh Bhatt. It was also chosen as India&#x27;s official entry for the 1985 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film but it was not nominated. Her performance in the film was critically appreciated by the audience for which she earned a nomination for the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Award for Best Actress and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1985, Razdan had two release in the year which was the Historical drama &quot;Trikal&quot; (alongside Leela Naidu, Naseeruddin Shah and Neena Gupta) and the Thriller &quot;Khamosh&quot; (alongside Shabana Azmi and again with Naseeruddin Shah), both of which were critically and commercially successful. In 1986, Razdan starred in an English-language Indian film named &quot;On Wings of Fire&quot;. From 1990-1993, Razdan appeared in 6 films. Including — &quot;Daddy&quot;, &quot;Sadak&quot;, &quot;Saathi&quot;, &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Gumrah&quot;, and &quot;Gunaah&quot;. Mostly she appeared as a supporting roles.

In 1998, Razdan appeared as a lead in a Hollywood film named &quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;, co-starring Roshan Seth and directed by Sturla Gunnarsson. The story, based on the novel of the same name written by Rohinton Mistry. The film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival.

===Career slump and hiatus (2001–2019)===
In 2001, she appeared in the comedy film, &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot;. &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot; premiered in the Marché du Film section of the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and went on to win the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival and receive a Golden Globe Award nomination while grossing over $30 million internationally at the box office. A musical based on the film premiered on Broadway in April 2014. In 2017, IndieWire named it the 19th best romance of the 21st century. Between 2004-2013, she appeared in many films including, &quot;Dobara&quot;, &quot;Page 3&quot;, &quot;Jaan-E-Mann&quot;, &quot;Dil Dosti Etc&quot;, &quot;Patiala House&quot;, &quot;Love Breakups Zindagi&quot;, and &quot;Shootout at Wadala&quot;.

Razdan directed a film called &quot;Love Affair&quot; that was expected to be released in 2016, but did not.
She acted in Meghna Gulzar&#x27;s &quot;Raazi&quot; which also starred her daughter Alia in the lead role. This was the first time when she shared the screen with Alia where she played the character of Alia&#x27;s mother. Soni played the lead role in the film Yours Truly where she portrayed the character of a lonely middle-aged government employee Mithi Kumar. Reviewer from &quot;The Quint&quot; writes, Sanjoy Nag uses silence as a tool to help us understand Mithi better, and Razdan embraces that silence. She is brave yet afraid, stoic yet vulnerable, lonely yet hopeful.

In 2019, she appeared in &quot;Noblemen&quot;, &quot;No Fathers in Kashmir&quot; and &quot;War&quot;.

==Personal life==

Razdan married Indian film director Mahesh Bhatt on 20 April 1986. Bhatt did not want to divorce 
his first wife, so he and Razdan converted to Islam prior to marriage and held a very private nikaah ceremony.
Upon converting to Islam Soni chose the name Sakina as her Muslim name.

She is the mother of Shaheen Bhatt (born 28 November 1988) and actress Alia Bhatt (born 15 March 1993), step mother of Pooja Bhatt &amp; Rahul Bhatt.

Razdan has stated that she has lived in India since she was a 3 month old and that she carries an Overseas Citizenship of India.
