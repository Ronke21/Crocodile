<text>Agostino Straulino (10 October 1914 – 14 December 2004) was an Italian sailor and sailboat racer, who won one Olympic gold medal and one silver medal in the Star class, and eight consecutive European championships and two world championships in this class and was world champion in the 5.5m-class.

==Biography==
Straulino was born in Lussinpiccolo (Mali Lošinj), on the island of Lussino (Lošinj) (at that time part of Austria-Hungary, but now part of Croatia).

Straulino gained his first sailing experiences as a child on the Kvarner Gulf of the northern Adriatic Sea. He later attended the Naval Academy at Livorno and embarked on a career in the Italian Navy. At the 1936 Summer Olympics he was a reserve sailor. During World War II Straulino served in the Italian Decima Flottiglia MAS during its operations in Gibraltar. After the war he became the commanding officer of the Italian training vessel &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; for some time and eventually rose to the rank of rear admiral. He first competed at the 1948 Summer Olympics and finished fifth in the Star class.

Between 1949 and 1956 Straulino won eight consecutive European championships in the starboat class. In 1952 and 1953 he was also world champion in this class. The climax of his career as a sportsman was his gold medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Four years later he won the silver medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. After his partner Nicolò Rode (also from Lussino/Lošinj) quit, Straulino continued to compete at Olympic games with his new partner Carlo Rolandi in the Star boat class (1960 Summer Olympics, Rome, fourth place) and the 5.5m-class (1964 Summer Olympics, Tokyo, fourth place). A year later he won the world championship in the 5.5m-class.

He continued to compete in regattas in bigger boats and won the One Ton Cup off Porto Cervo in 1973 and the Italian Giraglia long-distance race. Mali Lošinj pronounced him an honourable citizen . Straulino was the initiator of &quot;Lošinjska regata&quot;, a sailing competition. Straulino died in Rome in 2004.

== Non-sporting biography ==
Like most Italians living in territories which, after World War II, were ceded to the new socialist state of Yugoslavia, the property of his family was nationalized and expropriated by Tito, and despite leaving the island of his birth at a young age, Straulino was so deeply in love with his island that he was regular visitor, especially after he retired and always wanted to know what was going on Lošinj.

In line with his final wish, he was buried in the town of birth, Mali Lošinj (formerly Lussinpiccolo).

<doc id="1306252" wikidata="Q7934309" url="?curid=1306252" title="Virginia High School League">
<text>The Virginia High School League (VHSL) is the principal sanctioning organization for interscholastic athletic competition among public high schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The VHSL first sponsored debate and also continues to sponsor state championships in several academic activities.

Private and religious schools and teams of homeschooled students belong to other sanctioning organizations, the largest of which is the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association. Proposals in the Virginia General Assembly to mandate that the VHSL allow homeschooled students to compete for the public high school they would otherwise attend have failed to pass.

== History ==
The VHSL was established in 1913 by members of both the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society and the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union at the University of Virginia to serve as a debating league for the state&#x27;s high schools. During the 1910s, it expanded to over 250 schools and added championships in oral reading, baseball, basketball, and track and renamed itself the Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League.

After World War II, it adopted other sports and began standardizing officiating practices for high school sports. In 1969, it merged with the Virginia Interscholastic Association, which was a similar organization that had served African American schools around the Commonwealth during segregation. Girls&#x27; sports were added around this time. Statewide football playoffs also began in 1970.

== Organization ==
The VHSL is headquartered in Pantops Charlottesville and has 308 member schools and conducts championships in 27 different sports. Nearly 200,000 students participate in its activities annually. The VHSL is overseen by an Executive Committee elected from the principals and superintendents of the various Virginia school districts. Day-to-day affairs are handled by the Executive Director and Assistant Directors.

===Former classification, basis for regular season competition===
From 1970, the VHSL&#x27;s member schools were organized into three group classifications based on enrollment: A, AA, and AAA. Each of the three groups were split into four geographic regions, which usually contained three or four districts. District sizes vary and consist of four to eleven teams. The group of schools with the largest enrollments were in Group AAA, the group with the next largest enrollments were in Group AA, and the schools with the smallest enrollments were in Group A. Regional boundaries were different for all three groups as average school sizes vary substantially in different parts of Virginia.

Nearly all Group AAA schools were located in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Greater Richmond, with a few outliers in the Roanoke, Lynchburg, and Danville areas. Group A schools were typically found in rural areas, with the largest concentration in Southwest Virginia. Group AA schools were somewhat more widely distributed than the other two and found in rapidly growing areas like Loudoun County, in and around cities such as Roanoke, Lynchburg, Harrisonburg, and Charlottesville, and in some cities and counties which have a single high school. Unlike many state associations, districts and regions were the same for every sport with few exceptions.

Redistricting and regrouping occurred every two years. Group AAA schools typically had enrollments above 1,500 students, Group AA schools typically had from 700 to about 1,500 students, and Group A schools had fewer than 700 students. Schools could request to play up a group. Several schools in the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas competed in the Central and Eastern Regions of Group AAA instead of Group AA due to a reluctance to travel long distances in the post-season. In Southwest Virginia, some schools with Group A enrollment levels competed in Group AA due to traditionally being part of that group. Lee High School in Jonesville received a special dispensation from the VHSL to play in Group A despite having Group AA enrollment numbers due to being far away from the nearest schools in Group AA and not having substantially more students than large Group A schools.

In football, each region was further split into two divisions based on school enrollment, so statewide champions were determined in Divisions 1 through 6. Divisions 1 and 2 were for Group A with Division 2 being the one for schools with larger enrollments; 3 and 4, the Group AA schools; and 5 and 6, the Group AAA schools. The division format was first adopted in 1986 for football and was expanded in the late 2000s and early 2010s to some other sports in Groups A and AA.

Since the average enrollments of schools varied by region in each group, some schools in one region had enrollments which would have placed them in the different division of another region. Most districts contained members in both divisions of its group, and a single district had two state championship teams on a few occasions. Because of the number of schools choosing to play up, in some years a state championship team from a lower division had a greater enrollment than a state championship team in a higher division.

===2013 reclassification, basis for post-season competition===
In the 2013-2014 school year, the former three group classification system was replaced by a six group classification system with Group 1A schools having the smallest enrollments and Group 6A schools having the largest enrollments. Generally, schools which had competed in Group A have been assigned to the new Groups 1A and 2A; in Group AA, the new Groups 3A and 4A; and in Group AAA, the new Groups 5A and 6A. Unlike the former system, the VHSL intends that the group classifications will remain approximately the same size, and schools will not be allowed to compete for a state championship in a group classification above or below the one determined by their enrollment. Regrouping will occur every two years.

Many schools which had competed at the former Group AAA level, particularly in the Central and Eastern Regions, have been assigned to Groups 4A or 3A. To a lesser extent, some smaller schools from the former Group AA have been assigned to Group 2A, a few larger school from the former Group A to Group 3A, and some larger schools from the former Group AA, particularly in Loudoun County, to Group 5A.

The district system largely based on the prior group classifications has been retained for regular season competition and &quot;districts&quot; may now include schools from different group classifications to maintain local rivalries and minimize travel during the regular season. Some Group AAA and AA districts with few schools and which were geographically isolated from other districts in the same group were dissolved and their member schools assigned to districts of nearby schools with smaller enrollments.

Schools are not required to play a district rival which is at least three group classifications higher. For example, a school in Group 3A is not required to play against a school in Group 6A but is required to play against schools in Groups 5A and 4A. In some cases, no district championship is awarded when there is not a full round robin schedule of all district teams.

Schools have also been assigned to a &quot;conference&quot; of schools from the same group classification for the first round of post-season competition. There are a total of 48 conferences, designated by numbers in reverse order of the group classification numbers. (i.e. Conference 1 is in Group 6A while Conference 48 is in Group 1A.) Conferences are not uniform in the number of the member schools and almost always include schools in other districts. Only two conferences are composed solely of the members of one district. There are no uniform rules for the seeding of schools in conference competition based on regular season results.

The six groups are not divided into four regions as before. Instead, each group classification is divided into two regions of four conferences each. The two regions are designated North/South in Groups 6A, 5A, and 4A and East/West in Groups 3A, 2A, and 1A. In most team sports, the top two teams from conference playoffs advance to compete in regional playoffs. The top two teams from regional playoffs advance to a final four state playoff competition to determine the state champion.

The conferences are not used for football playoffs in ten of the twelve regions. Instead, the sixteen schools with the most VHSL points from each region compete in the regional playoffs. The exception is that the first three rounds of the playoffs in the South regions in Groups 6A and 5A are split into two sections of two conferences each with eight schools qualifying for the playoffs in each section. The two sectional champions meet for the regional championship in the fourth round.

In Groups 6A, 5A, and 4A, the two regional champions play for the state championship. (i.e. The regional championship game is also the state semi-final.) In Groups 3A, 2A, and 1A, the final four teams are cross-bracketed in the state semi-finals with the higher remaining seed in one region hosting the lower remaining seed in the other region. (i.e. No regional championship is awarded.) This format could allow two teams from the same region to play for the state championship.

==== 2023 Classification, including Class, Region and Districts, from vhsl.org ====

VHSL member schools are classified based on enrollment into six classifications, 1 through 6, with schools having an enrollment of 475 or less in the smallest (1) classification. The remainder of the League’s member schools are divided equally into fifths, with the largest schools in Class 6. Each Classification is made up of four Regions (A, B, C, D). For regular season play, schools are placed into geographically-based Districts, eliminating the need for extensive travel during the regular season. Schools begin the post-season with Regional tournaments and then State tournament play.

* Class 1 - 475 or less
* Class 2 - 476-735
* Class 3 - 736-1,060
* Class 4 - 1,133-1,540
* Class 5 - 1,541-1,950
* Class 6 - 1,951-3,777

== Athletic activities==
Athletic activities include the following:

For boys and girls: Basketball, Cross Country, Golf, Lacrosse, Gymnastics, Indoor track, Outdoor track, Soccer, Swimming/diving, Tennis, Volleyball

For boys: Baseball, Football, Wrestling

For girls: Cheerleading, Field hockey, Softball

&quot;Boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; sports will allow members of the opposite sex to participate.&quot;

== Academic activities ==
Academic activities include the following:

Creative Writing, Debate, Drama (one-act plays), Forensics (a variety of individual events), Magazines, Newspapers, Scholastic Bowl, and Yearbooks

Academic activities are coed and not considered varsity athletics by most schools. Academic activities are usually awarded different letters and honors from athletics.

The VHSL academic activities season begins in September with a series of journalism education workshops in four cities across the state that is sponsored by Jostens. The VHSL/Jostens Regional Workshops began in 2005 and target both students and advisers of newspaper, magazine, and yearbook publications. The 2007 series included stops in Virginia Beach, Richmond, Roanoke, and Dulles.

This event is followed up by what is referred to as the state journalism workshop, or the Championship Journalism Workshop in October, which is both an educational and recognition event. Held at Virginia Commonwealth University since 1989, the CJW celebrates the results of the newspaper, magazine, and yearbook evaluations that schools submit each June to the VHSL. The two-day workshop offers about 100 classes that are taught mostly by the state&#x27;s top advisers, but also by college professors, industry professionals, and recognized out-of-state advisers. Since 2005, the awards portion of this event has been held in the nearby historic Jefferson Hotel&#x27;s ballroom. State champions in newspaper, magazine, and yearbook publications are given an evaluation on their publication known as Trophy Class. Publications that receive five Trophy Class ratings in seven or fewer years are also awarded the Savedge Award for Sustained Excellence, named after renowned yearbook adviser Colonel Charles Savedge. The VHSL also annually awards the Student Journalist of the Year to a deserving senior, which comes with the Savedge scholarship.

The VHSL academic season continues with the Group A and AA One Act Theatre Festivals, traditionally held the first week of December in Charlottesville. Eight schools representing the top two in both district and regional competition present plays that are 35 or fewer minutes in length. Preferably four, but no fewer than three, judges usually consisting of both high school directors and professionals evaluate the performances and recognize both the champion and runner-up school. Also recognized are eight outstanding actors.

In February, the top eight schools that have advanced from regional competition in Groups A, AA, and AAA go to the College of William and Mary for Scholastic Bowl competition. Two four-person teams meet head-to-head in this double-elimination tournament, answering questions in mathematics, science/health, social studies, English, and miscellany (including current events, fine arts, music, entertainment and sports). There are three rounds, including two toss-up rounds where either team may answer and one round of directed questioning toward individual schools. Toss-up rounds consist of 15 questions and directed rounds include 10 questions per team. The champion and runner-up are recognized in each grouping.

The state forensics tournament occurs on a single day in late March/early April and consists of ten individual events: duo interpretation, serious dramatic interpretation, humorous dramatic interpretation, storytelling, poetry interpretation, prose interpretation, foreign extemporaneous speaking, domestic extemporaneous speaking, impromptu speaking, and original oratory. At this tournament, Group A, AA, and AAA competition occur separately, but simultaneously. The top six students in each category and in each group are recognized with the top four earning points toward a team sweepstakes. The team champion and runner-up are also recognized.

Debate is a two-day tournament in April that features four events: Student Congress, Lincoln-Douglas, Public Forum, and Policy. This competition has taken place at Liberty University since 1999. Public Forum, added in 2011, is the newest VHSL debate event. The top four individuals (or two-person policy and public forum teams) earn points toward a team sweepstakes. The team champion and runner-up are also recognized.

The VHSL academic activities season culminates with the judging of creative writing entries announced in mid-late May. In March, schools submit a folder containing six works (2 poems, 2 short stories, and 2 essays) written by six different students. These school folders have traditionally been evaluated by judges at the University of Virginia&#x27;s creative writing department. Judges award individual awards for the three categories in each group (A, AA, and AAA) as well as an overall school folder winner in each group.

The VHSL also awards the Wachovia Cup for each group to the schools which accumulate the most points across all competitions much like the NACDA Director&#x27;s Cup for college athletics. There are separate cups for athletic and academic activities.

<text>Natrone Jermaine Means (born April 26, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Diego Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Carolina Panthers from 1993 to 2000.

Means played college football for the North Carolina Tar Heels. He was selected by the Chargers in the second round (41st overall) of the 1993 NFL draft. In 1994, he was selected for the Pro Bowl during San Diego&#x27;s Super Bowl season. He is a member of the San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team.

Means was nicknamed Natrone &quot;Refried&quot; Means and, later, &quot;Natrone Means Business&quot; by ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman. He is currently an assistant coach for the Tar Heels.

==College career==
Means attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and finished his career with 605 rushing attempts of 3,074 yards (5.1 yards per rushing attempt avg.), and 34 touchdowns, and hauled in 61 receptions of 500 yards (8.19 yards per rec. avg.). He rushed for more than 1,000 yards as both a sophomore and junior.

*1990: 168 carries for 849 yards with 10 TD. 24 catches for 229 yards with 1 TD.
*1991: 201 carries for 1,030 yards with 11 TD. 23 catches for 178 yards.
*1992: 236 carries for 1,195 yards with 13 TD. 14 catches for 93 yards.

==Professional career==
Means played from 1993 to 1995 for the Chargers, and was a Pro Bowl selection in 1994 after leading his team to the Super Bowl XXIX going up against the San Francisco 49ers, only to lose 49–26. Scoring a touchdown in the Super Bowl, he broke William Perry&#x27;s record for the youngest player to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl at age 22. This was eventually broken by 21-year-old Jamal Lewis in the Super Bowl XXXV. He was waived by San Diego before the 1996 season and signed with the Jaguars. Means returned to San Diego as an unrestricted free agent in 1998, but left as a free agent for the Panthers in 2000. He retired at the end of the season in 2000.

Means was named in the San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team in 2009. He was a finalist in 2012 to be inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
In 2005, Means joined the staff of Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina as running backs coach and in 2006 was promoted to offensive coordinator. He was recruited by head coach Robert Massey, who played with Means on the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1996. Means honed his coaching skills while participating in the NFL Minority Coaching Fellowship Program during the summer months of 2003 and 2006 with the Atlanta Falcons.

In 2007, Means was the offensive coordinator at the historical powerhouse West Charlotte High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. During training camp for the 2008 season, Means again participated in the NFL Minority Coaching Fellowship Program, working with the running backs of the Carolina Panthers.

In May 2014, Means became running backs coach at Winston-Salem State University. He was the associate head coach and offensive coordinator at Winston-Salem State.

In March 2021, Means became an offensive analyst at North Carolina.

In January 2025, Means was promoted to running backs coach at North Carolina.

<doc id="1306265" wikidata="Q1076016" url="?curid=1306265" title="Chomp">
<text>Chomp is a two-player strategy game played on a rectangular grid made up of smaller square cells, which can be thought of as the blocks of a chocolate bar. The players take it in turns to choose one block and &quot;eat it&quot; (remove from the board), together with those that are below it and to its right. The top left block is &quot;poisoned&quot; and the player who eats this loses.

The chocolate-bar formulation of Chomp is due to David Gale, but an equivalent game expressed in terms of choosing divisors of a fixed integer was published earlier by Frederik Schuh.

Chomp is a special case of a poset game where the partially ordered set on which the game is played is a product of total orders with the minimal element (poisonous block) removed.

== Example game ==
Below shows the sequence of moves in a typical game starting with a 5 × 4 bar:

Player A eats two blocks from the bottom right corner; Player B eats three from the bottom row; Player A picks the block to the right of the poisoned block and eats eleven blocks; Player B eats three blocks from the remaining column, leaving only the poisoned block. Player A must eat the last block and so loses.

Note that since it is provable that player A can win when starting from a 5 × 4 bar, at least one of A&#x27;s moves is a mistake.

== Positions of the game==
The intermediate positions in an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; Chomp are integer-partitions (non-increasing sequences of positive integers) λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥···≥ λr, with λ1 ≤ &quot;n&quot;
and &quot;r&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot;. Their number is the binomial coefficient formula_1, which grows exponentially with &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.

== Winning the game ==
Chomp belongs to the category of impartial two-player perfect information games, making it also analyzable by Nim because of the Sprague–Grundy theorem.

For any rectangular starting position, other than 1×1, the first player can win. This can be shown using a strategy-stealing argument: assume that the second player has a winning strategy against any initial first-player move. Suppose then, that the first player takes only the bottom right hand square. By our assumption, the second player has a response to this which will force victory. But if such a winning response exists, the first player could have played it as their first move and thus forced victory. The second player therefore cannot have a winning strategy.

Computers can easily calculate winning moves for this game on two-dimensional boards of reasonable size. However, as the number of positions grows exponentially, this is infeasible for larger boards.

For a &quot;square&quot; starting position (i.e., &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2), the winning strategy can easily be given explicitly. The first player should present the second with an &quot;L&quot; shape of one row and one column only, of the same length, connected at the poisonous square. Then, whatever the second player does on one arm of the &quot;L&quot;, the first player replies with the same move on the second arm, always presenting the second player again with a symmetric &quot;L&quot; shape. Finally, this &quot;L&quot; will degenerate into the single poisonous square, and the second player would lose.

== Generalisations of Chomp ==
Three-dimensional Chomp has an initial chocolate bar of a cuboid of blocks indexed as (i,j,k). A move is to take a block together with any block all of whose indices are greater or equal to the corresponding index of the chosen block. In the same way Chomp can be generalised to any number of dimensions.

Chomp is sometimes described numerically. An initial natural number is given, and players alternate choosing positive divisors of the initial number, but may not choose 1 or a multiple of a previously chosen divisor. This game models &quot;n-&quot;dimensional Chomp, where the initial natural number has &quot;n&quot; prime factors and the dimensions of the Chomp board are given by the exponents of the primes in its prime factorization.
Ordinal Chomp is played on an infinite board with some of its dimensions ordinal numbers: for example a 2 × (ω + 4) bar. A move is to pick any block and remove all blocks with both indices greater than or equal the corresponding indices of the chosen block. The case of ω × ω × ω Chomp is a notable open problem; a $100 reward has been offered for finding a winning first move.

More generally, Chomp can be played on any partially ordered set with a least element. A move is to remove any element along with all larger elements. A player loses by taking the least element.

All varieties of Chomp can also be played without resorting to poison by using the misère play convention: The player who eats the final chocolate block is not poisoned, but simply loses by virtue of being the last player. This is identical to the ordinary rule when playing Chomp on its own, but differs when playing the disjunctive sum of Chomp games, where only the last final chocolate block loses.

<text>Marion Stevenson Butts Jr. (born August 1, 1966) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Diego Chargers, the New England Patriots and the Houston Oilers from 1989 to 1995.

==Professional career==
Butts was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the seventh round of the 1989 NFL Draft. He was immediately used as a starter, for the Chargers. On December 17, 1989, late in his rookie season, he rushed for 176 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs on a Chargers record 39 carries. He led the team (Chargers and Patriots) in rushing his first six seasons. He gained a career-best 1,225 yards in 1990, finishing third in the NFL in rushing yards, despite missing the final two games of the season due to injury. He was elected to the 1990 Pro Bowl. In the 1992 playoffs, Butts rushed 15 times for 119 yards and 1 touchdown against the Chiefs, setting the franchise records with 7.9 yards per carry.

In 1994, citing the new salary cap, as well as declining numbers due to a string of injuries, the Chargers traded Butts to the Patriots for a third- and a fifth-round pick.

<doc id="1306273" wikidata="Q7337121" url="?curid=1306273" title="River Bain">
<text>The River Bain is a river in Lincolnshire, England, and a tributary of the River Witham.

The Bain rises in the Lincolnshire Wolds at Ludford, a village on The Viking Way long-distance footpath, and flows through or past the villages of Burgh on Bain, Biscathorpe, Donington on Bain, Goulceby, Asterby and Hemingby before reaching the town of Horncastle where it is joined by the River Waring, which rises at Belchford, to the north east of Horncastle.

After leaving Horncastle, the Bain flows through the villages of Kirkby on Bain, Coningsby and Tattershall, and joins the Witham at Dogdyke. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and after protracted negotiation, a group of venture capitalists led by Sir Joseph Banks canalized the Bain between Horncastle and the Witham. The Horncastle Canal opened in 1802 and was an important goods route before the coming of the railway. It is no longer navigable, but is used extensively by anglers, canoeists, and naturalists.

The river contains significant populations of chub (&quot;Leuciscus cephalus&quot;), bream, roach and rudd, as well as brown trout, pike, eel, and smaller species such as miller&#x27;s thumb (&quot;Cottus gobio&quot;), gudgeon and stone loach (&quot;Nœmacheilus barbatus&quot;). It is also home to the threatened species of crayfish &quot;Austropotamobius pallipes&quot;, though there are also populations of the introduced American signal crayfish (&quot;Pasifastacus leniusculus&quot;), which competes with the native species for food.

The Bain valley was formed by a glacier in the most recent ice-age and, although small, is very obvious. The River Bain is very susceptible to flooding and many floods have occurred during its history, about once every 30–50 years, the one of the most recent being the 2007 United Kingdom floods, when the river overtopped its banks all along its course. Horncastle was particularly badly hit. The river once again broke its banks in Horncastle during Storm Babet 20th October 2023.

Settlements in the valley include Tattershall, Coningsby, Kirkby on Bain, Haltham, Roughton, Horncastle, Hemingby, Goulceby with Asterby, Donington on Bain, Burgh on Bain and Ludford.

<text>Andre Bernard Tippett Sr. (born December 27, 1959) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons with the New England Patriots. He played college football for the Iowa Hawkeyes, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American in 1981. A second-round pick in the 1982 NFL draft, Tippett was selected to five Pro Bowls and was named first-team All-Pro twice in his career. Since 2007, he has been the Patriots&#x27; executive director of community affairs. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2008. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

==Early life==
Tippett was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He attended Barringer High School in Newark, New Jersey. He first attended college and played football at Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls in 1978.

==College career==
Tippett was an All-American defensive end and a three-year letterman at the University of Iowa. He was also a two-time All-Big Ten selection (1980 and 1981). In 1981, he helped lead the Hawkeyes to their first winning season, their first Big Ten title, and first Rose Bowl in two decades. He was part of a defense that allowed only 129 points, the lowest total since 1965 and 9th-best in school history and allowed only 86.9 rushing yards a game, which still stands as the school record. The 1981 Iowa defense allowed 253 total yards a game, the fewest since 1959, making it the 4th-best defense in school history in terms of total yards. Against Northwestern on October 3, 1981, the Hawkeye defense allowed 78 total yards which stands as 6th-best in defensive performances in team history.

Tippett was a two-time first-team all-Big Ten, and a team captain in 1981. He holds the Iowa record for tackles for lost yardage in a season (20 tackles for 153 yards in 1980). He played in the Hula Bowl and the Japan Bowl in 1982, after his senior year at Iowa. He was voted a DE on Iowa&#x27;s all-time football team in 1989 as is a member of the University of Iowa&#x27;s Varsity Hall of Fame. Upon induction to the Varsity Hall of Fame, Tippett remarked, &quot;For me, this is a &#x27;Wow&#x27; . . . It is really, really special to be voted by your peers and the people who saw you play. I&#x27;m going in with some of the greatest people to ever play sports at the University of Iowa. This is one of the greatest honors I have ever had. This is a special feeling because during the three years I was there, I developed a great bond with the players and coaches.&quot;
==Professional career==
Tippett was selected by the New England Patriots in the 2nd round of the 1982 NFL draft.

Tippett is a member of the NFL&#x27;s 1980s all-decade team and was selected to five Pro Bowls in his career, earning the nod in five straight seasons from 1984 to 1988.

From 1984 to 1985, Tippett recorded the highest two-season sack total by a linebacker in NFL history, totaling 35.0 sacks during the two seasons. His 18.5 sacks in 1984 are the third most by any linebacker in a single season, while his 16.5 sacks in 1985 are tied for the sixth most by any linebacker in NFL history.

Tippett holds the Patriots&#x27; franchise record with 100.0 career sacks. He also owns the top three single-season sack performances in Patriots history (18.5 in 1984, 16.5 in 1985 and 12.5 in 1987).
He ranked seventh on the all-time sacks list, and third among linebackers, at the time of his retirement following the 1993 season. Over his career, Tippett recorded 100 sacks in 151 games, an average of 0.662 sacks per game. The mark currently ranks fourth in NFL history among linebackers.

After not recording a sack as a rookie in 1982, Tippett finished either first or second on the team in sacks in each of his final 10 seasons. He led the team in sacks six times and finished second on the team four times. Tippett recorded 30 multiple-sack games in his career and sacked a total of 41 different quarterbacks. Tippett recovered 18 opponents&#x27; fumbles during his career, tying him for first on the Patriots&#x27; all-time list (Steve Nelson). He also forced 17 fumbles in his career.

Tippett was named the AFC&#x27;s Linebacker of the Year by the NFL Players Association for three straight seasons from 1985 to 1987. He was voted to the Associated Press All-NFL First-team on two occasions (1985 and 1987) and Second-team on two other occasions (1986 and 1988). He was also named to the NFL Films All-Pro team in 1984.

He was voted the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) co-Defensive Player of the Year (with Raider Howie Long) in 1985. Additionally, he was voted the 1985 UPI AFL-AFC Defensive Player of the Year.

Tippett twice earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week awards. The first in the Patriots 20–13 win over the New York Jets as he stopped the Jets 3 times within the 10 yard line on 10–20–85. Next, he was the AFC Defensive Player of the Week in the Patriots 21–7 win over the Houston Oilers on October 18, 1987. In this victory over Houston at the Astrodome, Andre had 3 sacks, defended on a pass play and blocked a field goal attempt that was returned for a touchdown by Raymond Clayborn. He had 1.5 sacks in his final game on January 2, 1994, against the Miami Dolphins.

<text>The Distichs of Cato (Latin: &quot;Catonis Disticha&quot;, most famously known simply as Cato) is a Latin collection of proverbial wisdom and morality by an unknown author from the 3rd or 4th century AD. The &quot;Cato&quot; was the most popular medieval schoolbook for teaching Latin, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass. &quot;Cato&quot; was in common use as a Latin teaching aid as late as the 18th century, used by Benjamin Franklin. It was one of the best-known books in the Middle Ages and was translated into many languages.

==Background==
&quot;Cato&quot; was the most popular Latin textbook during the Middle Ages, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass for impressionable students. It was translated into many languages, including Norse.

Geoffrey Chaucer referred to &quot;Cato&quot; in &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, through which modern students, less versed in Latin, often first come upon it.

The &quot;Distichs of Cato&quot; was most commonly referred to as simply &quot;Cato&quot;. In the Middle Ages it was assumed the work had been written by Cato the Elder, or even Cato the Younger. Cato the Elder was assumed to have included tracts of the prose in his &quot;Carmen de Moribus&quot;, but this was found to be a later addition. It was eventually attributed to the anonymous author Dionysius Cato (also known as Catunculus) from the 3rd or 4th century AD, based upon evidence in a manuscript discussed by Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484–1558). This manuscript no longer exists, though Scaliger found it authoritative.

In 1513 Erasmus corrected and commented on the text in a new edition of his own.

Corderius made the French translation, enriching it with commentaries on classical authors. His work was aimed at children with a summary, verses and an analysis of the structure. It was actually a grammatical treatise.

There were several Spanish translations of the work of Corderius. From the first one in 1490 down to 1964, there are records of 6 Spanish translations. An authority on Michael Servetus, González Echeverría, presented at the ISHM the thesis that Servetus was actually the author of the anonymous Spanish translation of 1543 of this work of Corderius.

There were several English translations, one being that of John Kingston in 1584.

Benjamin Franklin probably studied &quot;Cato&quot; when he was at Boston Latin School. He cites &quot;Cato&quot; in &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; and believed in the moral advice with such fervor he was troubled to print James Logan&#x27;s translation called &quot;Cato&#x27;s Moral Distichs Englished in Couplets&quot; in 1735, the first in the Colonies. Of its limited need in the morally puritan New England colonies, Franklin says:

::&quot;It would be thought a Piece of Hypocrisy and pharisaical Ostentation in me, if I should say, that I print these Distichs more with a view to the Good of others than my own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot say it; for I confess, I have so great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Sense of the People of this and the neighboring Provinces, that I expect to sell a very good impression.&quot;

==&quot;Cato&quot;==
&quot;Distich&quot; means closed couplets, a style of writing with two-liners. It is a collection of moral advice, each consisting of hexameters, in four books. &quot;Cato&quot; is not particularly Christian in character, but it is monotheistic.

===Sample distichs===
2.1. If you can, even remember to help people you don&#x27;t know.&lt;br&gt;
More precious than a kingdom it is to gain friends by kindness. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
2.9. Do not disdain the powers of a small body;&lt;br&gt;
He may be strong in counsel (though) nature denies him strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
3.2. If you live rightly, do not worry about the words of bad people,&lt;br&gt;
It is not our call as to what each person says.

<doc id="1306289" wikidata="Q3802156" url="?curid=1306289" title="Irving Fryar">
<text>Irving Dale Fryar Sr. (born September 28, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons. Fryar played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. He was selected with the first overall pick of the 1984 NFL draft, becoming the second wide receiver to be taken number one overall, the first being Dave Parks in 1964. Fryar played professionally for the New England Patriots, Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Redskins of the NFL. Known for his longevity, his best seasons statistically came well into his 30s, at a time when many receivers are on the tail end of their careers, and he played for 17 seasons, retiring at the age of 39 holding several NFL longevity records for receivers.

==Early life==

Fryar grew up in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey, and played high school football at Rancocas Valley Regional High School.

==College career==
A unanimous All-American at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1983, Fryar played alongside Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier (running back) and Heisman finalist Turner Gill (quarterback).

===Statistics===
==Professional career==
Fryar was the second wide receiver to be selected first overall in an NFL draft when the New England Patriots made him the top selection of the 1984 NFL draft.

With the Patriots, Fryar saw success on a receiving corps that featured Stephen Starring and perennial Pro Bowler Stanley Morgan. He also served as the team&#x27;s primary punt returner. Following the 1985 season, in which Fryar was named to his first Pro Bowl, he played in Super Bowl XX, where he scored New England&#x27;s only touchdown in their 46–10 loss to the Chicago Bears. He was one of the few marquee players on the 1–15 1990 team, and in 1991 he had his first 1000-yard receiving season. Traded to the Dolphins in 1993 for a pair of high-round draft picks, he made an immediate impact, having two further 1000-yard seasons in 1993 and 1994, and making the Pro Bowl both years. Following the 1995 season, he signed as a free agent with the Eagles, with whom he played in a fourth and fifth Pro Bowl following the 1996 and 1997 seasons. After retiring from football briefly following the 1998 season, he was signed by the Redskins, with whom he played the final two seasons of his career.
Fryar retired from the NFL in 2001 after completing 17 NFL seasons. During that time, he caught 851 passes for 12,785 yards and 84 touchdowns, along with one rushing and three punt return touchdowns. He also gained 242 rushing yards, 2,055 yards returning punts, 505 yards on kickoff returns, and 7 fumble return yards, giving him 15,594 all-purpose yards.

Fryar&#x27;s 255 played games are the most ever for a New Jersey-born player.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Regular season ===
=== Playoffs ===
==Personal life==
Fryar has had several off-field incidents during and after his career. In 1985, he missed the AFC championship game after injuring his hand in a domestic dispute with his pregnant wife. He was arrested in 1988 on weapons charges after a New Jersey state trooper found a loaded shotgun and handgun and a hunting knife in Fryar&#x27;s car.

On November 23, 1986, Fryar separated his shoulder during a game against the Buffalo Bills. Instead of watching the rest of the game from the sidelines, Fryar left the stadium and was listening to the game while driving his car through Foxboro. He crashed into a tree and suffered a slight concussion.

His wife filed for divorce in 2014 after 29 years of marriage. They have four children.

On August 7, 2015, Fryar and his mother, Allene McGhee, were found guilty of conspiring to defraud six banks and a mortgage company by a New Jersey Superior Court jury. The prosecution maintained that Fryar and McGhee conspired with real estate consultant William Barksdale in a scheme to fraudulently obtain six home-equity loans totaling about $850,000 in November and December 2009, and a $414,000 mortgage in October 2009, using McGhee&#x27;s home as collateral in each instance. Fryar and McGhee maintain they were victims of Barksdale, who is serving a 20-month sentence in federal prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his role in the scheme, and plans to appeal.

Fryar&#x27;s son, Londen, was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2009 out of Western Michigan University.

On October 2, 2015, Pro Football Talk reported that Fryar and his mother were convicted of mortgage fraud. Fryar will receive a five-year prison sentence while his mother will receive probation. According to the New Jersey AG who oversaw the case, John Hoffman, &quot;The fact that Fryar had the means to succeed and do good things and instead chose this criminal path makes his actions all the more reprehensible&quot;.

On December 7, 2015, a NJ Judge handed up an order that Irving Fryar and his mother to pay $615,600 in restitution to five lending institutions that were cheated in a mortgage scam. Fryar and his mother, Allene McGhee, were convicted of applying for multiple mortgage loans in quick succession while using the same property as collateral. Fryar was sentenced in October to five years in prison while his mother received three years of probation. In June 2016, Fryar was released from prison after serving eight months of his sentence. He was placed under the state&#x27;s Supervision Program for non-violent offenders.

==NFL records==
* Touchdown receptions from 19 different passers
* First player to record a touchdown in 17 consecutive seasons (1984–2000) - (broken by Jerry Rice who ended up with 20 consecutive seasons with a touchdown reception)

<doc id="1306291" wikidata="Q1345042" url="?curid=1306291" title="Meles (genus)">
<text>Meles is a genus of badgers containing four living species known as Eurasian badgers, the Japanese badger (&quot;Meles anakuma&quot;), Asian badger (&quot;Meles leucurus&quot;), Caucasian badger (&quot;Meles canescens&quot;) and European badger (&quot;Meles meles&quot;). In an older categorization, they were seen as a single species with three subspecies (&quot;Meles meles anakuma&quot;, &quot;Meles meles leucurus&quot; and &quot;Meles meles meles&quot;). There are also several extinct members of the genus. They are members of the subfamily Melinae of the weasel family, Mustelidae.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Meles&quot; was erected by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1762 after Carl Linnaeus had described the Eurasian badger &quot;Meles meles&quot; in 1758. This animal had a very extensive range over most of temperate Europe and Asia and there has been much discussion as to whether it is a single or three distinct species. There are geographical differences between individuals from different parts of the range in skull structure, morphology of the first premolar teeth, and facial markings. Some authorities advocated placing European and Asian badgers in separate species, &quot;Meles meles&quot; and &quot;Meles leptorhynchus&quot; (Milne-Edwards, 1867), the boundary between the two being the Volga River. Others considered three subspecies, &quot;M. m. meles&quot; found west of the Volga, &quot;M. m. arenarius-leptorhynchus&quot; found between the Volga and Transbaikalia, and &quot;M. m. amurensis-anakuma&quot; from the Amur and Primorsky regions.

Genetic studies of mitochondrial DNA show the separation of two variants on either side of the Volga but their exact taxonomic rank remains undefined. A further study of cheek teeth from individuals across the entire range supports this division and provides confirmation that &quot;M. meles&quot; and &quot;M. anakuma&quot; are indeed separate species.

===Extant species===
===Fossils===

A further species is &quot;Meles thorali&quot; from the late Pleistocene, known only from fossil remains, specimens of which have been found at Saint-Vallier, Drôme, in southeastern France and Binagady, in Azerbaijan. These have large cheek teeth and characteristics intermediate between &quot;M. meles&quot; and &quot;M. anakuma&quot;. It is theorized that they were an ancestral species from which these two modern species diverged. Another extinct species from Europe is &quot;Meles hollitzeri&quot; from the Early Pleistocene, remains of which were found in Deutsch-Altenburg, in northeastern Austria, and Untermassfeld, in southeastern Germany.

<text>Ernst Heinrich [[Freiherr]] von Weizsäcker (25 May 1882 – 4 August 1951) was a German naval officer, diplomat and politician. He served as State Secretary at the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1943, and as its Ambassador to the Holy See from 1943 to 1945. He was a member of the prominent Weizsäcker family, and the father of German President Richard von Weizsäcker and physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker.

== Early life ==

Weizsäcker was born in 1882 in Stuttgart to Karl Hugo von Weizsäcker, who would become minister president (the equivalent of prime minister) of the Kingdom of Württemberg and raised to personal nobility in 1897, and to Paula von Meibom. In 1911, he married Marianne von Graevenitz, who belonged to the old nobility. In 1916 he became a Freiherr (Baron), as his father and his family were raised to the inheritable nobility, less than two years before the fall of the Württembergish monarchy.

== Naval career ==

In 1900, Weizsäcker joined the Imperial German Navy to become an officer, serving mainly in Berlin. In 1916, he served as Flag Lieutenant to Admiral Reinhard Scheer aboard the German flagship during the Battle of Jutland. In 1917, during the latter portion of the First World War, he earned the Iron Cross (both classes) and was the next year was promoted to &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (corvette captain) (equivalent to the British and American rank of lieutenant commander).

He was a member of the Naval Staff led by Admiral Reinhard Scheer from August 1918. From June 1919 to April 1920, he served as naval attaché to The Hague.

== Diplomatic career ==

Weizsäcker joined the German Foreign Service in 1920. He was appointed as Consul to Basel in 1921, as Councillor in Copenhagen in 1924 and was stationed in Geneva from 1927. He became head of the department for disarmament in 1928 and was appointed as envoy to Oslo in 1931 and to Bern in 1933. In 1936, as ambassador to Bern, Weizsäcker played a key role in stripping Thomas Mann of his German citizenship. He became Director of the Policy Department at the Foreign Office in 1937 and the following year he was appointed as &quot;Staatssekretär&quot; (&quot;State Secretary&quot;) -- the second ranking official after the Foreign Minister in the German Foreign Office.

He was encouraged by his superior to join the ruling National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP), which he did in 1938, and he was also awarded an honorary rank in the Schutzstaffel (SS). In 1938, Weizsäcker was opposed to the general trend in German foreign policy of attacking Czechoslovakia for fear that it might cause a general war that Germany would lose. He had no moral objections to the idea of destroying Czechoslovakia, only the timing of the attack. Weizsäcker had some contacts with members of the German opposition, but during his interrogations after the war, he never claimed to be a member of the resistance. It was only after he was brought to trial that Weizsäcker first claimed to be an anti-Nazi working with all his heart and might to overthrow the Nazi regime.

On 19 August 1938, Weizsäcker wrote in a memo to Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop: &quot;I again opposed the whole theory of (an attack on Czechoslovakia) and observed that we should have to wait political developments until the English lose interest in the Czech matter and would tolerate our action, before we could tackle the affair without risk&quot;. Weizsäcker never sent his memo to Ribbentrop. Together with the &quot;Abwehr&quot; chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and the Army Chief of Staff, General Ludwig Beck, Weizsäcker was a leader of the antiwar group in the German government, which was determined to avoid a war in 1938 that it felt Germany would lose. The group was not necessarily committed to the overthrow of the regime but was loosely allied to another more radical group, the &quot;anti-Nazi&quot; faction centred on Colonel Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, which wanted to use the crisis as an excuse for executing a putsch to overthrow the regime.

The divergent aims between these two factions produced considerable tension. The historian Eckart Conze stated in a 2010 interview: &quot;An overthrow of Hitler was out of the question. The group wanted to avoid a major war and the potential catastrophic consequences for Germany. Their goal wasn&#x27;t to get rid of the dictator but, as they saw it, to bring him to his senses&quot;.

Weizsäcker was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer on 30 January 1942.

=== Ambassador to the Vatican ===

After the German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the changing German war fortunes, and following his own request, Weizsäcker resigned as State Secretary and was appointed German Ambassador to the Holy See from 1943 to 1945.

When received by the Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione on 6 January 1944, Weizsäcker stated, &quot;If Germany as a bulwark against communism should fall, all of Europe will become communist&quot;. To this, Maglione replied, &quot;What a misfortune, that Germany with its antireligious policies has stirred up such concerns&quot;. Similar representations were repeated by Weizsäcker to Monsignore Giovanni Battista Montini, later Pope Paul VI.

Weizsäcker&#x27;s record at the Vatican was mixed. In Berlin, he had refused to accept a papal note protesting against the treatment of occupied Poland. During the German occupation of Rome, Weizsäcker did almost nothing to stop the deportation of Jews, albeit he helped individuals to avoid persecution, and helped to free Rome from all German military bases in an effort to discourage Allied bombing of the city. He also advised the Foreign Office that drafting Jews for labour camps inside Italy would be less likely to draw a papal protest than deporting them. According to Richard J. Evans, Weizsäcker shared the opinion of Ulrich von Hassell that the Final Solution was a &quot;devilish campaign&quot;.

&quot;His messages and documents to Berlin were nothing but lies,&quot; his coworker Albrecht von Kessel later said. In those messages to Berlin, Weizsäcker purposely painted Pope Pius XII as mild, diplomatic, indecisive and pro-German to help the Pope and to avoid anti-German sentiment in Italy. Like the commanding Waffen SS General Karl Wolff, Weizsäcker was clearly opposed to Hitler&#x27;s plan to occupy the Vatican during which Weizsäcker feared the Pope being shot &quot;fleeing while avoiding arrest&quot;.
Weizsäcker continued to present the Vatican with anticommunist slogans, and he both threatened a separate Soviet-German peace and requested from Monsignore Domenico Tardini the immediate mounting of a papal peace initiative to end the war in the West so that Germany could finish communism in the East. Tardini saw that as a transparent effort to obtain a military solution.

Like several other German officials, Weizsäcker attempted to negotiate the survival of some segment of the government and to avoid the unconditional surrender of Germany, but his efforts failed in bringing up the subject of &quot;a German transition government, and the likelihood of his being a member of it&quot;.

==Postwar==

After the end of the war, Weizsäcker initially remained in the Vatican City with his wife, as a guest of the Pope and a member of the diplomatic corps. He did not return to Germany until 1946. Weizsäcker was arrested on 25 July 1947 in Nuremberg and was put on trial in the Ministries Trial, also known as the Wilhelmstrasse Trial, after the location of the German Foreign Office in Berlin. The Ministries Trial was one of 12 trials conducted by Nuremberg Military Tribunals in the American occupation zone. The American military tribunals started before and finished during the Berlin Blockade confrontation with the Soviets and proceeded without participation of the Soviet Union.

Weizsäcker&#x27;s supporters claimed that he had been closely associated with the anti-Nazi resistance and a moderate force at the Foreign Office during the war.

Weizsäcker was charged with active cooperation with the deportation of French Jews to Auschwitz, as a crime against humanity. Weizsäcker, with the assistance of his son, the future German President Richard von Weizsäcker, who appeared as his assistant defence counsel (Richard was a law student during the trial), claimed that he had no knowledge of the purpose for which Auschwitz had been designed and believed that Jewish prisoners would face less danger if they were deported to the East.

In 1949, Weizsäcker was found guilty of crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and sentenced to 7 years in prison. Winston Churchill called his sentence a &quot;deadly error&quot;. The same year, the sentence was reduced to 5 years, after his conviction for crimes against peace was overturned. In October 1950, after 3 years and 3 months of detention, he obtained an early release from prison in Landsberg after a new examination of his case by the Legislative Affairs Office of the US High Commissioner for Germany, John J. McCloy. Weizsäcker subsequently published his memoirs, written in prison, in which he portrayed himself as a supporter of the German Resistance.

==Death and legacy==

Weizsäcker died of a stroke on August 4, 1951, at the age of 69.

In 2010, historian Eckart Conze assessed the belief that the German Foreign Office had no involvement with Nazi war crimes in an interview:&quot;The legend stems from individuals associated with the Weizsäcker defense. Former diplomats, such as the brothers Erich and Theo Kordt, played a key role in the effort, as did other members of the traditional upper class, which Weizsäcker represented. One of them was his defense lawyer, Hellmut Becker, the son of the Prussian culture minister, Carl Heinrich Becker, and another was Marion Gräfin Dönhoff, a young journalist who sharply criticized the trial in &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. They all knew that if they succeeded in exonerating Weizsäcker, they would have rehabilitated the national conservative, aristocratic and bourgeois upper class.&quot;

<doc id="1306297" wikidata="Q3177405" url="?curid=1306297" title="Jerome Brown">
<text>Willie Jerome Brown III (February 4, 1965 – June 25, 1992) was an American professional football defensive tackle who played for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played his entire five-year NFL career with the Eagles from 1987 to 1991, before his death just before the 1992 season. He was selected to two Pro Bowls in 1990 and 1991. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes.

==Early life and education==
Brown graduated from Hernando High School in Brooksville, Florida, where he was often seen in the off season running laps around the track. In June 1988, he received praise for his calm demeanor as he helped disperse a group of Ku Klux Klan protesters in Brooksville, Florida.

==College career==
Brown played college football at the University of Miami, where he was a standout player for one of college football&#x27;s most successful and perhaps its most dominant program.

Among his more notable moments as a Miami player, five days before the 1987 Fiesta Bowl, at a promotional Fiesta Bowl dinner with the Penn State team, Brown led a walkout by the Miami players. Leading the walkout, he asked: &quot;Did the Japanese go and sit down and have dinner with Pearl Harbor before they bombed them?&quot; Brown and his teammates felt that the Penn State players had disrespected them by openly mocking Miami&#x27;s coach, Jimmy Johnson, at a pre-game banquet. Penn State beat the heavily favored Hurricanes 14–10, and were declared National Champions.

Days earlier, Brown and fellow University of Miami player Dan Sileo drew even greater national controversy when each were seen deplaning a chartered University of Miami plane at Phoenix&#x27;s Sky Harbor International Airport, wearing Battle Dress Uniforms. He graduated from the University of Miami in 1987.

==Professional career==
Brown was drafted in the first round (ninth overall) of the 1987 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. During his five-year professional career with the Eagles, he was twice selected to the Pro Bowl (in 1990 and 1991).

==Death and legacy==
Brown died on June 25, 1992, at the age of 27, following an automobile accident in Brooksville, Florida, in which both he and his 12-year-old nephew were killed when Brown lost control of his ZR1 Chevrolet Corvette at high speed and crashed into a palm tree. Brown was buried in his hometown of Brooksville.

In 2000, the Jerome Brown Community Center was opened in Brooksville in memory of Brown.

Brown&#x27;s son Dee Brown (born 1982) was drafted in the 10th round of the 2005 MLB Draft by the Washington Nationals. He played four seasons of minor league baseball as an outfielder in the Nationals farm system and another two seasons with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the independent Northern League.

Brown and former teammate Reggie White were documented together in an episode of the NFL Network series &quot;A Football Life&quot; that aired in 2011. White, who died in 2004, was invited to speak at a Billy Graham Crusade being held in Philadelphia the day Brown was killed and was informed just before he went on stage of his friend&#x27;s death. When he came up to the pulpit to speak, White deviated from his prepared remarks and his speech opened with the following:

An emotional White, pausing to wipe tears from his eyes, continued as the crowd gasped in shock at hearing that Brown was dead. He said that Brown was one of the best men he ever knew, praised his family, and called him one of his best friends.

===Legacy===

Along with teammate Reggie White, Brown helped anchor an Eagles defense that intimidated and dominated offenses of the late 1980s and early 1990s. By the end of the 1991 season, Brown had established himself as one of the league&#x27;s premier defensive tackles, being elected as an All-Pro for a second consecutive year. Brown was not only a fan favorite, but a favorite of his first NFL head coach Buddy Ryan, who once remarked, &quot;if you had 45 Jerome Browns, you would win every game.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s jersey number (#99) was retired by the Eagles on September 6, 1992, in an emotional pre-game ceremony at Veterans Stadium, prior to the Eagles&#x27; first game of the 1992 season. After his death, Eagles players and fans started the unofficial motto &quot;Bring it home for Jerome,&quot; an indirect reference among Eagles fans to bringing a Super Bowl title to the city in Brown&#x27;s honor. The Eagles would win Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, which would have been Brown&#x27;s 53rd birthday.

Brown is mentioned in The Wonder Years track &quot;We Could Die Like This&quot; off their 4th album &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; with the lyrics: &quot;We watched the &#x27;92 Birds take the field without Jerome Brown&quot;.

<text>Endeavour Foundation is a not-for-profit charity headquartered in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is one of the largest disability service providers in Australia, employing over 1800 staff and supported by 1200 volunteers.

The organisation was established in Queensland in 1951 to support children with an intellectual disability. Endeavour Foundation now supports over 4,000 people with a disability across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to live active and fulfilling lives at home, to find employment compatible with their abilities and to engage more broadly within the community.

Endeavour Foundation continues to advocate, innovate and push the boundaries for its customers, encouraging them to live their lives to the full and working closely with them to help make their possibilities a reality.

In 2014, the Endeavour Foundation was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards.

==History==
Endeavour Foundation was founded in 1951 by a group of parents of children with an intellectual disability. Initially called the Queensland Sub-Normal Children&#x27;s Welfare Association, the group&#x27;s ambition was to establish training centres to teach the children to do simple unskilled work. The group received the patronage of Sir Fred Schonell, the first Professor of Education and later Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Schonell was Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s first President and extended his research interest in education for people with a disability by creating the Remedial Education Centre (now known as the Fred and Eleanor Schonell Special Education Research Centre), one of the first of its kind in the world.

In its first two years of operation, the organisation registered 300 children with an intellectual disability. The Association&#x27;s first school and support group were established in a member&#x27;s home. In June 1953, the association established its first centre in Coorparoo in Brisbane with a teacher to provide basic education to the children, putting into practice ideas developed at the University of Queensland. By 1954, the Association had grown beyond Brisbane, with the formation of the first regional sub-committees in Toowoomba and Ipswich. In 1955, the centre moved to a large property in Bowen Hills in Brisbane.

Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s Head Office, one regional office and a non-vocational day service were previously based at the location, now known as Schonell House in Jordan Terrace, which was sold to property developer BMI Group in the late 2000s and has since been on sold.

The organisation continued to expand rapidly, opening its first service for adults – a workshop in Bowen Hills, and its first accommodation service in Toowoomba in 1964.

In 1982, the Association voted to enact a change of name from the Queensland Sub-Normal Children&#x27;s Welfare Association to Endeavour Foundation, reflecting a change in societal attitudes towards people with a disability and the organisation&#x27;s growth.

By 1984, Endeavour Foundation had grown to provide services to more than 3,500 people in 19 non-vocational day services for adults, 25 schools, 12 workshops, 6 farms, 34 adult residential homes, 24 group homes, and 13 clinics across the state. In 1986, the provision of education to children was taken over by the Queensland Department of Education, and Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s focus moved to support for adults.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, Endeavour Foundation continued to grow, despite recognition that the organisation was losing thousands of dollars per week through the provision of services to people without individualised funding packages by the Queensland Government. This resulted in the shedding of major property assets by the organisation, and the movement and closure of some services.

Currently, Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s services are divided among four geographical areas. These areas are: Queensland North (incorporating Far North Queensland down to Bundaberg), Queensland South (Hervey Bay down to Caloundra and out to Stanthorpe), Queensland Metro (from Moreton down to the Gold Coast and west to Gatton, including Brisbane), and New South Wales/Victoria. The organisation is managed by chief executive officer David Swain and senior management, guided by an elected Board of Directors.

Endeavour Foundation has ten Area Committees made up of Endeavour Foundation members. The committees provide feedback on policy and services, build community links and vote on elected members of the Board.

In September 2009, Endeavour Foundation acquired Cumberland Industries in Western Sydney, providing employment for a further 610 people with a disability, making Endeavour Foundation the largest non-government provider of direct disability employment in Australia.

In 2013, Endeavour Foundation opened a $3.8 million fully accredited food packaging facility in the Brisbane suburb of Wacol. This facility currently provides employment, training and support for 221 people with a disability. The same year, Endeavour Foundation acquired Bay Support Services Group in Hervey Bay. When Bay Support Services went into voluntary liquidation, the Queensland Government asked Endeavour Foundation to take over the operations of the group, securing the support of 68 people with a disability and 230 staff positions.

2014 saw the amalgamation of Endeavour Foundation with supported employment service VATMI Group and also the Community Solutions Group of non-government organisations including TORGAS, Acclaim and Skills Plus/Brace. VATMI was the largest employer of people with a disability in Victoria, with four locations and various facilities in Kew, Keon Park, Bendigo, Wangaratta and Stawell. The merge with Community Solutions Group helped form Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s Community Solutions Division; providing valued and complementary health and wellbeing, workforce (including apprenticeships), education and training services.

In 2017, Endeavour Foundation completed construction of the Kingaroy Kitchen Cafe. The addition of a cafe to the already successful commercial kitchen provides even more opportunities for people with a disability to develop skills working in hospitality and customer service.

The Endeavour Foundation of today is a diverse and embracing collection of like-minded businesses and communities from across the country. While much has changed over the last 66 years, the core objective and commitment of the organisation remains unchanged – to provide real possibilities and opportunities for people with a disability.

==Services provided==
In order to bring real possibilities to life, Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s disability services are tailored around an individual&#x27;s goals and aspirations. Endeavour Foundation currently supports more than 4,000 people to live fulfilling lives across 230 locations in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Most service users are adults with Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, Fragile X syndrome and non-specific intellectual disabilities. Endeavour Foundation is the largest non-government provider of direct community services (to any group) in Australia.

===Home &amp; Daily Life===
Endeavour Foundation provides people with disabilities better access to their communities and the chance to experience more in their daily lives through a range of housing and daily support services. With the aim of helping people transition to a more independent lifestyle, support is tailored to individual needs to allow customers to thrive. Living independently assists many people in achieving their goals, learning life skills and engaging in their community. Endeavour Foundation assists people in securing accommodation in either private or shared rented, public or private housing.

===Work===
As Australia&#x27;s largest employer of people with a disability, Endeavour Foundation is experienced in providing supported employment and training focusing on what people can do, their strengths and capabilities. Endeavour Foundation supported workplaces are involved in the manufacture of industrial cleaning cloths, timber furniture and other wood products, mailing, collation and packing services (including food and pharmaceutical packaging), document destruction, e-recycling, industrial sewing, agriculture (nurseries, farms and orchards), as well as QArt – a professionally operated art studio for artists with a disability, with an accompanying retail gallery in Kew, Victoria – and Kingaroy Kitchen Fine Foods and Cafe, which sell a large range of delicious home-style jams, chutneys and biscuits. Endeavour Foundation also operates training organisations and employment agencies that offer specialised transition to work programs, work placements and apprenticeships.

===Learning===
Endeavour Foundation offers a range of learning and development opportunities that enable people with a disability to use their current knowledge and strengths to develop new skills. A tailored learning program can be developed with Endeavour Foundation to assist with a range of needs including: practical living skills to build confidence and self-esteem, learning or career plans depending on the person&#x27;s aspirations, building knowledge or qualifications for meaningful employment and mentors to assist in transitioning through school, work and towards independent living.

===Social &amp; Community Participation===
Endeavour Foundation offers opportunities for people interested in trying new activities, making new friends and increasing their participation in the community. Customers are able to participate in activities that they know they enjoy, or alternatively go outside of their comfort zone and try something new. The organisation has helped countless people with disabilities to join social groups or communal activities, learn how to use public transport or to drive a car, play musical instruments, sing in choirs, and even just attend regular community activities like sporting events or going to the movies. Endeavour Foundation supports people in whatever they would like to do.

===Relationships &amp; Independence===
Endeavour Foundation provides a range of supports to enable people with disabilities to form positive relationships with friends, family and other important people in their lives. Communication skills including assistive technology, behavioural support to manage difficult emotions and behaviours and support groups are all available. All services are designed to allow customers to achieve greater independence, and choice and control over how they live their lives.

==Shops and Products==
Endeavour Foundation runs 26 recycled clothing stores in Queensland and New South Wales, known as &quot;Endo&#x27;s&quot;, as well as an online eBay store. These stores sell new and recycled clothing, furniture, books, bedding and bric-a-brac.

Kingaroy Kitchen Fine Foods, which provides employment and training opportunities for 27 supported employees in the South Burnett region, produces hampers, preservative-free chutneys, marmalades, jams, biscuits and cakes available for purchase. The addition of a cafe in 2017 provides additional employment opportunities as well as the option for customers to dine-in and experience the Kingaroy Kitchen hospitality first-hand.

Endeavour Foundation has partnered with local Queensland councils to manage Tip Shops and Recycle Markets. There are currently ten Endeavour Foundation Tip Shops and Recycle Markets in Queensland that salvage and sell household items and furnishings, collectables, books and toys, and sporting equipment.

All funds raised through Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s shops are reinvested into providing real possibilities for people with a disability. The stores also provide a valuable range of employment opportunities for people with a disability.

==Fundraising==
The Great Endeavour Rally is Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s flagship annual fundraising event, which has been running for more than 30 years.

Endeavour Foundation is also well known for their prize home lotteries, which have been raising funds for the organisation for more than 40 years. Seven prize home lotteries and five Ultimate Life Changer lotteries are run each year.

All funds raised through lotteries and fundraising events go directly towards Endeavour Foundation&#x27;s programs to support people with intellectual disability.

==Criticism and controversy==
Endeavour Foundation has been subject to some criticism for its large size, conservatism, and influence on government policy. Since 2000, the organisation has been shedding property assets and closing some services.

In 2000 and 2001, Endeavour Foundation attracted major controversy when it decided to cut case management services, with some staff discovering their positions had been made redundant through the press. In 2004, Endeavour Foundation was again subject to criticism for its decision to cut the Specialist Services team, an innovative service supporting staff to support service users with challenging (aggressive and assaultive) behaviour, only to announce in October 2005 that it would be reinstating the staff support service in a reduced form (though the employment of Disability Advisors) and combining abuse response and advocacy functions.

<doc id="1306320" wikidata="Q6398440" url="?curid=1306320" title="Keystone (train)">
<text>The Keystone was a set of eight lightweight streamlined cars built by the Budd Company in 1956 for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The set comprised seven coaches seating a total of 574 passengers and a single head end power (HEP) generator car. The train was normally used in New York, New York, to Washington, D.C., service, making two round trips per day. The design was not a success and the cars were retired in 1968.

== Design ==
The coaches were of a unique, split-level design, with the center portion of each car having a floor level two feet below that of standard coaches. This lowered the cars&#x27; center of gravity, allowing the train to safely take curves at higher speeds. The coaches were also built to a stressed-skin &quot;Tubular&quot; design, with the shell of the car providing all of the cars structural strength, without the normal heavy steel underframe. This resulted in cars weighing only 60% of what standard cars would weigh.

The split-level design, with short stairways between levels, proved unpopular with passengers, causing bottlenecks during loading and unloading.

== Service history ==
The Pennsylvania introduced the cars in 1956, with the set making two daily round-trips between New York City and Washington, D.C. These services were named &quot;Morning Keystone&quot;, &quot;Midday Keystone&quot;, &quot;Evening Keystone&quot;, and &quot;Midnight Keystone&quot;. In addition to the tubular coaches all four trains operated with conventional equipment such as dining cars and parlor cars. The &quot;Midnight Keystone&quot;, which departed New York at 11:10 PM, carried sleeping cars.

The train set was retired from service in 1968 and stored in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Amtrak took possession of the equipment but sold it to the South East Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) in May 1976 for $80,000. SEMTA never used the equipment, and sold it to the Chicago, Central and Pacific Railroad in 1986.

<doc id="1306335" wikidata="Q15514914" url="?curid=1306335" title="Jeff Green (writer)">
<text>Jeffrey Green (born October 12, 1961) is an American writer and video game journalist, and the last editor-in-chief of &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine.&quot; In November 2013, Jeff left PopCap Games, where he served as a director of editorial and social media. He was employed by the &quot;Sims&quot; division of developer Electronic Arts, where he served as a designer, producer, and writer. Green kept his job at Ziff Davis after the closing of &quot;GFW&quot; for several months before announcing his departure from the company. While an employee at Ziff Davis, Green hosted the weekly &quot;CGW Radio&quot; podcast (which later became &quot;GFW Radio&quot;) and hosted &quot;The Official EA Podcast&quot;.

==Early career==

Green graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in English. In 1991, he joined Ziff Davis Press, a subsidiary of Ziff Davis Media, which published computer books. Later, he moved to the weekly Macintosh trade journal &quot;MacWEEK&quot; as a review editor.

==&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;==

In 2001, Green was named editor-in-chief of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. By 2004, all original staff at &quot;CGW&quot; when he first joined had left. Green contributed writing to &quot;The Art of Warcraft&quot;, published in 2002 by BradyGames, a book detailing the art and design of the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series of real-time strategy games. Looking back on the job as &quot;essentially a shill job&quot;, Green procrastinated on his writing for Brady so long that the publisher reduced his pay for the work. Green considers the late nineties to be the &quot;peak years&quot; of the &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. Issues were over 300 pages in length, and because the Internet was not as prevalent then, &quot;magazines were all that there were. If gamers wanted gaming news, you read the magazines.&quot;

===&quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;===

In August 2006, Ziff Davis announced that they would be partnering with Microsoft to rebrand &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; as &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;. The move was done in order to market the magazine to a wider audience. At the same time, Green insisted that the publication would remain a &quot;hardcore PC gaming magazine&quot;, and that Microsoft would have no editorial influence on the magazine&#x27;s content. In a June 2007 interview, Green said that gaming magazines were in a &quot;period of transition&quot;, as the increasing prevalence of the Internet meant that print was no longer the primary source of information for enthusiasts. &quot;We&#x27;re all trying to figure out what that means, then—how to stay relevant, vital or even necessary at all.&quot; Green believes the rise of the &quot;Digital Age&quot; has forced print outlets to rethink how they produce content. The &quot;GFW&quot; staff considered how to write for an audience that regularly visits gaming websites, and how to write articles that are &quot;better, different or deeper than what everyone has already done online, weeks before us&quot;.

===Magazine closure===

In April 2008, Ziff Davis announced that &quot;Games for Windows&quot; would be closing down. The magazine&#x27;s seventeenth issue, the April/May 2008 issue featuring &quot;The Sims 3&quot; on the cover, was its last. While the magazine&#x27;s art team, Michael Jennings and Rosemary Pinkham, were laid off, the editorial staff, which included Green, as well as Shawn Elliott, Sean Molloy, and Ryan Scott, were kept as editors of 1UP.com. Specifically, the staff aimed to improve 1UP&#x27;s coverage of PC games. &quot;Games for Windows&quot; relaunched in May 2008 as the &quot;PC door&quot; of 1UP.com, a section of the site dedicated to the coverage of computer games. It also served as an area to archive columns from &quot;CGW&quot; and &quot;GFW&quot;, such as &quot;Greenspeak&quot; and &quot;Tom vs. Bruce&quot;. Green became editor-in-chief of this part of the website. However, as time passed, Green found that he was less interested in contributing to the website than he was in the magazine.

&quot;The Web job itself—my regular job—in the post-magazine world turned out to be something of a mixed bag for me. While I saw Shawn and Ryan every day at the office and on the podcast, they were spun off into different directions when GFW closed, and so that close, a creative bond that Sean, Shawn, Ryan, and I had formed to make the magazine did not persist unfettered on the Web. We were not an &quot;online version of the magazine.&quot; We were four guys absorbed into the greater good of the website...What became increasingly clear to me over the last few months...is that the concerns of a website, the concerns of this website, are not really my concerns at this point in my life.&quot;

Green announced in September 2008, that he would be leaving Ziff Davis and 1UP.com to pursue a career in game development at Electronic Arts. Specifically, Green would be working in the &quot;Sims&quot; department of EA, under the direction of designer Rod Humble. The two met when Humble was a guest on &quot;GFW Radio&quot;, and when considering where to work and who to work with, Humble was &quot;at the top of my list&quot;. Green described him as being &quot;a totally brilliant, smart, funny guy, and those are the kinds of people we like to be around.&quot;

==Electronic Arts==

September 22, 2008 was Green&#x27;s first official day as an employee of Electronic Arts. Green began contributing to an unannounced project, but within a month was transferred to another project. &quot;I am seeing some of the volatility of the game biz.&quot; In November 2008, Green said he was helping to research future games in the &quot;SimAnimals&quot; line. Within six months of his employment at EA, Green had been moved to a new project three times. Green wrote dialogue and other text for &quot;SimAnimals&quot; and &quot;MySims Agents&quot; and helped promote &quot;MySims Agents&quot; at the 2009 Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.

Green has said that the transition from writing about games to making games was difficult, but that the work is &quot;incredibly rewarding…simply for the fact that it is challenging me&quot;. The collaborative process of developing a game is what he has found most fascinating. &quot;It becomes clearer and clearer to me just how complicated the business of making a game is, and the near miracle it is to get all the people involved aligned and understanding of what it is you&#x27;re trying to do.&quot;

===EA.com===

On October 23, 2009, Green announced via Twitter that he had been named editor-in-chief of EA.com. Green further explained his new position at the company on his blog, saying that he would be producing new editorial content for Electronic Arts. At the same time, he wrote that this would not be a return to the games journalism field for him: &quot;Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. I&#x27;m the EIC of a corporate website whose primary goal is to sell games.&quot; Jeff wrote on Twitter that his new role at the company would be &quot;not quite PR, and not quite editorial. Some kind of odd hybrid.&quot;

===EA departure===
On August 14, 2010, Jeff Green updated his blog with the following:

I&#x27;ve left EA. The details of the hows and whys and wherefores are mostly better left unsaid, for all sorts of reasons. But to get the one thing out of the way that everyone wants to know—did he quit or was he fired—the answer is: Kind of neither. The folks who run the website wanted to change directions. That direction didn&#x27;t include the creation of original content. So my job description was changed. And since what I do best (well, other than play games, eat pizza, and lay on the couch and do nothing) is create content, it clearly was no longer the best fit for me. So I&#x27;m out.

==Podcasting==

Green has hosted and appeared on a number of podcasts. The first episode of &quot;CGW Radio&quot; was released on February 16, 2006, hosted by Green, and featured a cast of editors from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s staff, made to produce a show along with other Ziff Davis publications, including &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot;, initially approached the idea with apprehension. &quot;The podcast started out as something alien and unwanted to us, but then quickly morphed into something we loved, as we realized the opportunities it gave us to entertain folks and connect with our audience in an entirely different, and much more immediate way.&quot; &quot;CGW Radio&quot; was renamed to &quot;GFW Radio&quot; with the rebranding of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; as &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;. &quot;GFW Radio&quot; developed a &quot;fiercely dedicated listener base&quot; over the years. The show&#x27;s last episode came after Green&#x27;s departure from Ziff Davis, as well as that of &quot;GFW&quot; editor Shawn Elliott.

At Electronic Arts, Green approached his employers with the prospect of creating an EA-centric podcast. Green believed hosting a podcast would allow him to utilize past talents developed at Ziff Davis while hosting &quot;CGW Radio&quot; and &quot;GFW Radio&quot;. On his blog, Green wrote that while such a podcast would promote Electronic Arts products, he would strive to create a well-produced show. &quot;So, while, yes, from the perspective of my employers the goal, of course, is to &quot;sell&quot; EA, for me, the goal is to actually have a good show that I can be proud of and that you will want to listen to.&quot; The first episode of the EA podcast was released on June 19, 2009. Green is also a regular on &quot;Out of the Game&quot;, a podcast featuring current and former game journalists, including Green, Shawn Elliott, Robert Ashley, N&#x27;Gai Croal, and Luke Smith.

Jeff Green has appeared as a special guest on Giant Bomb&#x27;s Giant Bombcast (on Aug 17, 2010, Dec 14, 2010, and Nov 12, 2013) and on Episode 87 of RebelFM.

==Personal life==

Green lives in Berkeley, California with his wife and daughter, and has written game reviews for &quot;Games for Windows&quot; in the past. Green is in the process of writing his first novel, &quot;The Cudgel of Xanthor.&quot; The book is based on a column he once wrote which was a parody of video game previews. In the book, a video game development company is working on the third installment of the Xanthor series of games – the first two being the Blade of Xanthor, and the Sword of Xanthor. Green has stated in podcasts that his inspiration for the book derived from his two years working for Electronic Arts where he saw, first-hand, how games are developed. The book cuts back and forth between the company and Xanthor himself, living in the world the developers are creating. Xanthor must deal in his own world with the myriad and arbitrary changes the developers make. Jeff stated in a recent interview that he ceased working on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Real Talk w/ Jeff Green&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="1306336" wikidata="Q5386007" url="?curid=1306336" title="Eric Allen">
<text>Eric Andre Allen (born November 22, 1965) is an American former professional football cornerback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints, and Oakland Raiders from 1988 to 2001. A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Allen retired after the 2001 season and is currently an NFL analyst for Pac-12 Networks. In his NFL career, he recorded 54 interceptions for 826 yards and eight touchdowns, while also recovering seven fumbles. His 54 interceptions is tied for 21st in NFL history. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2025.

In 2019, he served as the defensive backs coach for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football (AAF).

==Early life==
Allen played high school football at Point Loma High School under legendary coach Bennie Edens.

==College career==
Allen played college football at Arizona State University.

==Professional career==
Allen was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 1988 NFL draft.

Allen played seven seasons for the Eagles, three seasons for the New Orleans Saints, and four seasons for the Oakland Raiders. While with the Eagles he was a very popular player with the &quot;Gang Green&quot; Defense, playing with NFL greats Reggie White, Seth Joyner, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Andre Waters, Byron Evans, Mike Pitts, and Wes Hopkins. He is the only NFL player to run back three or more interceptions for scores in two separate seasons.

One of Allen&#x27;s most memorable plays occurred October 3, 1993, in a game against the New York Jets. Having lost their starting quarterback (Randall Cunningham) to a fractured fibula early in the contest, the Eagles found themselves trailing the Jets by two points late in the 4th quarter as the Jets drove downfield for what would likely be the game&#x27;s final points. Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason attempted to throw for a first down inside the Eagles 10-yard line as Allen stepped in front of the intended receiver at the 6-yard line. The ensuing 94-yard touchdown return was declared &quot;Greatest Interception Return in NFL History&quot; by Steve Sabol of NFL Films.

After several successful and injury-free seasons at Philadelphia and New Orleans, Allen blew out his knee during the 1998 season on November 15 while playing for the Oakland Raiders against the Seattle Seahawks and missed the rest of that season. But he came back strong in 2000 and had a season to remember, with six interceptions, including a team-record three for touchdowns. His teammates honored him with the first annual Eric Turner award for the Raiders&#x27; most outstanding defensive player. The award was created in the memory of the Oakland free safety who died of abdominal cancer in May 2000.

Through the 2001 season, Allen played in 216 of a possible 224 games.

In 2009, Allen also was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

==NFL career statistics==


==Television career==
Allen joined ESPN in August 2002 as an NFL studio analyst. Allen primarily appears on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sportscenter&quot; as an NFL analyst.

Allen has had appearances as a college football analyst on the Pac-12 Networks football shows, as well as for the station&#x27;s flagship show &quot;Sports Report&quot; as a football analyst.

==Coaching career==
On December 19, 2018, Allen was named defensive backs coach for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football.

==Personal life==
He now lives in San Diego, California with his wife Lynn Allen, with whom he has four children.

<text>Mellivora is a genus of mustelids that contains the honey badger or ratel &quot;(Mellivora capensis)&quot;. It is also the sole living representative of the subfamily Mellivorinae. Additionally, two extinct species are known. The honey badger is native to much of Africa and South Asia, while fossil relatives occurred in those areas and Southern Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Mellivora&quot; probably evolved from the more primitive &quot;Promellivora punjabiensis&quot; of India (which itself was formerly classified as &quot;M. punjabiensis&quot;). The two genera are grouped together in the tribe Eomellivorini together with the extinct giant mustelids &quot;Eomellivora&quot; and &quot;Ekorus&quot;.
&quot;Mellivora benfieldi&quot; is considered a likely ancestor of the living honey badger.

<text>Batcombe is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated in the steep valley of the River Alham south-east of Shepton Mallet and south of Bristol. The parish has a population of 439. Batcombe village is at the heart of the parish, which also includes the hamlets of Westcombe, Spargrove and Eastcombe (historically Ashcombe).

==History==

The name Batcombe comes from Saxon and means &quot;Bat&#x27;s Valley&quot;.

Around from Batcombe village is an Iron Age hill fort on Smalldown Knoll which dates back to the Iron Age and possibly the Bronze Age.

Batcombe is thought to have been established around 660 CE following the Saxon invasion of Great Britain. Both settlements are recorded in the Domesday Book written after the Norman invasion of England in 1066. The parish of Batcombe was part of the Whitstone Hundred.

The Mendip district was, for several centuries, highly dependent on the wool industry, with which these villages were linked.

Westcombe was for many years property of Glastonbury Abbey which was destroyed with the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The hamlet and area as a whole had strong links with the English woolen industry, which gave name to settlements such as Milton Clevedon.

For a long time the Bisse family owned much property in Batcombe, as well as other local villages, including Spargrove.

The Church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the 15th and 16th centuries and was restored in the 19th. The tower contains five bells dating from 1760 and made by Thomas Bilbie, of the Bilbie family, in Cullompton. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

In the 1643 the people of Batcombe got into a fight with the people of Bruton. 

Batcombe has a war memorial dedicated to those who gave their lives in World War I. The war memorial in Westcombe has engraved on it around 12 names. It was originally a family memorial to Henry Ernst in 1913, but it was later converted to a war memorial in 1919.

In 1933 Batcombe village hall was built next to the village school. The hall was constructed largely of timber and built by local villagers. By the 1990s the hall&#x27;s age was beginning to show, and it was clearly rotting. In 2001 the hall was demolished, mainly by local people. Once the site had been cleared (most of the wood being recycled) the foundations were laid for the new hall. The &quot;Batcombe Jubilee Hall&quot; was completed in May 2002, and officially opened by HRH Prince Charles on 25 May 2002. The Jubilee Hall is mainly of stone construction, with two sides made of external timber. In all the project cost over £500,000. The hall is run by the Batcombe Village Hall Trust, a charitable organisation of volunteers.

The property in Westcombe was historically owned by a single family, the Ernst family who lived in the Georgian country house of Westcombe House. Most of the estate was sold in 1927, and divided between two daughters. One inherited Westcombe House and the other all the family&#x27;s wealth. The house fell into disrepair, and was demolished in the early 1950s. Today the hamlet is home to a small industrial site owned mainly by Milton-Westcombe Farms Limited. The largest business operation on site is that of the Bay Tree Food Company, which produces handmade pickled and jam goods sold across the UK.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It is also part of the Frome and East Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

Before Brexit it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Notable people==
*Henry Albin (1624–1696) – minister. 
*Richard Alleine (1610–1681) – Puritan minister.
*Richard Bernard (1568–1641) – Puritan minister.
*Philip Bisse (1540–1613) – Puritan Minister, Archdeacon of Taunton, gave nearly 3000 books to found the library at Wadham College, Oxford.

<text>Todd Marvin Marinovich (born Marvin Scott Marinovich; July 4, 1969) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) (Los Angeles Raiders), Canadian Football League (CFL) (Winnipeg Blue Bombers, BC Lions), and Arena Football League (AFL) (Los Angeles Avengers). He played college football for the USC Trojans. Marinovich is known for the well-documented, intense focus of his training as a young athlete and his brief career as a professional, cut short primarily because of his addiction to drugs.

==Early development==
Marinovich grew up on the Balboa Peninsula of Newport Beach, California. His father, Marv Marinovich, had been a lineman and a captain for the USC Trojans during the 1962 national championship season and played in the 1963 Rose Bowl. Marinovich&#x27;s mother, Trudi (née Fertig), was a high school swimmer who dropped out of USC to marry Marv. Her brother Craig was a star USC quarterback at this time.

After harming his own National Football League lineman career by overtraining and focusing too much on weight and bulk, Marv studied Eastern Bloc training methods and was hired by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis as the NFL&#x27;s first strength-and-conditioning coach. Marv later opened his own athletic research center and applied the techniques to his young son, introducing athletic training before Marinovich could leave the crib and continuing it throughout his childhood and adolescence.

Marv saw an opportunity to use techniques, focusing on speed and flexibility, that later formed the basis for modern core training. During her pregnancy, Trudi used no salt, sugar, alcohol, or tobacco; as a baby, Todd was fed only fresh vegetables, fruits, and raw milk. Marv Marinovich commented, &quot;Some guys think the most important thing in life is their jobs, the stock market, whatever. To me, it was my kids. The question I asked myself was, How well could a kid develop if you provided him with the perfect environment?&quot;

==High school career==
Marinovich had a very successful high school career, becoming the first freshman to start a varsity high school football game in Orange County. He began his career at Mater Dei High School, a large Catholic high school in Santa Ana, alma mater of quarterbacks such as Matt Barkley, and Heisman Trophy winners Matt Leinart, John Huarte, and Bryce Young. Despite throwing for nearly 4,400 yards and 34 touchdowns in his two years at Mater Dei, Marinovich transferred to Mission Viejo&#x27;s Capistrano Valley High School due to his parents&#x27; divorce. Once there, Marinovich broke the all-time Orange County passing record and later the national high school record by passing for 9,914 yards, including 2,477 his senior year. He received numerous honors, including being named a &quot;Parade&quot; All-American, the National High School Coaches Association&#x27;s offensive player of the year, the Dial Award for the national high school scholar-athlete of the year in 1987, and the Touchdown Club&#x27;s national high school player of the year.

===National attention===
Marinovich&#x27;s unique development led to growing media attention. In January 1988, he appeared on the cover of &quot;California&quot; magazine with the headline &quot;.&quot; The popular media applied the Robo Quarterback label to Marinovich for years afterwards, even after his training and life became much less regimented. In February &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published an article, titled &quot;Bred To Be A Superstar&quot;, that discussed his unique upbringing under his father who wanted to turn his son into the &quot;perfect quarterback&quot;. The article declared Marinovich &quot;America&#x27;s first test-tube athlete&quot;, and discussed how his mother encouraged his interest in art, music, and classical Hollywood cinema while banning cartoons as too violent. His father assembled a team of advisers to tutor him on every facet of the game. The article stated that:
Long after Marinovich&#x27;s professional career had ended, an ESPN columnist named the elder Marinovich one of history&#x27;s &quot;worst sports fathers&quot;. Regardless, the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article was incorrect about his son&#x27;s self-control. During high school, he started drinking in after-game parties and smoked marijuana daily. His use of marijuana grew to the point that he would meet with a group of friends—athletes, skaters, surfers, and musicians—every day before school to share a bong before classes in what they nicknamed &quot;Zero Period&quot;. Having previously dealt with social anxiety, Marinovich found marijuana relaxed him and did not affect him later during sporting events. The rumors of his use spread to opposing fans, however, who taunted him with chants of &quot;&quot;Marijuana&quot;-vich&quot; during basketball. His parents divorced around the time he transferred high schools, and he lived in a small apartment with his father for his final two high school seasons. Marinovich enjoyed the period, noting: &quot;Probably the best part of my childhood was me and Marv&#x27;s relationship my junior and senior years. After the divorce, he really loosened up. It was a bachelor pad. We were both dating.&quot;

Almost every major college program recruited Marinovich who, as a high school freshman, began getting letters from Stanford. Despite the family connections to USC he was uncertain whether he fit the program&#x27;s offense. After a positive visit, however, Marinovich chose the university over recent national champions BYU and Miami, as well as Arizona State, Stanford, and Washington. Marinovich took his college selection seriously, noting: &quot;This is the biggest decision of my life. It means not only where I will play football, but most likely, who I will marry, who my best friends for life will be, and where I will live. It means everything. And the one thing I know for sure is I&#x27;m too young to make this kind of decision by myself.&quot;

==College career==

Marinovich entered USC as a Fine Arts major and redshirted the 1988 season behind Rodney Peete. Already under intense pressure as a high school prospect, the combination of high expectation and the many new temptations that were prohibited under his strict upbringing soon overwhelmed him. He was torn between embracing the freedom and following his father&#x27;s teachings, noting that &quot;I&#x27;m finally away from my dad telling me everything to do. And I&#x27;ve got to say I have taken advantage of it. Full advantage. He keeps telling me, &#x27;Come on, you&#x27;ve got the rest of your life to fool around. Not now.&#x27; I know he&#x27;s right. But there are a lot of distractions at SC.&quot; At one point Marinovich left school in his freshman year to see his mother, stating &quot;I wish I could go somewhere else and be someone else. I don&#x27;t want to be Todd Marinovich.&quot;

Outside of his personal travails, Marinovich&#x27;s football career for USC had an abrupt start. As a redshirt freshman in 1989, he was backup to Pat O&#x27;Hara after an unimpressive spring practice; in the fall preseason, however, O&#x27;Hara suffered a serious leg injury. Although neither his coaches nor teammates believed that he was ready, Marinovich became the first freshman quarterback to start the first game of the season for USC since World War II. After an upset loss to Illinois in part due to a coaching decision to minimize his role, Marinovich improved; he completed 197 of 321 passes during the regular season for 16 touchdowns and 12 interceptions with a 61.4% completion percentage, 0.1% behind Bernie Kosar&#x27;s NCAA freshman record. Against Washington State, Marinovich led a last-minute comeback that became known as &quot;The Drive&quot;. He led the offense on a 91-yard march downfield with 11 crucial completions, including a touchdown pass and a two-point conversion, that prompted former President Ronald Reagan to call Marinovich to invite him to his home in Los Angeles. The Trojans went 9–2–1, won the Pac-10 Conference, and defeated Michigan in the 1990 Rose Bowl. UPI and &quot;Sporting News&quot; named Marinovich the College Freshman of the Year for 1989; he was the only freshman on the All-Pac-10 team and the first freshman quarterback named.

Marinovich entered the 1990 season as a Heisman Trophy candidate, with speculation on his leaving school early for the NFL. Head coach Larry Smith set for Marinovich the goal of a 70% pass completion rate. However, his play became erratic due to his personal difficulties. After finding out Marinovich had been skipping numerous classes, Smith suspended him from the Arizona State game, but his play against Arizona had been so poor that he might have been kept out of the game regardless. Smith had a difficult relationship with Marinovich, and the relationship worsened when the quarterback began yelling at the coach on national television during a loss in the 1990 John Hancock Bowl. Marinovich was arrested for cocaine possession a month later, and entered the NFL draft after the season.

==Professional career==

===NFL===
At the 1991 NFL draft the Raiders selected Marinovich in the first round; he was the 24th pick overall and the second quarterback taken—ahead of Brett Favre—signing a three-year, $2.25 million deal. Marinovich made his NFL debut on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, in an exhibition game against the Dallas Cowboys on August 12, 1991. Entering the game with 15 minutes remaining, he moved the Raiders downfield, completing three of four passes for 16 yards and a touchdown. He did not start a game until Jay Schroeder was injured before the final week of the season, where he impressed observers with 23 completions in 40 passes for 243 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs in a close loss. Because of this great debut he started the following week against the Chiefs in the playoffs, but was very poor, throwing for just 140 yards with four interceptions in a 10–6 loss and smashing a locker room mirror with his helmet after the game.

After the Raiders began 0–2 in 1992 with Schroeder as quarterback, Marinovich became the starter. He threw for 395 yards in a loss in his first start that season and lost the following week as the Raiders started 0–4. He then won three of his next four games before losing to the Dallas Cowboys. Marinovich&#x27;s best game during that span was against the Buffalo Bills on October 11, 1992, in which he completed 11 of 21 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns in a 20–3 victory. The following week Marinovich started against the Philadelphia Eagles, seeing three of his first 10 passes intercepted. Schroeder regained the starting job and Marinovich never played again in the NFL.

Marinovich had serious substance abuse issues throughout his NFL career. During his rookie season, he increased his partying and drug use beyond marijuana, including taking pharmaceutical amphetamines before games. Because of his college arrest for cocaine possession, the NFL required him to submit to frequent drug tests. Marinovich passed the tests using friends&#x27; urine, but after using the urine of a teammate who had been drinking heavily, the test registered a blood alcohol content four times the legal limit and caused the Raiders to force him into rehabilitation. The Raiders held an intervention for him after the season, and Marinovich spent 45 days at a rehab facility. In the 1992 season Marinovich shifted to using LSD after games, because it would not show up on the drug test. His play suffered and his coaches complained he was not grasping the complex offense. He failed his second NFL drug test and went back into rehabilitation. In training camp before the 1993 season, Marinovich failed his third NFL drug test, this time for marijuana, and was suspended for the 1993 season. The Raiders released Marinovich on the final cutdown, choosing not to pay for Marinovich&#x27;s salary while being suspended in the year before the salary cap would go into effect.

In 1994, once Marinovich&#x27;s suspension was lifted, the Pittsburgh Steelers showed some interest in signing him to be their third-string quarterback behind Neil O&#x27;Donnell and Mike Tomczak. Marinovich, not liking the culture of the NFL, chose not to return to the league. The Steelers ended up turning to the NFL draft instead, drafting Jim Miller.

===Post-NFL===
After traveling for two years Marinovich attempted to join the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League, but suffered a serious knee injury on the first day of training camp. During recovery, one of his high school friends introduced him to heroin. Soon after, Marinovich was arrested for drug possession and served three months in various jails.

In April 1999, Marinovich was cleared to reenter the NFL but suffered a herniated disk playing recreational basketball. That summer he tried out and received interest from the San Diego Chargers and the Chicago Bears, but failed the physical examination so he signed as a backup quarterback with the BC Lions of the CFL. His use of heroin and cocaine increased and his weight dropped, as he would spend almost all of his free time using drugs. At one point Marinovich severely cut his hand with a crack pipe during halftime and had to covertly bandage himself. Despite being asked to stay with the team for another season, he realized he was in a bad situation and left the team.

Marinovich returned to Los Angeles in 2000 and joined the expansion Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League. Despite undergoing severe heroin withdrawal he had a strong season, tying the record for most touchdowns in a single game by throwing 10 touchdowns against the Houston Thunderbears. Marinovich was named to the all-rookie team, and as the Avengers&#x27; franchise player, but the day he received his signing bonus he was arrested for buying heroin. Marinovich&#x27;s career continued to fall apart, as he was ejected from subsequent games for throwing things at referees, and eventually was suspended from the team in 2001.

Despite flashes of brilliance, Marinovich&#x27;s professional career is widely considered to be a bust. In 2004 Marinovich was included in ESPN.com&#x27;s list of The 25 Biggest Sports Flops, coming in at fourth on the ESPN.com editors&#x27; list, and seventh on the readers&#x27; list.

====SoCal Coyotes ====
In 2017, Marinovich agreed to continue his rehabilitation under AAA Hall of Fame head coach J. David Miller of the six-time champion and Palm Springs-based SoCal Coyotes of Development Football International (DFI). After a successful spring coaching the Coyotes&#x27; quarterbacks and volunteering with local youth throughout the Coachella Valley, Marinovich made his case to play for the team in a quest to become the oldest starting quarterback in pro football. In a press conference, Miller agreed to stand by his aging player&#x27;s commitment to sobriety, and signed Marinovich on July 3, 2017. As the signing was primarily to help the quarterback rehabilitate, Miller noted Marinovich&#x27;s comeback had &quot;very little to do with football.&quot;

To learn the intricacies of Miller&#x27;s run and shoot offense, Marinovich attended mandatory meetings and workouts with the offense&#x27;s creator Mouse Davis. In Palm Springs, he was tutored by Michael Karls, a record-setting quarterback at Midland University and the Coyotes&#x27; second all-time leading passer who agreed to sit in favor of Marinovich despite the age gap. Marinovich also battled with 25-year-old Jacob Russell for the starting job, which the elder quarterback won.

On September 3, 2017, wearing his traditional number 12 that had adorned for the Raiders, a sober 48-year-old Marinovich stepped back into pro football after a 17-year lay-off. He completed 19 for 28 passes for 262 yards, seven touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Coyotes won 73–0 against the California Sharks. In a post-game interview, he noted it was his first game while sober since he was 15 years old. However, eventual shoulder pain led to his immediate withdrawal from action by team physicians. He never played again.

==After football==
By 2004, Marinovich was unemployed and again living on the Balboa Peninsula; when he was arrested in 2004 for skateboarding in a prohibited area, police found methamphetamines and syringes on him. In May 2005, he was charged with violating probation, but avoided jail by entering an inpatient treatment program. For the next year, Marinovich was in and out of rehab facilities. He was again arrested on August 26, 2007, for possession of drugs and resisting arrest. He was offered a suspended sentence in exchange for regular drug testing, therapy, and meetings with a probation officer. Marinovich began working several part-time jobs, including scraping barnacles off of boats, leading weekly group meetings at a rehab center, painting murals in residential homes, and as a private quarterback coach.

Marinovich still follows USC football and occasionally attends open practices at USC. in Orange County and has an online art gallery, featuring original works of impressionist-style paintings, drawings and sculptures, many with sports-related themes.

ESPN released a documentary film about Marinovich titled &quot;The Marinovich Project&quot;, which was shown after the Heisman presentation for 2011.

In 2019, Marinovich served as the quarterbacks coach for the San Diego Strike Force of the Indoor Football League.

==Legal troubles==
Marinovich has had a number of arrests, many of which have been related to his ongoing drug problems, including nine arrests in Orange County, California, alone. He was arrested in 1991, while still a student at USC, on cocaine possession. In 1997, Marinovich was arrested on suspicion of growing marijuana; he served two months in jail, and a third at a minimum-security facility in Orange County known as the Farm. In April 2000, he was arrested for sexual assault, followed by a 2001 arrest on suspicion of heroin.

In August 2004, he was arrested by Newport Beach police for skateboarding in a prohibited zone. Marinovich was arrested in a public bathroom in Newport Beach, California, in May 2005 after being found with apparent drug paraphernalia; he gave his occupation as &quot;unemployed artist&quot; and &quot;anarchist&quot;. Marinovich was ordered to undergo six months of drug rehabilitation followed by six months of outpatient treatment as a result.

In August 2007, Marinovich was arrested and charged with felony drug possession and resisting a police order after being stopped for skateboarding near the Newport Pier boardwalk. On October 30, 2007, he pleaded guilty to felony possession of a small amount of methamphetamine and misdemeanor syringe possession and resisting arrest. Orange County Superior Court Commissioner James Odriozola decided to give Marinovich another chance at rehabilitation and released him to a rehab program in Laguna Beach.

During a period of sobriety from 2007 to 2008, Marinovich worked with National Drug &amp; Alcohol Treatment Centers, located in Newport Beach, California, to help young athletes overcome addiction and to stay clean. In August 2008 after one year of sobriety, Marinovich was hired as a lecturer by Newport Coast Recovery, a drug and alcohol treatment facility in Newport Beach.

On April 4, 2009, he was arrested in Newport Beach after he failed to appear in court for a progress review on his rehabilitation related to his 2007 arrest. He was ordered to be held in jail without bail until his May 4 hearing before the Orange County Superior Court.

On August 22, 2016, he was arrested in Irvine, California after being found naked and in possession of drugs in a neighbor&#x27;s backyard. Authorities say a naked Marinovich tried to open the sliding glass door of an Irvine home. He was cited for trespassing, possession of a controlled substance (later concluded as methamphetamine), possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana. Marinovich was sentenced to 90 days in jail, but could avoid jail time if he had a successful rehab and stayed out of any legal trouble for 36 months.

==Family==
Marinovich was married to Alexandria &quot;Alix&quot; Bambas and they have a son, Baron, and a daughter, Coski. Marinovich met his now ex-wife while the two were in rehab together and first asked her out on a date while they were in rehab. Marinovich has since been romantically linked to Ali Smith, the daughter of former USC coach Larry Smith.

Marinovich has a younger half-brother, Mikhail Marinovich, who played college football as a defensive end at Syracuse University from 2008 to 2011.

Todd&#x27;s father, Marv Marinovich, died at the age of 81 in December 2020.

<doc id="1306351" wikidata="Q449850" url="?curid=1306351" title="Jason Acuña">
<text>Jason Shannon Acuña (born May 16, 1973), better known by his stage name Wee Man, is an American stunt performer, television personality, professional skateboarder, and actor. He is one of the stars of the reality comedy series &quot;Jackass&quot; and the host of Fox Sports Net&#x27;s skateboarding show &quot;54321&quot;. Acuña has achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism.

==Life and career==

Born in Pisa, Italy, Acuña grew up in Torrance, California, and attended North High School. He is of Mexican and German descent. He was the subscription manager for the skateboard magazine &quot;Big Brother&quot;. His association with that magazine led him to become involved with the &quot;Jackass&quot; television series in 2000. 

Acuña&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot; antics include skating as an Oompa-Loompa, kicking himself in the head, dressing as a king while rolling Johnny Knoxville down a staircase in a red carpet, and doing deep-knee bends while holding basketball star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal on his back. A recurring gag involves Preston Lacy asking someone to help him with his bags, only to have Acuña pop out, causing Lacy to chase him.

In 2007, Acuña starred in the reality TV series &quot;Armed and Famous&quot;, and in July 2007, Acuña appeared on TV as a host of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Scarred&quot;.

Acuña appeared on the first season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Circus&quot;. In the fourth week of competition, he became the first contestant to receive a perfect score (a 10-point average). Acuña ended the season in third place.

Acuña is an investor in the Chronic Tacos chain of fast casual Mexican restaurants. His first franchise location opened in 2010 in Redondo Beach, California. After a few years of trying to make this location a success, Acuña closed the location permanently, and in February 2018, he opened a Chronic Tacos franchise in Long Beach, California.

In 2012, Acuña starred in the direct-to-video holiday film &quot;Elf-Man&quot; as the title character. This was his first role in a family-friendly feature film.

<doc id="1306355" wikidata="Q5313047" url="?curid=1306355" title="Duke of Lancaster's Regiment">
<text>The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s, Lancashire and Border) (LANCS) is an infantry regiment of the line within the British Army, part of the King&#x27;s Division. Headquartered in Preston, it recruits throughout the North West of England. The title of Duke of Lancaster merged with the Crown on the accession of Henry V in 1413 and remains dormant, subject to any future revival. Customarily, however, the Sovereign (whether male or female) is referred to as the Duke of Lancaster within Lancashire and in relation to the Duchy of Lancaster, and is the regiment&#x27;s Colonel in Chief. The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment is the county regiment for Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the Isle of Man, and as such, recruits mainly from these areas.

==History==
The regiment&#x27;s formation was announced on 16 December 2004 by Geoff Hoon and General Sir Mike Jackson as part of the restructuring of the infantry, when it was initially to be known as the King&#x27;s Lancashire and Border Regiment. The regiment was given its new name in November 2005. Initially formed of three regular army battalions, it was eventually reduced to two regular battalions, plus an Army Reserve battalion. The regiment was formed through the merger of three single battalion regiments:
*The King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment
*The King&#x27;s Regiment
*The Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment

The regiment was formed on 1 July 2006. Initially, on formation, the regiment contained three regular battalions, with each battalion simply being renamed:
*1st Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment – 1st Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment
*1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Regiment – 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment
*1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment – 3rd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment
In March 2007, the 3rd Battalion was disbanded, with its personnel dispersed to the other two, leaving the final roll of two regular battalions and one Reserve battalion.

In 2012, a Kenyan mother and alleged prostitute called Agnes Wanjiru was allegedly murdered by soldiers of the Duke of Lancaster Regiment, with the murder reportedly covered up by British Army officials. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; said a fellow soldier had gone to the “proper people” immediately after hearing a squaddie confess to the killing, but said he was told to “shut up” when he reported it and no action was taken. Ms Wanjiru&#x27;s body was not discovered until two months later, after the regiment had returned to the UK. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace denied that the British military had covered-up Wanjiru&#x27;s murder, but admitted guilt to and expressed concern over the Army hierarchy turning a &quot;blind eye&quot; to the use of prostitutes by personnel, especially within “countries in poverty”. In 2021, screenshots of a private Facebook group chat allegedly run by soldiers of the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment were published across British newspapers. The screenshots reportedly showed the regiment&#x27;s soldiers joking and laughing at memes mocking the murder of Agnes Wanjiru. The leaking of the secret chats apparently mocking the murder sparked a reinvestigation into the case by Kenyan police. In 2022, UK armed forces introduced a ban on the use of sex workers abroad for the first time. Personnel found to have engaged in what the Ministry of Defence describes as “transactional sex” face the prospect of dismissal – and they could also be prosecuted if in countries where prostitution is illegal.

In December 2021, the regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion re-subordinated to the Ranger Regiment, as its 3rd Battalion.

In 2021 a colour sergeant from 4th Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment was fined and dismissed for lifting the skirt of a Kenyan woman, whom he knew, in a shopping mall in Nanyuki while intoxicated.

A British Army spokesperson described the colour sergeant&#x27;s conduct as disgraceful and said;“This was appalling behaviour from the senior non-commissioned officer.” 

=== Deployments ===
The regiment&#x27;s 4th (Territorial) Battalion has served in Iraq, Cyprus and Afghanistan.

In recent years, deployments have included Denmark, Italy, Nigeria, South Sudan, Kenya, Lithuania, the Baltics, Poland, the Balkans and Georgia.

=== Sports ===
In May 2023, 4LANCS won the 2022-2023 Army Football Reserve Challenge Cup against 6SCOTS in a 2–1 victory at Aldershot. LANCS’ captain Cpl Kiel Brennan was awarded the Player of the Match.

Also in May, personnel from 1 LANCS took part in the IRONMAN70.3 Venice-Jesolo Triathlon. All 5 Triathletes from the 1 LANCS Triathlon club completed the 1.9 km Swim, 90 km Bike &amp; 21 km Run course.

==Regimental structure==
The regiment is split into a 1st and 4th Battalion, with the Regimental Headquarters located in Fulwood Barracks, Preston. The 1st Battalion is a light role infantry battalion based in Chester. The 4th Battalion is the regiment&#x27;s reserve battalion and has its headquarters in Preston, with sub-units dispersed throughout its recruiting areas of Merseyside, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Cumbria. Both battalions form part of the new 4th Light Brigade Combat Team, in the 1st (UK) Division.

==Regimental museum==
There are five regimental museum collections based around the antecedent regiments:
*The King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment Museum is based within Lancaster City Museum.
*The King&#x27;s Regiment collection is housed in the Museum of Liverpool.

*The Lancashire Infantry Museum is based at Fulwood Barracks in Preston.

==Battle honours==

Infantry regiments are permitted to display 43 battle honours from the two world wars on the Queen&#x27;s Colour and 46 honours from other conflicts on the Regimental Colour. Upon amalgamation, the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment had to choose from the total list of honours of its three antecedents which honours would be displayed on its new Colours.

In addition to the displayed honours, the Regimental Colour will also display four emblems from the antecedents regiments:

*Lion of England – displayed top left; from the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment
*White Horse of Hanover – displayed top right; from the King&#x27;s Regiment
*Red Rose charged with the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers – displayed bottom left; from the Lancashire Regiment (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers)
*Red Rose charged with the Royal Crest – displayed bottom right; from the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)

In addition, the Regimental Colour also features a Sphinx to distinguish the battle honour &quot;Egypt&quot; and a Dragon for the honour &quot;China&quot;.

==Golden threads==
The regiment has brought forward a number of &quot;Golden Threads&quot; from its antecedents, as displays of its history and heritage:
*Lion of England – the English Lion, facing inwards as worn by the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment, has been adopted as the regiment&#x27;s collar badge. The Lion of England is known as the regiment&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Badge&quot; and provides inspiration for the regimental nickname – first adopted by the 2nd Battalion in August 2009 – &quot;Lions of England&quot;. The lion is also used on the regiment&#x27;s tactical recognition flash.
*Glider Flash – the glider awarded, 1949, as an honour to the Border Regiment, for glider landings in Sicily on 9 July 1943, is worn on the sleeve of No. 1 and No. 2 dress. The glider also formed the regiment&#x27;s tactical recognition flash from its formation until 2014. 
*Fleur-de-Lys – the fleur-de-lys worn by the King&#x27;s Regiment is featured on the regiment&#x27;s buttons.

===Kingsman===
Alongside a few other regiments in the British Army that use traditional names other than Private for the lowest rank, The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment uses the rank &quot;Kingsman&quot; (Kgn) instead of Private, a tradition inherited from the King&#x27;s Regiment (itself having inherited the tradition from the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool)). Its use has been officially sanctioned since 1951, but it was informally used before this for over one hundred years.

<text>Fort Hamilton is a United States Army installation in the southwestern corner of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, surrounded by the communities of Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights. It is one of several posts that are part of the region which is headquartered by the Military District of Washington. Its mission is to provide the New York metropolitan area with military installation support for the Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve. The original fort was completed in 1831, with major additions made in the 1870s and 1900s. However, all defenses except about half of the original fort have been demolished or buried.

==History==
On July 4, 1776, a small American battery (the Narrows Fort) on the site of today&#x27;s Fort Hamilton (the east side of the Narrows) fired into one of the British men-of-war convoying troops to suppress the American Revolution. HMS &quot;Asia&quot; suffered damage and casualties, but opposition to the immense fleet could be little more than symbolic. However, this very significant event marked one of the earliest uses of the site for military purposes.
The War of 1812 underscored the importance of coastal defense (since the British burned parts of Washington, DC) and helped to promote a new round of fort building. The new forts, including Fort Hamilton, were eventually termed the third system of US seacoast forts. The cornerstone for Fort Hamilton was set in place by its designer, Simon Bernard, on June 11, 1825. Bernard was previously a French military engineer under Napoleon, who had joined the US Army after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815. Six years and a half million dollars later, the fort was ready to receive its garrison, initially Battery F of the 4th US Artillery.

Fort Hamilton (now the Casemate Fort, Whiting Quadrangle) was designed primarily as a landward defense for Fort Lafayette, although it had a sea-facing front as well. Fort Lafayette was offshore on Hendricks Reef, and was demolished in the 1960s to make room for the eastern tower of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Fort Hamilton was in the shape of a trapezoid, with the wide side facing the Narrows and the narrow side facing inland. It had two tiers of cannon all around: a casemated tier inside the fort and a barbette tier on the roof. Loopholes for muskets were provided on the three landward sides. A dry ditch also protected these three sides. A caponier, a rare feature in US forts, projected into the ditch to defend it against attack. Two smaller caponiers enclosed the ends of the ditch, projecting off the seacoast front. The fort&#x27;s sally port was in the middle of this front. A square redoubt with its own ditch was located behind the fort to provide an initial landward defense position.

Though references to the structure as Fort Hamilton occur as early as 1826, it was not officially named for the former Senior Officer of the United States Army and first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, until the twentieth century. In 1839 the Federal government gave permission to New York State&#x27;s 27th Regiment to drill at the fort, thus qualifying it as the nation&#x27;s first National Guard training camp. The following year, it allocated $20,000 to improve the fort&#x27;s armaments, and Captain Robert E. Lee, then an officer of the Army Corps of Engineers, was assigned the task of improving the defenses of the fort as well as those of other military installations in the area. Lee served as Fort Hamilton&#x27;s post engineer from 1841 to 1846 and is credited with the initial design of several subsequent New York-area forts, notably the rebuilt Fort Richmond and Fort Tompkins, along with the Fort at Willets Point and the Fort at Sandy Hook. Lieutenant Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson also served at Fort Hamilton, and Captain Abner Doubleday served as the post commander in 1861, shortly after serving at Fort Sumter during the bombardment that started the Civil War.
===Civil War===

During the Civil War, Fort Hamilton&#x27;s garrison expanded. A ship barrier across the Narrows assisted Fort Hamilton and its sister forts on Staten Island, now called Fort Wadsworth, in protecting the harbor against the possibility of Confederate raiders. The forts also provided troops to help put down the New York Draft Riots of 1863. Fort Hamilton also served as a prisoner-of-war camp, and an exterior &quot;New Battery&quot; of guns was added.

Rifled cannon made vertical-walled masonry fortifications obsolete during the Civil War. The first response of the US coast defense forces to this was a series of new batteries, with guns in open positions behind low earth walls and brick magazines with heavy earth cover between the guns. Most of these were located near existing forts. In 1871 construction began at Fort Hamilton on an 8-gun water battery and a 15-gun mortar battery, but the latter was never completed or armed. Money for these projects ran out in the late 1870s, and US coast defense languished, with few improvements completed for nearly 20 years.

===Endicott program===
The 1885 Board of Fortifications, chaired by Secretary of War William C. Endicott and also called the Endicott Board, recommended sweeping improvements to US coast defenses, with a new generation of modern breech-loading rifled guns and numerous new gun batteries. Most of the Board&#x27;s recommendations were adopted as the Endicott program, and that included major changes and improvements for Fort Hamilton. More than half of the old fort was demolished to make room for new concrete gun batteries. Fort Hamilton became part of the Artillery District of New York, renamed in 1913 as the Coast Defenses of Southern New York.

The following table shows the gun batteries completed at Fort Hamilton from 1898 to 1905. In most cases references do not indicate the precise model of gun or carriage at a particular battery, or the batteries&#x27; namesakes:

Several batteries (Burke, Johnston, Brown, and Griffin) were directly in front of the remains of the old fort, with Battery Griffin in front of and below the others. The other batteries extended in a line southeast of the old fort, with Battery Piper, the mortar battery, well to the rear of the line. Battery Griffin seems to have been designed as a mixed battery of two each M1898 and M1903 3-inch guns. The 4.72-inch guns of this battery were hastily added after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898; they were British guns purchased because most of the Endicott program was still years from completion. The 4.72-inch/45 caliber guns were transferred to Fort Kamehameha, Hawaii in 1913 to concentrate this type of weapon in one area. Battery Livingston was also an unusual combination of two disappearing 6-inch guns and two guns on pedestal mounts. Batteries Gillmore and Spear were originally a 7-gun battery under the former name, but were split up in 1903, probably for improved fire control.

===World War I===
The American entry into World War I brought many changes to Fort Hamilton, as at most other coast defense installations. Numerous temporary buildings were constructed to house the influx of new recruits, draftees, and units in training prior to deployment overseas. As the Coast Artillery was one of the Army&#x27;s few sources of trained personnel, the branch was chosen to operate almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war, most of which was French- or British-made. Most personnel at the forts were transferred to new heavy artillery regiments. Also, several of Fort Hamilton&#x27;s guns were dismounted for potential service on the Western Front; however, very few Army Coast Artillery weapons were actually used in that war, due to shipping priorities and extensive training. Battery Spear&#x27;s three 10-inch guns were dismounted for potential use as railway artillery. The eight 6-inch guns of Batteries Burke and Mendenhall were dismounted for potential use on field carriages. Two of these guns, along with four of Battery Piper&#x27;s 12-inch mortars, were used as the first batteries of Fort Tilden in nearby Far Rockaway, Queens. The removal of half of the mortars was also part of a forcewide program to improve the rate of fire of the remaining mortars. None of the weapons removed from Fort Hamilton in World War I were returned to the fort.

===Between the wars===
The end of World War I also meant more changes for Fort Hamilton. Around 1920 Battery Livingston&#x27;s pair of 6-inch disappearing guns were transferred to West Point to be used for training cadets. These two guns are preserved today at Fort Pickens near Pensacola, Florida and Battery Chamberlin at the Presidio of San Francisco, the last 6-inch disappearing guns outside of the Philippines. Battery Griffin&#x27;s pair of 3-inch M1898 guns was removed in 1920, part of a withdrawal from service of some gun types. In 1921 two long-range batteries of 12-inch guns were completed at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, and by 1924 the installation of 16-inch guns at Fort Tilden relegated Fort Hamilton to the second line of New York&#x27;s coast defenses. In 1937 Battery Neary&#x27;s pair of 12-inch guns was removed.

===World War II===
In World War II Fort Hamilton primarily served as a mobilization center, as it had in World War I. Except for the two remaining 6-inch pedestal guns of Battery Livingston and the pair of 3-inch guns at Battery Griffin, the remaining guns were gradually scrapped; the pair of 16-inch guns at the Highlands Military Reservation in New Jersey along with Fort Tilden superseded the older defenses. An anti-aircraft battery, probably of 90 mm guns, was at the fort during the war.

===Post World War II===
Shortly after World War II it was decided that gun coast defenses were obsolete. In 1948, the last coast defense gun was removed from Fort Hamilton. A battery of four 120 mm M1 guns was at the fort 1952-54, part of the Cold War air defense system. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the now-disused gun batteries were demolished or buried for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Belt Parkway.

===Units===

The following Regular Army units were established at Fort Hamilton:
* 12th Infantry Regiment: October 20, 1861
* 21st Infantry Regiment: May 20, 1862
* 5th Coast Artillery Regiment, 1924

In the 1960s, Fort Hamilton also served as the home for the United States Army Chaplain School as it moved from the recently closed Fort Slocum. Hundreds of Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard Chaplains and their assistants were trained here for active duty and reserve ministries to soldiers and their dependents. The school was later moved across the Narrows to Fort Wadsworth, and still later to Fort Jackson, South Carolina where it now resides.

==Today==
Fort Hamilton is the only active-duty DoD military post in New York City. Fort Hamilton was once a sister fortification to Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island. The two forts were part of a system of military installations in New York City, including Fort Tilden and Fort Totten in Queens; Fort Wood and Governors Island in Manhattan; Hart Island and Fort Schuyler in the Bronx; and Brooklyn Army Terminal, Brooklyn Navy Yard and Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.

At present, U.S. Army Fort Hamilton Garrison is the home of the New York City Recruiting Battalion, the Military Entrance Processing Station, the North Atlantic Division Headquarters of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the 1179th Transportation Brigade and the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, the latter organization being a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 439th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command. Fort Hamilton also supports many Army Reserve and New York Army National Guard units, These Army National Guard units include the 133d Quartermaster Company, Company C/642d Aviation Support Battalion, 222d Chemical Company, and the 107th Military Police Company. Currently Fort Hamilton is under Installation Management Command headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, TX.

The construction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in the early 1960s did away with several historic structures, including Fort Lafayette, which was located near the Brooklyn shore where the bridge tower now rises from the water. During the same period, efforts toward saving the historical heritage of the Narrows increased. Part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s contribution to preserving this heritage is in the Harbor Defense Museum at Fort Hamilton.

The original fort later became the Officers&#x27; Club and now houses the Community Club. The caponier, a miniature fort guarding the main fort&#x27;s gate, now houses the Harbor Defense Museum. Other notable landmarks include the Robert E. Lee House, where Lee, then a captain, resided while post engineer of the garrison, and Colonels&#x27; Row, six historic townhouses that used to house senior officers. All of these structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 2000s, the historic parade field that once lay behind the old New York Area Command (NYAC) Headquarters Building and the Military Personnel Office, former site of numerous ceremonies and festivities, was developed into swiftly built privatized housing. The historic flag pole and cannon are still present at the site, near the old headquarters building and across from the Post Exchange barber shop.

In 2007, the historic brick barracks, located on the plot of land within Pershing Loop on the eastern portion of the base, which formerly housed the New York Area Command&#x27;s Ceremonial Platoon and Military Police Company, was demolished. The ceremonial platoon, consisting of only infantrymen, once performed funeral honors and ceremonial functions (such as deployment as color guards in New York City parades, or firing cannons to start the New York City Marathon), in the greater N.Y. area, including Long Island, New York City, as well as parts of New Jersey, along with the 26th Army Band unit that was similar to the Old Guard in Washington, D.C.

A Civil War-era experimental 20-inch Rodman gun, one of two remaining and the largest gun produced by either side in that period, is in John Paul Jones Park immediately north of the fort. Numerous shells for this weapon are displayed on the fort grounds. An ex-Navy 12&quot;/45 caliber Mark V Mod 8 gun is also displayed on post, representative of the type of weapon the fort had in the Endicott era.

==Education==
On-post residents, including their dependents, are in the New York City Department of Education school district. There are no schools within the boundary of the military installation. The zoned K-8 school is P.S./I.S. 104 The Fort Hamilton School, and the public high school in the area is Fort Hamilton High School.

==In popular culture==
In Marvel Comics, the second issue of &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; (1982) has a primary character reporting that Cobra prisoners will be delivered to the stockade located on Fort Hamilton.

Fort Hamilton is featured prominently in &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; season 19 episode 18, titled &quot;Service&quot;.

Fort Hamilton is the setting for nearly all of Nelson DeMille&#x27;s novel &quot;Word of Honor&quot;.

In &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot;, Jane Bradshaw&#x27;s (Susan Blakely) father (Bill van Sleet) is an Army officer newly assigned to Fort Hamilton. Jane&#x27;s parents tell her on their way out to dinner that they can be reached at the Fort Hamilton officers&#x27; club that evening.

<doc id="1306367" wikidata="Q2347350" url="?curid=1306367" title="Steve Tasker">
<text>Steven Jay Tasker (born April 10, 1962) is an American sports reporter and former professional football wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He spent the majority of his career with the Buffalo Bills but began his career with the Houston Oilers. He was a five-time first-team All-Pro and a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, primarily as a special teams player.

Tasker played college football at Dodge City Community College in Kansas before playing for the Northwestern Wildcats. He was selected in the ninth round of the 1985 NFL draft by the Oilers. Tasker played most of his pro career with Buffalo, and was voted by Bills fans to the team&#x27;s 50th season All-time Team. After retiring from playing, he has worked as a reporter, currently serving locally in Western New York on the MSG Western New York cable TV station, and on WGR Radio and formerly for CBS Sports.

In 2008, the NFL Network show &quot;NFL Top 10&quot; ranked Tasker the ninth-best former player not enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He has several times been a nominee for the Hall, making the semi-finalist list eight times, but has not been selected as a member as of 2024.

==College career==
Tasker first attended Dodge City Community College. After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University where he played the final two years of his college career before joining the National Football League. Tasker finished his college career with 1,055 combined return yards from punts and kickoffs, averaging 10.8 yards per punt return. After finishing his college football career, and before being drafted into the NFL, he joined the school&#x27;s rugby team. Although he had never played rugby before, he was named most valuable player at the Big Ten Conference Tournament. Tasker continues to hold the Northwestern Wildcats football career record for kickoff return average (24.3).

==Professional football career==
Tasker was selected in the ninth round (226th overall) of the 1985 NFL draft by the Houston Oilers where he played for two seasons. He was claimed off waivers by the Buffalo Bills on November 8, 1986.

Tasker was listed as a wide receiver, however, most of his playing time came as a gunner, on punts and kickoffs. After he joined the Buffalo Bills, he began to play at wide receiver more than with the Oilers. While he performed very well as a receiver when Buffalo needed his services there, the combination of excellent Bills depth at that position, his value as a special teams playmaker, and Tasker refusing to demand more playing time on offense kept his WR time very slight.

Still, Tasker did make contributions at the more traditional role on offense and special teams. In a 1994 playoff game against the Los Angeles Raiders, he set up the Bills first touchdown with a 67-yard kickoff return. He also caught 5 passes for 108 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo&#x27;s 1995 playoff win against the Miami Dolphins.

===Play on special teams===
Tasker stood tall and weighed ; when he joined the Bills, Jim Haslett did not think that he was a player. Tasker recalled, &quot;I told him not to worry because I was mistaken for a ball boy all the time&quot;. Despite his small size, he gained a reputation as one of the league&#x27;s most feared hitters, forcing numerous fumbles. Contributing to his success in breaking up kick and punt returns was his speed; he was almost always the first player to reach the return man. He was the first player to establish himself as a star almost exclusively through special teams play without being a kicker or a frequent returner. Tasker played in seven Pro Bowls (1987 and 1990–1995) and became the only special teamer ever to be named the game&#x27;s MVP in 1993.

* 204 special teams tackles 
* 7 blocked punts
* 7-time Pro Bowl selection
* Only special teams player ever elected Pro Bowl MVP
* Was voted one of 26 players by the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the year 2000 as &quot;The Best of the Best ALL TIME Players in the History of the Game&quot;

He was ranked No. 9 on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;NFL Top 10&quot; Players Not in the Hall of Fame.

Many, including former teammate and Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly, consider him to be the greatest special teams player of all-time and believe that he should be in the Hall of Fame. 

==Sportscasting career==
Tasker was a color commentator for CBS football telecasts with Andrew Catalon (play-by-play) and Steve Beuerlein (the other color commentator) starting in 2014. CBS did not renew his contract at the end of the 2018 season. He also does color commentary for the local broadcasts of Bills pre-season games, teaming with either his former broadcast partner Andrew Catalon or Rob Stone. He is also the spokesperson for the West Herr Auto Group. Tasker was on the sidelines with Jim Nantz and Phil Simms during the playoffs until 2013. He also worked with Don Criqui (Criqui, himself a Buffalo native, and Tasker were assigned to the majority of Bills games from 1999 to 2005) and was best known working with Gus Johnson in 1998, week 13 in 1999, week 5 in 2004, and from 2005 to 2010. Johnson left for FOX Sports the following year. He and Johnson called the David Garrard game winning Hail Mary touchdown pass for the Jacksonville Jaguars&#x27; win over the Houston Texans in 2010. CBS dismissed Tasker prior to the 2019 season as they chose not to renew his contract.

On September 9, 2007, Tasker became the 24th person inducted to the Bills&#x27; Wall of Fame.

On November 22, 2011, Tasker was named one of the semifinalists in balloting for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

On September 28, 2013, his son, Luke Tasker, made his Canadian Football League debut with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, in a home game against the Calgary Stampeders. Luke Tasker also became a broadcaster during and after his playing career, becoming the Tiger-Cats&#x27; color commentator.

In April 2018, Tasker became co-host of &quot;One Bills Live&quot;, a daily weekday radio show focusing on the Buffalo Bills alongside Chris Brown on WGR and MSG Western New York. He served as the color commentator and analyst for the Buffalo Bills Radio Network in 2020 alongside John Murphy after Eric Wood opted out of the season due to traveling difficulties associated with the coronavirus pandemic.

==Personal life==
Steve is married with five children. His son Luke, played wide receiver for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Canadian Football League. They reside in East Aurora, New York.

<doc id="1306385" wikidata="Q7713458" url="?curid=1306385" title="The American Crisis">
<text>The American Crisis, or simply The Crisis, is a pamphlet series by eighteenth-century Enlightenment philosopher and author Thomas Paine, originally published from 1776 to 1783 during the American Revolution. Thirteen numbered pamphlets were published between 1776 and 1777, with three additional pamphlets released between 1777 and 1783. The first of the pamphlets was published in &quot;The Pennsylvania Journal&quot; on December 19, 1776. Paine signed the pamphlets with the pseudonym, &quot;Common Sense&quot;.

The pamphlets were contemporaneous with early parts of the American Revolution, when colonists needed inspiring works. &quot;The American Crisis&quot; series was used to &quot;recharge the revolutionary cause.&quot; Paine, like many other politicians and scholars, knew that the colonists were not going to support the American Revolutionary War without proper reason to do so. Written in a language that the common person could understand, they represented Paine&#x27;s liberal philosophy. Paine also used references to God, saying that a war against Great Britain would be a war with the support of God. Paine&#x27;s writings bolstered the morale of the American colonists, appealed to the British people&#x27;s consideration of the war, clarified the issues at stake in the war, and denounced the advocates of a negotiated peace. The first volume famously begins: &quot;These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls.&quot;

==Themes==
Winter 1776 was a time of need in the colonies, considering Philadelphia and the entire rebel American cause were on the verge of death and the revolution was still viewed as an unsteady prospect. Paine wanted to enable the distraught patriots to stand, to persevere, and to fight for an American victory. Paine published the first &quot;Crisis&quot; paper on December 19.

Its opening sentence was adopted as the watchword of the movement to Trenton. The opening lines are as follows:

These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.

Paine brought together the thirteen diverse colonies and encouraged them to stay motivated through the harsh conditions of the winter of 1776. Washington&#x27;s troops were ready to quit until ordered by Washington to be read aloud Paine&#x27;s &quot;Crisis&quot; paper and heard the first sentence, “These are the times that try men’s souls.” The pamphlet, read aloud to the Continental Army on December 23, 1776, three days before the Battle of Trenton, attempted to bolster morale and resistance among patriots, as well as shame neutrals and loyalists to support the cause:

Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.

Along with the patriotic nature of &quot;The American Crisis&quot;, the series of papers displayed Paine&#x27;s strong deist beliefs, inciting the laity with suggestions that the British are trying to assume powers that only God should have. Paine saw the British political and military maneuvers in the colonies as &quot;impious; for so unlimited a power can belong only to God.&quot; Paine stated that he believed that God supported the cause of the American colonists, &quot;that God Almighty will not give up a people to military destruction, or leave them unsupportedly to perish, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent&quot;.

Paine goes to great lengths to state that American colonists do not lack force but &quot;a proper application of that force,&quot; implying throughout that an extended war could lead only to defeat unless a stable army was composed not of militia but of trained professionals. Paine maintains a positive view overall, hoping that the American crisis could be resolved quickly &quot;for though the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine, the coal can never expire. and goes on to state that Great Britain has no right to invade the colonies, saying that it is a power belonging &quot;only to God. Paine also asserts that &quot;if being bound in that manner is not slavery, then there is not such a thing as slavery on earth.&quot; Paine obviously believes that Great Britain is essentially trying to enslave the American colonists. He then opines a little about how the panicking of the sudden Revolutionary War has both hindered and helped the colonists.

Paine then speaks of his experience in the Battle of Fort Lee and the colonists&#x27; subsequent retreat. Afterward, Paine remarks on an experience with a Loyalist. He says the man told his child, &quot;&#x27;Well! give me peace in my day,&#x27;&quot; meaning he did not want the war to happen in his lifetime. Paine says that this is very &quot;unfatherly&quot; and the man should want the war to happen in his time so it does not happen in his child&#x27;s time. Paine then gives some advice on how to do better in the war. Paragraph 1 is about the present. The present is a time to secure the celestial article of freedom and merit the honor of commercial appreciation. Paine encourages the colonists to value victory and its consequent freedom because “the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph”—“what we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly,” he notes, and “ it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.” &quot;Crisis&quot; No. 1 concludes with a few paragraphs of encouragement, a vivid description of what will happen if colonists act like cowards and give up, and the closing statement, &quot;Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it unlamented.&quot;

==Dates and places of publication==

&quot;The Crisis&quot; series appeared in a range of publication formats, sometimes (as in the first four) as stand-alone pamphlets and sometimes in one or more newspapers. In several cases, too, Paine addressed his writing to a particular audience, while in other cases he left his addressee unstated, writing implicitly to the American public (who were, of course, his actually intended audience at all times).

&quot;Crisis&quot; No. 2, addressed &quot;To Lord Howe,&quot; begins, &quot;Universal empire is the prerogative of a writer.&quot; Paine makes plain his judgment that Howe was but a sycophant of George III: &quot;Perhaps you thought America too was taking a nap, and therefore chose, like Satan to Eve, to whisper the delusion softly, lest you should awaken her. This continent, Sir, is too extensive to sleep all at once, and too watchful, even in its slumbers, not to startle at the unhallowed foot of an invader.&quot; Paine makes it clear that he believes that George is not up to his former standards when it came to his duties with the American colonies. Paine also sheds light onto what he felt the future would hold for the emerging country, &quot;The United States of America, will sound as pompously in the world, or in history [as] the Kingdom of Great Britain; the character of General Washington will fill a page with as much luster as that of Lord Howe; and Congress have as much right to command the king and parliament of London to desist from legislation, as they or you have to command the Congress.&quot;

Paine then goes on to try to bargain with George: &quot;Why, God bless me! What have you to do with our independence? we asked no leave of yours to set it up, we asked no money of yours to support it; we can do better without your fleets and armies than with them; you may soon have enough to do to protect yourselves, without being burthened with us. We are very willing to be at peace with you, to buy of you and sell to you, and, like young beginners in the world, to work for our own living; therefore, why do you put yourselves out of cash, when we know you cannot spare it, and we do not desire you to run you into debt?&quot; In the conclusion Paine explains that he considers &quot;independence as America&#x27;s natural right and interest, and never could see any real disservice it would be to Britain.&quot;

<text>Quentin Tremaine Jammer (born June 19, 1979) is an American former professional football player who played twelve seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a cornerback for the San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos, with whom he went to Super Bowl XLVIII. He played college football for the University of Texas where he earned unanimous All-American honors and became a first round draft pick of the San Diego Chargers in the 2002 NFL draft.

== Early life ==
Jammer was born in Bay City, Texas, and attended Angleton High School. In high school football, he was a two-time all-district safety, cornerback, linebacker, wide receiver, and quarterback as a senior, and was the district&#x27;s defensive most valuable player. He also won three letters in track and field, and participated in the long jump, 100-meter dash, and the 200-meter dash. In 1997, he was selected for the state all-star football team, which included future San Diego Chargers teammates LaDainian Tomlinson and Drew Brees.

== College career ==
Jammer attended the University of Texas at Austin, and played for coach Mack Brown&#x27;s Texas Longhorns football team from 1997 to 2001, though he sat out the 1999 season after suffering a shoulder injury in the first game. As a freshman, he played in every game and was a starter by the start of his sophomore year. He was a first-team All-Big 12 Conference selection following his junior and senior seasons, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American as a senior in 2001. He was named team co-MVP his senior year and recorded seven interceptions as well as 195 tackles throughout his collegiate career. He set the school record for pass breakups with 57 and helped the team win the 1999 Cotton Bowl Classic, the 1999 and 2001 Big 12 South Championships and the 2001 Holiday Bowl.

== Professional career ==
=== San Diego Chargers ===
Jammer was selected by the San Diego Chargers with the fifth overall pick in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft. Due to a holdout to start the 2002 season, he was not ready to make an impact his rookie year and started only four games. The following year, in 2003, Jammer started at the cornerback position. Coming into the NFL, Jammer was touted as being a physical player rather than a finesse cover cornerback. The transition to the NFL was difficult because the physical style of play that brought him so much success in college often resulted in pass interference calls. Jammer led the NFL in pass interference calls in 2004 with eight. Jammer suffered another setback in his development when the NFL made an officiating point of emphasis in 2004 that penalized defensive players for touching receivers further than five yards past the line of scrimmage. In an interview with Rick Gosselin of The Dallas Morning News, Jammer said, &quot;All the rule changes for the offense have altered the game. It&#x27;s turned football into track with pads. Before you know it, the receivers are going to have a free run at you. You can&#x27;t touch them at all. The rules got me away from my game,&quot; Jammer said. &quot;When physical corners start finessing it, that&#x27;s not their style.&quot;

Jammer was criticized for his lack of interceptions, though he was still considered a valuable part of the team. In 62 career games leading up to the 2006 season, Jammer had only recorded six interceptions, including just two total in the 2004 and 2005 seasons. When the Chargers extended Jammer&#x27;s contract during the 2006 offseason, Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union Tribune wrote that &quot;... he is widely considered by Chargers fans to be among the team&#x27;s weak links, mostly for the fact he has just six career interceptions.&quot; Acee later wrote of Jammer: &quot;In recent seasons Jammer has been without a doubt the most vilified Charger. It was difficult to tell whether he was disliked (perhaps too mild a term) more for what he did (get called for a lot of penalties) or what he didn&#x27;t do (make interceptions). It&#x27;s possible in the past decade there has been only one other Charger (do we really need to say his name?) who drew more wrath from the faithful.&quot;

During Jammer&#x27;s first four years with the Chargers, the team regularly finished at or near the bottom of the league in terms of pass defense. Except for the 2003 season, the team was in the bottom five in terms of pass defense every year from 2002 to 2005. This led many Charger fans to become frustrated with Jammer, as due to his high draft position he became a symbol for the Chargers&#x27; failure to assemble a solid secondary. In turn, Jammer was often at odds with fans over their criticisms. In a September 2005 interview, Jammer said of the fans: &quot;Those people are idiots. (They) don&#x27;t know anything about football...They&#x27;re not going to bother me.&quot; Many fans could often be heard chanting, &quot;Lito, Lito&quot; every time Jammer was beaten by a receiver, a reference to Lito Sheppard, the two-time Pro-Bowl cornerback of the Philadelphia Eagles who was taken after Jammer in the 2002 draft.

In his later years with the team, supporters of Jammer noted that the Chargers had a poor pass defense not because of Jammer, but because of their anemic pass rush. But in 2005, the Chargers had one of the top front 7s in the NFL, featuring Pro Bowler and NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award winner Shawne Merriman and Pro Bowler Jamal Williams. Despite this fearsome pass rush, the Chargers still finished 28th in the league in pass defense. A reason for this may be that the 3-4 defense, which the Chargers used under Ted Cottrell, typically has larger, slower players in the front seven than in the respective positions in the 4–3, leaving more pressure on the defensive backs.

During training camp Jammer signed a new five-year contract extension that ran through the 2012 season. The 2006 offseason saw an overhaul of the Chargers&#x27; secondary after many disappointing years. The team signed former Carolina Panthers safety Marlon McCree as a free agent, and they spent a first-round draft choice on cornerback Antonio Cromartie. McCree&#x27;s veteran presence had an immediate impact on the secondary, including Jammer, who surpassed his 2005 interception total in only the third game of the season. Although Jammer only recorded one more interception in the remaining 13 games, the 2006 season was his best and most consistent as a pro. Towards the middle of the season, Jammer showed signs of turning into a shutdown cornerback, and QBs rarely threw at him. He closed out the Chargers 21–14 win over Oakland on November 26 with an interception on the first play after the two-minute warning. He finished the season leading the team in interceptions with 4 and with a career-high in tackles helping the Chargers finished 13th in the league in pass defense.

Jammer critics point to the 3rd and 10, long bomb Reche Caldwell caught in the divisional playoff game against the New England Patriots as a sign that Jammer was still not meeting expectations. Jammer, in blitz-scheme, short area press coverage, was not able to help the defense recover from an ineffective jailhouse blitz and Patriots&#x27; quarterback Tom Brady comfortably stepped up in the pocket to loft a deep strike to Caldwell. Despite Brady&#x27;s completion to Caldwell, Jammer had a strong day limiting Patriot receivers, in the 2007 AFC Championship game against the Patriots, he had an outstanding performance, limiting Randy Moss to 1 reception for 12 yards, and intercepting Tom Brady once.

In week 6 of the 2012 season, Jammer recorded his first interception returned for a touchdown in his career on a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning.

=== Denver Broncos ===
On May 29, 2013, Jammer signed with the Denver Broncos. The Broncos went to Super Bowl XLVIII that year, but Jammer was inactive for that game - a game they lost. The Broncos chose to keep Marquice Cole active instead as Jammer had &quot;struggled down the stretch.&quot; Following the season, he became a free agent and, during the following training camp time, Jammer returned to San Diego where he worked out on a full-time basis in the hopes of landing an NFL job for at least one more year, but he wasn&#x27;t signed by anyone. His last NFL game was the AFC Championship win against New England.

==NFL career statistics==
== Personal life ==

Jammer has three sons. His cousins are former NFL players Johnnie Lee Higgins, Cedric Woodard and Darren Woodard. His half-brother is NFL player Quandre Diggs.

Jammer made an appearance on an episode of &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; in 2009. Jammer appeared as himself in Season 13 episode 20, which originally aired on November 18, 2009.

He later went into Jiu-Jitsu and made it to the quarterfinals of the World Master IBJJF Jiu-Jitsu Championship in 2018. He also started his own clothing company.

* Schlitz, Germany

==Economy==
Bogyiszló is an agricultural village. It is known for the Bogyiszló white-skinned pepper. With the eradication of the forest that once covered the floodplain, the area was found to be ideal for growing both sweet, and hot varieties of pepper, as well as the red peppers used in making paprika. The area is also noted for its forestry, fishing, and hunting traditions.

<doc id="1306405" wikidata="Q143823" url="?curid=1306405" title="Postfeminism">
<text>Postfeminism (alternatively rendered as post-feminism) is an alleged decrease in popular support for feminism from the 1990s onwards. It can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, femininity and popular culture. The term is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as fourth-wave feminism, postmodern feminism, and xenofeminism.

Research conducted at Kent State University in the 2000s narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label &quot;feminist&quot; has a negative stigma.

==History of the term==
In 1919 a journal was launched in which &quot;female literary radicals&quot; stated we&#x27;re interested in people now—not in men and women, that &quot;moral, social, economic, and political standards &#x27;should not have anything to do with sex, that it would &quot;be &#x27;pro-woman without being anti-man, and that &quot;their stance [is called] &#x27;post-feminist.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin&#x27;s 1982 article &quot;Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation&quot;, published in &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.

In the 1990s the term became popular in academia and the media and was used in both complimentary and dismissive ways. Since then there has been confusion surrounding the intended meaning of &quot;post&quot; in the context of &quot;postfeminism&quot;. &quot;Post&quot; offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with &quot;post&quot; when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.

Contemporarily the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women &quot;who are thought to benefit from the women&#x27;s movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change&quot;, Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts.

===Other uses===
Toril Moi used the term in &quot;Sexual/Textual Politics&quot; (1985) to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality-based or liberal feminism and difference-based or radical feminism.

In &quot;Lacan and Postfeminism&quot; (2000), author Elizabeth Wright identified a &quot;positive reading&quot; of postfeminism that, instead of indicating an overcoming of feminism, refers to post-structuralist critiques of second-wave feminism. From a similar perspective, Diane Davis affirmed that postfeminism is just a continuation of what first and second wave feminisms want.

In &quot;Feminism: A Beginner’s Guide (2010)&quot;, Sally Scholz referred to the fourth wave as postfeminism.

==Works==
In her 1994 book &quot;Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women&quot;, Christina Hoff Sommers considers much of modern academic feminist theory and the feminist movement to be gynocentric. She labels this &quot;gender feminism&quot; and proposes &quot;equity feminism&quot;—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism. These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.

Some contemporary feminists, such as Katha Pollitt or Nadine Strossen, consider feminism to hold simply that &quot;women are people.&quot; Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be &quot;sexist&quot; rather than &quot;feminist&quot;.

==Relation to pop culture==
Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists. Many popular shows from the 1990s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women. Such shows and movies include &quot;The Devil Wears Prada, , The Princess Diaries, Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.

Postfeminist literature—also known as chick lit—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction. Examples can also be found in &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series&#x27; protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.

==Criticism==
Susan Faludi argues in &quot;&quot; (1991) that a backlash against second-wave feminism had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. It was constructed by the media and, without reliable evidence, pointed women&#x27;s liberation movement as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.

Similarly, Amelia Jones claims that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.

Angela McRobbie suggests that adding the prefix &quot;post-&quot; to &quot;feminism&quot; undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie&#x27;s opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. She believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary, Sex and the City&quot;, and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Female characters like Bridget Jones and Carrie Bradshaw claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of &#x27;postfeminist&#x27; femininity has given rise to a neoliberal hybrid &quot;pronounced sense of self or &#x27;I-dentity&#x27;&quot;. She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that &quot;through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo&quot;. Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.

<doc id="1306406" wikidata="Q2346817" url="?curid=1306406" title="Steve Atwater">
<text>Stephen Dennis Atwater (born October 28, 1966) is an American former professional football player who was a safety for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). He was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and two-time Super Bowl champion. Atwater was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 1, 2020.

Atwater and Dennis Smith made up a Broncos secondary that was known for their ferocious hits on opposing players.

==Early life==
Atwater attended Lutheran High School North in St. Louis, Missouri and was the school&#x27;s top athlete, playing football, basketball, and track. Atwater was selected all-conference and league Most Valuable Player as an option style quarterback. He credits his coach there, Mike Russell, as serving as a mentor for him both as a football player and becoming an exemplary citizen. Atwater also is sixth on Lutheran North&#x27;s all-time passing yards in a season with 1,097 yards in his junior year.

==College career==
Atwater signed with the University of Arkansas, where he was moved from quarterback to safety. He was named to the All-Southwest Conference team three times and named as an All-American twice.

During his senior year, Atwater helped the 1988 Arkansas Razorbacks football team finish the season at 10-2 and win the Southwest Conference championship outright, but lost to UCLA and QB Troy Aikman in the 1989 Cotton Bowl Classic on New Year&#x27;s Day. 1988 bookended his college career since Arkansas also finished 10–2 after beating Arizona State 18–17 in the 1985 Holiday Bowl during Atwater&#x27;s freshman season.

Helping Atwater&#x27;s stock as a pro prospect was his appearance in the East-West Shrine Game, where he logged two interceptions. He was also named defensive most valuable player in the 1989 East-West Shrine Game.

He still holds the school record with 14 interceptions in his career.

In 1994, Atwater was named to the Razorback All-Century Team and the All-Decade Team for the 1980s. He was inducted into the University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor in 1998.

==Professional career==
Atwater was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (20th overall) of the 1989 NFL draft. New defensive coordinator Wade Phillips employed Atwater close to the line of scrimmage in order to fortify Denver&#x27;s run defense and he led the team in tackles, finishing with 129 tackles his rookie season. Denver&#x27;s defense jumped 20 spots to finish 7th against the run and tied for 3rd best in yards per carry with a 3.7-yard average. That same year, Atwater finished 2nd to the Kansas City Chiefs&#x27; Derrick Thomas in Defensive Rookie of the Year voting. The additions of rookies Atwater and Bobby Humphrey, along with key free agent signings, helped Denver rebound from 8–8 in 1988 to AFC Super Bowl representative in 1989.

Atwater&#x27;s second season marked the first of seven consecutive Pro Bowl selections (1990–96), tied for most in franchise history. Over his career, he was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times, second-most in franchise history. Early in his career, Atwater teamed with fellow Broncos safety Dennis Smith to form one of the best safety tandems of their generation. Both would later be inducted into the Broncos Ring of Fame. During his 10-year career in Denver, Atwater started in 155 games, tying him for seventh in franchise history for games started. He also started in 14 post-season games.

One of Atwater&#x27;s career highlights happened on September 17, 1990, during a Monday Night Football telecast from Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. As Kansas City Chiefs massive 260 lbs. running back Christian Okoye came through a hole in the line of scrimmage, he was met by Atwater. The resulting collision stopped Okoye in his tracks, with Atwater standing over him, taunting the proclaimed &quot;Nigerian Nightmare&quot;, while he lay on the ground stunned. His coach Mike Shanahan stated &quot;That&#x27;s the hit people will remember him for.&quot;

In Super Bowl XXXII, he posted one of the better performances by a safety in a Super Bowl and one of the greatest games of his career. In that game, he is credited with six solo tackles, one sack, two passes defensed and a forced fumble. His presence near the line of scrimmage kept the Green Bay Packers&#x27; running game in check. His sack and forced fumble resulted in three critical points in the second quarter when the Broncos offense had stalled without star running back Terrell Davis. Near the end of the fourth quarter, the game was tied at 24 and Green Bay had the ball on 3rd down &amp; 8. Atwater knocked down a critical pass on a blitz where the receiver was left wide open, forcing the Packers to punt. Then on Green Bay&#x27;s final drive, Atwater&#x27;s vicious hit (which nearly knocked out three players, including Atwater, Packers wide receiver Robert Brooks, and his teammate, Broncos cornerback Randy Hilliard) with less than a minute remaining left the Packers in 4th and 6 situation without any remaining timeouts, due to NFL rules regarding injuries to players in the final two minutes of a game. Many argued that Atwater should have been the MVP of the game and the ensuing article in &quot;The Sporting News&quot; pictured Atwater and noted the impact of his hits on the game.

Super Bowl XXXII was Atwater&#x27;s last great game, and 1997 his last great season. In 1998, he was relegated to only playing on 1st and 2nd downs and replaced on 3rd downs. Nevertheless, because of the viewership of the Super Bowl from the previous year, he was voted as an AFC Pro Bowl starter for an eighth and final time. Following the Pro Bowl voting, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; noted that Atwater&#x27;s selection to the Pro Bowl was due to his play in the previous year&#x27;s Super Bowl. Denver went on to win the Super Bowl for a second straight year, marking Super Bowl XXXIII as Atwater&#x27;s final game with the Broncos.

Atwater left the Broncos following the 1998 season, signing with the New York Jets as a free agent for his final season in 1999. Atwater played for the New York Jets for one season and became a free agent. He called Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, asking him if he could retire as a Bronco. He signed a one-day ceremonial contract with the Broncos before announcing his retirement from football. He thanked several of his coaches, stating &quot;I bleed orange and will always bleed orange and blue.&quot; At the time of his retirement, he played in 155 consecutive games with the Broncos. Bowlen called Atwater one of the Broncos&#x27; &quot;greatest players&quot;.

<text>Simon L. Leis Jr. (; born June 12, 1934) is a lawyer and local official from Cincinnati, Ohio. He served as County Prosecutor for Hamilton County (1971–1983), a judge in the Court of Common Pleas (1983–1987), and the county sheriff (1987–2012).

==Biography==
Leis is the son of Simon Leis Sr., a judge in Common Pleas Court. The younger Leis graduated from St. Xavier High School in 1952. After graduating from Xavier University, he served in the U.S. Marines, then studied law in night courses at the Salmon P. Chase College of Law (now part of Northern Kentucky University). He was admitted to the bar and began the practice of law as an assistant in the prosecutor&#x27;s office.

In 1971 Simon was appointed County Prosecutor to replace Melvin Reuger, who had resigned to become a judge. He won re-election three times and served until 1983. His term as prosecutor was marked by several events. His 1974 disclosures during a prostitution investigation forced the resignation of City Councilman Jerry Springer (although Springer was elected again and later became mayor).

Leis led two high-profile trials, both times earning a conviction, and both later overturned by appellate courts. In 1976 he convicted Cincinnati&#x27;s Police Chief, Carl Goodin, for taking kick-backs. In 1977 he convicted Larry Flynt, the publisher of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine, on obscenity charges. This second case was the basis for a 1996 movie, &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, in which his role was played by political operative James Carville.

Leis retired as Hamilton County Sheriff in 2012, and was succeeded by Jim Neil.

<text>Wieringerwerf is a town in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon, and lies about southeast of Den Helder. It is situated in a polder. The elevation of the village is below sea level. Dikes and pumping engines keep the land dry. 

==History==

In 1936 the construction of the village began, a few years after the reclamation of the polder. Because of an employment project that was subsidised by the state, inhabitants from all over the country came to the Wieringermeer to help build an infrastructure. In only short time houses, shops, churches and schools rose in Wieringerwerf. Near the town a &quot;terp&quot; was built, an artificial hill that could serve as a refuge in case of an eventual bursting of the IJsselmeer dike. 

On 1 July 1941 Wieringermeer became an independent municipality. On 29 September of the same year, the first inhabitants of the new land gave a memorial to the new mayor and aldermen. This statue, entitled &quot;De Maaier&quot; (The Mower), can be found on a square in the town centre. The inscription says: &quot;Here a future was built, keep building.&quot;

On 17 April 1945 the Germans bombed the dike and within two days the complete polder was all water again (see also inundation of the Wieringermeer). Most inhabitants fled inland to higher ground, but a few found their refuge on the man-made terp. On 11 December 1945 the polder was reclaimed again, so the building of Wieringerwerf could start for a second time. Nowadays, a monument and a deep pool still mark the location of the bursting.

In the decades after the reconstruction Wieringerwerf always had a growing population. Several quarters were built around the town centre. The town is still growing, so the inscription of the statue &quot;De Mower&quot; still finds a response.

==Statistics==

In 2001, the town of Wieringerwerf had 5661 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was , and contained 2285 residences. The wider statistical area of Wieringerwerf has a population of around 5700.

<text>Edward Thomas McCaffrey (born August 17, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 13 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers, and Denver Broncos. He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal, earning first-team All-America honors in 1990.

Regarded as one of the best blocking wide receivers of all time, McCaffrey is a three-time Super Bowl champion (XXIX, XXXII, XXXIII), a second-team All-Pro selection in 1998, and a member of the Broncos&#x27; 50th anniversary team. He is the father of football players Max, Christian, Dylan, and Luke McCaffrey.

==Early life==
McCaffrey was born on August 17, 1968, in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania and attended Allentown Central Catholic High School in Allentown, where he played football in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference. He also was a standout basketball player for Allentown Central Catholic High School, leading the school to Pennsylvania state titles in 1984 and 1986.

===College===
McCaffrey attended Stanford University, where he played college football for the Cardinal. He finished his Stanford career as the school&#x27;s fifth all-time leader in receptions (146) and third all-time leader in receiving yards (2,333). He earned first-team All-America and All-Pac-10 Conference honors as a senior in 1990, catching 61 passes for 917 yards and eight touchdowns that season. McCaffrey was enshrined in Stanford&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame in 1990. At Stanford, he also was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

==National Football League==
McCaffrey entered the 1991 NFL draft and was selected by the New York Giants in the third round (83rd overall). During his thirteen-year career, he won three Super Bowl rings, Super Bowl XXIX with the San Francisco 49ers and Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII with the Denver Broncos and was named to the Pro Bowl in 1998.

With the Denver Broncos, he became a reliable target for quarterback John Elway, set a Broncos record for most receptions in a season at the time with 101 receptions in the 2000 season, and had an exceptional performance in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Atlanta Falcons, recording five catches for 72 yards. In 2000, McCaffrey and teammate Rod Smith became only the second wide receiver duo from the same team to each gain 100 receptions in the same season, matching a record by Herman Moore and Brett Perriman.

In the opening game of the Broncos&#x27; 2001 season, McCaffrey suffered a leg fracture in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the New York Giants. He rebounded in the 2002 season for the Broncos, registering 69 receptions and 903 yards. Hampered by injuries during a disappointing 2003 season, McCaffrey retired on February 29, 2004. He finished his career with 565 career receptions for 7,422 yards along with 55 touchdowns. During his tenure, he was known by the nicknames &quot;Easy,&quot; “Eddie Mac,” “White Lightning,” and “The Bruise.”

<doc id="1306429" wikidata="Q6767816" url="?curid=1306429" title="Mark Clayton (American football, born 1961)">
<text>Mark Gregory Clayton (born April 8, 1961) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League, primarily with the Miami Dolphins. He played college football for the Louisville Cardinals and was selected in the eighth round of the 1983 NFL draft. He played with the Dolphins until 1992, earning five Pro Bowl and three second-team All-Pro selections. He finished his career playing one season with the Green Bay Packers in 1993.

==Early life==
Clayton attended the University of Louisville, where he played wide receiver from 1979 to 1982. His best season was as a senior, when he made 53 catches for 1,112 yards and six touchdowns.

==Career==
Clayton started his career in 1983 on the bench, appearing sporadically on offense but working as the team&#x27;s primary punt returner. For the season he had six catches for 114 yards and one touchdown, while returning 60 punts for 392 yards and a touchdown. His first highlight game came on October 9 against the Buffalo Bills in a 38–35 loss; he had his first touchdown come through the air: in the third quarter, he threw a pass to Mark Duper that went 48 yards for a touchdown. In the following quarter, he would catch a 14-yard pass from Dan Marino for his first receiving touchdown.

He became a star in 1984. Playing in 15 games, he caught 73 passes for 1,389 yards for a league leading 18 touchdowns while garnering his first selection to the Pro Bowl. He made his first playoff appearance that year as the Dolphins coasted to a 14–2 record. His performance in Week 16 against the Dallas Cowboys earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. He caught just four passes for 150 yards, but three were for touchdowns, including the game winner in the fourth quarter. His eighteen touchdowns were the most by a receiver in one season until it was surpassed in 1987 by Jerry Rice; Clayton&#x27;s 1984 mark is still tied for the third highest total in NFL history. In the Divisional Round game against the Seattle Seahawks, he caught five passes for 75 yards for a touchdown in the 31–10 win. The following week, he caught four passes for 95 yards and a score as they beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship 45–28. In Super Bowl XIX, facing the San Francisco 49ers, he caught six passes for 92 yards, but the Dolphins failed to solve the stifling defense of the San Francisco 49ers in the 38–16 loss. Although Clayton appeared in twelve postseason games for a career, he caught just one more touchdown pass after 1984 (doing so in the 1990 Divisional Round game against Kansas City).

The following year showed marked differences for Clayton. He caught 70 passes for 996 yards while scoring four times. His yards per game went from 92.6 the previous year to 62.3 (which was his lowest in a season until 1990). At any rate, he was selected to the Pro Bowl once again. This proved the case again for 1986, when he played in 15 games while catching 60 passes for 1,150 yards while scoring ten times. He experienced slowdown in the following, marred by playing just 12 games (as he was on strike from week 3 to 6). He caught 46 passes for 776 yards while scoring seven times. He renewed himself in 1988, having a Pro Bowl year with a career high 86 passes for 1,129 yards while scoring a league-leading 14 touchdowns.

He had another 1,000 yard season while playing 15 games in 1989, scoring nine times on 64 catches for 1,011 yards. He regressed to his lowest totals in 1990 by playing 10 games with 32 catches for 406 yards for three scores. He did have one more revival with the 1991 season, catching 70 passes for 1,053 yards while scoring 12 times for a fifth and final Pro Bowl selection. He ended his Miami career the next year, playing 13 games while catching 43 passes for 619 yards with three touchdowns. He moved to the Green Bay Packers for his final season in 1993 and played in 16 games. He caught 32 passes for 331 yards for three touchdowns.

Clayton finished his 11-year career with 582 receptions for 8,974 yards, along with 108 rushing yards, 40 kickoff return yards, and 485 punt return yards. He also scored 86 total touchdowns (84 receiving, one passing, and one punt return)

==Career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Legacy==
He is in the NFL top 50 in receiving yards (tied for 39th) and receiving TDs (tied for 13th). He holds Dolphins records for career pass receptions and TDs. A favorite target of Dan Marino, he paired with Mark Duper to form the popular &quot;Marks Brothers&quot;, and they would play together for 10 years. At one point in time, the Dan Marino-Mark Clayton tandem was the most prolific in NFL history.

He is one of only three players in the history of the NFL who has caught a touchdown pass from both Dan Marino and Brett Favre during the NFL regular season. The others are Keith Jackson and Mark Ingram.

In 2003, he entered the Miami Dolphins Ring of Honor, along with fellow &quot;Marks Brother&quot;, Mark Duper on December 15, 2003. On June 20, 2014, it was announced that Clayton would be inducted into the Kentucky Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2005, he helped punctuate Marino&#x27;s Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech by running through the crowd and catching one last pass from Marino thrown from the stage.

He now lives in Houston, Texas, with his sons Mark Gregory Clayton II and Matthew Clayton.

<text>Pen Hill forms part of the Mendip Hills plateau in Somerset, England. The hill is located in St Cuthbert Out civil parish.

The name Pen is believed to be Celtic for hill or tor. It gives its name to one of the four periclines which underlay the geology of the hills.

The summit is 305 metres (1,001 ft) above sea level and is marked by an Ordnance Survey trig point. It is the second highest point on the Mendip Hills. Pen Hill is home to the Mendip TV Mast which is 281 metres (922 ft) high. Pen Hill provides views in all directions, particularly to the south, with views to the City of Wells and Wells Cathedral (approximately distant). On clear day it is often possible to see across Somerset to the Blackdown Hills, Quantock Hills and Brendon Hills.

There are ancient remains on the hill, in the form of a neolithic Long barrow, which has been listed as Scheduled Ancient Monument, and a post medieval pillow mound thought to have been built specifically for rabbit breeding.

<doc id="1306437" wikidata="Q6767435" url="?curid=1306437" title="Mark Duper">
<text>Mark &quot;Super&quot; Duper (born January 25, 1959) is an American former football wide receiver who played for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) from 1982 to 1992. He played college football for the Northwestern State Demons and was selected by the Dolphins in the second round of the 1982 NFL draft. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection.

==Professional career==
Nicknamed &quot;Super Duper&quot;, he played 11 seasons for the Dolphins where his best years came while teamed with Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino and fellow wide receiver Mark Clayton, the other half of the &quot;Marks Brothers&quot; wide receiver tandem. Duper, who wore #85, was a 3-time Pro Bowl selection in 1983, 1984 and 1986. His best season was 1984, when he had 71 catches, 1306 yards and 8 touchdowns, and in 1986, when he tallied 67 catches, 1313 yards and 11 touchdowns. Duper had four 1,000-yard seasons, with the final one coming in 1991 at age 32, when he posted 1085 yards. In 1990, Duper became only the second Dolphins player to surpass 7,000 career receiving yards. On July 17, 1993, the Dolphins released Duper, after re-hauling their receiving corps bringing in O.J. McDuffie, Irving Fryar, and Mark Ingram Sr., and letting go of the Marks Brothers.

Duper was also a track star, he won in the finals of the 400-meter relay at the 1981 NCAA track and field championships at Northwestern State University, and from the 1980 Olympic trials finished seventh in the 200-meter dash and reached the semifinals of the 100. He competed in the 100 meters and 200 meters, posting personal bests of 10.21 seconds and 20.77 seconds, respectively.

In 11 NFL seasons, he caught 511 passes for 8,869 yards and 59 touchdowns. In 1994, he also appeared in two games with the Miami Hooters of the Arena Football League.

On November 8, 2013, Duper revealed he had been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Duper was inducted (with Mark Clayton) into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll on December 15, 2003.

<text>The mass media in Kazakhstan refers to mass media outlets based in Kazakhstan, a Central-Asian country that gained independence after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1991. The Constitution of Kazakhstan guarantees freedom of press, but privately owned and opposition media have been subject of censorship. In 2004 the International Federation of Journalists identified a &quot;growing pattern&quot; of intimidation of the media, and in 2012 several opposition media outlets were ordered to be shut down on charges of promoting &quot;extremism&quot;.

All media must register with the Ministry of Culture, Information and Sports, with the exception of websites.

==History of mass media and freedom of the press==
The media in Kazakhstan is &quot;dominated by state-owned and pro-government outlets. Most major outlets are controlled by the government directly or indirectly,&quot; according to the BBC. Opposition newspapers and magazines were either closed or forced abroad, under threat of being fined. The most popular medium is television, with the government running the national networks. Kazakhs have access to Russian television stations through cable and satellite; on the internet, Russian social media are the most popular.

Reporters Without Borders noted in 2024 that &quot;repressive reforms&quot; have since 1997 seriously limited the freedom of the press in Kazakhstan, and stated that &quot;the media landscape is now essentially a propaganda outlet for the Kazakh regime&quot;. More restrictions followed in 2022, after the 2022 Kazakh unrest. According to Reporters Without Borders, &quot;The government pays private media to disseminate its propaganda. The government controls the appointment of top editors at state-owned and state-controlled media. The Ministry of Information itself serves as a media regulator.&quot;

Kazakhstan was ranked 122nd out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders&#x27; Press Freedom Index for 2022; it ranked 155th for 2021. In 2023, it ranked 134rd, and in 2024 142nd.

==Newspapers and magazines==
A wide range of publications, mostly supportive of the government, are available. The authorities operates newspaper in Kazakh, and a regular national Russian-language newspaper. There were 990 privately owned newspapers and 418 privately owned magazines. Those supportive of the opposition face harassment and lawsuits.

Newspapers and magazines include:
*&quot;Kazakhstanskaya Pravda&quot; (state-run, in Russian), considered the official organ of the Council of Ministers
*&quot;Sovety Kazakstana&quot; (state-run, in Russian), the publication of the parliament
*&quot;Yegemen Qazaqstan&quot; (state-run)
*&quot;Ekspress-K&quot; (private, in Russian)
*&quot;Zhas Alash&quot; (private, opposition)
*&quot;Liter&quot; (private, daily)
*&quot;Vremya&quot; (private, in Russian)
*&quot;Karavan&quot; (private, weekly)

===Intimidation and government-ordered closures===
The opposition publication &quot;Respublika&quot; ran into serious difficulty after November 2001, when owners of printing presses refused to print the publication after a failed attempt by a government representative to buy a controlling stake in &quot;Respublika&quot;. (One owner found a human skull placed on his doorstep.)

The paper evaded a mid-March 2002 court order to stop printing for three months by printing under other titles, such as &quot;Not That Respublika&quot;. A decapitated dog was hung from &quot;Respublika&quot; building with a screwdriver sticking into its side and a note reading &quot;there will be no next time&quot;; the dog&#x27;s head was left outside Irina Petrushova&#x27;s home. Three days later, the newspaper&#x27;s offices were firebombed and burned to the ground. In July, Petrushova was given an eighteen-month jail sentence on tax charges, but served no time after a judge ruled that the case fell under an amnesty. (Petrushova eventually left the country for Russia, where she continued to publish via the Internet, living apart from her family for their safety. In recognition of her work, she was awarded a 2002 International Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists, a US-based NGO.)

In May 2005 the Kazakh Information Ministry ordered the paper to be closed, accusing it of inciting ethnic hatred by publishing an interview with a Russian politician who made derogatory remarks about ethnic Kazakhstanis. The paper&#x27;s deputy editor Galina Dyrdina claimed the closure was politically motivated, and vowed to appeal. The paper continued to be published under a variety of titles.

In November 2012, before the anniversary of the Mangystau riots, Kazakh authorities raided and searched Respublika&#x27;s office and again suspended its publication while a verdict on criminal charges was still pending. On 21 November, Prosecutors moved to ban Respublika including eight newspapers and 23 Internet sites under its umbrella, along with the Vzglyad newspaper and its Internet sites for &quot;propagating extremism&quot;. Reporters Without Borders described this as a &quot;pretext&quot; and said it would be the end of pluralism in Kazakhstan. A month later, the ban was ordered.

====A magazine and two other newspapers====
Other media experienced difficulties during the November 2012 case against media sources in Kazakhstan; &quot;Altyn Tamyr&quot;, &quot;Tortinshi Bilik&quot; and &quot;DAT&quot; (with its website—dat.kz—inaccessible as of December 2012).

====International reaction to assaults on journalists====
In 2012 the International Press Institute called for the government to investigate an assault on Ularbek Baitailaq—a contributor to opposition media &quot;DAT&quot; and &quot;Tortinshi Bilik&quot;, and archivist of the Kazakh National Archive). The Committee to Protect Journalists called for investigations into the assault of both Maksim Kartashov and Baitailaq.

==Television==

Qazaqstan is the State Television Channel of Kazakhstan. Other country-wide television stations are Khabar and Yel Arna.

Gakku TV and Toi Duman are music channels dedicated solely to only airing music produced in Kazakhstan.

There are 116 private channels, including Channel 31, KTK and Perviy Kanal Evraziya.

==Radio==
The state-owned Kazakh Radio broadcasts in official and Russian languages. A wide number of private radio stations are also available including Europa Plus, (Russian Radio), Hit FM, Radio Azattyq and Radio Karavan.

==Media websites==
The country had 5.4 million internet users in 2011—up from 2010. &quot;Twitter, Facebook and YouTube audience share is less than 0.4%&quot;, according to BBC in 2012.

The censorship of online publications has become routine and arbitrary.

In 2003 the state telecom firm KazakhTelecom was ordered to block access to a dozen websites it said were &#x27;extremist&#x27;. The pages either supported the opposition or provided neutral news coverage.

In July, 2009, the government passed amendments to laws on the Internet which some critics claimed unduly restrictive. The law made internet content subject to existing laws on expression, such as criminal libel. It also widened the scope of &#x27;banned media content&#x27; to cover political matters, such as coverage of the election campaign.

A broadcasting bill implemented in December 2011 was aimed at improving the content of the national media, and to &#x27;protect&#x27; it from external influence. According to the government, the bill would “eliminate low quality content that inflicts psychological or emotional damage on views.” 

The country had 5.4 million internet users and 362,000 Facebook users as of December 31, 2011.

==Lawsuits with governmental plaintiffs and defendants from media==
In November 2012, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LiveJournal were cited in a lawsuit filed by Kazakh prosecutors seeking to shut down opposition media outlets. The prosecutors demanded the websites stop publishing material from Kazakh opposition sources.

The following month a court in Almaty ruled that a number of opposition media outlets, such as the television channels Stan TV and K+ and newspapers Vzglyad and Respublika, had to close due to their &quot;extremist&quot; views. These were the same outlets who reported on the Mangystau riots in 2011.

===Punishment for defaming a news agency===
Increasingly, censorship is imposed by means of civil legal action, such as defamation suits. On 13 June 2005 a court in Almaty ordered former Information Minister Altynbek Sarsenbaev (the opposition leader assassinated in January 2006) to pay 1 million tenge ($7,500) in damages for &#x27;defaming&#x27; Khabar news agency. Sarsenbaev was also ordered to publicly retract comments he made in an interview with the opposition newspaper Respublika. He had alleged that Khabar was part of a monopolistic media holding controlled by Dariga Nazarbayev. The case is believed to be in response to his resignation after the 2004 elections. At the time he stated &quot;The election was not fair, honest, or transparent; the authorities showed that from the beginning they didn&#x27;t want honest elections.

==Media-related legal code==
Media watchdog groups such as ARTICLE 19 have voiced their concern over the government&#x27;s moves in the past few years to silence the opposition. Recent changes in media-related laws in Kazakhstan appear to target non-governmental media outlets. Criticism of government employees can lead to lawsuits, and news laws against &quot;extremism&quot; have been used to shut down opposition media sources.

According to opposition source Adil Soz the Kazakh legal code is stringent on defamation, allowing even for cases where the defamation is true. &quot;One can seek compensation for true statements damaging his/her reputation – for example, a government official who is of accused of abuse of State funds, can claim compensation even if the statement damaging his/her reputation is true&quot;. This also means that an Internet Service Provider could attract liability &quot;by unwittingly providing access to insulting or defamatory information published through the Internet&quot;.

<doc id="1306443" wikidata="Q1264147" url="?curid=1306443" title="New York Mutuals">
<text>The Mutual Base Ball Club of New York was an American baseball club established in 1857, the year of the first baseball convention. The Mutuals just missed out on being a founding member of the National Association of Base Ball Players that year, but later became a charter member of both the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, or &quot;NA&quot;, the first professional league, in 1871, and then the National League in 1876. 

The team was initially formed from firefighters of New York&#x27;s Mutual Hook and Ladder Company Number One. Boss Tweed took control of the Mutuals in 1864 and operated the team until his arrest following the deadly riots of 1871 and the public exposing of his corruption that followed. During Tweed&#x27;s tenure as owner, he and the Mutuals have been given credit for initiating the concept of spring training when Tweed sent the team to New Orleans to train for the 1869 season.

The Mutual club initially played its home games at Elysian Fields in Hoboken, with the New York Knickerbockers and many other Manhattan clubs, but moved to the enclosed Union Grounds in Brooklyn in 1868. Though historically identified as &quot;New York&quot;, they never staged any home games in Manhattan, which before 1898 was considered to be &quot;New York City.&quot;

The Mutuals chose open professionalism in 1869–70 after NABBP liberalization. They joined the NA for its 1871 to 1875 duration. In 1876, the Chicago White Stockings initiated the National League and recruited its members from West to East, partly to wrest control of professional baseball from Eastern interests. The Mutuals were one of eight charter members, six of whom were from the National Association. Weak (sixth place at 21–35) and cash-poor, the club refused to complete its playing obligations in the West; and was expelled.

On May 13, 1876, the Mutuals executed the first triple play in major-league history in a game against the Hartford Dark Blues.

Union Grounds proprietor William Cammeyer, often listed today as the Mutual club owner, signed the Hartford Dark Blues to play at his Union Grounds in 1877. The team was effectively a one-year replacement for the defunct Mutuals, and was sometimes called &quot;Hartford of Brooklyn&quot;.

<text>Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre is an open-air theatre in Regent&#x27;s Park in central London, established in 1932. Originally known for its Shakespearean productions, the theatre now features a wide variety of performances, including musicals, operas and plays simplified for children

==The theatre==
Established in 1932, Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre is one of the largest theatres in London, with 1,304 seats. It is situated in Queen Mary’s Gardens in Regent’s Park, one of London’s Royal Parks. The theatre’s annual 18-week season is attended by more than 140,000 people each year. In 2017, the theatre was named London Theatre of the Year in The Stage Awards, and received the Highly Commended Award for London Theatre of the Year in 2021.

Many famous people have performed at the theatre. One of the first was in 1936 when Vivien Leigh played Anne Boleyn in Henry VIII, three years before she found fame in Gone with the Wind. Subsequent actors and actresses include Anna Neagle, Eileen Atkins, Bernard Bresslaw, Jeremy Irons, Michael Gambon, Kate O’Mara, Lesley Garrett, Richard E. Grant, Ralph Fiennes, Hugh Bonneville, Damian Lewis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sheridan Smith. Judi Dench, who has had a long relationship with the theatre, is currently Patron.

== History ==
In 1932, the New Theatre (now the Noël Coward Theatre) was left without a show after the early closure of a play by Benito Mussolini. Producer Robert Atkins and theatre critic Sydney Carroll presented a ‘black and white’ production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; which subsequently transferred to a makeshift theatre in Regent&#x27;s Park, thus establishing Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre.

The first full season, in 1933, included a revival of the previous year’s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and the first of the theatre&#x27;s almost 50 productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night’s Dream.&quot; 

In 1939, Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre and the Windmill Theatre were the only two theatres to remain open throughout World War II.

In 1963, actors and directors David Conville and David William established the New Shakespeare Company as a non-profit distributing company with distinguished actor and director Laurence Olivier as one of the key investors. Conville remained associated with the theatre for 50 years and, following his death in 2018, artist Lee Simmons was commissioned to design a sculpture for the theatre grounds.

The theatre’s current fixed amphitheatre-style auditorium was constructed in 1974 and has had subsequent refurbishments.

The theatre’s first original musical, Bashville, was performed in 1983. Notable productions in the theatre’s history include a gala performance in 2002 for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee (attended by The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh).

In 2008, &quot;A Midsummer Night’s Dream&quot; &quot;re-imagined for everyone aged six and over&quot; was the first ‘re-imagined’ production at the venue especially created for children. This was followed by various subsequent ‘re-imagined’ titles including &quot;Macbeth&quot; (2010) &quot;Pericles&quot; (2011), and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (2017).

The New Shakespeare Company became Regents Park Theatre Ltd in 2010, in light of the move away from producing Shakespeare-only plays. In 2015, the theatre launched a digital archive to enable audiences to explore all of the productions across its history. The archive continues to be updated.

In 2018, the venue co-produced its first opera with English National Opera, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;. This partnership led to the 2019 production of Humperdinck’s &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; which included an ensemble of children from the Pimlico Musical Foundation.

In 2020, Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre was the first to open during the coronavirus pandemic with a socially distanced production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar: The Concert&quot;.

== Awards ==
†also for &quot;The Crucible&quot;

==Beyond the park==
Various Open Air Theatre productions have gone on to be presented beyond the theatre itself. The first overseas transfer was of the 1956 productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; when the theatre was invited to perform at the Baalbek Festival in Lebanon. In 2011, &quot;Crazy For You&quot; transferred to the West End’s Novello Theatre and, the following year, Sheader and director Liam Steel re-directed their 2010 production of &quot;Into The Woods&quot; in Central Park, New York for The Public Theater.

Productions that have toured the UK following seasons at the Open Air Theatre include: &quot;The Pirates of Penzance, High Society, To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; (also a month-long residency at the Barbican Centre), &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Running Wild&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

The most widely seen production from Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre is the 2016 production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. After a second sell-out season in 2017, the production played a limited engagement at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 2018 before transferring to the Barbican in 2019. The show then toured North America.

<text>Earnest Alexander Byner (born September 15, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the East Carolina Pirates. He is now the running backs coach of Out-of-Door Academy.

==Playing career==
=== East Carolina University (1980–1983) ===
Byner was a fullback at East Carolina University from 1980 to 1983 where he gained 2,049 yards on 378 carries. Byner was inducted into the East Carolina Hall of Fame in 1998. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

=== National Football League (1984–1997) ===
Byner was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the tenth round (280th pick overall) of the 1984 NFL draft. He played for the Browns (1984–1988; 1994–1995), Washington Redskins (1989–1993) and the Baltimore Ravens (1996–1997). He finished his 14-year NFL career ranked 16th on the NFL&#x27;s all-time rushing list with 8,261 yards on 2,095 carries, with 56 touchdowns. He also caught 512 passes for 4,605 yards and 15 touchdowns, returned 33 kickoffs for 576 yards, and scored a touchdown on a recovered fumble, totaling 13,442 all-purpose yards and 72 career scores. In addition to his #16 rushing yards ranking at the time of his retirement, Byner finished his career within the NFL&#x27;s top 50 all-time leaders in rushing attempts, rushing touchdowns, and total yards. Byner&#x27;s 512 receptions is tied for 13th most by halfback/fullback/running back in NFL history as of 2018.

A productive, reliable running back who could rush, block and catch the ball out of the backfield, Byner was a popular player in Cleveland. Paired with power runner Kevin Mack in the Brown backfield, the pair both gained over 1,000 yards in the 1985 season. Byner helped the Browns reach the AFC Championship game in both 1986 and 1987 seasons, meeting the Denver Broncos in both games.

In the 1987 AFC Championship game he was instrumental in a Browns comeback from a 21–3 deficit to place the Browns in position to win the game. With the score tied at 31 midway through the 4th quarter, the Broncos scored a go-ahead touchdown to make the score 38–31 with six minutes to play. In the ensuing Cleveland drive the Browns worked the ball down the field to reach the Denver 8 yard line with a little over a minute left in the game. On the next play Byner took the Kosar handoff to run off left tackle. Byner powered past the Bronco line and looked sure to score a game-tying touchdown when Bronco defensive back Jeremiah Castille managed to strip him of the ball. The play, now known simply as The Fumble, became the play for which Byner is best remembered. The fumble marred an otherwise impressive performance, as he finished the game with 67 rushing yards, seven receptions for 120 yards, and two touchdowns.

Byner played another season with Cleveland before being traded to the Washington Redskins for running back Mike Oliphant before the start of the 1989 season. In Super Bowl XXVI, in 1992, he caught a touchdown pass in the second quarter, and the Redskins won, giving him the NFL Championship he could not win with the Browns.

Byner was a Pro Bowl selection in 1990 when he ranked fourth in the NFL with 1,219 yards rushing and in 1991 when he ranked fifth in the NFL with 1,048 yards rushing. His time with the Redskins earned him a position as one of the franchise&#x27;s 70 Greatest Redskins.

==Coaching==
=== Baltimore Ravens ===
He worked in the Baltimore Ravens front office as the director of player development after retiring as a player. He was the first player to be inducted into the Ravens&#x27; Ring of Honor in 2000.

=== Washington Redskins ===
In January 2004, Byner was hired to be the running backs coach on Joe Gibbs&#x27; staff. He held the same position with the Redskins organization for four seasons.

=== Tennessee Titans ===
On March 10, 2008, Byner was officially announced as the running backs coach for the Tennessee Titans. He was replaced by the Titans on January 25, 2010, by former running backs coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kennedy Pola.

=== Jacksonville Jaguars ===
He was named the Jacksonville Jaguars running backs coach on February 4, 2010.

=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ===
He was named the Tampa Bay Buccaneers running backs coach on February 19, 2012, but was let go after the 2013 season when the head coach and GM were fired.

<text>The Almeida Theatre is a 325-seat producing house located on Almeida Street off Upper Street in the London Borough of Islington. The theatre opened in 1980, and produces a diverse range of drama. Successful plays are often transferred to West End theatres.

==Building==
The building that now houses the theatre was originally constructed in 1837 for the newly formed Islington Literary and Scientific Society. It included a library, reading room, museum, laboratory, and a lecture theatre seating 500. The architects were the fashionable partnership of Robert Lewis Roumieu and Alexander Dick Gough. The library was sold off in 1872 and the building was disposed of in 1874 to the Wellington Club (Almeida Street then being called Wellington Street) which occupied it until 1886. In 1885 the hall was used for concerts, balls, and public meetings. The Salvation Army bought the building in 1890, renaming it the Wellington Castle Barracks (Wellington Castle Citadel from 1902). To suit the building&#x27;s new purpose, the front-facing lecture hall&#x27;s tiered benches were replaced so that the congregation was seated in the conventional position, facing away from the front, and a balcony was added. The Salvationists remained there until 1955. For a few years from 1956 the building was a factory and showroom for &quot;Beck&#x27;s British Carnival Novelties&quot;, then remained empty until in 1972 a campaign began to turn it into a theatre.

The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage in 1972. The current modified building retains the listing.

==History==
===Foundation===
The campaign to open the building as a theatre was led by the Lebanese-born opera and theatre director Pierre Audi, after he had acquired the derelict building in 1972. A public appeal was launched and in 1980, with the building renovated, the theatre opened with a festival of avant-garde music and performance, held both there and at other Islington venues, with Audi as the Artistic Director. Under Audi the theatre&#x27;s reputation grew and its annual contemporary music festival became highly regarded.

===1980s===

The Almeida International Festival of Contemporary Music and Performance included concert presentations and productions of new and commissioned operas from Europe, Russia, North America, Japan, Argentina, and Morocco. Among the hundreds of composers, musicians and ensembles featured in frequent world and local premiere performances were Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Lou Harrison, Conlon Nancarrow, Morton Feldman, Elliott Carter, Virgil Thomson, Frederic Rzewski, Arvo Pärt, Alfred Schnittke, Wolfgang Rihm, Claude Vivier, Toru Takemitsu, Giacinto Scelsi, Michael Finnissy, Gerald Barry, Somei Satoh, Akio Suzuki, Takehisa Kosugi, Jo Kondo, Sylvano Bussotti, Luis de Pablo, Capricorn, Spectrum, Music Projects/London, Singcircle, the Arditti Quartet, and the London Sinfonietta.

Peter Greenaway&#x27;s 1983 series of films for Channel 4 &quot;Four American Composers&quot; featured Almeida presentations of works by John Cage, Robert Ashley and Philip Glass. In 1985 Ástor Piazzolla, the renowned Argentine tango composer and bandoneón player, made a week-long appearance with his Quinteto Nuevo Tango. For several years, the American pianist and composer Yvar Mikhashoff conceived and co-ordinated concert programming, including &quot;At the Tomb of Charles Ives: A Celebration of American Experimental Music 1905-1985&quot; which featured world and UK premieres of works by Cage, Nancarrow, Glass, Feldman, Harrison, Rzewski, Charles Ives, George Antheil, Henry Brant, Anthony Braxton, Carla Bley, Roger Reynolds, Charles Wuorinen, and Lukas Foss and two piano marathons he performed himself: &quot;The Great American Piano Marathon: 70 works from 70 years in 7 Hours&quot; and &quot;50 Tangos - 50 Composers - A Tango Marathon: Selections from the International Tango Collection&quot;.

The Almeida housed a producing company which commissioned and staged several theatre works and operas and was a London &quot;receiving house&quot; for Fringe, avant-garde, regional and international theatre productions. Touring companies from the UK were regularly hosted, including Complicité, Shared Experience, Joint Stock, Cheek by Jowl and the Leicester Haymarket, alongside international guest companies from the Philippines, Tibet, Israel, Ireland and Czechoslovakia. Stage directors of Almeida Theatre Company productions included Pierre Audi, Ian McDiarmid, Yuri Lyubimov, Tim Albery, Mike Bradwell, David Hayman, and Jean Jourdheuil. Works by directors Robert Wilson, Robert Lepage, Phelim McDermott, Julia Bardsley, Deborah Warner, Simon McBurney, Annabel Arden and several others were featured in Almeida presentations.

Peter Brook&#x27;s Bouffes du Nord company played there in 1982 (Brook&#x27;s company had been one of Audi&#x27;s original influences for the project). The 1985 Almeida Theatre Company production of &quot;The Possessed&quot;, a co-production with the Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe in Paris which also toured to the Piccolo Teatro in Milan and the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, was Russian director Yuri Lyubimov&#x27;s first to originate in the West after he defected in 1983 and featured music by Alfred Schnittke, design by Stefanos Lazaridis, and actors Nigel Terry, Clive Merrison, Harriet Walter, and Michael Feast. Ronald Harwood&#x27;s documentary drama, &quot;The Deliberate Death of a Polish Priest&quot; premiered at the Almeida in October 1985, an early example of a transcript of a trial of the political murderers of Father Jerzy Popiełuszko. In 1987, the Almeida also became home to Motley Theatre Design Course, under the directorship of Margaret Harris.

The Not the RSC Festival was presented at the Almeida in 1986 and 1987.

===1990s===
In 1990 the Scot Ian McDiarmid and the South African Jonathan Kent took over as joint artistic directors.

Work by major playwrights, old and new, British and foreign was staged and the theatre acquired an artistic reputation comparable to the leading theatres in central London. According to playwright David Hare, &quot;it reinvented the European repertoire for London audiences and made British theatre more cosmopolitan and outward going&quot;. Organised as a non-profit producing theatre, its productions regularly played to packed houses and frequently (14 productions between 1990 and 2002) transferred to London&#x27;s West End and to New York&#x27;s Broadway.

In 1993 the theatre won the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre.

One of the keys to the success and reputation of the Almeida during the 1990s were the stagings of various plays by Harold Pinter. These included revivals of &quot;Betrayal&quot; in 1991 and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; in 1992 and premières of &quot;Party Time&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Moonlight&quot; in 1993.

During their time at the theatre, McDiarmid and Kent were described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;[making] Islington a centre of enlightened internationalism&quot;; and, as they were about to leave their positions in 2002, Michael Billington, in same newspaper, summed up their achievements as threefold:
===1999 to present===
In November 1999, the Almeida was awarded £1.5 million by the Arts Council of England to undertake essential repairs to the theatre. The work began early in 2001 when the theatre was closed, and the company moved temporarily to a converted bus station at King&#x27;s Cross. National Lottery backing of £5.8 million allowed for a complete restoration designed by Burrell Foley Fischer.

The restoration included rebuilding and extending the foyer, installing more comfortable seating and access, plus better backstage facilities with the stage area re-built for flexibility and strength, the roof improved and insulated, the lighting grid strengthened, complete re-wiring, and technical equipment updated. Michael Attenborough took over as artistic director in 2002 and, following the completion of its restoration, the theatre was re-opened in May 2003 with a production of Ibsen&#x27;s The Lady from the Sea, directed by Trevor Nunn. The theatre&#x27;s artistic remit was the presentation of bold and adventurous play choices staged to the highest possible standards, in productions which revealed them in a new light. This included classics from the British, American and Irish repertoire, foreign classics in newly commissioned versions, and new plays. In October 2012 Attenborough announced that he would step down early in 2013.

Rupert Goold was appointed Artistic Director in February 2013, taking up the post full-time in September 2013. His association with the Almeida Theatre Company began in 2008 when he directed Stephen Adly Guirgis&#x27; &quot;The Last Days of Judas Iscariot&quot;. In 2013 his Headlong theatre company co-produced the premiere of Lucy Kirkwood&#x27;s &quot;Chimerica&quot;, directed by Lyndsey Turner, at the Almeida: the show subsequently transferred to the West End, winning five Olivier Awards in 2014. Goold&#x27;s first Almeida production as full-time artistic director was the world premiere production of &quot;American Psycho: A new musical thriller&quot; (initially programmed by Michael Attenborough), which ran from 3 December 2013 to 1 February 2014. In 2014 he directed the premiere of Mike Bartlett&#x27;s play &quot;King Charles III&quot;, which, following its sold-out run at the Almeida, transferred to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre and Broadway.

== Almeida Projects ==
Almeida Projects is the Almeida Theatre&#x27;s education and community programme. It was founded in its current form in 2003 by Rebecca Manson Jones, after Michael Attenborough&#x27;s appointment as artistic director. Almeida Projects activity includes durational residencies with partner schools, a subsidised ticket scheme for school groups visiting the theatre, productions of new plays for young people inspired by the main programme, the Young Friends of the Almeida scheme, social networking Teachers&#x27; Evenings for local performing arts teachers and a training programme for workshop leaders.

Almeida Projects works closely with nine partner schools in Islington: Central Foundation Boys&#x27; School, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School, Highbury Fields School, Highbury Grove School, Islington Arts and Media School, Mount Carmel Catholic College for Girls, The Bridge School and City and Islington College. The Young Friends of the Almeida Theatre scheme was established in May 2008 to enable local young people to take part in activities outside of school. It currently has over 700 members and includes the Young Friends of the Almeida Creative Board, composed of young people who take an active role in planning and promoting all Young Friends activities.

== Digital Theatre ==
The Almeida was one of the launch theatres for Digital Theatre, a project which makes theatre productions available in video download form. The first performance that was filmed was &#x27;Parlour Song&#x27;.

<text>William Clay Matthews Jr. (born March 15, 1956) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for the Cleveland Browns and the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected in the first round of the 1978 NFL draft by the Browns and played in 278 games over 19 NFL seasons, which initially ranked him at number 17 among most games played (currently at number 21, see List of NFL players by games played). Matthews had 1,561 tackles in his career, unofficially the third most in NFL history trailing Jessie Tuggle and Ray Lewis.

Matthews is the father of Clay Matthews III, an All-Pro linebacker and Super Bowl Champion, and Casey Matthews, a former American football linebacker; brother of Hall of Fame offensive lineman Bruce Matthews.

== Early life and college ==
Matthews was born into a football family. His father, Clay Matthews Sr., played for the NFL in the 1950s. Matthews graduated from New Trier East High School in Winnetka, Illinois, in 1974. He and his younger brother, Bruce, both attended college at the University of Southern California, where both played on the USC Trojans football team.

== Professional career ==
Matthews was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 12th pick in the first round of the 1978 NFL draft. He was a four-time selection for the Pro Bowl with the Browns and was a cornerstone of the defense for well over a decade. In 1984, Matthews recorded 12.0 sacks. He was present at some infamous Browns playoff losses during the 1980s, known as Red Right 88 (1981), The Drive (1987), and The Fumble (1988), which stopped those Browns teams from potentially advancing to the Super Bowl. One of his most memorable moments as a Brown was in a playoff game against the Bills on January 6, 1990. With only seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Bills at the Browns&#x27; 11-yard line, Matthews intercepted a pass (at the one-yard line) thrown by Bills quarterback Jim Kelly to seal a Cleveland victory. After the 1993 season, Matthews signed with the Atlanta Falcons. In 1995, at the age of 39, Matthews started all 16 games for the Falcons and set a record as the oldest player to record a sack at the age of 40 years, 282 days.

Matthews was named the AFC Defensive Player of the Week twice on the Cleveland Browns (Week 12, 1984 and Week 9, 1991). Matthews and his son, Clay III, are the only father-son tandem to be named Defensive Player of the Week in the NFL.

In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Matthews to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.

==Life after pro football==
Matthews resides in Agoura Hills, California. He serves as defensive coordinator at Oaks Christian High School, a co-ed private school in Westlake Village, California which his son Casey attended. Matthews was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 2005, along with his brother Bruce. Matthews also opened a Pontiac car dealership in the Cleveland suburb of Euclid in 1992; it currently operates under new ownership as Sims Buick GMC.

Matthews and his brother Bruce competed with members of their family on the popular TV game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;, hosted by Richard Dawson. The Matthews family won the game, with Matthews being one of two family members to play in the final round. They ended the game with 41 points total but did not take the $10,000 grand prize.

In 2014, Matthews was named Director of Football Operations at Carter High School (Tennessee), where he once served as an assistant coach.

==Personal life==

Matthews is married to Leslie Matthews. They have five children: Jennifer, Kyle, Brian, Clay III, and Casey. Clay III and Kyle played football at USC, while Casey was a linebacker for the Oregon Ducks football at the University of Oregon. Clay III was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 2009 NFL draft, while Casey was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2011 NFL draft.

<text>Altötting (, , in contrast to &quot;New Ötting&quot;; , ) is a town in Bavaria, capital of the district Altötting of Germany. For 500 years it has been the scene of religious pilgrimages by Catholics in honor of Mary, including a visit by Pope John Paul II in 1980 and one by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006.

==History==
During the Carolingian period, there was a royal palace here. Nearby, King Carloman erected a Benedictine monastery in 876, with Werinolf as first abbot, and also built the abbey church in honour of the Apostle St. Philip. In 907 King Louis the Child gave the abbey &quot;in commendam&quot; to Burchard, the Bishop of Passau (903-915), (probably identical with Burchard, second and last abbot). In 910 the Hungarians ransacked and burnt the church and abbey.

In 1228 Duke Louis I, Duke of Bavaria rebuilt these buildings and, after they were sanctified, placed them in charge of twelve Canons Regular, headed by a provost. The canons remained until the secularization of the Bavarian monasteries in 1803.

Saint Conrad of Parzham, O.F.M. Cap., (1818–1894) served as porter at the Friary of St. Ann in the city of Altötting for 40 years.

==Grace Chapel==
This small town is famous for the &quot;Gnadenkapelle&quot; (Chapel of Grace), one of the most-visited shrines in Germany. This is a tiny octagonal chapel which keeps a venerated statue of the Virgin Mary. According to the legend, in 1489, a 3-year-old local boy who had drowned in the river was revived when his grieving mother placed him in front of a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary at the high altar. News of the miracle quickly spread, and the chapel was immediately extended by the erection of a nave and a covered walkway.

In the Treasure Vault of the Holy Chapel of Altötting is the Golden Horse, or &quot;Goldenes Rössli&quot;, a 62 cm-high altarpiece made of gold and gilded silver, with golden figures coated with different coloured enamel. It depicts the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child, and, as children, John the Baptist, John the evangelist and St. Catherine. In the foreground is King Charles VI of France. This masterpiece of the goldsmith&#x27;s craft was a gift from Isabeau, Queen of France, a member of the Wittelsbach Bavarian royal family.
The tradition of Bavaria calls for the heart of the deceased king to be placed in an urn and kept at the chapel at Altötting. The heart of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, the builder of Neuschwanstein castle, lies in this chapel, along with those of his grandfathers and father.

==Sights==
Other architectural highlights in the town are the twin-towered &quot;Stiftskirche&quot;, a late Gothic church erected in the early years of the 16th century in order to cater for the growing affluence of pilgrims, and the huge Neo-baroque &quot;Basilika&quot;, built at the beginning of the 20th century.

<doc id="1306473" wikidata="Q5296262" url="?curid=1306473" title="Donmar Warehouse">
<text>The Donmar Warehouse is a 251-seat, not-for-profit Off-West End theatre in Covent Garden, London, England. It first opened on 18 July 1977.

Sam Mendes, Michael Grandage, Josie Rourke and Michael Longhurst have all served as artistic director, a post held since March 2024 by Tim Sheader. The theatre produces new writing, contemporary reappraisals of European classics, British and American drama and small-scale musical theatre.

As well as presenting at least six productions a year at its home in Covent Garden, as well transferring shows to the West End, Broadway and elsewhere.

==History==
Theatrical producer Donald Albery formed Donmar Productions around 1953, with the name derived from the first three letters of his name and the first three letters of his friend, ballerina Margot Fonteyn. In 1961, he bought the warehouse, a building that in the 1870s had been a vat room and hops warehouse for the local brewery in Covent Garden, and in the 1920s had been used as a film studio and then the Covent Garden Market banana-ripening depot. His son Ian Albery, a producer and theatre design consultant, converted the warehouse into a private rehearsal studio.

In 1977, the Royal Shakespeare Company acquired it as a theatre and renamed it Warehouse, converting and equipping at &quot;immense speed&quot;. The first show, which opened on 18 July 1977, was &quot;Schweik in the Second World War&quot;, directed by Howard Davies, which transferred from the Other Place in Stratford. The electricity for the theatre was turned on just 30 minutes before curtain up, and the concrete steps up to the theatre were still wet.

The Warehouse was an RSC workshop as much as a showcase and the seasons included Trevor Nunn&#x27;s Stratford 1976 &quot;Macbeth&quot;, starring Judi Dench and Ian McKellen, which opened at the Covent Garden venue in September 1977 before transferring to the Young Vic. The RSC went on to stage numerous productions, both original and transfers from The Other Place, Stratford. In 1980 nearly all the RSC company were involved in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; so a new two hander was found from the pile of submitted scripts. &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, with Julie Walters and Mark Kingston directed by Mike Ockrent, went on to be one of the RSC&#x27;s biggest successes.

From 1983 to 1989 it came under the artistic directorship of Nica Burns.

===Under Sam Mendes (1992–2002)===
The Donmar became an independent producing house in 1992 with Sam Mendes as artistic director. His opening production was Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Assassins&quot;. He followed this with a series of classic revivals.

Among Mendes&#x27; productions were John Kander and Fred Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot;, Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot;, Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; and his farewell duo of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, which transferred to the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Under Mendes, Matthew Warchus&#x27;s production of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;True West&quot;, Katie Mitchell&#x27;s of Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot;, David Leveaux&#x27;s of Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot; and Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot; were all productions at Donmar. Mendes&#x27; successor Michael Grandage directed some of the key productions of the later part of Mendes&#x27; tenure, including Peter Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Passion Play&quot; and &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; and Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;.

===Under Michael Grandage (2002–2011)===
In 2002 Michael Grandage succeeded Sam Mendes as Artistic Director. Grandage appointed Douglas Hodge and Jamie Lloyd as Associate Directors; in 2007 Rob Ashford succeeded Hodge.

For its revivals of foreign plays, the company regularly commissioned new translations or versions, including Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; (David Eldridge), Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phaedra&quot; (Frank McGuinness), Dario Fo&#x27;s &quot;Accidental Death of an Anarchist&quot; (Simon Nye) and Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Creditors&quot; (David Greig).

Its musical productions included &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; and the Stephen Sondheim works, &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot; and the 1992 production of &quot;Assassins&quot; that opened Sam Mendes&#x27; tenure as Artistic Director.

Under the umbrella of Warehouse Productions, the theatre sometimes opened shows in the West End. Including 1999&#x27;s &quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

Many well-known actors have appeared at the theatre, including Nicole Kidman (&quot;The Blue Room&quot;), Gwyneth Paltrow (&quot;Proof&quot;), Ian McKellen (&quot;The Cut&quot;) and Ewan McGregor (&quot;Othello&quot;).

With only 250 seats, the tickets for &quot;Othello&quot; starring McGregor were in such demand that Grandage feared it could become &quot;a bad news story&quot;. His response was to plan a one-year season at the 750-seat Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, four major new productions presented by Donmar West End. It commenced on 12 September 2008, with Kenneth Branagh in the title role of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot;, given in a new version by Tom Stoppard and directed by Grandage. The West End season continued with Derek Jacobi in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Judi Dench in Yukio Mishima&#x27;s &quot;Madame de Sade&quot; and Jude Law in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, all directed by Grandage.

Following the Donmar West End season, the Donmar held three productions internationally: transfers of &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Piaf&quot; and &quot;Creditors&quot;, to Broadway, Madrid and the Brooklyn Academy of Music respectively. Furthermore, from 30 September through December, the Donmar had the first of three year resident spots at Trafalgar Studios 2, in order to showcase its past Resident Assistant Directors.

In February 2011, the Donmar collaborated with the National Theatre Live programme to broadcast its production of &quot;King Lear&quot;, starring Derek Jacobi, to cinemas around the world. With over 350 screens in 20 countries, this single performance of &quot;King Lear&quot; was seen by more than 30,000 people.

===Under Josie Rourke (2012–2019)===

In January 2012, Josie Rourke became the third Artistic Director in the Donmar&#x27;s history. The first production under her leadership was George Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;, which Rourke also directed. Her first season also included Robert Holman&#x27;s 1987 play, &quot;Making Noise Quietly&quot;, directed by Peter Gill; Jack Thorne&#x27;s new version of &quot;The Physicists&quot; by Swiss playwright Friedrich Duerrenmatt; Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot;, directed by Lyndsey Turner; and Rourke&#x27;s own production of Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Berenice&quot;, in a new translation by Alan Hollinghurst and Phyllida Lloyd&#x27;s all female Julius Caesar, which later went on to play at the St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse, New York.

The Donmar built a temporary, in-the-round, 420-seat theatre next to King&#x27;s Cross station. This theatre housed the all-female Shakespeare trilogy: The Tempest, Julius Caesar and Henry IV, directed by Phyllida Lloyd, from September to December 2016.

=== Under Michael Longhurst (2019–2024) ===
In June 2018, Michael Longhurst was named the fourth Artistic Director of the Donmar Warehouse. Longhurst&#x27;s previous credits include &quot;Constellations&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre and &quot;Amadeus&quot; at the National Theatre.

Longhurst&#x27;s first season at the Donmar started on 20 June 2019 with David Greig’s &quot;Europe&quot;, followed by the UK premiere of &quot;Appropriate&quot; by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Further planned productions include &quot;[Blank]&quot; by Alice Birch, the UK premiere of Mike Lew&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Dick&quot; and the season closes with Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Far Away.&quot; He directed a revival of &quot;Constellations&quot; in the West End with four different casts. The theatre reopened in September 2021 and further productions included &quot;Henry V &quot;with Kit Harington&quot;, Macbeth&quot; with David Tennant and Cush Jumbo, and the musicals&quot; The Band&#x27;s Visit&quot; and&quot; Next to Normal.&quot;

In March 2024, Tim Sheader took over as artistic director

<text>Jeju National University of Education was the only teacher-training university on South Korea&#x27;s Jeju Island. It was located in the provincial capital, Jeju City. It merged with Cheju National University and its campus is used as Sara Campus of Cheju National University in 2008.

The first training program, begun in July 1946, was only 3 months in length, but following the end of the first session, on November 10 it was made a one-year program. The training program was expanded to three years in 1951. In 1953, the school was reorganized as Jeju Provincial Normal School (제주도립사범학교). From 1962 to 1968, it operated as the education department of Cheju National University. In 1984, following a reform in the national education law, the program was extended to four years in length. The college became a university in 1993. The graduate school was opened in 2000. It merged with Cheju National University again in 2008 as 1960s.

The South African operation consisted of an assault by 2 South African Infantry Battalion on two South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) base complexes, Chetequera and Dombondola, near to the then-South West Africa/Angola border; an assault by the elite 32 Battalion on SWAPO&#x27;s Omepepa-Namuidi-Henhombe base complex around 20 km east of Chetequera; and finally, the attack the operation is most known for — a controversial airborne assault by paratroopers on Cassinga, a refugee camp and SWAPO&#x27;s regional headquarters, 260 km inside Angola. The operation ended on 10 May 1978.

==Background==
Prime Minister John Vorster met his defence advisers in December 1977. They discussed the need to take stronger measures against SWAPO, moving from the defensive position of reacting to PLAN incursions into SWA/Namibia, to one where the SADF would conduct pre-emptive attacks on PLAN bases in Angola. All external operational plans would have to have the approval of the Prime Minister.

Early in 1978, planning had begun for Operation Bruilof which involved a combined mechanised infantry and airborne attack on SWAPO bases around the town of Chetequera, 25 km inside Angola. These plans were abandoned and were expanded into a new plan called Operation Reindeer. This new operation included plans to attack the Chetequera bases but added the more important objective of attacking the SWAPO headquarters at Cassinga. The date of the operation was set for the 4 May.

==Planning==
Operation Reindeer planning identified three targets:

===Target Alpha &quot;Moscow&quot;===

The target was the former copper mining town of Cassinga which was about 250 km inside Angola. Cassinga had been converted into a SWAPO operational HQ, training base and refugee transit camp for Southern Angola commanded by Commander Dimo Hamaambo. South African military intelligence believed that the base contained around 1,200 recruits. The base was surrounded by zigzag trenches and bunkers. The plan involved three stages, an aerial attack by SAAF fighter bombers, followed by a parachute drop led by Colonel Jan Breytenbach, and lastly the withdrawal of paratroops by helicopter. The objectives were to destroy the base, capture Commander Dimo Hamaambo, destroy supplies and equipment, gather intelligence and take prisoners. The last objective was to free POW Sapper Johan van der Mescht.

===Target Bravo &quot;Vietnam&quot;===

This plan was for the attack by the SADF on six bases at Chetequera which included a SWAPO forward HQ for Western Ovamboland and supply base. Intelligence believed that these bases had a combined total of between 900 and 1000 PLAN insurgents. These bases were heavily defended by trenches and bunkers and contained weapons such as recoilless guns, RPG-7, 82mm mortars and 14.5mm AA guns. The plan involved an attack by mechanised Battle Group Juliet of SADF troops of national servicemen and permanent force soldiers commanded by Commandant Frank Bestbier. A further two independent combat teams would attack the southernmost bases. The plan ended with a withdrawal back over the border.

===Target Charlie===

The plan involved an attack on the smaller bases and suspected bases east of Chetequera. The attacked would be carried out by five rifle companies of the 32 Battalion supported by air and artillery units. The commander would be Commandant Deon Ferreira.

==SADF Order of Battle==

The following SADF units took part on the following targets:

===Cassinga===

Composite Parachute Battalion
*Made up of elements from 1, 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions
9 Rifle Platoon&lt;br&gt;
11 Rifle Platoon&lt;br&gt;
2 Hawk Groups from 1 Parachute Battalion

===Chetequera and Dombondola===
1 South African Infantry Battalion
*Combat Group Juliet (assault on Chetequera)
*Combat Group Joubert (assault on Dombondola)
*Combat Group Serfontein (assault on Dombondola)

===Omepepa-Namuidi-Henhombe===
32 Battalion
* 5 rifle companies
* 81mm mortar platoon
* 140mm artillery troop
* Helicopter gunships

==Battles==

===Cassinga===
===Chetequera and Dombondola===
The plan called for Combat Team Juliet to attack the Chetequera base from the north while Combat Teams Joubert and Serfontein would cross the border and attack the bases around Dombondola from the south. Juliet crossed the border around 10 am on 4 May in the new Ratels. They headed east past Dombondola to assemble north of Chetequera but arrived 90 minutes late due to the condition of the Angolan bush and road tracks. This delayed the air attack by the SAAF which began around 13h30 with Canberras and Buccaneers bombing the base. Due to radio delays between Combat Team Juliet&#x27;s forward air controller, the attack by ground forces started late giving PLAN time to prepare. Thick bush and maize fields interrupted the effectiveness of the mechanised infantry and individual units found themselves fighting on their own at close quarters in the trenches with rifles and grenades. The initial assault lasted only 11 minutes before all the units were able to reassemble and at which point it was realised that part of the base had been missed. The base was attacked again and by 15:30 pm fighting ceased, with the remaining PLAN forces either killed, surrendered or having escaped into the bush. It was recorded that 248 PLAN member had been killed and 200 captured while CG Juliet lost 2 men and had 10 wounded. Due to the delay in the start of the operation, Juliet spent the night in defensive positions in the Angolan bush and returned to the SWA border the next day.

Due to the heavy fighting at Chetequera, the SADF decided to use artillery to bombard the PLAN bases at Chatu and Dombondola 1 &amp; 2. The two combat groups then crossed the border and headed for their respective targets. Combat Group Joubert headed off late and then got lost, arriving at the base from the wrong direction and used a swing manoeuvre with the assistance of a planned artillery bombardment, which never materialised, to attack the Chatu base. The attack lasted 30 minutes and concluded with its capture and the seizure of weapons. CG Joubert spent the night in defensive positions and returned the next day to SWA by 10 am with CG Juliet.

Combat Group Serfontein was to assist CG Joubert if required. This was not necessary and so attacked its objective of Dombondola 2. The base was found to be deserted and was destroyed and weapons captured. Serfontein was then ready to attack its next objective but the missions were cancelled and the group returned to SWA.

===Omepepa-Namuidi-Henhombe===
The operation to attack the smaller SWAPO bases just north of the SWA border began on the morning of 6 May 1978. Three 32 Battalion companies advanced on the first target, with one company protecting the artillery troop while the fifth company was held in reserve. On lining up to attack the first target, artillery fire was called in to soften up the target. Due to an error in the calibration of the artillery pieces, the 32 Battalion units were shelled by their own side resulting in one death and eighteen wounded. The SA forces retreated south of their intended target to evacuate their wounded and the first target was attacked the next day after the artillery troop had moved forward. By the 8th of May, SAAF helicopters were added to the attack plan and 32 Battalion troops were airlifted from one target to another with five SWAPO bases attacked that day. On the 9th of May, the operation resumed without air support with bases being attacked throughout the day. 10 May was followed by further attacks on bases with several being empty of any enemy forces resulting in some of the 32 Battalion units being returned to the edge of the border. Though the operation officially ended on the 10th of May, the last base was attacked in the early morning of 11 May with all SADF forces back over the border by 10h00.

==Aftermath==
On the 25 April, several days before the beginning of Operation Reindeer, the South African government had agreed to the Western nations proposal of a settlement in SWA/Namibia though these proposals had not been accepted by SWAPO. At the same time, the UN General Assembly had begun a 10-day session to discuss South Africa&#x27;s control of South West Africa which ended on the day before the raid on the 4th of May. The Angolan news agency was the first to report a raid on a refugee camp at Cassinga, on the same day it occurred and this made international news that evening. During that day Radio Moscow was reporting a raid on a refugee camp and by that evening a special session of the UN Security Council was convened at the request of Angola. Sam Nujoma, SWAPO&#x27;s leader, addressed the council calling for a full economic, oil and arms embargo of South Africa and resulted in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 428. By 8 May, SWAPO and its leader Sam Nujoma had left the talks in New York due to a belief that negotiations for a settlement to the SWA/Namibia question would serve no purpose at this stage. 

SWAPO and the Angola government put their estimations of the number of casualties in a range between 582 and 624 people. South Africa claimed to have killed 1000 PLAN combatants with 200 captured. SADF&#x27;s own casualties for Operation Reindeer were presented as 7 dead and 39 wounded.

<text>The Downeaster is a passenger train service operated by Amtrak and managed by the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority (NNEPRA), an agency of the state of Maine. Named for the Down East region of Maine, the train operates five daily round trips between North Station in Boston, Massachusetts, and Brunswick, Maine, with ten intermediate stops.

In fiscal 2024, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; carried 598,426 passengers, up 27.0% from the previous year. In 2024, the train earned ticket revenue of 13,051,548 up from 10,420,681 the year prior, for a farebox recovery of 50%.

== History ==
=== Previous service ===
The &quot;Downeaster&quot; follows the route historically used by the &quot;Pine Tree&quot; and &quot;Flying Yankee&quot; trains that traveled from Bangor to Boston and were operated jointly by the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and Maine Central Railroad. Passenger operations between Portland and Boston ceased in 1965.

=== Service resumption ===

In 1989, a group of volunteers founded TrainRiders/Northeast, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing modern passenger rail service to Northern New England.

In 1990, at the urging of Maine&#x27;s congressional delegation, Amtrak estimated the cost of creating passenger rail service at about $50 million: $30 million for infrastructure improvements and another $20 million for equipment.

The following year, Amtrak agreed to provide the equipment at no charge to the State of Maine. Earlier in that same year, the Maine Legislature adopted its first citizen-initiated bill, the &quot;Passenger Rail Service Act&quot;, which was endorsed by the Maine DOT and signed by the governor. In 1992, Maine voters approved a $5.4 million rail bond for right-of-way improvements, and $60,000 was granted to the Maine DOT to design a Portland intermodal terminal. Later that year, Congress approved $25.5 million for more right-of-way improvements, and 1993 saw an additional $9.5 million in track improvements. By the end of 1994, total appropriations for infrastructure had reached $38.6 million.

In 1995, Governor Angus King and Commissioner of Transportation John Melrose ordered the creation of a passenger rail authority. TrainRiders/Northeast, led by Chairman Wayne Davis, worked with the state Chamber of Commerce and industry, Maine DOT, and others to convince the legislature to create the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority in August.

Service was initially expected to start in the 1990s. Negotiations between NNEPRA, Amtrak, and Guilford Industries (now Pan Am Railways) began in 1996, but began to fail over many factors, including equipment weight and speed limits. In December 1998, a speed limit of was agreed upon; the following year, the Federal Surface Transportation Board approved a limit of . Most right-of-way improvements were complete in 2000, but the following year, start-up was delayed again when Guilford refused to allow Amtrak to test track modulus or run trains faster than . The &quot;Downeaster&quot; made its first run on December 15, 2001.

=== Service improvements ===
In August 2007, top speeds were increased from to , cutting 20 minutes from trips between Portland and Boston. The first expansion of &quot;Downeaster&quot; service came that month, when the improvements made it possible to increase from four to five daily round trips from Portland to Boston. Amtrak plans to eventually add one or two round trips between Portland and Boston, bringing the daily total to six or seven. In 2009, NNEPRA unsuccessfully applied for federal stimulus money to increase train speeds—enough to cut 10 to 12 minutes off travel time—and increase the number of daily round trips from five to seven.

In 2011, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; became the first Amtrak train to offer free Wi-Fi service and e-ticketing.

In May 2014, NNEPRA agreed to add a station stop in Kennebunk, Maine. Like , it would have been a seasonal stop, open from April to October. Initial plans called for a temporary platform to be erected in 2016, with a permanent platform constructed with $300,000 in town money and $800,000 in state money for 2017 or 2018. Part of the former Boston &amp; Maine depot building, used for passenger service from 1873 to 1965, was to be leased for use as a waiting area. On October 9, 2018, the Kennebunk Board of Selectmen cancelled the station project over concerns about the suitability of the site. In November 2021 it was announced a stop in Kennebunk was back on the table, although not likely a priority ahead of other expansions and improvements.

In 2019, NNEPRA officials began looking into moving the Portland station. The Portland Transportation Center is on a branch line, which adds 15 minutes to travel time for trains to or from Brunswick. Other concerns with the current station include limited parking and its location on Thompson&#x27;s Point. A new location could put the station on the main line, move it closer to downtown, and improve vehicular and pedestrian access. In 2021, a MaineDOT study endorsed moving the station to a location near the original location of Portland&#x27;s Union Station.

NNERPA plans to extend an existing siding in Wells by , which will allow an additional daily Brunswick-Wells round trip. Wells station will get a second platform and a footbridge. In February 2020, NNERPA was awarded a $16.9 million federal grant for the project.

In July 2019, local officials proposed an infill station in West Falmouth next to a Maine Turnpike exit.

==== High-speed rail ====
In October 2000, the Federal Railroad Administration designated a route from Boston to Portland and Auburn as one component of the Northern New England Corridor, a proposed high-speed rail project.

=== Brunswick extension ===

Service to Brunswick was originally intended to begin within five years of the &quot;Downeaster&quot;&#x27;s 2001 launch, but was delayed by lack of funding and other obstacles. Ground was broken in October 2008 for the Brunswick Maine Street Station, a retail development that included shops, condominiums, an inn, and office space. In January 2010, NNEPRA received a $35 million grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for track and signal upgrades for the Portland-Brunswick line. Pan Am Railways began work on the line in summer 2010, and on May 14, 2012, the platforms in Brunswick and Freeport were declared complete. Service began on November 1, 2012, with two daily services to and from Boston.
The extension to Brunswick led to the construction of an enclosed layover facility there, just west of the station; trains had previously been stored outdoors in Portland. The facility opened in November 2016, permitting a third daily Brunswick–Boston trip. NNEPRA announced plans for the facility in 2013, with construction slated to run from summer 2013 until late 2014, but local opposition delayed the project. Neighbors of the planned location demanded further environmental studies, saying they believe the facility would hurt nearby areas. State politicians became involved; Governor Paul LePage, concerned about job creation at Brunswick Landing, suggested alternate locations in eastern Brunswick. Several Democratic state legislators asked NNEPRA to build in an existing rail yard in South Portland, and to focus on the &quot;core product&quot; of Boston-Portland service instead. Legal challenges to the facility ended in January 2016.

In 2017 and 2018, NNEPRA constructed a passing track, the Royal Junction siding, on the single-track section of line between Portland and Brunswick to enable an increase from three to five daily round trips to Brunswick. The increase to five weekday round trips between Boston and Brunswick (with four Brunswick round trips and one Portland round trip on weekends) took place on November 12, 2018. All five weekend round trips began running to Brunswick on May 20, 2019.

=== 2015 winter and track work ===
The &quot;Downeaster&quot;″s ridership, finances, and performance suffered in the first half of 2015 because of an exceptionally brutal winter and a subsequent large-scale tie replacement project funded by the NNEPRA. During its fiscal year 2015 (July 2014 to June 2015), Amtrak cancelled 488, or 13 percent, of its scheduled &quot;Downeaster&quot; trains. The trains that ran saw an on-time percentage of 30%, less than half the national average of 71%; during the tie replacement, none ran on time in May and 8% in June. Ridership dropped 18.2% (nearly 100,000 fewer riders) from the previous fiscal year.

The &quot;Downeaster&quot; resumed its full schedule on August 1, 2015, following the completion of the track repairs. By December 2015, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; was up to a monthly on-time percentage of 86%, well above the national average.

===2020s ===
In April 2020, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; was suspended as part of Amtrak service reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic. A single round trip resumed between Boston and Brunswick on June 15, 2020. Service was increased to four daily round trips in July 2020; the full five round trips resumed on May 3, 2021. 

On June 24–27, 2021, &quot;Downeaster&quot; trains stopped at Falmouth Country Club to serve attendees of the Live and Work in Maine Open.

Design work for positive train control (PTC) over the section of the route between Haverhill and Brunswick was completed in March 2023. (The Boston–Haverhill section had PTC installed by the MBTA several years earlier.) In November 2023, Amtrak and CSX reached a construction agreement under which Amtrak will contribute over $50 million and CSX will perform the work. , the PTC installation is expected to be complete in 2026.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===

Most &quot;Downeaster&quot; trains consist of five cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are the Amfleet I series passenger cars built by the Budd Company in the mid-to-late 1970s. Most trains include an Amfleet club car which has a combination of Business Class seating with a Café (food service/lounge) and four Coach Class cars. Trains are pulled or pushed on the northbound end of the train by a GE Genesis diesel locomotive at speeds up to . A second GE Genesis or a Non-Powered Control Unit (a former EMD F40PH locomotive converted into a control car) runs on the southbound end of the train.

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Downeaster&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a food service area and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating.

=== Classes of service ===
All classes of service include complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, fold-out tray tables. Reservations are required on all trains, tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.
*Coach Class: 2x2 seating. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.
*Business Class: 2x1 seating with more legroom than coach. Passengers receive complimentary soft drinks. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis.

Some &quot;Downeaster&quot; trains carry volunteers, coordinated by Trainriders Northeast, to inform passengers about destinations, attractions, and transfers.

=== Ridership and finances ===
Between December 2001 through 2005, annual ridership ranged from 250,000 to 300,000 passengers. In fiscal year 2011, ridership topped 500,000 for the first time. Ridership dropped sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was back up to 516,723 in fiscal year 2023. Ridership was 598,426 in fiscal year 2024 – 4% higher than the previous record in 2019.

The line&#x27;s busiest station is North Station in Boston. Due in part to the route&#x27;s success, North Station was the 23rd busiest Amtrak station in the country in fiscal year 2018, and the fifth busiest in New England (behind South Station, , New Haven Union and Back Bay). The busiest station in Maine is the Portland Transportation Center, while is New Hampshire&#x27;s busiest.

As of 2013, operational costs were around $15 million annually, $5.6 million of which is covered by Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding, $8.1 million in revenues, and $1.8 million in operating subsidy from the State of Maine. 58% of the overall ridership travels to or from the state of Maine.

=== Economic impact ===
A 2008 study by the Chicago-based Center for Neighborhood Technology suggested that the Brunswick extension, combined with commercial developments along the &quot;Downeaster Corridor&quot;, could generate several billion dollars in construction investments plus $55 million annually in tax revenue for the state of Maine.

In 2013, the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority estimated that the &quot;Downeaster&quot; has an annual economic impact of $12 million from visitors to Maine, and directly or indirectly employs 200 people.

=== Route ===

The &quot;Downeaster&quot; uses the MBTA&#x27;s Lowell Line from Boston&#x27;s North Station to Wilmington, the Wildcat Branch to Wilmington Junction, and the Haverhill Line to the Massachusetts–New Hampshire state line. From there to just short of Brunswick, it uses CSX Transportation&#x27;s former Pan Am Railways Freight Main Line. The last mile of track in Brunswick is owned by MaineDOT. Lines south of Portland were once part of the Boston and Maine Railroad; the part south of Wilmington Junction was once the mainline and a branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, and the rest was the mainline of the B&amp;M. The line north of Portland to Brunswick was once part of the Maine Central Railroad.

If the &quot;Downeaster&quot; were to run solely on the Haverhill Line, it would conflict with the local commuter rail service on a largely single-tracked rail line, since the Amtrak train makes no stops between and . By using the Wildcat Branch to cross between the Lowell and Haverhill lines, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; can pass a Haverhill train. 

Passengers are generally prohibited from purchasing &quot;Downeaster&quot; tickets to ride between Woburn and Boston, a route served by MBTA commuter trains; this keeps seats free for longer-distance passengers. This restriction is lifted during MBTA service disruptions on the Lowell or Haverhill lines.

The &quot;Downeaster&quot; is separated from the rest of Amtrak&#x27;s system because there is no direct link between Boston&#x27;s train stations. &quot;Downeaster&quot; passengers continuing from Boston can ride six stops on the MBTA Orange Line to Amtrak&#x27;s Back Bay station, where they can make connections to Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor services to New York and points south, as well as the &quot;Lakeshore Limited&quot; to Chicago.

A proposed connection is strongly supported by U.S. Senator Ed Markey, former Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, and others who are pushing for the connection so the diesel engines that currently haul the &quot;Downeaster&quot; can be replaced by electrified ones.

=== Station stops ===
== Proposed extensions ==

=== Bangor ===
There have been various proposals to extend &quot;Downeaster&quot; service from Brunswick along the old Maine Central Railroad main line to Augusta, Waterville, and Bangor, which last saw passenger train service in 1961 at Bangor Union Station.

In April 2015, Representative Michelle Dunphy and nine cosponsors introduced a bill in the Maine House that would direct MaineDOT to study the feasibility and cost of extending passenger rail to Bangor. The bill &quot;died between houses&quot; when legislators declined to appropriate the $300,000 cost from the highway fund. Dunphy and eight cosponsors reintroduced the bill in February 2017, but it also died in committee.

In January 2021, Senator Joe Baldacci and seven cosponsors introduced a bill similar to Dunphy&#x27;s in the Maine Senate. This bill was passed unanimously through committee in May 2021, and in June 2021 was passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Janet Mills. The amended bill directs MaineDOT to study the propensity for new passenger rail or other transit between Portland and Bangor by January 1, 2023, but only if local municipalities provide 25% of the study&#x27;s cost.

In March 2021, Amtrak did not include the route to Bangor in its &quot;Amtrak Connects Us&quot; 15-year expansion vision. Local stakeholders stated that they had not signed off on the plan, and that the omission does not preclude future service.

In April 2023, the results of the studies ordered in 2021 were published. MaineDOT concluded that a rail extension was not feasible, citing high capital costs and projected operating subsidies and limited projected ridership. Augmenting existing intercity bus service along the proposed extension corridor was recommended instead. Some politicians, including Baldacci and Auburn mayor Jason Levesque, stated that they would continue to pursue a rail extension.

=== Lewiston–Auburn ===

In 1960, the Maine Central Railroad ended passenger train service between Portland and Lewiston–Auburn, Maine&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area. Two existing rail lines have been identified as candidates for restored service along the route: the private Pan Am Railways line (expected to merge with CSX) and the state-owned St. Lawrence and Atlantic line.

An August 2011 feasibility study by MaineDOT examined a Portland-to-Auburn service, which would take 40 minutes and consist of eight daily round trips. There would be a bus connection from Auburn to downtown Lewiston. The report estimated 30,000 to 46,000 riders per year, depending on the number of direct rides to Boston versus transfers. The construction costs were placed at $107 million to $234 million, with annual operating costs of $3.5 to $9.4 million and a farebox recovery ratio of 15 to 27%.

In April 2013, NNEPRA announced that a plan for revived Portland-Lewiston–Auburn passenger rail would be released later in the year. New infrastructure needed for the route was said to include a layover facility in Brunswick (built in 2016), of new passing track in Yarmouth (the Royal Junction Siding, built in 2018), a wye in Portland, and an island platform at Portland Transportation Center.

In December 2016, NNEPRA hired VHB and WSP to produce a propensity report for the extension. Released in May 2018, the report forecast daily ridership of 250 to 330 given four round-trip trains per day, and 700 to 1,900 given 12 to 20 round-trip trains. The lower estimate alone was said to position Lewiston–Auburn as the third-busiest station of the &quot;Downeaster&quot;.

In June 2021, the Maine Legislature passed a bill directing MaineDOT to conduct an &quot;economic evaluation study&quot; building on the 2018 study, positioning the project for new federal funding expected from the Biden agenda. The state required municipalities to fund 10% of the $200,000 cost. Lewiston officials approved $10,000, but Auburn&#x27;s city council refused, calling the project a &quot;money pit.&quot; Portland stepped in to cover the remaining cost.

&quot;Amtrak Connects Us&quot; 15-year expansion vision, released in March 2021, did not include the route to Lewiston–Auburn.

==== Bethel ====

MaineDOT&#x27;s 2011 study also looked into a longer extension beyond Auburn to Bethel, with intermediate stops in Auburn and South Paris. This option was estimated to draw 66,700 to 71,100 riders per year.

=== Rockland ===
Until April 1959, the Maine Central Railroad provided passenger service from Brunswick east to Rockland, Maine, via the 56-mile Rockland Branch. The State of Maine purchased the line in 1987. From 2003 to 2015, the Maine Eastern Railroad leased operation of the line, offering seasonal excursion service to Rockland. The route was popular with summer vacationers; Rockland station is within walking distance of Rockland Ferry Terminal, which serves Vinalhaven, North Haven, and Matinicus. The Canadian Pacific Railway took over operations in June 2020, but does not run passenger service.

In 2017, NNEPRA announced plans for a 2018 pilot program that would extend one weekend &quot;Downeaster&quot; round trip to Rockland between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Intermediate stops would be made in Bath, Wiscasset, and Newcastle. The proposed pilot was later pared to three weekends in summer 2018, before ultimately being cancelled when Amtrak failed to conduct a risk assessment in time. Plans for a summer 2019 pilot also fell through when time ran out to reach a contract with the Central Maine and Quebec Railway. In August 2019, local stakeholders inspected the route aboard an Amtrak track geometry car, looking toward a summer 2020 pilot. In August 2021, NNEPRA said that the extension project is on hold, though public support remains for it.

In March 2021, Amtrak included the extension to Rockland in its &quot;Amtrak Connects Us&quot; 15-year expansion vision, coinciding with the Biden administration&#x27;s push to pass an infrastructure bill. Amtrak&#x27;s map lists stops in Waldoboro and Thomaston, as well as those previously proposed in Bath, Wiscasset, and Newcastle.

Finger Lakes Railway proposed a private alternative to this extension in January 2022. Under the plan, their subsidiary Midcoast Rail Service would operate a rail shuttle to Rockland that would have timed transfers with the &quot;Downeaster&quot; in Brunswick. One daily round trip would run year-round, unlike in Amtrak&#x27;s seasonal proposal. Two daily round trips would run on summer weekends. On June 12, Finger Lakes exited its lease to operate the branch after the loss of its primary freight customer, rendering the line unprofitable to operate and again putting &quot;Downeaster&quot; expansion plans on hold. 

In January 2025, MaineDOT selected Maine Switching Services to operate their branch. The company&#x27;s proposal included plans for seasonal excursion service but not a &quot;Downeaster&quot; extension.

=== Westbrook ===
In 2019, developers of the Rock Row development in Westbrook were looking into a rail link to the city. The rail shuttle would connect Commercial Street in Portland with high-density developments at Thompson&#x27;s Point, Rock Row, and to other transit services, which would support private investments and reduce the growing congestion. A NNEPRA feasibility study estimated that it would cost about $100 million to establishing such a service—mostly infrastructure and rolling stock—and between $7 million and $13 million annually to operate, depending on the service.

<doc id="1306522" wikidata="Q779984" url="?curid=1306522" title="Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport">
<text>Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport (, formerly , ) is an international airport located northwest of Gdańsk, Poland, not far from the city centres of the Tricity metropolitan area: Gdańsk (), Sopot () and Gdynia (). Since 2004, the airport has been named after Lech Wałęsa, the former president of Poland from 1990 to 1995. With more than 6.7 million passengers served in 2024, it is the 3rd busiest airport in Poland in terms of passenger traffic, behind Warsaw Chopin Airport and Kraków John Paul II International Airport. It is also the 82nd busiest airport in Europe.

==History==

===Early years (1910s–1950s)===
The first passenger flights in Gdańsk were operated in the year 1919 from an airfield in the Langfuhr district of the Free City of Danzig (now the Wrzeszcz district of Gdańsk). It was possible thanks to a transformation of that military location into a civilian facility. The airport was at that time additionally used for airmail services and by the police. In the next years, the airport continued acquisitions of further areas which allowed it to expand and invest in modern infrastructure. The technical development of Gdansk Wrzeszcz Airport (Danzig-Langfuhr Airport) was followed by the launching of regular routes to Warsaw, Berlin, Moscow, Königsberg and other important cities of the region. The flights were operated by numerous international aviation companies.
The first Polish route was served between Gdańsk, Warsaw and Lviv by Aerolloyd beginning in September 1922. The company initially used Junkers F.13 aircraft on that route. This domestic service was the beginning of the company which later became LOT Polish Airlines, which is still Poland&#x27;s national carrier.

===New location since 1970s===
As the airport facilities became outdated at the end of the 1960s (including runway lights which forced airport authorities to impose a ban on overnight flights), a new location near the village of Rębiechowo was chosen. The airport had to be built somewhere else also because of further urban development. New areas were needed in order to make it possible for the public investors to construct new buildings for the growing population of Gdańsk. Furthermore, a new, longer runway was necessary in order to allow larger jet airliners to take off and land safely as the era of modern jet aircraft began. The old airport in Wrzeszcz was officially closed on 1 May 1974, and a large housing estate was built on its grounds. Nowadays, only a few remaining elements of the old Wrzeszcz airport infrastructure can be found, including remnants of its main north–south oriented runway in what is now the Zaspa district.

After the closure of the old airport, the new one was built, and it opened in 1974 near the village of Rębiechowo (on westernmost land incorporated into the Gdańsk borough of Matarnia in 1973). The airport acquired its current name in 2004. There was some controversy as to whether the name should be spelled &quot;Lech Walesa&quot; (without diacritics, but better recognisable in the world) or &quot;Lech Wałęsa&quot; (with Polish letters, but difficult to write and pronounce for foreigners, the closest English phonetic approximation being &quot;Vawensa&quot;).

Since 1993, Gdańsk Airport has been owned 31.45% by the authorities of Pomeranian Voivodeship, 29.45% by the city of Gdańsk, 1.14% by the city of Gdynia, 0.35% by the city of Sopot and 37.61% by Polish Airports State Enterprise. In 2006, the airport served for the first time in its history more than 1 million passengers per year. In 2010, the passengers numbers exceeded 2 million. After the construction of a new modern passenger terminal with extended capacities (the opening took place in April 2012 ahead of the UEFA Euro 2012 football championships), the airport continued its development and it served for the first time over 3 million passengers in a single year in 2014. In summer 2015, airlines flying to and from the airport served over 50 regular routes as well as charter and cargo flights.

==Airport infrastructure==
===Airside facilities===

Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport has a single asphalt-concrete runway in the direction of 11/29. The runway is long and equipped with a modern ILS CAT IIIb allowing aircraft to land in foggy weather. The decision height established for the approach system in Gdańsk is , whereas the visibility minimum for pilots varies from to , the higher value being required in the initial one-third of the runway&#x27;s length. In addition, the navigation facilities at the airport are supplemented with a modern wide area multilateration system.

The runway as well as taxiways are equipped with light aids system using LED technology. The lighting of the runway can be remotely controlled from the flight control tower. The runway has eight exit taxiways leading to five parking aprons where up to 18 middle-sized aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737 or Airbus A321) can be parked. The airport also has an extra apron used in winter for de-icing of aircraft. The deicing pad has been constructed in a way which allows keeping up ecological standards.

===Passenger terminals===
====Terminal 1====

Terminal T1 was inaugurated in 1997 and has primarily served passengers flying to countries outside the Schengen Area in recent years. The facility covers an area of 9,662 square meters. Terminal 1 is currently not operational for passenger services and it is planned to be demolished as soon as the Terminal 2 expansion works begin in the next years.

====Terminal 2====
The first part of passenger terminal T2 was constructed in 2012, ahead of the UEFA European Football Championship held in Poland and Ukraine. At that time, Terminal T2 had a usable area of 39,433 square metres, catering mainly to departing passengers to Schengen countries. The new terminal was built to the west of the existing terminal T1, parallel to the proposed access road and the existing runway. This building was designed as a hall housing two functional zones - those related to the airport apron (airside) - baggage sorting and waiting areas, as well as zones related to the city side (landside) - ticket and baggage check-in halls (departures), airline offices, dining facilities, and services. The terminal has three above-ground floors and one underground floor. The terminals are connected by a connector at the first-floor level. The terminal was designed in such a way that it could be modularly expanded in subsequent stages, if necessary. An intermediate floor - a corridor for arrivals - had been planned on the aircraft parking apron side. On the apron side, four external staircases were designed on the forecourt of the terminal. The implementation of this project doubled the passenger capacity of Gdańsk Airport, from 2.5 to 5 million passengers annually.

From 2014 to 2015, Terminal T2 underwent expansion, increasing its total area by 5,512 square meters and its usable area by 15,537 square meters. The new part housed the arrivals zone.

Between 2019 and 2022, Gdańsk Airport expanded Terminal T2 with a new western pier, adding 16,000 square meters of usable space. Functionally, it extends Terminal T2 by an additional 180 meters and is 46 meters wide. Structurally, it is a completely separate facility. On the ground floor of the pier, an expanded baggage claim hall has been implemented, where ultimately nine baggage system belts can be installed, along with an extended area for arrival baggage handling, a passport control zone equipped with six document control points for arriving passengers from Non-Schengen and third countries, and communication space to gates for Schengen, Non-Schengen, and third-country flights, along with accompanying facilities: service rooms, airport service areas, technical rooms, and restrooms. On the northern side of the pier, a driveway for buses to two bus gates has been constructed, allowing direct access from the airport apron to the first-floor level.

On the first floor, a departure hall with three dual jet bridges for non-Schengen flights and one for Schengen flights was constructed. Rooms for the Border Guard, Customs Office, and airport services were established. The spatial layout of the hall serves as an extension of the existing terminal T2 hall.

The distinctive multi-level roofing structure and steel framework, constituting a unique feature and recognizable symbol of the Gdańsk Airport, serve as the primary reference point for the design of the new western pier.

The airport offers nine jet bridges, which directly connect passengers to airplanes. As of 2024, these are the only passenger boarding bridges in Poland that are also compatible with turboprop aircraft such as the Bombardier Q400.

Upon arrival in Gdańsk, rental cars are available from several car rental companies. From Terminal T2, passengers can directly access the platforms of the Pomeranian Metropolitan Railway.

<doc id="1306526" wikidata="Q7243849" url="?curid=1306526" title="Prince Charles Cinema">
<text>The Prince Charles Cinema (PCC) is a repertory cinema located in Leicester Place, north of Leicester Square in the West End of London. It shows a rotating programme of cult, arthouse, and classic films alongside recent Hollywood releases – typically more than forty different films a week on two screens (300 velvet seats downstairs and 104 high back leather seats upstairs). It also regularly hosts a sing-a-long version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, as well as &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and &quot;The Room&quot;. The cinema has achieved a cult status amongst fans, and is the only independent cinema in the West End.

== History ==
Constructed between 1961 and 1962, the building was built by Richard Costain Limited for Alfred Esdaile and designed by Carl Fisher and Associates. The building, named for then-Prince Charles, originally functioned as a theatre with a distinctive &#x27;satellite dish&#x27; curve to the floor of the stalls, meaning that audience members are sat at an upwards angle as they face the stage. In 1964 an edition of &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot; was filmed there with a performance on the stage by Judy Garland. 

After a short period supporting the dramatic arts, the venue was reinvented as a porn cinema, and began showing European arthouse movies with &quot;a level of nudity that British and American cinema wasn’t ready for&quot;. During this period it hosted the UK&#x27;s longest continuous run of &quot;Emmanuelle&quot;, as well as &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979). By the 1980s it also showed horror films, such as The Evil Dead, and in 1987 it hosted the world premiere of Hellraiser.

The Prince Charles was taken over by Robins Cinemas in April 1991, and it was then that it became largely a repertory cinema.

The cinema was used as the setting for a number of stunts in the British sketch show &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot; in the early 2000s. Filming was facilitated by the cinema having a balcony at the time from which aerial shots could be taken, which was later converted into a second screen in 2008.

During the UK launch of &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004), Uma Thurman recorded a special video introduction for a double bill of both movies being held at the cinema. In it she welcomed the audience to &quot;Quentin&#x27;s favourite UK cinema&quot;. Quentin Tarantino has said, &quot;The Prince Charles Cinema is everything an independent movie theatre should be. For lovers of quality films, this is Mecca.&quot; and &quot;The day &quot;Kill Bill&quot; plays the Prince Charles is the day &quot;Kill Bill&quot; truly comes home.&quot; He further described it as London&#x27;s &quot;queen&#x27;s jewel&quot; of a grindhouse saying &quot;I was so honoured when &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; hit so big there that they started playing it at midnight and all the lads would show up in the black suits with little squirt guns&quot;.

In April 2007, the cinema opened an official Kevin Smith toilet cubicle, after the director held a question and answer session at the cinema. He said &quot;I don&#x27;t know, Quentin Tarantino has never turned up here and they name the bar after him, it&#x27;s my second visit and they haven&#x27;t even named a toilet after me!&quot; The next day they screwed a framed picture of him to the first cubicle in the gents and he officially opened the toilet. The Kevin Smith cubicle is now in the ladies toilets as the cinema swapped the ladies and gents in late 2013. 

As a commitment to promoting environmental causes, the PCC screened the documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; every week of 2007. Often the screenings have Q&amp;As with special guests; previous speakers have included Tony Juniper, David Miliband and Sir Menzies Campbell.

The cinema and surrounding area was featured in the music video to &quot;Golden Gaze&quot; by Ian Brown. Peter Doherty, lead singer of The Libertines, worked at the cinema for several months in 1999 before being dismissed. 

In Time Out Magazine in 2021, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson chose the cinema as his favourite in London, going on to say &quot;‘The Prince Charles has a place in my heart. It’s the people, the programming, the accessibility, feeling, texture... you cannot go wrong. You also know that on any given day, you can close your eyes, press your finger to the programme and you’ll hit something great. It’s like tuning into your favourite radio station&quot;. 

In 2023, after the Coronation of Charles III, the cinema announced that it had no intention of changing its name.

In June 2024, the cinema cancelled a planned world premiere of &quot;The Last Screenwriter&quot;, a film written by ChatGPT, amid concerns from its patrons about the use of artificial intelligence &quot;in place of a writer&quot;.

===Threat of closure===

On 28 January 2025, the staff of the PCC launched the #SaveThePCC movement, regarding the PCC&#x27;s premises&#x27; lease, stating that the new lease they had been offered by the building&#x27;s landlord Zedwell LSQ Ltd (which was set to expire in September 2025) was not what they were legally entitled to under Section 26 of the 1954 Landlord and Tenants Act. They stated that Zedwell were demanding to include a break clause into the building&#x27;s new lease. This would require the PCC to vacate the premises at 6 months&#x27; notice should Zedwell receive planning permission to redevelop the building, which the PCC interpreted as a &quot;clear intention to do so&quot;. Zedwell also want to raise the premises&#x27; rent, which the PCC claims would be &quot;at a level which no cinema proprietor would consider reasonable and refusing to supply any information to back this up&quot;.

Following the announcement, a petition was set up to Zedwell LSQ Ltd and its parent company Criterion Capital, which reached 10,000 signatures within an hour. By late February, the petition had reached over 160,000 signatures.

On 26 February, the PCC provided an update revealing that negotiations with Zedwell had resumed, writing &quot;Thank you for all your support thus far! Negotiations with the landlord have resumed &amp; are now feeling more positive that we will be able to get a lease without a break clause. There is still a long road ahead&quot;. The PCC also stressed the importance the petition had in restarting negotiations, writing &quot;It has been thanks to you that we have been able to speak to the landlord for the first time in 18 months and are now feeling more positive that we will be able to agree reasonable market terms for a lease without a break clause. We’ve still a long way to go but with all of you behind us, we’re sure we’ll make it&quot;

== Canopy ==
The canopy above the cinema is used for regular advertising for films, and sports cult film quotes or other obscure messages. Previous messages have cheered on England in the World Cup, proclaimed the cinema to be the ninth wonder of the world, after King Kong, and joked about other local cinemas.

<doc id="1306531" wikidata="Q186420" url="?curid=1306531" title="Sterling Sharpe">
<text>Sterling Sharpe (born April 6, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks, and played in the NFL from 1988 to 1994 with the Packers in a career shortened by a neck injury. He became an analyst for the NFL Network. He is the older brother of Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe. In February 2025, Sterling Sharpe was selected for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life and college==
Sharpe was born in Chicago to Pete Sharpe and Mary Alice Dixon. Growing up, Sharpe lived in Glennville, Georgia, with his grandparents and siblings, including his younger brother, Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe. He graduated Glennville High School, playing running back, quarterback and linebacker and was a member of the basketball and track teams. As a wide receiver at the University of South Carolina, Sharpe set school records with 169 career receptions and 2,497 receiving yards and a since-broken record of 17 career touchdowns. He also set the school record for single-season receiving touchdowns with 11, which was broken in 2005 by Sidney Rice. Sharpe&#x27;s No. 2 jersey was retired by South Carolina at the end of the 1987 regular season, making him the second Gamecock to be granted this honor while still playing. His college coach and mentor, William &quot;Tank&quot; Black, left the Gamecocks to become a player-manager and represented Sharpe throughout his professional career. Sharpe was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Professional career==
Sharpe was the first round, seventh overall, draft pick by the Packers in 1988 and had an immediate impact on the team. In his rookie season, he started all sixteen games and caught 55 passes. His sophomore season he led the league with 90 receptions, the first Packer to do so since Don Hutson in 1945, and broke Hutson&#x27;s records for receptions and receiving yards in a season. Sharpe was known as a tough receiver with strong hands, who was willing to go over the middle to make difficult catches in traffic.

A few years later, in 1992, Sharpe and the new quarterback, Brett Favre, teamed up to become one of the top passing tandems in the league. In the final game of that season, Sterling and Favre hooked up for Sharpe&#x27;s 107th reception of the season which broke the NFL&#x27;s single-season receptions record, set by Art Monk in 1984. That season, he became one of only eight players in NFL history to win the outright &quot;Triple Crown&quot; at the receiver position: leading the league in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and receptions. Ray Flaherty (1932), Don Hutson (1936, 1941–44), Elroy Hirsch (1951), and Raymond Berry (1959) achieved this in the years before the Super Bowl era. The only other players to accomplish this feat are Jerry Rice (1990), Steve Smith Sr. (2005), Cooper Kupp (2021), and Ja&#x27;Marr Chase (2024).

In the 1993 season he broke his own record, with 112 receptions, which also made him the first player to have consecutive seasons catching more than 100 passes. In 1994, his 18 touchdown receptions were the second-most in league history at the time, behind Jerry Rice&#x27;s 22 in 1987. On October 24, 1993, he became the second Packer in team history to catch four touchdown passes in one game since Don Hutson in 1945.

Sharpe&#x27;s tenure at wide receiver was cut short by a neck injury. Near the end of the 1994 season, it was found that he had a neck abnormality that needed surgery, as he had looseness in the top two vertebrae in his neck. He had stinger injuries against Atlanta and Tampa Bay. 
He had the surgery and never returned to football. It ended a career in which he was invited to the Pro Bowl five times (1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1994). Since he was unable to continue playing and was not on the Packers team that won the Super Bowl in 1996, his younger brother Shannon gave him the first of the three Super Bowl rings he won, citing him as a major influence in his life by saying: 

In the span of his seven seasons in the League, he was second in receptions and receiving yards and third in touchdowns (with Jerry Rice ahead of him in each category). His brother Shannon stated during his Hall of Fame induction ceremony, &quot;I am the only person in the Hall of Fame that can say I was the second-best player in my own family.&quot; In 2002, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

After his retirement from the NFL, Sharpe became an analyst for ESPN and then the NFL Network.

In 2024, he was named as a Seniors finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. On February 6, 2025, he was announced as an inductee for the 2025 class.

<doc id="1306539" wikidata="Q1535394" url="?curid=1306539" title="Nesidioblastosis">
<text>Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to excessive insulin production by pancreatic beta cells that have an abnormal microscopic appearance. The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century. The abnormal microscopic features of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement, pancreatic islet cell dysplasia, beta cells budding from ductal epithelium, and islets in close proximity to ducts.

By the 1970s, nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1980s it was used as a synonym for what is now referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism. Most congenital hyperinsulinism is now known to be caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern, and the term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features of nesidioblastosis were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even from adults, and are therefore not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

In recent years, the term has been revived to describe a form of &quot;acquired&quot; hyperinsulinism with beta cell hyperplasia found in adults, especially after gastrointestinal surgery.
Evidence of mechanisms explaining the ability of weight loss surgery to induce modern-day nesidioblastosis has yet to be found; any such mechanisms are of intense interest to diabetes researchers.

<doc id="1306542" wikidata="Q1352845" url="?curid=1306542" title="Norika Fujiwara">
<text>is a Japanese actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder. She became Miss Nippon in 1992 and was an exclusive model for CanCam fashion magazine. She has appeared in various commercials and TV series and a number of films in Japan.

==Biography==
===Career===
Fujiwara was born in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo Prefecture. After several years of model work, she became a journalist and spokesperson, including acting as an ambassador of Japanese - Korean friendship during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, reporting from the 2004 Olympics in Greece, and going to Afghanistan and holding a photo exhibition there. Fujiwara was formerly a guest announcer and interviewer for K-1 on their major shows until 2006 when she was replaced by Waka Inoue.

Fujiwara has additionally worked in the video game and anime markets; her latest work as the main character Alicia in &quot;Project Minerva&quot; (PlayStation 2) (2002), a squad-based, real-time semi-RPG versus rogue robots game, released in an updated English form with more missions as Project Minerva Professional by Midas Interactive of the UK. She voiced Princess Fiona in the Japanese-dubbed version of the &quot;Shrek&quot; films.

Fujiwara spent one month in a homestay program with a family in the United States and continues to study English. She reportedly hopes to someday act in an English-language film produced in the West such as in the United States or Great Britain. She has already applied her talent to the English language in the film &quot;China Strike Force&quot; (a.k.a. Spy_N in Japan, with the &quot;N&quot; standing for &quot;Norika&quot;) co-starring Aaron Kwok, Mark Dacascos and Coolio. In 2007, she visited India to meet Anand Kumar to make a documentary film on his Super 30 program.

Fujiwara also had a leading role in the live-action film &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot; where she played a semi-romantic role with Takashi Sorimachi.

===Political statement===
In September 2013, Fujiwara openly criticized the government&#x27;s state secrets bill pending before the Diet. Fujiwara wrote on her website, “Once the bill is signed, the people who will write the truth on the Internet (or through other means) will be punished... When I think of all the consequences that it will lead to, it really bothers me.” Her opinion reportedly was much noted given her status as ambassador for the Japanese Red Cross Society and as a recent recipient of the Nikkei Social Initiative Award for her contributions to society. Fujiwara was grouped with Tarō Yamamoto, another TV celebrity who recently broke Japanese custom by voicing political opinion.

===Personal life===
She married Osaka-based comedian Tomonori Jinnai on February 17, 2007 at Ikuta Shrine in Kobe city in Hyōgo Prefecture, and their romance became popular with the public and media. Rumors of their impending divorce emerged on March 19, 2009.

Kataoka Ainosuke VI (6th generation Kabuki actor) and Fujiwara were married September 23, 2016, dressed in traditional Japanese wedding clothes. The couple held their wedding banquet at The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on September 28, 2016, which was also where they held their marriage announcement press conference earlier in the year.

==Masashi Tashiro==
Fujiwara once hosted a sport program, called &quot;SRS&quot;, by Fuji Television with television star Masashi Tashiro. It was rumored that Masashi Tashiro may have secretly installed a hidden camera in the women&#x27;s restroom to covertly record Fujiwara and other women changing clothes or using the restroom facilities. However, no video or images from this supposed electronic surveillance has appeared.

<doc id="1306543" wikidata="Q5311254" url="?curid=1306543" title="Duce Staley">
<text>Duce Staley (born February 27, 1975) is an American football coach and former player who is the running backs coach for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served in the same capacity with the Detroit Lions during the 2021 and 2022 NFL seasons, and with the Philadelphia Eagles in various assistant coaching roles from 2011 to 2020.

Staley played college football as a running back for the South Carolina Gamecocks and was selected by the Eagles in the third round of the 1997 NFL draft, and during his playing career was best known for his tenure with the Eagles. Subsequently, he was a player with the Pittsburgh Steelers when they won Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks. Following the end of his playing career, Staley began his coaching career as a special teams quality control coach in 2011. He was promoted to the running backs coach in 2013 and given an additional role as assistant head coach in 2018. Staley was a coach with the Eagles when they won Super Bowl LII against the New England Patriots.

==Early years==
Staley attended Airport High School in West Columbia, South Carolina and was an All-State wide receiver, and played running back sparingly.

==Playing career==
===College===
As a senior at the University of South Carolina in 1996, Staley was ranked 13th in the nation in rushing with 1,116 rushing yards. In his collegiate career at South Carolina, Staley attempted 345 rushes for 1,852 yards (5.4 yards per carry). He also caught 59 passes for 489 yards and two touchdowns.

===National Football League===
====Philadelphia Eagles====
Staley was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1997 NFL draft and played for the Eagles through the 2003 season. After his rookie season and the departure of Ricky Watters, Staley became the starter in a tumultuous 3–13 season which led to the dismissal of head coach Ray Rhodes. Under Andy Reid, Staley developed into the team&#x27;s perennial leading receiver through Reid&#x27;s screen-heavy West Coast offense. However, he played in only five games of the 2000 season due to a serious Lisfranc fracture. Staley also missed some playing time in 2001 due to a shoulder injury. Entering the 2003 season, Staley held out of training camp in an attempt to bargain for a new contract, as he was in the last year of his deal. With Correll Buckhalter coming back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and Brian Westbrook entering his second season, the Eagles decided not to budge. This resulted in shared playing time among the three, as Westbrook became the premier back by season&#x27;s end. They were known as the &quot;Three-Headed Monster&quot;. Consequently, the Eagles decided to not re-sign Staley.

====Pittsburgh Steelers====
Staley signed a five-year, $14 million contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers on March 9, 2004. Staley had rooted for the Steelers when he was growing up. He instantly became the number one running back for his new team, and was seen as the eventual heir apparent for Jerome Bettis, who at the time had the sixth-most career rushing yards in NFL history.

Staley played in 10 games in 2004, and rushed for 830 yards. He only scored one touchdown however, as Bettis took most goal-line carries, and eventually took over the starting job since Staley missed six games.

In 2005, after both he and Bettis were injured, Willie Parker, an undrafted free agent, had a stellar season, and Staley, in another injury plagued season, was dropped to third-string, managing only 148 yards in five games, with a 3.9 yard per carry average. The Steelers went on to win Super Bowl XL, giving Staley his first ever championship.

Staley played just one snap in the Steelers&#x27; 2006 season-opening win against the Dolphins. The Steelers signed former Packers&#x27; running back Najeh Davenport the next day, and deactivated Staley for the rest of the season. On December 3, 2006, the Steelers released Staley. In his three-year tenure with the team, Staley played in just 16 games.

====Retirement====
Staley officially retired as an Eagle during the Eagles-Giants game on December 9, 2007. At halftime, Staley was escorted onto the field by former teammates for his retirement celebration featuring a brief ceremony and two highlight videos.

===NFL statistics===
==Coaching career==
===Philadelphia Eagles===
Staley became a coaching intern for the Philadelphia Eagles during the 2010 offseason. On February 8, 2011, Staley was promoted to special teams quality control coach. After the departure of Andy Reid, Staley remained on the new staff with Chip Kelly and was promoted to the team&#x27;s running backs coach. Kelly was fired as the team&#x27;s head coach in December 2015 and Staley was interviewed for the vacant head coaching job in January 2016. Staley was retained as the team&#x27;s running backs coach by new head coach Doug Pederson on January 20, 2016. On February 4, 2018, Staley won his first Super Bowl as a coach, and second overall, as the Eagles defeated the Patriots, 41–33, in Super Bowl LII. On February 20, 2018, Staley was promoted to assistant head coach while maintaining his running backs coach position.

On August 2, 2020, Eagles head coach Doug Pederson was diagnosed with COVID-19 during training camp. He planned to communicate with the team virtually during his quarantine, and he relinquished day-to-day head coaching duties to Staley in the interim. Pederson returned to the team on August 12.

The &quot;Duce Staley drill&quot;, a practice drill that Staley created to enhance players&#x27; footwork, was added to the NFL Scouting Combine in 2020.

===Detroit Lions===
On January 25, 2021, Staley was hired by the Detroit Lions as their assistant head coach and running backs coach under head coach Dan Campbell.

===Carolina Panthers===
On February 1, 2023, Staley joined new head coach Frank Reich and the Carolina Panthers as the running backs coach and assistant head coach positions. On November 27, Staley was fired along with quarterbacks coach Josh McCown and head coach Frank Reich.

===Cleveland Browns===
On February 5, 2024, Staley officially joined the Cleveland Browns as their new running backs coach.

==Personal life==
Staley is married to Maria Steadman, with three daughters and four sons. He is a native of Columbia, South Carolina, which is where he resides during the offseason. He underwent an innovative rehabilitation period prior to the 2001 season to become the first skill position NFL player known to return from a Lisfranc injury. He annually holds The Duce Staley Football Camp at West Chester University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which benefits several charities, including First Steps Program in South Carolina, the Variety Club, and Direct Care for Kids. He launched the Catch 22 Foundation to help single mothers. He donated $25,000 to South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges First Steps early childhood education program in 1999 to help improve education in the state.

His son, Damani, played linebacker for the South Carolina Gamecocks from 2018 to 2021.

<text>Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov (; 26 August 17872 May 1869) was a Russian nobleman, military commander and statesman. He was made adjutant general in 1817 and admiral in 1833.

A great-grandson of Alexander Danilovich Menshikov, Duke of Ingria, and a cognatic descendant of the Princely House of Golitsyn (another of his great-grandfathers was Prince Mikhail Golitsyn, the military governor of Åbo during the Russian occupation in the Great Northern War). Menshikov entered the Russian service as attaché to the embassy at Vienna in 1809. He became close to Tsar Alexander I and accompanied him throughout his campaigns against Napoleon. In 1817 Menshikov was appointed acting Quartermaster general of the General Staff. In 1823, he was transferred to the ministry of foreign affairs. Menshikov retired from army service in 1824.

During the initiation of the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28 and the success of Abbas Mirza&#x27;s initiative in Tehran, Menshikov was placed under house arrest. He was appointed head of the Naval Headquarters and cabinet minister by Tsar Nicholas I. He distinguished himself at the Siege of Varna in 1828 when an exploding Turkish cannon shell emasculated him. In 1830 he became a member of the State Council. In 1831 Menshikov held the post of Governor-General of Finland. He mainly devoted himself to naval matters. His bad influence on the development of the Russian Navy stalled its technical progress and combat training.

In 1853, Menshikov was sent on a special mission to Constantinople, and when the Crimean War broke out he was appointed commander-in-chief on land and sea. He commanded the Russian army at Alma and Inkerman and showed incompetence and lack of military talent. On 15 February 1855 Menshikov was removed from command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov. Between December 1855 and April 1856, he held the post of Governor General of Kronstadt and then retired. He died in St. Petersburg.

He was created Prince (Fürst) in the Finnish nobility, being the only person of the rank of prince to be registered in the Finnish House of Nobility.

The first Finnish steamship &quot;Furst Menschikoff&quot; was named after him.

<doc id="1306551" wikidata="Q2620430" url="?curid=1306551" title="Financial endowment">
<text>A financial endowment is a legal structure for managing, and in many cases indefinitely perpetuating, a pool of financial, real estate, or other investments for a specific purpose according to the will of its founders and donors. Endowments are often structured so that the inflation-adjusted principal or &quot;corpus&quot; value is kept intact, while a portion of the fund can be (and in some cases must be) spent each year, utilizing a prudent spending policy. 

Endowments are often governed and managed either as a nonprofit corporation, a charitable foundation, or a private foundation that, while serving a good cause, might not qualify as a public charity. In some jurisdictions, it is common for endowed funds to be established as a trust independent of the organizations and the causes the endowment is meant to serve. Institutions that commonly manage endowments include academic institutions (e.g., colleges, universities, and private schools); cultural institutions (e.g., museums, libraries, and theaters); service organizations (e.g., hospitals, retirement homes; the Red Cross); and religious organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, mosques).

Private endowments are some of the wealthiest entities in the world, notably private higher education endowments. Harvard University&#x27;s endowment (valued at $53.2 billion ) is the largest academic endowment in the world. , the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were the world&#x27;s wealthiest private foundations, with an endowment of $167 billion and $67.3 billion, respectively.

==Types==
Most private endowments in the United States are governed by the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act which is based in part on the concept of donor intent that helps define what restrictions are imposed on the principal and earnings of the fund. Endowments in the United States are commonly categorized in one of four ways:

#Restricted endowment (also called permanent endowment). This is the type that is subject to UPMIFA in most states. The donor has stated that the gift is to be held permanently as an endowment, either for general purposes or for specific (or restricted) purposes.
#Quasi endowment funds are designated endowments by an organization&#x27;s governing body rather than by the donor. Therefore, both the principal and the income may be accessed at the organization&#x27;s discretion. Quasi endowment funds are still subject to any other donor restrictions or intent.
#Term endowment is created with a gift or funds set aside by the board which can be spent in their entirety upon a set date or occurrence, such as the death of the donor.
#Unrestricted endowments may be spent, saved, invested or distributed at the organization&#x27;s discretion.

Restricted endowments ensure that the original principal, inflation-adjusted, is held in perpetuity and prudent spending methods should be applied in order to avoid the erosion of corpus over reasonable time frames. Restricted endowments may also facilitate additional donor requirements.

In the UK there are two types of endowment: permanent or expendable. Endowments have specific conditions attached and normally specify how income can be spent and whether this counts as restricted or unrestricted income for accounting purposes. A permanent endowment is one where the capital cannot be spent, while an expendable endowment is one which can be spent in certain circumstance, specified in the endowment document, but not otherwise.

==Restrictions and donor intent==
Endowment revenue can be restricted by donors to serve many purposes. Endowed professorships or scholarships restricted to a particular subject are common; in some places, a donor could fund a trust exclusively for the support of a pet. Ignoring the restriction is called &quot;invading&quot; the endowment. But change of circumstance or financial duress like bankruptcy can preclude carrying out the donor&#x27;s intent. A court can alter the use of restricted endowment under a doctrine called cy-près meaning to find an alternative &quot;as near as possible&quot; to the donor&#x27;s intent.

==History==
The earliest were established by the Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius in Athens in AD 176. Aurelius created one endowed chair for each of the major schools of philosophy: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and Epicureanism. Later, similar endowments were set up in some other major cities of the Empire.

The earliest universities were founded in Europe, Asia and Africa. Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made early Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas, although madrasas were generally smaller, and individual teachers, rather than the madrasa itself, granted the license or degree.

Waqf (; ), also known as &#x27;hubous&#x27; (حُبوس) or &quot;mortmain&quot; property, is a similar concept from Islamic law, which typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets. The donated assets may be held by a charitable trust.

The two oldest known &quot;waqfiya&quot; (deed) documents are from the 9th century, while a third one dates from the early 10th century, all three within the Abbasid Period. The oldest dated &quot;waqfiya&quot; goes back to 876 CE, concerns a multi-volume Qur&#x27;an edition and is held by the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum in Istanbul. A possibly older &quot;waqfiya&quot; is a papyrus held by the Louvre Museum in Paris, with no written date but considered to be from the mid-9th century.

The earliest known waqf in Egypt, founded by financial official Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin Ali al-Madhara&#x27;i in 919 (during the Abbasid period), is a pond called Birkat Ḥabash together with its surrounding orchards, whose revenue was to be used to operate a hydraulic complex and feed the poor. In India, wakfs are relatively common among Muslim communities and are regulated by the Central Wakf Council and governed by Wakf Act 1995 (which superseded Wakf Act 1954).

==Modern college and university endowments==
Academic institutions, such as colleges and universities, will frequently control an endowment fund that finances a portion of the operating or capital requirements of the institution. In addition to a general endowment fund, each university may also control a number of restricted endowments that are intended to fund specific areas within the institution. The most common examples are endowed professorships (also known as named chairs), and endowed scholarships or fellowships.

The practice of endowing professorships began in the modern European university system in England on September 8, 1502, when Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and grandmother to the future king Henry VIII, created the first endowed chairs in divinity at the universities of Oxford (Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity) and Cambridge (Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity). Nearly 50 years later, Henry VIII established the Regius Professorships at both universities, this time in five subjects: divinity, civil law, Hebrew, Greek, and physic—the last of those corresponding to what is now known as medicine and basic sciences. Today, the University of Glasgow has fifteen Regius Professorships.

Private individuals also adopted the practice of endowing professorships. Isaac Newton held the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge beginning in 1669, more recently held by the celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking.

In the United States, the endowment is often integral to the financial health of educational institutions. Alumni or friends of institutions sometimes contribute capital to the endowment. The use of endowment funding is strong in the United States and Canada but less commonly found outside of North America, with the exceptions of Cambridge and Oxford universities. Endowment funds have also been created to support secondary and elementary school districts in several states in the United States.

===Endowed professorships===
An endowed professorship (or endowed chair) is a position permanently paid for with the revenue from an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. To set up an endowed chair generally costs between US$1 and $5 million at major research universities. Typically, the position is designated to be in a certain department. The donor might be allowed to name the position. Endowed professorships aid the university by providing a faculty member who does not have to be paid entirely out of the operating budget, allowing the university to either reduce its student-to-faculty ratio, a statistic used for college rankings and other institutional evaluations, or direct money that would otherwise have been spent on salaries toward other university needs. In addition, holding such a professorship is considered to be an honour in the academic world, and the university can use them to reward its best faculty or to recruit top professors from other institutions.

===Endowed faculty fellowships===
An endowed faculty fellow is a position permanently paid for to recruit and retain new and/or junior (and above) professors who have already demonstrated superior teaching and research. The donor might be allowed to name the faculty fellowship. A faculty fellow appointment cultivates confidence and institutional loyalty, keeping the institution competitive over hiring and retention of talents.

=== Endowed scholarships and fellowships ===
An endowed scholarship is tuition (and possibly other costs) assistance that is permanently paid for by an organisation or individual with the revenue of an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. It can be either merit-based or need-based (the latter is only awarded to those students for whom the college expense would cause their family financial hardship) depending on university policy or donor preferences. Some universities will facilitate donors&#x27; meeting the students they are helping. The amount that must be donated to start an endowed scholarship can vary greatly.

Fellowships are similar, although they are most commonly associated with graduate students. In addition to helping with tuition, they may also include a stipend. Fellowships with a stipend may encourage students to work on a doctorate. Frequently, teaching or working on research is a mandatory part of a fellowship.

== Charitable foundations ==


A foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a category of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that will typically provide funding and support for other charitable organizations through grants, but may engage directly in charitable activities. Foundations include public charitable foundations, such as community foundations, and private foundations which are typically endowed by an individual or family. The term foundation though may also be used by organizations not involved in public grant-making.

== Fiduciary management ==
A financial endowment is typically overseen by a board of trustees and managed by a trustee or team of professional managers. Typically, the financial operation of the endowment is designed to achieve the stated objectives of the endowment.

In the United States, typically 4–6% of the endowment&#x27;s assets are spent every year to fund operations or capital spending. Any excess earnings are typically reinvested to augment the endowment and to compensate for inflation and recessions in future years. This spending figure represents the proportion that historically could be spent without diminishing the principal amount of the endowment fund.

==Criticism and reforms==
===Donor intent===

The case of Leona Helmsley is often used to illustrate the downsides of the legal concept of donor intent as applied to endowments. In the 2000s, Helmsley bequested a multi-billion dollar trust to &quot;the care and welfare of dogs&quot;. This trust was estimated at the time to total 10 times more than the combined 2005 assets of all registered animal-related charities in the United States.

A court later overturned her expressed intent that the entire trust be used for &quot;the care and welfare of dogs&quot;, seemingly based on a technicality -- that intent was in a document separate from the actual trust and will documents. It is not clear whether her intent would have been upheld if it had been fully and legally incorporated in those documents.

In 1914, Frederick Goff sought to eliminate the &quot;dead hand&quot; of organized philanthropy and so created the Cleveland Foundation: the first community foundation. He created a corporately structured foundation that could utilize community gifts in a responsive and need-appropriate manner. Scrutiny and control resided in the &quot;live hand&quot; of the public as opposed to the &quot;dead hand&quot; of the founders of private foundations.

===Economic downturn===
Research published in the American Economic Review indicates that major academic endowments often act in times of economic downturn in a way opposite of the intention of the endowment. This behavior is referred to as endowment hoarding, reflecting the way that economic downturns often lead to endowments decreasing their payouts rather than increasing them to compensate for the downturn.

Large U.S.-based college and university endowments, which had posted large, highly publicized gains in the 1990s and 2000s, faced significant losses of principal in the 2008 economic downturn. The Harvard University endowment, which held $37 billion in June 2008, was reduced to $26 billion by mid-2009. Yale University, the pioneer of an approach that involved investing heavily in alternative investments such as real estate and private equity, reported an endowment of $16 billion as of September 2009, a 30% annualized loss that was more than predicted in December 2008. At Stanford University, the endowment was reduced from $17 billion to $12 billion as of September 2009. Brown University&#x27;s endowment fell 27 percent to $2.04 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009. George Washington University lost 18% in that same fiscal year, down to $1.08 billion.

In Canada, after the financial crisis in 2008, University of Toronto reported a loss of 31% ($545 million) of its previous year-end value in 2009. The loss is attributed to over-investment in hedge funds.

=== Endowment repatriation ===
Critics like Justice Funders&#x27; Dana Kawaoka-Chen call for &quot;redistributing all aspects of well-being, democratizing power, and shifting economic control to communities.&quot;. Endowment repatriation refers to campaigns that acknowledge the history of human and natural resource exploitation that is inherent to many large private funds. Repatriation campaigns ask for private endowments to be returned to the control of the people and communities that have been most affected by labor and environmental exploitation and often offer ethical frameworks for discussing endowment governance and repatriation.


After the Heron Foundation&#x27;s internal audit of its investments in 2011 uncovered an investment in a private prison that was directly contrary to the foundation&#x27;s mission, they developed and then began to advocate for a four-part ethical framework to endowment investments conceptualized as Human Capital, 
Natural Capital, Civic Capital, and Financial Capital.

Another example is the Ford Foundation&#x27;s co-founding of the independent Native Arts and Culture Foundation in 2007. The Ford Foundation provided a portion of the initial endowment after self-initiated research into the foundation&#x27;s financial support of Native and Indigenous artists and communities. This results of this research indicated &quot;the inadequacy of philanthropic support for Native arts and artists&quot;, related feedback from an unnamed Native leader that &quot;[o]nce [big foundations] put the stuff in place for an Indian program, then it is not usually funded very well. It lasts as long as the program officer who
had an interest and then goes away&quot; and recommended that an independent endowment be established and that &quot;[n]ative leadership is crucial&quot;.

=== Divestment campaigns and impact investing ===

Another approach to reforming endowments is the use of divestment campaigns to encourage endowments to not hold unethical investments. One of the earliest modern divestment campaigns was Disinvestment from South Africa which was used to protest apartheid policies. By the end of apartheid, more than 150 universities divested of South African investments, although it is not clear to what extent this campaign was responsible for ending the policy.

A proactive version of divestment campaigns is impact investing, or mission investing which refers to investments &quot;made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return.&quot; Impact investments provide capital to address social and environmental issues.

=== Endowment taxes ===

Generally, endowment taxes are the taxation of financial endowments that are otherwise not taxed due to their charitable, educational, or religious mission. Endowment taxes are sometimes enacted in response to criticisms that endowments are not operating as nonprofit organizations or that they have served as tax shelters, or that they are depriving local governments of essential property and other taxes.

<doc id="1306557" wikidata="Q3072622" url="?curid=1306557" title="Ricky Watters">
<text>Richard James Watters (born April 7, 1969) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, and Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). Watters played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, where he played wide receiver on the school&#x27;s 1988 national champion team. He also won Super Bowl XXIX as a member of the 1994 49ers over the San Diego Chargers. Watters was known throughout his playing career for his outstanding receiving skills and his unique high-step running style, which earned him the nickname Ricky &quot;Running&quot; Watters, from ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman.

Ricky Watters also has appeared in the movie &quot;Any Given Sunday.&quot; He was the running back for the fictional team the Dallas Knights, featured in the final game of the movie. Watters is listed in the credits, and his name is clearly shown on the back of his Knights #32 jersey.

Currently Watters is a motivational speaker for kids who, like himself, are adopted. He is also a recording artist, music producer, president and CEO of Tigero Entertainment, and an author, having written the book, &quot;For Who For What, a Warrior’s Journey&quot;. He was the head football coach for Oak Ridge High School in Orlando, Florida until resigning on October 1, 2013. An architecture major in college, he returned to Notre Dame in 2014 to complete the three final credits necessary for a graphic design degree.

==Early life==
Watters attended Bishop McDevitt High School in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he played quarterback and wore #12; he was a four-year letterman in football. He played pewee, pony, and varsity grade school football for Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament (OLBS) Golden Gales.

==College career==

===Recruitment and 1987 season===
Watters arrived at the University of Notre Dame in 1987 as a highly touted member of head coach Lou Holtz&#x27;s second recruiting class. The class was the Fighting Irish&#x27;s second consecutive top 10 recruiting class, following on the heels of the &#x27;86 class which included star quarterback Tony Rice. Watters began the season backing up Mark Green and occasionally returning kickoffs. Behind Rice and an infusion of new talent, the team went 8–4 and appeared in the Cotton Bowl Classic against Texas A&amp;M.

===1988 national championship season===
Following the departure of Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, Holtz moved Watters to Brown&#x27;s flanker position for the 1988 season to ignite the Irish passing attack. The move paid dividends as Watters led the team in receiving. Watters&#x27; contribution on special teams was equally impressive as he returned two punts for touchdowns.

====Suspension against USC====
Before the annual Notre Dame-USC game, Holtz suspended Watters and running back Tony Brooks for disciplinary reasons. Playing their biggest road game of the season against the #2 ranked Trojans without their leading receiver and rusher, Notre Dame pulled out a convincing 27–10 victory.

====Fiesta Bowl====
In a season filled with victories over ranked opponents, Notre Dame defeated the #3 ranked West Virginia 34–21 in the Fiesta Bowl to secure the school&#x27;s 11th national championship. With six All-Americans, the team cemented its place as one of the greatest teams in the history of college football.

===1989 season===
1989 would again see Notre Dame contending for the national championship. With teammate Tony Brooks suspended for the season for academic reasons, Holtz switched Watters back to tailback. Watters did not disappoint as Notre Dame spent 13 weeks ranked #1 before losing to Miami 27–10 in their regular season finale. The Irish concluded the season with a convincing 21–6 win over #1 ranked Colorado in the Orange Bowl, and finished the year ranked #2 behind Miami. For the season, Watters finished second on the team in rushing behind quarterback Tony Rice.

==Professional career==

Watters played for ten seasons in the NFL with San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Seattle. He was selected by San Francisco in the second round of the 1991 NFL draft, but sat out the entire 1991 season with injuries. He started at running back for the 49ers during the next three seasons, and San Francisco&#x27;s offense led the NFL in scoring and yardage each year. The 49ers reached the NFC Championship Game in 1992 and 1993, falling both times to the Dallas Cowboys, before finally vanquishing Dallas in the 1994 NFC Championship on their way to a Super Bowl championship. In a 1994 NFC Divisional Round game, Watters set an NFL postseason record with five rushing touchdowns in the game, as the 49ers trounced the New York Giants 44–3. His thirty points scored in the game set a new record for most scored by one player in a postseason game that still stands. In Super Bowl XXIX the following season, Watters scored three touchdowns in San Francisco&#x27;s 49–26 victory over the San Diego Chargers, tying a Super Bowl mark shared by fellow 49ers Roger Craig and Jerry Rice, and later matched by Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos, James White of the New England Patriots, and Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles.

Watters joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 1995 as a free agent. He gained notoriety in Philadelphia for his infamous line &quot;For who? For what?&quot; after his first game as an Eagle on September 3, 1995, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The line was an answer to a question on why he didn&#x27;t stretch himself to catch a Randall Cunningham pass that would&#x27;ve likely resulted in a big hit from a defender and instead &quot;short armed&quot; a pass to avoid contact in a 21–6 loss. But he quickly established himself as a very productive player for the Eagles, leading the league in yards from scrimmage in 1996 and helping Philadelphia get to the playoffs twice. In three seasons with the Eagles, he played and started every game and recorded 3,794 rushing yards and 31 rushing touchdowns on 975 carries. In 1998, Watters joined the Seahawks and played with them until his retirement in 2001. He finished his professional career with 10,643 yards rushing and 4,248 yards receiving and 91 total touchdowns in regular season play. As of the end of the 2011 NFL season, Watters is one of only two NFL running backs to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season for three teams, along with Willis McGahee. Watters was on the ballot along with Terrell Davis, former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, and others for the February 3, 2007 Pro Football Hall of Fame selections.

On a 2008 episode of &quot;NFL Top 10&quot;, a documentary series produced by the NFL Network, Watters was ranked #7 out of the top 10 players yet to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Despite his five Pro Bowl selections and his high rankings in total rushing yards, rushing touchdowns and total touchdowns, criticism of his lack of professional demeanor was cited by voters as a primary reason for his failure to be inducted. In particular, he was considered to be a &quot;loud mouth&quot; by some critics, who argued it overshadowed his on-the-field accomplishments. Others interviewed said his behavior was no different from other inductees, in particular, Joe Namath and Lawrence Taylor. The &quot;For Who, For What?&quot; incident is considered by former voters as a defining moment that could hurt his chances, as one Hall of Fame voter said that it would be brought up as a negative by someone whenever Watters&#x27; name came up in the future. Another explanation of why he has not yet been voted into the Hall was that despite scoring three touchdowns in Super Bowl XXIX, his achievement was overshadowed by the play of quarterback Steve Young, who threw for six touchdowns and won MVP honors. He has been a semifinalist for the Hall of Fame in 2020 and 2022.

<doc id="1306564" wikidata="Q1376882" url="?curid=1306564" title="European Physiology Modules">
<text>The European Physiology Module (EPM) is an International Standard Payload Rack for the Columbus Laboratory on board the International Space Station. The EPM rack was built by OHB-System in Bremen.

The EPM enables a better understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body. Research typically includes neuroscientific, cardiovascular, and physiological studies and investigations of metabolic processes.

The EPM performs physiological and biomedical tests and transmits the data to Earth for further analysis. The resulting data will provide insight into the human body&#x27;s processes in a microgravity environment.

The EPM provides equipment for the study of the human body, including three science modules: two active modules, CARDIOLAB and MEEMM, and one module (sample collection kit, or SCK) that includes equipment to enable collection of biological samples (blood, urine, and saliva).

==Description==
The facility will consist of separate modules in which investigators can install their hardware for study of the human body on ISS. The Cardiolab (CDL) and the Multi Electrodes Encephalogram Measurement Module (MEEMM) will be initially launched with the EPM facility.

The European Physiology Module is a double-rack multi-user facility that supports investigations of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, hormonal and body fluid shift, bone demineralization and neuroscience. The facility is based on a modular design concept to support diverse experiments. Human physiology experiments are aimed primarily at increasing our knowledge of how the human body reacts to long-duration weightlessness. However, this area of research also contributes to an increased understanding of terrestrial problems such as the ageing process, osteoporosis, balance disorders, and muscle wasting. Typical research areas include:

*Neuroscience - Neurovestibular control of posture, balance, and motion sensory coordination
*Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems - Control of blood volume and distribution; fluid volume shift
*Bone and Muscle Physiology - Muscle de-conditioning/atrophy
*Endocrinology, Nutrition and Metabolism - Hormonal regulation; demineralization

To correctly evaluate the on-board data, it is essential that reference (or baseline) data are collected prior to flight and following the return of the crew-members to Earth. For this reason, the EPM facility will provide a Baseline Data Collection Model (BDCM) system that includes functional copies of the on-board instruments. The BDCM will be readily transportable to ensure availability of the equipment for the pre-flight, launch and post-flight activities.
==Containers and operation==
The European Physiology Module includes the following science containers for medical experiments:

* Multi-Electrode Electroencephalography Module (MEEMM) - For neurologic scans of the brain. (Built by EREMS in Toulouse.)
* Samples Collection Kit (SCK) - Collection of different medical instruments and boxes for biologic probes.
* Cardiolab (CDL) - To scan the cardiovascular system. (Built by CADMOS in Toulouse.)

The EPM is operated according to ESA&#x27;s decentralised payload operation concept. The Facility Responsible Centre (FRC) for the EPM is CADMOS, located in Toulouse, France.

The different EPM models are:

* Flight Model (FM) - Delivered September 2005 to EADS SPACE Transportation, Bremen for integration.
* Trainings Model (TRM) - Delivered to the European Astronaut Centre (EAC), ESA in Cologne.
* Ground Model (GM-1) - Delivered July 2005 to the FRC, CADMOS.
* Ground Model (GM-2) - To be delivered in March 2006 to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC), NASA.
* Baseline Data Collection Model (BDCM) - Delivered in October 2005 to the FRC, CADMOS.

<doc id="1306583" wikidata="Q1510978" url="?curid=1306583" title="Marree Man">
<text>The Marree Man is a modern geoglyph created in 1998 in Outback South Australia. It depicts an Aboriginal man hunting with a boomerang or stick. It lies on a plateau at Finniss Springs, west of the township of Marree in central South Australia, approximately 12 km north-west of Callanna. It is just outside the Woomera Prohibited Area. The figure is tall with a perimeter of , extending over an area of about . Discovered fortuitously by a charter pilot in an overflight on 26 June 1998, it is one of the largest geoglyphs in the world, arguably second to the Sajama Lines). Its origin remains a mystery: no one claimed responsibility for its creation and no eye-witness has been found, notwithstanding the scale of the operation required to form the outline on the plateau floor. The description &quot;Stuart&#x27;s Giant&quot; was used in anonymous faxes sent to media as press releases in July 1998, in a reference to the explorer John McDouall Stuart.

Shortly after its discovery, the South Australian government closed the site following legal action taken in late July by native title claimants, but flights over the site were not forbidden as native title fell under federal government jurisdiction.

==Work==

The Marree Man geoglyph depicts a man holding either a woomera (used to launch a throwing stick) or a boomerang (but see Plaque section below).

By December 1998, it had been noted that the outline matched, in reverse, that of the Artemision bronze statue of Zeus raised from the Aegean Sea in 1928.

The lines outlining the figure were deep at the time of discovery and up to wide.
The image was gradually eroded through natural processes, but because the climate is extremely dry, the image was still visible in 2013. Although there is a layer of white chalky material slightly below the red soil, the figure was not defined to this depth.

Marree Man was created between 27 May 1998, when NASA&#x27;s Landsat-5 satellite showed the site undisturbed, and 12 June 1998, when the completed figure was visible.
In August 2016, work was carried out to redefine the geoglyph using a grader assisted by GPS. The work resulted in an outline clearly visible from the air, matching the original. Two decades after its creation it was speculated that the work itself could not have been created without GPS technology, then in its infancy.

==Discovery==
Trec Smith, a charter pilot flying between Marree and Coober Pedy, spotted the geoglyph from the air on 26 June 1998. It fascinated Australians because of its size and the mystery surrounding how it came to be there.

Subsequently, Shane Anderson from the William Creek Hotel, located north-west of the town of Marree, said the hotel had received an anonymous fax describing the location of the artwork.

===Anonymous press releases===
Several anonymous press releases sent to media and local businesses in July and August 1998 led to the suggestion that the Marree Man was created by people from the United States. The releases referred to &quot;your State of SA&quot;, &quot;Queensland Barrier Reef&quot;, and Aborigines &quot;from the local indigenous territories&quot; – terms not used by Australians. The press releases also mentioned the Great Serpent in Ohio, which is not well known outside the US. It was also conjectured that these features of the press releases may have been red herrings, inserted to provide an illusion of American authorship.

===Preservative bottle===
On 16 July 1998, it was reported that a small glass jar had been found in a trough freshly dug at the site containing a satellite photo of the Marree Man together with a note bearing a U.S. flag and references to the Branch Davidians and &quot;Stuart&#x27;s Giant&quot;.

===Plaque===
In January 1999, a fax sent to officials described a dedication plaque buried south of the nose of the figure. The plaque bore an American flag, long by wide, with an imprint of the Olympic rings, and the words,

In honour of the land they once knew. His attainments in these pursuits are extraordinary; a constant source of wonderment and admiration.

The words come from Hedley H. Finlayson&#x27;s 1946 book &quot;The Red Centre&quot;, in a section describing the hunting of wallabies with throwing sticks and with photographs of hunters without loincloths and other details seen in the &quot;Marree Man&quot;. The book describes hunters of the Pitjantjatjara tribe.

==Possible originators==
Experts who surveyed the geoglyph were reported as having concluded it was forged with an earthmoving machine and that the person responsible must have had extensive knowledge of satellite-linked global positioning systems. Bardius Goldberg, an eccentric Alice Springs artist who died in 2002 aged 61, was suggested as a possible creator of the work. A friend said:Bardius had a good understanding of global satellite technology, he had access to earthmoving equipment and there were suspicions he was involved from the start but no one could prove anything. ... If anyone was mad enough, talented enough and cheeky enough to do it, it was Bardius. ... [He received] $10,000 around the time the Marree Man was discovered. Bardius said he was under instructions not to discuss why he was paid. 

At the time, theories abounded that American personnel from Woomera created the figure. Others suggested that American soldiers stationed in Woomera were responsible, since the faxes used US spelling and references – but others suggested those clues could have been deliberately misleading.

==Reactions==
Much of the public and media reaction to the discovery of the figure was positive. &quot;The Advertiser&quot;, the state&#x27;s only daily newspaper, called for the figure to be made permanent by excavating the outline down to the white chalk layer.

At the time of discovery, the area was part of a Federal Court lawsuit through the National Native Title Tribunal to determine the traditional owners. The area was claimed by both the Arabunna people and the Dieri Mitha who had been in dispute for several years. The Dieri Mitha publicly complained of harm and exploitation of the Dreamtime, calling for the image to be erased and for the artist to be prosecuted. As native title claimants, the Dieri Mitha took legal action to stop charter flights and vehicles visiting the site, prompting the state government to close the area to the public shortly after discovery. The Arabunna replied, through a solicitor, that the area covered points of archaeological interest and that the artist could be prosecuted. In May 2012, the Federal Court handed native title to the Arabunna people.

The artwork was called environmental vandalism by the former Environment Minister, Dorothy Kotz, and graffiti by the South Australian chief of Aboriginal affairs, David Ruthman.

In June 2018, adventurer Dick Smith revealed that he had had a team working on investigating the origins of Marree Man for two years to no avail and was offering a A$5,000 reward for information leading to identifying its creators. The Government of South Australia subsequently stated that legal proceedings would not be initiated against the creators if they were identified.

<text>Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI or CHI) is a rare condition causing severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in newborns due to the overproduction of insulin. There are various causes of HI, some of which are known to be the result of a genetic mutation. Sometimes HI occurs on its own (isolated) and more rarely associated with other medical conditions (as a syndrome).

Congenital forms of hyperinsulinism can be transient (short-term) or persistent (long-term) and mild or severe. It can be the result of a defect in the entire pancreas (diffuse HI) or in just part of the pancreas (focal HI). Irrespective of the form, cause, or type, HI is a medical emergency that must be managed from its onset. There is no other hypoglycemic condition in the newborn period as dangerous as HI. Left untreated, hypoglycemia from HI can cause developmental disorders, seizures, permanent brain damage, and even death.

For those with focal HI, there is the potential for a cure with surgery. For those with diffuse HI, diazoxide is the only approved medication to treat hypoglycemia. For those who do not respond to diazoxide, the condition is often managed with continuous carbohydrates delivered through a feeding pump and a gastrostomy tube, and off-label use of medications such as octreotide given by injection. In the most severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove most of the pancreas. New and more effective treatments are in development for those who continue to have hypoglycemia on existing therapies and treatments, and those who experience adverse effects of current treatments.

The incidence of persistent HI has been found to range from 1:2,500 to 1:50,000 births depending on the region or country. The incidence of transient forms of HI has been estimated to be between 1:1200 and 1:2000.

==Signs and symptoms==
As HI is a congenital condition, an infant usually starts to show signs and symptoms within the first few days of life, although very occasionally symptoms may appear later in life. It is often difficult to identify signs and symptoms of HI because they are often confused with the typical behaviours of newborns and infants. About 60% of babies with HI develop hypoglycemia during the first month of life. An additional 30% will be diagnosed later in the first year and some later in life.

HI may present in several ways; common symptoms of hypoglycemia include:
* Irritability
* Lethargy (excessive sleepiness)
* Jitteriness/tremors
* Tachycardia or bradycardia
* Abnormal breathing patterns/apnoea
* Hypothermia
* Abnormal feeding behaviour (not waking for feeds, not sucking effectively, appearing unsettled and demanding very frequent feeds, especially after a period of feeding well)
* High-pitched cry
* Hypotonia (Loose/floppy muscles)
* Pale/pallor/cyanosis (bluish coloured skin)
* Sweating

Older children and adults&#x27; symptoms may also include headaches, confusion, and dizziness.

Parents often describe initial concerns or symptoms such as their infants &quot;not feeding well, being sleepy and jittery&quot;.

More severe symptoms, such as seizures (fits or convulsions), can occur with a prolonged or extremely low blood sugar level. If the blood sugar level is not corrected, it can lead to loss of consciousness and potential brain injury.

A simple blood sugar measurement is essential if there are any symptoms of hypoglycaemia.

==Cause==
Hyperinsulinism or congenital hyperinsulinism can be a genetic or acquired condition. Acquired HI may be secondary to factors around birth, such as growth restriction of the fetus, less oxygen to the baby, or maternal diabetes. Together, these are often called perinatal stress-induced HI. They are typically present in the first 24 hours of life but often resolve by two weeks of age.

In contrast to the resolving perinatal stress-induced low blood sugars, HI can also be due to a genetic cause. Therefore, genetic testing should be considered in children in whom acquired HI is unlikely. This typically includes those not responding to first-line medication diazoxide. A genetic cause is also possible in children responding to diazoxide but where low sugars persist beyond the first 4 months of life.

There are many different genetic forms of HI which can be present in isolation or as part of a wider condition, called a syndrome.

=== Isolated forms ===
Isolated hyperinsulinism occurs in the majority of individuals with HI. The most common genetic cause is a change in one or both copies of a gene that instructs the building of the potassium channel (ABCC8 and KCNJ11). This channel normally regulates insulin production from the β-cell in the pancreas in response to sugar levels in the blood. A change or fault in the channel leads to uncontrolled and excessive production of insulin. These changes in the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes can be inherited in a dominant or recessive manner. In the dominant form, a single (monoallelic) change inherited from one parent (or arising spontaneously) causes diffuse HI. In diffuse HI, the whole pancreas is affected. Dominant HI may be mild and respond to diazoxide or severe and diazoxide unresponsive. Some changes in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes are not inherited dominantly but are inherited recessively. In these families, each parent carries one copy of a faulty gene, but are themselves unaffected. A child will develop HI if they inherit two copies of the faulty ABCC8/KCNJ11 gene, one from each parent. Recessively inherited changes in the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes cause diffuse HI which typically does not respond to diazoxide. In some cases, a paternal copy of the faulty gene is inherited by the child which occurs in combination with a loss of the mother&#x27;s normal copy of the gene in the pancreas. This gives rise to focal HI where only one part of the pancreas (called a focal lesion) produces excess insulin.

If HI is severe and not responsive to medicines, rapid testing of the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes is recommended. This helps to identify the possibility of focal HI early in the course of the illness. Following a genetic finding, specialised positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using the radiotracer 18-fluoro-dopa can be used to localise the focal abnormality (lesion) for surgical removal. Genetic testing is also helpful to determine if two copies of faulty ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes are inherited – these indicate a diagnosis of diffuse HI that may not respond to diazoxide. Such cases require treatment with alternative medications such as octreotide and may need surgical removal of most of the pancreas. Therefore, early rapid genetic testing is important to guide the medical and surgical management of children with severe HI. Results from HI genetic testing are preferably analysed by molecular genetics laboratories experienced and specialised in HI.

Another common genetic cause of HI results from changes in the gene for the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This genetic form of HI is also known as GDH-CHI or GLUD1-CHI. These gene changes are inherited dominantly but may also arise spontaneously. In this condition, ammonia levels in the blood are mildly raised. Children and adults with GDH-CHI often respond to diazoxide. An excess of proteins in the diet can bring about low sugars, so a good carbohydrate-to-protein ratio is advisable. There are many other genetic causes of isolated HI. Examples include changes in the genes that make the enzymes hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene (SCHAD-CHI) and glucokinase (GCK-CHI). More recently, changes in hexokinase 1 (HK1), another enzyme similar to glucokinase have been identified to cause both mild and severe forms of illness.

=== Syndromic forms ===
Syndromic HI is less common than isolated HI. Data from patient registries suggest a prevalence of less than 1% among reported cases. In syndromic HI, genetic causes are common. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), an overgrowth syndrome is a well-recognized form of syndromic HI. Other syndromes that commonly feature HI include Kabuki syndrome and Turner syndrome. Most individuals with syndromic HI respond to treatment with diazoxide and HI may resolve over time. However, HI with BWS can be severe and be unresponsive to usual therapy.

==Diagnosis==

HI is due to dysregulation of the secretion of the hormone insulin from beta-cells in the pancreas. Insulin is present in the blood at the time of hypoglycemia rather than being suppressed. This can be difficult to measure due to fluctuation in insulin levels. The diagnosis of HI is made based on increased insulin action and/or inadequate suppression of plasma insulin during a time of hypoglycemia. Increased insulin action can be demonstrated by increased glucose requirement (e.g., &gt; 8 mg/kg/minute in a newborn compared to normal of 4-6 mg/kg/minute. Another sign of excess insulin action is suppressed blood levels of free fatty acids and ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) during hypoglycemia. The clinical diagnosis is also supported by a large blood glucose rise after glucagon administration at the time of hypoglycemia. Glucagon is another hormone secreted from the pancreas that opposes insulin action and stimulates the release of glucose from liver glycogen stores. Measurement of insulin, c-peptide (which is co-secreted with insulin) free fatty acids and ketones together with a glucagon stimulation test can be performed during the spontaneous time of hypoglycemia or during hypoglycemia induced by a period of supervised and monitored fasting. In newborn infants, there is a time of transitional hypoglycaemia due to hyperinsulinism for the first after birth 72 hours. Hence the clinical diagnosis is best established after 72 hours of age. Assessing blood ammonia and acylcarnitine profile, urinary metabolic profiles, in addition to provocative responses to protein and amino acids (leucine) may be helpful in defining the subtype of HI.

==Treatment==
The goal of treatment in hyperinsulinism is to prevent hypoglycemia-induced brain damage, thus, the goal of therapy is to maintain the blood sugar level in the normal range [&gt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L)]. The first step is the restoration of blood sugar level to the normal range after acute hypoglycemia, followed by the prevention of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which is common in congenital hyperinsulinism. This is best accomplished with intravenous dextrose initially.

Once the diagnosis of HI has been established, including determination of the genotype and phenotype, whenever possible, specific treatment should be initiated. Some of the following measures are often tried:

Diazoxide, a KATP channel opener, that inhibits insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea 1 (SUR1) component of the KATP channel, is the only drug with regulatory approval for the treatment of HI and the first-line of therapy for this condition. To prevent complications from diazoxide-induced fluid retention, diuretic therapy is typically initiated concomitantly with diazoxide. Dose selection and dose escalation should be carefully considered weighing the response and potential for side effects. Because of its long half-life, it may take up to 5 days to achieve a full therapeutic effect. An important next step is the assessment of the responsiveness to diazoxide, which has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Responsiveness to diazoxide is defined by the demonstration that the cardinal feature of HI, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, is corrected by treatment. This is best assessed by a fasting test demonstrating that the child can fast for 12-18 hours with plasma glucose ≥ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or that plasma betahydroxybutyrate increases to &gt; 1.8 mmol/L before plasma glucose decreases below 50-60 mg/dL (2.8-3.3 mmol/L) during fasting. Lack of responsiveness to diazoxide suggests the possibility that the HI is due to inactivating mutation(s) in the genes encoding the KATP channels which accounts for up to 90% of cases of diazoxide-unresponsive HI. For these cases, rapid genetic testing of the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 is critical to determine the likelihood of focal HI.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for focal HI, but before surgery, it is important to localize the lesion. These lesions are not visible using conventional imaging techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) However, specialized imaging using 18-F-L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan is almost 100% accurate in localizing a focal lesion. Expert assessment of the pancreatic histology during surgery using frozen biopsies and surgical expertise are key for the success of the surgery. The reported cure rate for focal HI is 97%.

For non-focal diazoxide-unresponsive cases, treatment options are limited. Off-label use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been the long-standing second line of treatment for HI, but its effectiveness is limited by the development of tachyphylaxis. It is important to note that in countries where diazoxide is not available, octreotide may be the first line of therapy. Because of its association with potentially fatal necrotizing enterocolitis, octreotide use in very young infants should be carefully considered weighting the risk versus the potential benefits. Octreotide is administrated as a subcutaneous injection typically every 6 hours but it can also be administrated continuously through a subcutaneous pump. Long-acting somatostatin analogues, octreotide LAR (administrated intramuscularly) and lanreotide (administered as a deep subcutaneous injection), are convenient options for older children. An alternative treatment approach for diazoxide-unresponsive cases that are either not eligible or unresponsive to somatostatin analogues is the use of a continuous infusion of dextrose through a gastrostomy tube.

== Prognosis ==
The outcomes of individuals with HI are affected by the disease process itself, including the consequences of delayed diagnosis, the side effects of therapy, and the effectiveness of treatment. 

Side effects of therapy are common in children treated with diazoxide and somatostatin analogues, affecting up to 50% of treated patients with various degrees of severity. Surgical outcomes are excellent for children with the focal form of HI with a cure rate of 97%. However, up to 50% of children with the diffuse form of the disease that undergo a near-total pancreatectomy continue to have hypoglycemia after surgery requiring additional therapy. Over time, these children developed insulin-dependent diabetes and pancreatic insufficiency. Ninety-one percent of children who had undergone a near-total pancreatectomy require insulin by age 14 years. 

The frequency of neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral problems in children with hyperinsulinism is as high as 40-50% across different patient types and countries. Therefore neurodevelopmental assessments should be performed throughout childhood, even in those children who have outgrown or have undergone surgical cure of the disease.

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of HI is variable. It ranges from 1:2500 in people where cousin marriages are common to 1:50,000 in other people. These numbers may be inaccurate as they are based on small numbers of children with HI admitted to hospitals. The incidence of persistent forms of HI has been reported in the UK to be 1:28,389. In Finland, the incidence has been reported to be 1:13,500. The incidence of transient forms of HI has been reported at 1:7400. However, perinatal stress induced hyperinsulinism is relatively common and so the figure is predicted to be higher. The true incidence of HI will not be known until newborn screening services are developed for HI.

The natural history of HI varies with the severity of illness and whether or not HI is transient. Children with severe HI are often unresponsive to medical treatment and may require pancreatic surgery. Although surgery is more likely in those with genetic forms of HI, there appears to be a reduction in severity over time, encouraging some clinicians to maintain normal glucose levels by a combination of medications such as octreotide and carbohydrate-rich feeds. Similarly, some children with changes in genes making up the potassium channel (ABCC8/KCNJ11) showed a reduction in severity.

Changes in a single copy of the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes can be inherited by dominant transmission, i.e., transmission from an affected parent to the child. In such children, remission can happen, although variably. In this group, some children and adults may also develop high blood sugar and diabetes in later life. Similarly, a change from low to high blood sugar can also be seen in those with changes in HNF1A and HNF4A genes.

The natural history of HI goes beyond the problem of hypoglycemia. An important consequence of early-life hypoglycemia is brain injury. Delays in childhood development have been reported in up to 50%, particularly in those with severe HI. Feeding problems are also reported commonly by parents. Feeding problems appear to be more frequent in children with severe HI and may continue over long periods.

The natural history of HI includes the onset and progress of treatment-related side effects. In the short term, diazoxide may cause life-threatening pulmonary hypertension but this happens only in a minority of cases. More commonly, many on diazoxide develop excess body hair or a change in facial features over a long time. Children with focal forms of HI treated by limited surgery to the pancreas are usually cured and have no residual pancreas problems. By contrast, those having more extensive surgery, for example, subtotal pancreatectomy, invariably develop diabetes requiring insulin by late childhood or adolescence. In the period after pancreatic surgery, they often have a combination of low and high sugars before frank diabetes. About half of such individuals develop the need for pancreatic enzyme supplements.

==History==
Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) has been referred to by a variety of names; nesidioblastosis and islet cell adenomatosis were favored in the 1970s, beta cell dysregulation syndrome or dysmaturation syndrome in the 1980s, and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) in the 1990s.

Symptomatic hypoglycemia caused by insulin was first recognized in 1922 when one of the first diabetes patients ever treated with insulin was found &quot;climbing the walls&quot; due to hypoglycemia induced by insulin. The first description of children with congenital hyperinsulinism was made in 1954 by Dr. Irvin McQuarrie in his presidential address to the American Pediatric Society. McQuarrie termed the disorder &quot;idiopathic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot; and several of his patients required the removal of most of their pancreas to control their hypoglycemia. McQuarrie suggested the disorder might be genetic since hypoglycemia ran in families of some of his patients; however, he incorrectly believed that insulin was not the cause, since no insulin-producing tumors were found in the pancreas of patients. The following year, Cochrane and colleagues in Toronto reported that hypoglycemia in some, but not all, cases of idiopathic hypoglycemia could be provoked by protein or by certain individual amino acids, especially leucine. &quot;Leucine-sensitive&quot; hypoglycemia provided the first indication that amino acids, as well as glucose, could be important stimulators of insulin release.

HI is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;nesidioblastosis&quot;, based on the appearance of the pancreatic tissue showing insulin cells arising from ductal structures. However, the term was discarded when it was shown that nesidioblastosis was merely a common feature of the pancreas in early infancy. It is now well recognised that HI is a disorder of beta-cell insulin regulation due to genetic mutations.

In 1964, Drash and colleagues reported that diazoxide, an antihypertensive that suppresses insulin secretion, controlled hypoglycemia in some children with HI; currently, this is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of hyperinsulinism.

In 1996, mutations causing HI were discovered in the genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11) that encode the K-ATP channel which serves a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Shortly thereafter, mutations in glucokinase (GCK) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) were also identified to cause HI. The list of HI genes has now grown to over 30. Rapid genetic testing for the most common HI genes has become part of standard diagnosis and can be helpful in identifying infants likely to have a focal form of HI that can be cured by surgical removal. In 2003, it was shown that radioactive 18-fluoro-DOPA PET scans could assist surgeons locate and resect focal HI tumors.

== Society and culture ==

=== Patient advocacy organizations ===
Patient advocacy organizations dedicated to improving the lives of people born with congenital hyperinsulinism play an important role in supporting people with the disease and their families, participating in and funding research on HI, and raising awareness of the condition. For example Congenital Hyperinsulinism International is a globally focused patient advocacy organization dedicated to improving the lives of people born with congenital hyperinsulinism. They are a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&#x27;s Rare as One Network, which is a group of patient-led organizations that have launched collaborative research networks.

Country-specific patient advocacy organizations include:
* Austria: Lobby4kids
* Argentina: Hiperinsulinismo Congénito (HICA)
* Brazil: Associação Hiperinsulinismo Congênito
* France: Association des Hyperinsulinismes
* Germany: Kongenitaler Hyperinsulinismus e.V.
* Italy: Vivere con C.H.I.
* Spain: Hiperinsulinismo Congenito
* Turkey: Konjenital Hiperinsülinizmli Hasta Aileleri Derneği
* United Kingdom: The Children&#x27;s Hyperinsulinism Charity

=== Patient registries ===
People with congenital hyperinsulinism can participate in a patient reported registry called the HI Global Registry. By submitting a survey on their experiences to the registry, people with HI can help research the condition.

=== Centers of Excellence ===
Since 2021, centers that provide the highest quality of care for people with congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) have been designated as Centers of Excellence (COE) by the Congenital Hyperinsulinism International (CHI). Being a COE also involves a commitment to research and collaboration.

The CHI Center of Excellence are:
* Congenital Hyperinsulinism Center at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia, PA, United States
* The Hyperinsulinism Center at Cook Children&#x27;s Medical Center in Fort Worth, TX, United States
* Congenital Hyperinsulinism Service at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, United Kingdom
* Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin and the University Children&#x27;s Hospital Duesseldorf partnership in Germany
* Collaborative Alliance on Congenital Hyperinsulinism (COACH) headquartered in Magdeburg, Germany

<text>Castlerigg Stone Circle (alternatively Keswick Carles, or Carles) is situated on a prominent hill to the east of Keswick, in the Lake District National Park, North West England. It is one of around 1,300 stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany, constructed as a part of a megalithic tradition that lasted from approximately 3,200 BC to 2500 BC, during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages.

Various archaeologists have mentioned the beauty and romance of Castlerigg and its surrounding landscape. In his study of the stone circles of Cumbria, archaeologist John Waterhouse commented that the site was &quot;one of the most visually impressive prehistoric monuments in Britain.&quot;

Every year, thousands of tourists travel to the site, making it the most visited stone circle in Cumbria. This plateau forms the raised centre of a natural amphitheatre created by the surrounding fells and from within the circle it is possible to see some of the highest peaks in Cumbria: Helvellyn, Skiddaw, Grasmoor and Blencathra.

==Description==
The stones are glacial erratic boulders composed of volcanic rock from the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Both andesitic lavas and tuffs (volcanic ashes) are represented. Castle Rigg sits on a deposit of glacial till, and it is likely that the boulders were originally part of this deposit. The stones are set in a flattened circle, measuring at its widest and at its narrowest. The heaviest stone has been estimated to weigh around 16 tons and the tallest stone measures approximately 2.3m high. There is a 3.3m wide gap in its northern edge, which may have been an entrance. Within the circle, abutting its eastern quadrant, is a roughly rectangular setting of a further 10 stones. The circle was probably constructed around 3200 BC (Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age), making it one of the earliest stone circles in Britain and possibly in Europe. It is important to archaeoastronomers who have noted that the sunrise during the September equinox (Autumn equinox) appears over the top of Threlkeld Knott, a hill 3.5 km to the east.

There is a tradition, as with other stone circles in Britain, that it is impossible to count the number of stones within Castlerigg; every attempt will result in a different answer. This tradition, however, may not be far from the truth. Due to erosion of the soil around the stones, caused by the large number of visitors to the monument, several smaller stones have &#x27;appeared&#x27; next to some of the larger stones. Because these stones are so small, they are likely to have been packing stones used to support the larger stones when the circle was constructed and would originally have been buried. Differences in opinion as to the exact number of stones within Castlerigg are usually down to whether the observer counts these small packing stones, or not; some count 38 and others, 42. The &#x27;official&#x27; number of stones, as represented on the National Trust information board at the monument, is 40.

In the early 20th century, a single outlying stone was erected by a farmer approximately 90m to the south west of Castlerigg. This stone has many linear &#x27;scars&#x27; along its side from being repeatedly struck by a plough, suggesting that it was once buried below the surface and also why the farmer dug it up. It is not possible to say whether this stone was originally part of the circle, or a naturally-deposited boulder.

==Archaeological speculation==

The original motives behind the construction of Castlerigg, its subsequent uses, and how these may have changed over time are not known. Current thinking has linked Castlerigg with the Neolithic Langdale axe industry in the nearby Langdale fells: the circle may have been a meeting place where these axes were traded or exchanged. Ritually deposited stone axes have been found all over Britain, suggesting that their uses went far beyond their practical capabilities. Exchange or trading of stone axes may not have been possible without first taking part in a ritual or ceremony. Recent dating of the notable &#x27;axe factory&#x27; at Pike o&#x27; Stickle, Great Langdale, indicates that production here likely ceased by 3300 BC, which predates proposed date for Castlerigg by at least 100 years.

==Antiquarian study of Castlerigg==

Two of Britain&#x27;s earliest antiquarians, John Aubrey (1626–97) and William Camden (1551–1623), visited Cumbria with an interest in studying the area&#x27;s megalithic monuments. Both described Long Meg and Her Daughters, another large stone circle to the northeast of Penrith, and recounted local legend and folklore associated with this monument, but neither writers mentions a visit to Castlerigg or the area around Keswick. John Aubrey was also the first writer to erroneously connect Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments with the Iron Age Druids.

It was not until the early 18th century that Castlerigg came to the attention of the wider public, when William Stukeley (1687–1765) visited the site, in 1725.

Stukeley&#x27;s account of his visit to Castlerigg is brief and was published in his &quot;Itinerarium Curiosum&quot; in 1776, 11 years after his death. Stukeley&#x27;s visit is important, as it is the earliest written record of the stone circle at Castlerigg:
...for a mile before we came to Keswick, on an eminence in the middle of a great concavity of those rude hills, and not far from the banks of the river Greata, I observed another Celtic work, very intire: it is 100 foot in diameter, and consists of forty stones, some very large. At the east end of it is a grave, made of such other stones, in number about ten: this is placed in the very east point of the circle, and within it: there is not a stone wanting, though some are removed a little out of their first station: they call it the Carsles, and, corruptly I suppose, Castle-rig. There seemed to be another larger circle in the next pasture toward the town.
(Stukeley 1969 Vol. II, 48).
Stukeley could be describing the circle as it stands today, as it has changed little in the three centuries since his visit. The rectangular enclosure within the circle, that Stukeley took to be a grave, still consists of 10 stones. It is not clear, however, why Stukeley believed the circle was not missing a single stone. Today there are several large gaps in the circle, suggesting that a number of stones may have indeed been either moved into a different position (possibly after the stone had fallen or been removed completely). Of course, there is no certainty today as to the original appearance of the circle, or how much it may have changed in the preceding millennia, prior to Stukeley&#x27;s visit. It is believed, however, that the circle survives today in a relatively intact state, changed certainly, but not so far from its original design.

Stukeley&#x27;s observation of a second circle in the next field is a great revelation that places the stones at Castlerigg in a whole new light; that he fails to deliver a description demonstrates well the frustration felt by modern researchers when dealing with the works of antiquarians. This account could easily be dismissed today as pure fancy or it could be thought that he had mistakenly described a natural feature, as there is no evidence of it today, either above ground or in the observations of later scholars.

==The 19th century==

The apparently unspoilt and seemingly timeless landscape setting of Castlerigg stone circle provided inspiration for the poets, painters and writers of the 19th-century Romantic movement. In John Keats&#x27; &quot;Hyperion&quot;, the passage &quot;Scarce images of life, one here, one there,/Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque/Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor…&quot; is alleged to have been inspired by his visit to the stones; a visit, it seems, with which he was less than impressed. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in 1799, visited Castlerigg with fellow poet William Wordsworth and wrote of it, that a mile and a half from Keswick stands &quot;…a Druidical circle&quot; [where] &quot;the mountains stand one behind the other, in orderly array as if evoked by and attentive to the assembly of white-vested wizards&quot;.

An early description of Castlerigg stone circle can be found in the 1843 book &quot;The Wonders of the World in Nature, Art and Mind&quot;, by Robert Sears. In the passage quoted below, Sears also quotes an earlier description of the circle by Ann Radcliffe (Mrs. Radcliffe).
The Druidical Circle, represented in the accompanying plate, is to be found on the summit of a bold and commanding eminence called Castle-Rigg, about a mile and a half on the old road, leading from Keswick, over the hills to Penrith,—a situation so wild, vast, and beautiful, that one cannot, perhaps, find better terms to convey an idea of it than by adopting the language of a celebrated female writer, (Mrs. Radclifle,) who, travelling over the same ground years ago, thus described the scene: &quot;Whether our judgment,&quot; she says, &quot; was influenced by the authority of a Druid&#x27;s choice, or that the place itself commanded the opinion, we thought this situation the most severely grand of any hitherto passed. There is, perhaps, not a single object in the scene that interrupts the solemn tone of feeling impressed by its general character of profound solitude, greatness, and awful wildness. Castle-Rigg is the centre point of three valleys that dart immediately under it from the eye, and whose mountains form part of an amphitheatre, which is completed by those of Borrowdale on the west, and by the precipices of Skiddaw and Saddleback, close on the north. The hue which pervades all these mountains is that of dark heath or rock; they are thrown into every form and direction that fancy would suggest, and are at that distance which allows all their grandeur to prevail. Such seclusion and sublimity were indeed well suited to the dark and wild mysteries of the Druids.&quot;
Sears then continues his description:
The one here represented is of the first, or simple class, and consists, at present, of about forty stones of different sizes, all, or most of them, of dark granite,— the highest about seven feet, several about four, and others considerably less; the few fir-trees in the centre are, of course, of very modern growth. The form may, with more propriety, be called an oval, being thirty-five yards in one direction, and thirty-three yards in another, in which respect it assimilates exactly to that of Rollrich; but what distinguishes this from all other Druidical remains of a similar nature, is the rectangular enclosure on the eastward side of the circle, including a space of about eight feet by four. The object of this is a matter of conjecture;—by some it is supposed to have been a sort of Holy of Holies where the Druids met, separated from the vulgar, to perform their rites, their divinations, or sit in council to determine controversies; others consider it to have been for the purposes of burial; probably it might have been intended for both.
The later 19th century saw an increase in research into Castlerigg stone circle. C W Dymond visited the circle in 1878 and 1881, from which visits he produced the first accurate plan of the stones. He marked the position of one of the internal cairns, showing that it was clearly visible at that time, but missed the other two cairns observed by Benjamin Williams in 1856 showing that these two features have never been clearly defined.

The only known archaeological excavation at Castlerigg was carried out by W K Dover in 1882, one year before the site was scheduled. His excavation targeted the internal rectangular enclosure at the eastern side of the circle and his account of his excavation is brief and hidden within details of a day trip to the circle on 5 October 1882, by members of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society, which was published in 1883:
Prior to the visit of the Society some excavations had been made under the superintendence of Mr. W Kinsey Dover, with the view of finding whether the subsoil would disclose anything that might lead to some conclusion as to the age or object of the circle. The following is Mr. Dover&#x27;s report: Length of inclosure within the Keswick stone circle, 22 feet, east and west; breadth, 11 feet, north and south. Length opened out, 18 feet to 19 feet; breadth, 3 feet 3 inches, with two cross cuts of about 2 feet. Depth of dark superficial soil to where the yellow undisturbed soil appears, 14 inches, with the exception of a small portion at the west end where the black soil mixed with stones continued to a depth of 3 feet. Near the bottom here, I found what I think to be a few small pieces of burned wood or charcoal, also some dark unctuous sort of earth, a sample of both I brought away. (Dover 1883, 505).
What subsequently happened to the samples of &#x27;burned wood or charcoal&#x27; and the &#x27;dark unctuous sort of earth&#x27; is unknown, other than they are now likely to be lost or, if not, too contaminated to be worth modern scientific analysis. Nevertheless, Dover&#x27;s excavation is the only one to have been carried out at Castlerigg. It is, however, believed by some, based on the dimensions given by Dover, that if any stratigraphy exists within the rectangular enclosure it would not have been completely destroyed and the potential to create a relative sequence between the circle and the enclosure should still be possible. It is unlikely that further excavation around the stones would be permitted today as it is neither threatened by farming or development and erosion of the ground surface by the many visitors to the site is kept in check and is not sufficient to affect the integrity of the stones.

==Recent research==

Much of our knowledge and understanding of Castlerigg stone circle has been passed down to us by the work of 18th-century antiquarians and 19th-century amateurs. Considering that the stone circles of Cumbria in general are of such antiquity, being among the earliest stone circles in the whole of Europe, it is surprising that so little work has been carried out here under modern conditions, and that none of the stone circles of Cumbria have so far been scientifically dated.

Since the 1960s, the names Aubrey Burl and Alexander Thom have become synonymous with stone circles and both men have contributed significantly to the literature on this subject, whilst taking opposing sides regarding their purpose and significance. The works of Burl strongly support the idea that any geometry within the circle, or astronomical alignments, are either purely coincidental or symbolic in nature. Thom, on the other hand, is a proponent of the circle builders being adept astronomers and mathematicians and suggests that these skills can be seen in all stone circles, everywhere. While neither Burl&#x27;s nor Thom&#x27;s works deal with Castlerigg exclusively, they do attempt to place all the stone circles of Britain in context to each other and to explain their purpose.

English Heritage subjected the scheduled area and the field to its immediate west to a geophysical survey in 1985 in order to improve our understanding of the stone circle and to provide a better interpretation for visitors. A full report of the findings from 1985 has still to be published.

In 2004, Margarita Díaz-Andreu, of the Department of Archaeology at Durham University, commissioned a survey of the stones at Castlerigg in response to claims that a &quot;spiral carving&quot; had been discovered there. A laser-scanning survey was used to record three-dimensional images of the stones. Only graffiti from more recent times was discovered and no trace of the alleged spiral was found.

==Pagan connections==
Castlerigg has no discernible solar alignments. Nevertheless, it remains a popular site to visit during solstice celebrations. In recent years this has seen damage caused to the site, and illegal pits, from fires or cremation deposits, are often visible within the centre of the circle.

==Conservation history==
Castlerigg stone circle was one of the monuments included in the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, which included a &#x27;Schedule&#x27; of 68 sites in Great Britain and Ireland. It thus became one of the first scheduled ancient monuments. The following year the stone circle was &#x27;taken in to state care&#x27;. Under the 1882 act a deed of guardianship could be entered into by a landowner, in which the monument, but not the land it stands on, becomes the property of the state. As one of the first such sites to enter into such an agreement it occupies a small place in the history of archaeological conservation. In 1913, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, one of the founders of the National Trust, was among the prime organisers of a public subscription which bought the field in which the stone circle stands, which he then donated to the National Trust. Responsibility for the stone circle remains with English Heritage, the successor body to the Ministry of Works, whilst ownership of the site is retained by the National Trust.

<text>Letter to Brezhnev is a 1985 British romantic comedy film about working-class life in Liverpool, written by Frank Clarke and directed by Chris Bernard. It starred Alexandra Pigg, Margi Clarke, Alfred Molina, Peter Firth and Tracy Marshak-Nash (credited as Tracy Lea). &quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot; presents Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s high-unemployment Liverpool as a depressed and tough city fallen on hard times.

==Plot and themes==
Two young women from Kirkby, a rough suburb of Liverpool, Teresa and Elaine, meet two Russian sailors, Sergei and Peter, and hook up for a night of fun and frolics. Teresa is looking for sex and a smile, Elaine wants love, romance and the dream of a life far away from the grime of Liverpool.

Amongst other themes, it reflects the constraints on working class women&#x27;s dreams. It also shows that many people do not get the chance to aspire to anything other than the humdrum lives they find before them as they walk away from school. Some of the characters worked in what they called &quot;the chicken factory&quot;, a slaughterhouse. It also reflects hope and ambition as despite awful odds, the protagonists pursue their dreams.

==Cast==
* Alexandra Pigg – Elaine
* Margi Clarke – Teresa
* Peter Firth – Peter
* Alfred Molina – Sergei
* Tracy Lea – Tracy
* Iggy Navarro – President of Soviet Union
* Ken Campbell – Newspaper reporter
* Angela Clarke – Josie (Elaine&#x27;s sister)
* Ted Wood – Mick
* Sharon Power – Charlie&#x27;s Girl

==Production==
The film was shot in three weeks on a small budget with fees deferred to those involved. Scenes were filmed in the State Nightclub, a prominent Liverpool venue in the 1980s. It assisted Liverpool in becoming the second most filmed city in the UK after London. For the soundtrack, Sandie Shaw re-recorded the song &quot;Always Something There to Remind Me&quot;, and Bronski Beat&#x27;s &quot;Hit That Perfect Beat&quot; was also used.

==Reception==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kevin Thomas described &quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot; as &quot;a winner, [and] further evidence of the enduring renewal of the British film industry&quot;. Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The zesty script by Frank Clarke is at once shamelessly romantic (&#x27;You look to the star and think of me&#x27;) and unromantically streetwise (&#x27;Talk about Russian hands and roamin&#x27; fingers&#x27;).&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; concluded:&quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot; is strong because it is simple. It is not really about romance at all. It is about how idealism can be a way of escaping from the rat race. It is about a young woman with the courage to try something dramatic to break out of the trap she&#x27;s in. It is also about a brave new tradition in British filmmaking, in which the heroes are ordinary people, seen with love.Kate Muir, writing for &quot;The Times&quot; in 2017, said the film &quot;creaks a little with age and its crew of young actors sometimes seems stagey. Yet it has ebullient energy&quot;. The reviewer for the BFI&#x27;s Screenonline website described it as having &quot;done more than perhaps any other film before or since in putting Liverpool on the cinematic map&quot;.

The film opened at the top of the UK box office where it remained for two weeks.

&quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot; holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on six reviews.

<doc id="1306607" wikidata="Q1518365" url="?curid=1306607" title="Odious debt">
<text>In international law, odious debt, also known as illegitimate debt, is a legal theory that says that the national debt incurred by a despotic regime should not be enforceable. Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the government that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion. Whether or not it is possible to discharge debts in this manner is a matter of dispute.

== History ==

The concept has antecedents dating back to the 1800s and support from diverse fields such as economics, philosophy, political science, history, and law.

The concept of odious debt was formalized in a 1927 treatise by Alexander Nahum Sack, a Russian émigré legal theorist. It was based on two 19th-century precedents—Mexico&#x27;s repudiation of debts incurred by Emperor Maximilian, and the denial by the United States of Cuban liability for debts incurred by the Spanish colonial regime.

Sack wrote:
When a despotic regime contracts a debt, not for the needs or in the state&#x27;s interests, but rather to strengthen itself, to suppress a popular insurrection, etc, this debt is odious for the people of the entire state. This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently, it falls with the regime&#x27;s demise. The reason why these odious debts cannot attach to the territory of the state is that they do not fulfill one of the conditions determining the lawfulness of State debts, namely that State debts must be incurred, and the proceeds used, for the needs and in the interests of the State. Odious debts, contracted and utilized for purposes which, to the lenders&#x27; knowledge, are contrary to the needs and the interests of the nation, are not binding on the nation – when it succeeds in overthrowing the government that contracted them – unless the debt is within the limits of real advantages that these debts might have afforded. The lenders have committed a hostile act against the people, they cannot expect a nation that has freed itself of a despotic regime to assume these odious debts, which are the personal debts of the ruler.
Sack theorized that such debts are not enforceable when (1) the lender should have known that (2) the debt was incurred without the consent and (3) without benefit to the populace. There are many examples of similar debt repudiation. 

Chief Justice William Howard Taft, acting as an arbiter, used the doctrine in 1923 to find that Costa Rica did not have to pay the United Kingdom debts incurred by the Federico Tinoco Granados regime.

Despite such rulings, Mitu Gulati argues that odious debt is not part of international law because &quot;[n]o national or international tribunal has ever cited Odious Debt as grounds for invalidating a sovereign obligation.&quot;

== Reception ==
Patricia Adams, executive director of Probe International, a Canadian environmental and public policy advocacy organization and author of &quot;Odious Debts: Loose Lending, Corruption, and the Third World&#x27;s Environmental Legacy&quot;, stated: &quot;by giving creditors an incentive to lend only for purposes that are transparent and of public benefit, future tyrants will lose their ability to finance their armies, and thus the war on terror and the cause of world peace will be better served.&quot; In a Cato Institute policy analysis, Adams suggested that debts incurred by Iraq during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s reign were odious because the money was spent on weapons, instruments of repression, and palaces.

A 2002 article by economists Seema Jayachandran and Michael Kremer renewed interest in this topic. They propose that the idea can be used to create a new type of economic sanction to block further borrowing by dictators. Jayachandran proposed new recommendations in November 2010 at the 10th anniversary of the Jubilee movement at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the loan sanctions model has been adopted by the Centre for Global Developments and has been the base for a number of further suggestions. Some think the doctrine could aid international development. Others think that the doctrine should allow even more kinds of debt to be canceled.

==Application==
After acquiring Puerto Rico through the Spanish–American War, the United States refused to pay the colony&#x27;s creditors, asserting they held odious debt.

In December 2008, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa attempted to default on Ecuador&#x27;s national debt, calling it illegitimate odious debt, because corrupt and despotic prior regimes contracted it. He succeeded in reducing the price of the debt letters before continuing paying the debt.

After the overthrow of Haiti&#x27;s Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986, there were calls to cancel Haiti&#x27;s debt owed to multilateral institutions, calling it unjust odious debt, and Haiti could better use the funds for education, health care, and basic infrastructure. As of February 2008, the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution had 66 co-sponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives. Several organizations in the United States issued action alerts around the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution, and a Congressional letter to the U.S. Treasury, including Jubilee USA, the Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti and Pax Christi USA.

<doc id="1306608" wikidata="Q83379" url="?curid=1306608" title="Triceps">
<text>The triceps, or triceps brachii (Latin for &quot;three-headed muscle of the arm&quot;), is a large muscle on the back of the upper limb of many vertebrates. It consists of three parts: the medial, lateral, and long head. It is the muscle principally responsible for extension of the elbow joint (straightening of the arm).

== Structure ==

* The long head arises from the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. It extends distally anterior to the teres minor and posterior to the teres major.

* The medial head arises proximally in the humerus, just inferior to the groove of the radial nerve; from the dorsal (back) surface of the humerus; from the medial intermuscular septum; and its distal part also arises from the lateral intermuscular septum. The medial head is mostly covered by the lateral and long heads and is only visible distally on the humerus.

* The lateral head arises from the dorsal surface of the humerus, lateral and proximal to the groove of the radial nerve, from the greater tubercle down to the region of the lateral intermuscular septum.

Each of the three fascicles has its own motorneuron subnucleus in the motor column in the spinal cord. The medial head is formed predominantly by small type I fibers and motor units, the lateral head of large type IIb fibers and motor units, and the long head of a mixture of fiber types and motor units. It has been suggested that each fascicle &quot;may be considered an independent muscle with specific functional roles.&quot;

The fibers converge to a single tendon to insert onto the olecranon process of the ulna (though some research indicates that there may be more than one tendon) and to the posterior wall of the capsule of the elbow joint where bursae (cushion sacks) are often found. Parts of the common tendon radiate into the fascia of the forearm and can almost cover the anconeus muscle.
===Innervation===
All three heads of the triceps brachii are classically believed to be innervated by the radial nerve. However, more recent studies observed that in around 14% of individuals, the long head of the triceps brachii was innervated by the axillary nerve, and in 3% it received dual innervation from both the radial nerve and axillary nerve.

===Variation===
A tendinous arch is frequently the origin of the long head and the tendon of latissimus dorsi. In rare cases, the long head can originate from the lateral margin of the scapula and from the capsule of the shoulder joint.

== Function ==
The triceps is an extensor muscle of the elbow joint and an antagonist of the biceps and brachialis muscles. It can also fixate the elbow joint when the forearm and hand are used for fine movements, e.g., when writing. It has been suggested that the long head fascicle is employed when sustained force generation is demanded, or when there is a need for a synergistic control of the shoulder and elbow or both. The lateral head is used for movements requiring occasional high-intensity force, while the medial fascicle enables more precise, low-force movements.

With its origin on the scapula, the long head also acts on the shoulder joint and is also involved in retroversion and adduction of the arm. It helps stabilise the shoulder joint at the top of the humerus.

==Training==
The triceps can be worked through either isolation or compound elbow extension movements and can contract statically to keep the arm straightened against resistance.

Isolation movements include cable push-downs, lying triceps extensions, and arm extensions behind the back. Examples of compound elbow extension include pressing movements like the push up, bench press, close grip bench press (flat, incline or decline), military press and dips. A closer grip targets the triceps more than wider grip movements.

Static contraction movements include pullovers, straight-arm pulldowns, and bent-over lateral raises, which are also used to build the deltoids and latissimus dorsi.

Ruptures of the triceps muscle are rare, and typically only occur in anabolic steroid users.

==Clinical significance==

The triceps reflex, elicited by hitting the triceps, is often used to test the function of the nerves of the arm. This tests spinal nerves C6 and C7, predominantly C7.

==History==

===Etymology===
It is sometimes called a three-headed muscle (Latin literally three-headed, &quot;tri&quot; - three, and &quot;ceps&quot;, from &quot;caput&quot; - head), because there are three bundles of muscles, each of different origins, joining at the elbow. Though a similarly named muscle, the triceps surae, is found on the lower leg, the triceps brachii is commonly called the triceps.

Historically, the plural form of &quot;triceps&quot; was &quot;tricipites&quot;, a form not in general use today; instead, &quot;triceps&quot; is both singular and plural (i.e., when referring to both arms).

==Other animals==
In the horse, 84%, 15%, and 3% of the total triceps muscle weight correspond to the long, lateral, and medial heads, respectively.

Many mammals, such as dogs, cattle, and pigs, have a fourth head, the accessory head. It lies between the lateral and medial heads. In humans, the anconeus is sometimes loosely called &quot;the fourth head of the triceps brachii&quot;.

<text>Ronald Michael Carroll is an American DJ, singer, songwriter and producer. He is primarily known in the house music circuit.

Carroll has worked with many of house&#x27;s most famous producers, including E-Smoove, Maurice Joshua, Bob Sinclar and Rod Carrillo. He has also produced, usually with partner Spero Pagos, for other vocalists or his own songs.

==Musical career==
Carroll was born in Chicago in 1968. As a boy, he learned to sing while a member of his church choir. As a teenager, he was a fan of rock band Kiss, but became interested in house music when he attended a high school dance and spent time watching the DJ perform. Carroll started performing as a DJ in the late 1980s in a club he himself opened. He released his first official record, &quot;My Prayer&quot;, in 1993, a track produced by local producers Hula (from the Outhere Brothers), Kay Fingers and Ron Trent. Because of his style of singing like a preacher, he received the nickname &quot;The Minister of Sound&quot;.

In 1994, he got his first big break when he attended the Winter Music Conference in Miami. Still an unknown outside Chicago, Carroll walked up to Louie Vega, who gave him a chance to write the lyrics to Barbara Tucker&#x27;s &quot;I Get Lifted&quot;. This allowed the opportunity to join Mike Dunn and Byron Stingily, also from the Chicago house scene, in the Deep Soul production company as singer, songwriter and producer. He wrote the lyrics for six tracks in Stingily&#x27;s album &quot;The Purist&quot; and also wrote and produced the anthem &quot;The Sermon&quot;. In 1996 he met Greek-American producer Spero Pagos, and the two created MOS Productions (for Ministers Of Sound), for the UC/Afterhours label.

On the label, he also met Mazi Namvar, who introduced him to the European house scene. This allowed him to take part in the French house classics &quot;My Love&quot; (produced by Kluster) and &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (produced by Superfunk), both released in 2000. The following year, he opened his own label, Body Music Records. Carroll&#x27;s activities as a singer in Europe brought him into contact with Dutch producers Hardsoul in 2003, for whom he wrote and sang in &quot;Back Together&quot;, followed in 2004 by &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; for Bob Sinclar and Axwell, a track that appeared on Sinclar&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Enjoy&quot;.

<doc id="1306622" wikidata="Q7337217" url="?curid=1306622" title="River Cary">
<text>The River Cary is a river in Somerset, England. It is sourced from the Park Pond in Castle Cary and flows towards the southwest.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Cary&quot; is uncertain. It may be derived from pre-Celtic &quot;kar-&quot;, meaning &quot;stony, hard&quot;, or the Celtic element &quot;car&quot; meaning &quot;dear, pleasant&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;cari&quot;, &quot;love&quot;).

==Course==
The River Cary has its source at Park Pond in Castle Cary, and then flows southwest through Cary Moor to Babcary, where there is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest at Babcary Meadows and Cary Fitzpaine. It then flows northwest through Charlton Mackrell to the north of Somerton, passing under the Somerton Viaduct. Here the river channel has been straightened and drains the surrounding wetland as it heads north to Kings Sedge Moor. The Cary passes through King&#x27;s Sedgemoor continuing west across the moors south of the Polden Hills. At Henley it joins the artificial channels of the Sutton Moor Rhyne and the King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain, both of which drain the wetland. Much of the water is now diverted into King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain, which continues across the moors to join the estuary of the River Parrett at Dunball.

==Pollution==
In 1995 a major pollution incident occurred when lindane and mercury seed dressing were poured down a drain which leads into the river near Somerton.

<text>Pan Tadeusz (full title: Sir Thaddeus, or the Last Foray in Lithuania: A Nobility&#x27;s Tale of the Years 1811–1812, in Twelve Books of Verse) is an epic poem by the Polish poet, writer, translator and philosopher Adam Mickiewicz. The book, written in Polish alexandrines, was first published by Aleksander Jełowicki on 28 June 1834 in Paris. It is deemed one of the last great epic poems in European literature.

&quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, Poland&#x27;s national epic, is compulsory reading in Polish schools and has been translated into 33 languages. A film version, directed by Andrzej Wajda, was released in 1999. In 2014 &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; was incorporated into Poland&#x27;s list in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme.
== Content ==
The story takes place over the course of five days in 1811 and two days in 1812, at a time in history when Poland had been divided between Russia, Prussia, and Austria (see Partitions of Poland) and erased from the political map of Europe, although in 1807 Napoleon had established a satellite Duchy of Warsaw in the Prussian partition which remained in existence until the Congress of Vienna held after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat.

The place is situated within the Russian partition, in the village of Soplicowo, the country estate of the Soplica clan. &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; recounts the story of two feuding noble families, and the love between Tadeusz Soplica (the title character) of one family, and Zosia of the other. A subplot involves a spontaneous revolt of the local inhabitants against the occupying Russian garrison. Mickiewicz, an exile in Paris and thus beyond the reach of Russian censorship, wrote openly about the occupation.

The Polish national poem begins with the words &quot;O Lithuania, my country!&quot;; this largely stems from the fact that the 19th-century concept of nationality had not yet been geopoliticized. The term &quot;Lithuania&quot; used by Mickiewicz refers to a geographical region of Grand Duchy of Lithuania within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The invocation of Pan Tadeusz remains one of the most recognizable pieces of Polish poetry.

&quot;Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw&quot;, the oldest cookbook in Polish, served as an inspiration for Mickiewicz&#x27;s nostalgic description of &quot;the last Old Polish feast&quot; in Pan Tadeusz. In his account of the fictional banquet in Book 12, the poet included the names of several dishes described in &quot;Compendium ferculorum&quot;, such as &quot;royal borscht&quot;, as well as two of the master chef&#x27;s secrets: the broth with pearls and a coin, and the three-way fish.

== Plot ==
A young Polish noble, Tadeusz Soplica, comes back from his education in Vilnius to his family estate in Soplicowo. Tadeusz is an orphan raised by his uncle – Judge Soplica, who is a younger brother of Tadeusz&#x27;s long lost father, Jacek Soplica. Tadeusz is greeted by the Seneschal (Wojski), a family friend. The Seneschal tells him about the trial between the Judge and Count Horeszko concerning the ownership of a castle which once belonged to Pantler Horeszko – the Count&#x27;s distant relative, a powerful aristocrat who was killed many years before. The trial is currently conducted by the Chamberlain (Podkomorzy), who is a friend and guest of the Judge. Tadeusz also meets Zosia – a young girl, granddaughter of the Pantler, who lives in the Judge&#x27;s household, and her caretaker Telimena – the Judge&#x27;s cousin. Tadeusz takes an interest in Zosia, but also flirts with Telimena.

Meanwhile, Count Horeszko visits the Castle, where he is greeted by Gerwazy, the warden and an old servant of the late Pantler. The Count reveals to Gerwazy he has little interest in the Castle and intends to give up the trial. Gerwazy in response tells the Count the story of the conflict between Soplica&#x27;s and Horeszko&#x27;s family. The Pantler often invited Jacek Soplica, Tadeusz&#x27;s father, to the Castle, as Jacek was very popular amongst lesser nobles in the land. Jacek aspired to marry the Pantler&#x27;s daughter, but was refused by the Pantler. Later, when Russian troops stormed the Castle during the Kościuszko&#x27;s uprising, Jacek suddenly arrived on the scene and shot the Pantler. Gerwazy swore to avenge his master, but Jacek disappeared. The story makes the Count excited about the conflict with the Soplicas and he decides he has to take the Castle back from the Judge.

News spreads that a bear was seen in a nearby forest. A great hunt for it begins, in which, amongst others, Tadeusz, the Seneschal, the Count and Gerwazy take part. Tadeusz and the Count are both attacked by the bear. They are saved by Father Robak, a Bernardin monk, who unexpectedly appears, grabs Gerwazy&#x27;s gun and shoots the bear. After the hunt, the Judge decides to give a feast. His servant Protazy advises to do so in the Castle, to demonstrate to everyone the Judge is its host. During the feast, an argument breaks out when Gerwazy accuses the Judge of trespassing and attacks Protazy when he accuses Gerwazy of the same. The Count stands in defense of Gerwazy and claims the Castle as his own. Fight ensues until Tadeusz stops it by challenging the Count to a duel next day. The Count angrily leaves and orders Gerwazy to get the support of lesser nobility of nearby villages to deal with the Soplicas by force.

Father Robak meets with the Judge and scolds him for the incident at the Castle. He reminds the Judge that his brother, Jacek, wanted him to make peace with the Horeszkos to atone for his murder of the Pantler. For that purpose, Jacek arranged for Zosia to be raised by the Soplicas and intended for her to marry Tadeusz, to bring the two conflicted houses together. Father Robak also speaks about Napoleonic armies soon arriving in Lithuania, urging that Poles should unite to fight against the Russians, rather than fight each other in petty disputes. The Judge is enthusiastic about fighting against the Russians but claims that the Count, being younger, should be the first to apologize.

The petty nobility of the land gather on Gerwazy&#x27;s call. They argue among themselves about organizing an uprising against the Russian forces occupying the land and news about the Napoleonic army, which they heard from Father Robak. Gerwazy convinces them that the Soplicas are the enemy within which should be dealt with first. 

The Count soon arrives at the Soplicas&#x27; manor and takes the family hostage with the help of his new supporters. However, the next day, Russian troops stationing nearby, intervene and arrest the Count&#x27;s followers, including Gerwazy. The Russian are commanded by Major Płut, who is actually a Pole who made a career in the Russian army. The second in command is Captain Ryków, a Russian sympathetic to the Poles. The Judge tries to convince Major Płut that the whole matter is just a quarrel between two neighbours and claims that he doesn&#x27;t bring any complaints against the Count. Płut however considers the Count&#x27;s supporters to be rebels. The Judge reluctantly accepts the Russians at his house, where, on the advice of Father Robak he gets them drunk, while Robak frees the arrested nobles. The fight breaks out when Major Płut makes drunken advances on Telimena and Tadeusz punches him in her defense. During the battle, Father Robak saves the Count&#x27;s and Gerwazy&#x27;s life, getting seriously wounded in the process. Captain Ryków ultimately surrenders the battle after suffering serious losses to the Poles, while Major Płut disappears.

Afterwards, the Judge tries to bribe Ryków to keep the whole incident silent. The Russian refuses the money, but promises the whole thing will be blamed on Major Płut drunkenly giving orders to attack. Gerwazy confesses he killed Płut to keep him silent. 

Father Robak predicts he will likely die the following night because of the wounds he suffered. He asks to talk alone with Gerwazy with just his brother, the Judge, present. He reveals he is really Jacek Soplica and tells his side of the story of the Pantler&#x27;s death. Jacek and the Pantler&#x27;s daughter were in love. The Pantler was aware of this, but, thinking Jacek of too low birth to marry his daughter, pretended to be oblivious. The Pantler treated Jacek as a friend for political reasons, needing his influence amongst the lesser nobility. Jacek suffered through the charade, until the Pantler openly asked him for an opinion about another candidate for a husband for his daughter. Jacek left without a word, intending to never visit the Castle again. Much later he witnessed the Castle being stormed by the Russians. Seeing the Pantler victorious and proud made Jacek overwhelmed with grief and anger - which drove him to kill the Pantler. 

Gerwazy admits that the Pantler wronged Jacek, and gives up his revenge, considering them even after Jacek (as Father Robak) sacrificed himself to save him and the Count&#x27;s. Gerwazy also reveals that the dying Pantler gave him a sign he forgave his killer. Father Robak dies the following night.

The nobles who took part in the battle against the Russians, including Tadeusz and the Count, are forced to leave the country, as they are in threat of being arrested by the Russian authorities. A year later, they come back as soldiers of the Polish troops in Napoleonic army. Gerwazy and Protazy, now friends, reminisce on the events from a year before. Tadeusz and Zosia get engaged.

<text>Edward II is a 1991 British romantic historical drama film directed by Derek Jarman and starring Steven Waddington, Tilda Swinton and Andrew Tiernan. It is based on the play of the same name by Christopher Marlowe. The plot revolves around Edward II of England&#x27;s infatuation with Piers Gaveston, which proves to be the downfall of both of them, thanks to the machinations of Roger Mortimer.

The film is staged in a postmodern style, using a mixture of contemporary and medieval props, sets and clothing. (The date &quot;1991&quot; appears on a royal proclamation at one point.) The gay content of the play is also brought to the fore by Jarman, notably by adding a homosexual sex scene and by depicting Edward&#x27;s army as gay rights protesters.

==Plot==
Once installed as king, following the death of his father, Edward II summons his friend and lover, Piers Gaveston, back to England from exile abroad, and showers him with gifts, titles, and abiding love. Their relationship is fiery and passionate, but it is the focus of gossip and derision throughout the kingdom. Upon his return, Gaveston takes revenge on the Bishop of Winchester, who had been responsible for his banishment from England during the previous reign, by personally torturing him. Kent, Edward&#x27;s brother, is the first to protest about Gaveston&#x27;s return. Many others feel the same way, including the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Mortimer, who is in charge of the kingdom&#x27;s military forces. Nevertheless, Edward defends his lover from his mounting enemies.

A pleasure-seeker, Edward is quite distracted from the affairs of the state, much to the distress and anger of the court (somber men and women in business suits). Queen Isabella, Edward&#x27;s French wife, vainly tries everything to win him back from his lover but is mercilessly rejected by her husband. Love-starved, Isabella turns to Gaveston, who inflames her desire by whispering obscenities in her ear and then mocks her responsiveness.

The handsome, hedonistic, and opportunistic Gaveston repels everyone except the King. His enemies join forces and threaten Edward with dethronement and exile; Edward is forced to comply with their wishes and sends Gaveston away. The lovers&#x27; separation is serenaded by Annie Lennox’s rendition of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot;.

The queen hopes that once Gaveston is away she can reconcile with her husband, but he rejects her once again. In a last effort to regain her husband&#x27;s affection, she allows Gaveston to return. The king and his lover resume their relationship, but their enemies are ready to strike back.

Isabella and Mortimer, who has become her lover, plan to rule the realm through Edward and Isabella&#x27;s young son, the future Edward III. When Kent tries to save his brother, he is murdered by Isabella. The nobles are soon plotting to get rid not only of Gaveston but also the king. Mortimer, their leader, is a military man and practicing sadomasochist who takes a grim pleasure in personally torturing Gaveston and the lovers&#x27; friend Spencer, whom he addresses as &quot;girl boy.&quot; Their torture takes place while there is a clash between the police and members of the British gay rights organisation Outrage.

After Gaveston and Spencer&#x27;s assassinations, Edward, who has been thrown in a dungeon, is executed by impalement on a red-hot poker. This hideous fate is presented as a nightmare from which the imprisoned king awakens. The executioner, when he does arrive, tosses away his lethal weapon and kisses the man he was sent to kill.

Back in the castle, Mortimer and Isabella enjoy their triumph just briefly. The king&#x27;s young son, Edward III, who all along has been neglected by both parents and who has witnessed their quarrels, has donned his mother&#x27;s earrings and lipstick and, while listening to classical music on his Walkman, walks atop a cage that imprisons his mother and Mortimer.

==Cast==

* Tilda Swinton as Isabella
* Andrew Tiernan as Piers Gaveston
* Nigel Terry as Mortimer

* Jerome Flynn as Kent
* Jody Graber as Prince Edward

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. It currently holds a 100% score on the review-aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a piercing cry from the heart&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Jarman for &quot;keeping the story streamlined and potently clear while retaining Marlowe&#x27;s poetic period language&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; called it one of &quot;Derek Jarman&#x27;s most accomplished films&quot;. The film has been considered a classic example of New Queer Cinema.

Jarman&#x27;s use of anachronism caught the attention of many critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; mentions that &quot;historical and modern&quot; timelines intersect in the costuming, the portrayal of Edward II&#x27;s army, and the soundtrack. The latter is perhaps the most startling of the anachronisms in the film as it is mentioned in several articles yet never critiqued. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes, “One of the oddest touches is the out-of-the-blue appearance of the singer Annie Lennox wistfully crooning Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot;”. Cole Porter was closeted for reasons that can be paralleled to Edward II&#x27;s queer lifestyle, as “public knowledge of his sexuality, Porter feared, could compromise his success&quot;. Similarly to Edward II, and &quot;like many gay public figures, Porter married a woman for convenience”. &quot;The LA Times&quot; reflects that Porter &quot;was aware that if you disclosed too much in Hollywood, you were likely to lose your job-- and your audience&quot;. However, Porter and Edward II differ as Porter remained closeted and Edward II (as summarised) was willing to risk his status to be with his lover, Gaveston. Jarman&#x27;s choice of artist, Annie Lennox, to sing Porter&#x27;s song is anachronistic in and of itself; the film provides a structure in which two different points in time intersect, 1944 and 1991, represented by someone who fears queerness and then by someone who advocates for the rights of the LGBT community. In fact, Lennox sang the song for the &quot;film Edward II after recording it for the Red Hot + Blue AIDS awareness tribute album to Cole Porter”. Regardless of reasons why Porter and Lennox were included in the film, it was recognised in a positive light. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Jarman&#x27;s &quot;decision to have Annie Lennox serenade the departing Gaveston and his lover with a rendition of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Every Time We Say Goodbye&quot; is a brilliant stroke; it&#x27;s Marlowe meets MTV&quot;.

<doc id="1306653" wikidata="Q839257" url="?curid=1306653" title="Wong Kei">
<text>Wong Kei () is a Chinese restaurant in London&#x27;s Chinatown, once described as &quot;the rudest restaurant in London&quot;. It is one of the largest Chinese restaurants in the UK with seating for around 500 diners.

==Restaurant==
Wong Kei was once known for the rudeness of its staff, who would shout &quot;Sit down with them!&quot; or &quot;Go upstairs!&quot; to arriving patrons, insult customers who asked for a knife and fork, and chase those who failed to leave a sufficient tip. This aspect was seen as a positive and enjoyable feature rather than a criticism of the restaurant. After a renovation, the restaurant reopened in 2001 with friendlier waiters, and when it reopened under new management in March 2014, new owner Daniel Luc said: &quot;Maybe there was an issue with rude staff 20 to 30 years ago, but I don&#x27;t think so any more. I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s a good thing or not.&quot;

==Building==
Wong Kei originally occupied two shops on nearby Rupert Court but is currently situated at 41–43 Wardour Street. This building was originally built by Willy Clarkson (1861–1934), at the time a well-known theatrical wig-maker and costumier. It was designed by the architect H. M. Wakeley in a mixed Baroque and Art Nouveau style. Sarah Bernhardt laid the foundation stone in 1904 and Sir Henry Irving laid the coping stone in 1905. 

Clarkson&#x27;s business operated there from 1905 until it ceased trading in 1940. The building retains an original clock over the entrance, advertising it as the premises of a &quot;Costumer&quot; and &quot;Perruquier&quot; (one who makes and sells wigs). In 1966, a blue plaque was fixed to the façade to commemorate Clarkson.

When Terence Dalley sketched the building in 1972, another Chinese restaurant, Lee Ho Fook, occupied the ground floor.

<doc id="1306656" wikidata="Q6818485" url="?curid=1306656" title="Mercian Regiment">
<text>The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords) is an infantry regiment of the British Army, which is recruited from five of the counties that formed the ancient kingdom of Mercia. Known as &#x27;The Heart of England&#x27;s Infantry&#x27;, it was formed on 1 September 2007 by the amalgamation of three existing regiments. The Regiment has had fifteen operational deployments since its formation.

==History==
The regiment&#x27;s formation was announced on 16 December 2004 by the then Secretary of Defence Geoff Hoon and General Sir Mike Jackson as part of the restructuring of the British Army Infantry - it consisted of three regular battalions, plus a territorial battalion, and was created through the merger of three single battalion regiments.

The antecedent regiments were, The 1st Battalion, Cheshire Regiment, The 1st Battalion, Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment and the 1st Battalion, Staffordshire Regiment. The reserve West Midlands Regiment, with elements of the King&#x27;s and Cheshire Regiment and the East of England Regiment formed the 4th Battalion, Mercian Regiment.

The regiment originally had 3 regular army battalions and one Army Reserve battalion, though the 3rd Battalion was disbanded, as part of the restructuring of the British Army, in July 2014. It had been part of the 7th Armoured Brigade based in Bad Fallingbostel, Germany. The regiment further restructured in September 2022 when the 2nd Battalion merged with the 1st Battalion. This happened as a result of the Integrated Review.

The regiment was deployed to Afghanistan (Herrick 6, Herrick 10, Herrick 12, Herrick 14, Herrick 15, Herrick 17 and Herrick 19) and to Iraq (Telic 11).

In 2017 the regiment moved to the King&#x27;s Division.

==Structure==
===Regimental Headquarters===
The regimental headquarters is situated at DMS Whittington in Lichfield, with outstations in Chester and Nottingham.

===1st Battalion===
The 1st Battalion has deployed on five operational tours since its formation in 2007, one to Iraq, two to Afghanistan, one to Ukraine, and one to Estonia. It is an armoured infantry battalion, part of the 12th Armoured Brigade Combat Team based at Bulford Camp, England.

===4th Battalion===
The 4th Battalion is the regiment&#x27;s Army Reserve Armoured Infantry battalion. The battalion, whose HQ is based in Wolverhampton and Kidderminster, England, has 2 rifle companies, a support and an HQ company.

==Regimental Distinctions==
The regiment&#x27;s cap badge is a double headed Mercian Eagle with Saxon crown. This has been chosen because it forms a link to the regiment&#x27;s recruiting area, which encompass a number of divergent counties that do not have modern traditional links, only under the ancient Kingdom of Mercia (unlike the other new regiments from Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire). It was originally intended to use the old Mercian Brigade badge worn by the Cheshire Regiment, Staffordshire Regiment, Worcestershire Regiment and Sherwood Foresters from 1958 to 1968, rather than create an amalgamated badge that would require elements from all of the antecedents. In 2005, this badge was rejected by the Army Dress Committee on the grounds that it had been the badge of a territorial unit, The Mercian Volunteers, which was junior to the amalgamating regiments. Accordingly, a slightly modified design featuring two colours of metal was adopted.

In 2012, following the announcement that the 3rd Battalion (ex-Staffordshire Regiment) was to be disbanded, a proposal was submitted to the Army to have the name of the Mercian Regiment changed to reflect its entire lineage and maintain the Staffords name. In July 2014, this proposal was approved, and the regiment was renamed as The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords).

===Mascot===

&quot;Derby&quot;, a Swaledale ram, is the regimental mascot, a tradition inherited from the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment. The 30th iteration of the Mascot was known as Lance Corporal Derby XXX, before he died on 27 November 2015. His successor, known as Private Derby XXXI, was announced on 20 February 2016 but he died on 1 September 2017.

In December 2017 Private Derby XXXII was presented to the Regiment by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire at Chatsworth House. Private Derby was received by Brigadier Williams, OBE, Colonel of the Regiment.

Private Derby led the Tamworth Carnival in 2019. According to his handlers this was the longest March Private Derby has done to date.

In July 2024 Derby XXXII was promoted to the rank of Corporal for the first time in the history of his lineage. The promotion took place following the annual pilgrimage to the regimental memorial at Crich on 7 July 2024.

The regiment also maintains loose links through its Regimental Headquarters with the former mascot of the Staffordshire Regiment, Watchman, who now carries out his duties as part of the Staffordshire Regiment Association.

===Dress===
Various &quot;Golden Threads&quot;, representing the traditions of predecessor units, are incorporated in the Mercian Regiment&#x27;s uniform:
*Arm badge: a gold wire Stafford knot and glider badge with a backing of &quot;Brown Holland&quot; material on a black felt patch from the Staffordshire Regiment 
*Collar badge: oak leaves and acorn from the Cheshire Regiment combined with the motto &quot;Firm&quot; from the Worcestershire Regiment 
*Facing colour: buff, from the Cheshire Regiment. To be worn on full dress uniform, mess dress and as piping on No.1 dress shoulder straps. 
*Sword frog on the Sam Browne Belt comes from the Worcestershire Regiment
*Officer&#x27;s rank badges will be coloured bronze/gun metal, from the North Staffordshire Regiment 
*Warrant officers&#x27; and NCO&#x27;s rank badges: Black backing from Staffordshire Regiment. 
*Cap badge backing: A square Lincoln green cloth backing worn behind the cap badge on the beret, from the Sherwood Foresters 
*Lanyards: Originally, each battalion wore a distinctively coloured lanyard on No.2 dress: red cerise for the 1st battalion, Lincoln green for the 2nd, black for the 3rd and Mercian blue for the 4th. A regimental pattern with twists of cerise, buff and green was worn by those who were extra-regimentally employed: this multi-coloured lanyard is now worn by all in the regiment. 
*Tactical Recognition Flashes: The regiment&#x27;s TRF is a 3 vertical striped diamond with cerise on the left, buff in the middle and Lincoln green on the right. Each Battalion also has their own, the 1st and 2nd Battalions use their antecedent regiment&#x27;s flashes, buff and cerise for the 1st and cerise and Lincoln green for the 2nd. The 3rd battalion has a black diamond with the Stafford knot and the 4th Battalion has a blue diamond with the Mercian Eagle on it.
*Regimental Side Hat: black with buff inner crease and green piping and peak. The cap badge is in silver and gold wire embroidery.
*Pullover: Buff, worn by officers and WOs, from the Cheshire Regiment.
*Stable Belt: Buff, from the Cheshire Regiment, with a bronze locket bearing the cap badge in brass.

===Band===
The Band of the Mercian Regiment is the regimental military band of the Mercian Regiment. Based in Wolverhampton, the Band is composed of volunteer musicians that include many from civilian careers. The band undertakes a variety of performances international, national, and local parades/festivals and concerts. In recent years, the band has visited countries such as Cyprus, participated in events like the Buxton Military Tattoo and in 2014, became the first and only reserve band based outside of London to performs during the changing of the Queen&#x27;s Guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James&#x27;s Palace. It also has taken part in the Household Division&#x27;s Beating Retreat on Horse Guards Parade. One of its more notable directors was Captain Anthony Hodgetts, who after rising through the ranks of British Army Bands, served twelve years as Director of Music of the Royal Army of Oman.

On the 1 June 2019, the Mercian Regiment Band led the Tamworth carnival though the town. According to the musicians this was the longest march the band had done to date.

On the 10 October 2019, Mercian Band Bugler Msn Wykes performed the Last Post and Rouse at the National Memorial Arboretum. He then also performed the Last Post and Rouse at the War memorial in St Editha&#x27;s Church Tamworth, Tamworth being the historical capital of Mercia.

==Regimental Museums==
The Mercian Regiment supports four museums that hold collections of the Mercian Regiment and its antecedent regiments:
* The Museum of the Mercian Regiment (WFR Collection) in Nottingham.
* The Staffordshire Regiment Museum in Whittington, Staffordshire.
* The Cheshire Military Museum in Chester.
* The Mercian Regiment Museum (Worcester) in Worcester.

<text>The Royal Welsh (R WELSH) () is an armoured infantry regiment of the British Army. It was established in 2006 from the Royal Welch Fusiliers (23rd Foot) and the Royal Regiment of Wales (24th/41st Foot).

== History ==
The regiment&#x27;s formation was announced on 16 December 2004 by Geoff Hoon and General Sir Mike Jackson as part of the restructuring of the infantry and it was actually formed on St David&#x27;s Day, 1 March 2006. The Royal Welsh initially consisted of two Regular Army battalions, plus an Army Reserve battalion. The former regiments formed part of the battalion title (in brackets):
*1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Welch Fusiliers) (ex 1st Battalion, the Royal Welch Fusiliers (23rd Foot))
*2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) (ex 1st Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Wales (24th/41st Foot))

The 1st battalion deployed to Afghanistan in October 2007, October 2009 and April 2012.

In July 2007 the 2nd battalion deployed to Iraq and between 2009 and 2011 the battalion deployed companies to Afghanistan.

The 2nd battalion merged with 1st battalion to form a single battalion, the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh on 2 April 2014.

== Structure ==
The 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh is a Regular Army armoured infantry battalion based at Tidworth Camp. It comes under 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade with HQ at Bulford Camp in Wiltshire.

The 3rd Battalion, The Royal Welsh is an Army Reserve light infantry battalion based at Maindy Barracks in Cardiff, with company locations in Swansea, Pontypridd, Aberystwyth and Colwyn Bay. Paired with 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh, it also comes under 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade.

== Regimental museum ==
The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh is at The Barracks, Brecon. Meanwhile Firing Line: Cardiff Castle Museum of the Welsh Soldier is based at Cardiff Castle

== Traditions ==
The regiment&#x27;s cap badge is a representation of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers (formerly the cap badge of the Royal Regiment of Wales), while the hackle of the Royal Welch Fusiliers is worn by all NCOs and Other Ranks. Queen Elizabeth II was the new regiment&#x27;s Colonel-in-Chief until her death in September 2022.

The regiment includes a goat, presented by the monarch; this is not a mascot but a ranking soldier. Lance Corporal William Windsor retired on 20 May 2009; a replacement, Fusilier William Windsor, was appointed on 15 June 2009.

== Regimental Band and Corps of Drums of The Royal Welsh ==
The Regimental Band of The Royal Welsh is an all-brass band within the British Army. Formed of 30 soldiers who are all members of the Army Reserve, it can provide a marching band, a concert band or a fanfare team.

In October 2009, due to £54m of Ministry of Defence budget cuts affecting front line services including the war in Afghanistan, all bookings from end of October 2009 until April 2010 were cancelled. This covered the Autumn Rugby Union Internationals and Remembrance Day. Band members agreed to honour all charity appearances during this period, but without pay.

== Regimental Colonels ==
Regimental Colonels have been as follows:
* 2006–2011: Major General Roderick J. M. Porter
* 2011–2016: Brigadier Philip M. L. Napier
* 2016–2021: Lieutenant General James Swift, OBE
*2021–present: Major General Chris Barry
