<text>Cahora-Bassa (previously spelled Cabora Bassa) is a separate bipolar HVDC power transmission line between the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Generation Station at the Cahora Bassa Dam in Mozambique, and Johannesburg, South Africa. 

==History==
The system was built between 1974 and 1979 and can transmit 1920 megawatts at a voltage level of 533 kilovolts DC and 1800 Amperes. Thyristor valves are used, which unlike most other HVDC schemes are mounted outdoors and not in a valve hall. The valves are grouped into eight, 133 kV six-pulse bridges in series at each end. The long powerline runs through inaccessible terrain, so it is mostly built as monopolar lines apart. In case of a single line failure, transmission with reduced power is possible via the surviving pole and return through the earth.


Cahora-Bassa was out of service from 1985 to 1997 because of the Mozambican Civil War in the region. The project was beset with technological challenges, most notable of these being the adoption of solid-state rectification devices in a large-scale commercial installation. Mercury-arc valves had been the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for HVDC up to this time. Cahora Bassa was the first HVDC scheme ordered with thyristor valves, though its operation was delayed. It was also the first HVDC scheme operational in Africa, and the first anywhere in the world to operate above 500 kV. Significant commercial hurdles, culminating in hearings at an International Arbitration Tribunal seated in Lisbon, in 1988, also had to be overcome.

Following a refurbishment exercise, the scheme was put back into commercial operation in October 1997. Between 2006 and 2009 the thyristor valves at the Apollo converter station were replaced by more modern water-cooled thyristor valves.

== Description ==

=== Construction and ownership ===
The Cahora-Bassa transmission project was a joint venture of the two electrical utilities, Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM, as it was known prior to 1987), latterly Eskom, Johannesburg, South Africa and Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), a firm owned 15% by the government of Portugal and 85% by Mozambique. Equipment was constructed and supplied by ZAMCO, which was a consortium of AEG-Telefunken JV, Brown Boveri Company, and Siemens AG of Germany. Brown Boveri subsequently became part of ABB and AEG subsequently became part of Alstom.

The commercial arrangements also included Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) which took supply from Cahora Bassa through a wheeling arrangement with Eskom. Effectively, Eskom supplied southern Mozambique (Maputo) from the then Eastern Transvaal at 132 kV with the sales deducted from the HCB supply to Eskom. The tripartite agreement was suspended due to force majeure when the line from Cahora Bassa was unavailable in the 1980s.

The system was commissioned in three stages starting in March 1977 with four six-pulse bridges, and in full operation of eight bridges on 15 March 1979.

=== Transmission line ===
The power line runs from the Songo converter station, which is near the hydroelectric station and normally operates as a rectifier, to the Apollo converter station near Johannesburg, which normally operates as an inverter. Each of the self-supporting steel towers along the route carries two bundles of four 565 square millimetre (1120 kcmil) cables, and a single 117 square millimetre (231 kcmil) grounding conductor. There are approximately 7,000 towers with an average span of .

The maximum span is using reinforced towers. Earth return for unipolar operation is provided by buried graphite electrodes at each station. The DC line has smoothing reactors and surge arrester capacitors at each station.

Northeast of Apollo Converter Station the poles of HVDC Cahora Bassa undercross several 400 kV AC lines at 25°54&#x27;58&quot;S 28°16&#x27;46&quot;E respectively 25°54&#x27;57&quot;S 28°16&#x27;51&quot;E in such a low altitude that the area under the line may not be walked on and is fenced in .

The two lines are named as Zeus and Apollo respectively.

=== Thyristor valves ===
Cahora Bassa was one of the first HVDC schemes built with thyristor valves from its inception. Unusually, the thyristor valves are outdoor mounted. In the original installation they were oil filled for both cooling and electrical insulation. The only other HVDC scheme in the world equipped in this way from the outset was the first phase – now decommissioned – of the Shin Shinano frequency converter in Japan. Each valve tank contains two valves, forming a &quot;double-valve&quot; connecting the two DC terminals to one single-phase, two-winding converter transformer. Each six-pulse bridge contains three such tanks and hence each station contains 24 double-valves.

The development work for the thyristor valves began in the late 1960s when the only thyristors available at the time were, by today’s standards, small, and were rated only 1.6 kV each. In the first phase of the project (4 bridges at each end) each valve contained 280 such thyristors in series with two in parallel – the largest number ever used in a single HVDC valve.

Phases 2 and 3 used improved thyristors with a rating of 2.4 kV each and only required 192 in series per valve – still a large number by modern standards – with two in parallel. As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656 thyristors.

=== Other equipment ===
The thyristors also had poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual feature of the scheme was the existence of &quot;overcurrent diverters&quot; between the valves and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station.

AC filters tuned to the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics of the 50 Hz power supply are installed at each station, approximately 195 MVAr at Apollo and 210 MVAr at Songo.

There are two PLC repeater stations: one at Gamaboi in South Africa and one at Catope in Mozambique.

==Repairing the war damage==
After the civil war ended in 1992, one of the many effects of the decade of strife was the damage to the HVDC transmission lines. Nearly all of the 4200 transmission line towers located on the of line in Mozambique needed to be replaced or refurbished. This work was started in 1995 and took until late 1997 to complete. The system was restored to full power transmission capacity by 1998.

Subsequently, Eskom has commenced electricity supply to Mozambique at 400 kV, under terms similar to the original wheeling agreement, from the Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, via Swaziland. The principal purpose of this infrastructure is to provide bulk electricity supplies to the Mozal Aluminium Smelter operated by BHP.

The Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 2 November 2007, means that Mozambique will by the end of 2007 be in charge of a project located on its soil but on which it had no control for the past 30 years due to contractual obligations with Portugal.

The new arrangement gives Mozambique 85 percent of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric (HCB) project while Portugal will retain only 15 percent. The project has a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity and is one of the main suppliers of power to the Southern African Power Pool.

Mozambique will, however, need to pay US$950 million to the Portuguese government as compensation for the post civil-war reconstruction and maintenance of the dam.

The civil war resulted in serious damage to the transmission infrastructure, forcing the Portuguese government to pay about US$2.5 billion out of pocket to repair it.

== Apollo station upgrade ==

In 2006 ABB was awarded a contract to replace the thyristor valves at the Apollo station. The outdoor mounting concept was retained, but each of the new housings contains a complete six-pulse bridge instead of only two valves, and the replacement thyristor valves are of a more conventional air insulated, water-cooled design using 125mm, 8.5 kV thyristors. 36 such thyristors are connected in series in each valve, without parallel connection, and the new valves are capable of a subsequent upgrade to 600 kV, 3300 A. At the same time, the AC filters were replaced.

<text>The Cingapura project is a low-cost housing initiative in São Paulo, Brazil. It is designed to try to move the poor population from &quot;favelas&quot; (shanty towns), into more permanent structures. This approach mimicked that of the Housing Development Board (HDB) in Singapore (where over 80% of the population lives in HDB-developed public housing), hence the name &quot;Cingapura&quot; (&quot;Singapore&quot;). These structures are often called &#x27;superblocks&#x27;. 

They were intended to have a supply of electricity, a good water supply and sewer pipes. On top of this, residential security guards were to be employed to reduce crimes which were and are rife throughout the favelas in Brazil. Much of the work was to be done by the residents of the favelas themselves, the project being dubbed a &#x27;self-help&#x27; project. The existing favelas were to be cleared and building materials provided for the builders for free. One of the major difficulties in building on the sites of the favelas was the large slopes on which they are built. This difficult terrain was the only reason the owners of the land did not use it. Levelling the land was very expensive and eventually proved too expensive; only a tenth of the proposed apartments were completed, with the focus being on residents living on marginal land, like floodplains.

Some residents are not happy with the way the project has developed. Many of the towers were not completed, leaving a skyline of half-finished buildings and empty shacks. Some residents are very frustrated at the way the government have treated them. Many have moved away, or committed suicide. Also, many artisans who could practice their craft in a more free environment could not do so, as the buildings were closely controlled by the owners.

Those that were built were not very successful, as many of the families from the favelas found that the new apartments were too much of a change of environment. They did not like the fact they couldn&#x27;t extend on their new apartments, and many attempted to bring their livestock into the flats. Only 14,000 of the 140,000 projected apartments were actually built. Recently, a reported 6,000 apartments are likely to be built.

<text>Terri Kathleen Nunn (born June 26, 1961) is an American singer and actress. She is known as the vocalist of the 1980s new wave and synth-pop band Berlin.

==Biography==
Nunn was born in Los Angeles, California on June 26, 1961. Her father Larry Nunn (1925–1974) was a painter and a former contract child actor for MGM (&quot;Men of Boys Town&quot;, &quot;The Major and the Minor&quot;). He was an alcoholic and died by suicide in 1974 when she was 13 years old. Her mother Joy appeared in her music video for &quot;Sex (I&#x27;m a ...)&quot;.

In 1976, Nunn auditioned for the role of Princess Leia in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Later that year, Nunn posed nude for &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, convincing the magazine that she was legally an adult, with the pictorial appearing in 1977 under a pseudonym. For many years, Nunn denied her participation as the photos were taken when she was a minor.

She joined Berlin in 1978 and temporarily left the group the following year to pursue an acting career. Nunn acted in numerous television shows in the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;T.J. Hooker&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot; and &quot;James at 15&quot;. Nunn also appeared in the 1978 ensemble film &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot;.

In 1981, she rejoined Berlin as the lead vocalist and soon forged her recording career in the band. Her greatest success in Berlin was the top-selling 1986 single &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, the theme song for the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. It reached the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She sang other popular songs with Berlin, including &quot;Sex (I&#x27;m a ...),&quot; &quot;The Metro,&quot; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know,&quot; &quot;No More Words,&quot; and &quot;Masquerade.&quot;

In 1985, Nunn briefly dated Michael Hutchence, whom she met at an INXS concert in London while Berlin were recording the album &quot;Count Three &amp; Pray&quot;. The relationship ended when INXS returned to Australia.

In 1985, Nunn left Berlin and recorded the song &quot;Dancing in Isolation&quot; for the film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;. In 1989, she performed a duet with Paul Carrack called &quot;Romance&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Sing&quot;.

In 1991, she recorded and released a solo album entitled &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, in association with David Z, Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park producer.

In 1993, she approached lead singer Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy with a recording of her vocal on a Billie Hughes song which led to their collaboration and ultimately became The Sisters of Mercy single &quot;Under the Gun.&quot;

Nunn obtained usage rights to the band name &quot;Berlin&quot; in 1996, and reformed that band with new members, who began recording and touring. Berlin released two EPs &quot;Fall into Heaven&quot; and &quot;Fall into Heaven 2&quot; in 1999, followed by &quot;&quot; in 2000, their first live album. &quot;Voyeur&quot; hit shelves in 2002. &quot;4Play&quot; (2005) contains original songs and cover versions of some of the band&#x27;s songs.

In 2003, Berlin’s original lineup reunited for the VH1 series &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;.

In 2008, Nunn contributed sex and dating advice to Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna&#x27;s book &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;.

Nunn sang across the United States on the 2009 Regeneration Tour, which also featured Martin Fry of ABC, Wang Chung, and Cutting Crew.

In 2010, Nunn appeared as a guest judge on season two of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, mentoring the contestants in a rock-themed singing challenge.

Nunn co-hosts &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;, a popular podcast on webcast media station Hottalkla.com.

In January 2012, Nunn debuted her radio show on KCSN-FM. It features interviews and live performances.

Nunn performed at a 2020 New Year&#x27;s Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, later expressing regret for performing at the event. Some fans expressed loud discontent towards her (including ex band members) after this performance. They stated that it was outrageous to perform at a Trump-owned resort, and that his blatant disregard for mask mandates should have been taken into account and should have been grounds for her to refuse playing the show.

=== Personal life ===
Nunn is married to attorney Paul Spear. In 2004, she adopted a baby who had been born in Russia and named her Natalie Joy. She also has two stepsons from her husband. The family has lived in Santa Rosa Valley, California, since 2012. Her cousin is Pamela Moore, also a singer, who has performed with Queensrÿche.

Nunn is a vegan. She became a vegetarian at age 19, then began eating fish in her 20s, before becoming a vegan in her 40s.

<doc id="1277184" wikidata="Q264054" url="?curid=1277184" title="Skagerrak (power transmission system)">
<text>Skagerrak is the name of a 1,700 MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission facility between Tjele (Denmark) and Kristiansand (Norway). It is owned and operated by Statnett in Norway, and Energinet in Denmark. The lines connect the hydroelectric-based Norwegian grid and the wind and thermal power-based Danish grid. In operation it enables more renewable energy in the energy mix, and more efficient use of electricity.

==Technical features==
The Skagerrak 1–3 scheme consists of a overhead line and a underwater cable. It has a capacity of 1,050 megawatts (MW). Both land parts in Denmark and in Norway uses overhead lines from the cable landing point to the converter stations. The overhead lines in Denmark are set to be renovated in 2016 for increased lifespan. The towers were originally constructed for four poles, but were rebuilt for three conductors (three poles) when Skagerrak 3 was established. Near Aggersund HVDC Skagerrak crossed Aggersund strait overhead on towers with a span, but were later converted to underground cables. The pylons of this span were the tallest electricity pylons of an HVDC line in Europe.

For such a long submarine cable, an AC transmission scheme would not be feasible since too much of the cable&#x27;s capacity would be consumed by the capacitance of the cable itself, and the power systems in Norway and Jutland are not synchronous.

The transmission has a loss rate of 4%.

The waste heat of the transformers is enough to supply district heating economically for 1,000 homes in nearby towns, but taxes prevent that project. The adjacent Apple Datacenter (supplied in part by the Skagerrak cables via Tjele) was expected to work around the tax issue when supplying district heat to Viborg.

===Skagerrak 1 and 2===
Skagerrak went in service in 1977 as a bipolar HVDC scheme. This facility was built with thyristor valves. When installed this underwater cable was the world&#x27;s longest and deepest underwater HVDC power cable. The cable, manufactured by Alcatel, is laid in a maximum water depth of .

Both cables have a capacity of 250 MW at 250 kV.

===Skagerrak 3===
In 1993 the scheme was extended by HVDC Skagerrak 3. Skagerrak 3 is a monopolar line for a voltage of 350 kV with a capacity of 440 MW at 350 kV. In installing Skagerrak 3, the old poles Skagerrak 1 and Skagerrak 2 were converted to monopolar HVDC schemes, which run with opposite polarity to Skagerrak 3. In 1999, the full 1,000 MW capacity was reserved by large power companies.

===Skagerrak 4===
In November 2009, Statnett and Energinet.dk signed the agreement to construct Skagerrak 4. The capacity of Skagerrak 4 is approximately 700 MW with a DC voltage of 500 kV. It had been in a test phase since 1 October 2014 and became operational at the end of 2014, when strong winds created negative prices despite the new connection. It was officially inaugurated by Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark and Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway on 12 March 2015. As for the existing Skagerrak 1-3, the grid connection points are Kristiansand and Tjele. Differently from Skagerrak 1–3, for Skagerrak 4 a cable solution is chosen for the complete route length. The 300 million DKK Prysmian land cable on the Danish side is approximately , while the subsea cable and the Norwegian land cable is to be made by Nexans for 638 million DKK. Converter stations were built by ABB, as for Skagerrak 1–3. The combined budget is 2.8-3.2 billion DKK.

The technology used was VSC, capable of black start. Although thyristor-based converters have a loss of only 0.7%, the IGBTs of VSC get close with a loss of 0.8 to 1%. Skagerrak 1 and 2 previously used Skagerrak 3 as a return cable, but 1 and 2 were again coupled so that Skagerrak 4 can use number 3 for returns. The cable also supplies 110 MW of reserve power. Some of the 24 fiber pairs may be rented for business by telecommunications companies.

<doc id="1277185" wikidata="Q10526473" url="?curid=1277185" title="Lexicon (game)">
<text>Lexicon is a computer-assisted role-playing game invented by Neel Krishnaswami and popularised by the indie role-playing game community. As originally proposed, it is played online using wiki software. Players assume the role of scholars who write the history and background of a particular fictitious time, setting, or incident. As the game goes on, the players collaboratively create an elaborately interwoven account.

Each game is a series of 26 turns, keyed to the letters of the alphabet from A to Z. On the first turn, each player must write an Encyclopedia-style entry beginning with the letter A, citing and linking to two entries that are not yet written. These are called &quot;undefined&quot; entries. Undefined entries must begin with a letter later in the alphabet.

The 25 subsequent turns proceed consecutively through the letters of the alphabet, one letter per turn. In a turn, each player writes one entry that begins with the turn&#x27;s specified letter. If one or more undefined entries are available that begin with the letter, a player must choose and write an undefined entry before any new entries can be created under that letter. A new entry must create and link to two undefined entries, and must also link to an entry written on a previous turn. Near the endgame, when sufficient undefined entries exist to occupy all players for the remainder of the game, no new undefined entries may be created.

Many variants exist, such as covering two or three letters per turn, or starting each player on a different letter. Some games permit other players to post comments or expansions of earlier entries. The optional &quot;Rule of X&quot; treats X (or any other appropriate letter) as a wild card; entries for the X turn may begin with any letter. &quot;Telephone pad&quot; is a shorter variant with 8 turns (corresponding to the letters on a telephone keypad) instead of 26 turns (one per letter of the alphabet).

<doc id="1277186" wikidata="Q5002173" url="?curid=1277186" title="Buster Olney">
<text>Robert Stanbury &quot;Buster&quot; Olney III (born ) is an American sports journalist for ESPN, &quot;ESPN: The Magazine&quot;, and ESPN.com. He previously covered the New York Giants and New York Yankees for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He is also a regular analyst for the ESPN&#x27;s television program &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; and hosts ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; daily podcast.

==Early life and education==
Olney was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up on a dairy farm in Randolph Center, Vermont. He was educated at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Gill, Massachusetts, and Vanderbilt University, where he majored in history. As a child Olney was an avid baseball fan. At age eight, he developed an affinity for the Los Angeles Dodgers after reading a book about Sandy Koufax. Olney would later attribute his fanship as a reason for his journalistic career.

==Journalism career==
===Print===
After graduation, Olney began covering baseball in 1989, as the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;&#x27;s beat reporter assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. While in Nashville, he formed a close relationship with Don Meyer, head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball program at David Lipscomb University. He later worked at the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. He arrived at the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1997 and in his first year won an Associated Press award.

During one of his first assignments in Nashville, the Sounds hosted the Columbus Clippers who, at the time, were the AAA affiliate of the New York Yankees. Olney almost had a minor confrontation with a Yankee prospect at the time known more for his football play, Deion Sanders. Olney had attempted to do a piece on Sanders, but was blown off. In return, Olney wrote what he called later in his career an unflattering piece on Sanders. Sanders replied to Olney by writing on a baseball &quot;Keep writing like that your whole life and you&#x27;ll always be a loser.&quot;

===&quot;The Last Night of the Yankees Dynasty&quot;===
In 2004, Olney published &quot;The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty&quot;, , a nonfiction account of the Yankees&#x27; run of championships in the 1990s. The book also considered why the team lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2001 World Series and why it didn&#x27;t win a championship between 2001 and 2003. Since leaving the &quot;Times&quot;, Olney has become a constant on the ESPN family of networks.

===&quot;How Lucky You Can Be: The Story of Coach Don Meyer&quot;===
In 2010, Olney wrote &quot;How Lucky You Can Be: The Story of Coach Don Meyer&quot;, an account of how a car crash and cancer diagnosis affected the life of the highly accomplished college basketball coach. In 2013, Olney delivered the May commencement speech at Northern State University, where Meyer coached until 2010, and was still a member of the faculty until his death on May 18, 2014.
==Personal life==
Olney resides in Yorktown Heights, New York.

<doc id="1277197" wikidata="Q2743328" url="?curid=1277197" title="Islam in Saudi Arabia">
<text>Islam is the state religion of Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is called the &quot;home of Islam&quot;; it was the birthplace of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who united and ruled the Arabian Peninsula. It is the location of the cities of Mecca and Medina, where Prophet Muhammad lived and died, and are now the two holiest cities of Islam. The kingdom attracts millions of Muslim Hajj pilgrims annually, and thousands of clerics and students who come from across the Muslim world to study. The official title of the King of Saudi Arabia is &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot;—the two being Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and Al-Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina—which are considered the holiest in Islam.

In the 18th century, a pact between Islamic preacher Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and a regional emir, Muhammad bin Saud, brought a revival of Islam (Salafism - that is, following the Quran and Sunnah in light of the interpretation of ‘As Salaf As Salih’) of Sunni Islam first to the Najd region and then to the Arabian Peninsula. Referred to by supporters as &quot;Salafism&quot; and by others as &quot;Wahhabism&quot;, this interpretation of Islam became the state religion and interpretation of Islam espoused by Muhammad bin Saud and his successors (the Al Saud family), who eventually created the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. The Saudi government has spent tens of billions of dollars of its petroleum export revenue throughout the Islamic world and elsewhere on building mosques, publishing books, giving scholarships and fellowships, hosting international Islamic organisations, and promoting its form of Islam, sometimes referred to as &quot;petro-Islam&quot;.

The mission to call to Islam the way the Salaf practiced it has been dominant in Najd for two hundred years, but in most other parts of the country—Hejaz, the Eastern Province, Najran—it has dominated only since 1913–1925. Most of the 15 to 20 million Saudi citizens are Sunni Muslims, while the eastern regions are populated mostly by Twelver Shia, and there are Zaydi Shia in the southern regions. According to a number of sources, only a minority of Saudis consider themselves Wahhabis, although according to other sources, the Wahhabi affiliation is up to 40%, making it a very dominant minority, at the very least using a native population of 17 million based on &quot;2008–09 estimates&quot;. In addition, the next largest affiliation is with Salafism, which encompasses all of the central principles of Islam, with a number of minor additional accepted principles differentiating the two. In a 2014 survey, conducted for the Boston Consultancy Group report on Saudi youth, it was found that 97% of the young Saudis consider Islam &quot;as the main influence that shapes their identity.&quot;

Public worship and proselytising by non-Muslims, including the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials (such as the Bible), is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Non-Muslim foreigners attempting to acquire Saudi Arabian nationality must convert to Islam.

Starting in late 2017, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, dramatic changes have been made in religious policy, including the elimination of the power of the religious police, the lifting of bans on amusement parks, cinemas, concert venues, and driving of motor vehicles by women.

==History==

The Islamic prophet, Muhammad, was born in Mecca in about 570. From the early 7th century, Muhammad united the various tribes of the peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity under his rule. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia and conquered many parts of Asia, Africa and Europe conquering huge swathes of territory. Although Arabia soon became a politically peripheral region as the focus shifted to the more developed conquered lands, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qur&#x27;an requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime.

From the 9th century, a number of Shia sects developed particularly in the eastern part of Arabia. These included the Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili sect led by Abū-Tāhir Al-Jannābī who attacked and sacked Mecca in 930.

===Al Saud and ibn Abd al-Wahhab===
In 1744, in the desert region of Nejd, Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the Al Saud dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was the founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam. This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. The first &quot;Saudi state&quot; established in 1744 in the area around Riyadh, rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia, but was destroyed by 1818 by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha. In 1824, a much smaller second &quot;Saudi state&quot;, located mainly in Nejd, was established in 1824, but by 1891 its Al Saud rulers were driven into exile in Kuwait.

At the beginning of the 20th century, a third attempt was made to conquer this territory by another Al-Saud, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. He gained the support of the Ikhwan, a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by Sultan ibn Bijad and Faisal Al-Dawish, which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912. With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured al-Hasa from the Ottoman Empire in 1913.

Ibn Saud defeated a rival ruling family and took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921.
By this time the Ottomans had been defeated in World War I, and Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia was no more. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25. Following this victory however the Ikhwan clashed with Ibn Saud. He opposed their raiding the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait, to expand of the Wahhabist realm, and they opposed his policies of allowing some modernization and some non-Muslim foreigners in the country. The Ikhwan were defeated and their leaders executed in 1930 after a two-year struggle. In 1932 the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the &quot;Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&quot;.

=== Era of oil exports ===
Commercial quantities of oil were discovered in the Persian Gulf region of Saudi Arabia in 1938, and the kingdom&#x27;s oil wells eventually revealed the largest source of crude oil in the world. For the king, oil revenues became a crucial source of wealth since he no longer had to rely on receipts from pilgrimages to Mecca. This discovery would alter Middle Eastern political relations forever.

During the 1960s and &#x27;70s, religious authorities allowed some practices that had previously been forbidden (haram). At the urging of the government and after vigorous debate, religious authorities allowed the use of paper money in 1951, abolished slavery in 1962, permitted the education of females in 1964, and use of television in 1965.

By the 1970s, as a result of oil wealth and government modernization policies, economic and social development progressed at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed.

By 1976, Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world. The power of the ulema was in decline.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, this trend was reversed. In 1979, the modernizing monarch of Iran, despite his oil revenues and apparently formidable security apparatus, was overthrown by an Islamic revolution. The new revolutionary Islamic Republic was across the Persian Gulf from Saudi oil fields and across from where most of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s minority Shiites—co-religionists of Iran who also often worked in the oil industry—lived. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region in 1979 and 1980.

Also alarming to the government was the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government, proclaimed the return of the Mahdi.
The takeover and siege of the mosque lasted for nearly two weeks, during which the mosque was severely damaged and several hundred militants, soldiers, and hostages were killed.

In response, the royal family enforced much stricter observances of traditional religious and social norms in the country and gave the Ulema a greater role in government. At first, photographs of women in newspapers were banned, then women on television. Cinemas and music shops were shut down. School curriculum was changed to provide many more hours of religious studies, eliminating classes on subjects like non-Islamic history. Gender segregation was extended &quot;to the humblest coffee shop&quot;. The religious police became more assertive.

Greater emphasis was put on religion in the media (increased religious programming on television and radio, and an increase in articles about religion in newspapers), in individual behavior, in government policies, and in mosque sermons. In 1986 King Fahd replaced his title &quot;His Majesty&quot; with &quot;Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques&quot;. The ulema&#x27;s powers and financial support were strengthened in particular, they were given greater control over the education system and allowed to enforce stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour. These policies did not succeed in dampening the growth and strength of religious conservatives dissatisfied with the royal family.

Saudi Islamism gained momentum following 1991 Gulf War. The presence of U.S. troops on Saudi soil from 1991 onwards was deeply unpopular with conservative Saudis and one of the major issues that has led to an increase in Islamist terrorism by Saudis inside and out of Saudi Arabia, (the 9/11 attacks in New York being the most prominent example).

Islamist terrorist activity increased dramatically in 2003, with the Riyadh compound bombings and other attacks, which prompted the government to take much more stringent action against terrorism. The king (Abdullah) has also taken steps to rein back the powers of the ulema, for instance transferring their control over girls&#x27; education to the Ministry of Education.
Some have complained that the king&#x27;s dominance over the ulema has weakened the traditional Islamic legitimacy of Saudi throne.

===Pre-MbS era===
====Role in the state and society====

Islam plays a central role in Saudi society. It has been said that Islam is more than a religion, it is a way of life in Saudi Arabia, and, as a result, the influence of the ulema, the religious establishment, is all-pervasive. Article one of the 1992 Saudi &quot;Basic Law of Governance&quot; states,
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a sovereign Arab Islamic State. Its religion is Islam. Its constitution is Almighty God&#x27;s Book, The Holy Qur&#x27;an, and the Sunna (Traditions) of the Prophet (PBUH). Arabic is the language of the Kingdom. 

Unlike most Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia gives the ulema direct involvement in government, and fields a specifically &quot;religious&quot; police force, called the &quot;Haia&quot;. (Iran gives the ulema much more influence and also has a religious police.) According to Robert Baer, this power is only over certain sectors of governance. The founder of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud, established a division of power (according to Baer) with the Wahhabi religious establishment in 1932. In &quot;return for allowing it control of the mosques, culture, and education&quot;, the ulema or religious establishment &quot;would never go near core political issues, such as royal succession, foreign policy, and the armed forces.&quot; This agreement has &quot;been more or less respected&quot; since 1932. Historians note that in his alliance with the House of Saud, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab called for the state to have an &quot;imam&quot; (religious leader, himself) and an &quot;emir&quot; (military leader, Ibn Saud). However, the third head of the House of Saud used the title &quot;Imam&quot;, and Saudi kings have served in this role since.

A Council of Senior Scholars, appointed and paid by the government advises the king on religious matters. The ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions, have a significant role in the judicial and education systems and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals. Not only is the succession to the throne subject to the approval of the ulema, but so are all new laws (royal decrees).

The religious police or Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice numbers 3,500-4,000. Members patrol the streets enforcing dress codes, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, investigating reports of witchcraft, and other behavior it believes to be commanded or forbidden by Islam.

Daily life in Saudi Arabia is dominated by Islamic observance. Five times each day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques scattered throughout the country. Because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims, the weekend begins on Thursday. In accordance with Salafi doctrine, only two religious holidays are publicly recognized, &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot; and &quot;Eid al-Adha&quot;. Celebration of other Islamic holidays, such as the Prophet&#x27;s birthday and Day of Ashura are tolerated only when celebrated locally and on a small scale. Public observance of non-Islamic religious holidays is prohibited, with the exception of 23 September, which commemorates the unification of the kingdom. Conformity of behavior is highly valued as part of religion, apparent in sameness of dress. Almost all women wear a loose-fitting black abaya cloak covering all but their eyes and hands, almost all men wear a white thawb with a red and white checkered headdress.

Sharia, or Islamic law, is the basis of the legal system in Saudi Arabia. It is unique not only compared to Western systems, but also compared to other Muslim countries, as (according to its supporters) the Saudi model is closest to the form of law originally developed when Islam became established in the Arabian peninsula in the 7th century.

The Saudi courts impose a number of severe physical punishments. The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder, rape, armed robbery, repeated drug use, apostasy, adultery, witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword, stoning or firing squad, followed by crucifixion.

====Wahhabism====
Many of the strict and unique practices in Saudi Arabia mentioned above come from Wahhabism, (formerly) the official and dominant form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia, named after the preacher and scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. (Proponents consider the name derogatory, preferring the term Salafiyya, after the early Muslims known as the Salaf.) This interpretation is often described as &#x27;puritanical&#x27;, &#x27;intolerant&#x27; or &#x27;ultra-conservative&#x27;, however proponents believe its teachings seek to purify the practise of Islam of any innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh-century teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions. According to one anti-Wahhabi source (Stephen Schwartz), &quot;no more than&quot; 40% of Saudi nationals consider themselves Wahhabis.

The message of the school was the essential oneness of God (&quot;tawhid&quot;). The movement is therefore known by its adherents as &quot;ad dawa lil tawhid&quot; (the call to unity), and those who follow the call are known as &quot;ahl at tawhid&quot; (the people of unity) or &quot;muwahhidun&quot; (unitarians). The school puts an emphasis on following of the Athari school of thought. Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, was influenced by the writings of Ibn Taymiyya and questioned the philosophical interpretations of Islam within the Ash&#x27;ari and Maturidi schools, claiming to rely on the Qur&#x27;an and the Hadith without speculative philosophy so as to not transgress beyond the limits of the early Muslims known as the Salaf. Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab attacked a &quot;perceived moral decline and political weakness&quot; in the Arabian Peninsula and condemned what he perceived as idolatry, the popular cult of saints, and shrine and tomb visitation.

In the 1990s, Saudi leadership did not emphasize its identity as inheritor of the Wahhabi legacy as such, nor did the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, the Al ash Shaykh, continue to hold the highest posts in the religious bureaucracy. Wahhabi influence in Saudi Arabia, however, remained tangible in the physical conformity in dress, in public deportment, and in public prayer. Most significantly, the Wahhabi legacy was manifest in the social ethos that presumed government responsibility for the collective moral ordering of society, from the behavior of individuals, to institutions, to businesses, to the government itself.

===New MbS era (2017–present)===
Under the rule of Muhammad bin Salman (MbS), (who became Crown Prince in June 2017 and is the de facto ruler of the Kingdom), dramatic changes have been made whereby activities once allowed are now forbidden and others forbidden in the name of religion (i.e. Wahhabism) are allowed.

====Secular policy changes====
The formerly powerful religious police, who busied themselves enforcing strict rules on everything from hijab (which in Saudi Arabia meant covering all of the body except the hands and eyes), segregation of the sexes, and daily prayer attendance; to preventing the sale of dogs and cats, Barbie dolls, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and Valentine&#x27;s Day gifts, are now banned &quot;from pursuing, questioning, asking for identification, arresting and detaining anyone suspected of a crime&quot;. The punishments of flogging and the death penalty for crimes committed by minors are no longer allowed.

Among the bans lifted are on women driving motor vehicles (June 2018), (some) activities by women without the permission of male-guardians (August 2019), cinemas, musical performances—including public concerts by female singers, admission of women to sports stadiums, employment of women in many parts of the workforce, and international tourism.

====Theology====
MbS has stated, &quot;in Islamic law, the head of the Islamic establishment is &quot;wali al-amr&quot;, (Arabic:ولي الأمر) the ruler.&quot; While the ruling kings (and Crown Princes) of Saudi Arabia &quot;have historically stayed away from religion&quot;, and &quot;outsourced&quot; issues of theology and religious law to &quot;the big beards&quot;, (traditionally conservative and orthodox religious scholars), MbS has &quot;a law degree from King Saud University&quot;. He is &quot;probably the only leader in the Arab world who knows anything about Islamic epistemology and jurisprudence&quot;, according to (secular) scholar of Islamic law, Bernard Haykel.
In an interview televised in Saudi Arabia on April 25, 2021, MbS criticized the devotion of Saudi religious leaders to Wahhabism (i.e. to the doctrines based on 18th century preacher Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab) &quot;in language never before used by a Saudi monarch&quot;, saying, &quot;there are no fixed schools of thought and there is no infallible person.&quot;

But MbS has gone beyond criticism of Wahhabism to question the basis of orthodox Islamic law. Fatwas (legal rulings on points of Islamic law), he says &quot;should be based on the time, place and mindset in which they are issued&quot;, rather than regarded as immutable.
In interviews with Wood, MbS
explained that Islamic law is based on two textual sources: the Quran and the Sunnah, or the example of the Prophet Muhammad, gathered in many tens of thousands of fragments from the Prophet&#x27;s life and sayings. Certain rules—not many—come from the unambiguous legislative content of the Quran, he said, and he cannot do anything about them even if he wants to. But those sayings of the Prophet (called Hadith), he explained, do not all have equal value as sources of law,
According to Chiara Pellegrino,
MBS specified that in the Kingdom &quot;a punishment must be applied only in the presence of a clear Qur&#x27;anic stipulation or a &quot;mutawātir hadīth&quot;,&quot; i.e., a saying of the Prophet of Islam, transmitted over the centuries through an uninterrupted and numerically significant chain of transmitters. As the prince explains, these hadīths are binding, unlike &quot;ahādī hadīth&quot; (i.e., transmitted by single narrators), which become binding only when they are corroborated by Qur&#x27;anic verse, and &quot;khabar hadīth&quot; (stories whose core is identical across different versions but that vary in their details and formulation), whose authenticity is doubtful and which therefore cannot be invoked as sources of law, even if they can be useful for personal edification.
Wood estimates that this will mean &quot;about 95 percent&quot; of traditional Islamic law is &quot;chuck[ed] into the sandpit of Saudi history&quot;, and leave MbS free to use his discretion &quot;to determine what is in the interest of the Muslim community.&quot; According to Haykel this short-circuits centuries of Islamic legal tradition, but is done &quot;in an Islamic way.&quot;

One part of the fallout is in legal code. Unlike most countries, Saudi &quot;does not have any penal and civil code&quot; and &quot;judges rule on the basis of Islamic jurisprudence with a high level of discretion in some contexts&quot;. But as of early 2021, MbS has &quot;ordered a codification of Saudi laws&quot; that would take this power away from judges.

====Reactions====
The policies of MbS have been called a &quot;sidelining of Islamic law&quot; that will &quot;drastically&quot; change the Kingdom.

According to David Ottaway of the Wilson Center, MbS has sidelined Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Wahhabi scholars and preachers &quot;who still command millions of followers in the country and beyond&quot;, and this presents a &quot;particularly risky&quot; move. Journalist Graeme Wood who traveled in Saudi Arabia and interviewed MbS,
noted that Salman al-Ouda, &quot;a preacher with a massive following&quot;, appears to have originally been imprisoned for expressing the relatively benign hope that MbS and the ruler of Qatar (Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani), reconcile—&quot;May God harmonize between their hearts, for the good of their people.&quot; al-Ouda remains in prison facing execution despite the fact that MbS and Al Thani did reconcile.

Many conservative clerics strongly appear to have taken heed, succumbing to &quot;good old-fashioned intimidation&quot;, reversing their religious positions and supporting the government line on issues such as &quot;the opening of cinemas and mass layoffs of Wahhabi imams&quot;. Islamic legal scholar Khaled Abou El Fadl reported in 2019 that Saudi Islamic scholars Salman al-Ouda, Saleh Al-Fawzan, Safar al-Hawali, and Awad al-Qarni, were all incarcerated.

Khaled Abou El Fadl laments the pressure MbS has placed on senior Islamic scholars such as Abdelaziz Al-Shaykh, and the capitulation of the scholars. 

But it also &quot;isn&#x27;t clear how quickly&quot; the modernization of MbS &quot;is catching on&quot;, and that in some instances ordinary police &quot;have stood up&quot; to take the place of religious police, while in at least the very conservative parts of the country, genders still spontaneously segregate themselves in large gatherings.

==== Impact of COVID-19 pandemic ====

As a result of mass shutdowns on in-person business triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, merchants and buyers of Islamic animal sacrifice livestock in the Kingdom shifted much of their business to new emerging online e-commerce platforms, in preparation for Eid al-Adha in July 2021.

==Non-Salafi Islam==
The Wahhabi mission has been dominant in most of the central region of Najd—its &quot;heartland&quot;—for two hundred years, but in most other parts of the country it has dominated only since 1913–1925. The eastern region has many Twelver Shias, the southern regions of Saudi Arabia has many Zaydi Shias. The hijaz region has long had a more pluralistic tradition. The southwest region of Asir is known for its followers of a local leader, Idris, revered by many as a Sufi saint, a concept which Wahhbism opposes. Two critics of Wahhabism (Ali Al-Ahmed and Stephen Schwartz), also give a relatively high estimate of the non-Wahhabi population of Saudi Arabia—over 60%.

=== Sunni Islam ===
Although Wahabism is a strand of Sunni Islam, the promotion of non-Salafi-Sunnism is somewhat restricted but not by the law.

=== Shi&#x27;ism ===

An estimated 5–10% of citizens in Saudi Arabia are Shia Muslims, most of whom are adherents to Twelver Shia Islam. Twelvers are predominantly represented by the Baharna community living in the Eastern Province, with the largest concentrations in Qatif, and half the population in al-Hasa. In addition there is a small Twelver Shia minority in Medina (called the Nakhawila). Sizable and Isma&#x27;ili communities also live in Najran along the border with Yemen.

Shia, human rights groups and other observers have complained of &quot;systematic discrimination&quot; of Shia in Saudi Arabia &quot;in religion, education, justice, and employment&quot;. Unlike other countries with sizable Shia populations (such as Iraq and Lebanon), Saudi Arabia has no Shia cabinet ministers, mayors or police chiefs. Shia are kept out of &quot;critical jobs&quot; in the armed forces and the security services, and not one of the three hundred Shia girls schools in the Eastern Province has a Shia principal. In the Eastern provinces of Saudi Arabia there are Shia courts who deal with cases such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. Shia demonstrations in Qatif have sometimes led to conflict with Sunni Saudi religious authorities who disapprove of Shia commemorations marking the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali by Yazid I. There also Shias living in Southern Saudi Arabia, who are mostly from the Zaydi branch.

==Islamic pilgrimage==

Saudi Arabia, and specifically Mecca and Medina, in Hejaz are the cradle of Islam, and the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world. One of the King&#x27;s titles is Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the two mosques being Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, which contains Islam&#x27;s most sacred place (the Kaaba) and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina which contains Muhammad&#x27;s tomb.

The Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, occurs annually between the first and tenth days of the last month of the Muslim year, Dhul Hajj. The Hajj represents the culmination of the Muslim&#x27;s spiritual life. For many, it is a lifelong ambition. From the time of embarking on the journey to make the Hajj, pilgrims often experience a spirit of exaltation and excitement; the meeting of so many Muslims of all races, cultures, and stations in life in harmony and equality moves many people deeply. Certain rites of pilgrimage may be performed any time, and although meritorious, these constitute a lesser pilgrimage, known as umrah.
The Ministry of Pilgrimage Affairs and Religious Trusts handles the immense logistical and administrative problems generated by such a huge international gathering. The government issues special pilgrimage visas that permit the pilgrim to visit Mecca and to make the customary excursion to Medina to visit the Prophet&#x27;s tomb. Care is taken to assure that pilgrims do not remain in the kingdom after the Hajj to search for work.

An elaborate guild of specialists assists the Hajjis. Guides (mutawwifs) who speak the pilgrim&#x27;s language make the necessary arrangements in Mecca and instruct the pilgrim in the proper performance of rituals; assistants (wakils) provide subsidiary services. Separate groups of specialists take care of pilgrims in Medina and Jiddah. Water drawers (zamzamis) provide water drawn from the sacred well.

Since the late 1980s, the Saudis have been particularly energetic in catering to the needs of pilgrims. In 1988, a US$15 billion traffic improvement scheme for the holy sites was launched. The improvement initiative resulted partly from Iranian charges that the Saudi government was incompetent to guard the holy sites after a 1987 clash between demonstrating Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police left 400 people dead. A further disaster occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated or were crushed to death in one of the new air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels built to shield pilgrims from the heat. The incident resulted from the panic that erupted in the overcrowded and inadequately ventilated tunnel, and further fueled Iranian claims that the Saudis did not deserve to be in sole charge of the holy places. In 1992, however, 114,000 Iranian pilgrims, close to the usual level, participated in the Hajj.

==Islam and politics==
===Islamic legitimacy===
The religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, led by the Al ash-Sheikh, which influences almost every aspect of social life, is deeply involved in politics. It has long been fractured into at least two distinct groups, with the senior ulema closely tied to the political agenda of the House of Saud. A younger generation of ulema, who are less firmly established and more radical in tone, have openly criticized the senior ulema and the government in the past. Fractures between the government and this younger generation deepened in May 2003, when Riyadh fired or suspended thousands of them. Many were to be &quot;re-educated,&quot; while others were simply ousted from the religious establishment. The move did little to endear the government to an already frustrated and religiously radical cadre of clerics.The Islamic legitimacy of the modern Saudi state has been questioned by many radical Islamist groups and individuals including Al-Qaeda.

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s grand mufti, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, has defended the religious establishment&#x27;s legitimacy in a public forum, while responding to mounting criticism of the religious leadership&#x27;s close political alliance with the ruling House of Saud. During a question-and-answer session with members of the public and the media, Al Al-Sheikh denied that the government influenced fatwas (religious rulings) and said accusations to the contrary within the media were false:

Both the criticism and the public response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom&#x27;s religious establishment, but also among the public. It is significant that the question was asked and answered in a public forum, and then reprinted in the media—including the Arabic and English language newspapers. Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom&#x27;s religious, political and perhaps military leaderships becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.

That Al Al-Sheikh answered the question about government influence over fatwas so openly is a clear indicator that the public has growing concerns about the legitimacy of religious leaders. Also, that the statements were reprinted in the press signals that the Saudi government—which wields enormous influence over the local press—is moving to respond to the charges of undue influence and corruption and illegitimacy.

<text>The Inga–Shaba EHVDC Intertie (officially: The Inga–Shaba Extra High Voltage D.C. Intertie; nickname: Inga–Shaba and also referred to as Inga–Kolwezi) is a -long high-voltage direct current overhead electric power transmission line in the Democratic Republic of Congo, linking the Inga hydroelectric complex at the mouth of the Congo River to mineral fields in Shaba (Katanga). It was primarily constructed by Morrison-Knudsen International, an American engineering company, with the converter equipment supplied by ASEA. Construction was completed in 1982 and it cost US$900 million. The scheme was, for many years, the longest HVDC line in the world.

==History==
The Inga–Shaba HVDC represented one of the United States&#x27; most important third world commitments of the 1970s and 1980s. However, construction progress was plagued by rebel insurgency in Southern Zaire, massive logistical challenges, large cost overruns, and financing delays.

By utilizing the hydroelectric potential of the Inga Dam and by constructing one switching station near Kinshasa at Selo, the Government of Zaire under Mobutu Sese Seko was theoretically able to control the flow of power to secession-prone Katanga, then Shaba, province, but never actually exercised this option. It was reported in &quot;La Libre Belgique&quot;, a Brussels newspaper, that Tractionel, a Belgian electrical contractor, had argued that more economical alternatives were available nearer Shaba, using low-head generator plants, but had been overlooked in favor of the American consortium, consisting of Morrison-Knudsen International as a prime contractor, and Swedish ASEA, Italian Sadelmi-Cogepi and Irish GE subsidiary as sub-contractors.

The project was initially conceived as a US$250 million contract - but cost overruns, partly due to unanticipated armed conflict in Shaba Province, pushed the final price up over US$1 billion, with unofficial estimates ranging as high as US$1.3 billion, inclusive of a comprehensive Operations and Maintenance Contract.

Construction of the Inga–Shaba Project provided the Ministry of Energy and the Société nationale d&#x27;électricité (SNEL), with the means to promote further development activity throughout Zaire, by attracting potential investors and overseas firms; however, there have been suggestions that well-placed officials in the Mobutu government may have accepted gratuities at various critical junctures during the construction phase. As the Republic became more indebted to overseas financial entities, the Inga–Shaba Project ultimately accounted for approximately 20% of the former Zaire&#x27;s debt burden, which totaled $5 billion at the time, according to various credible sources.

==Route==
The ten-year project entailed design and construction of a electrical transmission line from Inga () at the mouth of the Congo River, specifically from the Inga Dam, one of Africa&#x27;s three largest hydroelectric complexes, to the distant copper mining region then known as Shaba, today Katanga. It featured switching stations at Selo (near Kinshasa) (), Kikwit (), Kananga () and Kamina (), prior to delivering power to the Kolwezi Inverter Station().

== Electrodes ==

The electrode for the Inga static inverter plant is situated 39 kilometres away from the station at and designed as linear ground electrode with a resistance of 0.24 ohm, while the electrode of Kolwezi static inverter plant, which is situated 11 kilometres away from the station at is designed as three-legged ground star electrode with a resistance of 0.14 ohm.

==Technology==
This scheme, equipped from the outset with thyristor valves provided by Swedish subcontractor ASEA, was designed to transmit 560 megawatts, in the first phase, at a symmetrical bipolar voltage of ±500 kilovolts. Although not the first 500 kV HVDC project in operation (the ±533 kV Cahora Bassa scheme having been completed in 1977) it was the first such scheme to use only a single twelve-pulse bridge per pole. Consequently, its thyristor valves were the highest-rated in the world (in terms of voltage) at the time and remained so until the completion, in 2007, of the ±450 kV, single-converter NorNed scheme. The thyristor valves for Inga Shaba had 258 thyristors in series in each valve and were air-insulated and air-cooled.

Inga Shaba was the longest HVDC transmission line in service until 2010, when it was overtaken by the 2071 km, ±800 kV, 6400 MW HVDC link from Xiangjiaba Dam to Shanghai in China. Because the line runs through relatively inaccessible terrain, an unusually broad right-of-way was cleared, at considerable expense, to ensure tower integrity.

The line operated initially at only 10% of capacity. In the 1990s, prior to major social unrest, the line increased its power transmission to 200 MW, still considerably below design capacity. As of 2000, reliability had been poor with many thyristor failures at the inverter station. As of 2010, the line was still functional as far as Bandundu, the capital of Bandundu province, approximately northeast of Kinshasa. In 2009 ABB was awarded a contract to refurbish and modernise the converter equipment. This upgrade is due to be completed in 2013.

<text>Moontan is the ninth album by Dutch rock band Golden Earring, released in 1973. It contains the radio hit &quot;Radar Love&quot;, and was voted ninth-best Dutch pop album ever by readers of music magazine &quot;Oor&quot; in 2008. In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album rated No. 32 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. &quot;Moontan&quot; is the band&#x27;s most successful album in the United States, being the only Golden Earring album to be certified Gold by the RIAA.

&quot;Vanilla Queen&quot; twice samples Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s character in &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;: &quot;Well, in simple English I&#x27;m...&quot; from the &quot;Lazy&quot; performance and &quot;What&#x27;s your name, Honey?&quot; from the &quot;Heat Wave&quot; performance.

==Track listing==


This is also the track listing on the original UK vinyl release (see above), as well as on early U.S. LP pressings (Track/MCA 396). The U.S. version of the album was originally issued with the UK &quot;exotic dancer&quot; cover with Jilly Johnson, but this was quickly withdrawn and replaced with the &quot;earring&quot; cover depicted at right.

In September 2021, &quot;Moontan Remastered &amp; Expanded&quot;, a new 2CD edition of the 1973 classic album, was released, featuring the original album newly remastered for the first time from the first-generation master tapes, and featuring six bonus tracks, nine previously unreleased mixes/different versions, a 32-page booklet with a new essay, memorabilia, and photos.

<text>John Mills (c. 1717 – c. 1794) was an English writer on agriculture, translator and editor. Mills and Gottfried Sellius are known for being the first to prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; for publication in 1745, which eventually resulted in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; published in France between 1751 and 1772.

As writer on agriculture, Mills is credited for publishing the earliest complete treatise on all branches of agriculture. His chief work, &quot;A New System of Practical Husbandry,&quot; in 5 volumes, appeared in 1767. It combines the results of the experience and observations of such writers as Evelyn, Duhamel, John Worlidge, and Jethro Tull, and was highly commended. Mills was a warm advocate of small farms.

== Biography ==
John Mills was a person of considerable eminence in the 18th century, though little definite is known because no record exists of his life. From his manner of expression, it is possible he may have lived his early life in foreign countries a long time, possibly in France, but he was not born there. In 1741 he was staying in London, where he had made preparations to go to Jamaica. He cancelled those plans because, as he wrote &quot;having met with something more advantageous which engages me to stay in England&quot; Mills married a French woman, and they had two children; one baptised in Paris on 27 April 1742 and another born in May 1743.

In 1743 Mills was in Paris for the purpose of bringing out, in concert with Gottfried Sellius, a German historian, a French edition of Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia;&quot; but André le Breton, the printer commissioned by him to manage the undertaking, cheated him out of the subscription money, assaulted him, and ultimately obtained a license in his own name. This was the origin of the famous &quot;Encyclopédie.&quot; Mills, unable to obtain redress, returned to England.

In 1755 Mills had started translation &quot;The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier from the French, and in 1763 Mills continued and completed the &quot;Memoirs of the Court of Augustus,&quot; by Thomas Blackwell the younger. In the 1760s he found his true vocation as a writer on agriculture, which started with his translation in 1762 of Duhamel du Monceau&#x27;s &quot;Practical Treatise of Husbandry.&quot; In 1766 he published an &quot;Essay on the Management of Bees.&quot; The &quot;A New System of Practical Husbandry,&quot; (1767) treated all branches of agriculture, and contains the first mention of the potato as grown in fields. In 1770 appeared a translation from the Latin of G.A. Gyllenberg&#x27;s &quot;Natural and Chemical Elements of Agriculture;&quot; in 1772 an &quot;Essay on the Weather&quot; (translated into Dutch in 1772), and &quot;Essays, Moral, Philosophical, and Political&quot; (anonymous, but advertised under his name); and in 1776 a &quot;Treatise on Cattle.&quot;

On 13 February 1766 Mills was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society with Benjamin Franklin as one of his sponsors. He was the first foreign associate of the French Agricultural Society, on whose list his name, with London as his residence, appears from 1767 to 1784. He was also member of the Royal Societies of Agriculture of Rouen, the Mannheim Academy of Sciences, and the Economical Society of Bern. 
== Work ==
John Mills was credited for his comprehensive knowledge of agriculture, and of the cultivation and use of the ground. He authored and translated several works in these fields. He became a well known author on the subject of husbandry in the 1760s, and was elected member of the Royal Society in 1766. He had come to prominence about twenty years earlier, while working on the translation of Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;.

=== &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; ===

Ephraim Chambers had first published his &quot;Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century. This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation of this work appeared from 1747 to 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert began translating Chambers into French, but in 1745 John Mills and Gottfried Sellius were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; for publication, which they entitled &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

Early in 1745 Mills and Sellius published a prospectus for the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; to attract subscribers to the project. This four-page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon, and accompanied by a plan (see image), stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748. The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been Denis Diderot.

The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals. The &quot;Mémoires pour l&#x27;histoire des sciences et des beaux arts&quot; journal praised the project as &quot;voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu&#x27;on ait faites depuis long-tems&quot; (here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a long time). The &quot;Mercure&quot; Journal in June 1745 wrote a 25-pages article specifically praising Mill&#x27;s role as translator; the Journal introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The Journal reports that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.

However, the co-operation fell apart later in 1745. André le Breton, the publisher commissioned to manage the undertaking, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming, for example, that Mills&#x27; knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation, le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took le Breton to court, but the court decided in le Breton&#x27;s favour. Le Breton replaced Mills with Jean Paul de Gua de Malves, who in turn was later replaced by Denis Diderot. Soon after the court ruling, Mills left for England.

=== &quot;The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine&quot;, 1755 ===

Mills re-emerged from the shadow in 1755 as the translator of &quot;The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine&quot;. This work was originally written in 10 volumes by Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier, who was Professor of Rhetoric in the Collège de Beauvais in Paris. Mills had translated from the French the first two volumes, when in 1755 a review of this work was published in &quot;The monthly review of literary journal&quot;. The review introduced Mills as the translator, with the following phrase:

:Mr. Mills, and his other works, we are alike strangers to; but have been informed he has published some tracts, with reputation, abroad; and that he was the first undertaker and promoter of the translation of Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopædia&quot; into French...

In Robert Watt&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca Britannica&quot; (1824, p. 670) this translation was credited to another John Mills Esq., but this description clearly indicates we are dealing with one and the same person. The 1755 review was critical about Mill&#x27;s translation skills, and stated:

:...If he is an Englishman, which, but for his name, we should doubt, from his manner of expression, it is possible he may have lived so long in foreign countries, as to have somewhat lessened his acquaintance with his vernacular language: for we have met with few writers that have shewn themselves less masters of its purity, Mr. Johnson has judiciously observed, that &quot;the great pest of speech is frequency of translation. No book was ever turned from one language to another, without imparting something of its native idiom; this is the most mischievous and comprehensive innovation; single words may enter by thousands, and &#x27;the fabric of the tongue continue the fame; but new phraseology changes much at once, it alters not the single stones of the building, but the order of the columns.&quot;

The review specifically expressed, that Mills &quot;left his diction in a Gallic form, that renders it uncouth to an English ear&quot;. They hoped, that the remaining volumes would be more agreeable to the reader. It is unknown if Mills fulfilled this expectation, but he did translate another eight volumes, which were published in the next years.

=== &quot;A practical Treatise of Husbandry,&quot; 1759 ===
Mills first serious work in the field of agriculture, was the translation of Duhamel du Monceau&#x27;s &quot;Practical Treatise of Husbandry,&quot; from the French. The full title of this translation is: 

:&quot;A practical Treatise of Husbandry: Wherein are contained many useful and valuable Experiments and Observations in the New Husbandry, collected during a Series of Years, by the celebrated,&quot; M. Duhamel Du Monceau, &quot;Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences dt Paris, Fellow of the Royal Society, London, &amp;c. Also the most approved Practice of the best English Farmers, in the old Method of Husbandry. With Copper-Plates of several new and useful Instruments.&quot;, 4tO. 16s. Whiston, &amp;c.

Duhamel&#x27;s work originally consisted of five volumes, which were published at different times. Mills didn&#x27;t translation this work as a whole. He translated only such experiments as seemed to him most instructive in the then modern practice of farming, either according to the old or new method. Mills explained in the preface, that &quot;Duhamel and his correspondents have set the world an example which has long been wanted, and greatly desired by all who have the good of their country at heart, and are in the least sensible of the importance of Agriculture. They have given us a series of experiments in this most useful art, continued for several years together, with accuracy and judgment, and related in a clear, distinct, manner.&quot;

According to Mills the work of Duhamel is noted for it empirical origin. Theory alone can avail but little in agriculture, Mills declared, referring to the following observation by Francis Home: 
:Agriculture does not take its rise originally from reason, but from fact and experience. It is a branch of natural philosophy, and can only be improved from a knowledge of facts, as they happen in nature. It is by attending to these facts that the other branches of natural philosophy have been so much advanced during these two last ages. Medicine has attained its present per section, only from the history of diseases and cafes delivered down. Chemistry is now reduced to a regular system, by the means of experiments made either by chance or design. But where are the experiments in Agriculture to answer this purpose ? When I look round for such, I can find few or none. There then lies the impediment in the way of Agriculture. Books in that art, we are not deficient in: but the book which we want, is a book of experiments.

Only after reading the three first volumes of Experiments published by M. Duhamel, Francis Home declared: &quot;They are distinct, exact, conclusive so far as they have gone, and stand a model for experiments in Agriculture. What a shame for Great Britain, where Agriculture is so much cultivated, to leave its exact value to be determined by foreigners!&quot;

=== &quot;Memoirs of the court of Augustus,&quot; 1763 ===

Another of Mills&#x27; projects was the continuation and completion of the third volume of &quot;Memoirs of the court of Augustus&quot; in 1763
from the original papers of Thomas Blackwell. Blackwell&#x27;s works, including &quot;An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer&quot; (1735), &quot;Letters Concerning Mythology&quot; (1748) and &quot;Memoirs of the Court of Augustus&quot; (3 vols., 1753–63), established him as one of the premier figures in the Scottish Enlightenment. Blackwell had published the first two volumes between 1753 and 1757, and the third volume was printed off to p. 144, when Blackwell died. An advertisement prefixed to this volume explained the continuation:

:&quot;The proprietor, unwilling to let the sets of those gentlemen who had purchased the former volumes remain incomplete, put all the papers left by the author, relative to this work, into the hands of the present editor, who begs leave to observe, that those papers being, in general, Little more than loose leaves, detached notes, memorandums, and, very often, only bare hints of things intended to be said, without any connection, reference to each other, or even paging, he hopes he may justly claim some indulgence from the public, wherever he has erred in his endeavours to give them the order and method which he imagines might have been Dr. Blackwell&#x27;s, if that gentleman had lived to finish his work.&quot;

Mills further stated Blackwell&#x27;s loose papers were deficient, and he had to recourse to the Ancients. A review of this work by Tobias Smollett in &quot;The Critical Review: Or, Annals of Literature&quot; stated, that &quot;it is impossible for us to ascertain the particular passages of this publication that belong to Mr. Mills; but we will venture to say, upon the whole, that this volume, both in point of composition and language, is not inferior to its two elder brothers.&quot;

=== &quot;A new and complete system of practical husbandry,&quot; 1762–1765 ===
John Mills wrote &quot;A new and complete system of practical husbandry,&quot; in five volumes, which were published between 1762 and 1765. The full titles of this work was: 

: &quot;A new and complete system of practical husbandry, containing all that experience has proved to be most useful in farming, either in the old or new method, with a comparative view of both, and whatever is beneficial to the husbandman, or conducive &#x27;to the ornament and improvement of the country gentleman&#x27;s estate;&quot;

The five volumes of a new and complete system of husbandry, by Mills, is the first publication on agriculture that presents all the branches of the art within the compass of one work. John Worlidge began the attempt, but failed in the comprehension that is required.
* The first volume of Mills treats &quot;soils&quot; in the different kinds, clays, sands, and loams; manures, animal and vegetable, and composts; of the improvement of moorlands, and boggy lands and all uncultivated lands; the culture of grain and pulse; the sowing and change of crops; the culture of wheat, and rye, oats, barley, maize, or Indian corn, millet, panic, rice, buckwheat; culture of pulse, viz., beans, peas, vetches, lentils, and lupines.
* Volume II. contains the horse-hoeing husbandry of grain and pulse; the distempers of corn.
* Volume III. treats the enemies of corn; preservation of grain, turnips, potatoes, cabbages, clover, sainfoin, lucerne, cytisus, burnet, natural grasses; enclosing, and the situation of farms and farm houses.
* Volume IV. contains &quot;Gardening, and the culture of hops and olive&quot;.&quot;
* Volume V. treats &quot; The making and managing o fermented liquors,&quot; and concludes with hemp, flax, madder, woad, weld, or dyer&#x27;s weed, and a long appendix to each volume.

Mills leads all the previous authors in the arrangement of his work, which undoubtedly carried away the palm of agricultural writing at the time of its appearance. He joins extensively with John Evelyn and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, and does ample justice to the system of cultivation proposed by Jethro Tull. Turnips and potatoes were in general use, and the Rotherham plough is figured in the work, as are also thirteen of the natural grasses.

Potatoes are entered in this work for the first time as a vegetable in the field cultivation, being about 150 years after the use of the plant was known as an esculent root. Mills quotes the authority of Miller in proof of its value and extensive utility. This author conveys his meaning and intelligence in the true style of writing—cool and plausible, and with becoming diffidence on all scientific disquisitions. No dogmatism mars the placid tenor of his story.

Mills was a great stickler for small farms, almost cottier allotments; he did not see that any single bodily labour can effect but very little unless in combination, and that extensive projects employ most labour, and produce the largest results. A thick mist long clouded the human vision on that and similar points, and is not yet dispelled.

=== Other works ===
The full titles of his other works Mills authored were:
* &quot;A treatise on cattle, showing the most approved methods of breeding, rearing, and fitting for use horses, asses, mules, horned cattle, sheep, goats, and swine, with directions for the proper treatment of them in their several diseases. To which is added a dissertation on their contagious diseases, carefully collected from the best authorities, and interspersed with remarks.&quot;
* &quot;An essay on the management of bees; wherein is shown the method of rearing these useful insects, and that the practice of saving their lives when their honey and wax are taken from them was known to the ancients, and is in itself simple and easily executed;&quot;
* &quot;An essay on the weather, with remarks on the shepherd of Banbury&#x27;s rules forjudging of its changes, and directions for preserving lives and buildings from the fatal effects of lightning;&quot;
The treatise on cattle is an octavo volume of 491 pages, and treats horses, asses, mules, horned cattle, sheep, goats, and swine, with the cures of their disorders, which have a dissertation on their nature. The matter is more descriptive than that of Bradley, but not so practical in the application, though much merit is attached to the knowledge it shows of the origin and progress of the different animals.

Mills also translated &quot;Duhamel&#x27;s husbandry;&quot; in 1759, &quot;Natural and chemical elements of agriculture, from the Latin of Gustavus Adolphus Gyllenborg;&quot; in 1770, and he was the reputed author of some essays, moral, philosophical, and political.

== Legacy ==
In the field of agricultural science John Mills was a proponent of a new movement named &quot;horse-hoeing husbandry&quot; or &quot;new husbandry&quot;. This was based on the work of Jethro Tull, and supported by Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau in France, Michel Lullin de Chateauvieux in Switzerland, Mills in England. Mills translated their work, and introduced it in England, wherein for example Arthur Young learned about the work of Louis François Henri de Menon. In return Mills&#x27;s main work &quot;A New and Complete System of Practical Husbandry&quot; was translated into German, and had its influence in the main land.

The British &quot;The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry&quot; 3rd ed. (1777). &quot;The Complete Farmer,&quot; listed John Mills in the subtitle of this work among the foremost authorities in the field of Husbandry of his time. Other people mentioned in this context were Carl Linnaeus, Louis François Henri de Menon, Hugh Plat, John Evelyn, John Worlidge, John Mortimer, Jethro Tull, William Ellis, Philip Miller, Thomas Hale, Edward Lisle, Roque, and Arthur Young.

In the 19th century Donaldson (1854) in his &quot;Agricultural Biography,&quot; credited Mills&#x27; &quot;Practical Husbandry&quot; for being the &quot;first publication on agriculture that presents all the branches of the art within the compass of one work. &#x27;Worlidge began the attempt, but failed in the comprehension required.&quot; However, by then most of the work of the proponents of &quot;horse-hoeing husbandry&quot; had become obsolete, due to the rapid progress of agriculture in those days. Specifically Mills&#x27; &quot;Practical Husbandry&quot; was used as reference until the 1820s. Other of his works have also been credited until in our days. For example &quot;The Management of Bees,&quot; was called &quot;one of the bee books which are worth reading over and over again.&quot; And the &quot;An Essay in the Weather Mills&quot; is considered unmatched for a long time &quot;despite two centuries of philosophical work.&quot;

<text>Win, Lose or Die, first published in 1989, was the eighth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder and Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

Beginning with this novel, and continuing for the remainder of the John Gardner series, Bond is promoted to the Royal Navy rank of captain.

==Plot summary==
M receives word that a terrorist organisation known as BAST (Brotherhood of Anarchy and Secret Terrorism) is planning to infiltrate and destroy a top-secret Royal Navy aircraft carrier-based summit, the &quot;Stewards&#x27; Meeting&quot;, scheduled a year hence, comprising American President George H. W. Bush, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. James Bond is returned to active duty in the Royal Navy and promoted from Commander to Captain, in order to infiltrate the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and identify potential sleeper agents.

In the months leading to the top-secret summit, Bond spends his time training at Yeovilton learning to fly a Navy Sea Harrier jet. Learning of Bond&#x27;s mission, BAST decides that he is a hindrance to their plans and attempts to kill him by attempting to shoot him down during a Sea Harrier training exercise. Later, when Bond goes on holiday in Italy, another attempt is made on his life. Bond escapes, but is apparently unable to save his then-current girlfriend, Beatrice Maria da Ricci.

Returning from holiday Bond boards HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and is tasked with security for the &quot;Stewards&#x27; Meeting&quot;, all while a massive war game is being carried out among the American, British, and Soviet Navies, known as &quot;Landsea &#x27;89&quot;. Before long Bond is at the centre of a murder investigation of an American Naval Intelligence officer, and he leaves to report the incident, BAST executes its plans to capture the ship and hold the world&#x27;s three most powerful leaders for a $600 billion ransom.

==Characters==
* James Bond
* M
* Bill Tanner
* Bassam Baradj: Born Robert Besavitsky in New York, Baradj is the main leader of BAST, codenamed &quot;Viper.&quot; BAST&#x27;s plot to take over and hold the world&#x27;s three most powerful leaders was his idea. He is later shot by Beatrice Maria da Ricci in Gibraltar.
* Abou Hamarik: Hamarik, codenamed &quot;Snake,&quot; is the second of three leaders of BAST. He is able to infiltrate HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; by killing an American Naval Intelligence officer who has been called into replace another that was murdered on board the carrier. Hamarik is found out and is wounded by Nikki Ratnikov after he had taken Bond and a number of secret service agents from the three nations hostage. After the incident, Hamarik is arrested by Bond.
* Clover Pennington: First Officer Clover Pennington is a Wren with the Royal Navy. She is secretly the third head of BAST, codenamed &quot;Cat.&quot; Under Pennington&#x27;s leadership while Bond is away BAST is able to take over the aircraft carrier with a number of supporters (all Wrens), who were aboard the ship for the Landsea &#x27;89 war game. Pennington is accidentally killed by one of her supporters after being used as cover and pushed into a room by Bond.
* Beatrice Maria da Ricci: Ricci is an operative working for the British secret service who has been tasked with protecting Bond, specifically while on holiday. She is supposedly killed while on holiday in Italy with Bond, however, she makes a return later on, informing Bond that her death was appropriately faked in order to save Bond from another attempt on his life by BAST. She and Bond later team up to arrest Bassam Baradj, although ultimately she kills Baradj while saving Bond&#x27;s life.
* Nikki Ratnikov: Nikki Ratnikov is a secret service agent from Russia who was sent to protect Mikhail Gorbachev during the Steward&#x27;s Meeting. She is killed by Abou Hamarik during an exchange of gunfire while on board HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;. During the exchange she successfully wounds Hamarik, which later leads to his arrest.

==Reviews==
&quot;Private Eye&quot;″s anonymous critic complained that each Gardner book takes &quot;Bond a further step or two away from the tall, resourceful ladykiller who first appeared in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;&quot;, and that &quot;the real Bond atmosphere has been dead for upwards of 30 years.&quot; The critic also believed that Bond was a product of his times. &quot;Gardner manages to remove most of the characteristics that made [Bond] interesting&quot; and that the book&#x27;s explosions, throat-cuttings and neck-breakings, &quot;[have] an odd, perfunctory quality.&quot; The novel, &quot;has none of Fleming&#x27;s ability to build up tension or introduce detail casually. When Gardner talks knowledgeably about aircraft specifications the effect is only to reassure us that he has read the appropriate flight manual.&quot; The critic also notes that Gardner &quot;can&#x27;t quite bring himself to take it seriously.&quot;

Charles Champlin in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted how different Fleming and Gardner are. &quot;Ian Fleming wrote as a hedonist who prospered by dramatizing a life&#x27;s worth of fantasies - acquisitions, indulgences, guilt-free sex and violence. John Gardner writes in &quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot; as a military affairs reporter who describes the operations of a Harrier VTOL aircraft as lovingly as Fleming described Pussy Galore. Gardner is long on facts, short on feelings. This is the eighth of the counterfeit James Bonds by Gardner.&quot; Commenting on the villain, Champlin writes, &quot;Its leader, who intends to dispose of practically everyone, is as colorless a supervillain as ever Bond has faced. Call him Drabfinger.&quot; The book &quot;is all so unamusing and juicelessly programmatic. The persistence of the series, despite these pallid copyings, is the ultimate tribute to the richness of Fleming&#x27;s original invention.&quot;

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; critic Margaret Cannon said, &quot;this isn&#x27;t Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond, but the eighth book written by John Gardner, the recreator of Bond, and it&#x27;s a far cry from the original. Bond, with his libido and gadgetry, is a creation of the fifties, when sex was furtive and gadgets were fun. Today, such authors as Tom Clancy serve up real technological frights that make all of Bond&#x27;s plots seem like the innocent revels they are. Furthermore, Gardner&#x27;s Bond is too American – too breezy and beefy - to be the real 007. This one needs to RIP.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said that, &quot;Despite too many acronyms, too much artillery, and too many layers of deceptive identity, this is still one of Gardner&#x27;s better Bonds, guaranteed to make you feel excited as well as a little foolish.&quot;

<text>Sankaty Head Golf Club is one of the easternmost golf courses in Massachusetts, perched on the edge of Nantucket Island in Siasconset, Massachusetts. The course was designed by Emerson Armstrong and opened in 1923. It is an 18-hole course. It is one of the few examples of world-class links-style golf outside of the UK (see Shinnecock Hills). The Atlantic wraps around 270 degrees of the layout and the Sankaty Head Lighthouse looms over the front nine.

Sankaty members are a driving force behind the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund. They also have successfully sustained one of the few remaining caddy camps in the world, Camp Sankaty Head, which has existed since the late 1930s. Membership is private. Famous members include Jack Welch (whose island residence is just off the 4th tee-box), Lawrence Bossidy, Robert Charles Wright, Harry Fraker, Amos Hostetter Jr., Henry C. Pfaff, and Bill Belichick.

On June 4, 2019, the Sankaty Head Golf Club was chosen to be the host site of the USGA&#x27;s 41st U.S. Mid-Amateur. This was their first hosted USGA championship and was played September 25–30, 2021.

== The Caddy Camp ==
The Sankaty Head Caddy Camp, directed by Dave Hinman, is the last remaining caddy camp in the United States and one of the last in the world. Here, 60 caddies, 6 junior staff members, a program director, caddymaster, camp director, assistant camp director, and cook are located between the 11th and 13th fairways on the course. After being picked through an application process, caddies come to this camp from Iowa, Florida, New York, South Carolina, Maine, New Jersey and other states.

There are three &quot;huts&quot; in the camp, with 20 boys in each. Other buildings in camp include a mess hall, recreational hall, library, laundry shack, staff hut, and the director&#x27;s hut. While the boys are not caddying, they can enjoy organized team sports of softball, volleyball, football, basketball, and of course, golf. Also in their free time, the boys can enjoy recreational golf, a workout in the weight &quot;pit&quot;, or a game of ping pong in the rec hall.

On August 2, 2011, a fire at the caddy camp erupted during a propane delivery. The fire consumed three buildings and injured the driver of the propane tanker truck.

<text>The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) was established in 1998 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) &quot;to develop the field of astrobiology and provide a scientific framework for flight missions.&quot; In December 2019 the institute&#x27;s activities were suspended.

The NAI is a virtual, distributed organization that integrates astrobiology research and training programs in concert with the national and international science communities.

== History ==
Although NASA had explored the idea of forming an astrobiology institute in the past, when the Viking biological experiments returned negative results for life on Mars, the public lost interest and federal funds for exobiology dried up. In 1996, the announcement of possible traces of ancient life in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite from Mars led to new interest in the subject. At the same time, NASA developed the Origins Program, broadening its reach from exobiology to &quot;astrobiology&quot;, the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.

In 1998, $9 million was set aside to fund the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), an interdisciplinary research effort using the expertise of different scientific research institutions and universities from across the country, centrally linked to Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. Gerald Soffen former Project Scientist with the Viking program, helped coordinate the new institute. In May, NASA selected eleven science teams, each with a Principal Investigator (PI). NAI was established in July with Scott Hubbard as interim Director. Nobel laureate Baruch S. Blumberg was appointed the first Director of the institute, and served from May 15, 1999 – October 14, 2002.

==Program==
The NASA Astrobiology Program includes the NAI as one of four components, including the Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology Program; the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development (ASTID) Program; and the Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) Program. Program budgets for fiscal year 2008 were as follows: NAI, $16 million; Grants for the Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology Program, $11 million; ASTID, $9 million; ASTEP, $5 million.

==Teams==
As of 2018, the NAI has 10 teams including about 600 researchers distributed across ~100 institutions. It also has 13 international partner organizations. Some past and present teams are: 
===International partners===

<text>Simo Johannes Valakari (born 28 April 1973) is a Finnish football manager and a former international football player. He is currently the manager of Scottish Premiership side St Johnstone.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Valakari played in the youth sector of Käpylän Pallo (KäPa) in Käpylä, Helsinki, and began his senior career with KäPa first team in 1990 in the fourth-tier Kolmonen. He played also for Kontula-based club KontU in the Finnish second-tier Ykkönen and third-tier Kakkonen, before first moving to Veikkausliiga club FinnPa in 1995 and then to Scottish Premier League club Motherwell in 1996. After four seasons in Scotland, he was off to Derby County in the Premier League.

Valakari failed to become a first team regular at Pride Park Stadium and decided to join Dallas Burn for the 2004 MLS season and finished the year with a goal and four assists. Following the 2006 season, his contract was not renewed with the team, known by that time as FC Dallas.

Valakari decided to return to Finland for the 2007 Veikkausliiga season, where he signed for TPS, managed by Mixu Paatelainen. He retired from playing in 2009 after several injuries.

===International===
Valakari was a regular with the Finnish national team during his stay in Europe. He made a total of 32 caps for his country.

==Managerial career==
Valakari was named manager of Åbo IFK (ÅIFK) in January 2010 and subsequently ended his playing career. He, however returned &quot;home&quot; as he announced his return to Käpylän Pallo as a youth coach after the 2010 season.

===SJK===
In 2012, Valakari joined Seinäjoen Jalkapallokerho (SJK) as the head coach. In 2013, he managed the team to gain promotion to the Veikkausliiga and they went on to win the Finnish championship in 2015. The team also won the Finnish League Cup in 2014 and the Finnish Cup in 2016. In the early 2016, he had been linked with Motherwell, but eventually signed an upgraded contract extension with SJK on 10 February 2016. Valakari was dismissed on 17 February 2017, due to disagreement with the club&#x27;s chairman Raimo Sarajärvi.

===Tromsø IL===
After working as assistant manager for the Finnish national team after being fired from the SJK job, he was appointed head coach of Norwegian Eliteserien side Tromsø IL in June 2017. In 2018, his contract was extended until 2022, but he was fired due to disagreements in April 2020, after the club had suffered a relegation at the end of the 2019 season.

===KuPS===
In November 2020, Valakari was appointed as the head coach of Kuopion Palloseura (KuPS). Under Valakari, KuPS won two consecutive Finnish Cup titles in 2021 and 2022, and finished as the Veikkausliiga runner-up twice, falling just a one point short to HJK on both occasions. Valakari also led KuPS to the UEFA Europa Conference League qualifiers on two occasions. In 2021–22, the club reached to the (fourth) play-off round, but was knocked out by Union Berlin. Next year they reached to the 3rd round, where they eventually fell short to Young Boys. In the summer 2022, Valakari was rumoured for a head coach position of Motherwell, but eventually was not chosen.

His contract with KuPS was terminated by mutual consent on 13 January 2023, after Valakari had announced his lack of &quot;passion and ability&quot; to continue to coach KuPS.

===FK Auda===
Shortly after his contract termination with KuPS, it was announced that Valakari was named the head coach of FK Auda in Latvia for the 2023 season. Valakari was named The Virslīga Coach of the Month in September 2023. At the end of the season, Auda finished 3rd in the league and won their first medal in the premier division, and also qualified for the UEFA Conference League qualifiers again.

===Riga FC===
On 13 December 2023, it was reported in Finnish media that Valakari is about to be named the new head coach of a fellow Latvian side Riga FC. On the next day, the club confirmed that they had appointed Valakari as the new head coach. On 2 March 2024, Valakari and Riga FC won the 2024 Latvian Supercup, beating RFS in the final on penalties. On 14 September, in a press conference after the match against Auda, Valakari hinted that he was not the one who had selected the starting line-up for the match. He left the club on 30 September, after Riga and St. Johnstone had agreed on a fee for his contract. Prior to his departure, Riga FC was comfortably sitting in the 2nd place of the league table.

===St. Johnstone===
On 1 October 2024, Valakari returned to Scotland when he was named the new manager of the Scottish Premiership club St. Johnstone on a three-year deal, becoming the first foreign manager in the club&#x27;s 140-year-history. Due to work visa issues, the first two matches he couldn&#x27;t officially access the bench, but on 26 October, he managed St. Johnstone as they beat Dundee 2–1 away at Dens Park.

==Personal life==
Valakari&#x27;s three sons are also footballers. His oldest son Paavo is a former player and current coach, Onni is playing professionally for San Diego FC, and the youngest one Toivo plays for Käpylän Pallo in Helsinki, Finland.

Valakari meditates in his everyday life.

<doc id="1277241" wikidata="Q1530907" url="?curid=1277241" title="Brokenclaw">
<text>Brokenclaw, first published in 1990, was the tenth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The book title is sometimes presented as two words, but is correctly one word since it is a character name.

Instead of picking up where the novelisation &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; left off, &quot;Brokenclaw&quot; completely ignores the story&#x27;s events and continues from &quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot;.

==Plot summary==
After expressing frustration over a lack of action after his year-long mission with the Royal Navy (as detailed in &quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot;), Bond threatens to resign. Instead, M orders Bond to take a vacation. Bond travels to Victoria, British Columbia where he is intrigued by Lee Fu-Chu, a half-Blackfoot, half-Chinese philanthropist who is known as &quot;Brokenclaw&quot; because of a deformed hand.

Later, Bond is ordered to San Francisco where he is tasked to investigate the kidnapping of several scientists who have been working on a new submarine detection system and an &quot;antidote&quot; known as LORDS and LORDS DAY. Bond and CIA agent Chi-Chi Sue go undercover using the codenames Peter Abelard and Héloïse that were assigned to two agents from the People&#x27;s Republic of China that are sent to evaluate the submarine technology before purchasing it.

Ultimately, Bond discovers that Brokenclaw is involved in this scheme on behalf of China, and also has plans of his own which involve sparking a worldwide economic disaster by bringing about the collapse of the dollar by tapping into the New York Stock Exchange, which would in turn bring down other major currencies worldwide. The plan, dubbed &quot;Operation Jericho&quot; was a long-term plan initially started by the Japanese, but now believed to have been worked on simultaneously by the Chinese before being acquired by Brokenclaw.

Brokenclaw&#x27;s hideout in California is raided by Special Forces after he is located by Naval Intelligence officer Ed Rushia who was searching and attempting to help Bond and Chi-Chi while on their mission. Brokenclaw escapes the raid only to be tracked down by Bond and Rushia, off the books, to the Chelan Mountains of Washington where Bond is challenged to a torture ritual known as o-kee-pa. In the end, the competition comes down to a fight between the two using bow and arrows; Brokenclaw barely misses Bond and in turn is shot through the neck by Bond&#x27;s arrow.

==Characters==
* James Bond
* M
* Bill Tanner
* Ann Reilly
* Brokenclaw: Half Chinese, half Blackfoot, he was born Lee Fu-Chu. He received the name &quot;Brokenclaw&quot; because of a deformity in his left hand where his thumb is on the right (viewing the palm up) rather than the left. Brokenclaw is a crime lord in San Francisco who has a large hold on the city&#x27;s prostitution, gambling, and drug rackets. He also works for CELD (Central External Liaison Department), the intelligence service of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and possibly CCI (Central Control of Intelligence). Brokenclaw has managed to get his hands on a new technology that can detect submarine signatures which he plans to give to CELD. Additionally, Brokenclaw also plans to cause economic disaster by bringing about the collapse of the dollar. Ultimately Brokenclaw&#x27;s plans are prevented by Bond. He later retreats to a getaway location in the Chelan Mountains of Washington. There he challenges Bond to a ritual known as o-kee-pa. During this competition he is shot by Bond in the neck with an arrow.
* Miss Sue Chi-Ho: Known to her friends as Chi-Chi Sue or simply Chi-Chi, she is on loan from the CIA. She can speak fluent Cantonese and was previously a U.S. Naval Intelligence officer. She accompanies Bond on &quot;Operation Curve&quot; posing as Jenny Mo, an operative codenamed Héloïse from the People&#x27;s Republic of China who was sent to evaluate Brokenclaw&#x27;s submarine detection technology.
* Ed Rushia: A Commander with U.S. Naval Intelligence. He is tasked with following Bond and Chi-Chi to ensure their safety throughout their mission. After Bond and Chi-Chi disappear, Rushia searches California for them. After eventually picking up their signal he helps Bond escape a deathtrap in which Bond is thrown to Brokenclaw&#x27;s wolves. He later teams up with Bond, off the record, to find Brokenclaw in Washington after Brokenclaw&#x27;s hideout is raided.

<doc id="1277246" wikidata="Q5185528" url="?curid=1277246" title="Criminal Assets Bureau">
<text>The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) () is a law enforcement agency in Ireland. The CAB was established with powers to focus on the illegally acquired assets of criminals involved in serious crime. The aims of the CAB are to identify the criminally acquired assets of persons and to take the appropriate action to deny such people these assets. This action is taken particularly through the application of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. The CAB was established as a body corporate with perpetual succession in 1996 and is founded on the multi-agency concept, drawing together law enforcement officers, tax officials, social welfare officials as well as other specialist officers including legal officers, forensic analysts and financial analysts. This multi-agency concept is regarded by some as the model for other European jurisdictions.

The CAB is not a division of the (police) but rather an independent body corporate although it has many of the powers normally given to the . The Chief Bureau Officer is drawn from a member of the holding the rank of Chief Superintendent and is appointed by the Garda Commissioner. The remaining staff of the CAB are appointed by the Minister for Justice. CAB members retain their original powers as if they were working within their separate entities and have direct access to information and databases that their original organisations are allowed by law.
 This ability to share information was described by the Garda Síochána Inspectorate in its Crime Investigation Report of October 2014 as &quot;a good model that could be replicated outside of CAB&quot;.

The CAB reports annually to the Minister through the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and this report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Justice, in publishing the 2011 CAB Annual Report, stated: &quot;The work of the bureau is one of the key law enforcement responses to tackling crime and the Government is very much committed to further strengthening the powers of the bureau through forthcoming legislative proposals.&quot; In publishing the Bureau&#x27;s 2012 report the Minister for Justice set out: &quot;The Annual Report provides an insight into the workings of the Bureau and highlights the advantage of adopting a multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approach to the targeting of illicit assets. The Bureau is an essential component in the State’s law enforcement response to serious and organised crime and the Government is fully committed to further strengthening its powers through future legislative reform.&quot;

The Minister for Justice set out that Ireland, through the work of the Bureau, has established itself as a jurisdiction that is responding to that challenge and the work of the Bureau is internationally recognised as a best practice approach to tackling criminality and the illicit monies it generates.

The CAB has been effective against organised criminals, especially those involved in the importation and distribution of drugs. It has also been used against corrupt public officials and terrorists.

==Legislative framework==
The Law Reform Commission provides consolidated legislation relating to the Bureau, namely:
* Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 (updated to 28 May 2019)
* Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 (updated to 30 July 2018)

The Proceeds of Crime Acts were amended further by the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 is designed to facilitate the seizure of property which is suspected to be the proceeds of crime by expanding the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize those proceeds. This act amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 in two key respects. First, it allows the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize property which it suspects to be the proceeds of crime for up to 21 days. Second, it reduces the threshold value of property which can be pursued by the Criminal Assets Bureau from €13,000 to €5,000.

==Objectives==
The statutory objectives of the CAB are –
#the identification of the assets of persons which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly from criminal conduct; 
#the taking of appropriate action under the law to deprive or to deny those persons of such assets or the benefit of such assets, and 
#the pursuit of any necessary investigation or other preparatory work in relation to relevant proceedings.

The emergence of CAB signalled a more focused approach on targeting the financial proceeds of crime than previously existed.

==Overview==
The CAB collected €89 million in taxes in its first ten years of existence and it also engaged in initiatives to curtail international criminality. The CAB has a staff of 91, including members of , Revenue Commissioners, (both customs and taxes officers), and civil servants from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice. Its annual budget for 2011 was €6.673 million, of which 86% is salary cost. This was reduced to €6.410 million in 2012, but has increased to 8.832m Euro in 2018.

===Budget===
The budget of the Bureau over the period 2008 to 2021 was as follows:


===Officers and staff===
Officers and staff of the CAB (with the exception of members of the and the Bureau Legal Officer) are protected with statutory anonymity. This anonymity, whilst causing some concerns, has been recognised an important practical issue for all countries when faced with action against people who may be involved in violent crime and extortion and recognises that although police and customs officers are usually trained to deal with such threats and to expect them, revenue and social security officials do not reasonably expect to have to deal with such risks when they take a job.

A number of people have been convicted for threatening CAB officers:

* Christopher Pratt was sentenced in 2013 to three years in prison for threatening to &quot;take the head off&quot; a CAB officer.
* Paschal Kelly was sentenced in 2015 to four-and-a-half years in prison for threatening a CAB officer, tax evasion and serious driving offences, and more recently in February 2019 was sentenced to 18 years in prison following a conviction for a &quot;tiger kidnapping&quot;.

Fachtna Murphy was the first Chief Bureau Officer and Barry Galvin was the first Bureau Legal Officer. The current Chief Bureau Officer is Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gubbins (who succeeded Pat Clavin) and the current Bureau Legal Officer is Kevin McMeel. The former Bureau Legal Officer was Declan O&#x27;Reilly. The Bureau Legal Officer is appointed following a recruitment campaign run by the Public Appointments Service.

==Background==
The Criminal Assets Bureau was established on 15 October 1996 by the then Minister for Justice, Nora Owen TD. The CAB was established to deal with increasing levels of serious organised crime in Ireland, most notable being the murders of crime reporter Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.

The CAB was set up by the Oireachtas as a body corporate primarily for the purpose of ensuring that persons should not benefit from any assets acquired by them from any criminal activity. It was given power to take all necessary actions in relation to seizing and securing assets derived from criminal activity, certain powers to ensure that the proceeds of such activity are subject to tax, and also in relation to the Social Welfare Acts. However, as the High Court has noted, it is not a prosecuting body nor a police authority but rather it is an investigating authority which, having investigated and used its powers of investigation, then applies to the High Court for assistance in enforcing its functions.

==Proceeds of crime==
A novel or radical aspect of the CAB was the use of civil forfeiture to freeze and seize the proceeds of criminal conduct under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce civil forfeiture. Civil forfeiture involved a recognition on the part of the State that conventional methods of tackling organised crime were ineffective. Whilst the CAB was perhaps intended to confiscate the assets of drug dealers and those involved in organised crime its powers can extend to all assets that are the result of criminal activity. Even though the CAB focuses on serious and organised crime, it has increasingly moved against low- and medium-level offenders who may present as poor role models within their communities, albeit that these cases often cost more to bring than they return financially. The CAB has been distinguished from other agencies who tackle serious organised crime in Ireland in that those agencies may be typified as being reactive whereas the CAB is proactive; a fact which may be considered as representing a significant development in crime control. Whilst novel to Ireland, the concept of forfeiture in the absence of a criminal conviction has a long ancestry, with roots in ancient Rome and evidence of its lineage in the Old Testament. It has long been an important feature of the jurisprudence of the US and has recently been adopted in other common law jurisdictions, including the UK and the Cayman Islands, in their proceeds of crime legislation.

In 2005, the CAB&#x27;s powers were amended by Part 3 of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005. The purpose of this Act was to make further provision in relation to the recovery and disposal of proceeds of crime. This involved amending four different acts as follows: 
#the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, 
#the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, 
#the Criminal Justice Act 1994, and 
#the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001.

The Act was intended to substantially bolster the powers of the CAB in the continuing battle to target the proceeds of all types of crime and will extend those powers to the proceeds of white-collar crime and corruption. The substantial provisions of the Act extended the proceeds of crime legislation to cover foreign criminality and corrupt enrichment. In addition, there were a number of technical provisions relating to court procedures, search powers and evidence.

Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and 2005, if the CAB can satisfy the High Court on the balance of probabilities that specified property is the proceeds of crime, the court will make an interim order over the property preventing anybody from dealing with it. This order stays in place for 21 days, following which an application is made for an interlocutory hearing, on notice to any person who has an interest in that property. If it appears to the court that such property is the proceeds of crime, despite anything said by any respondent, an interlocutory order is put in place for a period of seven years. In the course of that time any person who can satisfy the court that the property is not the proceeds of crime can move to have the order lifted. If no such order has been granted during those seven years, the CAB can seek a disposal order effectively extinguishing anybody&#x27;s rights to the properties and transferring it to the central exchequer. In April 2014, Deputy Eamonn Maloney sponsored a private members Bill to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts. Section 1 of the Bill seeks to reduce the seven-year period to two years. This Bill was listed before the Dáil on Friday 8 May 2015 and is viewed as a move by the Government to toughen the laws on confiscating criminals&#x27; assets and similarly is expected to yield a multimillion-euro windfall for the taxpayer. As the Bill is a Private Members&#x27; Bill, its referral to Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was required pursuant to the Standing Orders 82A and 118.

In July 2016, the statutory threshold of €13,000 as set out under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 was reduced to €5,000. This was done to facilitate the Bureau in targeting mid-level proceeds of crime.

This Irish model, including the Irish legislation, the innovative multi-agency Criminal Assets Bureau approach, as well as judicial dicta, has played a central role in the expansion of the non-conviction based approach across the common law world.

===Constitutional and human rights debate===
Some have suggested that, for example, a bridal gift from a perpetual tax evader to his daughter might now find itself on the responding end of an order from the CAB. The limits of the legislation are uncertain and accordingly, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and 2005 has been subject to academic review. Writing in 2014, one academic concluded:

Others conclude that civil forfeiture and recovery is a potent crime fighting device:

Civil forfeiture holds with the view that it is not enough to prosecute the perpetrator but recognises the importance of also combatting the driving forces behind the criminal act.

The Supreme Court, however, in reviewing the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 concluded:

Similar legislation in England and Wales has also withstood constitutional scrutiny in its highest courts. In 2014, the Supreme Court of India addressed the issue of whether forfeiture of property violated Article 20 of the Constitution of India. In deciding that forfeiture did not violate the constitution, the Indian Supreme Court cited with approval the Irish High Court decision in Gilligan v Criminal Assets Bureau. It noted that non-conviction based asset forfeiture model was also to be found in various countries: United States of America, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, UK, Australia and certain provinces of Canada. Similar civil forfeiture legislation was found to be constitutional compliant in Bulgaria.

==Ad Hoc Legal Aid==
The Department of Justice operated the CAB Ad Hoc Legal Aid Scheme until 2014. However, from 1 January 2014 the remit for the administration of the Scheme transferred to the Legal Aid Board. The scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the CAB or its Chief Bureau Officer or any member of the CAB, including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, Revenue Acts or Social Welfare Acts.

The scheme also includes:
*social welfare appeals made to the Circuit Court under Section 34 of the Social Welfare Act 1997;
*tax appeals made to the Circuit Court under the Taxes Acts where the CAB or its Chief Bureau Officer or any member of the CAB is the respondent and/or defendant; and
*applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994

The Ad Hoc Legal Aid Scheme provides that the grant of legal aid, including the level of legal representation and/or witness expenses allowed, is a matter for the court with the appropriate jurisdiction to deal with the specific case. The calculation of fees which apply to counsel representing the legally aided person is made in accordance with the mechanism which is in operation under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 and the Regulations made under that Act.

The CAB Ad Hoc Legal Aid Scheme cost €334,000 in 2009, up 18% from the previous year&#x27;s figure of €283,000. It cost €257,000 in 2010.

In October 2014, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggested that the State could cut its criminal legal aid bill by using the Criminal Assets Bureau to carry out a &quot;more thorough&quot; analysis of defendants&#x27; ability to pay.

==Outcomes==
From the Bureau&#x27;s establishment in October 1996 up to end of 2011 the Bureau successfully froze over €70m worth of criminals&#x27; assets. It also collected €137m of the €200m demanded in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. CAB also made social welfare savings of almost €6m and recovered over €2m in fraudulently claimed welfare. According to the Annual Report for 2017, the total amount of funds restrained was in excess of €4.8 million. However, one case currently under investigation accounts for approximately €3.5 million. Tax recovered by the Bureau during 2017 amounted to €2.374m from fifty one individuals / entities and as a result of actions by Social Welfare Bureau Officers, a total sum of €319,720.31 was returned to the Exchequer in 2017.

==International cooperation==
The statutory functions of the Criminal Assets Bureau include the taking of all necessary actions for the purpose of the freezing and confiscation of assets suspected of deriving from criminal activity and that such actions include, where appropriate, subject to any international agreement, cooperation with any police force or any authority outside Ireland which has functions related to the recovery of proceeds of crime.

CAB represents Ireland at the Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network (CARIN), a group which aims to improve informal cross-border and inter-agency cooperation within the European Union and elsewhere. CAB currently sits on the CARIN steering group. The CAB held the presidency of CARIN in 2005 and again in 2013.

EU Council Decision 2007/845/JHA obliges Member States to set up or designate national Asset Recovery Offices (AROs) as national central contact points which facilitate, through enhanced cooperation, the fastest possible EU-wide tracing of assets derived from crime. This Decision was designed to complete the CARIN by providing a legal basis for the exchange of information between Asset Recovery Offices of all the Member States. The Decision allows the AROs to exchange information and best practices, both upon request and spontaneously, regardless of their status (administrative, law enforcement or judicial authority). It requests AROs to exchange information under the conditions laid down in Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA2 (&quot;the Swedish Initiative&quot;) and in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions. Ireland designated the Criminal Assets Bureau as its ARO.

In 2008 a Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group was established by the Northern Ireland Security Minister, Paul Goggins, and operates under the auspices of the Organised Crime Task Force. On this group, which is chaired by HM Revenue and Customs, sits the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency together with the CAB, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána. The Criminal Assets Bureau is also represented on the Joint Agency Task Force, which was created under the &quot;Fresh Start Agreement&quot; to identify strategic priorities for combatting cross-border organised crime and to oversee operational co-ordination.

The CAB is a member partner of Organised Crime Portfolio (OCP) (HOME/2011/ISEC/AG/FINEC/400000222) which is funded by EU Commission, DG Home Affairs and is carried out by an international consortium coordinated by Transcrime – Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan, Italy). The aims of the project are to study the investments of organised crime in European Union Member States, analyse the infiltration of organised crime groups and assess the impact on legitimate markets.

<doc id="1277251" wikidata="Q2356943" url="?curid=1277251" title="HVDC converter station">
<text>An HVDC converter station (or simply converter station) is a specialised type of substation which forms the terminal equipment for a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line. It converts direct current to alternating current or the reverse. In addition to the converter, the station usually contains:
* three-phase alternating current switch gear
* transformers
* capacitors or synchronous condensers for reactive power
* filters for harmonic suppression, and
* direct current switch gear.

==Components==
===Converter===
The converter is usually installed in a building called the valve hall. Early HVDC systems used mercury-arc valves, but since the mid-1970s, solid state devices such as thyristors have been used. Converters using thyristors or mercury-arc valves are known as &quot;line commutated converters&quot;. In thyristor-based converters, many thyristors are connected in series to form a thyristor valve, and each converter normally consists of six or twelve thyristor valves. The thyristor valves are usually grouped in pairs or groups of four and can stand on insulators on the floor or hang from insulators from the ceiling.

Line commutated converters require voltage from the AC network for commutation, but since the late 1990s, voltage sourced converters have started to be used for HVDC. Voltage sourced converters use insulated-gate bipolar transistors instead of thyristors, and these can provide power to a deenergized AC system.

Almost all converters used for HVDC are intrinsically able to operate with power conversion in either direction. Power conversion from AC to DC is called &quot;rectification&quot; and conversion from DC to AC is called &quot;inversion&quot;.

===DC equipment===

The direct current equipment often includes a coil (called a &quot;reactor&quot;) that adds inductance in series with the DC line to help smooth the direct current. The inductance typically amounts to between 0.1 H and 1 H. The smoothing reactor can have either an air-core or an iron-core. Iron-core coils look like oil-filled high voltage transformers. Air-core smoothing coils resemble, but are considerably larger than, carrier frequency choke coils in high voltage transmission lines and are supported by insulators. Air coils have the advantage of generating less acoustical noise than iron-core coils, they eliminate the potential environmental hazard of spilled oil, and they do not saturate under transient high current fault conditions. This part of the plant will also contain instruments for measurement of direct current and voltage. 

Special direct current filters are used to eliminate high frequency interference. Such filters are required if the transmission line will use power-line communication techniques for communication and control, or if the overhead line will run through populated areas. These filters can be passive LC filters or active filters, consisting of an amplifier coupled through transformers and protection capacitors, which gives a signal out of phase to the interference signal on the line, thereby cancelling it. Such a system was used on the Baltic Cable HVDC project.

===Converter transformer===

The converter transformers step up the voltage of the AC supply network. Using a star-to-delta or &quot;wye-delta&quot; connection of the transformer windings, the converter can operate with 12 pulses for each cycle in the AC supply, which eliminates numerous harmonic current components. The insulation of the transformer windings must be specially designed to withstand a large DC potential to earth. Converter transformers can be built as large as 300 Mega volt amperes (MVA) as a single unit. It is impractical to transport larger transformers, so when larger ratings are required, several individual transformers are connected together. Either two three-phase units or three single-phase units can be used. With the latter variant only one type of transformer is used, making the supply of a spare transformer more economical.

Converter transformers operate with high flux Power Steps In the Four Steps of the Converter per cycle, and so produce more acoustic noise than normal three-phase power transformers. This effect should be considered in the siting of an HVDC converter station. Noise-reducing enclosures may be applied.

===Reactive power===
When line commutated converters are used, the converter station will require between 40% and 60% of its power rating as reactive power. This can be provided by banks of switched capacitors or by synchronous condensers, or if a suitable power generating station is located close to the static inverter plant, the generators in the power station. The demand for reactive power can be reduced if the converter transformers have on-load tap changers with a sufficient range of taps for AC voltage control. Some of the reactive power requirement can be supplied in the harmonic filter components.

Voltage sourced converters can generate or absorb reactive as well as real power, and additional reactive power equipment is generally not needed.

===Harmonic filters ===
Harmonic filters are necessary for the elimination of the harmonic waves and for the production of the reactive power at line commutated converter stations. At plants with six pulse line commutated converters, complex harmonic filters are necessary because there are odd numbered harmonics of the orders and produced on the AC side and even harmonics of order on the DC side. At 12 pulse converter stations, only harmonic voltages or currents of the order and (on the AC side) or (on the DC side) result. Filters are tuned to the expected harmonic frequencies and consist of series combinations of capacitors and inductors. 

Voltage sourced converters generally produce lower intensity harmonics than line commutated converters. As a result, harmonic filters are generally smaller or may be omitted altogether.

Beside the harmonic filters, equipment is also provided to eliminate spurious signals in the frequency range of power-line carrier equipment in the range of 30 kHz to 500 kHz. These filters are usually near the alternating current terminal of the static inverter transformer. They consist of a coil which passes the load current, with a parallel capacitor to form a resonant circuit.

In special cases, it may be possible to use exclusively machines for generating the reactive power. This is realized at the terminal of HVDC Volgograd-Donbass situated on Volga Hydroelectric Station.

===AC switchgear===
The three-phase alternating current switch gear of a converter station is similar to that of an AC substation. It will contain circuit breakers for overcurrent protection of the converter transformers, isolating switches, grounding switches, and instrument transformers for control, measurement and protection. The station will also have lightning arresters for protection of the AC equipment from lightning surges on the AC system.

==Others==

===Required area===
The area required for a converter station is much larger than a conventional transformer, for example a site with a transmission rating of 600 megawatts and a transmission voltage of 400 kV is approximately 300 x 300 metres (1000 x 1000 feet). Lower-voltage plants may require somewhat less ground area, since less air space clearance would be required around outdoor high-voltage equipment.

===Location factors===
Converter stations produce acoustic noise. Converter stations can generate serious levels of radio-frequency interference, so include design features to control these emissions. Walls may provide noise protection. As with all AC substations, oil from equipment must be prevented from contaminating ground water in case of a spill. Substantial area may be required for overhead transmission lines, but can be reduced if underground cable is used.

<doc id="1277259" wikidata="Q427198" url="?curid=1277259" title="Pandemonium! (video game)">
<text>Pandemonium! is a 1996 platform video game developed by Toys for Bob and published by Crystal Dynamics for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, mobile and iOS. &quot;Pandemonium!&quot; features Fargus, a joker, and Nikki, a sorceress, who unwittingly casts a spell that destroys the town. The goal of the game is to reach the Wishing Engine, where they can wish the town back to normal. For each level, the player can choose which character to be. Each has a special move – Fargus can deliver a special spinning attack, and Nikki can double jump. The game consists of a great variety of unique gameplay objects, such as watermelons, clouds, spider webs and logs. A sequel, &quot;Pandemonium 2&quot; (&quot;Miracle Jumpers&quot; in Japan), was released in 1997 for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Pandemonium!&quot; employs 2.5D gameplay; while the game renders polygons in a typical 3D fashion, gameplay is 2D. The area of gameplay is as a two-dimensional surface twisting and bending in a three-dimensional world. Occasionally, this surface will overlap itself. There are segments where the path branches, allowing the player to choose their course.

Enemies are generally defeated through the usual platform jumping method of bouncing on the enemy&#x27;s head. There are power-ups located in each level, with varying effects. One is a freeze ray which turns enemies into ice, while another is a shrink ray which reduces the size of enemies to the point where the player character can step on them.

== Plot ==
In the land of Lyr, an unpopular carnival jester called Fargus, and his stick-puppet Sid, are seeking a new career. Meanwhile, a talented acrobat named Nikki, bored of carnival life, runs away to pursue her dream of being a wizard. Fargus, Sid, and Nikki meet at a &quot;Wizards in Training&quot; seminar at Lancelot Castle. The seminar turns out to be rather boring, so during a break Nikki and Fargus steal the speaker&#x27;s spellbook and take it to the high balcony overlooking the village.

When Nikki begins practicing with the magical book, Fargus and Sid urge her to perform a 10th level spell. With a few magical words, a green monster called Yungo appears and consumes the entire village. They search the book for how to get rid of the monster. The book reveals that they&#x27;ll have to obtain a wish from the Wishing Engine. With a map from the book to help them, they set off on their journey.

When they find the Wishing Engine, it tells them to speak three wishes. Fargus wastes the first wish on a chicken (he claims it was just to see if it works) and Nikki then wishes that the village was returned to as it was before the spell was cast. Nikki and Fargus are then teleported back to the top of Lancelot Castle. Yungo spits out the village and is pulled back into his own dimension. Nikki ponders what happened to their third wish, and Fargus guiltily admits that out of desire to share his joy with the world, he wished that everyone back home could be just like him, inadvertently turning everyone in the village into Fargus clones. Nikki and Fargus resign themselves to another trip to the Wishing Engine.

==Development and release==
Work on &quot;Pandemonium!&quot; began in December 1994, starting with two months spent on learning the dynamics of 3D games. The team concentrated on building a prototype level to demonstrate at Electronic Entertainment Expo 1995. Once this was done, set designers and artists were brought on to help create the bulk of the game, bringing the development team up to 30 people. Early in development it was planned to record hundreds of one-liners for the player characters, similar to the earlier Crystal Dynamics game &quot;Gex&quot;.

According to lead designer Paul Reiche III, at the beginning of June 1996 the team decided they wanted the game to be released before Thanksgiving Day of that year and shifted into &quot;high gear mode&quot;. The last 2–3 months of development were devoted to fine-tuning, balancing, and bug-fixing, in particular adjusting the level of detail on levels so as to maintain a consistent frame rate of 30 frames per second.

Having decided to step down as a publisher and focus on development, Crystal Dynamics sold the publication rights for &quot;Pandemonium!&quot; to Electronic Arts once the game was finished. As usual for Crystal Dynamics games, the European publishing rights were given to BMG Interactive. However, BMG decided against publishing the Saturn version, so Sega of Europe purchased the rights from BMG and published that version. The Saturn EU release date was originally slated for May 1997, but was pushed back to June so that a bug could be fixed.

The Saturn, PlayStation and PC versions have 18 levels, while the N-Gage version has 11. In the PlayStation and Saturn versions, progress is saved using a password system. The Japanese version of the game, called &quot;Magical Hoppers&quot;, has considerable changes to the story, characters and cutscenes and is distributed by Bandai.

The PlayStation version was released to the PlayStation Store on October 8, 2009.

==Reception==
The PlayStation version of &quot;Pandemonium&quot; received mixed to positive reviews. Critics generally said that while the gameplay is essentially 2D, the open, airy graphic designs and the exceptional camerawork make it easy for players to be caught in an illusion of 3D. Most found that the gameplay was lacking in innovation, though the diverse and surprising level designs made it enjoyable and relatively fresh. Some critics complained that the &quot;boing&quot; sound which accompanies each jump is annoying. &quot;GamePro&quot; concluded the game to be a mixed bag, and advised gamers to rent it to determine if it fits their interests. Dan Hsu of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; felt it had little to offer besides the graphics, but the other three members of the review team were much more enthusiastic, saying they particularly enjoyed searching out the levels&#x27; secrets. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it a largely negative review, arguing that the level design is flawed and the two playable characters are not differentiated enough. They criticized Burke Tresichmann&#x27;s music for having tracks which are too juvenile and/or similar to his scores for &quot;The Horde&quot; and &quot;Captain Quazar&quot;. However, &quot;GamePro&quot; and Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; opined that the music was both well-done and consistently suited the tone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; summarized that &quot;while &quot;Pandemonium&quot; keeps the player on rails, it&#x27;s still an enjoyable and extremely colorful ride.&quot;

The Saturn version was also well-received, as critics agreed that despite the half a year that had passed since the game&#x27;s release on PlayStation, it still held up well. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; and &quot;Saturn Power&quot; both deemed it the first truly outstanding platform game for the Saturn. &quot;GamePro&quot; said that &quot;It breaks little new ground beyond the cool perspectives, but the gameplay&#x27;s meaty enough to hold your interest.&quot; Sushi-X of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said it &quot;is a step above its PlayStation sibling&quot;, citing tighter controls. However, his co-reviewer Shawn Smith and &quot;GamePro&quot; both felt the PlayStation version was better, due to the port&#x27;s slight decrease in graphical quality, though critics unanimously agreed that Crystal Dynamics had done an overall exemplary job of optimizing the game for the Saturn.

<text>A lift table is a device that employs a scissors mechanism to raise or lower goods and/or persons. Typically lift tables are used to raise large, heavy loads through relatively small distances. Common applications include pallet handling, vehicle loading and work positioning, as well as facilitating assembly operations, maintenance tasks, and product inspection. Lift tables are a recommended way to help reduce incidents of musculoskeletal disorders by correctly re-positioning work at a suitable height for operators. Lift tables lend themselves to being easily adapted to a specific use. They can work in hostile environments, be manufactured in stainless steel and have equipment like conveyors, turn-tables, barriers and gates easily added to their deckplates.

==Use==
Lift tables can come in a vast array of configurations and can be built to suit various highly specialized industrial processes. For instance, they are often customized for integration into production lines, packaging systems, and automated warehouses. The most common lift table design incorporates hydraulic cylinders and an electrically powered pump to actuate the scissor lifting mechanism. Lift tables can also be driven by pneumatic sources, trapezoidal-threaded screw drives, push chains or by hydraulic foot pump when the load is not heavy. The choice of drive mechanism depends on factors such as load capacity, lifting height, speed requirements, and the intended environment. Lift tables can be mounted in a pit for floor-level loading, especially useful for access by manual pallet-pump trucks and the mobility impaired or wheelchair users.

Industries that commonly use lift tables include woodworking, upholstered furniture manufacturing, metalworking, paper, printing and publishing, warehousing and distribution, heavy machinery and transportation.

===Common uses===
Common uses of lift tables include
* Vehicle loading and docking operations
* Mobility impaired access (see below)
* Work positioning and ergonomic handling
* Load positioning (e.g. when integrated into conveyor systems)
* Materials positioning in machine feeding applications
* Pallet and roll cage handling
* Furniture upholstery
* Feeding materials into machinery (e.g., presses, CNC machines)
* Ergonomic workstations in manufacturing and assembly
* Adjusting the height of stage platforms or displays

==Safety==

===Standards===
In Europe there is a published standard BS EN 1570: 1998 + A2: 2009 Safety requirements for lifting tables. Standard EN 1570-1 is now EN 15701-1:2011+A1:2014. It is a Type C standard and compliance with this standard confers conformity with the Machinery Directive, 2006/42/EC. Work is already being undertaken to revise this standard and possibly split it into 3 parts. This revision aims to address new technologies, improve clarity, and enhance safety requirements. It specifies the criteria for the raising and lowering of goods and/or persons associated with the movement of goods carried by lifting tables. 

In North America, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved and published the ANSI MH29.1:2012 standard in February 2012, itself a revision of the previous MH29.1:2008 standard.

===Common accidents===
The most common types of accidents involving a scissor lift caused by misapplication of the machine, obstacles, misuse of the equipment, and lack of maintenance. Other contributing factors include inadequate training, overloading, and failure to follow safety procedures.

<doc id="1277265" wikidata="Q586339" url="?curid=1277265" title="The Man from Barbarossa">
<text>The Man from Barbarossa, first published in 1991, was the eleventh novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond. Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

More so than any previous Bond novel, &quot;The Man from Barbarossa&quot; acknowledges then-current world events. The story begins in January 1991 just prior to the end of the Persian Gulf War, and later includes a description of the early stage of the war against Iraq. Gardner also predicted that hardliners within the Soviet Union might attempt a coup against the government, which did occur later in 1991 but under different circumstances. The book also strongly suggests that the Cold War was soon to end, which did occur that year in December.

John Gardner has stated on many occasions that of the 007 novels he wrote, this is his favourite because it was different and had a more creative approach than all his previous attempts. Additionally, Gardner believes that of all his novels, this was Glidrose&#x27;s favourite as well, although the American publishers took a strong dislike to it. Critics were mixed, with many feeling it was one of Gardner&#x27;s lesser Bond novels.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Man from Barbarossa&quot; begins with a prelude that includes some background information on the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union codenamed Operation Barbarossa, the massacre at Babi Yar that occurred not long after, and information on Josif Voronstov, a fictional character said to be a deputy of real-life Paul Blobel who was primarily responsible for the massacre.

When the story begins, an elderly American living in New Jersey is kidnapped by a Russian terrorist group called the &quot;Scales of Justice&quot;. The man, Joel Penderek, was captured under the belief that he is Josif Voronstov, the war criminal partially responsible for the massacre at Babi Yar.

M is informed by Boris Stepakov of the possibility of infiltrating two Britons into the Scales of Justice. He decides to rely on James Bond and an anomalous collaboration with the Mossad. The Israeli secret service sends Pete Natkowitz to London. Natkowitz brings information that they can prove that Vorontsov and Penderek are in fact two different men and that the Scales of Justice have kidnapped the wrong person and that Mossad has Vorontsov under coverage.

The two secret agents investigate the activities of Stéphanie Adoré and Henri Rampart: two French agents who, during the London night, met with two KGB-connected individuals without unauthorization. The next day James Bond and Pete Natkowitz leave for Moscow where they are greeted by Boris Stepakov.

They discover that the two French agents have kidnapped the real Joseph Vorontsov and handed him over to the Russians who are holding him at a dacha on the Black Sea. Meanwhile, the Scales of Justice have begun assassinating members of the Soviet government.

Through Professor Vladimir Lyko, an English professor who has been converted into a double agent for the terrorist group, they discover that the organization has decided to carry out a mock trial and film it. Their only chance is to send Bond and Natkowitz to the Soviet Union as replacements for a British film crew that Scales of Justice has sent for.

Stepakov has decided to infiltrate 007 and Natkowitz as operators, together with his agent Nina Bibikova who will pose as Bond&#x27;s wife. The girl knows English well and is the daughter of Michael Brooks and Emerald Lacy, British agents infiltrated into the KGB, who died in a car accident a few years earlier.

The three are thus delivered by the professor to the Scales of Justice and taken to an isolated convent near the border with Finland. Lyko is murdered immediately afterwards.

There they are assigned to film a trial against Vorontsov (played by Penderek, who turns out to be a Russian agent), with a whole host of Jewish witnesses. While Bond is busy filming the mock trial (and flirting with Nina), Stepakov is harshly reprimanded by the President of the Soviet Union for the surmounting political assassinations. But the man explains to his interlocutor that he has infiltrated some men and knows where they are. The President authorizes an operation and entrusts it to a Spetsnaz team led by General Gleb Berzin.

Bond discovers that two actors in the process are Michael Brooks and Emerald Lacy the parents of Nina, who were not dead as previously thought. The two say they have infiltrated the terrorist organization and have a plan, but the Bond has doubts. Meanwhile, an important politician of the Soviet Union enters the trial: General Yevgeny Yuskovich, commander in chief of the missile forces. Yuskovich plays the judge at the trial.

Berzin&#x27;s Spetsnaz arrive at convenient time, accompanied by Stepakov and the two French agents. However, its a ploy, as General Berzin and his Spetsnaz are on Yuskovich&#x27;s side, which explains the miraculous assassinations on Soviet politicians. Yuskovich tells that the Scales of Justice was originally a small organization that Yuskovich took the name from to spread misinformation and fear.

The Scales of Justice imprison Stepakov, Adorè, Rampart, the spouses Brooks and Natkowitz. Nina turns out to be Yuskovich&#x27;s lover. One of the Spetsnaz reports that they have found Bond dead, with his face disfigured by a stray gunshot.

After filming, the group moves to Baku where Yuskovich has sold a military arsenal to Iran. The general&#x27;s aim is to exploit the probable war between the United States and Iraq to make Iran hit Washington with a nuclear bomb. By distributing photos of Western agents handing over weapons and explaining to the world how he ended a tragic chapter of history with the mock trial, which would open the way for him to take over the Russian presidency and end perestroika and glasnost.

Weapon boats leave from the port of Baku. On the main boat is the soldier who had found Bond&#x27;s body. But in reality he is 007 himself. He frees his companions and collects weapons. Stepakov dives into the water and manages to sink two ships loaded with explosives before being killed. Rampart is also murdered as he lowers himself into a lifeboat. Bond, Natkowitz and Adorè are about to be hit on their lifeboat when Soviet planes arrive, signaled by a message from 007, which bomb the boats.

Back in London, Bond debriefs M. The United States launches Operation Desert Storm and 007 places a box attributed to him on M&#x27;s desk, which contains the Order of Lenin.

<text>A teardrop trailer, also known as a teardrop camper trailer, is a streamlined, compact, lightweight caravan, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. They usually only have sleeping space for two adults and often have a basic kitchen in the rear.

Teardrop trailers first became popular in the 1930s, when magazines such as &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; published DIY construction plans. The first teardrop designs incorporated standard sheets of plywood with hardwood spars. Teardrop trailers remained popular until the mid-1960s, after which they disappeared from mainstream camping. However, in the late 1990s, plans became available on the Internet and in recent years teardrop trailers have made a resurgence and are again growing in popularity.
A teardrop trailer is generally small, ranging from to in width and to in length. They are usually to in height. Wheels and tires are usually outside the body and are covered by fenders. Since teardrop trailers are so light, usually less than , just about any car can tow one and fuel consumption is minimally affected. 
There is room inside a teardrop trailer for two people to sleep, as well as storage for clothes and other items. Outside, in the rear under a hatch, there is usually a galley for cooking. Teardrop trailers tend to have lighting and other electrical power supplied by a storage battery, although some have mains power hookups like regular travel trailers.

Teardrop trailers are featured in &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; Episode 6001 with Huell Howser.

<text>Galactic is an American funk band from New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Origins and background==
Formed in 1994 as an octet (under the name Galactic Prophylactic) and including singer Chris Lane and guitarist Rob Gowen, the group was soon pared down to a sextet of: guitarist Jeff Raines, bassist Robert Mercurio, drummer Stanton Moore, Hammond organist Rich Vogel, Theryl DeClouet on vocals, and later adding saxophonist Ben Ellman.

The group was started when Raines and Mercurio, childhood friends from affluent Chevy Chase, Maryland, moved to New Orleans together to attend college at Tulane and Loyola Universities, became enamored of the local funk scene, populated by such legendary acts as The Meters and Dirty Dozen Brass Band and inspired by local legends such as Professor Longhair. There they teamed with noted New Orleans drummer Stanton Moore, saxophonist/harmonica (now producer) Ben Ellman, Rich Vogel, and Theryl de Clouet. In 2004, the band parted ways with vocalist DeClouet, and continued as an instrumental group until 2007 when they released &quot;From the Corner to the Block&quot; featuring rappers ranging from Juvenile, Chali 2na, Boots Riley, and Lyrics Born. They continue to tour with different vocalists: 2011 and 2012 with Cyril Neville, 2011 through 2014 with Corey Glover, 2014 with Maggie Koerner, from 2015 with Erica Falls. They have also toured with trombonist Corey Henry from 2009 through 2016 and trumpet player Shamarr Allen from 2016. They have been releasing albums consistently since 1996.

==Musical style==
The band has developed a unique sound as a result of their influences, including: rock, funk, brass band, blues, jazz, hip hop, electronic, and world music. Many of their songs include performances by other artists of various styles of music, like hip-hop artists Boots Riley (of The Coup), Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious) and Chali 2na (of Jurassic 5), to vocalists Macy Gray, Mavis Staples, Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas, David Shaw, Mystikal, Mannie Fresh, and JJ Grey &amp; Mofro. On the European version of From the Corner to the Block there are two tracks more than on the US version. One of those tracks (&quot;Valley Of Pain&quot;) features the German rapper Dendemann.

==Evolution==
The band&#x27;s sound has evolved from organic New Orleans funk to a more modern style, incorporating elements of hip hop, electronica, fusion, and jazz. This change has been largely characterized by the increased use of electronic effects on guitar, bass, saxophone, and drums. Drummer Stanton Moore uses phrase samplers to sample a rhythm which he can then play over, producing intricate and layered drum sounds. Ben Ellman, saxophonist and harmonica player, often distorts his instruments to the degree that they sound similar to an electric guitar. In 2007, the band began to produce their own albums (mainly Ben Ellman and Robert Mercurio). This opened them up to more studio experimentation and exploration resulting in their loop, edit and production heavy album &quot;Ya-Ka-May&quot;.

== Tipitina&#x27;s ==
The band has long considered the legendary New Orleans music venue Tipitina&#x27;s an unofficial home base, having recorded a live album there, and having performed there regularly since the beginning of their career. This includes annual performances on Halloween, New Year&#x27;s Eve, during the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, and a yearly &quot;sunrise set&quot; on Lundi Gras (the day preceding Mardi Gras), appropriately playing until the sun rises on Mardi Gras day. In 2018, the members of the band made their association with the venue official, purchasing the venue from the previous owners, Mary and Roland Von Kurnatowski.

==Live performances==
The band is also noted for inviting guest musicians from New Orleans to perform onstage with them. These include: the Soul Rebels Brass Band, The Neville Brothers, Brian Seeger, Corey &quot;Boe Money&quot; Henry, George Porter of The Meters, Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Skerik (a saxophone player who is actually based in Seattle, Washington, but is part of Stanton Moore&#x27;s side project Garage A Trois). The band is often on tour, and have shared the stage with acts including Live, Counting Crows, the Allman Brothers Band, The Roots, Fusebox Funk, Widespread Panic, B.B. King, Mike Doughty (formerly of Soul Coughing), Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious), Jurassic 5, Jack Johnson, Gov&#x27;t Mule, The Revivalists, The Record Company, Trombone Shorty and Orleans Ave, Toots and the Maytals, and Steel Pulse.

Galactic performed &quot;I Got It (What You Need)&quot; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; in 2007. They also performed &quot;Back That Ass Up&quot; and &quot;Rodeo&quot; as Juvenile&#x27;s band on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2006. Galactic toured North America in 2012 with Corey Glover and Soul Rebels Brass Band. On March 29, 2012, Galactic appeared with Soul Rebels Brass Band and Corey Glover on &quot;Conan&quot; show on TBS .

In 2015, they performed Summer Festivals in the US, Canada, and Japan with vocalist Macy Gray. While on their 2016 tour, Galactic performed on a marine themed call-in talkshow, FishCenter Live. They correctly guessed the coloration of a squirrelfish and won points for a zebra moray eel, Eel Hamburger. They headlined the 11th annual Rooster Walk Music and Arts Festival in Martinsville, VA in May 2019.

==Recent releases==
&quot;Ya-Ka-May&quot; was released on February 9, 2010, on ANTI-. The album includes guest performances by a range of New Orleans musicians. Long-established performers such as Rebirth Brass Band, Irma Thomas, Big Chief Bo Dollis of The Wild Magnolias, Allen Toussaint and Walter &quot;Wolfman&quot; Washington are represented, along with younger performers in the traditional vein, such as Trombone Shorty and Corey Henry, John Boutté, Josh Cohen and Ryan Scully of Morning 40 Federation, and Glen David Andrews, and also Bounce artists Cheeky Blakk, Big Freedia, Katey Red, and Sissy Nobby.

Galactic released a live album in May 2011 titled &quot;The Other Side of Midnight: Live in New Orleans&quot;.This album includes live versions of many songs on &quot;Ya-Ka-May&quot;.

On February 21, 2012, Galactic released a new studio album titled &quot;Carnivale Electricos&quot; which focused on the theme of Carnivale. They invited artists from New Orleans to flesh out the diversity of the town&#x27;s music in a virtual Fat Tuesday strut across town: the battle chant of Mardi Gras Indian War Chief Juan Pardo and the Golden Comanches; the voice of Mystikal; and the 40-piece Kipp Renaissance High School marching band. For &quot;Voyage Ton Flag&quot; they sampled the late accordionist Clifton Chenier and carnival-rock number &quot;Hey Na Na (Hey Na)&quot; with David Shaw of New Orleans&#x27;s Revivalists. Brazil is represented by samba poet Moyseis Marques on &quot;O Coco da Galinha&quot; and by Casa Samba, who retake the forro &quot;Magalenha...&quot; The LP has been described by the band as &quot;a tour&quot; through New Orleans&#x27; various styles of music. 

On July 17, 2015, Galactic released a new studio album titled &quot;Into the Deep&quot;. It featured Macy Gray, J.J. Grey, David Shaw, Maggie Koerner, and Mavis Staples.

On February 8, 2019, Galactic released their latest studio album, &quot;Already Ready Already&quot;, via Tchoup-Zilla Records. It was produced by Galactic&#x27;s own Robert Mercurio and Ben Ellman, and marks the band&#x27;s 10th studio LP. The album features guest appearances from Erica Falls, Princess Shaw, Miss Charm Taylor, David Shaw (The Revivalists), Nahko, and Boyfriend.

On February 7, 2020, Galactic released a single titled &quot;Float Up&quot;. The track features Anjelika &quot;Jelly&quot; Joseph.

In 2023, Galactic released &quot;Tchompitoulas&quot;, an EP which includes singer Anjelika &quot;Jelly&quot; Joseph, trumpeter Eric Gordon, Afro-Cuban musician Cimafunk, trombonist and singer Glen David Andrews, and rapper Eric Biddines.

<doc id="1277287" wikidata="Q3876697" url="?curid=1277287" title="Death Is Forever">
<text>Death Is Forever, first published in 1992, was the twelfth novel by John Gardner to feature Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including Gardner&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

&quot;Death Is Forever&quot; is significant as the first James Bond novel to be published after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, two elements that were part and parcel of Bond&#x27;s creation 40 years earlier.

More than most other Gardner novels, &quot;Death Is Forever&quot; is grounded in contemporary events, with the fallout from the end of the Cold War and the failed 1991 Russian coup being important backdrops to the story. The Eurotunnel connecting England and France, which was still under construction at the time the book was written, also serves as a major setting.

==Plot summary==
In Frankfurt, a veteran spy codenamed Vanya is killed, and a week later another codenamed Eagle is killed in Berlin, both in ways reminiscent of old-time assassinations. Both were also parts of a now defunct spy network, the Cabal. Bond, along with American desk agent Elizabeth Zara St. John, M and Bill Tanner go through Vanya and Eagle&#x27;s last days, to understand how they could be tracked down.

To find out if any of the remaining members of the Cabal are traitors, Bond and Easy must take on the roles of Vanya and Eagle and travel to Berlin. In the shadows, villain Wolfgang Wiesen plans reintroducing Josef Stalin&#x27;s type of communism.

Bond soon discovers he is being followed, but is interrupted when Easy is caught off guard by one of the few remaining Cabal members, Oscar Vomburg. They manage to convince him that they are harmless and that he needs to put them in touch with Praxi Simeon, who was the Cabal&#x27;s coordinator. While Vomburg tries to get hold of Simeon, Bond and Easy manage to avoid food that is full of &quot;fiddleback&quot; spiders.

Soon after, Vomburg is found dead, and the next Cabal member, Harry Spraker, makes contact. They ride the Ost-West Express train towards Paris. After successfully breaking free from two of Wiesen&#x27;s men on the train, Bond decides he doesn&#x27;t trust Spraker and they split up at the Paris station. Bond shadows Spraker and sees him meeting an unknown man, but is captured by two French agents, who do not want foreign agents on their soil. He is released on condition that he leaves the country and goes straight to Simeon, where the real Spraker is also found.

Simeon, Spraker and a third Cabal member, Bruin, know that one of Wiesen&#x27;s bases is in Venice, and that he has sworn revenge on the Cabal. They head there, separately. Bond then meets another Cabal member, Gus Wimper, with whom he forms a temporary alliance when Easy, Simeon, Spraker and Bruin are captured by Wiesen&#x27;s men. Bond and Wimper try to free the four, but are captured themselves, whereupon Bond is taken to Wiesen and interrogated.

Afterwards, he is taken to a cell in the basement, where the entire gang is to be killed before Wiesen and his men depart and carry out their grand plan. Bond manages to free them and capture Wiesen, though not without Easy being killed. They take Wiesen towards Calais, where his plan is to take place, but additional henchmen attack them and carry off the sedated Wiesen, with only Bond and Simeon surviving.

Bond realizes that the plan involves the not-yet-completed Channel Tunnel between France and Great Britain, where the EU&#x27;s twelve prime ministers will meet at the premiere of the Eurostar. With the help of French GIGN soldiers, Bond succeeds in preventing the plan to blow up the train and kill the dignitaries, preventing a political vacuum.

Once home, Bond is attacked by Wiesen&#x27;s wife, but manages to escape after an even knife fight.

<doc id="1277289" wikidata="Q7912831" url="?curid=1277289" title="Valve hall">
<text>A valve hall is a building which contains the valves of the static inverters of a high-voltage direct current plant. The valves consist of thyristors, or at older plants, mercury arc rectifiers. Mercury arc rectifiers are usually supported by insulators mounted on the floor, while thyristor valves may be either supported by insulators or hung from the roof of the valve hall. The latter requires a stronger ceiling structure, however the hall and the static inverter can better survive earthquakes compared to valve structures standing on the floor.

A valve hall is equipped with heating and cooling equipment to control the temperature of the mercury arc rectifiers (which operate best over a narrow temperature range) or thyristors. The valve hall also protects the valves from weather and dust. Several valve assemblies, connected in a series for the required terminal voltage, may be installed in the valve hall building.

High voltage bushings are supported through the walls of the valve hall, to allow connections between the converter transformers on the one side and the DC switchyard on the other. Beside the valve hall there is often an additional building, in which are control electronics, equipment for valve cooling and valve monitoring, station service power distribution, and amenities for the plant workers.

Because of high voltages, access to the valve halls is limited while the static inverter is running. The auxiliary control building may have windows to observe the valve hall, but usually the converter is remotely controlled. To protect communication systems from electromagnetic interference, valve hall buildings must have shielding installed to control emission of radio-frequency energy.

At some HVDC converters such as at Cabora-Bassa, outdoor valves are installed in oil-immersed containers. At such plants no valve halls or wall bushings are required.

<doc id="1277302" wikidata="Q3876690" url="?curid=1277302" title="Never Send Flowers">
<text>Never Send Flowers, first published in 1993, was the thirteenth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including Gardner&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

==Plot summary==
Four people, seemingly unrelated, are killed in different ways, by different killers. In Switzerland, a fifth person, MI5 agent Laura March, is murdered, again in a new way. Since the Swiss police do not want MI5 to investigate a case in which they may be involved, James Bond is assigned to follow the investigation.

He is met by the Swiss agent Fredericka &quot;Flicka&quot; von Grüsse. She tells him that March had gone to Switzerland to meet her brother David, which surprises Bond because March has no siblings. However, it turns out that March lied because her brother went crazy and murdered several people. He had died in prison, leaving Bond and Flicka still wondering who March had met the last few times in Switzerland.

Bond and Flicka investigate find a letter from March to David. They send a copy to London and while they wait they make love. The next morning they discover that someone stole the letter. After informing his boss, Bond goes with Flicka to the mountain where March died and learns that the Swiss police discovered that the suspected killer arrived as one person and left as another, with a distinctive stick.

Before Bond and Flicka have time to act further, they learn that they have been disconnected from the case, due to the carelessness of the letter. Bond then takes a month off. He soon discovers that MI5 is shadowing him, and through a deception maneuver he manages to meet one of the MI5 agents he has come to trust.

She says that March&#x27;s last boyfriend was David Dragonpol, the best British actor since Laurence Olivier, who recently retired for unknown reasons to his castle on the river Rhine. When Bond leaves for a meeting with Flicka, he becomes a suspect in the murder of the MI5 agent. Bond goes to the police who have been instructed by Bond&#x27;s boss, M, to release him.

The next step is to go to March&#x27;s funeral, where someone has sent a hybrid red and white rose, just like the one sent to the previous four murders. Bond decides to take Flicka to Dragonpole&#x27;s castle. Once there, they meet Dragonpol and his sister, Maeve, who together turn out to be preparing a giant theater museum.

Flicka tells Bond about the Swiss police&#x27;s suspicions of Dragonpol as a terrorist, but the final clue is Maeve Dragonpol&#x27;s interest in hybrid roses. They escape through Dragonpol&#x27;s theater museum and find plans indicating that there will be attacks in Milan, Athens and Paris: against Kiri Te Kanawa, Yassir Arafat and some they cannot identify. However, they lose track of Dragonpol who can be anywhere, with any appearance.

M gives Bond and Flicka the new mission to become sacrificial lambs for Dragonpol in Milan. After a short time he attacks - his twin brother, the real David Dragonpol. In interrogations with M and several others, the twin brother, Daniel Dragonpol, reveals that David was born deaf and mute and was therefore kept a secret by the family, but regained hearing and speech after an accident. He became obsessed with becoming the best actor, but had also started assassinating people. The murder of his brother was Daniel Dragonpol&#x27;s way of escaping guilt.

Soon it turns out that it was only a ruse and that he fled, just like Maeve did. Bond figures out where Dragonpol is going, to Eurodisney, where he is going to kill Princess Diana and her two sons. He sets up a defense plan, but is outwitted by Dragonpol. Bond still manages to kill Dragonpol and foil the attack.

In conclusion, Bond opens up about a possible wedding with Flicka.

<text>Kelvin Tavares Cato (born August 26, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player. A 6&#x27;11&quot; center from the University of South Alabama and Iowa State University, Cato played in the NBA as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, Houston Rockets, Orlando Magic, Detroit Pistons, and New York Knicks.

== College career ==
Cato was an obscure player averaging six points and six rebounds at the University of South Alabama in 1992–93. At that time, he struck up a relationship with then University of New Orleans coach Tim Floyd, who recognized Cato&#x27;s potential. In 1994, Floyd took over as head coach at Iowa State University and convinced Cato to transfer to Iowa State. Cato averaged 11 points, eight rebounds and four blocks per game for an Iowa State team that reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 1997 NCAA basketball tournament.

== NBA career ==
Drafted 15th overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks, Cato&#x27;s draft rights were immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for the draft rights to Chris Anstey and cash considerations. Cato averaged 3.8 and 3.5 points per game in his two seasons in Portland before being bundled in a six-for-one deal with the Houston Rockets that sent Scottie Pippen to the Blazers.

He spent five years in Houston, averaging a career-high 8.7 points per game in 1999–2000, and started all but two of the games he played in both the 2001–02 and 2003–04 seasons. On October 28, 1999, Cato signed a six-year, $42,000,000 contract extension that increased in controversy as his playing statistics cooled. With Yao Ming as the Rockets&#x27; new starting center, the Rockets traded Cato in a seven-player deal that sent Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley, and Cato to the Orlando Magic for Tracy McGrady, Juwan Howard, Tyronn Lue, and Reece Gaines. While he started 50 games in the 2004–05 season for the Magic, his playing minutes went down significantly the following season as he battled shoulder injuries.

On February 15, 2006, Cato, along with the Magic&#x27;s first-round pick in the 2007 NBA draft, was traded to the Detroit Pistons for center Darko Miličić and point guard Carlos Arroyo. Cato finished out the season with the Pistons. He signed with the New York Knicks for the 2006–07 season.

<text>The siege of Sevastopol, also known as the defence of Sevastopol () or the Battle of Sevastopol (; ), was a military engagement that took place on the Eastern Front of the Second World War. The campaign was fought by the Axis powers of Germany and Romania against the Soviet Union for control of Sevastopol, a port in Crimea on the Black Sea. On 22 June 1941, the Axis invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, with Axis land forces reaching the Crimean peninsula in the autumn of 1941 and overrunning most of the area. The only objective not in Axis hands was Sevastopol. Several attempts were made to secure the city in October and November 1941. A major attack was planned for late November, but heavy rains delayed it until 17 December 1941. Under the command of Erich von Manstein, Axis forces were unable to capture Sevastopol during this first operation. Soviet forces launched an amphibious landing on the Crimean peninsula at Kerch in December 1941 to relieve the siege and force the Axis to divert forces to defend their gains. The operation saved Sevastopol for the time being, but the bridgehead in eastern Crimea was eliminated in May 1942.

After the failure of their first assault on Sevastopol, the Axis opted to conduct siege warfare until the middle of 1942, at which point they attacked the encircled Soviet forces by land, sea, and air. On 2 June 1942, the Axis began this operation, codenamed &quot;Störfang&quot; (Sturgeon Catch). The Soviet Red Army and Black Sea Fleet held out for weeks under intense Axis bombardment. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) played a vital part in the siege, its 8th Air Corps bombing the besieged Soviet forces with impunity, flying 23,751 sorties and dropping 20,528 tons of bombs in June alone. The intensity of the German airstrikes was far beyond previous German bombing offensives against cities such as Warsaw, Rotterdam or London. At the end of the siege, there were only 11 undamaged buildings left in Sevastopol. The Luftwaffe sank or deterred most Soviet attempts to evacuate their troops by sea. The German 11th Army suppressed and destroyed the defenders by firing 46,750 tons of artillery ammunition on them during &quot;Störfang&quot;.

Finally, on 4 July 1942, the remaining Soviet forces surrendered and the Germans seized the port. The Soviet Separate Coastal Army was annihilated, with 118,000 men killed, wounded or captured in the final assault and 200,481 casualties in the siege as a whole for both it and the Black Sea Fleet. Axis losses in &quot;Störfang&quot; amounted to 35,866 men, of whom 27,412 were German and 8,454 Romanian. With the Soviet forces neutralized, the Axis refocused their attention on the major summer campaign of that year, Case Blue and the advance to the Caucasus oilfields.

==Background==

The Soviet naval base at Sevastopol was one of the strongest fortifications in the world. Its site, on a deeply eroded, bare limestone promontory at the southwestern tip of the Crimea, made an approach by land forces exceedingly difficult. The high-level cliffs overlooking Severnaya Bay protected the anchorage, making an amphibious landing just as dangerous. The Soviet Navy had built upon these natural defenses by modernizing the port and installing heavy coastal batteries consisting of 180mm and 305mm re-purposed battleship guns which were capable of firing inland as well as out to sea. The artillery emplacements were protected by reinforced concrete fortifications and 9.8-inch thick armored turrets.

The port was a valuable target. Its importance as a potential naval and air base would enable the Axis to conduct far-ranging sea and air operations against Soviet targets into and over the Caucasus ports and mountains. The Red Air Force had been using the Crimea as a base to attack targets in Romania since the Axis invasion in June 1941, proving its usefulness as an air base. Likewise, the Wehrmacht had launched a bombing raid on the Sevastopol naval base at the start of the invasion.

Since the beginning of &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, the offensive against the USSR had not really addressed Crimea as an objective. German planners assumed the area would be captured in mopping-up operations once the bulk of the Red Army was destroyed west of the Dnieper river. But in June, attacks by Soviet aircraft from Crimea against Romania&#x27;s oil refineries destroyed 12,000 tons of oil. Hitler described the area as an &quot;unsinkable aircraft carrier&quot; and ordered the conquest of Ukraine and Crimea as vital targets in Directive 33, dated 23 July 1941.

The &quot;Command of the Army&quot; (OKH) issued orders that the Crimea was to be captured as soon as possible to prevent attacks on Romanian oil supplies, vital to the German military. Hitler, impatient with obstruction to his commands to advance in the south, repeated on 12 August his desire that the Crimea be taken immediately. Over a month later, during the capture of Kyiv, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; (General Colonel) Erich von Manstein was given command of the German 11th Army on 17 September. After only a week in command, he launched an assault upon Crimea. After severe fighting, Manstein&#x27;s forces defeated several Soviet counteroffensives and destroyed two Soviet armies. By 16 November, the Wehrmacht had cleared the region, capturing its capital Simferopol, on 1 November. The fall of Kerch on 16 November left only Sevastopol in Soviet hands.

By the end of October 1941, Major-General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov&#x27;s Independent Coastal Army, numbering 32,000 men, had arrived at Sevastopol by sea from Odessa further west, it having been evacuated after heavy fighting. Petrov set about fortifying the inland approaches to Sevastopol. He aimed to halt the Axis drive on the port by creating three defence lines inland, the outermost arc being 16 km (10 mi) from the port itself. Soviet forces, including the Soviet 51st Army and elements of the Black Sea Fleet, were defeated in the Crimea in October and were evacuated in December, leaving Petrov&#x27;s force as Sevastopol&#x27;s main defence force. Having cleared the rest of the Crimea between 26 September – 16 November, the Romanian 3rd Army and German 11th Army prepared for an attack on the port. The German 11th Army was the weakest on the entire front, initially containing only seven infantry divisions. The Romanians contributed a large force, but were only lightly equipped and generally lacked heavy artillery. The weather turned against the Axis in mid-October and torrential downpours delayed the buildup. This gave Vice Admiral Filipp Oktyabrsky, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, time to bring in men and materiel from Novorossiysk. By 17 December, the weather had cleared sufficiently for the Axis to begin a major operation.

==Forces involved==

===Axis===
The German 11th Army, commanded by Manstein, besieged Sevastopol. At the time of the final assault in June 1942, 11th Army consisted of nine German infantry divisions in two Corps, and one Romanian Corps, being the Romanian 7th Mountain Corps. Significant support was given by the Luftwaffe. The &quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot; dispatched &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; (Air Fleet 4) 8th Air Corps for support. It consisted of nine &quot;Geschwader&quot; (Wings) containing 600 aircraft, all coming under the command of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen. Among this contingent was a powerful concentration of medium bomber, dive bomber, and torpedo bomber &quot;Geschwader&quot;.

Naval support came from the Italian 101st Squadron under Francesco Mimbelli. It consisted of four motor torpedo boats, five explosive motorboats, six CB class midget submarines, and a number of 35-ton coastal submarines and MAS boats. This force was the only Axis naval force deployed during the siege. It had been requested by the Germans—the only time during the war that the Germans spontaneously requested Italian assistance. Although Bulgaria was not technically at war with the Soviet Union, its naval staff worked closely with the Wehrmacht, and despite not being committed to combat, they provided bases for the Axis naval command (&quot;Admiral Schwarzes Meer&quot;, Admiral of the Black Sea) to operate in the waters of the Black Sea.

===Soviet===

The defence of Sevastopol was provided mainly by the Black Sea Fleet and the Separate Coastal Army under Petrov (which had been shipped in from the siege of Odessa). The Black Sea Fleet sent 49,372 personnel to fight as infantry. Most were not trained for ground combat, and the act was an ad hoc emergency measure. The naval brigades formed had four to six battalions of 4,000 men, allowing them to absorb significant losses. These forces were well armed, having a variety of artillery and mortar battalions. Almost 20 percent of the Coastal Army were naval personnel. In the Separate Coastal Army, the strongest divisions were the 95th, 109th, 172nd, and 388th Rifle Divisions. They each had around 7,000 soldiers, the rest of the Red Army units having around 5,000 personnel. Some 5,000 reinforcements made it into Sevastopol in May 1942. However, Petrov&#x27;s army lacked tanks and anti-aircraft guns. The garrison also lacked food supplies and mortar ammunition, which would severely sap Soviet strength. Poor communications between headquarters and the front lines were also an issue. Petrov found it difficult to respond to Axis attacks quickly.

==First Axis offensive==
The German 11th Army&#x27;s first task was to break through into the Crimea. The cities of Perekop and Ishun guarded the narrow corridor of land which linked the Crimea to the bulk of Ukraine. Erick-Oskar Hansen&#x27;s LIV Corps, with its 45th and 73rd Infantry Divisions, broke through at Perekop at the cost of 2,641 casualties in six days of fighting. The Soviet forces launched a counteroffensive against the 11th Army&#x27;s flank at Melitopol. Manstein withdrew his other corps in order to deal with it. The resulting battle ended with the destruction of two attacking Soviet Armies. By the time that this threat had been dealt with, the &quot;Stavka&quot; had rushed in reinforcements and established another defence line at Ishun. Ordered to concentrate on the Crimea once more, Manstein launched his LIV Corps, this time with the support of the German 22nd Infantry Division, into the assault. The Soviet forces enjoyed local air superiority and armored reserves. They also outnumbered the attacking Wehrmacht. In spite of this, the defending Soviet 51st Army was pushed back. The Wehrmacht suffered 5,376 casualties in 12 days of combat, and the Red Army many more. By the end of October, the 51st Army was crushed and in full retreat into the Crimea. The situation in the air also changed. Arriving &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; (Fighter Wings) won air superiority for the Axis.

On 22 and 23 October, &quot;Jagdgeschwader 3&quot; (JG 3), &quot;JG 52&quot;, and &quot;JG 77&quot; crippled the Soviet air strength in the Crimea. Over the two days they destroyed 33 Soviet aircraft for one loss. In the six days from 18 to 24 October 140 Soviet aircraft were lost, 124 of them to Luftwaffe fighters. Heinkel He 111s of &quot;KG 26&quot; and &quot;KG 51&quot; and Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stukas&quot; of StG 77 were free to attack Soviet ground positions, contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Crimean Front on 27 October.

===Sevastopol offensive===

====Initial battles====

With the front collapsing and the Axis closing in on Sevastopol, Vice-Admiral Oktyabrsky assumed command of the port on 4 November 1941. The city had a civilian population of 111,000 in 1941, and most were sent to work on the three defence lines around the port. Only the 7th and 8th Naval Infantry Brigades were available for combat in the port. More naval infantry were formed from ships in the harbor. The 8th Naval Infantry Brigade was sent to guard the northeastern approaches near the Mamachai-Belbek line. The 7th (5,200 men) was deployed in the center, near Mekenzyya. With only 20,000 soldiers, Oktyabrsky relied heavily on his 12 coastal battalions to slow down the Axis. The 62nd Fighter Brigade contributed 61 fighters, which were able to achieve temporary air superiority.

On 30 October, the Soviet defences detected the spearhead of the German 132nd Infantry Division and shelled it at 12:30 on 1 November using Battery 30&#x27;s 305mm coastal guns. The Germans designated the fort as Fort Maxim Gorky I. Wehrmacht lacked sufficient air and mobile units to force a decision. Instead, Manstein ordered Hansen&#x27;s LIV Corps to head east down the Sevastopol-Simferopol rail line towards Yalta, while the 72nd Infantry Division was to head to Balaklava, effectively encircling Sevastopol. Once there, it would attack Sevastopol from the east. The 132nd made reasonable progress, but was stopped on 2 November by the 8th Naval Brigade. The Wehrmacht suffered 428 casualties. Manstein ordered a halt for a week, whilst bringing up reserves. Oktyabrsky used his fleet to bring in a further 23,000 men from the Caucasus. On 9 November, Petrov&#x27;s Army was brought in, bringing 19,894 soldiers, ten T-26 tanks, 152 artillery pieces, and 200 mortars. The Red Army now had 52,000 troops in the area of the city. The Luftwaffe was considered weak (the bulk of it was engaged in the Battle of Moscow), so the Soviet Navy kept the heavy cruiser &quot;Krasny Kavkaz&quot;, light cruisers &quot;Krasny Krym&quot; and &quot;Chervona Ukraina&quot;, and seven destroyers to protect the port.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; did what it could to disrupt the Soviet defences. On 31 October, the destroyer &quot;Bodryy&quot; shelled German positions along the coastline. StG 77 Ju 87s attacked and wounded 50 of its crew by strafing its deck and superstructure with machinegun fire. On 2 November Junkers Ju 88s of &quot;KG 51&quot; scored several hits on the cruiser &quot;Voroshilov&quot; and put it out of action for months. On 7 November He 111s from &quot;KG 26&quot; sank the liner &quot;Armeniya&quot; evacuating soldiers and civilians from Sevastopol, with only eight of the 5,000 passengers surviving. On 12 November, &quot;StG 77&quot; sank the cruiser &quot;Chervona Ukraina&quot; and &quot;KG 26&quot; damaged the destroyers &quot;Sovershennyy&quot; and &quot;Besposhchadnyy&quot;. But with the Luftwaffe units being dispatched to other sectors and theatres, the Soviet forces again achieved air superiority with 59 aircraft (39 serviceable).

Manstein wanted to launch an attack as soon as possible, but his logistical lines were poor. Wanting to avoid strong Soviet forces protecting the north of the port, including the 95th Rifle Division, Manstein chose to press the center and southern Soviet defences. He ordered the German 50th Infantry Division to probe the center of the Soviet line east of the Chernaya river. The 132nd Infantry Division supported the probe and was able to push to within 4 kilometres of Severnaya Bay. The 72nd Rifle Division, with the support of the coastal batteries, moved in to stop the attack. The 72nd Infantry Division continued towards Balaklava, and the 22nd Infantry Division joined the assault. Assisted by shelling from two light cruisers and the battleship &quot;Parizhskaya Kommuna&quot;, the Red Army halted this attack, and Manstein called off the offensive on 21 November, having lost 2,000 men.

====December offensive====

Manstein recognised that he could not take the port quickly, and was going to have to organise a proper set-piece offensive. With German offensive operations suspended in December, Manstein found himself the only commander on the Eastern Front with an offensive mission. He was not ready to carry out his attack until 17 December. In the meantime, Oktyabrsky used the interval to sail the 11,000 soldiers of the 388th Rifle Division into Sevastopol between 7–13 December. Soviet engineers began laying extensive minefields and barbed-wire belts. By the time of the Axis attack, Petrov&#x27;s force held a strong defensive position. The naval commander demanded that Petrov hold the coast along the northern flank of Sevastopol on the Belbek River in order to retain Coastal Battery 10, an artillery complex near Mamaschai. On the other hand, the German LIV Corps had only 15,551 men in its four infantry divisions (22nd, 24th, 50th, and 132nd). Over 7,000 soldiers in the German 11th Army were on the sick list at that time. It was also short of artillery ammunition and heavy artillery. In order to commit as many forces to the battle as possible, Manstein left the weak XLII Corps, containing just the 46th Infantry Division and two Romanian brigades, to protect the entire front from Yalta to Kerch.

The attack began at 06:10 on 17 December. The 22nd Infantry Division attacked the 8th Naval Brigade on the Belbek River, pushing west towards the coast, while the 50th and 132nd Infantry Divisions conducted fixing attacks on the Soviet center. The 22nd succeeded in rolling up the flank of the Naval Brigade after five days of fighting. However, Oktyabrsky ordered its retirement south towards Sevastopol, abandoning Mamaschai and forming a new front north of Belbek city and the Belbek river. In the south, XXX Corps tried and failed to break through with the 72nd and 170th Infantry Divisions. Only minor gains were made against the 172nd Rifle Division, even with help from the Romanian 1st Mountain Brigade. The 79th Naval Brigade and 345th Rifle Division arrived by sea as reinforcements, using the long winter nights and their naval superiority. Meanwhile, the battleship &quot;Parizhskaya Kommuna&quot; shelled German forces whenever they threatened a breakthrough. The offensive came to an abrupt end when the Red Army staged an amphibious landing at Kerch.

===Kerch landing===

Between 26 and 30 December 1941, the USSR launched an amphibious assault on the Kerch peninsula to relieve the encircled Soviet forces at Sevastopol. It succeeded in gaining and sustaining a bridgehead for five months. However, a German−led counteroffensive named Operation Bustard Hunt destroyed the bridgehead and the three Soviet Armies supporting the landing in May 1942. This allowed Manstein to concentrate all of his resources against Sevastopol for the first time. The front over Sevastopol grew quiet and a stalemate ensued. The Luftwaffe kept up the pressure on Soviet sea communications and although supplies still made it through, Vice Admiral Oktyabrsky, commanding the Black Sea Fleet, was forced to reduce the number of coastal bombardment missions.

==Second Axis offensive==

===Unternehmen Störfang===

====Soviet defence====
Sevastopol was still a formidable obstacle. Its airfields provided a base for the Red Air Force to attack the Axis-held Soviet coastline and Romania proper. It was also home to the Black Sea Fleet. Its main fortifications were pointed seaward, while the land defences encircled the city at a distance of 15–20 km, with an inner defense belt at a range of 5 km. Enhancing the manmade defences was the forested, rugged terrain. To the north of Severnaya Bay there were 11 batteries and strongpoints. They were given morale-boosting names such as &quot;Stalin&quot;, &quot;Maxim Gorky I&quot;, &quot;Molotov&quot;, and &quot;Lenin&quot;. They were defended by the First Coastal Army. Elsewhere, the Red Army had constructed hundreds of timber bunkers with machinegun nests and 45 mm anti-tank artillery. Along the outer belt, concrete bunkers were less common, 19 being stretched across its 37 km. Soviet engineers laid thousands of mines, including PMD-6 wooden anti-personnel mines, TMD-40 wooden anti-tank mines, and barbed-wire obstacle belts.

Petrov, commanding the Independent Coastal Army, had a powerful artillery pool. Petrov had on strength some 455 artillery pieces and howitzers. Among those were 34 152 mm and 40 122 mm howitzers and 918 mortars. Ammunition was adequate for a battle of two weeks for these calibers, but 82 mm mortar ammunition was in short supply. The battles of the Crimean campaign had taken their toll, and scarcely any tank and anti-aircraft artillery support were available. A further force, under Major-General Petr Morgunov, was added. The Coastal Artillery Force was semi-independent for much of the siege, and had an initial strength of 12 batteries and 45 guns, although more were added during 1942. By the time of the German June offensive, the Soviet forces had available eight 305 mm, one 188 mm, 10 152 mm and 17 130 mm, three 120 mm, eight 100 mm, and four 45 mm guns.

====Axis forces====

By this time, the Axis was facing a serious manpower and artillery shortage. The German 11th Army&#x27;s divisions had anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of their initial strength. The German 22nd Infantry Division was the strongest division, and was only short 1,750 personnel, while the weakest was the 132nd Infantry Division, which was short 2,300 men. The 170th Infantry Division had to collapse one of its regiments to bring the others up to strength. The German infantry force was a fragile force at Sevastopol and Manstein could not afford to squander it. German doctrine stressed bypassing strongpoints, but since this was not possible, German infantry were forced to reduce one fort after another. Some 65 Sturmgeschütz III assault guns were available to support them.

The assault was based around battalion-strength infantry assault groups supported by a platoon of engineers and a few assault guns. Two pioneer battalions were attached to each division to spearhead the attack and break through fixed and fortified defences. The eight battalions of LIV Corps each contained around 386 men on average, and were equipped with 10–12 flame throwers, 28–30 mine detectors, 3,000 kg of high explosives, 2,200 hand grenades, and 500 smoke grenades. The 300th Panzer Battalion, a remote-controlled tank unit using the Goliath tracked mine, was made available for destroying fortifications. The total number of artillery pieces came to 785 German and 112 Romanian medium and heavy guns. Most of these were under the command of LIV Corps, the main assault force. To increase this arsenal, a number of super-heavy artillery pieces were made available. Three 600 mm Karl-Gerät self-propelled mortars (&quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Odin&quot;, and one other) and one 800 mm gun (&quot;Schwerer Gustav&quot;), delivering 1.4 and 7 ton shells, respectively, and capable of destroying any fortification. However, the Karl-Gerät guns only had a range of between 4–6,000 meters, which made them vulnerable to counter-battery fire. Moreover, only 201 rounds of 600 mm and 48 round of 800 mm ammunition were available. Most of it was used up before the infantry assault.

More useful to the German infantry were the two 280 mm railway guns. Two 420 mm, two 355 mm howitzers were also available, along with four 305 mm mortars. Both of the 420 mm guns were of First World War vintage, short in range and with limited ammunition. Some nine 283 mm mortars were also available, but they were pre-1914 weapons and six had burst during firing. Artillery acquired from Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement, the Skoda 305 mm Model 1911 howitzer was also available. At the divisional level, 268 105 mm and 80 150 mm weapons were in service, including 126 Nebelwerfer infantry barrage rocket launchers. Overall, the German 11th Army&#x27;s artillery was a collection of modern, obsolete, and foreign-built weapons. For the offensive, 183,750 rounds of 105 mm and 47,300 rounds of 150 mm ammunition were stockpiled, enough for 12 days of firing.

To reinforce the 11th Army, the Romanians were committed to the assault. The Romanian 18th Infantry Division was at full strength, and plenty of Romanian infantry were available. However, the 18th Division was inexperienced and made up of reservists. The Romanian 1st Mountain Division was considered an elite force, and its addition was to prove useful. They had 112 guns available, but virtually no engineers. The weakness of their artillery and supporting arms made the Romanian X Corps reliant on the German forces for anything other than set-piece infantry attacks.

The Luftwaffe had to compensate for the Axis artillery limitations. A powerful air armada was brought together. Under the 8th Air Corps, von Richthofen assembled six &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; (Bomber Groups) originating from six different &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; (Bomber Wings): KG 51 &quot;Edelweiß&quot;, KG 76, KG 100, and III.&quot;Gruppe&quot;/LG 1 specialist training wing. Dive-bomber support from StG 77 was also given to Richthofen. He could call upon three &quot;gruppen&quot; of Ju 87s. &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; (Fighter Wings) JG 3 &quot;Udet&quot; and JG 77 &quot;Herz As&quot; were available for air superiority operations. II.&quot;Gruppe&quot;/KG 26 &quot;Löwe&quot; was also available for anti-shipping operations, in addition to the air-land effort carried out by the 8th Air Corps.

The Luftwaffe could not support the land assault and maintain pressure on Soviet sea communications alone. With only KG 26 engaged in anti-shipping operations against Soviet sea communications, the OKW looked to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to supply &quot;Schnellboot&quot; (S-Boat) motor torpedo boats to help eliminate Soviet shipping supplying and evacuating the port. The time it took to dismantle and move the 92-ton boats by rail to Romanian ports was going to be too long. In a rare appeal for help, the German forces turned to their Italian allies, aware of their expertise with motor torpedo boat operations. The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; sent the 101st Naval Squadron, which brought nine torpedo boats and nine coastal submarines under the command of the highly competent Capitano di Fregata Francesco Mimbelli. The Italian boats were only 24 tons and the submarines were 35 tons, which made them easier to transport by truck and barge. The squadron was based at Feodosiya and Yalta, which made it the only Axis naval force to participate in the siege. It mainly engaged in offensive operations against Soviet supply efforts.

===Battle===

====Air offensive====
Manstein demanded an all-out assault by the Luftwaffe before the main ground action began. Situated only 70 km from Sevastopol, the German formations had barely enough time to reach altitude before reaching their targets. The 8th Air Corps began its bombing campaign along the north and southeast of the city. At the same time, German medium bombers conducted rolling attacks on the city, which included all units except LG 1, which engaged in suppressing anti-aircraft installations. Oil, electricity, water pumps, harbor facilities, and submarine bases were attacked by StG 77 Ju 87s. Von Richthofen watched the bombing from an observation post close to the front. The targets were badly damaged, and fires broke out all over the port city. The Luftwaffe flew 723 missions and dropped 525 tons of high explosive on the first day. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, just one Ju 87 was lost.

While the bulk of the Luftwaffe was busy with the land battle, III./KG 26 sought to break Soviet sea communications. They sank the tanker &quot;Mikhail Gromov&quot;, but the flotilla leader &quot;Tashkent&quot;, the destroyer &quot;Bezuprechnyy&quot;, and transport &quot;Abkhaziya&quot; escaped to bring 2,785 soldiers into the fortress. Air support continued with 643 sorties on 3 June 585 on 4 June, and 555 on 5 June, with some German crews flying daily averages of 18 missions. By the start of the ground attack on 7 June, the Luftwaffe had flown 3,069 sorties and 2,264 tons of high explosive and 23,800 incendiary bombs were dropped. Many of the bombs dropped were 1,000 kg SC 1000, 1,400 kg SC 1400, and 2,500 kg SC 2500 bombs. The heavy-caliber weapons were aimed at Soviet concrete bunkers. Ivan Laskin, commanding the 172nd Rifle Division in the northern sector recalled, &quot;Bombers in groups of twenty to thirty attacked us without caring for their targets. They came in, wave after wave, and literally ploughed up the earth throughout our defence area. German aircraft were in the air above our positions all day long. The sky was clouded by smoke from explosions of thousands of bombs and shells. An enormous dark grey cloud of smoke and dust rose higher and higher and finally eclipsed the sun&quot;. The German air campaign against Sevastopol in June 1942 surpassed by far the German bombings of Warsaw, Rotterdam or London. From 3 to 6 June, the Luftwaffe carried out 2,355 operations and dropped 1,800 tons of high explosives.

On 7 June, Manstein ordered the ground assault. The Luftwaffe carried out 1,368 sorties and dropped 1,300 tons of bombs on Soviet positions, but the Soviet infantry clung on.

====Ground fighting: 7–10 June====
LIV Corps was to strike the main blow. Situated on the northeast edge of the city, they struck along the lines of least resistance, across the Belbek river while the German XXX and Romanian Mountain Corps conducted holding attacks in the south and center, respectively. Both the latter corps did not start major operations until 8 June.

The artillery bombardment targeted bunkers with 105 mm fire, which usually received 10–25 rounds. German Flak 36 37 mm guns also did an effective job of eliminating machinegun nests. The German forces were also quick to bring up 88 mm artillery guns to fire directly into bunker apertures. Between 2 and 6 June, the German 11th Army expended nine percent of its munitions (42,595 rounds, amounting to 2,449 tons of munitions) on pre-advance shelling. The railway guns also fired a few rounds at the main fortifications and rail lines, but most missed by some distance. The closest shell landed 80 meters away from its target. Soviet ammunition dumps were also targeted by these weapons, with no effect. The main fortifications, forts &quot;Stalin&quot;, &quot;Molotov&quot;, and &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; (which lay in the path of LIV Corps) remained active. It was not until the afternoon of 6 June when a single 60 cm calibre mortar shell from the Karl-Gerät self-propelled mortar no. III, nicknamed &quot;Thor&quot;, knocked out &quot;Maxim Gorky&#x27;s&quot; second turret, damaging the weapon. This was the only success of the German super-heavy guns, which did not have an impact commensurate with their expense. The Luftwaffe had a greater impact, using its Ju 87s to knock out the communications systems of the fort.On the morning of 7 June 1942, the German infantry began advancing cautiously. XXX Corps attacked the southern positions held by the 7th Naval Brigade and 388th Rifle Division. The German infantry advanced behind air and artillery support. The infantry seemed afraid of their fire support and did not advance close enough behind it. The bombardment also failed to have enough of an effect. The Soviet forces held their fire until the German forces were well within range before opening fire, and little progress was made. Von Richthofen was angered by the fear of the infantry and called the day &quot;a real disappointment&quot;. The next few days were not much better, despite the Luftwaffe flying 1,200 sorties. The pace of operations exhausted the machines and men. Often crews did not get out of their aircraft and made three or four sorties without rest.

LIV Corps began its assault in the north on the seam of the Soviet defence sectors III and IV. The &#x27;Schwerer Gustav&#x27; weapon continued to fire against ammunition dumps, which produced no effect. Nevertheless, the 132nd Infantry Division was able to work its way up to the river. The 600 mm guns concentrated on the coastal batteries and &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; fortress. Meanwhile, the German 22nd Infantry Division attacked further to the east. Some 200 Soviet reinforcements of the 79th Naval Infantry Brigade, protecting this sector, were lost in the bombardment, but the main defences held out. The brigade held most of its forces in reserve, while committing only a single company to cover the hilly terrain on the Belbek river front. German assault groups breached the first and reserve lines by 08:15. The German forces had to negotiate heavily mined areas, slowing them down and allowing the Soviet forces to make a partial recovery. Supporting operations by the 50th and 24th German Infantry Divisions failed, which cost the Wehrmacht 12 StuG assault guns. The remote-control demolition units were not effective as the terrain was unsuitable.

By 17:15 the town of Belbek was secured. The 22nd Infantry Division made considerable progress in breaking through the defenses of the 25th Rifle Division. The 50th Infantry Division supported the 22nd&#x27;s left flank. Now facing the Germans was the Haccius Ridge, on which the fortress &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; was located. It was flanked by several smaller forts to the east.

Now the 132nd Infantry Divisions was ordered to conduct a converging pincer movement on the &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; fortress in conjunction with the 22nd and 50th Infantry Divisions, to trap its defenders against the coast. The 132nd pushed into the 95th Rifle Division&#x27;s positions north of the fort, while the other two divisions attacked in a flanking move. While the Germans did make progress, nearing the main railway station just southeast of &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot;, they were stopped from achieving a full-scale breakthrough by the 172nd Rifle Division. The 22nd and 50th Infantry Divisions had been heavily shelled by mortar fire from the 25th Rifle Division facing them east of the Haccius Ridge, which caused heavy casualties. By 18:00 hours, the German attack was spent.

LIV Corps&#x27; losses on 7 June amounted to 2,357 casualties in four divisions, including 340 killed. It had also expended 3,939 tons of ammunition. The 132nd Division had exhausted all of its basic munitions load by midday. On the other side, the formidable Soviet defence lines east and southeast of Belbek had been overrun, and the Germans succeeded in advancing 2 km through dense Soviet defences. The Soviet casualties had also been severe. It is estimated that three battalions were effectively destroyed.

Manstein recognised the seriousness of the failure on 8 June. He was worried that the 132nd Infantry Division, locked in combat with the 79th Naval Brigade and 95th and 172nd Rifle Divisions north of the city on the Belbek river front, was &quot;approaching the end of its strength&quot;. Once again, the army turned to the Luftwaffe for support. Richthofen responded by ordering attacks against Soviet supply lines. The same day, German bombers, including KG 100, began attacks on Soviet shipping. They sank the destroyer &quot;Sovershennyy&quot; and the survey vessel &quot;Gyuys&quot;, with the 4,727 ton transport &quot;Abkhaziya&quot; and destroyer &quot;Svobodnyy&quot; following them on 10 June.

The period between 8–12 June descended into a battle of attrition. Several Soviet counterattacks were repulsed with heavy losses. The German LIV Corps extended the salient on the seam of the III and IV sector to 3 km, determined to break through before Petrov could reinforce his lines. The 132nd Infantry Division cleared the Haccius Ridge while the 22nd Infantry Division overran most of the Soviet 79th Naval Infantry Brigade. The Soviet unit tried counterattacking on 10 June, but was repulsed. The Soviet formation was effectively destroyed, with the support of the Luftwaffe, which used anti-personnel bombs against Soviet infantry caught in the open. Only one battalion (the Soviet 1st Batt./241st Rifle Regiment) was in a position to block the Germans from encircling the &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; fort. Still, on 8 June LIV Corps had lost 1,700 men. In return, the lodgement in Soviet lines was extended to 3 km deep and 5 km wide.

In the south, XXX Corps made no progress in four days of attacks. They suffered 496 casualties at the hands of the 109th Rifle Division. The 28th Light and 72nd Infantry Divisions had succeeded in puncturing the Soviet lines opposite the 109th and 388th Rifle Divisions. The outer defences were broken in some parts, but the most were still in Soviet hands on 12 June. The main belt on the Sapun Ridge (Sapun-gora) was unbroken. Soviet casualties amounted to 2,500, including 700 captured. By 13 June, XXX Corps had lost 2,659 men, including 394 killed.

====Air-land operations: 11–15 June====

As the Germans made slow progress toward the main train station, Petrov withdrew the battered 172nd Rifle Division and replaced it with 345th Rifle Division. The 95th Rifle Division halted the 132nd Division&#x27;s progress in the north. Although a relatively quiet day, 10 June saw the elimination of the Soviet 79th Naval Brigade and LIV Corps lost 2,772 men. Counterattacks by the Soviet 345th Division aimed at the hinge between the German 132nd and 50th Divisions were repulsed by the Luftwaffe. On 11–12 June, LIV Corps lost another 1,957 men. The Red Army had committed all of its reserves and were stretched dangerously thin. One more push might collapse the northern sector. But at this time, the tired German infantry were running short on reinforcements and ammunition.

In contrast, the Black Sea Fleet was bringing in reinforcements through Luftwaffe attacks. On 12 June the cruiser &quot;Molotov&quot; and destroyer &quot;Bditel&#x27;nyy&quot; brought in 2,314 soldiers, 190 tons of ammunition and 28 artillery pieces. The Luftwaffe turned its attention to these convoys. On 13 June it sank the transports &quot;Gruzyia&quot; and &quot;TSch-27&quot;, patrol boat &quot;SKA-092&quot;, motor boat &quot;SP-40&quot;, five barges, and a floating crane. On 15 June another 3,400 soldiers, 442 tons of ammunition, 30 tons of fuel and 12 tons of provisions reinforced the Soviet positions.

The Luftwaffe had flown 1,044 sorties on 11 June, dropping 954 tons of bombs. The consumption rate of ammunition was putting von Richthofen&#x27;s logistical network under strain and he could no longer afford to fly massed bombing raids. On 11 June, he surmised there was less than two days worth of munitions left, requiring a change of tactics. Instead of carpet bombing, fewer targets would be attacked simultaneously, and aircraft would strike at designated targets in long and narrow lines. This was designed to maintain accurate pressure without wasting ordnance. Even this failed to alleviate shortages in the long term. By 17 June, scarcity of aviation fuel meant the Luftwaffe dropped only 800 instead of the planned 1,000 tons of bombs. Adding to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s troubles in the sector, von Richthofen was transferred to prepare the Corps&#x27; Headquarters near Kursk to support the upcoming Operation Blue, the German summer offensive in southern Russia. He retained formal command, at least until given control of Luftflotte 4, but Wolfgang von Wild took over air operations over Sevastopol.

The primary objective for the 22nd Infantry Division on 13 June was Fort Stalin, blocking the advance to Severnaya Bay. It was a tough position. The fortifications allowed the Soviet forces to concentrate artillery against breakthroughs and machine gun posts protected the fort from southern and eastern attacks, but it was vulnerable from a northern assault. In addition, only 200 men from the 345th Rifle Division were stationed there. The Germans launched their assault on the position at 03:00 on 13 June with just 813 men. The 3rd Battalion was assigned to suppress Soviet machine gun and mortar positions located on the southeast as a diversion. The 1st Battalion, supported by five StuG assault guns, two 37mm guns and an Engineer Company, were to serve as the main effort. Some 200 and 110 men were committed respectively in each unit.

German bombardment began on 12 June. Artillery fire from &#x27;Dora&#x27; had failed to neutralise the fort. Nevertheless, a combined arms attack from eleven 420 mm mortars and dive-bombing by Ju 87s of StG 77 knocked out the fort&#x27;s main armament (three of the four 76.2 mm guns). At 19:00 the 22nd divisional artillery began shelling the fort and its smaller supporting fortress, Volga, located to Stalin&#x27;s rear, with 210, 280 and 305 mm weapons. At 03:00 the German infantry attacked. The fog of war intervened. The Soviet mortar teams were not suppressed, and a fierce battle developed which lasted until 05:30. The Germans, with the support of five assault guns and a few 37 mm weapons, silenced the fort, bunker by bunker. In the heavy fighting a large number of company commanders were killed.

As the Germans seized this vital fort, the neighbouring Volga fort realised it had fallen and shelled the position. A company-sized counterattack by the Soviet forces was wiped out by German small arms fire. The Germans declared the position secured at 07:00, though some bunkers held out until 15:00. German casualties amounted to 32 dead, 126 wounded and two missing – half of the force committed. Soviet casualties amounted to 20 captured, the remainder were killed. With only 91 men left near the fort, Petrov did not order a recovery attempt – a grave mistake.

The fall of Fort Stalin meant the Soviet defenses in the north were on the verge of collapse. Hansen ordered LIV Corps to divert its attention to Fort Maxim Gorky and the elimination of the Soviet 95th Rifle Division. The 95th Rifle Division had been halting the 132nd Infantry Division&#x27;s progress since the start of the offensive. The 132nd was reinforced by one regiment from the idle 46th Infantry Division near Kerch. The German 24th, 50th and Romanian 4th Mountain Divisions were to maintain pressure in the central sector while they pushed towards the Mekensia and Gatani Valley and the Chernaya River opening at Severnaya Bay. For three days, 14–16 June, the battle continued as the Axis advanced towards Sevastopol in the face of Soviet resistance. On 15 June the 132nd was within 900 metres of the Maxim Gorky&#x27;s outer bastion (Bastion I). The front opposite the 25th Soviet Rifles was still strong, but the northern flank was giving way. The 79th Naval Brigade had only 35 percent of its fighting strength remaining. Blocking the way to Maxim Gorky were just 1,000 men of the 95th Rifle Division and 7th Naval Brigade.

In the south the Soviet 109th and 388th Rifle Divisions were forced back along the coast by the German 72nd and 170th Infantry Divisions while the Romanian Corps&#x27; 18th Mountain Division dislodged the Soviet 386th Rifle Division threatening XXX Corps&#x27; right flank. The battles continued to grind on until 20 June. In six days, XXX Corps had lost 2,646 men. In exchange the outer defences of the 388th Rifle Division had been broken and the formation effectively destroyed. Still, the German advance on Balaklava had been halted. The Germans had not yet reached its outer defences and the Sapun Ridge to the east of the town was still under Soviet control. By 15 June, some 1,000 Soviet soldiers and 1,500 mortar bombs had been captured, indicating the Soviet forces had plenty of ammunition after two weeks of battle.

Despite shortages of aviation fuel and ordnance, the Luftwaffe had played a significant part in the success of the German operations. From 13 June until 17 June, it flew 3,899 sorties and dropped 3,086 tons of bombs. This average of 780 sorties per day was only a slight drop from the opening 11 days. Massed sorties were made on the city of Sevastopol itself. Bombing targeted hangars, port facilities, flak and artillery batteries, barracks, and supply depots with high explosive bombs. Most of the city was engulfed in flames. The smoke rose to 1,500 meters and stretched as far as Feodosiya, 150 kilometers away.

====Ground fighting: 16–28 June====

As Hansen poised his corps for the breakthrough against the 95th Rifle Division, 27 Ju 87s of II./StG 77 attacked Maxim Gorky&#x27;s main battery. The Germans believed the strike had knocked it out as it stopped firing its artillery. The artillery bombardment began on 16 June. In the morning the attack by the reinforced 132nd Division collapsed the line. The Soviet garrison held out in tunnels, capitulating on 20 June.

The 22nd and 24th Infantry Divisions advanced from the northeast. They employed their Goliath remote control demolition vehicles with success against the timber bunkers. One exploded prematurely and two were knocked out by a minefield. Two Panzer III control vehicles were knocked out by Soviet anti-tank fire. By 19:30, Forts Maxim Gorky, Molotov, Schishkova, Volga and Siberia were overrun. The 24th Infantry Division in particular made extensive use of its Nebelwerfer rockets. The 95th and 172nd Rifle Divisions had been lost, as well as the majority of the fortified defences. Only the 25th Rifle remained in the line. Petrov rushed up the 138th Naval Brigade with an extra 2,600 men, which was landed on 12–13 June. It prevented German forces reaching Severnaya Bay that day.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was also engaged in applying pressure to Soviet naval forces. On 18 June the cruiser &quot;Kharkov&quot; was severely damaged. Attacks on 19 June by KG 51 destroyed the anti-aircraft platform in Severnaya Bay, allowing air operations to continue unopposed. The lack of anti-aircraft cover made it impossible for the minelayer &quot;Komintern&quot; to enter the harbour with reinforcements. The lack of supplies resulted in Soviet ammunition and fuel supplies slipping to critical levels on 20 June. The Luftwaffe was experiencing shortages of its own. The daily average of sorties was now reduced by 40 percent. Due to the shortages of bombs, all ordnance had to be dropped individually to minimise wastage. Some experienced crews had to conduct dive-bombing attacks 25–30 times a day. KG 51&#x27;s Ju 88 crews in particular had felt the strain.
The pressure took its toll, and between 18 and 23 June, the entire Soviet defence line in the north collapsed. The remnants of the 95th Rifle Division was huddled into a 2 km square portion of coast line near Coastal Battery 12, north of the Bay. At 09:00 the battery and the division surrendered to the 132nd Infantry Division. Further south the 24th Infantry Division captured Bartenyevka, on the mouth of the Bay. The 22nd Infantry Division had reached the north of the Bay on the same day. The Soviet 138th Naval Brigade counterattacked, but it was destroyed without artillery and air support. On 20 June, the 24th Infantry Division tackled the main obstacle remaining on the north side of the Bay. The Lenin anti-aircraft position protected by the Northern Fort, a position which had a 5 metres wide anti-tank ditch, 1,000 mines, 32 concrete bunkers, seven armoured cupolas, and 70 earth-and-timber bunkers making it a formidable defensive position. The Lenin defences surrendered, having already lost three of their four 76 mm weapons. The Germans tried to use the remote-controlled mines to break into the North Fort, but they were knocked out. At 11:30 on 21 June the Fort fell after a sustained infantry attack. Around 182 Soviet prisoners were taken. The Germans began mopping up operations and clearing the northern shore. Most Soviet units were exhausted and out of ammunition, surrendering quickly. Others made attempts at a last stand. Some tried to evacuate across to the southern side by boat, but they were picked off by German artillery.

While the main actions were playing out in the north, XXX Corps alternated between attack and defence. The Soviet forces held the Sapun Ridge and could observe German movements. On occasion they could deliver effective counter battery fire. Between 21 and 28 June, the Germans lost 10 artillery pieces, including five 150 mm s. FH 18 medium howitzers. In the centre, the Romanians took up the slack. The 18th Infantry, 1st, and 4th Mountain Divisions, supported by 100 guns, gradually advanced up the Chernaya River towards the mouth of the river and Severnaya Bay. With support from LIV Corps on its left, the Axis captured all the Soviet defensive lines east of the Chernaya River.

The Luftwaffe had contributed 4,700 sorties in seven days up until 26 June. They dropped 3,984 tons of bombs. The daily average sorties had decreased 15 percent from the week before and 10 percent the week before that. The increasing operational readiness (49.8 to 64.5 percent) revealed the severity of bomb and fuel shortages. Von Wild, despite the withdrawal of some &quot;Geschwader&quot; for Operation Blue, did succeed in bringing in much needed reinforcements to bring the strength levels up to a standard not seen since the start of the offensive. The Luftwaffe continued the intense bombardment. On 26 June, its attacks supporting XXX Corps, devastated Soviet defences on the Sapun Ridge. It was the last Soviet defensive line between the Axis and Sevastopol.

====Axis land, sea and air offensive: 29 June====
A flanking attack by German assault boats on 29 June succeeded in taking the fortified southern shore of Severnaya Bay, greatly diminishing resistance against the capture of the city and harbor of Sevastopol.

====Fall of Sevastopol: 30 June – 4 July====
Oktyabrsky and Petrov were flown out at the last moment. Major General Pyotr Georgyevich Novikov took command of the defense. On 30 June, LIV Corps launched a heavy assault, supported by heavy &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombardment and several dozen guns. Heavy fighting took place for the next three days, but it was becoming clear that the Red Army could not hold their increasingly untenable positions for more than a day, at most. On 3 July, the last line of Soviet defense was breached. The following day, the last of the Soviet defenses were overrun and all organised resistance collapsed. The few remaining Red Army units continued to put up scattered resistance to the south of the city, which lasted until 9 July.

The fall of Sevastopol was announced by a special radio communique:
Above the city and port flutter the German and Romanian flags. German and Romanian troops under the command of Colonel General von Manstein, steadfastly supported by Colonel General von Richthofen&#x27;s battle-hardened air corps, after twenty-five days of fierce battle, have as of midday today, taken the most powerful land and sea fortress of all that have ever existed in the world.

==Aftermath==

The Germans claimed that over 90,000 Red Army soldiers had been taken prisoner, and a greater number killed. This claim appears to be overstated as, according to Soviet sources, the Soviet garrison defending Sevastopol totaled 106,000 men at the start of the siege plus 3,000 reinforcements during the attack. Further, it is known that 25,157 persons were evacuated, the overwhelming majority either wounded soldiers or officers evacuated on Stalin&#x27;s orders.

Romania&#x27;s contribution was honored when the Crimea Shield in gold was first bestowed upon Marshal Ion Antonescu on 3 July 1942. It was awarded to him in Bucharest by Manstein, on Hitler&#x27;s behalf. The second and last Golden Krimschild was awarded to Manstein himself, on 24 November 1942.

From 2 June to 3 July 8 Air Corps had flown 23,751 sorties and dropped 20,528 tons of bombs. German artillery had fired a further 46,750 tons of munitions, with total Axis munitions consumption coming to 67,278 tons over the course of one month. The Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 611 motor vehicles, 123 aircraft of which 18 on the ground, 38 artillery pieces, 10 tanks, a locomotive and a flak barge. Further destroyed were 48 Soviet artillery batteries, 28 barracks and industrial buildings, 20 bunkers, 11 ammunition depots, 10 fuel depots, a bridge and an observation post. Hundreds more motor vehicles had been damaged along with 7 artillery pieces, 43 artillery batteries, 2 barracks and another bridge. German aerial attacks had sunk 10,800 tons of Soviet shipping including 4 destroyers, a submarine, 3 motor torpedo boats, 6 coastal vessels and 4 freighters. 12,000 tons of shipping were also damaged, with 2 destroyers, 10 coastal vessels and 2 freighters among the losses.

Although ultimately a German success, the operation took much longer than the Germans had expected. Operation Blau, Army Group South&#x27;s advance toward Stalingrad and the Caucasus, was just beginning, and the German offensive did not have the 11th Army to support it. Instead, the German 6th Army under Paulus was without crucial support, ultimately contributing to its defeat.

<text>Truls Olaf Otterbech Mørk (born 25 April 1961) is a Norwegian cellist.

== Biography ==
Mørk was born in Bergen, Norway to a cellist father, John Fritjof Mørk, and a pianist mother, Turid Otterbech. His mother began teaching him the piano when he was seven. Mørk also played the violin, but soon switched to the cello, taking lessons from his father.

Mørk began his studies with Frans Helmerson at 17 at Edsberg Music Institute. An admirer of Mstislav Rostropovich and the Russian school of cello, Mørk went on to study with the Russian cellist Natalia Shakhovskaya.

In 1982, Mørk became the first Scandinavian musician to reach the finals of the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow since Arto Noras in 1966, and won the sixth prize. He subsequently went on to win second prize at the 1986 Naumburg Competition in New York City and, in 1986, the Cassado Cello Competition in Florence. In 1989, he embarked on his first major concert tour, soloing with many of the finest orchestras of Europe. In 1994, he toured the United States with the Oslo Philharmonic, including debuts at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center.
Mørk&#x27;s discography includes an award-winning recordings of the Shostakovich Cello Concertos and of Bach&#x27;s Suites for Solo Cello. He has recorded for such labels as Virgin Classics and harmonia mundi. Mørk&#x27;s interest in chamber music led to the foundation of the International Chamber Music Festival of Stavanger.

In April 2009, Mørk experienced an infection of the central nervous system, presumably caused by a tick bite he received in the United States in 2006, with subsequent encephalitis, and paralysis in the shoulder muscles of the left arm. In the autumn of 2009, he expressed concern that he might never be able to perform again. After 18 months away from concert activity, during which time he was awarded the 2010 Sibelius Prize, Mørk resumed his career. 

Mørk holds a Professorship at the Norwegian Academy of Music, Oslo. For more than 30 years, he performed on a rare &quot;Domenico Montagnana&quot; cello (Venice, 1723), whose scroll was made by Stradivarius. Norway&#x27;s SR-Bank purchased the cello, and loaned it to him. The instrument was recently bought by the Dkfm. Angelika Prokopp Privatstiftung, which now loans it to cellist Harriet Krijgh.

<text>Charles Ferguson Smith (April 24, 1807 – April 25, 1862) was an American military officer who served in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War and the Utah War. He served as a Union Army major general during the American Civil War. 

He served as commandant of cadets of the United States Military Academy from 1838 to 1843. During the American Civil War, he served in the Army of the Tennessee under Ulysses S. Grant, who was a student of his at the military academy. Smith was instrumental in Grant&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Fort Donelson but died in April 1862 due to infection of a non-combat leg injury and subsequent dysentery.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born on April 24, 1807, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Samuel B. Smith and Margaret Ferguson. His paternal grandfather was the Presbyterian church minister John Blair Smith. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1825.

==Career==
He was commissioned second lieutenant and assigned to the 2nd U.S. Artillery at Fort Delaware and then at the Augusta Arsenal from 1827 to 1829. He returned to the military academy in 1829 and served on the faculty as an instructor of tactics under Ethan A. Hitchcock. He was appointed Commandant of Cadets (second in authority to the academy superintendent) and promoted to first lieutenant. He served in that position from 1838 to 1843.

He distinguished himself as an artillery battalion commander in the Mexican–American War and served under both Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott at the Battle of Palo Alto, the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, the Battle of Monterrey, and the Battle of Churubusco. He received brevet promotions from major through colonel for his service in these battles and at the end of the war was a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army of the United States. He commanded the police guard in Mexico City from the end of the war to 1848. He was an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847.

He commanded the Red River Expedition (1856) from 1856 to 1857, and served under Albert Sidney Johnston in Utah from 1857 to 1860. He commanded the Army&#x27;s Department of Utah in the Utah Territory, from 1860 to 1861.

===American Civil War===
After the outbreak of the American Civil war, Smith briefly led the Department of Washington at Fort Washington, Maryland, through 1861, and served on recruiting duty in New York City. On August 31, 1861, he was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers and on September 9, 1861, as colonel of the 3rd Regular U.S. Army Infantry. He was transferred to the Western Theater and given command of the Western District of Kentucky. He served as a division commander in the Department of the Missouri under newly recommissioned Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, who had been one of his pupils decades before at West Point. This potentially awkward situation was eased by Smith&#x27;s loyalty to his young chief.

Smith led his division in the attack on the Confederate right flank at the Battle of Fort Donelson. His units fought until nightfall and pushed back the 30th Tennessee Infantry. His troops held the captured terrain which soon forced the Confederate defenders to surrender. When the Southern forces sent a request to discuss terms of surrender, General Smith was quoted as saying &quot;no terms to the damn rebels&quot;, advice that Grant softened to, &quot;No terms except unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted&quot;, which made him known throughout the Northern newspapers as U.S. &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant.

When theater commander Major General Henry Halleck, became distrustful and perhaps envious of Grant, he briefly relieved him of field command of the Army&#x27;s expedition up the Tennessee River, and gave that responsibility to Smith. However, Halleck soon restored Grant to field command (intervention by 16th President Abraham Lincoln may have been a factor).
Smith suffered a serious leg injury while jumping into a rowboat that forced him to miss the Battle of Shiloh, where his experience was sorely missed. Smith died on April 25, 1862, at Savannah, Tennessee, from infection of the leg injury and subsequent dysentery. He was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

The untimely death of Gen. Smith forced Grant to partner with General William Tecumseh Sherman, and build a partnership with him that would eventually win the war.

==Personal life==
Smith married Francis Mactier on March 24, 1840.

==Legacy==
Three forts were named in his honor. The first Fort C. F. Smith was built in 1863 as part of the perimeter defenses of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. The second, Fort C.F. Smith, was part of the Civil War defenses of Bowling Green, Kentucky. The third Fort C. F. Smith was built in 1866 at the Bighorn River crossing of the Bozeman Trail in the southern edge of the Montana Territory from 1864 to 1889.

<doc id="1277346" wikidata="Q7393020" url="?curid=1277346" title="TLS acceleration">
<text>TLS acceleration (formerly known as SSL acceleration) is a method of offloading processor-intensive public-key encryption for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to a hardware accelerator.

Typically this means having a separate card that plugs into a PCI slot in a computer that contains one or more coprocessors able to handle much of the SSL processing.

TLS accelerators may use off-the-shelf CPUs, but most use custom ASIC and RISC chips to do most of the difficult computational work.

== Principle of TLS acceleration operation ==
The most computationally expensive part of a TLS session is the TLS handshake, where the TLS server (usually a webserver) and the TLS client (usually a web browser) agree on a number of parameters that establish the security of the connection. During the TLS handshake the server and the client establish session keys (symmetric keys, used for the duration of a given session), but the encryption and signature of the TLS handshake messages itself is done using asymmetric keys, which requires more computational power than the symmetric cryptography used for the encryption/decryption of the session data.

Typically a hardware TLS accelerator will offload processing of the TLS handshake while leaving it to the server software to process the less intense symmetric cryptography of the actual TLS data exchange, but some accelerators handle all TLS operations and terminate the TLS connection, thus leaving the server seeing only decrypted connections. Sometimes data centers employ dedicated servers for TLS acceleration in a reverse proxy configuration.

=== Central processor support ===
Modern x86 CPUs support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encoding and decoding in hardware, using the AES instruction set proposed by Intel in March 2008.

Allwinner Technology provides a hardware cryptographic accelerator in its A10, A20, A30 and A80 ARM system-on-chip series, and all ARM CPUs have acceleration in the later ARMv8 architecture. The accelerator provides the RSA public-key algorithm, several widely used symmetric-key algorithms, cryptographic hash functions, and a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.

<doc id="1277350" wikidata="Q42962347" url="?curid=1277350" title="Names of the days of the week">
<text>In many languages, the names given to the seven days of the week are derived from the names of the classical planets in Hellenistic astronomy, which were in turn named after contemporary deities, a system introduced by the Sumerians and later adopted by the Babylonians from whom the Roman Empire adopted the system during late antiquity. In some other languages, the days are named after corresponding deities of the regional culture, beginning either with Sunday or with Monday. The seven-day week was adopted in early Christianity from the Hebrew calendar, and gradually replaced the Roman internundinum.

Sunday remained the first day of the week, being considered the day of the sun god Sol Invictus and the Lord&#x27;s Day, while the Jewish Sabbath remained the seventh.
The Babylonians invented the actual seven-day week in 600 BCE, with Emperor Constantine making the Day of the Sun (, &quot;Sunday&quot;) a legal holiday centuries later.

In the international standard ISO 8601, Monday is treated as the first day of the week, but in many countries it is counted as the second day of the week.

== Days named after planets ==

=== Greco-Roman tradition ===

Between the first and third centuries CE, the Roman Empire gradually replaced the eight-day Roman nundinal cycle with the seven-day week. The earliest evidence for this new system is a Pompeiian graffito referring to 6 February (&quot;ante diem viii idus Februarias&quot;) of the year 60 CE as &quot;dies solis&quot; (&quot;Sunday&quot;). Another early witness is a reference to a lost treatise by Plutarch, written in about 100 CE, which addressed the question of: &quot;Why are the days named after the planets reckoned in a different order from the &#x27;actual&#x27; order?&quot; The treatise is lost, but the answer to the question is known; see planetary hours.

The Ptolemaic system of planetary spheres asserts that the order of the heavenly bodies from the farthest to the closest to the Earth is Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon; objectively, the planets are ordered from slowest to fastest moving as they appear in the night sky.

The days were named after the classical planets of Hellenistic astrology, in the order: Sun (&quot;Helios&quot;), Moon (&quot;Selene&quot;), Mars (&quot;Ares&quot;), Mercury (&quot;Hermes&quot;), Jupiter (&quot;Zeus&quot;), Venus (&quot;Aphrodite&quot;), and Saturn (&quot;Cronus&quot;).

The seven-day week spread throughout the Roman Empire in late antiquity.
By the fourth century CE, it was in wide use throughout the Empire. 

The Greek and Latin names are as follows:

==== Romance languages ====
Except for in Portuguese and Mirandese, the Romance languages preserved the Latin names, except for the names of Sunday, which was replaced by &quot;[dies] Dominicus (Dominica)&quot;, that is, &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Day&quot;, and of Saturday, which was named for the Jewish Sabbath. Mirandese and Portuguese use numbered weekdays, but retain &quot;sábado&quot; and &quot;demingo&quot;/&quot;domingo&quot; for weekends. Meanwhile, Galician occasionally uses them alongside the traditional Latin-derived names, albeit to a lesser extent (see below).

==== Celtic languages ====
Early Old Irish adopted the names from Latin, but introduced separate terms of Norse origin for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, then later supplanted these with terms relating to church fasting practices.
==== Albanian language ====
Albanian adopted the Latin terms for Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday, translated the Latin terms for Sunday and Monday using the native names of Diell and Hënë, respectively, and replaced the Latin terms for Thursday and Friday with the equivalent native deity names Enji and Prende, respectively.

==== Adoptions from Romance ====
Other languages adopted the week together with the Latin (Romance) names for the days of the week in the colonial period. Several constructed languages also adopted the Latin terminology.

With the exception of &quot;sabato&quot;, the Esperanto names are all from French, cf. French &quot;dimanche, lundi, mardi, mercredi, jeudi, vendredi&quot;.

=== Germanic tradition ===

The Germanic peoples adapted the system introduced by the Romans by substituting the Germanic deities for the Roman ones (with the exception of &quot;Saturday&quot;) in a process known as .
The date of the introduction of this system is not known exactly, but it must have happened later than 100 AD but before the introduction of Christianity during the 6th to 7th centuries, i.e., during the final phase or soon after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. This period is later than the Common Germanic stage, but still during the phase of undifferentiated West Germanic. The names of the days of the week in North Germanic languages were not calqued from Latin directly, but taken from the West Germanic names.
* Sunday: Old English (), meaning &quot;sun&#x27;s day&quot;. This is a translation of the Latin phrase . English, like most of the Germanic languages, preserves the day&#x27;s association with the sun. Many other European languages, including all of the Romance languages, have changed its name to the equivalent of &quot;the Lord&#x27;s day&quot; (based on Ecclesiastical Latin ). In both West Germanic and North Germanic mythology, the Sun is personified as Sunna/Sól.
* Monday: Old English (), meaning &quot;Moon&#x27;s day&quot;. This is equivalent to the Latin name . In North Germanic mythology, the Moon is personified as Máni.
* Tuesday: Old English (), meaning &quot;Tiw&#x27;s day&quot;. Tiw (Norse ) was a one-handed god associated with single combat and pledges in Norse mythology and also attested prominently in wider Germanic paganism. The name of the day is also related to the Latin name , &quot;Day of Mars&quot; (the Roman god of war).
* Wednesday: Old English () meaning the day of the Germanic god Woden (known as Óðinn among the North Germanic peoples), and a prominent god of the Anglo-Saxons (and other Germanic peoples) in England until about the seventh century. This corresponds to the Latin counterpart , &quot;Day of Mercury&quot;, as both are deities of magic and knowledge. The German &quot;Mittwoch&quot;, the Low German , the &quot;miðviku-&quot; in Icelandic and the Finnish all mean &quot;mid-week&quot;.
* Thursday: Old English (), meaning &quot;s day&#x27;. means thunder or its personification, the Norse god known in Modern English as Thor. Similarly Dutch , German (&#x27;thunder&#x27;s day&#x27;), Finnish , and Scandinavian (&#x27;Thor&#x27;s day&#x27;). &quot;Thor&#x27;s day&quot; corresponds to Latin , &quot;day of Jupiter&quot; (the Roman god of thunder).
* Friday: Old English (), meaning the day of the Anglo-Saxon goddess . The Norse name for the planet Venus was , &#x27;Frigg&#x27;s star&#x27;. It is based on the Latin , &quot;Day of Venus&quot;.
* Saturday: named after the Roman god Saturn associated with the Titan Cronus, father of Zeus and many Olympians. Its original Anglo-Saxon rendering was (). In Latin, it was , &quot;Day of Saturn&quot;. The Nordic &quot;laugardagur&quot;, &quot;leygardagur&quot;, &quot;laurdag&quot;, etc. deviate significantly as they have no reference to either the Norse or the Roman pantheon; they derive from Old Nordic , literally &quot;washing-day&quot;. The German (mainly used in northern and eastern Germany) and the Low German mean &quot;Sunday Eve&quot;; the German word derives from the name for Shabbat.

==== Adoptions from Germanic ====

=== Hindu tradition ===

Hindu astrology uses the concept of days under the regency of a planet under the term &quot;vāsara/vāra&quot;, the days of the week being called sūrya-/ravi&quot;-&quot;/āditya&quot;, chandra-/soma-, maṅgala-, budha-, guru-/bṛhaspati-, śukra-,&quot; and &quot;śani-vāsara&quot;. &quot;śukrá&quot; is a name of Venus (regarded as a son of Bhṛgu); &quot;guru&quot; is here a title of Bṛhaspati, and hence of Jupiter; &quot;budha&quot; &quot;Mercury&quot; is regarded as a son of &quot;Soma&quot;, that is, the Moon. Knowledge of Greek astrology existed since about the 2nd century BC, but references to the &quot;vāsara&quot; occur somewhat later, during the Gupta period (&quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;, c. 3rd to 5th century AD), that is, at roughly the same period or before the system was introduced in the Roman Empire.

==== In languages of the Indian subcontinent ====
==== Southeast Asian languages ====
The Southeast Asian tradition also uses the Hindu names of the days of the week. Hindu astrology adopted the concept of days under the regency of a planet under the term &quot;vāra&quot;, the days of the week being called &quot;āditya-, soma-, maṅgala-, budha-, guru-, śukra-,&quot; and &quot;śani-vāra&quot;. &quot;śukrá&quot; is a name of Venus (regarded as a son of Bhṛgu); &quot;guru&quot; is here a title of Bṛhaspati, and hence of Jupiter; &quot;budha&quot; &quot;Mercury&quot; is regarded as a son of &quot;Soma&quot;, that is, the Moon.

==== Northeast Asian languages ====

=== East Asian tradition ===
The East Asian naming system for the days of the week closely parallels that of the Latin system and is ordered after the &quot;Seven Luminaries&quot; (七曜 &quot;qī yào&quot;), which consists of the Sun, Moon and the five planets visible to the naked eye.

The Chinese had apparently adopted the seven-day week from the Hellenistic system by the 4th century AD, although by which route is not entirely clear. It was again transmitted to China in the 8th century AD by Manichaeans, via the country of Kang (a Central Asian polity near Samarkand).
The 4th-century AD date, according to the &quot;Cihai&quot; encyclopedia, is due to a reference to Fan Ning (范寧), an astrologer of the Jin dynasty. The renewed adoption from Manichaeans in the 8th century AD (Tang dynasty) is documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing and the Ceylonese Buddhist monk Bu Kong.

The Chinese transliteration of the planetary system was soon brought to Japan by the Japanese monk Kobo Daishi; surviving diaries of the Japanese statesman Fujiwara no Michinaga show the seven-day system in use in Heian Period Japan as early as 1007. In Japan, the seven-day system was kept in use (for astrological purposes) until its promotion to a full-fledged (Western-style) calendrical basis during the Meiji era. In China, with the founding of the Republic of China in 1911, Monday through Saturday in China are now named after the luminaries implicitly with the numbers.


:&quot;Pronunciations for Classical Chinese names are given in Standard Chinese.&quot;

== Numbered days of the week ==
=== Days numbered from Monday ===
ISO prescribes Monday as the first day of the week with ISO-8601 for software date formats.

The Slavic, Baltic and Uralic languages (except Finnish and partially Estonian and Võro) adopted numbering but took Monday rather than Sunday as the &quot;first day&quot;. This convention is also found in some Austronesian languages whose speakers were converted to Christianity by European missionaries.

In Slavic languages, some of the names correspond to numerals after Sunday: compare Russian &quot;vtornik&quot; () &quot;Tuesday&quot; and &quot;vtoroj&quot; () &quot;the second&quot;, &quot;chetverg&quot; () &quot;Thursday&quot; and &quot;chetvjortyj&quot; () &quot;the fourth&quot;, &quot;pyatnitsa&quot; () &quot;Friday&quot; and &quot;pyatyj&quot; () &quot;the fifth&quot;; see also the Notes.

In Standard Chinese, the week is referred to as the &quot;Stellar Period&quot; () or &quot;Cycle&quot; ().

The modern Chinese names for the days of the week are based on a simple numerical sequence. The word for &quot;week&quot; is followed by a number indicating the day: &quot;Monday&quot; is literally the &quot;Stellar Period One&quot;/&quot;Cycle One&quot;, that is, the &quot;First day of the Stellar Period/Cycle&quot;, etc. The exception is Sunday, where 日 (&quot;rì&quot;), &quot;day&quot; or &quot;Sun&quot;, is used instead of a number. A slightly informal and colloquial variant to 日 is 天 (&quot;tiān&quot;) &quot;day&quot;, &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven&quot;. However, the term 週天 is rarely used compared to 星期天.

Accordingly, the notational abbreviation of the days of the week uses the numbers, for example, 一 for &quot;M&quot; or &quot;Mon(.)&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;. The abbreviation of Sunday uses exclusively 日 and not 天. Attempted usage of 天 as such will not be understood.

Colloquially, the week is also known as the &quot;Worship&quot; (), with the names of the days of the week formed accordingly. This is also dominant in certain regional varieties of Chinese.

The following is a table of the Mandarin names of the days of the weeks. Note that standard Taiwan Mandarin pronounces 期 as &quot;qí&quot;, so 星期 is instead &quot;xīngqí&quot;. While all varieties of Mandarin may pronounce 星期 as &quot;xīngqi&quot; and 禮拜/礼拜 as &quot;lǐbai&quot;, the second syllable with the neutral tone, this is not reflected in the table either for legibility.
Several Sinitic languages refer to Saturday as 週末 &quot;end of the week&quot; and Sunday as 禮拜. Examples include Shenyang Mandarin, Hanyuan Sichuanese Mandarin, Taishanese, Yudu Hakka, Teochew, Ningbonese, and Loudi Old Xiang. Some Hakka varieties in Taiwan still use the traditional Luminaries.

=== Days numbered from Sunday ===
Sunday comes first in order in calendars shown in the table below. In the Abrahamic tradition, the first day of the week is Sunday. Biblical Sabbath (corresponding to Saturday) is when God rested from six-day Creation, making the day following the Sabbath the first day of the week (corresponding to Sunday). Seventh-day Sabbaths were sanctified for celebration and rest. After the week was adopted in early Christianity, Sunday remained the first day of the week, but also gradually displaced Saturday as the day of celebration and rest, being considered the Lord&#x27;s Day.

Saint Martin of Dumio (c. 520–580), archbishop of Braga, decided not to call days by pagan gods and to use ecclesiastic terminology to designate them. While the custom of numbering the days of the week was mostly prevalent in the Eastern Church, Portuguese and Mirandese, due to Martin&#x27;s influence, are the only Romance languages in which the names of the days come from numbers rather than planetary names.

Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) historically objected to the pagan etymologies of days and months and substituted numbering, beginning with First Day for Sunday.

Icelandic is a special case within the Germanic languages, maintaining only the Sun and Moon (&quot;sunnudagur&quot; and &quot;mánudagur&quot; respectively), while dispensing with the names of the explicitly heathen gods in favour of a combination of numbered days and days whose names are linked to pious or domestic routine (&quot;föstudagur&quot;, &quot;Fasting Day&quot; and &quot;laugardagur&quot;, &quot;Washing Day&quot;). The &quot;washing day&quot; is also used in other North Germanic languages, but otherwise the names correspond to those of English.

=== Days numbered from Saturday ===
In Swahili, the day begins at sunrise, unlike in the Arabic and Hebrew calendars where the day starts at sunset (therefore an offset of twelve hours on average), and unlike in the Western world where the day starts at midnight (therefore an offset of six hours on average). Saturday is therefore the first day of the week, as it is the day that includes the first night of the week in Arabic.

Etymologically speaking, Swahili has two &quot;fifth&quot; days. The words for Saturday through Wednesday contain the Bantu-derived Swahili words for &quot;one&quot; through &quot;five&quot;. The word for Thursday, &quot;Alhamisi&quot;, is of Arabic origin and means &quot;the fifth&quot; (day). The word for Friday, &quot;Ijumaa&quot;, is also Arabic and means (day of) &quot;gathering&quot; for the Friday noon prayers in Islam.

== Mixing of numbering and astronomy ==

In the Žejane dialect of Istro-Romanian, &quot;lur&quot; (Monday) and &quot;virer&quot; (Friday) follow the Latin convention, while &quot;utorek&quot; (Tuesday), &quot;sredu&quot; (Wednesday), and &quot;četrtok&quot; (Thursday) follow the Slavic convention.

There are several systems in the different Basque dialects.

In Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino), which is mainly based on a medieval version of Spanish, the five days of Monday–Friday closely follow the Spanish names. For Sunday is used the Arabic name, which is based on numbering (meaning &quot;Day one&quot; or &quot;First day&quot;), because a Jewish language was not likely to adapt a name based on &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day&quot; for Sunday. As in Spanish, the Ladino name for Saturday is based on &quot;Sabbath&quot;. However, as a Jewish language—and with Saturday being the actual day of rest in the Jewish community—Ladino directly adapted the Hebrew name, &quot;Shabbat&quot;.

The days of the week in Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language) originated from the Sanamahi creation myth of Meitei mythology.

<text>SeaFire, first published in 1994, was the fourteenth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including Gardner&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

==Plot summary==
With the help of his latest girlfriend Flicka von Grüsse, James goes after billionaire Sir Maxwell Tarn, who thinks he&#x27;s the next Hitler. Captain Bond now works for MicroGlobe One rather than an ill M whom he visits to cheer up and keep informed of the plot. The global trail takes 007 to Puerto Rico via Spain, Israel and Germany.

During the story, Bond proposes to Flicka. An old friend reappears to aid James and split up this spy twosome.

<text>In mathematics, a branched surface is a generalization of both surfaces and train tracks.

==Definition==
A surface is a space that locally looks like formula_1 (a Euclidean space, up to homeomorphism). 

Consider, however, the space obtained by taking the quotient of two copies A,B of formula_1 under the identification of a closed half-space of each with a closed half-space of the other. This will be a surface except along a single line. Now, pick another copy C of formula_3 and glue it and A together along halfspaces so that the singular line of this gluing is transverse in A to the previous singular line.

Call this complicated space K. A branched surface is a space that is locally modeled on K.

==Weight==
A branched manifold can have a weight assigned to various of its subspaces; if this is done, the space is often called a weighted branched manifold. Weights are non-negative real numbers and are assigned to subspaces &quot;N&quot; that satisfy the following:
*&quot;N&quot; is open.
*&quot;N&quot; does not include any points whose only neighborhoods are the quotient space described above.
*&quot;N&quot; is maximal with respect to the above two conditions.

That is, &quot;N&quot; is a component of the branched surface minus its branching set. Weights are assigned so that if a component branches into two other components, then the sum of the weights of the two unidentified halfplanes of that neighborhood is the weight of the identified halfplane.

<text>In mathematics, a branched manifold is a generalization of a differentiable manifold which may have singularities of very restricted type and admits a well-defined tangent space at each point. A branched &quot;n&quot;-manifold is covered by &quot;n&quot;-dimensional &quot;coordinate charts&quot;, each of which involves one or several &quot;branches&quot; homeomorphically projecting into the same differentiable &quot;n&quot;-disk in R&quot;n&quot;. Branched manifolds first appeared in the dynamical systems theory, in connection with one-dimensional hyperbolic attractors constructed by Smale and were formalized by R. F. Williams in a series of papers on expanding attractors. Special cases of low dimensions are known as train tracks (&quot;n&quot; = 1) and branched surfaces (&quot;n&quot; = 2) and play prominent role in the geometry of three-manifolds after Thurston.

== Definition ==

Let &quot;K&quot; be a metrizable space, together with:

# a collection {&quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;} of closed subsets of &quot;K&quot;; 
# for each &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;, a finite collection {&quot;D&quot;&quot;ij&quot;} of closed subsets of &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;;
# for each &quot;i&quot;, a map &quot;π&quot;&quot;i&quot;: &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; → &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot; to a closed &quot;n&quot;-disk of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; in R&quot;n&quot;.

These data must satisfy the following requirements:

# ∪&quot;j&quot; &quot;D&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; and ∪&quot;i&quot; Int &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;K&quot;; 
# the restriction of &quot;π&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;D&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is a homeomorphism onto its image &quot;π&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;D&quot;&quot;ij&quot;) which is a closed class &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;n&quot;-disk relative to the boundary of &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;;
# there is a cocycle of diffeomorphisms {&quot;α&quot;&quot;lm&quot;} of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; (&quot;k&quot; ≥ 1) such that &quot;π&quot;&quot;l&quot; = &quot;α&quot;&quot;lm&quot; · &quot;π&quot;&quot;m&quot; when defined. The domain of &quot;α&quot;&quot;lm&quot; is &quot;π&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;U&quot;&quot;l&quot; ∩ &quot;U&quot;&quot;m&quot;).

Then the space &quot;K&quot; is a branched &quot;n&quot;-manifold of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

The standard machinery of differential topology can be adapted to the case of branched manifolds. This leads to the definition of the tangent space &quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;K&quot; to a branched &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;K&quot; at a given point &quot;p&quot;, which is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real vector space; a natural notion of a &quot;C&quot;&quot;k&quot; differentiable map &quot;f&quot;: &quot;K&quot; → &quot;L&quot; between branched manifolds, its differential &quot;df&quot;: &quot;T&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;K&quot; → &quot;T&quot;&quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)&quot;L&quot;, the germ of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;p&quot;, jet spaces, and other related notions.
== Examples ==

Extrinsically, branched &quot;n&quot;-manifolds are &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complexes embedded into some Euclidean space such that each point has a well-defined &quot;n&quot;-dimensional tangent space.

* A finite graph whose edges are smoothly embedded arcs in a surface, such that all edges incident to a given vertex &quot;v&quot; have the same tangent line at &quot;v&quot;, is a branched one-manifold, or train track (there are several variants of the notion of a train track — here no restriction is placed on the valencies of the vertices). As a specific example, consider the &quot;figure eight&quot; formed by two externally tangent circles in the plane.
* A two-complex in R3 consisting of several leaves that may tangentially come together in pairs along certain double curves, or come together in triples at isolated singular points where these double curves intersect transversally, is a branched two-manifold, or branched surface. For example, consider the space &quot;K&quot; obtained from 3 copies of the Euclidean plane, labelled &quot;T&quot; (top), &quot;M&quot; (middle) and &quot;B&quot; (bottom) by identifying the half-planes &quot;y&quot; ≤ 0 in &quot;T&quot; and &quot;M&quot; and the half-planes &quot;x&quot; ≤ 0 in &quot;M&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. One can imagine &quot;M&quot; being the flat coordinate plane &quot;z=0&quot; in R3, &quot;T&quot; a leaf curling upward from &quot;M&quot; along the &quot;x&quot;-axis to the right (positive &quot;y&quot;-direction) and &quot;B&quot; another leaf curling downward from &quot;M&quot; along the &quot;y&quot;-axis in front (positive &quot;x&quot;-direction). The coordinate axes in the &quot;M&quot; plane are the double curves of &quot;K&quot;, which intersect transversally at a unique triple point (0,0).

<text>Islam constitutes the third largest religion in Singapore, with Muslims accounting for approximately 15.6% of the population, as indicated by the 2020 census. Predominantly, Singaporean Muslims are Sunni Muslims adhering to either the Shafi‘i or Hanafi schools of thought. The majority of the Muslim population, about 80%, are ethnic Malays, while 13% are of Indian descent. The remaining fraction comprises local Chinese, Eurasian, and Arab communities, in addition to foreign migrants. Buddhism and Christianity are the two larger religious affiliations in the country.

Since the introduction of Islam in the region in the 14th century, Islamic bureaucracy formed an integral part of the administrative systems of the Malay Sultanates. In the 1500s, the Sultanate of Melaka was recorded to have applied Sharia law, a practice which was continued by the Johore Sultanate, of which Singapore was a part until 1824.

In 1915, the British colonial authorities established the Mohammedan Advisory Board. The Board was tasked with advising the colonial authorities on matters connected with the Islamic religion and custom.

Singapore became part of Malaysia in 1963 and was then expelled in 1965. The Constitution of Singapore included two provisions relating to the special position of the Malays and their religious rights, Article 152 and Article 153.

Article 152 states:
(1) It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore.

(2) The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.
Because of Article 152, Section 2, the Singapore government bans missionaries from proselytising the Malay population away from Islam towards other religions. This ban is meant to avoid engendering racial and religious tensions with the Muslim population. These tensions would arise because Malayness is closely and strongly identified with Islam.

Article 153 states:
The Legislature shall by law make provision for regulating Muslim religious affairs and for constituting a Council to advise the President in matters relating to the Muslim religion.
In 1966, the Singaporean Parliament passed the Administration of Muslim Law Act. Coming into effect in 1968, the Act defined the powers and jurisdiction of three key Muslim institutions:

# the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore
# the Sharia Court
# the Registry of Muslim Marriages

These institutions are under the purview of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS). The minister responsible for these institutions, however, is the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.

==Key Muslim institutions==
===Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura===

The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), also known as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, looks after and takes care of the administration and interests of Singapore&#x27;s Muslim community.

The Majlis is headed by a Council, which comprises the President of MUIS, the Mufti of Singapore and other persons recommended by the Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs. The council is appointed by the President of Singapore.

Since 2009, the council has been headquartered in the Singapore Islamic Hub, located along Braddell Road.

===Shariah Court===

In 1880, the British colonial authorities introduced the Mahomedan Marriage Ordinance which officially recognised the status of Muslim personal law in Singapore.

In 1958, pursuant to the 1957 Muslim Ordinance, a Syariah Court with jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes pertaining to Muslim marriages and divorce cases was established.

The Court replaced a set of government-licensed but otherwise unsupervised Kadi (Muslim judges) who had previously decided on questions of divorce and inheritance, following either the traditions of particular ethnic groups or their own interpretations of Muslim law.

Today, the Syariah Court continues to exist as a court of competent jurisdiction with power and jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes defined by AMLA.

===Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM)===

The Registry of Muslim Marriages is a government agency that registers marriages between couples that consist of two Muslims. Mixed-religion marriages are registered at the Registry of Marriages.

Previously, the registration of Muslim marriages as well as divorces were conducted under one unit, which is the Syariah Court.

It was first located in a bungalow at Fort Canning and later moved to Canning Rise in 1983.

Appeals on decisions of the Syariah Court and the ROMM are heard and determined by the Appeal Board.

Unlike MUIS, the Syariah Court and ROMM are not statutory boards but constitute a part of the Ministry of Social and Family Development).

==Muslim organisations==

===Ahmadiyya===

The Ahmadiyya community was established during the era of the Second Caliphate, shortly before the Second World War. Ghulam Ahsan Ayyaz was the first missionary to the country, who under the directive of the caliph arrived in 1935, in a period when the territory was part of the Straits Settlements. In the 1970s, the community had roughly 200 followers.

===Association of Muslim Professionals===

The Association of Muslim Professionals is a community self-help group established on 10 October 1991, to improve the socio-economic performance of Singapore&#x27;s Malay-Muslim community.

===Malay-Muslim organisations===

Apart from these key Muslim institutions, there are also community self-help groups, voluntary welfare organisations and civic groups like the Young Women Muslim Association of Singapore (YWMA), Association of Muslim Professionals, Yayasan Mendaki, Muslim Missionary Society (Jamiyah), PERDAUS, Singapore Islamic Scholars and Islamic Teachers Association (PERGAS), Muhammadiyah and Islamic Theological Association of Singapore (Pertapis).

===Indian-Muslim organisations===

There are also many Indian-Muslim organisations in Singapore e.g. Federation of Indian Muslims, Singapore Kadayanallur Muslim League, Koothanallur Association, Singapore Tenkasi Muslim Welfare Society, Thiruvithancode Muslim Union, and United Indian Muslim Association.

===Religio-cultural groups===

There are various religio-cultural groups in Singapore, such as Al Usrah Al Dandaraweyah, which is organized in the structure of a family, fostering close relationships among its members. Other notable groups include the Tariqah group at-Tariqah al-Ahmadiah al-Idrisiah ar-Rasyidiah and Naqshbandi Haqqani Singapore, both of which contribute to the spiritual growth and religious education of their members.

One of the earliest established religio-cultural groups, encompassing different Sufi orders like Qadriah, Chistia, Naqshabandiyah, Sanusiyyah, and Suharwadiyah, is now known as Khanqah Khairiyyah. Founded in 1971, the group has maintained its presence at the same location on Siglap Road in Singapore ever since.

===Shia organisations===

The Shia community consists of Twelver Shi&#x27;ites, Ismailis and Dawoodi Bohras.

In Singapore, the history of the Twelver Shi&#x27;ites began with the immigration of the Khoja community from India. A member of Khoja community spearheaded the founding of the Jaafari Muslim Association.

In the 1980s, Malay members of the Muslim Youth Assembly (Himpunan Belia Islam) became part of the Shi&#x27;a community in Singapore. Subsequently, a center called Hussainiyah Azzahra was established to cater to their religious needs and activities. This development further diversified the religious landscape of Singaporean Muslims.

Both the Jaafari Muslim Association and the Muslim Youth Assembly cater to the Twelver Shi&#x27;ites.

The Dawoodi Bohras, a subsect of Shia Islam, are led by their spiritual leader, the Da&#x27;ie Almutlaq, who represents the twenty-first imam, Mohammed Burhanuddin. In Singapore, the Dawoodi Bohra community is served by the Anjuman-E-Burhani. Bohra traders began settling in Singapore in the 1820s. The Burhani Mosque, established in 1829, serves as the mosque for the Bohra community in Singapore.

The Ismailis are followers of Aga Khan. The Aga Khan has decided to establish an Ismaili Centre and regional representative office of the Aga Khan Development Network in Singapore.

===Hanafi Muslim Community===
There is also a significant proportion of Sunni Hanafi Muslims in Singapore. Generally, most Pakistanis, Indian, and Myanmar (Burmese) Muslims in Singapore follow Hanafi school&#x27;s traditions. While they often inter-mix with the Malays who follow the Shafi&#x27;i madhab, Indian mosques in Singapore, such as Masjid Angullia, Masjid Abdul Gaffoor, Masjid Bencoolen, and Masjid Moulana Mohamed Ali, cater to the needs of the Hanafi Muslim community in Singapore.

== Da&#x27;wah Organisations ==
In Singapore, the Islamic Da&#x27;wah (invitation/conversion) movement has a significant influence. Numerous local and international organizations, such as Hikmah Times, contribute to this impact.

The Muslim Converts&#x27; Association of Singapore, also known as Darul Arqam, offers support and resources for individuals who have converted to Islam.

==Mosques==

There are 72 mosques in Singapore. With the exception of Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim (which is administered by the State of Johor), all the mosques in Singapore are administered by MUIS. Twenty-three mosques were built using the Masjid Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF). Masjid Al-Mawaddah, the twenty-third MBMF mosque, was officially opened in May 2009. The speakers for broadcasting the Islamic call to prayer was turned inwards to broadcast towards the interior of the mosques as part of a noise abatement campaign in 1974.

==Madrasahs==

In Singapore, madrasahs are private schools which are overseen by MUIS. There are six full-time madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and junior college equivalent, or &quot;Pre-U&quot;, at several schools). Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE &#x27;O&#x27; Levels like their peers. 

In 2009, MUIS introduced the &quot;Joint Madrasah System&quot; (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the &quot;ukhrawi&quot;, or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah by 2019. 

Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudung for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the &quot;madrasah&quot; instead of enrolling full-time.

<doc id="1277394" wikidata="Q5146236" url="?curid=1277394" title="Colleen Browning">
<text>Colleen Browning (May 16, 1918 – August 22, 2003) was an Anglo-American realist and magical realist painter.

==Early life==
Colleen Browning was born 16 May 1918 in Shoeburyness, Essex, England at the mouth of the River Thames. As a child, Browning was a gifted artist. Her parents supported and encouraged her by enrolling her in the Farnham School of Arts in 1933. In 1934 she exhibited at the Women in Arts Society in London. In 1935 she attended the Salisbury School of Arts and Craft. In that year she also exhibited her drawings and paintings at the Whitechapel Gallery.

Browning attended London&#x27;s Slade School of Art on a full scholarship from 1937 to 1939. In 1942, she worked as a mapmaker for the Royal Air Force during World War II. Browning later worked as a set designer in London for the Two Cities Film Studios, which was later to become the J. Arthur Rank Film Corporation. In 1948 Browning met the English writer Geoffrey Wagner while on vacation on the island of Ischia. They quickly decided to marry in America, where Wagner had been hired to teach at the University of Rochester. Toward the latter part of the 1940s she experimented with fantasy compositions inspired by Salvador Dali and other Surrealist leaders. She made the transition from theatrical work to easel painter toward the end of the 1940s

==Career==
In 1949 she emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City. There, she and Mr. Wagner lived on 116th Street and Second Avenue. It was there that she painted “Holiday,” looking down from her fourth-floor window, and “East Harlem Street Scene,” depicting the bustle of her neighborhood. In “Fire Escape II,” she arranged four children on the vertical structure of a fire escape Browning became an American citizen a year later. The artist lived in New York City for the next five decades. Browning was a major figure in the realism (arts) movement in New York City during a time when Abstract Realism and the art of Jackson Pollock was beginning to rise to prominence. In particular, Browning often painted New York City and scenes of urban life. For instance her painting &quot;Holiday&quot; (1951-2) depicts a street scene that Browning captured while living on 116th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan. In 1952 she exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1953 she held a solo exhibition at the Edwin Hewitt Gallery in New York City.

In her later career, Browning created works in the style of magic realism that increasingly blurred the lines between the real and the imagined. In works such as &quot;Picture of a Painting of the Great Circus Parade&quot; (1988) and Black Umbrella (1970) the artist captures a real event but with a focus on the wonderful and a blurred sense of reality. A leader in the Modern and Post-Modern revivals of Realism in American art, Browning is a realist whose work defies attempts to categorize it. Her work is largely recognized for its superior command of materials and media and for her unwavering devotion to understanding the human condition.

Browning also taught art. She was a professor at Pratt Institute and the City College of New York. In 1977, she created a series set in the city’s graffiti-adorned subway cars. In each, dreamy and highly nuanced faces peer out of windows framed by the bold slashes of spray-painted designs. Then in the 1980s, she turned to the occult, painting clairvoyants and astrologers. In addition she taught at the National Academy of Design from 1978 to 1982.Her work was included in the National Academy of Design&#x27;s yearly exhibitions, and she has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Kennedy Galleries in New York. Like many professional artists, Browning supplemented her income through commercial illustration and printmaking. This phase of her career is highlighted in SAMA-Johnstown&#x27;s exhibition.

Browning died in New York City on August 22, 2003. According to her wishes, a substantial collection of her paintings was bequeathed to the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art. The years since Ms. Browning’s death in 2003, at 85, have led to a reconsideration of her impact throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Her work, with an endowment to support its exhibition, was bequeathed by her husband’s estate to the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art, which organized this traveling retrospective in conjunction with Philip Eliasoph, a professor of art history at Fairfield University and the author of “Colleen Browning: The Enchantment of Realism.”

==Recognition==
Browning was a National Academician. She served on the Academy Council from 1969 to 1972.

Her work has been exhibited at the Whitney Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Walker Art Gallery, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. During her lifetime, Browning&#x27;s work was also reproduced in numerous publications, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;American Artist&quot;.

In 2013 a retrospective of the artist&#x27;s work was organized at Fairfield University through &quot;Colleen Browning: The Early Works&quot; at the Bellarmine Gallery and &quot;Colleen Browning: A Brush with Magic&quot; at the Thomas J. Walsh Jr. Art Gallery. A Brush with Magic had already appeared in Ireland and New York City with dates in Connecticut, Ohio and Texas still to come. Her work has also been featured in articles in Time, Newsweek, Glamour, the New York Times, Arts Magazine, Art International, and American Artist.

Browning&#x27;s distinctive brand of figurative painting, with subjects ranging from eerie worshipers in a Guatemalan church to graffiti- covered Harlem subway cars to the surrealist still life Fruits and Friends (1978, Harmon-Meek Galleries, Naples, Fl.), displays definite affinities with both the SOCIAL REALISM of Jack Levine and the MAGIC REALISM of Philip Evergood and George Tooker. Nevertheless, Browning developed and maintains a wry, multi-hued personal stamp to her painting which for almost four decades has set it apart from prevailing fashion.

<doc id="1277396" wikidata="Q7832909" url="?curid=1277396" title="Train track (mathematics)">
<text>In the mathematical area of topology, a train track is a family of curves embedded on a surface, meeting the following conditions:
#The curves meet at a finite set of vertices called &quot;switches&quot;.
#Away from the switches, the curves are smooth and do not touch each other.
#At each switch, three curves meet with the same tangent line, with two curves entering from one direction and one from the other.

The main application of train tracks in mathematics is to study laminations of surfaces, that is, partitions of closed subsets of surfaces into unions of smooth curves. Train tracks have also been used in graph drawing.

== Train tracks and laminations ==
A lamination of a surface is a partition of a closed subset of the surface into smooth curves. The study of train tracks was originally motivated by the following observation: If a generic lamination on a surface is looked at from a distance by a myopic person, it will look like a train track.

A switch in a train track models a point where two families of parallel curves in the lamination merge to become a single family, as shown in the illustration. Although the switch consists of three curves ending in and intersecting at a single point, the curves in the lamination do not have endpoints and do not intersect each other.

For this application of train tracks to laminations, it is often important to constrain the shapes that can be formed by connected components of the surface between the curves of the track. For instance, Penner and Harer require that each such component, when glued to a copy of itself along its boundary to form a smooth surface with cusps, have negative cusped Euler characteristic.

A train track with weights, or weighted train track or measured train track, consists of a train track with a non-negative real number, called a &quot;weight&quot;, assigned to each branch. The weights can be used to model which of the curves in a parallel family of curves from a lamination are split to which sides of the switch. Weights must satisfy the following switch condition: The weight assigned to the ingoing branch at a switch should equal the sum of the weights assigned to the branches outgoing from that switch.
Weights are closely related to the notion of carrying. A train track is said to carry a lamination if there is a train track neighborhood such that every leaf of the lamination is contained in the neighborhood and intersects each vertical fiber transversely. If each vertical fiber has nontrivial intersection with some leaf, then the lamination is fully carried by the train track.

<text>Operation Linebacker was the codename of a U.S. Seventh Air Force and U.S. Navy Task Force 77 air interdiction campaign conducted against North Vietnam from 9 May to 23 October 1972, during the Vietnam War.

Its purpose was to halt or slow the transportation of supplies and materials for the &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot; (known in the West as the Easter Offensive), an invasion of the South Vietnam by the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) that had been launched on 30 March. &quot;Linebacker&quot; was the first continuous bombing effort conducted against North Vietnam since the end of Operation Rolling Thunder in November 1968.

==Nguyen Hue Offensive==

At midday on 30 March 1972, 30,000 PAVN troops, supported by regiments of tanks and artillery, rolled southward across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separated the two Vietnams. This three-division force caught the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and their American allies unprepared. The PAVN force struck the defensive positions of the ARVN 3rd Division and threw it into disarray. ARVN forces then fell back, and a race began between both belligerents to the bridges at Đông Hà and Cam Lộ.

By 4 April, ARVN officers had patched together a defensive line that held the PAVN at bay, but it was only a temporary respite. Although the conventional attack by the PAVN, which included the extensive use of armor and heavy artillery, riveted the attention of the allies on the northern provinces, it was only the first of three such operations that were launched that spring. On 5 April, a PAVN force of 20,000 crossed the border from their sanctuaries in Cambodia in another three-division, combined arms force to attack Bình Long Province, north of Saigon. They quickly seized the town of Lộc Ninh and then surrounded the town of An Lộc, cutting the road to the capital.

On 12 April, the PAVN struck again, this time moving in from eastern Laos and seizing a series of border outposts around Đắk Tô in Kon Tum Province in the Central Highlands. The PAVN then proceeded east toward the provincial capital of Kon Tum. Hanoi had initiated the offensive to coincide with the winter monsoon, when continuous rain and low cloud cover made air support difficult.

The initial U.S. response to the offensive was lackadaisical and confused. The Pentagon was not unduly alarmed and the U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam and Commander, U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, General Creighton W. Abrams, were both out of the country. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s first response was to consider a three-day attack by Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers on Hanoi and the port city of Haiphong. His National Security Advisor, Dr. Henry Kissinger, convinced Nixon to reconsider, since he did not want to jeopardize the formalization of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) with the Soviet Union, that was due to be signed in May. Another stumbling block to the plan was Abrams&#x27; desire to utilize the available bombers (with their all-weather capability) to support the ARVN defense.

Nixon and Kissinger considered a plan offered by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be both unimaginative and lacking in aggression. On 4 April, Nixon authorized the bombing of North Vietnam (which had been limited to reprisal raids just above the DMZ) up to the 18th parallel. To prevent a total ARVN collapse and to protect American prestige during the upcoming summit meeting with Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev, Nixon decided to risk a massive escalation of force.

Due to the continuous withdrawal of American forces as part of the policy of Vietnamization, at the time of the invasion fewer than 10,000 U.S. combat troops remained in South Vietnam, and most of them were scheduled to leave within the next six months. The number of combat aircraft stationed in Southeast Asia was less than half that of its peak strength in 1968–1969. At the beginning of 1972, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) had only three squadrons of McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers and one squadron of Cessna A-37 Dragonfly light attack aircraft, a total of 76 aircraft, stationed in South Vietnam. Another 114 fighter-bombers were located at bases in Thailand. 83 B-52s were stationed at U-Tapao RTAFB, Thailand and at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The U.S. Navy (USN)&#x27;s Task Force 77 (stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin), had four aircraft carriers assigned to it, but only two were available at any one time to conduct operations. Their air wings had approximately 140 aircraft.

==Build-up and air attacks==
American and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) aircraft had been supporting the defense (weather permitting) since the beginning of the offensive. These strikes were conducted in support of ARVN forces, and included those of the air wings of the carriers and . The bad weather limited the ability of the U.S. aircraft to assist in stemming the North Vietnamese onslaught. By 6 April, at naval and air bases around the globe, American forces were put on alert and ships and aircraft squadrons began moving toward Southeast Asia.

The U.S. began a rapid build-up of airpower. The USAF deployed 176 F-4s and 12 F-105 Thunderchiefs from bases in the Republic of Korea and the U.S. to Thailand between 1 April and 11 May in Operation Constant Guard. Strategic Air Command (SAC) dispatched 124 B-52s from the U.S. to Guam bringing the total B-52 strength available for operations to 209. The USN cut short its port period for the carriers and and ordered , and to augment the fleet so that four or more carrier air wings could conduct missions simultaneously. 7th Fleet assets in local waters were thereby increased from 84 to 138 ships.

USAF tactical strikes against North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel were authorized on 5 April under the nickname &quot;Freedom Train&quot;. The first mass B-52 raid directed against the north was conducted on 10 April when 12 B-52s, supported by 53 attack aircraft, struck petroleum storage facilities around Vinh. By 12 April, Nixon had informed Kissinger that he had decided on a more comprehensive bombing campaign which would include strikes against both Hanoi and Haiphong.
The following day 18 B-52s struck Thanh Hóa&#x27;s Bai Thuong Air Base. Three more days followed before another strike, this time by another 18 bombers in a pre-dawn attack against an oil tank farm outside Haiphong. They were followed by more than 100 tactical aircraft attacking targets around Hanoi and Haiphong during daylight. Between 6 and 15 April, U.S. aircraft also struck and destroyed the Paul Doumer and Thanh Hóa bridges and the Yên Viên railway marshalling yard. This marked the introduction of laser-guided bombs against strategic targets in North Vietnam. Both bridges had previously been attacked unsuccessfully with conventional bombs and even missiles. The B-52s were then withdrawn from operations in the north and when they returned in June, their missions would be limited to South Vietnam.

By mid-month, nearly all of North Vietnam had been cleared for bombing raids for the first time in over three years. Air Force and Navy commanders and pilots were relieved that Nixon (unlike President Johnson) left the operational planning to local commanders and loosened the targeting restrictions that had hampered Operation Rolling Thunder. Between 1 May and 30 June B-52s, fighter-bombers, and gunships had flown 18,000 sorties against formidable anti-aircraft defenses with the loss of 29 aircraft.

The U.S. also now began what North Vietnamese historians have described as &quot;using devious political and diplomatic schemes...to cut back the amount of aid being supplied to us by socialist nations&quot;. On 20 April Kissinger met secretly with Brezhnev in Moscow. Unwilling to jeopardize the normalisation of relations with the West and wary of Washington&#x27;s growing relationship with Beijing, Brezhnev agreed to apply pressure to Hanoi to end the offensive and negotiate seriously.

Brezhnev then arranged for another secret meeting between Kissinger and Hanoi&#x27;s lead negotiator Le Duc Tho, to be held on 2 May in Paris. On the day, the two men met for a session that Kissinger later described as &quot;brutal and insulting.&quot; The North Vietnamese, sensing victory, were in no mood to make concessions. As a result of this meeting and the fall of Quảng Trị City Nixon was prepared to up the ante, stating that &quot;the bastards have never been bombed like they&#x27;re going to be bombed this time&quot;.

==Operation Pocket Money==

On 27 April, ARVN defenses in Quảng Trị Province began to collapse. Due to conflicting orders from their high command, ARVN units joined an exodus of refugees heading southwards, abandoning Quảng Trị city. PAVN forces entered the city on the same day as the meeting between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. The PAVN offensive had become a massive conventional military operation that was being conducted on three fronts simultaneously, involving the equivalent of 15 divisions and 600 tanks. As the North Vietnamese continued to gain ground in three of South Vietnam&#x27;s four military regions, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff updated their contingency plans (drawn up before the bombing halt of 1968) for the resumption of bombing in the north and recommended it to the President, who approved it on 8 May.

Shortly after his inauguration, Nixon had ordered the preparation of a contingency plan, one that would hopefully bring the Vietnam War to an end. Operation Duck Hook was to include an invasion of the North and included a proposal to mine its major harbors. The plan had been shelved at the time as too extreme but it had not been forgotten. The USN had also been updating its own contingency plans for just such a mining operation since 1965. On 5 May, Nixon ordered the Joint Chiefs to prepare to execute the aerial mining portion of the &quot;Duck Hook&quot; plan within three days under the operational title &quot;Pocket Money&quot;.

At precisely 09:00 (local time) on 9 May, six US Navy A-7 Corsair IIs and three A-6 Intruders from the USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot; flew into Haiphong harbor and dropped thirty-six Mark-52 and Mark-55 naval mines into its waters. They were protected from attacks by Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) MiG fighter aircraft by the guided-missile cruisers and , with several destroyers including the guided-missile destroyer launching Operation Custom Tailor and by supporting flights of F-4 Phantoms. The reason for the precise timing of the strike became apparent when Nixon simultaneously delivered a televised speech explaining the escalation to the American people: &quot;The only way to stop the killing is to take the weapons of war out of the hands of the international outlaws of North Vietnam.&quot;. The mines were activated five days after their delivery to allow any vessels then in port to escape without damage. Over the next three days other US carrier-based aircraft laid 11,000 more mines into North Vietnam&#x27;s secondary harbors, blockading all maritime commerce for the country.

Before and during &quot;Pocket Money&quot;, Nixon and Kissinger had worried about the Soviet and Chinese reaction to the escalation. Hours before Nixon&#x27;s speech announcing the mining, Kissinger had delivered a letter to Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin which outlined the U.S. plan, but which also made clear Nixon&#x27;s willingness to proceed with the summit. The next day, Nixon shook the hand of Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev at the White House. Although Moscow and Beijing publicly denounced the American operation, they were not willing to jeopardize their thawing relationship with the U.S. and Hanoi&#x27;s requests for support and aid from its socialist allies met with only cool responses.

==Going north==
Operation Linebacker, the code name for the new interdiction campaign, would have four objectives: to isolate North Vietnam from its sources of supply by destroying railroad bridges and rolling stock in and around Hanoi and north-eastwards toward the Chinese frontier; the targeting of primary storage areas and marshalling yards; to destroy storage and transshipment points and to eliminate (or at least damage) the North&#x27;s air defense system. With nearly 85 percent of North Vietnam&#x27;s imports (which arrived by sea) blocked by &quot;Pocket Money&quot;, the administration and the Pentagon believed that this would cut its final lines of communication with its socialist allies. China alone shipped an average of 22,000 tons of supplies a month over two rail lines and eight major roads that linked it with North Vietnam.
On 10 May Operation Linebacker began with mass bombing operations against North Vietnam by tactical fighter aircraft of the Seventh Air Force and Task Force 77. Their targets included the railroad switching yards at Yên Viên and the Paul Doumer Bridge, on the northern outskirts of Hanoi. A total of 414 sorties were flown on the first day of the operation, 120 by the Air Force and 294 by the Navy and they encountered the heaviest single day of air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War. The U.S claimed 11 VPAF MiGs (four MiG-21s and seven MiG-17s) and two Air Force F-4s shot down. The VPAF confirmed two MiG-21s, three MiG-17s and one MiG-19 shot down, and they claimed 7 F-4s were shot down (after the war, 5 F-4s shot down were confirmed) Anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missile firings also brought down two USN aircraft (one of which was flown by aces Duke Cunningham and William P. Driscoll).

By the end of the month, American aircraft had destroyed 13 bridges along the rail lines running from Hanoi to the Chinese border. Another four were destroyed between the capital and Haiphong, including the notorious Thanh Hóa Bridge. Several more bridges were brought down along the rail line leading to the south toward the DMZ. Targets were then switched to petroleum and oil storage and transportation networks and North Vietnamese airfields. There was an immediate impact on the battlefield in South Vietnam. Shelling by PAVN artillery dropped off by one-half between 9 May and 1 June. This slowdown was not due to an immediate shortage of artillery shells, but rather to a desire to conserve ammunition. U.S. intelligence analysts believed that PAVN had enough stockpiled supplies to sustain their campaigns throughout the autumn.

The intensity of the bombing campaign was reflected by the sharp increase in the number of strike and support sorties flown in Southeast Asia as a whole: from 4,237 for all services, including the RVNAF, during the month preceding the invasion, to 27,745 flown in support of ARVN forces from the beginning of April to the end of June (20,506 of them flown by the Air Force). B-52s provided an additional 1,000 sorties during the same period. The North was feeling the pressure, admitting in the official PAVN history that &quot;between May and June only 30 percent of supplies called for in our plan actually reached the front-line units.&quot; In total, 41,653 &quot;Linebacker&quot; missions dropped 155,548 tons of bombs.

In addition to interdicting the road and rail system of North Vietnam, &quot;Linebacker&quot; also systematically attacked its air defense system. The VPAF, with approximately 200 interceptors, strongly contested these attacks throughout the campaign. Navy pilots, employing a mutually supporting &quot;loose deuce&quot; tactical formation and many with TOPGUN training, claimed a kill ratio of 6:1 in their favor in May and June, such that after that the VPAF rarely engaged them thereafter. In contrast, the USAF experienced a 1:1 kill ratio through the first two months of the campaign, as seven of its eventual 24 &quot;Linebacker&quot; air-to-air losses occurred without any corresponding VPAF loss in a twelve-day period between 24 June and 5 July. USAF pilots were hampered by use of the outdated &quot;fluid four&quot; tactical formations (a four-plane, two element formation in which only the leader did the shooting and in which the outside wingmen were vulnerable) dictated by service doctrine. Also contributing to the parity was a lack of air combat training against dissimilar aircraft, a deficient early warning system, and ECM pod formations that mandated strict adherence to formation flying. During August the introduction of real-time early warning systems, increased aircrew combat experience and degraded VPAF ground control interception capabilities reversed the trend to a more favorable, with 4:1 kill ratio were claimed.

During the operation, each side would ultimately claim favourable kill ratios. A total of 201 air battles took place between American and Vietnamese planes in 1972 sorties. The VPAF lost 47 MiGs (including 26 MiG-21s, 5 MiG-19s and 16 MiG-17s ) and they claimed 90 U.S. aircraft were shot down, including 74 F-4 fighters and two RF-4C (MiG-21s shot down 67 enemy aircraft, MiG-17s shot down 11 and MiG-19s shot down 12 enemy aircraft

&quot;Linebacker&quot; saw several other &quot;firsts&quot;. On the opening day of the operation, USN Lieutenant Duke Cunningham and his radar intercept officer, Lieutenant (j.g.) William P. Driscoll became the first U.S. air aces of the Vietnam War when they shot down their fifth MiG. On 28 August, the USAF gained its first ace when Captain Richard S. Ritchie downed his fifth enemy aircraft. Twelve days later, Captain Charles B. DeBellevue (who had been Ritchie&#x27;s backseater during four of his five victories) downed two more MiGs, bringing his total to six. On 13 October another weapons officer, Captain Jeffrey S. Feinstein, was credited with his fifth MiG, making him the final Air Force ace.

==Operation Lion&#x27;s Den==
Although &quot;Linebacker&quot; was largely carried out by air, naval forces were also deployed to provide counter-battery fire against enemy targets along the coast and other important logistical areas and in support of ground troops. One such operation was Operation Lion&#x27;s Den, or &quot;The Battle of Haiphong Harbor&quot;. On 27 August 1972, Vice Admiral James L. Holloway III took with him his ship, the heavy cruiser , the guided missile cruiser , and the destroyers and conducted a brief night raid against the North Vietnamese forces protecting the port of Haiphong. After the bombardment, the ships were threatened by four Soviet-built torpedo boats. Joined by two aircraft from the USS &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, three of the four torpedo boats were sunk. It was one of the few ship-to-ship naval battles of the war.

==Paris Peace Talks and conclusion==

The stalled offensive in the South and the devastation in North Vietnam had helped to convince Hanoi to return to the bargaining table by early August. The meetings produced new concessions from Hanoi which promised to end the deadlock that had plagued negotiations since their inception in 1968. Gone were Hanoi&#x27;s demands for the ouster of South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and his replacement by a coalition government in which the Viet Cong would participate. The U.S. on its part agreed to a cease fire in place which conceded that PAVN soldiers could remain in South Vietnam after a peace agreement. The diplomatic impasse was broken and Nixon ordered a halt to all bombing above the 20th parallel on 23 October and on 26 October Kissinger announced that &quot;peace is at hand.&quot; This once again placed Hanoi and Haiphong off-limits, and halted &quot;Linebacker&quot; operations.

Air Force historian Earl Tilford has written that &quot;Linebacker&quot; was &quot;a watershed in aerial warfare...it was the first modern aerial campaign in which precision guided munitions changed the way in which air power was used.&quot; It succeeded, where &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; had failed, he claimed, for three reasons: Nixon was decisive in his actions and gave the military greater latitude in targeting; American airpower was forcefully and appropriately used; and the immense difference in the technology utilized made &quot;Linebacker&quot; the first bombing campaign in a &quot;new era&quot; of aerial warfare.

During and immediately following the PAVN offensive, U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aviators had flown 18,000 sorties in the four northern provinces of South Vietnam and dropped 40,000 tons of ordnance in the Battle of An Lộc. Between March and May, B-52 sortie rates had climbed from 700 to 2,200 per month and they had dropped 57,000 tons of bombs in Quảng Trị Province alone. During &quot;Freedom Train&quot; and &quot;Linebacker&quot; proper, B-52s had dropped 150,237 tons of bombs on the North while Air Force and Navy tactical aircraft had flown 1,216 sorties and dropped another 5,000 tons of ordnance.

From the beginning of &quot;Freedom Train&quot; in April to the end of June 1972 the United States lost 52 aircraft over North Vietnam: 17 to missiles; 11 to anti-aircraft weapons; three to small arms fire; 14 to MiGs; and seven to unknown causes. During the same time period, the RVNAF lost ten aircraft. 63 VPAF aircraft were destroyed during the same time period. North Vietnam claimed that it had shot down 651 aircraft and sunk or set on fire 80 U.S. warships during the operation.

&quot;Linebacker&quot; had played a crucial role in blunting the northern offensive by drying up its vital sources of supply. PAVN had evolved into a conventional military force, and such a force depended upon a complex logistical system, which made it vulnerable to aerial attack. By September, imports into North Vietnam were estimated at 35 to 50 percent below what they had been in May, bolstering claims that the campaign had been successful in its interdiction effort. USAF General Robert N. Ginsburgh, of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, summed up the attitudes of U.S. commanders by remarking that &quot;Linebacker&quot; had &quot;a greater impact in its first four months of operation than &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; had in three and one-half years.&quot; Although Kissinger may have announced that peace was at hand, it was not going to come easily. American bombers would once again return to the skies of North Vietnam in 1972 during Operation Linebacker II before the American commitment to the Vietnam War came to an end.

===North Vietnamese aircraft losses===

<text>Richard Shilleto (25 November 1809 – 24 September 1876), English classical scholar, was born at Ulleskelf in Yorkshire.

He was educated at Repton and Shrewsbury, then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated second classic in 1832. Though Shilleto did not become a fellow of Trinity, marrying Isabella S. H. Snelgar in 1834, he spent the rest of his life in Cambridge as a &#x27;coach&#x27;(private tutor) in classics. His son Arthur Richard Shilleto was born in 1848. In 1867 he was elected a fellow of Peterhouse.

Shilleto was one of the greatest Greek scholars that England has produced; in addition, he had an intimate acquaintance with the Latin and English languages and literature. He published little, being obliged to devote the best years of his life to private tuition. He was the most famous classical coach of his day, and almost all the best men passed through his hands.

His edition of the &quot;De falsa legatione&quot; of Demosthenes will always remain a standard work, but his first two books of Thucydides (an instalment of a long-contemplated edition) hardly came up to expectation. His pamphlet &quot;Thucydides or Grote?&quot; excited a considerable amount of feeling. While it undoubtedly damaged Grote&#x27;s reputation as a scholar, it was felt that it showed a want of appreciation of the special greatness of the historian. Shilleto&#x27;s powers as a translator from English into Greek (especially prose) and Latin were unrivalled; a selection of his versions was published in 1901.

<text>Adobe ImageReady was a bitmap graphics editor that was shipped with Adobe Photoshop for six years. It was available for Windows, Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X from 1998 to 2007. ImageReady was designed for web development and closely interacted with Photoshop.

== Function ==
ImageReady was designed for web development rather than effects-intensive photo manipulation. To that end, ImageReady has specialized features such as animated GIF creation, image compression optimization, image slicing, adding rollover effects, and HTML generation.

Photoshop versions with which ImageReady was released have an &quot;Edit in ImageReady&quot; button that enables editing of image directly in ImageReady. ImageReady, in turn, has an &quot;Edit in Photoshop&quot; button.

ImageReady has strong resemblances to Photoshop; it can even use the same set of Photoshop filters. One set of tools that does not resemble the Photoshop tools, however, is the &quot;Image Map&quot; set of tools, indicated by a shape or arrow with a hand that varied depending upon the version. This toolbox has several features not found in Photoshop, including:
* &quot;Toggle Image Map Visibility&quot; and &quot;Toggle Slice Visibility&quot; tools: toggle between showing and hiding image maps and slices, respectively
* &quot;Export Animation Frames as Files&quot; option: saves all or specified frames for an alternate use, e.g., to e-mail slides for review
* &quot;Preview Document&quot; tool: provides a preview of rollover effects in ImageReady rather than previewing them in a browser
* &quot;Preview in Default Browser&quot; tool: previews the image in a browser, including any rollover or animation effects
* &quot;Edit in Photoshop&quot; button: opens the current image in Photoshop

==History==
Adobe ImageReady 1.0 was released in July 1998 as a standalone application. Version 2.0 was packaged with Photoshop 5.5, and the program was included with Photoshop through version 9.0 (CS2). Starting with Photoshop 7.0, Adobe changed the version numbers of ImageReady to match.

With the release of the Creative Suite 3, ImageReady was discontinued. According to Adobe, ImageReady&#x27;s most popular features were merged into Photoshop. (Even before discontinuation, some of ImageReady&#x27;s web optimization functionality could be found in Photoshop&#x27;s &quot;Save For Web &amp; Devices&quot; tool.) Around the same time, Adobe purchased rival software developer Macromedia, whose application Fireworks had been a competitor to ImageReady.

<doc id="1277423" wikidata="Q137003" url="?curid=1277423" title="50 Greatest Players in NBA History">
<text>The 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, also referred to as NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary All-Time Team, were chosen in 1996 to honor the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA). It was the third anniversary team in the league. Fifty players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers. In addition, the top ten head coaches and top ten single-season teams in NBA history were selected by media members as part of the celebration. The 50 players had to have played at least a portion of their careers in the NBA and were selected irrespective of position played.

The list was announced by NBA commissioner David Stern on October 29, 1996, at the hotel Grand Hyatt New York, the site of the Commodore Hotel, where the original NBA charter was signed in 1946. The announcement marked the beginning of a season-long celebration of the league&#x27;s anniversary. Forty-seven of the fifty players were later assembled in Cleveland, during the halftime ceremony of the 1997 All-Star Game. At the time of the announcement, 11 players were active; all have subsequently retired.

==Players selected==
===List===
Eleven players (Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Robert Parish, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, and John Stockton) were active in the , during which the list was announced. All have since retired. O&#x27;Neal was the last to be active in the NBA, retiring at the end of the . All of the selected players have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. At the time of the list, only Pete Maravich was deceased.

All 11 members from the 35th anniversary team were selected. Eight of the 10 players from the 25th anniversary team were chosen, with Bob Davies and Joe Fulks—who both last played in the 1950s—being omitted.



===Selection process===
The list was made through unranked voting completed by 50 selected panelists. Sixteen of the panelists were former players voting in their roles as players, 13 were members of the print and broadcast news media, and 21 were team representatives: contemporary and former general managers, head coaches, and executives. Of the last group, 13 were former NBA players. Players were prohibited from voting for themselves. Only three voting former players (Bill Bradley, Johnny Kerr, and Bob Lanier) were not selected to the team.

===Voters===

== Top 10 Coaches in NBA History==

Alongside the selection of the 50 greatest players was the selection of the Top 10 Coaches in NBA History. The list was compiled based upon unranked selection undertaken exclusively by members of the print and broadcast media who regularly cover the NBA. All 10 coaches named were alive at the time of the list&#x27;s announcement, and five of them—Bill Fitch, Phil Jackson, Don Nelson, Pat Riley, and Lenny Wilkens—were then active. Six have since died: Red Holzman in 1998, Red Auerbach in 2006, Chuck Daly in 2009, Jack Ramsay in 2014, John Kundla in 2017, and Bill Fitch in 2022. Jackson was the last of the ten to coach in the NBA; he announced his retirement after the 2010–11 season. Nelson was the only member to have never won a championship as a coach, even though he won five as a player. Wilkens was the only member of the coaches list to have been selected as a member of the players list. All ten coaches are also members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, with Fitch the last member inducted in 2019.

==Top 10 Teams in NBA History==
Also included in the NBA&#x27;s 50th-anniversary celebration was the selection of the Top 10 Teams in NBA History. The list was compiled based upon unranked selection undertaken exclusively by members of the print and broadcast media who regularly cover the NBA. Teams were chosen from among all single-season individual teams. Each team won the NBA championship, and they combined to average 66 wins per season. The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls had, at the moment, the best single-season record in NBA history with 72 wins.

Six out of the 30 NBA franchises (29 franchises at the time of announcement) had a team named to the list; the Boston Celtics, the Chicago Bulls, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Philadelphia 76ers had two teams selected.

Six players were on the roster of two teams on the list—Wilt Chamberlain with the 1966–67 Sixers and 1971–72 Lakers; James Edwards, Dennis Rodman, and John Salley with the 1988–89 Pistons and 1995–96 Bulls; and Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen with the Bulls in both 1991–92 and 1995–96. Three other individuals both played for and coached honored teams, all of whom completed this &quot;double&quot; with a single franchise—K. C. Jones with the Celtics as a player in 1964–65 and coach in 1985–86, Billy Cunningham with the Sixers as a player in 1966–67 and coach in 1982–83, and Pat Riley with the Lakers as a player in 1971–72 and coach in 1986–87. Phil Jackson, head coach of the Bulls from 1989 to 1998, was the only man to coach two teams that made the list. Although Jackson was under contract to the Knicks as a player in their 1969–70 championship season, he did not play that season as he was recovering from spinal fusion surgery.

The Hall of Famers listed for each individual team are solely those inducted as players, and do not include those inducted in other roles. Players whose names are italicized were inducted after the announcement of the ten best teams.

<doc id="1277425" wikidata="Q2931834" url="?curid=1277425" title="Cold (novel)">
<text>Cold, first published in 1996, was the sixteenth and final novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including Gardner&#x27;s novelizations of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye&quot;). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

In the United States, the book was retitled &quot;Cold Fall&quot;. This was the first time an original Bond novel had been given a different title for American book publication, other than for reasons of spelling, since Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Moonraker&quot; was initially published there under the title &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; in the mid-1950s. The British title is properly spelled as an acronym (with no full stops), but it is also common to find it spelt &quot;Cold&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The novel is split into two books, one called &quot;Cold Front&quot; and the second entitled &quot;Cold Conspiracy&quot;. The time between each book appears to be the time period allotted to Gardner&#x27;s previous Bond outings, &quot;Never Send Flowers&quot; and &quot;SeaFire&quot;.
The story opens with the crash of a Boeing 747-400 at Dulles International Airport in Fairfax and Loudoun counties, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., and the apparent death of Bond&#x27;s friend and lover, the Principessa Sukie Tempesta. Bond is then sent by M to the airport with an investigation team which leads to meetings with FBI agent Eddie Rhabb.

The main action takes place in Italy at the home of the Tempesta brothers, Luigi and Angelo, where Bond gets caught in the act with one of the brothers&#x27; wives. As James later explains to M, the lady made the advances. The enemy of the story is provided by a terrorist army called COLD, which stands for Children Of the Last Days.

==Major characters==
* James Bond, British Secret Service agent. The FBI sends him to investigate the Tempesta brothers, as part of a complex operation. The real motives behind the FBI involvement are to discover the identity of the leader of COLD, to which the Tempesta family has been recruited.
* M (Sir Miles Messervy), the head of the British Secret Service. Age has finally caught up with him: after being kidnapped by COLD troops, he retires from the Service. At the end of the book, it is mentioned that the new M is a woman, putting everything in continuity with &quot;GoldenEye&quot;.
* Luigi Tempesta - A suave Italian prince, who, behind a façade of legitimate wealth, pulls the strings of a colossal criminal empire.
* General Brutus &quot;Brute&quot; Clay – A retired U.S. Army general, initially described as a crazy has-been with a passion for wargames and historical reenactment. Despite being borderline psychotic, he&#x27;s a brilliant tactician and the commander-in-chief of the Children Of the Last Days.

<doc id="1277426" wikidata="Q1625885" url="?curid=1277426" title="Polish Polar Station, Hornsund">
<text>Polish Polar Station, Hornsund () is at &quot;Isbjørnhamna&quot; in Hornsund, on Spitsbergen in the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago, operated since 1957.

==Station==
The station was erected in July 1957 by the Polish Academy of Sciences Expedition within the framework of the International Geophysical Year. The expedition was led by Stanislaw Siedlecki, geologist, explorer and climber, a veteran of Polish Arctic expeditions in the 1930s (including the first traverse of West Spitsbergen island). A reconnaissance group searching the area for the future station site had been working in Hornsund in the previous summer, and selected the flat marine terrace in Isbjørnhamna. The research station was constructed during three summer months in 1957.

The station was modernized in 1978, in order to resume a year-round activity. Since then, the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences has been responsible for organising year-round and seasonal research expeditions to the station.

==Location==
South Spitsbergen, near the entrance to Hornsund fjord, on its northern shore, at Isbjørnhamna on a flat marine terrace, 10 m above sea level.

==Research==
Current full-year research:

*Meteorology - gathering data for synoptic purposes and to detect climatic changes;
*Seismology - monitoring of world earthquakes, measuring the seismicity of the Spitsbergen Archipelago region, and registering tremors linked to the dynamics of the Hans Glacier;
*Geomagnetism - registering changes in the XYZ components of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field;
*Ionospheric sounding to determine the structure of the ionosphere; using riometer measurements to determine the structure and absorption coefficient of the ionosphere;
*Glaciology - measurements of glacier dynamics (Hansbreen, Werenskioldbreen), documentation of glacier recession;
*Atmospheric electricity - determining the magnitude of the Earth&#x27;s electric field and recording its vertical component; 
*Environmental monitoring - recording of selected climatic features and conducting analyses of chemical buildup of air and water pollution and the isotopic content of the snow cover.

In summers and winters, the station functions as a base for research on geology, geodesics, geomorphology, glaciology, oceanology and biology.

==Time capsule==
On September 17, 2017, near the station, scientific researchers buried a 60-centimeter stainless steel tube containing samples designed to tell finders as long as half a million years into the future, about the current state of knowledge in such areas as geology, biology, and technology.

<doc id="1277439" wikidata="Q1792199" url="?curid=1277439" title="The Song of the Red Ruby">
<text>The Song of the Red Ruby (&quot;Sangen om den røde rubin&quot;, 1956) is a Norwegian novel written by Agnar Mykle. It is a story of the young Ask Burlefot&#x27;s personal ride through shame and letdowns that eventually leads to a closer and deeper understanding of himself. It was controversial in Norway and other countries at the time of publication and ended in court as the so-called Mykle Case. This controversy was due to the explicit sexual descriptions in the adventures of the potent main character. In Norway, the publisher was acquitted, but for instance in Finland the book was confiscated and burnt.

&quot;The Song of the Red Ruby&quot; can also be viewed in connection with &quot;Lasso round the moon&quot; (novel, 1954), &quot;Tyven, tyven skal du hete&quot; (novel, 1951) and &quot;Rubicon&quot; (novel, 1965) as they all have a young man as the protagonist.

The book was later adapted into the feature film &quot;Sangen om den røde rubin&quot; (1970), directed by Annelise Meineche and starring Ole Søltoft and Ghita Nørby.

<doc id="1277441" wikidata="Q3744828" url="?curid=1277441" title="Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival">
<text>The Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival (&quot;The Bloom&quot;) is a 14-day festival held annually in spring in Winchester, Virginia. First held in 1924, it is one of the oldest civic celebrations in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

==History==
The festival was first held Saturday, May 3, 1924, and was originally celebrated as a one-day event (although not held in 1942–1945 due to World War II). Features include a Grand Feature Parade, Firefighters&#x27; Parade (first held on Thursday, April 18, 1929), a carnival and midway, luncheons, races, walks, dances and concerts, as well as a field show competition which formerly gave out the Queen&#x27;s Cup trophy to the winner (although the trophy was retired in 1977, by Princess Anne High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia after winning the competition three straight years). The Queen, Queen Shenandoah, has been crowned every year at John Handley High School (with the exception of 2007, due to ongoing renovations), starting with the original Queen, Elizabeth Steck (Arthur).

A loss of interest during the 1930s, prompted the appointment of Tom Baldridge to the seat of Executive Director of the festival. He was also employed at MGM in the publicity department, which allowed him the opportunity to schedule celebrities, in turn renewing public interest in the festival. The period of the 1960s and 1970s introduced various new aspects to the festival including: the first visit by a U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), the beginning of attendance by sports celebrities Jack Dempsey (1965), and the premier of Sunday in the Park (1975). The Cole Brothers Circus of the Stars, still a favorite of children, first appeared at the festival in 1981.

==The festival today==
The festival is run by the private Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival organization and attracts over 250,000 people. Highlights include the Old Town Wine &amp; Fine Arts Festival and the Apple Blossom Carnival.

The festival is known for its many guest celebrities and events. During the spring, in preparation for the festival, the citizens of Winchester hold an annual clean-up, followed by decoration of the city in green, pink and white (festival colors), in order to make Winchester more presentable for its anticipated guests.

On March 17, 2020 it was announced that planning for the 2020 festival was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively cancelling the event for that year.

The festival was held in 2021 with the theme “Back in Bloom.” Offering 21 events, this 2021 festival was condensed when compared with earlier instances of the festival, which generally presented more than twice that number of events. Restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic were in place for the 2021 festival, such as the requirement that a maximum of 900 people attend the Apple Blossom Carnival at any one time.

<text>George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret (July 1667 – 22 September 1695) was son of Sir Philip Carteret (died 1672) and the grandson of Vice Admiral Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet (died 1680). His mother was Lady Jemima Montagu, a daughter of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich. 

==Biography==
Carteret was left an orphan at the age of five, and was brought up by his grandmother Elizabeth de Carteret, a daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark, whom Samuel Pepys called &quot;the most kind lady in the world&quot;.

In 1681, when Carteret was fourteen, King Charles II created him Baron Carteret, of Hawnes, in recognition of his late grandfather&#x27;s outstanding loyalty to the House of Stuart, both during the English Civil Wars and after the Restoration.

Carteret married Lady Grace Granville, a daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath, and by her was the father of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville and 2nd Baron Carteret.

Carteret died in 1695, aged only 26; his widow outlived him by half a century and in 1715 was created Countess Granville.

<doc id="1277447" wikidata="Q1303897" url="?curid=1277447" title="Bell's vireo">
<text>Bell&#x27;s vireo (Vireo bellii) is a songbird that migrates between a breeding range in Western North America and a winter range in Central America. It is dull olive-gray above and whitish below. It has a faint white eye ring and faint wing bars.

This bird was named by Audubon for John Graham Bell, who accompanied him on his trip up the Missouri River in the 1840s.

The least Bell&#x27;s vireo (&quot;Vireo bellii pusillus&quot;) is an endangered subspecies in Southern California. Consideration of Bell&#x27;s vireo has been a factor in several land development projects, to protect least Bell&#x27;s vireo habitat. The decline of the least Bell&#x27;s vireo is mostly due to a loss of riparian habitat.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 4.5–4.9 in (11.5–12.5 cm)
* Weight: 0.3–0.3 oz (7.4–9.8 g)
* Wingspan: 6.7–7.5 in (17–19 cm)

==Behavior and ecology==
Bell&#x27;s vireos often use dense shrubbery including willows (&quot;Salix spp.&quot;), mulefat (&quot;Baccharis glutinosa&quot;), California wild rose (&quot;Rosa californica&quot;), mugwort (&quot;Artemisia douglasiana&quot;), Fremont cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;), and Western poison oak (&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot;) shrubs or vines as nesting locations. Bell&#x27;s vireos make a well-camouflaged nest but when found they will stand its ground against intruders. As with many other North American songbirds, brown-headed cowbirds parasitise Bell&#x27;s vireo nests, letting the vireos raise their young.

Historically, the least Bell&#x27;s vireo was a common to locally abundant species in lowland riparian habitat, ranging from coastal southern California through the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys as far north as Red Bluff in Tehama County. Populations also occurred in the foothill streams of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges, and in Owens Valley, Death Valley, and scattered locations in the Mojave Desert. Least Bell&#x27;s vireos winter in Baja California Peninsula. Unlike during the breeding season, they are not limited in winter to willow-dominated riparian areas, but occupy a variety of habitats including mesquite scrub within arroyos, palm groves, and hedgerows bordering agricultural and residential areas. At the time of endangered species listing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1986, it had been extirpated from most of its historic range, and numbered just 300 pairs statewide. Populations were confined to eight counties south of Santa Barbara, with the majority of birds occurring in San Diego County. In the decade since listing, least Bell&#x27;s vireo numbers have increased six-fold, and the species is expanding into its historic range. In 1998, the population size was estimated at 2,000 pairs. Nesting least Bell&#x27;s vireos have recolonized the Santa Clara River in Ventura County, where 67 pairs nested in 1998, and the Mojave River in San Bernardino County. The northernmost reported sightings in recent years is of a nesting pair of least Bell&#x27;s vireos near Gilroy in Santa Clara County in 1997 and in the upper Carneros Creek watershed east of Highway 101 in northern Monterey County in 2001. Roughly half of the current least Bell&#x27;s vireo population occurs on drainages within Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, particularly in the lower Santa Margarita River.

<doc id="1277448" wikidata="Q15515099" url="?curid=1277448" title="Matthew Simpson">
<text>Matthew Simpson (June 21, 1811 – June 18, 1884) was an American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, elected in 1852 and based mainly in Philadelphia. During the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War, most evangelical denominations in the North, especially the Methodists, were initially strong supporters of radical policies that favored the Freedmen (former slaves) and distrusted the Southern whites. However, by the late 1860s in border state conferences, the MEC North moved well away from their work with the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and often sided with the grievances of Southern white members. Bishop Simpson played a leading role in mobilizing the Northern Methodists for the cause. His biographer calls him the &quot;High Priest of the Radical Republicans.&quot;

==Early life and family==
Matthew was born in Cadiz, Ohio. His grandfather, Thomas Simpson, was a British soldier who emigrated to Ireland. Matthew&#x27;s father came to America in 1793. Matthew&#x27;s grandfather Tingley was a Revolutionary soldier. Matthew&#x27;s uncle also was Matthew Simpson, who also emigrated from Ireland to America in 1793. This Matthew Simpson represented Harrison County, Ohio, in the Ohio State Senate for ten years, and served as judge of the county court for seven years. In later life, he lived with his nephew, reaching the advanced age of ninety-eight. Matthew, the nephew, married Ellen H. Verner of Pittsburgh.

Matthew was consecrated at birth for the ministry by both of his parents. He was baptized as an infant by Bishop Francis Asbury. He was converted to Christ in 1829. Matthew received an academic education in his hometown. He then attended Madison College in Pennsylvania. Madison subsequently merged into Allegheny College in 1833. Matthew was elected to the office of Tutor in his eighteenth year, then engaging in teaching. Having also studied medicine in 1830–1833, he began medical practice.

==Ministry==
Shortly thereafter, feeling it his duty to enter the ministry, Matthew was licensed to preach in the M.E. Church, and was received on-trial in the Pittsburgh Annual Conference in 1833. He was ordained by Bishop Robert Richford Roberts. Matthew was appointed pastor of the Liberty Street Methodist Church in Pittsburgh in 1835, and of a church at Monongahela, Pennsylvania, in 1836. He was ordained elder in 1837.

The Rev. Simpson was appointed Professor of Natural Science and elected vice-president of Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania. In 1838 he was elected professor, and in 1839 president of the newly established Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle, Indiana, remaining until 1848. The Rev. Simpson was then elected editor of the &quot;Western Christian Advocate&quot;, which he made a strong temperance and anti-slavery organ, from 1848 to 1852.

The Rev. Dr. Matthew Simpson was elected to the episcopacy of his denomination by the M.E. General Conference, May 1852. In discharging his duties, Bishop Simpson visited and presided over conferences in all of the states encompassing the M.E. Church as well as most of the related U.S. Territories. He was sent by the General Conference as a delegate to the Irish and British Wesleyan (i.e., Methodist) Conferences in 1857, as well as to the Evangelical Alliance in Berlin the same year. He traveled with John McClintock. From Berlin, Bishop Simpson extended his travels through Turkey, the Holy Land, Egypt, and Greece, returning to the United States in 1858.

In 1859, Bishop Simpson changed his residence from Pittsburgh to Evanston, Illinois, where he accepted the position of president of the Garrett Biblical Institute (now, Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary). In 1868 he became a Trustee of Drew Theological Seminary (today Drew University), the new Methodist seminary in Madison, NJ, and served as president of its board from 1877 to 1880.

==American Civil War==
Before the Civil War, debates over slavery were highly contentious among Northern Methodists, but Simpson did not take sides, playing instead a moderate and cautious role. With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he became a staunch champion of the Union and helped his denomination take a leading role in providing chaplains, volunteers and civilian support for the war effort.
Simpson became a trusted friend of President Abraham Lincoln, who considered his advice of great value. He attended the family at Lincoln&#x27;s death and gave the sermon at his funeral in Springfield. During the War, Bishop Simpson delivered a number of speeches in behalf of the Union. He was urged by the Secretary of War to undertake the organization of the freedmen at the establishment of the Freedman&#x27;s Bureau. After the war, Bishop Simpson was invited by President Grant to go as a commissioner to San Domingo but he declined both offers.

==More foreign travel==
In 1870, at the death of Bishop Kingsley, Bishop Simpson again visited Europe to complete the work which had been assigned to him on the continent. He also went as a delegate again to the English Wesleyan Conference. In 1874, Bishop Simpson visited Mexico. He returned to Europe in 1875, presiding over the Annual Conference of Germany and Switzerland. He also met with the M.E. missionaries in different parts of Europe. He then addressed the Garfield Memorial Meeting at Exeter Hall, London, on September 24, 1881.
Bishop Simpson was also a gifted orator and throughout the war he gave his much forgotten &quot;Great War Speech&quot; which was so powerful and stirring it could move entire audiences to tears and cheering pride. He delivered this speech over 60 times throughout the war, and it easily motivated and inspired cities wary of the long war.

==Death and burial==
Bishop Matthew Simpson was taken ill at San Francisco in 1880, but recovered to preach the opening sermon at the First Ecumenical Methodist Conference in London (1881). He was present at the M.E. General Conference in 1884, but took little part. He died June 18, 1884, in Philadelphia and was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

<text>Carlos Noriel Lee (born June 20, 1976), nicknamed &quot;El Caballo&quot;, is a Panamanian former professional baseball left fielder and first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1999 to 2012 with the Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, and Miami Marlins. He had 17 career grand slams, ranking him seventh in MLB history (tied with Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams); his seven grand slams hit with the Astros is a club record he shares with Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman.

==Professional career==

===Chicago White Sox===
Lee made his major league debut with the Chicago White Sox on May 7, 1999, hitting a home run in his first Major League at-bat. In his rookie year, Lee hit .293 while driving in 84 runs in 127 games. He finished 7th in the AL Rookie of the Year voting. In 2000, Lee drove in 92 RBI while hitting 24 home runs. In 2001, Lee once again hit for power, hitting 24 home runs and driving in 84 runs but his average dipped from .301 the previous year to .269 in 150 games.

In 2002, Lee played in just 140 games but was consistent once again, driving in 80 runs while hitting 26 home runs. In 2003, Lee had his breakout season for the White Sox, playing in 158 games, Lee drove in 113 RBI while homering 31 times and scoring 100 runs. The following year, Lee continued his success, hitting 31 home runs and scoring 103 runs. He also drove in 99 RBI while hitting .305 for the White Sox.

After the season, Lee was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for outfielder Scott Podsednik and pitcher Luis Vizcaíno.

===Milwaukee Brewers===
In 2005, Lee hit 32 home runs with 114 RBIs and an NL-leading 11 sacrifice flies. He was selected for the National League All-Star team in his first two seasons as a Brewer, and participated in the Home Run Derby in 2005. In 2005, he also won his first career Silver Slugger Award.

On July 28, 2006, he was traded to the Texas Rangers with minor league outfielder Nelson Cruz for outfielders Kevin Mench and Laynce Nix, relief pitcher Francisco Cordero, and minor league pitcher Julian Cordero. According to Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin, the Brewers attempted to re-sign Lee, but by July 27, it became apparent he would not sign a contract extension. The Brewers reportedly offered a four-year, $48 million contract extension, close to the four-year, $50 million extension David Ortiz signed earlier in 2006. Lee&#x27;s agent Adam Katz said the two parties were too far away in negotiations.

===Texas Rangers===
In 59 games for the Rangers, Lee hit 9 home runs while hitting .322 while serving as their DH and left fielder. Between both the Brewers and the Rangers, Lee hit a career high 37 home runs while compiling 116 RBI in 161 games.

===Houston Astros===
On November 24, 2006, Lee agreed to a six-year, $100 million contract with the Houston Astros. Lee had a productive first year in Houston, hitting .303 with 32 home runs and driving in 119 runs, which was good for a three-way tie in the National League with Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder.

In his second year, 2007, despite playing in just 115 games due to injury, Lee drove in 100 runs and homered 28 times for the Astros.

In 2009, he had the lowest range factor of all starting major league left fielders (1.56). Despite his limited range, Lee was a force once again at the plate, driving in 102 RBIs while hitting exactly .300 in 160 games.

In 2010, after Lance Berkman was dealt to the New York Yankees, Lee filled in for a handful of games at first base. While this was not the first time in his career he had played first, it was the first time he did so on a regular basis. Lee hit a career low .246 despite driving in 89 runs and homering 24 times for the Astros. In 2011, he was an above-average defender according to UZR and other statistical measurements.

Through 66 games in 2012 for Houston, Lee struck out just 17 times in 258 at bats. During his 6-year tenure with the Astros, Lee never struck out over 65 times in a season. He set the club record with seven grand slams.

===Miami Marlins===
On July 4, 2012, Lee was traded to the Miami Marlins for minor leaguers Matt Dominguez and Rob Rasmussen. He played his first game as a Marlin the next day against the Milwaukee Brewers, and went 2-for-4 with a run in a win. He hit his first home run as a Marlin, a grand slam, on July 17 against the Chicago Cubs. In 81 games for the Marlins, Lee hit .243 while homering 4 times in 338 plate appearances.

==International career==
Lee represented the Panama national baseball team in international competition. At the 2006 World Baseball Classic, he slashed .182/.250/.182 over 12 plate appearances, with two hits and three strikeouts. At the 2009 World Baseball Classic, he slashed .143/.250/.143 over 8 plate appearances.

==Career statistics==
In 2,099 games over 14 seasons, Lee compiled a .285 batting average (2,273-for-7,983) with 1,125 runs, 469 doubles, 19 triples, 358 home runs, 1,363 RBI, 125 stolen bases, 655 base on balls, 984 strikeouts, .339 on-base percentage and .483 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage playing left field and first base.

==Personal life==
In reference to his nickname, Carlos has a fan club called &quot;Los Caballitos&quot;, which means &quot;Little Horses&quot;. He is married and has two daughters, Cassandra and Karla and two sons, named Karlos and Carlos. Lee owns and operates cattle ranches in Aguadulce and Houston.

His younger brother, also named Carlos, Carlos Humberto Lee, played professional baseball in the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; minor league systems from 2001–2007.

<doc id="1277477" wikidata="Q3228176" url="?curid=1277477" title="The Facts of Death">
<text>The Facts of Death, first published in 1998, was the third novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including Benson&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright—the final James Bond novel to do so—it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam.

The novel&#x27;s title was originally &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, an English translation of the Latin phrase &quot;Orbis non sufficit&quot;, which appears in the novel and film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. The title was later used for the nineteenth James Bond film, released in 1999.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Facts of Death&quot; starts off with several deaths from mysterious diseases. We first find Bond in Cyprus, where a number of British troops have been discovered murdered under mysterious circumstances. Bond gets too close for comfort to the group behind the murders and is attacked, but rescued by a fiery Greek agent, Niki Mirakos, who becomes Bond&#x27;s love interest.

Bond then returns to Britain, where he is invited to attend a dinner party being held by Sir Miles Messervy, the former M. The current M and her boyfriend are also in attendance, and the latter is murdered after the party. M then tells Bond that all of the killings are connected—near all the bodies were statues of Greek deities and numbers, keeping a running count of the victims. 

Bond is sent to Greece and partnered with Niki. They are both suspicious of an internationally-known mathematic cult called the Decada. The head of the group is a Greek mathematician, Konstantine Romanos. Bond goes to Casino au Mont Parnes and beats Romanos in a game of baccarat, catching the attention of an attractive woman named Hera Volopoulos, also a member of the Decada. After she and Bond make love, she drugs Bond and takes him to Konstantine. 

Konstantine orders Hera to kill Bond, but he manages to escape. Bond realises that Konstantine plans to start a major war between Greece and Turkey, and locates his hideout just in time to witness Hera murder Konstantine. She leaves Bond to stop a nuclear missile that will be fired from Greece into Turkey. Hera&#x27;s plan is to profit from the chaos ensuing after she releases a new virus worldwide. Bond, with assistance from the Greek military, kills her and stops the missile.

<text>Thomas John MacLagan (1838 – 20 March 1903) was a Scottish medical doctor and pharmacologist from Perthshire who pioneered the clinical use of thermometers and the use of salicin as an anti-inflammatory and treatment for rheumatism.

== Personal life ==
MacLagan was born in Scone, Perthshire in 1838. He married Isabella Scudamore, from Kent, in 1869. Between the years of 1870 and 1880 they had four children, three sons and a daughter.

== Education ==
He attended Glasgow University at the age of 15, to study humanities before going on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated from there with an MD in 1860, entitled &#x27;On Oxaluria&#x27;. He then spent two years in Europe, visiting medical schools in Paris, Vienna and Munich, where he learned French and German.

== Medical career ==
On his return to Britain MacLagan spent a brief period as resident medical officer at a dispensary in Jersey before returning to Scotland to take up a post in Dundee. He was medical superintendent at Dundee Royal Infirmary from 1864 to 1866, during which time he had to cope with several major fever epidemics of typhus, typhoid, cholera and smallpox and became noted for pioneering the clinical use of thermometers.

He carried out research into the effect of salicin, an extract from willow bark and a known anti-rheumatic treatment. This work was followed by Carl Thiersch, and in 1874 salicylic acid was synthesised, the active ingredient in Aspirin.

He later established a practice in London, having been encouraged to move there by former patients the Earl and Countess of Southesk, and treated patients such as Thomas Carlyle and the royal family. At the time of his death in 1903, it was said that he &quot;deserves a niche in the Temple of Fame as one of the great benefactors of the human race.&quot;

Maclagan&#x27;s original microscope is in the collection of the Tayside Medical History Museum.

== Death ==
MacLagan died in London on 20 March 1903 of stomach cancer at the age of 65.

<text>Saint Sabbatius of Solovki (; died 27 September 1435) was a Russian monk. He was one of the founders of the Solovetsky Monastery, along with Saint Zosimas of Solovki. He was canonized as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church.

==Life==
Sabbatius was a monk at Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. Searching for an even more secluded place for complete solitude and silent prayer, he found out that there was a large deserted island in the White Sea.

He heard of Valaam Monastery on the Lake Ladoga and its monks, who had been leading an austere lifestyle. In 1429, Sabbatius moved to this island. Sabbatius settled near a chapel on the Vyg River. There, he met a monk by the name of German (Herman), who had lived in the woods in solitude. German agreed to accompany Sabbatius on his voyage to the island and stay there with him. When they reached the island, they erected a cross and a hermit&#x27;s cell some 13 km from today&#x27;s Solovetsky Monastery. After Sabbatius&#x27;s death, newly arrived monks began the construction of the monastery which would come to be known as Solovetsky.

== Veneration ==
Since 1547, Sabbatius has been venerated as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church and the wider Eastern Orthodox Church. His feast day is on 27 September and he is also remembered on 8 August along with Saint Zosimas, when their relics were translated on that day in 1566 into a church named in their honour.

<doc id="1277499" wikidata="Q2749107" url="?curid=1277499" title="Islam in Sri Lanka">
<text>Islam is the third largest religion in Sri Lanka, with about 9.7 percent of the total population following the religion. About 1.9 million Sri Lankans adhere to Islam as per the Sri Lanka census of 2012. The majority of Muslims in Sri Lanka are concentrated in the Eastern Province of the island. Other areas containing significant Muslim minorities include the Western, Northwestern, North Central, Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces. Muslims form a large segment of the urban population of Sri Lanka and are mostly concentrated in major cities and large towns in Sri Lanka, like Colombo. Most Sri Lankan Muslims primarily speak Tamil, though it is not uncommon for Sri Lankan Muslims to be fluent in Sinhalese. The Sri Lankan Malays speak the Sri Lankan Malay creole language in addition to Sinhalese and Tamil.

Islam in Sri Lanka traces its origin back to the arrival of Middle Eastern merchants in the Indian Ocean. By the 16th century, Middle Eastern traders&#x27; were the main traders of spice in Sri Lanka, with networks extending to the Middle East. The descendants of these merchants are commonly believed to be the Sri Lankan Moors.

== History ==
With the arrival of Arab traders in the 7th century A.D., Islam began to flourish in Sri Lanka. The first people to profess the Islamic faith were Arab merchants and their native wives, whom they married after having them converted to Islam. By the 8th century A.D., Arab traders had taken control of much of the trade on the Indian Ocean, including that of Sri Lanka. Many of them settled down on the island in large numbers, encouraging the spread of Islam. However, when the Portuguese arrived during the 16th century, many of these Arab traders&#x27; descendants – now called the Sri Lankan Moors – were the main traders in spice, with networks extending to the Middle East. The Portuguese colonists attacked, persecuted, and destroyed the Sri Lankan Moor settlements, warehouses, and trading networks. Many defeated Moors sought refuge from persecution by escaping to the interior of Sri Lanka. The population of Sri Lankan Moors declined significantly during the Portuguese colonial rule due to the pogroms against the Moors. The Sinhalese ruler King Senarat of Kandy gave refuge to some of the Muslims in the central highlands and Eastern Province, Sri Lanka.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Javanese and Malaysian Muslims brought over by the Dutch and British rulers contributed to the growing Muslim population in Sri Lanka. Their descendants, now the Sri Lankan Malays, adopted several Sri Lankan Moor Islamic traditions while also contributing their unique cultural Islamic practices to other Muslim groups on the Island.

The arrival of Muslims from India during the 19th and 20th centuries has also contributed to the growth of Islam in Sri Lanka. Most notably, Pakistani and South Indian Muslims have introduced Shafi&#x27;i and the Hanafi school of thought into Sri Lanka. Most Muslims on the island adhere to the traditional practices of Sunni Islam.

Muslims generally follow Sufi traditions. The Fassiya ash Shazuliya tariqa, which has its headquarters in Ummu Zavaya in M.J.M. Laffir mawatha, Colombo, supported by the Al-Fassi family in the 1870s, is the most prevalent Sufi order among the Sri Lankan Muslims followed by Aroosiyathul qadiriya. The Deobandi Tablighi Jamaat, jamathe islame and thawheed jamath etc. also have centers in Colombo. Sunni scholar Muhammad Abdul Aleem Siddiqi built Hanafi Masjid in Colombo for Sri Lankan Muslims.

In modern times, Muslims in Sri Lanka are handled by the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department, which was established in the 1980s to prevent the continual isolation of the Muslim community from the rest of Sri Lanka. Muslims of Sri Lanka, mostly continue to derive from the Moor and Malay ethnic communities on the island with smaller numbers of converts from other ethnicities, such as the Tamils.

In recent years, Sri Lankan Muslims have become more affected by the growing influence of Salafism; due to investment from Saudi Arabia, Sri Lankan Sufi Muslims have been wary of increasing Wahhabism among Sri Lankan Muslims. The brutal 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings revealed that the radical National Thowheeth Jama&#x27;ath, a Salafi influenced organization, was behind the bombings, leading to increasing censorship of the Salafi movement in Sri Lanka.

In April 2020, the Sri Lankan government made COVID-19 cremations mandatory, saying that burying bodies could contaminate groundwater and spread the disease. Islam prohibits cremation and Muslims make up 10% of the population in Sri Lanka.

In late February 2021, after intense objections from human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the United Nations, the Sri Lankan government decided to allow burials to take place for Muslims. They were to be done on Iranathivu island, a remote island in the Gulf of Mannar. It lies 300 km (186 miles) away from the capital, Colombo, and was chosen because of its low population density.

== Population ==

The districts of Ampara (43%), Trincomalee (42%) and Batticaloa (26%) in Eastern Province have the highest share of Muslims in Sri Lanka, followed by Puttalam (20%), Mannar (17%), Kandy (14%) and Colombo (12%).

== Sri Lankan Moors ==
The Sri Lankan Moors are mostly native speakers of the Tamil language while a few of them speak Sinhala as primary language, and follow Islam as their religion. Sri Lankan Moors comprise 9.30% (2012 Census) of Sri Lanka&#x27;s population, and constitute the largest ethnic group within the Muslim community in the country.

Islam was spread to Sri Lanka by contacts with the merchant ships operated by the Moor traders between Serendib (Old Persian / Arabic name for Sri Lanka), and various ports in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. As per scholars, Sri Lankan Moors are descendant of the Marakkar, Mappilas, Memons and Pathans of South India.

=== Education ===
There are 749 Muslim schools in Sri Lanka, 205 madrasas which teach Islamic education, and an Islamic university in Beruwala (Jamiya Naleemiya). Al Iman Schools in Colombo was the first organization of Islamic schools of its kind, teaching an integrated Islamic curriculum since 2008. In the early 20th century there were few Muslim professionals in accounting, medicine, engineering, etc., but at present they are exceeding the national average. Due to the lack of opportunity in Sri Lanka, many Muslim professionals are emigrating to get jobs abroad, such as to the Middle East, United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The Moors have had better social and economic mobility, thanks to the historic head start they had in getting education and government jobs under the British colonial rule.

=== East Coast Moors ===
In the eastern provinces of the country Muslims are predominant. These Muslims were settled on land given by the Sinhalese King Senarat of Kandy after the Muslims were persecuted by the Portuguese. East coast Sri Lankan Moors are primarily farmers, fishermen, and traders. According to the controversial census of 2007, the Moors are 5% (only Moors, not the entire Muslim population of the eastern province). Their family lines are traced through women, as in kinship systems of the southwest Indian state of Kerala, like the Nairs and some Mappilas, but they govern themselves through Islamic law.

=== West Coast Moors ===
Many moors in the west of the island are traders, professionals or civil servants and are mainly concentrated in Colombo, Kalutara, Beruwala, Dharga Town, Puttalam, Jaffna, Kandy, Matale, Vavuniya and Mannar. Moors in the west coast trace their family lines through their father. Along with those in the Central Province, the surname of many Moors in Colombo, Kalutara and Puttalam is their father&#x27;s first name, thus retaining similarity to the traditional Arab and middle eastern kinship system.

== The Malays ==

The Malays of Sri Lanka originated in Southeast Asia and today consist of about 50,000 persons. Their ancestors came to the country when both Sri Lanka and Indonesia were colonies of the Dutch. Most of the early Malay immigrants were indentured labours, posted by the Dutch colonial administration to Sri Lanka, who decided to settle on the island. Other immigrants were convicts or members of noble houses from Indonesia who were exiled to Sri Lanka and who never left. The main source of a continuing Malay identity is their common Malay language &quot;(Bahasa Melayu)&quot;, which includes numerous words absorbed from Sinhalese and the Moorish variant of the Tamil language. In the 1980s, the Malays made up about 5% of the Muslim population in Sri Lanka and, like the Moors, predominantly follow the Shafi school of thought within Sunni Islam.

== Indian Muslims (Memons, Bohras, Khojas) ==

The Indian Muslims are those who trace their origins to immigrants searching for business opportunities during the colonial period. Some of these people came to the country as far back as Portuguese times; others arrived during the British period from various parts of India. The majority of them came from Tamil Nadu and Kerala states, and unlike the Sri Lankan Moors, are ethnically related to South Indians and number approximately 30,000. The Memon, originally from Sindh (in modern Pakistan), first arrived in 1870; in the 1980s they numbered only about 3,000. They mostly follow the Hanafi Sunni school of Islam.

The Dawoodi Bohras and the Khoja are Shi&#x27;a Muslims who came from western India (Gujarat state) after 1880; in the 1980s they collectively numbered fewer than 2,000. These groups tended to retain their own places of worship and the languages of their ancestral homelands.

<text>Victoria (; ; ) is a town in the western part of Brașov County, Transylvania, Romania. It had a population of 6,446 at the 2021 census.

==Geography==
The town is located in the western part of Brașov County, from the county seat, Brașov, on the border with Sibiu County. In lies in the historical region of Țara Făgărașului, halfway between the Olt River to the north and the Făgăraș Mountains to the south.

==History==
In 1939, the Romanian state signed a contract with the German company Ferrostaal of Essen to build a factory (called &quot;Ucea&quot;) on the site of what is now Victoria. The contract was canceled after Romania declared war on Germany in 1944, during World War II.

The building of the town began in 1949 and it had the provisional names of &quot;Colonia Ucea&quot; and &quot;Ucea Roșie&quot; (Red Ucea), only to be changed in November 1954 to Victoria.

==Climate==
Victoria has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

<doc id="1277505" wikidata="Q2378317" url="?curid=1277505" title="Steam explosion">
<text>A steam explosion is an explosion caused by violent boiling or flashing of water or ice into steam, occurring when water or ice is either superheated, rapidly heated by fine hot debris produced within it, or heated by the interaction of molten metals (as in a fuel–coolant interaction, or FCI, of molten nuclear-reactor fuel rods with water in a nuclear reactor core following a core-meltdown). Steam explosions are instances of explosive boiling. Pressure vessels, such as pressurized water (nuclear) reactors, that operate above atmospheric pressure can also provide the conditions for a steam explosion. The water changes from a solid or liquid to a gas with extreme speed, increasing dramatically in volume. A steam explosion sprays steam and boiling-hot water and the hot medium that heated it in all directions (if not otherwise confined, e.g. by the walls of a container), creating a danger of scalding and burning.

Steam explosions are not normally chemical explosions, although a number of substances react chemically with steam (for example, zirconium and superheated graphite (inpure carbon, C) react with steam and air respectively to give off hydrogen (H2), which may explode violently in air (O2) to form water or H2O) so that chemical explosions and fires may follow. Some steam explosions appear to be special kinds of boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE), and rely on the release of stored superheat. But many large-scale events, including foundry accidents, show evidence of an energy-release front propagating through the material (see description of FCI below), where the forces create fragments and mix the hot phase into the cold volatile one; and the rapid heat transfer at the front sustains the propagation.

==Examples==

High steam generation rates can occur under other circumstances, such as boiler-drum failure, or at a quench front (for example when water re-enters a hot dry boiler). Though potentially damaging, they are usually less energetic than events in which the hot (&quot;fuel&quot;) phase is molten and so can be finely fragmented within the volatile (&quot;coolant&quot;) phase. Some examples follow:
===Natural===
Steam explosions are naturally produced by certain volcanoes, especially stratovolcanoes, and are a major cause of human fatalities in volcanic eruptions. They are often encountered where hot lava meets sea water or ice. Such an occurrence is also called a littoral explosion. A dangerous steam explosion can also be created when liquid water or ice encounters hot, molten metal. As the water explodes into steam, it splashes the burning hot liquid metal along with it, causing an extreme risk of severe burns to anyone located nearby and creating a fire hazard.

===Boiler explosions===
When a pressurized container such as the waterside of a steam boiler ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion. A common operating temperature and pressure for a marine boiler is around and at the outlet of the superheater. A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, which is where the water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually oil-fired burners. When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few psi above atmospheric pressure. This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area on the sides of the boiler. To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the &quot;fire-tube&quot; designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to &quot;water-tube&quot; boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes. Old &quot;fire-tube&quot; boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the fire tubes, or fatigue of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction). A failure of fire tubes forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the fire tubes in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler&#x27;s contents in a large steam explosion. On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship&#x27;s propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship.

Tanks containing crude oil and certain commercial oil cuts, such as some diesel oils and kerosene, may be subject to boilover, an extremely hazardous situation in which a water layer under an open-top tank pool fire starts boiling, which results in a significant increase in fire intensity accompanied by violent expulsion of burning fluid to the surrounding areas. In many cases, the underlying water layer is superheated, in which case part of it goes through explosive boiling. When this happens, the abruptness of the expansion further enhances the expulsion of blazing fuel.

===Nuclear reactor meltdown===
Events of this general type are also possible if the fuel and fuel elements of a water-cooled nuclear reactor gradually melt. The mixture of molten core structures and fuel is often referred to as &quot;Corium&quot;. If such corium comes into contact with water, vapour explosions may occur from the violent interaction between molten fuel (corium) and water as coolant. Such explosions are seen to be fuel–coolant interactions (FCI).
The severity of a steam explosion based on fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) depends strongly on the so-called premixing process, which describes the mixing of the melt with the surrounding water-steam mixture. In general, water-rich premixtures are considered more favorable than steam-rich environments in terms of steam explosion initiation and strength.
The theoretical maximum for the strength of a steam explosion from a given mass of molten corium, which can never be achieved in practice, is due to its optimal distribution in the form of molten corium droplets of a certain size. These droplets are surrounded by a suitable volume of water, which in principle results from the max. possible mass of vaporized water at instantaneous heat exchange between the molten droplet fragmenting in a shock wave and the surrounding water. On the basis of this very conservative assumption, calculations for alpha containment failure were carried out by Theofanous.
However, these optimal conditions used for conservative estimates do not occur in the real world. For one thing, the entire molten reactor core will never be in premixture, but only in the form of a part of it, e.g., as a jet of molten corium impinging a water pool in the lower plenum of the reactor, fragmenting there by ablation and allowing by this the formation of a premixture in the vicinity of the melt jet falling through the water pool. Alternatively, the melt may arrive as a thick jet at the bottom of the lower plenum, where it forms a pool of melt overlaid by a pool of water. In this case, a premixing zone can form at the interface between the melt pool and the water pool. In both cases, it is clear that by far not the entire molten reactor inventory is involved in premixing, but rather only a small percentage. Further limitations arise from the saturated nature of the water in the reactor, i.e., water with appreciable supercooling is not present there. In the case of penetration of a fragmenting melt jet there, this leads to increasing evaporation and an increasing steam content in the premixture, which, from a content &gt; 70% in the water/steam mixture, prevents the explosion altogether or at least limits its strength. Another counter-effect is the solidification of the molten particles, which depends, among other things, on the diameter of the molten particles. That is, small particles solidify faster than larger ones. Furthermore, the models for instability growth at interfaces between flowing media (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Taylor, Conte-Miles, ...) show a correlation between particle size after fragmentation and the ratio of the density of the fragmenting medium (water-vapor mixture) to the density of the fragmented medium, which can also be demonstrated experimentally. In the case of corium (density of ~ 8000 kg/m³), much smaller droplets (~ 3 - 4 mm) result than when alumina (Al2O3) is used as a corium simulant with a density of just under half that of corium with droplet sizes in the range of 1 - 2 cm. Jet fragmentation experiments conducted at JRC ISPRA under typical reactor conditions with masses of molten corium up to 200 kg and melt jet diameters of 5 - 10 cm in diameter in pools of saturated water up to 2 m deep resulted in success with respect to steam explosions only when Al2O3 was used as the corium simulant. Despite various efforts on the part of the experimenters, it was never possible to trigger a steam explosion in the corium experiments in FARO.(Will be continued ...)

If a steam explosion occurs in a confined tank of water due to rapid heating of the water, the pressure wave and rapidly expanding steam can cause severe water hammer. This was the mechanism that, in Idaho, USA, in 1961, caused the SL-1 nuclear reactor vessel to jump over in the air when it was destroyed by a criticality accident. In the case of SL-1, the fuel and fuel elements vaporized from instantaneous overheating.

In January 1961, operator error caused the SL-1 reactor to instantly destroy itself in a steam explosion. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union was feared to cause major steam explosion (and resulting Europe-wide nuclear fallout) upon melting the lava-like nuclear fuel through the reactor&#x27;s basement towards contact with residue fire-fighting water and groundwater. The threat was averted by frantic tunneling underneath the reactor in order to pump out water and reinforce underlying soil with concrete.

In a nuclear meltdown, the most severe outcome of a steam explosion is early containment building failure. Two possibilities are the ejection at high pressure of molten fuel into the containment, causing rapid heating; or an in-vessel steam explosion causing ejection of a missile (such as the upper head) into, and through, the containment. Less dramatic but still significant is that the molten mass of fuel and reactor core melts through the floor of the reactor building and reaches ground water; a steam explosion might occur, but the debris would probably be contained, and would in fact, being dispersed, probably be more easily cooled. See WASH-1400 for details.

===Further examples===
Molten aluminium produces a strong exothermic reaction with water, which is observed in some building fires.

In a more domestic setting, steam explosions can be a result of trying to extinguish burning oil with water, in a process called slopover. When oil in a pan is on fire, the natural impulse may be to extinguish it with water; however, doing so will cause the hot oil to superheat the water. The resulting steam will disperse upwards and outwards rapidly and violently in a spray also containing the ignited oil. The correct method to extinguish such fires is to use either a damp cloth or a tight lid on the pan; both methods deprive the fire of oxygen, and the cloth also cools it down. Alternatively, a non-volatile purpose designed fire retardant agent or simply a fire blanket can be used.

== Practical uses==
===Biomass refinement===
Steam explosive biorefinement is an industrial application to valorize biomass. It involves pressurizing biomass with steam at up to 3 MPa (30 atmospheres) and instantaneously releasing the pressure to produce the desired transformation in the biomass. An industrial application of the concept has been shown for a paper fiber project. 

===Steam turbines===
A water vapor explosion creates a high volume of gas without producing environmentally harmful leftovers. The controlled explosion of water has been used for generating steam in power stations and in modern types of steam turbines. Newer steam engines use heated oil to force drops of water to explode and create high pressure in a controlled chamber. The pressure is then used to run a turbine or a converted combustion engine. Hot oil and water explosions are becoming particularly popular in concentrated solar generators, because the water can be separated from the oil in a closed loop without any external energy. Water explosion is considered to be environmentally friendly if the heat is generated by a renewable resource.

===Flash boiling in cooking===
A cooking technique called flash boiling uses a small amount of water to quicken the process of boiling. For example, this technique can be used to melt a slice of cheese onto a hamburger patty. The cheese slice is placed on top of the meat on a hot surface such as a frying pan, and a small quantity of cold water is thrown onto the surface near the patty. A vessel (such as a pot or frying-pan cover) is then used to quickly seal the steam-flash reaction, dispersing much of the steamed water on the cheese and patty. This results in a large release of heat, transferred via vaporized water condensing back into a liquid (a principle also used in refrigerator and freezer production).

===Other uses===
Internal combustion engines may use flash-boiling to aerosolize the fuel.

<text>A thongdrel (མཐོང་གྲོལ།) or throngdrel is a large appliqué (གོས་དྲུབ།) religious image normally only unveiled during &quot;tsechus(ཚེ་བཅུ།)&quot;, the main religious festivals in Bhutan. They are the largest form of &quot;thangka(ཐང་ཀ།)&quot; paintings in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Thongdrels typically depict a seated Guru Rinpoche surrounded by holy beings in a composition that, unlike most smaller thangkas, is in a &quot;landscape&quot; format, somewhat wider than it is tall.

Thongdrels are composed of several layers, mostly of silk. These begin with a backing, then the image itself, made up of appliqué pieces sewn to a background. Finally there is a yellow drape that covers and protects it when not on display. Thongdrels are stored rolled up. Thongdrels are displayed once a year as the highlight of the tsechu festival of a district or &quot;dzongkhag&quot; (although not every district has a thongdrel). Typically they are displayed on the last day of the tsechu. The painting is not allowed to be struck by the direct rays of the sun, thus it may be unfurled at around 3:00 in the morning and rolled back up by 7:30 AM. 

Usually the architecture of the dzong provides a wall with access above, down which they may be unrolled, but sometimes metal hanging frames may be used. Major Tibetan centres have thangka walls, structures built into the defensive walls or other buildings specifically designed to give a large space for the display of festival thangkas. 

The mere viewing of the unfurled thongdrel is said to cleanse the viewer of negative karma. They may also be exhibited at other important occasions such as royal coronations, when the thongdrel from a number of monasteries may be transported to appear.

<doc id="1277510" wikidata="Q1630233" url="?curid=1277510" title="Greg Anthony">
<text>Gregory Carlton Anthony (born November 15, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player who is a television analyst for NBA TV and Turner Sports. He played 11 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Anthony also contributes to Yahoo! Sports as a college basketball analyst and serves as a co-host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio. His son, Cole Anthony, plays for the Orlando Magic.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, Anthony aspired to enter politics. He wanted to become Nevada&#x27;s first black Senator. A graduate of Rancho High School in North Las Vegas, Nevada, Anthony played his freshman year of college basketball for the University of Portland where he was the WCC Freshman of the Year before transferring to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In his junior season with UNLV, the Runnin&#x27; Rebels won the 1990 NCAA Championship game over Duke with Anthony starting at point guard, as UNLV blew out the Blue Devils and Christian Laettner by 30 points. He played almost the entire season with a broken jaw. He was a three-time All Big West performer and 3rd Team All America his senior season. This talented team was coached by Jerry Tarkanian and also included future NBA players Stacey Augmon and Larry Johnson. In March 2011, HBO premiered a documentary entitled &quot;Runnin&#x27; Rebels of UNLV&quot;.

During summer breaks, Anthony worked at the World Economic Summit and on Capitol Hill as an intern to for Rep. Barbara Vucanovich. He also started a T-shirt and silkscreening business, Two-Hype, while attending UNLV. His entrepreneurial endeavor was the reason why he relinquished his athletic scholarship. Anthony made enough money selling T-shirts that he was able to pay for his own tuition.

==NBA career==

=== New York Knicks (1991–1995) ===

Anthony was drafted by the New York Knicks in the first round of the 1991 NBA draft, with the reputation of being a poor outside shooter but an excellent defender. He served as a point guard and defensive specialist, and typified the hard-nosed defensive reputation of Pat Riley&#x27;s Knicks. On May 24, 1994, Anthony scored 16 points off the bench during a 100-89 Eastern Conference Finals Game 1 win over the Indiana Pacers. The Knicks would ultimately beat the Pacers to advance to the 1994 NBA Finals, but lose to the Houston Rockets in a hard-fought seven-game series.

=== Vancouver Grizzlies (1995–1997) ===
In 1995, Anthony was drafted in the 1995 NBA expansion draft as the 1st pick (2nd overall) by the Vancouver Grizzlies, where he would be the full-time starter at point guard for two seasons. On January 5, 1996, Anthony scored a career-high 32 points during a 103–102 overtime win against the 76ers.

===Seattle SuperSonics (1997–1998)===
In August 1997, Anthony was released by the Grizzlies. In October 1997, he signed as a free agent with the Seattle SuperSonics. Anthony played one season in Seattle, appearing in 80 games in the 1997–98 season, averaging 5.2 points per game. The Sonics finished the season with a 61–21 record but lost in the Western conference semifinals to the Los Angeles Lakers.

=== Portland Trail Blazers (1999–2001) ===
In January 1999, Anthony was released by the Sonics and signed a contract with the Portland Trail Blazers. He would spend three seasons playing in Portland.

===Chicago Bulls (2001–2002)===
As part of a trade in July 2001, Anthony was sent to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for a 2002 second round pick (Jason Jennings was later selected). Anthony would play 36 games for the Bulls in the 2001–02 season.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2002)===
Anthony was released by the Bulls and signed a contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, his final stop in the NBA. The Bucks would miss the playoffs and Anthony played his final NBA game on April 17, 2002, recording two points, six rebounds, and six assists in a loss to the Detroit Pistons.

== Broadcasting career ==
Upon retirement, Anthony joined ESPN as an analyst for both NBA coverage on ESPN and ABC.

On December 13, 2008, Anthony made his debut as a college basketball analyst for CBS Sports, replacing Clark Kellogg, who was promoted to lead commentator.

Anthony agreed to be a color commentator for the YES Network covering the Brooklyn Nets for the 2012–2013 season alongside Ian Eagle, Mike Fratello, and Jim Spanarkel.

In 2014, Anthony and Kellogg swapped their respective roles at CBS Sports, with Anthony moving to the broadcast booth as a lead commentator and Kellogg returning to his previous role as a studio analyst.

Anthony has been featured as a commentator in the NBA 2K series of video games since &quot;NBA 2K16&quot;.

==Off court==

===Personal life===
Anthony is married to Chere Lucas Anthony, a dermatologist, with whom he has one daughter and one son. He has two other children from a previous marriage to Crystal McCrary, Cole and Ella Anthony. Cole was the starting point guard for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels and was drafted by Orlando Magic in the NBA 2020 draft with the 15th pick in the first round.

===Politics===
Anthony has been politically active with the Republican Party since his days at UNLV, where he graduated with a degree in political science and served as the vice chairman of Nevada&#x27;s Young Republicans.

In 2012, Anthony publicly endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, appearing in a Romney ad in Nevada.

===Arrest===
On January 16, 2015, Anthony was arrested in Washington, D.C., and charged with soliciting a prostitute. Following his arrest, Anthony was indefinitely suspended by CBS and Turner Sports. On February 11, Anthony reached a deferred prosecution agreement in which the charge would be dropped provided he completed 32 hours of community service and stayed out of trouble for four months.

In March 2016, Anthony was dropped by CBS, but returned to Turner as a studio analyst for NBA TV, and as a fill-in analyst for the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; during the regular season and the playoffs.

<text>John McClintock (October 27, 1814 – March 4, 1870) was an American Methodist Episcopal theologian and educationalist, born in Philadelphia.

==Early life and education==
McClintock was born in Philadelphia, on October 27, 1814. He matriculated at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Ill health, however, forced him to leave Wesleyan in his freshman year. He returned to Philadelphia, where he graduated with an A M. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1835.

==Career==
He was assistant professor of mathematics (1836–1837), professor of mathematics (1837–1840), and professor of Latin and Greek (1840–1848) at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He opposed the Mexican–American War, as well as slavery, but did not consider himself an abolitionist.

In 1847, McClintock was arrested on the charge of instigating a riot, which resulted in the rescue of several fugitive slaves; his trial, in which he was acquitted, attracted wide attention. The trial dealt with the issue of Personal liberty laws in the North and the fugitive slave crisis.

&quot;When Stephen Olin, president of Wesleyan died, the chair was offered to McClintock, but he preferred the call to the editorship of &quot;The Methodist Quarterly Review&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Methodist Review&quot;, a post he held for eight years, from 1848 to 1856. In 1855, He declined the presidency of Troy University.

From 1857 to 1860, McClintock was pastor of St. Paul&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church in New York City. From 1860 to 1864, he was in charge of the American chapel in Paris. There and in London, he did much to turn public opinion in favor of the Northern States.
In 1865 to 1866, he was chairman of the central committee for the celebration of the centenary of American Methodism. He retired from the regular ministry in 1865, but preached in New Brunswick, New Jersey, until the spring of 1867, and in that year, at the wish of its founder, Daniel Drew, became the first president of the newly established Drew Theological Seminary at Madison, New Jersey (later, Drew University), where he died. At Drew, McClintock also served as professor of practical theology from 1867 until his death in 1870.

A great preacher, orator, and teacher, and a remarkably versatile scholar, McClintock by his editorial and educational work probably did more than any other man to raise the intellectual tone of American Methodism, and, particularly, of the American Methodist clergy.

==Works==
He introduced to his denomination the scholarly methods of the new German theology of the day by his translation with Charles E. Blumenthal of Neander&#x27;s &quot;Life of Christ&quot; (1847), and of Félix Bungener&#x27;s &quot;History of the Council of Trent&quot; (1855), and also by his great project, McClintock and Strong&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopædia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature&quot; (10 vols., 1867–1881; &quot;Supplement&quot;, 2 vols., 1885–1887), in the editing of which he was associated with James Strong (1822–1894), professor of exegetical theology in the Drew Theological Seminary from 1868 to 1893, and the sole supervising editor of the last six volumes of the &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot; and of the supplement.

With George Richard Crooks (1822–1897), his colleague at Dickinson College and in 1880–1897 professor of historical theology at Drew Seminary, McClintock edited several elementary textbooks in Latin and Greek (of which some were republished in Spanish), based on the pedagogical principle of imitation and constant repetition.
Among McClintock&#x27;s other publications are:
* &quot;Sketches of Eminent Methodist Ministers&quot; (1863)
* an edition of Richard Watson&#x27;s &quot;Theological Institutes&quot; (1851)
* &quot;The Life and Letters of Rev. Stephen Olin&quot; (1854).

<doc id="1277518" wikidata="Q1631002" url="?curid=1277518" title="High Time to Kill">
<text>High Time to Kill, published in 1999, is the fourth novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including Benson&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;). This is the first James Bond novel copyrighted by Ian Fleming Publications (formerly Glidrose Publications). It was published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The novel&#x27;s working title was &quot;A Better Way to Die&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Bond faces off against a ruthless terrorist organisation called &quot;The Union&quot;, whose trademark assassination technique is throat-slitting. Bond and his girlfriend Helena are attending a dinner party thrown by a former Governor of the Bahamas. The Governor, who owes a gambling debt to a member of The Union, has refused to pay up since he believes he was cheated. Accordingly, there is a heightened security presence at the event. However, an assassin disguises himself as one of the guards and kills the Governor, just as Bond realises the danger. Bond almost catches the assassin, who commits suicide before he can be interrogated.

A top secret British formula hidden in microfilm, codenamed &quot;Skin 17&quot;, is stolen by two traitors, scientist Steven Harding and RAF officer Roland Marquis. The microdot is surgically implanted in the pacemaker of an unhealthy old man named Lee Ming, a former Chinese intelligence agent. Bond is sent to recover it before the Union can sell the microfilm to a foreign power.

Bond tracks Harding and Lee to Belgium, but they slip away while Bond fights and kills Harding&#x27;s bodyguard Basil. MI6 tracks Lee to Nepal. It turns out, however, that Harding plans to double-cross the Union by having the plane carrying Lee hijacked. Le Gerant, the blind leader of The Union, immediately deduces Harding&#x27;s double-cross and has him executed; Harding&#x27;s body later washes up on the beach at Gibraltar.

The plane carrying Lee crashes in the Himalayas, so a deadly race between several parties commences to recover Skin 17. Bond, sexy mountaineer Hope Kendall, and Marquis, who was Bond&#x27;s rival in their schoolboy days, lead one of the expeditions. Early on, they destroy the Chinese base camp, forcing that team to withdraw. Not long after, however, everyone on the British expedition is killed, save for Bond, Hope and Marquis. It turns out that Marquis was in on the theft with Harding, though they don&#x27;t plan to sell it to The Union. The race climaxes with Bond battling Marquis atop the peak of Kangchenjunga. After a physical high-elevation fight, Bond trades oxygen from a mortally wounded Marquis for Skin 17. Bond and Hope return to base camp to find Paul Baack, a team member believed to have died with the rest, who reveals his affiliation with the Union and demands Skin 17. Bond and Hope manage to kill Baack and Skin 17 is returned to the British.

Meanwhile, Helena reveals herself to be a reluctant agent for The Union, who threatened to harm her family if she did not do their bidding, but she is killed before Bond can reach her.

<text>Juan de Valladolid (English: &quot;John of Valladoid&quot;) (c.1420–?), also known as Juan Poeta (&quot;John the poet&quot;), was a Castilian poet. Born Jewish, he converted to Christianity later in life. As a &quot;converso&quot; or a baptized Jew, he married a Christian woman named Jamila. 

Born in Valladolid, Juan de Valladolid lived for some time at the courts in Naples and Milano, where he was an astrologer. On his way back to Spain, he was taken prisoner by pirates who took him to Fez. It was reported he had converted to Islam and also married a Moorish woman in Fez. He eventually traveled to Spain where he became known as a poet and made the acquaintance of , where the two would exchange satirical poems. 

With his conversion being widely known, contemporary poets refer to him invariably as &quot;Juan el Judío&quot; (&quot;John the Jew&quot;) and he was held in high regard by Queen Isabella of Spain. His poems are found throughout various collections, including the &quot;Cancionero de Antón de Montoro.&quot;

<text>Leng Tch&#x27;e is a Belgian grindcore band. The band describes their style as &quot;razorgrind&quot;, a combination of grindcore with death metal, stoner rock and metalcore. The band&#x27;s name is an alternate romanisation of &quot;língchí&quot;, a method of torture and execution originating from Imperial China that is also known as &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;. &quot;Death by a Thousand Cuts&quot; is also the name of one of the band&#x27;s albums.

==Biography==
Leng Tch&#x27;e drummer Sven is Aborted frontman Gurgloroth &#x27;Svencho&#x27; Sven De Caluwé. The band began life under the billing of Anal Torture, forged by Sven and Dark Ages guitarist Glen along with vocalist Isaac and bass player Kevin in early 2002. Leng Tch&#x27;e signed to the Italian Spew label for the opening 2002 album &quot;Death by a Thousand Cuts&quot;. After that album, the band released a split 7-inch single with Black Ops.

The band would employ Israeli guitarist Nir &#x27;The Goat&#x27; Doliner of Lehavoth, even undertaking gigs in Israel opening for Amon Amarth. Unable to secure a bassist Nicolas would switch from guitar to cover this role. Eventually the distance factor for Doliner prevented a full-time role. In early 2004 therefore the band inducted Geert as second guitarist. The band enrolled former Pyaemia bassist Frank Rizzo as guitarist in late 2003. Meantime, Isaac founded a noise side project billed as Permanent Death whilst vocalist Sven De Caluwé would front In-Quest for an album.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;ManMadePredator&quot;, was released in May 2003. Leng Tch&#x27;e proposed split releases in 2004 with Fuck...I&#x27;m Dead for No Escape Records and a split 7-inch single with Gronibard on Bones Brigade Records. Guitarist Rizzo decamped in August, being replaced in November by Jan of Spleen. In early 2005 the band inducted Boris of Suppository as new frontman, debuting this revised line-up at 30 April &#x27;Face Your Underground&#x27; festival in Antwerp.

Leng Tch&#x27;e contracted to Relapse Records in March, scheduling a summer release date for new album &quot;The Process of Elimination&quot;. The band played May US East Coast dates along with Impaled, Malignancy and Aborted. The band partnered with Fuck the Facts and Beneath the Massacre for a Canadian tour in 2006.

On March 9, 2007, a new album, &quot;Marasmus&quot;, was released on Relapse Records. Some commentators noted that the album was closer to the deathcore sound.

On May 16, 2008, The band announced that Boris had decided to quit the band.

A successor was found in Serge Kasongo, formerly of Ackros with whom the band toured Canada in 2008 alongside Krisiun. Recording for the followup to &quot;Marasmus&quot; started in 2009 with a release planned for the spring of 2010 on new record label Season Of Mist. The album was named &quot;Hypomanic&quot; and mixed and mastered by Russ Russell (Napalm Death, Brujeria, Evile).

The band toured with Origin and Psycroptic in early 2012 in support of &quot;Hypomanic&quot;.

==Influences==

<doc id="1277536" wikidata="Q3037825" url="?curid=1277536" title="DoubleShot">
<text>DoubleShot, first published in 2000, was the sixth novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s secret agent, James Bond (including film novelizations). Carrying the Ian Fleming Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The novel&#x27;s working title was &quot;Doppelganger&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;DoubleShot&quot;, the second novel in Raymond Benson&#x27;s &quot;Union&quot; trilogy, again sets James Bond, 007 against the evil terrorist organization called the Union. Still smarting from their last encounter with 007 when he foiled their plans to get Skin 17 in &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;, the Union has decided that Britain and James Bond are their new number one priority, and targets. Coming up with an elaborate plan to plunge Britain into war and destroy Bond&#x27;s reputation in the process, the Union sets up their scheme. Domingo Espada, a Spanish Nationalist/Gangster/Ex-Matador who wishes to see Gibraltar returned to Spain from Britain, is approached by Nadir Yassasin, the Union&#x27;s master strategist, as the centrepiece to their plan. They plan to help Espada forcefully take control of Gibraltar, killing the British Prime Minister and the Governor of Gibraltar, and having a Bond-Double do it, thus ruining Bond&#x27;s career and life. But first, through an elaborate series of events, they convince Bond he is losing his mind, and force him to investigate these happenings on his own, without approval from M or SIS.

Since Bond&#x27;s return from the Himalayas, he begins experiencing terrible headaches, hallucinations, and black-outs. This leads him to Dr. Kimberly Feare. She diagnoses a lesion on the back of Bond&#x27;s skull that is causing these symptoms. After getting Dr. Feare in bed, Bond wakes up to find her murdered, her throat slit ear-to-ear, the Union&#x27;s mark. This causes Bond to leave England. Bond&#x27;s trek takes him from England to Tangier, where he encounters the Taunt twins, Heidi and Hedy, CIA agents asked by M to bring him back to London. Here Bond finds the connection between the Union and Espada, and that he has some part in the Union&#x27;s plan. Convincing M and the Taunts to play out his hand, Bond goes to Spain. On arrival in Spain, he encounters Margareta Piel, Espada&#x27;s female assassin and a member of the Union. Followed closely by the climax of Bond vs. his double in Espada&#x27;s practice bullfighting ring, and the culmination of the Union&#x27;s plot at the Gibraltar peace conference, Bond takes his double&#x27;s place and along with the Taunt twins, prevent the assassinations, kills Espada, Piel, Jimmy Powers (a high-ranking American in the Union, and their number one expert in stealth and tailing), and captures Yassasin, foiling the Union&#x27;s plans once again.

<doc id="1277537" wikidata="Q5441453" url="?curid=1277537" title="Feenmärchen waltz">
<text>Feenmärchen (Fairy-tales) waltz op. 312 is composed by Johann Strauss II in 1866. The same year had witnessed the glaring military weakness of the ailing Habsburg dynasty after a bitter defeat to the hands of the Prussian army at the fateful Battle of Königgrätz. Almost immediately, various Vienna&#x27;s establishments usually packed with music-lovers dancing the night away took the news with foreboding and many of the year&#x27;s festivities were cancelled or with-held.

It was during these difficult social times that Strauss and his famous brothers entertained and coaxed the Viennese into enjoying their once-enviable lifestyle again. One such work, the &#x27;Feenmärchen&#x27; waltz was first performed at the Vienna Volksgarten on 18 November 1866 during a benefit concert for brothers Josef and Eduard before an adoring public.
Themes from the work was also included by Antal Doráti in his pastiche ballet Graduation Ball (1940) where the plaintive Introduction makes a contribution. The work starts off in a plaintive mood, with the clarinet playing the principal melody. Further themes were suggested before a loud chord introduces the first waltz theme. The entire &#x27;fairy-tale&#x27; work was given inspiration throughout its light-hearted menagerie with various instruments of the orchestra. The first waltz theme was played again at the end before a furious section rounds off the work with a strong chord and drumroll.

<text>The Egyptian pound ( ; abbreviations: £, E£, £E, LE, or EGP in Latin, and  in Arabic, ISO code: EGP) is the official currency of Egypt. It is divided into 100 piastres, or qirsh ( ; &quot;plural&quot; ; abbreviation: PT (short for &quot;piastre tarif&quot;)) and was historically divided into 1,000 milliemes (  ; , abbreviated to &quot;m&quot; or &quot;mill&quot;).

Since July 6, 2022, the 10- and 20-pound notes have been made out of polymer plastic paper.

==History==
At the beginning of the 19th century, Egypt and Turkey shared a common currency, the Ottoman piastre, divided into 40 paras. However, under Muhammad Ali, Egypt started to issue its own coinage, and in 1834, by which time Egypt was now nominally independent from Ottoman rule, a decree was issued, adopting an exclusively Egyptian monetary system whereby Egypt went into a silver and gold bimetallic standard based on the Maria Theresa thaler rated at 20 piastres. The Maria Theresa thaler was a popular silver trade coin in the region around that time. In the wake of this currency reform, Egypt minted a gold coin known as the bedidlik, equal to 100 piastres, and a silver rial coin of 20 piastres corresponding to the Maria Theresa thaler. In 1839, a piastre contained 1.146 grams of silver, and meanwhile the British gold sovereign was rated at 97.5 piastres. While 100 Egyptian piastres and the bedidlik coin were referred to as a pound in the English speaking world, this was not the principle unit in the new Egyptian monetary system of 1834. Reference to an Egyptian pound unit of account appeared in 1884 on a E£50 promissory note signed by General Gordon at the Siege of Khartoum, but it wasn&#x27;t until the next year in 1885 that this unit of account would become the official unit.

Meanwhile, back in 1840, despite Egypt&#x27;s separate coinage, it was agreed under the Turkish-Egyptian treaty dated that same year, that the Turkish and Egyptian strikes should nevertheless maintain equal value. However, in 1844, the Ottoman piastre was devalued in conjunction with the creation of a new Ottoman lira unit, and Egypt didn&#x27;t follow suit. Hence the Egyptian and Turkish units split from each other in value, with the Egyptian unit continuing its exchange value of 97.5 piastres to the pound sterling.

In 1885, Egypt went into a purely gold standard, and the Egyptian pound unit, known as the , was introduced at E£1 = 7.4375 grammes of fine gold. This unit was chosen on the basis of the gold content in the British gold sovereign and maintaining the exchange value of 97.5 piastres to the pound sterling, and it replaced the Egyptian piastre () as the chief unit of currency. This reform resulted in the Maria Theresa thaler being adjusted to 21 piastres, with 20 piastres now being rated at 5 French francs, and the foreign exchange rates were fixed by force of law for the important currencies which had become acceptable in the settlement of internal transactions. It wasn&#x27;t however until 1899 that banknotes started to appear with the word &quot;pounds&quot; on them, written in English.
Meanwhile, the piastre continued to circulate as of a pound, the para was discontinued in 1909, and the piastre was divided into tenths ( ). These tenths were renamed milliemes () in 1916.

Then, at the outbreak of World War I, with the gold specie standard being suspended in the UK, the Egyptian pound used a sterling peg of one pound and sixpence sterling to one Egyptian pound. Inverted, this gives E£0.975 for one pound sterling.

This exchange value of 97.5 piastres to the pound sterling continued until the early 1960s when Egypt devalued slightly and switched to a peg to the United States dollar, at a rate of E£1 = US$2.3.
The Egyptian pound was also used in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan between 1899 and 1956, and Cyrenaica when it was under British occupation and later an independent emirate between 1942 and 1951. It also circulated in Mandatory Palestine from 1918 to 1927, when the Palestine pound was introduced.

The Egyptian pound continued with its exchange rate of E£ = £1 0s 6d sterling up until the beginning of the 1960s.
==Nomenclature ==

===Used for historical values or in vernacular speech===
Several unofficial popular names are used to refer to different denominations of Egyptian currency. These include (from the word &quot;&quot;) &quot;nekla&quot; () for 2 milliemes, &quot;ta&#x27;rifa&quot; () for 5 milliemes, 
&quot;nos franc&quot; () for 2 piastres, () (i.e. a shilling) for 5 piastres, &quot;bariza&quot; () for 10 piastres, and &quot;reyal&quot; (ريال) (&quot;real&quot;) for 20 piastres.
Since the piastre and millieme are no longer legal tender, the smallest denomination currently minted being the 25 PT coin (functioning as one-quarter of E£1), these terms have mostly fallen into disuse and survive as curios. A few have survived to refer to pound notes: &quot;bariza&quot; now refers to the E£10 note and &quot;reyal&quot; can be used in reference to the E£20 note.

===Informal===
Different sums of the Egyptian pound have nicknames in vernacular speech, for example: E£1 &quot;bolbol&quot; () &quot;nightingale&quot; or &quot;gondi&quot; () &quot;soldier&quot;; E£1,000 &quot;bako&quot; () &quot;pack&quot;; E£1,000,000 &quot;arnab&quot; () &quot;rabbit&quot;; E£1,000,000,000 &quot;feel&quot; () &quot;elephant&quot;.

== Coins ==
Between 1837 and 1900, copper 1 and 5 para, silver 10 and 20 para, 1, 5, 10 and 20 piastre (pt), gold 5pt, 10pt. and 20pt and E£1 coins were introduced, with gold 50 PT coins issued in 1839.

Copper 10 para coins were introduced in 1853, although the silver coin continued to be issued. Copper 10 para coins were again introduced in 1862, followed by copper 4 para and 2 PT coins in 1863. Gold 25 PT coins were introduced in 1867.

In 1885, the para was replaced by the millieme in order to decimalise the currency and a new coinage was introduced. The issue consisted of bronze , , 1, 2 and 5 millieme (m), silver 1 PT, 2 PT, 5 PT, 10 PT and 20 PT coins. The gold coinage practically ceased, with only small numbers of 5 PT and 10 PT coins issued.

In 1916 and 1917, a new base metal coinage was introduced consisting of bronze m and holed, cupro-nickel 1m, 2m, 5m and 10m coins. Silver 2 PT, 5 PT, 10 PT and 20 PT coins continued to be issued, and a gold E£1 coin was reintroduced. Between 1922 and 1923, the gold coinage was extended to include 20 PT and 50 PT and E£1 and E£5 coins. In 1924, bronze replaced cupro-nickel in the 1m coin and the holes were removed from the other cupro-nickel coins. In 1938, bronze 5m and 10m coins were introduced, followed in 1944 by silver, hexagonal 2 PT coins.

Between 1954 and 1956, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of aluminium-bronze 1m, 5m and 10m and silver 5 PT, 10 PT and 20 PT coins, with the size of the silver coinage significantly reduced. An aluminium-bronze 2m coin was introduced in 1962. In 1967 the silver coinage was abandoned and cupro-nickel 5 and 10 piastre coins were introduced.

Aluminium replaced aluminium-bronze in the 1m, 5m and 10m coins in 1972, followed by brass in the 5m and 10m coins in 1973. Aluminium-bronze 2 PT and cupro-nickel 20 PT coins were introduced in 1980, followed by aluminium-bronze 1 PT and 5 PT coins in 1984. In 1992, brass 5 and 10 piastre coins were introduced, followed by holed, cupro-nickel 25 piastre coins in 1993. The size of 5 PT coins was reduced in 2004, 10 PT and 25 PT coins - in 2008.

On 1 June 2006, 50 PT and E£1 coins dated 2005 were introduced, and its equivalent banknotes were temporarily phased out from circulation in 2010. The coins bear the face of Cleopatra VII and Tutankhamun&#x27;s mask, and the E£1 coin is bimetallic. The size and composition of 50 PT coins was reduced in 2007.



==Banknotes==

In 1899, the National Bank of Egypt introduced notes in denominations of 50 PT, £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100. Between 1916 and 1917, 25 PT notes were added, together with government currency notes for 5 PT and 10 PT issued by the Ministry of Finance. In 1961, the Central Bank of Egypt took over from the National Bank and issued notes in denominations of 25 and 50 piastres, £1, £5, £10 and £20 notes were introduced in 1976, followed by £100 in 1978, £50 in 1993 and £200 in 2007.

All Egyptian banknotes are bilingual, with Arabic texts and Eastern Arabic numerals on the obverse, and English texts and Western Arabic numerals on the reverse. Obverse designs tend to feature an Islamic building with reverse designs featuring Ancient Egyptian motifs (buildings, statues and inscriptions). During December 2006, it was mentioned in articles in &quot;Al Ahram&quot; and &quot;Al Akhbar&quot; newspapers that there were plans to introduce £200 and £500 notes. As of 2024, there are £200 notes circulating but there are still no plans for issuing £500 notes. Starting from 2011 the 25 PT, 50 PT and £1 banknotes were phased out in favour of more extensive use of coins. However, as of June 2016 the National Bank of Egypt reintroduced the £1 banknote into circulation as well as 25 PT and 50 PT notes in response to a shortage of small change.

The governor of the Central Bank of Egypt announced that the Central Bank of Egypt will issue polymer notes by the beginning of 2021. This change comes as the CBE moves its headquarters to the new administrative capital. On July 31, 2021, the President of Egypt reviewed the notes of £10 and £20, to be issued in November 2021. In August 2021, the Central Bank was forced to confirm that rainbow holograms on the new banknotes were a secure watermarking feature to prevent counterfeiting, after online critics suggested it was a covert message of support for LGBT rights. Just nearly 2 years after the £10 note was released, the Central Bank of Egypt released the new £20 polymer banknote. The paper variants of the same denominations will continue to be legal tender.

<text>Charles Emory Smith (February 18, 1842 – January 19, 1908) was an American journalist and political leader.

==Early life==
Charles Emory Smith was born in Mansfield, Connecticut on February 18, 1842. In 1849 his family removed to Albany, New York, where he attended the public schools and The Albany Academy. He graduated from Union College in 1861, was a recruiting officer on the staff of General John F. Rathbone (1819–1901) in 1861-1862, taught in the Albany Academy in 1862-1865, and was editor of the &quot;Albany Express&quot; in 1865-1870. He joined the staff of the &quot;Albany Journal&quot; in 1870, and was editor-in-chief of this paper from 1876 to 1880. In 1879-1880 he was a regent of the University of the State of New York. From 1880 until his death he was editor and part proprietor of the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;.

==Career==
He was active as a Republican in state and national politics; was chairman of the Committee on Resolutions of the New York State Republican Conventions from 1874 to 1880 (excepting 1877), and was president of the convention of 1879; and was a delegate to several Republican National Conventions, drafting much of the Republican platforms of 1876 and 1896.

In 1890 to 1892 he was United States minister to Russia, and during that period had charge of distributing among the Russian famine sufferers five shiploads of food and other supplies, valued at an estimated $750,000. In November 1892, he gave a speech &quot;addressing the problem of immigration&quot; to the Patria Club. He expressed concern over the changing trends in immigration to the United States, and specifically called for the acceptance of Anglo-Saxon immigrants over Slavic immigrants.

He was Postmaster General in the cabinet of Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt from April 1898 until January 1902, and did much to develop the rural free delivery system.

He died at his home in Philadelphia on January 19, 1908. He is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd.

<text>A dynamometer car is a railroad maintenance of way car used for measuring various aspects of a locomotive&#x27;s performance. Measurements include tractive effort (pulling force), power, top speed, etc.

==History==
The first dynamometer car was probably one built in about 1838 by the &quot;Father of Computing&quot; Charles Babbage. Working for the Great Western Railway of Great Britain, he equipped a passenger carriage to be placed between an engine and train and record data on a continuously moving roll of paper. The recorded data included the pulling force of the engine, a plot of the path of the carriage and the vertical shake of the carriage. The work was undertaken to help support the position of the Great Western Railway in the controversy over standardizing the British track gauge.

In the United States, the Pennsylvania Railroad began using dynamometer cars in the 1860s. The first modern dynamometer car in the United States was built in 1874 by P. H. Dudley for the New York Central Railroad.

The early cars used a system of springs and mechanical linkages to effectively use the front coupler on the car as a scale and directly measure the force on the coupler. The car would also have a means to measure the speed of the train. Later versions used a hydraulic cylinder and line to transmit the force to the recording device.

Modern dynamometer cars typically use electronic solid state measuring devices and instrumentation such as strain gauges.

A LNER dynamometer car was used to record No 4468 Mallard&#x27;s speed record in 1938, and has been preserved at the National Railway Museum in York, England. This was also used for British Railways 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials along with two other dynamometer cars, both of which have also survived into preservation.

A car originally belonging to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, is preserved at the National Railroad Museum located in Green Bay, Wisconsin. A car built for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum.

== Usage ==
While the principal purpose of the dynamometer car was to measure the power output of locomotive, other data were typically collected, such as smoke box data, throttle settings and valve cut offs, fuel burn rates, and water usage to determine the overall performance and efficiency of the locomotive.

Data would typically be recorded on time-indexed continuous paper recording rolls for the pull and velocity. Power would later be manually calculated from these data on early cars. Some later cars were equipped with a mechanical integrator to directly record the power.

A separate use for the car was to test a particular rail route to rate it for tonnage based on a run with a dynamometer car and recording the effect of the grades and curvature on the capacity and resulting power requirements for that line.

== Power calculations ==
The operating principle of the dynamometer car is based on the basic equation for power being equal to force times distance over time.
:formula_1
This equation can be reduced to power equals force times velocity:
:formula_2
In other words, the instantaneous power output of the locomotive can be calculated by measuring the pull on the coupler and multiplying by the current speed.

:formula_3

Converting to horse power gives:

<doc id="1277590" wikidata="Q1640384" url="?curid=1277590" title="The Man with the Red Tattoo">
<text>The Man with the Red Tattoo, first published in 2002, was the sixth and final original novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming&#x27;s character James Bond. Carrying the Ian Fleming Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. It was later published in Japan in 2003. The novel&#x27;s working title was &quot;Red Widow Dawn&quot;.

After the publication of &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot;, Benson wrote the novelisation of &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, which was published later in the year. &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is considered Benson&#x27;s final James Bond novel, the following Bond stories being a series of novels about a teenage James Bond in the 1930s by Charlie Higson (see Young Bond), and a trilogy of faux-autobiographies by Samantha Weinberg entitled &quot;The Moneypenny Diaries&quot;, focusing on Miss Moneypenny. On 28 August 2005 Ian Fleming Publications confirmed that it was planning to publish a one-off adult Bond novel in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming&#x27;s birth. In July 2007 it was confirmed that the book had been completed by Sebastian Faulks, titled &quot;Devil May Care&quot;.

Benson at one time had plans to release a collection of short Bond stories, but after abruptly announcing his retirement in early 2003 from writing Bond novels, the project was never pursued. Not counting novelisations, &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot; marks the 35th original James Bond novel (including short story collections) since Ian Fleming introduced the character nearly 50 years earlier.

==Plot introduction==
On a flight from Japan to the United Kingdom, a young Japanese woman dies of a mysterious illness. The illness is a mutated version of the West Nile virus. James Bond finds out that not only was she the daughter of an important Japanese businessman, her entire family is also dead. James Bond travels to Japan in search of the killer. Here Bond reunites with his longtime friend Tiger Tanaka, who introduces him to a female Japanese agent who is later killed by the mutant virus.

<doc id="1277594" wikidata="Q807736" url="?curid=1277594" title="Facundo">
<text>Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism (original Spanish title: Facundo: Civilización y Barbarie) is a book written in 1845 by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, a writer and journalist who became the seventh president of Argentina. It is a cornerstone of Latin American literature: a work of creative non-fiction that helped to define the parameters for thinking about the region&#x27;s development, modernization, power, and culture. Subtitled &quot;Civilization and Barbarism&quot;, &quot;Facundo&quot; contrasts civilization and barbarism as seen in early 19th-century Argentina. Literary critic Roberto González Echevarría calls the work &quot;the most important book written by a Latin American in any discipline or genre&quot;.

&quot;Facundo&quot; describes the life of Juan Facundo Quiroga, a &quot;caudillo&quot; who had terrorized provincial Argentina in the 1820s and 1830s. Kathleen Ross, one of &quot;Facundo&quot;&#x27;s English translators, points out that the author also published &quot;Facundo&quot; to &quot;denounce the tyranny of the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas&quot;. Juan Manuel de Rosas ruled Argentina from 1829 to 1832 and again from 1835 to 1852; it was because of Rosas that Sarmiento was in exile in Chile, where he wrote the book. Sarmiento sees Rosas as heir to Facundo: both are &quot;caudillos&quot; and representatives of a barbarism that derives from the nature of the Argentine countryside. As Ross explains, Sarmiento&#x27;s book is therefore engaged in describing the &quot;Argentine national character, explaining the effects of Argentina&#x27;s geographical conditions on personality, the &#x27;barbaric&#x27; nature of the countryside versus the &#x27;civilizing&#x27; influence of the city, and the great future awaiting Argentina when it opened its doors wide to European immigration&quot;.

Throughout the text, Sarmiento explores the dichotomy between civilization and barbarism. As Kimberly Ball observes, &quot;civilization is identified with northern Europe, North America, cities, Unitarians, Paz, and Rivadavia&quot;, while &quot;barbarism is identified with Latin America, Spain, Asia, the Middle East, the countryside, Federalists, Facundo, and Rosas&quot;. It is in the way that &quot;Facundo&quot; articulates this opposition that Sarmiento&#x27;s book has had such a profound influence. In the words of González Echevarría: &quot;in proposing the dialectic between civilization and barbarism as the central conflict in Latin American culture &quot;Facundo&quot; gave shape to a polemic that began in the colonial period and continues to the present day&quot;.

The first edition of &quot;Facundo&quot; was published in installments in 1845. Sarmiento removed the last two chapters of the second edition (1851), but restored them in the 1874 edition, deciding that they were important to the book&#x27;s development.

The first translation into English, by Mary Tyler Peabody Mann, was published in 1868. A modern and complete translation by Kathleen Ross appeared in 2003 from the University of California Press.

==Background==

While exiled in Chile, Sarmiento wrote &quot;Facundo&quot; in 1845 as an attack on Juan Manuel de Rosas, the Argentine dictator at the time. The book was a critical analysis of Argentine culture as he saw it, represented in men such as Rosas and the regional leader Juan Facundo Quiroga, a warlord from La Rioja. For Sarmiento, Rosas and Quiroga were &quot;caudillos&quot;—strongmen who did not submit to the law. However, if Facundo&#x27;s portrait is linked to the wild nature of the countryside, Rosas is depicted as an opportunist who exploits the situation to perpetuate himself in power.

Sarmiento&#x27;s book is a critique and also a symptom of Argentina&#x27;s cultural conflicts. In 1810, the country had gained independence from the Spanish Empire, but Sarmiento complains that Argentina had yet to cohere as a unified entity. The country&#x27;s chief political division saw the Unitarists (or Unitarians, with whom Sarmiento sided), who favored centralization, counterposed against the Federalists, who believed that the regions should maintain a good measure of autonomy. This division was in part a split between the city and the countryside. Then as now, Buenos Aires was the country&#x27;s largest and wealthiest city as a result of its access to river trade routes and the South Atlantic. Buenos Aires was exposed not only to trade but to fresh ideas and European culture. These economic and cultural differences caused tension between Buenos Aires and the land-locked regions of the country. Despite his Unitarian sympathies, Sarmiento himself came from the provinces, a native of the Western town of San Juan.

===Argentine civil war===

Argentina&#x27;s divisions led to a civil war that began in 1814. A frail agreement was reached in the early 1820s, which led to the unification of the Republic just in time to wage the Cisplatine War against the Empire of Brazil, but the relations between the Provinces reached again the point of breaking-off in 1826, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia was elected president and tried to enforce a newly enacted centralist Constitution. Supporters of decentralized government challenged the Unitarist Party, leading to the outbreak of violence. Federalists Juan Facundo Quiroga and Manuel Dorrego wanted more autonomy for the provinces and were inclined to reject European culture. The Unitarists defended Rivadavia&#x27;s presidency, as it created educational opportunities for rural inhabitants through a European-staffed university program. However, under Rivadavia&#x27;s rule, the salaries of common laborers were subjected to government wage ceilings, and the &quot;gauchos&quot; (&quot;cattle-wrangling horsemen of the pampas&quot;) were either imprisoned or forced to work without pay.

A series of governors were installed and replaced beginning in 1828 with the appointment of Federalist Manuel Dorrego as the governor of Buenos Aires. However, Dorrego&#x27;s government was very soon overthrown and replaced by that of Unitarist Juan Lavalle. Lavalle&#x27;s rule ended when he was defeated by a militia of &quot;gauchos&quot; led by Rosas. By the end of 1829, the legislature had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires. Under Rosas&#x27;s rule, many intellectuals fled either to Chile, as did Sarmiento, or to Uruguay, as Sarmiento himself notes.

===Juan Manuel de Rosas===
According to Latin American historian John Lynch, Juan Manuel de Rosas was &quot;a landowner, a rural &quot;caudillo&quot;, and the dictator of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1852&quot;. He was born into a wealthy family of high social status, but Rosas&#x27;s strict upbringing had a deep psychological influence on him. Sarmiento asserts that because of Rosas&#x27;s mother, &quot;the spectacle of authority and servitude must have left lasting impressions on him&quot;. Shortly after reaching puberty, Rosas was sent to an &quot;estancia&quot; and stayed there for about thirty years. In time, he learned how to manage the ranch and he established an authoritarian government in the area. While in power, Rosas incarcerated residents for unspecified reasons, acts which Sarmiento argues were similar to Rosas&#x27;s treatment of cattle. Sarmiento argues that this was one method of making his citizens like the &quot;tamest, most orderly cattle known&quot;.

Juan Manuel de Rosas&#x27;s first term as governor lasted only three years. His rule, assisted by Juan Facundo Quiroga and Estanislao López, was respected and he was praised for his ability to maintain harmony between Buenos Aires and the rural areas. The country fell into disorder after Rosas&#x27;s resignation in 1832, and in 1835 he was once again called to lead the country. He ruled the country not as he did during his first term as governor, but as a dictator, forcing all citizens to support his Federalist regime. According to Nicolas Shumway, Rosas &quot;forced the citizens to wear the red Federalist insignia, and his picture appeared in all public places...  Rosas&#x27;s enemies, real and imagined, were increasingly imprisoned, tortured, murdered, or driven into exile by the &quot;mazorca&quot;, a band of spies and thugs supervised personally by Rosas. Publications were censored, and &quot;porteño&quot; newspapers became tedious apologizers for the regime&quot;.

=== Domingo Faustino Sarmiento ===
In &quot;Facundo&quot;, Sarmiento is both the narrator and a main character. The book contains autobiographical elements from Sarmiento&#x27;s life, and he comments on the entire Argentine circumstance. He also expresses and analyzes his own opinion and chronicles some historic events. Within the book&#x27;s dichotomy between civilization and barbarism, Sarmiento&#x27;s character represents civilization, steeped as he is in European and North American ideas; he stands for education and development, as opposed to Rosas and Facundo, who symbolize barbarism.

Sarmiento was an educator, a civilized man who was a militant adherent to the Unitarist movement. During the Argentine civil war he fought against Facundo several times, and while in Spain he became a member of the Literary Society of Professors. Exiled to Chile by Rosas when he started to write &quot;Facundo&quot;, Sarmiento would later return as a politician. He was a member of the Senate after Rosas&#x27;s fall and president of Argentina for six years (1868–1874). During his presidency, Sarmiento concentrated on migration, sciences, and culture. His ideas were based on European civilization; for him, the development of a country was rooted in education. To this end, he founded Argentina&#x27;s military and naval colleges.

== Synopsis ==

After a lengthy introduction, &quot;Facundo&quot;&#x27;s fifteen chapters divide broadly into three sections: chapters one to four outline Argentine geography, anthropology, and history; chapters five to fourteen recount the life of Juan Facundo Quiroga; and the concluding chapter expounds Sarmiento&#x27;s vision of a future for Argentina under a Unitarist government. In Sarmiento&#x27;s words, the reason why he chose to provide Argentine context and use Facundo Quiroga to condemn Rosas&#x27;s dictatorship is that &quot;in Facundo Quiroga I do not only see simply a caudillo, but rather a manifestation of Argentine life as it has been made by colonization and the peculiarities of the land&quot;.

===Argentine context===
&quot;Facundo&quot; begins with a geographical description of Argentina, from the Andes in the west to the eastern Atlantic coast, where two main river systems converge at the boundary between Argentina and Uruguay. This river estuary, called the Rio de Plata, is the location of Buenos Aires, the capital. Through his discussion of Argentina&#x27;s geography, Sarmiento demonstrates Buenos Aires&#x27; advantages; the river systems were communications arteries which, by enabling trade, helped the city to achieve civilization. Buenos Aires failed to spread civilization to the rural areas and as a result, much of the rest of Argentina was doomed to barbarism. Sarmiento also argues that the &quot;pampas&quot;, Argentina&#x27;s wide and empty plains, provided &quot;no place for people to escape and hide for defense and this prohibits civilization in most parts of Argentina&quot;. Despite the barriers to civilization caused by Argentina&#x27;s geography, Sarmiento argues that many of the country&#x27;s problems were caused by &quot;gauchos&quot; like Juan Manuel de Rosas, who were barbaric, uneducated, ignorant, and arrogant; their character prevented Argentine society&#x27;s progress toward civilization. Sarmiento then describes the four main types of &quot;gaucho&quot; and these characterizations aid in understanding Argentine leaders, such as Juan Manuel de Rosas. Sarmiento argues that without an understanding of these Argentine character types, &quot;it is impossible to understand our political personages, or the primordial, American character of the bloody struggle that tears apart the Argentine Republic&quot;.

Sarmiento then moves on to the Argentine peasants, who are &quot;independent of all need, free of all subjection, with no idea of government&quot;. The peasants gather at taverns, where they spend their time drinking and gambling. They display their eagerness to prove their physical strength with horsemanship and knife fights. Rarely these displays led to deaths, and Sarmiento notes that Rosas&#x27;s residence was sometimes used as a refuge on such occasions, before he became politically powerful.

According to Sarmiento, these elements are crucial to an understanding of the Argentine Revolution, in which Argentina gained independence from Spain. Although Argentina&#x27;s war of independence was prompted by the influence of European ideas, Buenos Aires was the only city that could achieve civilization. Rural people participated in the war to demonstrate their physical strengths rather than because they wanted to civilize the country. In the end, the revolution was a failure because the barbaric instincts of the rural population led to the loss and dishonor of the civilized city—Buenos Aires.

===Life of Juan Facundo Quiroga===
 As the central character of Sarmiento&#x27;s &quot;Facundo&quot;, he represents barbarism, the antithesis of civilization. (Portrait by Fernando García del Molino) The second section of &quot;Facundo&quot; explores the life of its titular character, Juan Facundo Quiroga—the &quot;Tiger of the Plains&quot;. Despite being born into a wealthy family, Facundo received only a basic education in reading and writing. He loved gambling, being called &quot;el jugador&quot; (the player)—in fact, Sarmiento describes his gambling as &quot;an ardent passion burning in his belly&quot;. As a youth Facundo was antisocial and rebellious, refusing to mix with other children, and these traits became more pronounced as he matured. Sarmiento describes an incident in which Facundo killed a man, writing that this type of behaviour &quot;marked his passage through the world&quot;. Sarmiento gives a physical description of the man he considers to personify the &quot;caudillo&quot;: &quot;[he had a] short and well built stature; his broad shoulders supported, on a short neck, a well-formed head covered with very thick, black and curly hair&quot;, with &quot;eyes ... full of fire&quot;.

Facundo&#x27;s relations with his family eventually broke down, and, taking on the life of a &quot;gaucho&quot;, he joined the &quot;caudillos&quot; in the province of Entre Ríos. His killing of two royalist prisoners after a jailbreak saw him acclaimed as a hero among the &quot;gauchos&quot;, and on relocating to La Rioja, Facundo was appointed to a leadership position in the Llanos Militia. He built his reputation and won his comrades&#x27; respect through his fierce battlefield performances, but hated and tried to destroy those who differed from him by being civilized and well-educated.

In 1825, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia became the governor of the Buenos Aires province, he held a meeting with representatives from all provinces in Argentina. Facundo was present as the governor of La Rioja. Rivadavia was soon overthrown, and Manuel Dorrego became the new governor. Sarmiento contends that Dorrego, a Federalist, was interested neither in social progress nor in ending barbaric behaviour in Argentina by improving the level of civilization and education of its rural inhabitants. In the turmoil that characterized Argentine politics at the time, Dorrego was assassinated by Unitarists and Facundo was defeated by Unitarist General José María Paz. Facundo escaped to Buenos Aires and joined the Federalist government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. During the ensuing civil war between the two ideologies, Facundo conquered the provinces of San Luis, Cordoba and Mendoza.

On return to his San Juan home, which Sarmiento says Facundo governed &quot;solely with his terrifying name&quot;, he realized that his government lacked support from Rosas. He went to Buenos Aires to confront Rosas, who sent him on another political mission. On his way back, Facundo was shot and killed at Barranca Yaco, Córdoba. According to Sarmiento, the murder was plotted by Rosas: &quot;An impartial history still awaits facts and revelations, in order to point its finger at the instigator of the assassins&quot;.

===Consequences of Facundo&#x27;s death===

In the book&#x27;s final chapters, Sarmiento explores the consequences of Facundo&#x27;s death for the history and politics of the Argentine Republic. He further analyzes Rosas&#x27;s government and personality, commenting on dictatorship, tyranny, the role of popular support, and the use of force to maintain order. Sarmiento criticizes Rosas by using the words of the dictator, making sarcastic remarks about Rosas&#x27;s actions, and describing the &quot;terror&quot; established during the dictatorship, the contradictions of the government, and the situation in the provinces that were ruled by Facundo. Sarmiento writes, &quot;The red ribbon is a materialization of the terror that accompanies you everywhere, in the streets, in the bosom of the family; it must be thought about when dressing, when undressing, and ideas are always engraved upon us by association&quot;.

Finally, Sarmiento examines the legacy of Rosas&#x27;s government by attacking the dictator and widening the civilization–barbarism dichotomy. By setting France against Argentina—representing civilization and barbarism respectively—Sarmiento contrasts culture and savagery:

France&#x27;s blockade had lasted for two years, and the &#x27;American&#x27; government, inspired by &#x27;American&#x27; spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social results of the French blockade, however, had been fruitful for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate in all their nakedness the current state of mind and the new elements of struggle, which were to ignite a fierce war that can end only with the fall of that monstrous government.

== Genre and style ==
Spanish critic and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno comments of the book, &quot;I never took &quot;Facundo&quot; by Sarmiento as a historical work, nor do I think it can be very valued in that regard. I always thought of it as a literary work, as a historical novel&quot;. However, &quot;Facundo&quot; cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an &quot;essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [and] travelogue&quot;. Sarmiento&#x27;s style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina&#x27;s geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.

The book is partly fictional, as well: Sarmiento draws on his imagination in addition to historical fact in describing Rosas. In &quot;Facundo&quot;, Sarmiento outlines his argument that Rosas&#x27;s dictatorship is the main cause of Argentina&#x27;s problems. The themes of barbarism and savagery that run through the book are, to Sarmiento, consequences of Rosas&#x27;s dictatorial government. To make his case, Sarmiento often has recourse to strategies drawn from literature.

== Themes ==

=== Civilization and barbarism ===

&quot;Facundo&quot; is not only a critique of Rosas&#x27;s dictatorship, but a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture, which Sarmiento charts through the rise, controversial rule, and downfall of Juan Facundo Quiroga, an archetypical Argentine &quot;caudillo&quot;. Sarmiento summarizes the book&#x27;s message in the phrase &quot;That is the point: to be or not to be savages&quot;. The dichotomy between civilization and barbarism is the book&#x27;s central idea; Facundo Quiroga is portrayed as wild, untamed, and standing opposed to true progress through his rejection of European cultural ideals—found at that time in the metropolitan society of Buenos Aires.

The conflict between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America&#x27;s difficulties in the post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento was not the first to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a &quot;caudillo&quot; culture of brutality and absolute power. &quot;Facundo&quot; set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas of European and Classical origin, for him education was the key.
&quot;Caudillos&quot; like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the beginning of the book, as the antithesis of education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills. They are the agents of instability and chaos, destroying societies through their blatant disregard for humanity and social progress.

If Sarmiento viewed himself as civilized, Rosas was barbaric. Historian David Rock argues that &quot;contemporary opponents reviled Rosas as a bloody tyrant and a symbol of barbarism&quot;. Sarmiento attacked Rosas through his book by promoting education and &quot;civilized&quot; status, whereas Rosas used political power and brute force to dispose of any kind of hindrance. In linking Europe with civilization, and civilization with education, Sarmiento conveyed an admiration of European culture and civilization which at the same time gave him a sense of dissatisfaction with his own culture, motivating him to drive it towards civilization.
Using the wilderness of the &quot;pampas&quot; to reinforce his social analysis, he characterizes those who were isolated and opposed to political dialogue as ignorant and anarchic—symbolized by Argentina&#x27;s desolate physical geography. Conversely, Latin America was connected to barbarism, which Sarmiento used mainly to illustrate the way in which Argentina was disconnected from the numerous resources surrounding it, limiting the growth of the country.

American critic Doris Sommer sees a connection between &quot;Facundo&quot;&#x27;s ideology and Sarmiento&#x27;s readings of Fenimore Cooper. She links Sarmiento&#x27;s remarks on modernization and culture to the American discourse of expansion and progress of the 19th century.

=== Writing and power ===

In the history of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been relatively common—examples range from Paraguay&#x27;s José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile&#x27;s Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American literature has been distinguished by the protest novel, or dictator novel; the main story is based around the dictator figure, his behaviour, characteristics and the situation of the people under his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the written word in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a weapon against repression.

Making use of the connection between writing and power was one of Sarmiento&#x27;s strategies. For him, writing was intended to be a catalyst for action. While the &quot;gauchos&quot; fought with physical weapons, Sarmiento used his voice and language. Sorensen states that Sarmiento used &quot;text as [a] weapon&quot;. Sarmiento was writing not only for Argentina but for a wider audience too, especially the United States and Europe; in his view, these regions were close to civilization; his purpose was to seduce his readers toward his own political viewpoint. In the numerous translations of &quot;Facundo&quot;, Sarmiento&#x27;s association of writing with power and conquest is apparent.

Since his books often serve as vehicles for his political manifesto, Sarmiento&#x27;s writings commonly mock governments, with &quot;Facundo&quot; being the most prominent example. He elevates his own status at the expense of the ruling elite, almost portraying himself as invincible due to the power of writing. Toward the end of 1840, Sarmiento was exiled for his political views. Covered with bruises received the day before from unruly soldiers, he wrote in French, &quot;On ne tue point les idees&quot; (misquoted from &quot;on ne tire pas des coups de fusil aux idees&quot;, which means &quot;ideas cannot be killed by guns&quot;). The government decided to decipher the message, and on learning the translation, said, &quot;So! What does this mean?&quot;. With the failure of his oppressors to understand his meaning, Sarmiento is able to illustrate their ineptitude. His words are presented as a &quot;code&quot; that needs to be &quot;deciphered&quot;, and unlike Sarmiento those in power are barbaric and uneducated. Their bafflement not only demonstrates their general ignorance, but also, according to Sorensen, illustrates &quot;the fundamental displacement which any cultural transplantation brings about&quot;, since Argentine rural inhabitants and Rosas&#x27;s associates were unable to accept the civilized culture which Sarmiento believed would lead to progress in Argentina.

== Legacy ==
For translator Kathleen Ross, &quot;Facundo&quot; is &quot;one of the foundational works of Spanish American literary history&quot;. It has been enormously influential in setting out a &quot;blueprint for modernization&quot;, with its practical message enhanced by a &quot;tremendous beauty and passion&quot;. However, according to literary critic González Echevarría it is not only a powerful founding text but &quot;the first Latin American classic, and the most important book written about Latin America by a Latin American in any discipline or genre&quot;. The book&#x27;s political influence can be seen in Sarmiento&#x27;s eventual rise to power. He became president of Argentina in 1868 and was able to apply his theories to ensure that his nation achieved civilization. Although Sarmiento wrote several books, he viewed &quot;Facundo&quot; as authorizing his political views.

According to Sorensen, &quot;early readers of &quot;Facundo&quot; were deeply influenced by the struggles that preceded and followed Rosas&#x27;s dictatorship, and their views sprang from their relationship to the strife for interpretive and political hegemony&quot;. González Echevarría notes that &quot;Facundo&quot; provided the impetus for other writers to examine dictatorship in Latin America, and contends that it is still read today because Sarmiento created &quot;a voice for modern Latin American authors&quot;. The reason for this, according to González Echevarría, is that &quot;Latin American authors struggle with its legacy, rewriting &quot;Facundo&quot; in their works even as they try to untangle themselves from its discourse&quot;. Subsequent dictator novels, such as &quot;El Señor Presidente&quot; by Miguel Ángel Asturias or &quot;The Feast of the Goat&quot; by Mario Vargas Llosa, drew upon its ideas, and a knowledge of &quot;Facundo&quot; enhances the reader&#x27;s understanding of these later books.

One irony of the impact of Sarmiento&#x27;s essay genre and fictional literature is that, according to González Echevarría, the &quot;gaucho&quot; has become &quot;an object of nostalgia, a lost origin around which to build a national mythology&quot;. While Sarmiento was trying to eliminate the &quot;gaucho&quot;, he also transformed him into a &quot;national symbol&quot;. González Echevarría further argues that Juan Facundo Quiroga also continues to exist, since he represents &quot;our unresolved struggle between good and evil, and our lives&#x27; inexorable drive toward death&quot;. According to translator Kathleen Ross, &quot;&quot;Facundo&quot; continues to inspire controversy and debate because it contributes to national myths of modernization, anti-populism, and racist ideology&quot;.

==Publication and translation history==
The first edition of &quot;Facundo&quot; was published in instalments in 1845, in the literary supplement of the Chilean newspaper &quot;El Progreso&quot;. The second edition, also published in Chile (in 1851), contained significant alterations—Sarmiento removed the last two chapters on the advice of Valentín Alsina, an exiled Argentinian lawyer and politician. However, the missing sections reappeared in 1874 in a later edition, because Sarmiento saw them as crucial to the book&#x27;s development.

&quot;Facundo&quot; was first translated in 1868, by Mary Mann, a friend of Sarmiento, with the title &quot;Life in the Argentine Republic in the Days of the Tyrants; or, Civilization and Barbarism&quot;. More recently, Kathleen Ross has undertaken a modern and complete translation, published in 2003 by the University of California Press. In Ross&#x27;s &quot;Translator&#x27;s Introduction,&quot; she notes that Mann&#x27;s 19th-century version of the text was influenced by Mann&#x27;s friendship with Sarmiento and by the fact that he was at the time a candidate in the Argentine presidential election: &quot;Mann wished to further her friend&#x27;s cause abroad by presenting Sarmiento as an admirer and emulator of United States political and cultural institutions&quot;. Hence Mann&#x27;s translation cut much of what made Sarmiento&#x27;s work distinctively part of the Hispanic tradition. Ross continues: &quot;Mann&#x27;s elimination of metaphor, the stylistic device perhaps most characteristic of Sarmiento&#x27;s prose, is especially striking&quot;.

<doc id="1277597" wikidata="Q163930" url="?curid=1277597" title="Stapelia">
<text>Stapelia is a genus of low-growing, spineless, stem succulent plants, predominantly from South Africa with a few from other parts of Africa. Several Asian and Latin American species were formerly included but they have all now been transferred to other genera. The flowers of certain species, most notably &quot;Stapelia gigantea&quot;, can reach 41 cm (16 inches) in diameter when fully open. Most &quot;Stapelia&quot; flowers are visibly hairy and generate the odor of rotten flesh when they bloom.

== Description ==
The hairy, oddly textured and coloured appearance of many &quot;Stapelia&quot; flowers has been claimed to resemble that of rotting meat, and this, coupled with their odour, has earned the most commonly grown members of the genus &quot;Stapelia&quot; the common name of carrion flowers.
A notable exception is the sweetly scented &quot;Stapelia flavopurpurea&quot;. Such odours serve to attract various specialist pollinators including, in the case of carrion-scented blooms, blow flies of the dipteran family Calliphoridae. They frequently lay eggs around the coronae of &quot;Stapelia&quot; flowers, convinced by the plants&#x27; deception.

== Cultivation ==
A handful of species are commonly cultivated as pot plants and are even used as rockery plants in countries where the climate permits. &quot;Stapelia&quot; are good container plants and can grow well under full sun and light to moderate watering. They should be planted in well-drained compost as the stems are prone to rotting if kept moist for long.

== Species ==
32 species are accepted:
;Unplaced names
* &quot;Stapelia × dejecta&quot; 
* &quot;Stapelia fuscopurpurea&quot; 
* &quot;Stapelia × massonii&quot; 
* &quot;Stapelia × multiflora&quot; 
* &quot;Stapelia × multiflora&quot; 
* &quot;Stapelia × plantii&quot; 

;Species formerly included
now transferred to other genera &quot;(Angolluma, Brachystelma, Caralluma, Duvalia, Echidnopsis, Gonolobus, Hoodia, Hoya, Huernia, Monolluma, Orbea, Orbeopsis, Pachycymbium, Piaranthus, Quaqua, Stapelianthus, Tromotriche, Tridentea, Triplosperma)&quot;

<text>Bürgersinn (Citizen Spirit) op. 295 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1865 for the Citizen&#x27;s Ball held during the Vienna Carnival Fasching of the year. His prestigious post of the &#x27;KK Hofballmusikdirektor&#x27;, which he attained in 1863, meant that his responsibilities included composing dance music for these functions.

This annual Citizen&#x27;s Ball was held every year, especially for the middle-class as Emperor Franz Josef permitted the traditional ball to be held in the festive hall of the Habsburg&#x27;s winter residence. Strauss first performed the work at the Redoutensaal of the Imperial Hofburg dedicated to the &#x27;Gentlemen Committee of the Members of the Citizen&#x27;s Ball&#x27; on 7 February 1865.

The work belongs to a period where Strauss&#x27; waltzes were in a period of interesting development, both structurally as well as musically. The citizen spirit was vividly invoked with its Viennese light-heartedness, but more so with its gentle pastoral Introduction where anticipation of an exciting waltz was at hand. Even the first theme of the waltz was quintessentially Viennese with its chorded melody. Other tunes were graceful and lyrical (sections 2 and 3) whereas the later melodies (sections 4 and 5) are more energetic and jovial in character.

<doc id="1277603" wikidata="Q1044544" url="?curid=1277603" title="Mitsubishi Outlander">
<text>The is a compact crossover SUV manufactured by Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors since 2001. It was originally known as the when it was introduced in Japan.

The original Airtrek name was chosen to &quot;describe the vehicle&#x27;s ability to transport its passengers on adventure-packed journeys in a &#x27;free-as-a-bird&#x27; manner&quot;, and was &quot;coined from &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Trek&quot; to express the idea of footloose, adventure-filled motoring pleasure.&quot; The Outlander nameplate which replaced it evoked a &quot;feeling of journeying to distant, unexplored lands in search of adventure.&quot;

The second generation of the vehicle was introduced in 2006 and all markets including Japan adopted the Outlander name, although production of the older version continued in parallel. It was built on the company&#x27;s GS platform, and used various engines developed by Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, and PSA Peugeot Citroën. PSA&#x27;s Citroën C-Crosser and Peugeot 4007, which were manufactured by Mitsubishi in Japan, are badge engineered versions of the second generation Outlander. Global sales achieved the 1.5 million unit milestone in October 2016, 15 years after its market launch.

As part of the third generation line-up, Mitsubishi launched in January 2013 a plug-in hybrid model called Outlander PHEV. , global sales totaled about 300,000 units.

The fourth-generation model was released in 2021 as a 2022 model. Following Mitsubishi&#x27;s entry to Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, the fourth-generation Outlander is based on the Rogue/X-Trail, which is built on the CMF-CD platform.

== First generation (CU/ZE/ZF; 2001) ==

The first-generation Outlander/Airtrek was based on the Mitsubishi ASX concept vehicle exhibited at the 2001 North American International Auto Show. The ASX (Active Sports Crossover) represented Mitsubishi&#x27;s approach to the industry wide crossover SUV trend for retaining the all-season and off-road abilities offered by a high ground clearance and four-wheel drive, while still offering car-like levels of emissions, economy, and size.

The Airtrek was first introduced to the Japanese market on 20 June 2001, and was sold at Mitsubishi Japan dealership chain called &quot;Car Plaza&quot;. It offered a choice of either a &quot;4G63&quot; 2.0 L or a &quot;4G64&quot; 2.4 L GDI, mated to a standard &quot;INVECS-II&quot; 4-speed automatic transmission. Both front- and four-wheel drive were available. The four-wheel drive version uses open differentials for the front and rear axles, with a viscous coupling unit for the center differential. A performance-oriented model, called the Turbo-R, was introduced in 2002 and used a detuned version of the Lancer Evolution&#x27;s &quot;4G63T&quot; 2.0 L I4 turbo. The engine produced and , although in export markets the Outlander version&#x27;s output was reduced to and . The availability of four-cylinder engines under 2.0 liters offered Japanese buyers a vehicle that was in compliance with Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, however, the exterior dimensions exceed Japanese regulations for the &quot;compact&quot; designation.

The Outlander arrived in 2003 in North America, replacing the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, with a modified front grille and headlights which increased the overall length by approximately , and the two models were manufactured in parallel thereafter. It shared its platform with the Mitsubishi Grandis, also introduced in 2003. A version of the &quot;4G64&quot; powerplant was offered first, while a &quot;4G69&quot; 2.4 L SOHC MIVEC I4 producing and , and the turbocharged &quot;4G63T&quot; appeared in 2004. All had the option of front- or four-wheel drive.

In several South American markets it was known as the Montero Outlander, to benefit from an association with the strong-selling Mitsubishi Montero Sport.

=== Mitsubishi Airtrek ===


== Second generation (CW/ZG/ZH; 2006) ==

On 17 October 2005, Mitsubishi launched the second generation model, dropping the &quot;Airtrek&quot; in Japan in favour of adopting the global name. It features a new DOHC 2.4 L 16-valve MIVEC engine; &quot;INVECS-III&quot; continuously variable transmission (CVT), Mitsubishi&#x27;s AWC system which features electronically controlled four-wheel-drive and stability control, on a stretched Mitsubishi GS platform. The North American version, powered by a newly designed &quot;6B31&quot; 3.0 L V6 SOHC MIVEC was shown in April 2006 at the New York International Auto Show prior to its release in October the same year. Due to the availability of a V6 engine, Mitsubishi returned to offering a shorter version of this vehicle and reintroduced the Mitsubishi RVR on 17 February 2010. The usage of a four-cylinder engine under 2.0 liters offers Japanese buyers a vehicle that was in compliance with Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, which has tax advantages, giving buyers the ability to purchase a vehicle capable of seating seven people without paying the tax penalty of a larger engine.

The second generation Outlander went on sale in Europe in February 2007, and this time included a diesel engine – essential in the European market at the time. Mitsubishi chose to purchase Volkswagen&#x27;s 2.0-litre &quot;Pumpe-Düse&quot; unit with , as also installed in the European market Grandis. Before this even went on sale, Mitsubishi had decided that there was a need for a more powerful diesel option and by November 2007 higher end diesel models received PSA&#x27;s 2.2-liter DW12 common rail diesel with . Both diesels were labelled &quot;Di-D&quot; by Mitsubishi. In September 2010 Mitsubishi&#x27;s own 2.3-liter 4N14 diesel engine with was introduced while the Volkswagen engine was discontinued. The PSA unit continued to be available in certain countries.

The Outlander, which features Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;RISE&quot; safety body, received a four-star rating from the Euro NCAP car safety performance assessment programme. One of its unique features is something Mitsubishi calls a &quot;Flap-Fold Tailgate&quot;; it is a two-piece tailgate integrated into the rear bumper that folds down for easy loading, while serving as a bench when the tailgate is open, able to accommodate up to .

In the Philippines, the second generation Outlander was released in 2007. It was offered in 2 grades; the entry-level GLS and the top-spec GLS Sport. The GLS grade is powered by a 2.4L MIVEC inline-four engine, while the GLS Sport is powered by a 3.0L V6 engine both paired to a INVECS-III CVT with 6-speed sportronic mode and multi-select 4WD system.

In 2009, the GLX grade was added to the lineup, powered by the same 2.4L inline-four engine as the GLS.

In its home market of Japan it was the best-selling SUV from October 2006 to March 2007, while in the U.S. market it achieved 1,694 and 2,108 sales in November and December 2006, the first two full months it was available; Mitsubishi hoped for at least 4,000 sales per month in the United States. In Chile, where both generations were on sale simultaneously, the new model was badged Outlander K2.

Increased demand for the Lancer, and the consequent effects on the capacity of the company&#x27;s Mizushima production facility, have obliged Mitsubishi to reassess production of the Outlander. In September 2007, they announced that from 2008, production of European market Outlanders would be transferred from Nagoya to its NedCar plant in the Netherlands, while the Citroën C-Crosser and Peugeot 4007 would have their production transferred from Mizushima to Nagoya.

The model was facelifted for the 2008 model year, although the 2007 grille carried over in the United States and Canada for 2008-09 until another facelift in the 2010 model year.

At the 2007 SEMA Show in Las Vegas, the company displayed a Mitsubishi Evolander (now known as Mitsubishi Outlander Ralliart) concept, powered by a supercharged version of the vehicle&#x27;s &quot;6B31&quot; V6 engine and equipped with suitably uprated suspension, brakes, wheels/tires, body kit and interior. A second show car, an Outlander GT Prototype with a front grille based on the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, was exhibited at the 2009 New York International Auto Show, and formed the basis of the facelifted model introduced in late 2009.

Along with a major facelift for the 2010 model year, the top end Outlander XLS (GT in the US) introduced a new colour multi-function display and the Mitsubishi S-AWC AWD system. The lower trims retain the previous MFD and the less advanced AWC AWD system. Likewise, the interior was also slightly revised to incorporate leather into the dashboard trim and doors.

== Third generation (GF/GG/ZJ/ZK/ZL; 2012) ==

Mitsubishi unveiled the third-generation Outlander at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The production version of the Outlander was debuted in Russia in July 2012, and was introduced in other European markets in September 2012. While the new vehicle was introduced to North America at the November 2012 LA Auto Show it was not available for purchase until early 2014. North American Outlanders continued on the second-generation platform through model year 2013. However, the third generation Outlander are not sold in the Philippine market due to poor sales, in favor of the third-row Mitsubishi Montero Sport.

The redesigned model has a new lightweight body that weighs approximately less than the previous model due to extensive use of high tensile strength steel. With a lower drag coefficient of cd 0.33, fuel economy has been improved over the previous model. Inside, the dashboard and front doors are covered with soft touch material, the seats are redesigned, and there is good sound insulation.

The front suspension consists of MacPherson struts with a stabilizer bar, and the rear suspension is a multi-link design with a stabilizer bar. Electric Power Steering reduces load on the engine compared to a hydraulic system and helps to improve fuel economy. Disc brakes are installed on all four wheels, with vented rotors in front along with solid rotors in back.

Newly available safety features include a Forward Collision Mitigation system, a Lane departure warning system, a driver knee airbag to reduce leg injury in a crash, and adaptive cruise control. In addition, the Outlander has standard driver and passenger front airbags, front side torso airbags along with curtain airbags, ABS with EBD, Traction Control Logic, Active Stability Control, Hill Start Assist, and a brake pedal that recedes to prevent leg injury in a crash.

In crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Outlander received a top score of &quot;Good&quot; in every category. When equipped with the optional Forward Collision Mitigation system, the car received the Institute&#x27;s Top Safety Pick+ award. The vehicle also received full five star overall ratings in the United States, Japanese, and European New Car Assessment Programs.

=== Second facelift ===
At the 2015 New York International Auto Show, Mitsubishi debuted a heavily revised Outlander for the 2016 model year. The vehicle features new design language called &quot;Dynamic Shield&quot; that will be the basis for future vehicles in different segments. The revised headlights now include LED DRLs with the option of full LED headlights. Inside the cabin, Mitsubishi made refinements to the steering wheel, headliner, rear folding seats, and door controls.

Besides cosmetic changes, the updated Outlander has somewhat reduced cabin noise via increased use of sound insulation, thicker door glass, dynamic suspension and differential dampers, and thicker weatherstripping. The suspension and steering are re-tuned and a new generation Jatco CVT8 transmission introduced for four-cylinder models. The revised SUV first went on sale in Russia in April 2015, followed by the Australia in June and Canada and the Caribbean in July.

===Third facelift===
The Outlander received another facelift for the 2019 model year. Changes included a new twin blade grille that contains black inserts, revised front and rear bumper design, and new 18-inch alloy wheels.

=== Outlander PHEV ===
The third generation includes a plug-in hybrid variant, called PHEV, and its production version was unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. According to JATO Dynamics, the Outlander PHEV was once the world&#x27;s all-time best selling plug-in hybrid since December 2018.

==== Specifications ====

The plug-in hybrid has a 2.0-litre 4-cylinder MIVEC petrol engine, coupled with an electric powertrain, derived from the electric systems used on the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, it produces a combined . Two 60 kW electric motors independently power the front and rear wheels, while the petrol-powered engine can be used as a generator for the motors, and/or power the vehicle directly. The combustion engine can only send power to the front wheels as there is no driveshaft linking it to the rear wheels. Located on the left side of the engine (positioned transaxle-style), the front motor is a smaller, lighter, and higher output version of the permanent magnet synchronous electric motor used in the i-MiEV.

The Outlander PHEV has a 12 kWh lithium-ion battery pack capable of delivering an all-electric range of under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the Japanese JC08 test the all-electric range is , with a top speed of . The battery pack is located in a dust- and waterproof encasement positioned beneath the passenger compartment subfloor and between the front and rear axles, with no intrusion into the passenger compartment. It consists of 80 cells configured in series. Mitsubishi&#x27;s target was to achieve a combined fuel economy for Japan in &quot;EV Drive&quot; mode of 67 km/L equivalent, or equivalent to about 157 miles per U.S. gallon (MPGe). Fuel economy in hybrid mode for Japan is .

The plug-in hybrid comes equipped with two charging sockets, regular and quick charging CHAdeMO. When charging at home the driver can choose between a standard 3-pin plug socket or via a dedicated EV charging point. From a standard plug, charging from empty to full charge takes about five hours. From a dedicated charging point at home or at a public charging point, it takes about 3.5 hours for a full charge. The DC rapid charging socket can be used at CHAdeMO charging stations. Rapid charging allows for an 80% charge in approximately 25 minutes.

The Outlander PHEV features three driver-activated modes, which are ECO Mode, Battery Save Mode and Battery Charge Mode, along with three driving modes: &quot;EV Drive&quot;, &quot;Series Hybrid&quot;, and &quot;Parallel Hybrid&quot;. It also features regenerative braking during normal deceleration (braking or coasting), with the front and rear electric motors working as generators so that electricity can be generated and fed back into the main battery pack. In addition, the plug-in hybrid has a set-up that allows the driver to control the strength of the engine braking with paddles behind the steering wheel. The driver switches on regenerative braking either by sliding the central selector to the &quot;B&quot; position, or by operating the paddles.

The 2019 model Outlander has a 13.8 kWh battery, which increases the range to and the top speed to .

==== Sales ====
Sales began in Japan by late January 2013, becoming the first SUV plug-in hybrid in the market.

The European version was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The European version is similar to the Japanese model except for minor adjustments to comply with EU requirements, and Mitsubishi expected an emission rating of 44 g/km. Retail deliveries began in Europe in October 2013, beginning in the Netherlands and followed by the Nordic countries, Sales in Australia were originally scheduled for June 2013, but began only in 2014.

The introduction in the United States was initially scheduled for January 2014, but was delayed. Due to California&#x27;s regulations that require a battery-monitoring unit (BMU), Mitsubishi delayed the market launch in the U.S. to mid-2017 as model year 2017. The BMU conducts onboard diagnosis of the Outlander&#x27;s lithium-ion battery capacity and output, and it alerts the driver to possible degradation, which might affect the vehicle&#x27;s emissions.

The Outlander PHEV ranked as the world&#x27;s top selling plug-in hybrid in 2014, and also as the third best-selling plug-in electric car after the all-electrics Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf. Global sales totaled about 42,400 units in 2015, representing 24.6% of worldwide sales of the Outlander lineup, making the plug-in hybrid for a second year in a row the world&#x27;s best-selling plug-in hybrid, and also the third top selling plug-in electric car.

The Outlander PHEV ranked in 2014 as the top selling plug-in electric vehicle in Europe. During 2015, the Outlander plug-in hybrid surpassed the Leaf as the all-time top selling plug-in passenger car in Europe. In 2017, the Outlander PHEV topped plug-in hybrid sales in Europe, for the fifth year running.

European sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in January 2018, and global deliveries achieved the 150,000 unit mark in March 2018. The 200,000th unit milestone was attained in March 2019. Global sales reached 250,000 units in May 2020, and 300,000 units in January 2022. According to JATO Dynamics, the Outlander PHEV became the world&#x27;s all-time best selling plug-in hybrid in December 2018. , the Outlander plug-in hybrid was available for retail sales in 50 countries.

The following table presents retail sales and registrations for the top selling national markets by year through December 2015.
==== Reception ====
The Outlander PHEV was selected as one of the top five finalists for the 2014 World Green Car of the Year.

==== Battery incident ====
In March 2013, the battery pack of an Outlander PHEV at a dealership in Yokohama overheated and melted some of the battery cells, after the vehicle had been fully charged and stood for one day. Nobody was injured in the incident. The battery packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for battery problems. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall but halted production and sales until it determined the cause of the battery problems. The carmaker advised the 4,000 owners of the Outlander plug-in hybrid to drive only on gasoline mode for the time being. On 19 August 2013, after changing a production process to avoid damaging any batteries, Mitsubishi restarted production of the Outlander plug-in hybrid.

<text>The third Gladstone ministry was one of the shortest-lived ministries in British history. It was led by William Ewart Gladstone of the Liberal Party upon his reappointment as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by Queen Victoria. It lasted five months until July 1886.

==Formation==

The Liberal Party under the leadership of William Gladstone came to power in the United Kingdom in February 1886 after they, with the support of the Irish Nationalists, defeated the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury. The ministry was to become one of the most short-lived in British history. Gladstone, aged 76, became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for the third time. Sir William Vernon Harcourt became Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Childers Home Secretary and future prime minister the Earl of Rosebery Foreign Secretary. Lord Selborne and Sir Henry James both rejected the Lord Chancellorship, a post, which, however, was accepted by Sir Farrer Herschell, who was ennobled as Baron Herschell. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Granville became Secretary of State for the Colonies, while another political veteran, Lord Kimberley, resumed the post of Secretary of State for India which he had held from 1882 to 1885. The influential Joseph Chamberlain was appointed President of the Local Government Board while future party leader and Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman was made Secretary of State for War. The government also saw John Morley hold his first ministerial post as Chief Secretary for Ireland.

The ministry is chiefly remembered for Gladstone&#x27;s first attempt to introduce the Home Rule Bill for Ireland. The bill was defeated by a majority of 30 (93 Liberal MP&#x27;s having voted against it) on 8 June and on 26 June Parliament was dissolved. The issue split the Liberal Party. Lord Hartington, who had refused to serve under Gladstone because of his Irish policies, became leader of the Liberal Unionists. He was joined by Joseph Chamberlain, who had resigned over Home Rule in April.

==Fate==
The Conservative Party, with the support of the Liberal Unionists, gained a decisive victory in the July 1886 general election, and Lord Salisbury once again became prime minister. The Liberals were to remain out of office until 1892, when Gladstone became prime minister for a fourth time.

==Cabinet==

===February 1886 to August 1886===





====Changes====
April 1886: James Stansfeld succeeds Joseph Chamberlain at the Local Government Board. George Otto Trevelyan leaves the Cabinet. His successor as Secretary for Scotland is not in the Cabinet.

<text>This article is a collection of quotations and other comments on English playwright William Shakespeare and his works.

Shakespeare enjoyed recognition in his own time, but in the 17th century, some poets and authors began to consider him as the supreme dramatist and poet of all times of the English language. No other dramatist has been performed even remotely as often on the British (and later the world) stage as Shakespeare. Editors and critics have studied the dramatic performances of his texts as well as the language of Shakespeare. His works are read and studied not only by poets and authors, but also by psychoanalysts, psychologists and philosophers.

==17th century==

Ben Jonson, 1630: &quot;I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted out a line. My answer hath been, &#x27;Would he had blotted a thousand,&#x27; which they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this but for their ignorance, who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own candor, for I loved the man, and do honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any. He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometime it was necessary he should be stopped. &#x27;Sufflaminandus erat,&#x27; as Augustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his own power; would the rule of it had been so too. Many times he fell into those things, could not escape laughter, as when he said in the person of Caesar, one speaking to him: &#x27;Caesar, thou dost me wrong.&#x27; He replied: &#x27;Caesar did never wrong but with just cause;&#x27; and such like, which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his vices with his virtues. There was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.&quot; &quot;Timber&quot; or &quot;Discoveries&quot;
John Milton, 1632:
&quot;On Shakespeare&quot; was Milton&#x27;s first published poem &amp; appeared (anonymously) in the 2nd folio of plays by Shakespeare (1632) as &quot;An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W.SHAKESPEARE&quot;.
Samuel Pepys, diary entry for 29 September, 1662: &quot;This day my oaths of drinking wine and going to plays are out, and so I do resolve to take a liberty to-day, and then to fall to them again. To the King&#x27;s Theatre, where we saw &quot;&quot;Midsummer&#x27;s Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; [sic],&quot; which I had never seen before, nor shall ever again, for it is the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life. I saw, I confess, some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure.&quot;

John Dryden, 1668: &quot;To begin then with Shakespeare; he was the man who of all Modern, and perhaps Ancient Poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul. All the Images of Nature were still present to him, and he drew them not laboriously, but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more than see it, you feel it too. Those who accuse him to have wanted learning, give him the greater commendation: he was naturally learn&#x27;d; he needed not the spectacles of Books to read Nature; he look&#x27;d inwards, and found her there.&quot; &quot;Essay of Dramatic Poesy&quot;

Thomas Rymer (neo-classical &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;classical unities&quot; extremist), 1692: &quot;The Moral, sure, of this Fable [&quot;Othello&quot;] is very instructive. First, This may be a caution to all Maidens of Quality how, without their Parents consent, they run away with Blackamoors. Secondly, This may be a warning to all good Wives, that they look well to their Linnen. Thirdly, This may be a lesson to Husbands, that before their Jealousie be Tragical, the proofs may be Mathematical&quot;. 
(Rymer&#x27;s notorious attack on &quot;Othello&quot; ultimately did Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation more good than harm, by firing up John Dryden, John Dennis and other influential critics into writing eloquent replies.)

Samuel Cobb (1675–1713), translator and master at Christ&#x27;s Hospital:
From &quot;Poetica Brittanici&quot; (1700). Cobb provides an example of the diffusion of Jonson&#x27;s concept of Shakespeare as the &quot;child of nature.&quot;

==18th century==
Bevill Higgons: 

From the preface to the revision of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1701) by George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne. Here, Shakespeare is made both to recognize his own lack of sophistication and to approve the neoclassical polish added by Granville.
Joseph Addison, 1712: &quot;Among the English, Shakespeare has incomparably excelled all others. That noble extravagance of fancy, which he had in so great perfection, thoroughly qualified him to touch... his reader&#x27;s imagination, and made him capable of succeeding, where he had nothing to support him besides the strength of his own genius.&quot; &quot;Spectator&quot; no. 419

Alexander Pope, 1725: &quot;His Characters are so much Nature her self that &#x27;tis a sort of injury to call them by so distant a name as Copies of her. Those of other Poets have a constant resemblance, which shews that they receiv&#x27;d them from one another and were but multiplyers of the same image: each picture like a mock-rainbow is but the reflexion of a reflexion. But every single character in Shakespeare is as much an Individual as those in Life itself; it is as impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their relation or affinity in any respect appear most to be Twins will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct. To this life and variety of Character we must add the wonderful Preservation of it; which is such throughout his plays that had all the Speeches been printed without the very names of the persons I believe one might have apply&#x27;d them with certainty to every speaker. . . . I will conclude by saying of Shakespeare, that with all his faults, in comparison of those that are more finished and regular, as upon an ancient majestick piece of &quot;Gothick&quot; architecture, compared with a neat modern building: the latter is more elegant and glaring, but the former is more strong and more solemn . . Nor does the whole fail to strike us with greater reverence, though many of the parts are childish, ill-placed, and unequal to its grandeur.&quot; Preface to Pope&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works
Voltaire, 1733 &quot;Letters concerning the English nation&quot;: He created theatre. He had a genius full of strength and fertility, natural and without any spark of good taste and any knowledge of the rules. I&#x27;ll tell you something hazardous but true: the merit of this author has lost the English theatre; there are such beautiful scenes, such great and at the same time so terrible pieces widespread in his monstrous farces which go by the name of tragedies; these plays have always been performed with great success. The Time, which alone makes the reputation of men, at the end made their faults respectable. The most gigantic and bizarre ideas of this author have earned, after two hundred years, the right to be considered sublime.

Samuel Johnson, 1765 &quot;The Plays of William Shakespeare&quot;: &quot;[Shakespeare&#x27;s] adherence to general nature has exposed him to the censure of criticks, who form their judgments upon narrower principles. Dennis and Rymer think his Romans not sufficiently Roman; and Voltaire censures his kings as not completely royal. ... These are the petty cavils of petty minds.&quot; 
&quot;That it [mixing tragedy and comedy] is a practice contrary to the rules of criticism will be readily allowed; but there is always an appeal open from criticism to nature.&quot; 
&quot;To the unities of time and place he has shewn no regard, and perhaps a nearer view of the principles on which they stand will diminish their value, and withdraw from them the veneration which, from the time of Corneille, they have very generally received by discovering that they have given more trouble to the poet, than pleasure to the auditor.&quot; 
&quot;Perhaps it would not be easy to find any author, except Homer, who invented so much as Shakespeare, who so much advanced the studies which he cultivated, or effused so much novelty upon his age or country. The form, the characters, the language, and the shows of the English drama are his.&quot; 
&quot;The work of a correct and regular writer is a garden accurately formed and diligently planted, varied with shades, and scented with flowers; the composition of Shakespeare is a forest, in which oaks extend their branches, and pines tower in the air, interspersed sometimes with weeds and brambles, and sometimes giving shelter to myrtles and to roses; filling the eye with awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endless diversity. Other poets display cabinets of precious rarities, minutely finished, wrought into shape, and polished unto brightness. Shakespeare opens a mine which contains gold and diamonds in unexhaustible plenty, though clouded by incrustations, debased by impurities, and mingled with a mass of meaner minerals.&quot;

Johann Wolfgang Goethe, 1795–1796 &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; (book IV, chap. 3 and 13): &quot;Prince Hamlet is suddenly facing the need for a great action imposed upon your soul that is unable to do it.&quot; / &quot;He [the character] is a beautiful being that succumbs under the load he can&#x27;t distance itself without it.&quot;

J. W. Goethe, &quot;Writings on literature&quot;: &quot;Much has been said about Shakespeare that does not seem anything left to say, but the spirit has features to stimulate the spirit forever...&quot;
&quot;Shakespeare make effect with vitality of the word, and this is what becomes apparent in reading aloud, when the listener is distracted, not by a flawed or right presentation. There is no pleasure greater and purer than, with closed eyes, accompanied a Shakespeare&#x27;s play, not declaimed, but recited by a safe and natural voice. Follow up the wires with it simple plot developments. For the description of the characters we can to imagine certain pictures, but we must, indeed, through a series of words and speeches, to experiment what is happening internally, and here all who are part of the story seem to have combined not leave anything obscure or in doubt.&quot;
&quot;Shakespeare meets with the spirit of the world. He enters the world as it is spirit. For both, nothing is hidden; but as the work of the spirit of the world is to store mysteries before the action, or even after, the meaning of the poet is going to reveal the mystery, making us confident before the action, or just in run it.&quot;
&quot;Shakespeare stands out singularly, linking the old and new in a lush. Wish and duty trying to put itself in balance in his plays; both are faced with violence, but always so that the wish is at a disadvantage.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps no one has made so great as the first major link of wish and duty in the individual character as Shakespeare did.&quot;

==19th century==

Charles Lamb, 1811: &quot;We talk of Shakespeare&#x27;s admirable observation of life, when we should feel, that not from a petty inquisition into those cheap and every-day characters which surrounded him, as they surround us, but from his own mind, which was, to borrow a phrase of Ben Jonson&#x27;s, the very &#x27;sphere of humanity&#x27; he fetched those images of virtue and of knowledge, of which every one of us recognizing a part, think we comprehend in our natures the whole; and often mistake the powers which he positively creates in us, for nothing more than indigenous faculties of our own minds, which only waited the application of corresponding virtues in him to return a full and clear echo of the same.&quot; &quot;On the Tragedies of Shakespeare&quot;

Thomas de Quincey, 1823: &quot;O, mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely great works of art; but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the flowers,—like frost and snow, rain and dew, hail-storm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission of our own faculties, and in the perfect faith that in them there can be no too much or too little, nothing useless or inert—but that, the further we press in our discoveries, the more we shall see proofs of design and self-supporting arrangement where the careless eye had seen nothing but accident!&quot; &quot;On the Knocking at the Gate in &quot;Macbeth&quot;&quot;.

Thomas Carlyle, 1841: &quot;Nay, apart from spiritualities; and considering him merely as a real, marketable, tangibly useful possession. England, before long, this Island of ours, will hold but a small fraction of the English: in America, in New Holland, east and west to the very Antipodes, there will be a Saxondom covering great spaces of the Globe. And now, what is it that can keep all these together into virtually one Nation, so that they do not fall out and fight, but live at peace, in brotherlike intercourse, helping one another? This is justly regarded as the greatest practical problem, the thing all manner of sovereignties and governments are here to accomplish: what is it that will accomplish this? Acts of Parliament, administrative prime-ministers cannot. America is parted from us, so far as Parliament could part it. Call it not fantastic, for there is much reality in it: Here, I say, is an English King, whom no time or chance, Parliament or combination of Parliaments, can dethrone! This King Shakespeare, does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying-signs; indestructible; really more valuable in that point of view than any other means or appliance whatsoever? We can fancy him as radiant aloft over all the Nations of Englishmen, a thousand years hence. From Paramatta, from New York, wheresoever, under what sort of Parish-Constable soever, English men and women are, they will say to one another: &#x27;Yes, this Shakespeare is ours; we produced him, we speak and think by him; we are of one blood and kind with him.&#x27;&quot; &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History&quot;

Victor Hugo, 1859: &quot;Two exiles, father and son, are on a desert island serving a long sentence. In a morning, sitting in front of the house, the young man asks: &#x27;What do you think of this exile?&#x27; &#x27;It will be long... &quot;, replied the father. &#x27;And how occupy it?&#x27;, continues the young son. The old serene man reply: &#x27;I will look the ocean, and you?&#x27; It is a long silence before the son&#x27;s answer: &#x27;I will translate Shakespeare.&#x27; Shekespeare: the ocean.&quot;

==20th century==

Leo Tolstoy, 1906: &quot;I remember the astonishment I felt when I first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive a powerful aesthetic pleasure, but having read, one after the other, works regarded as his best: &quot;King Lear,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth,&quot; not only did I feel no delight, but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium... Several times I read the dramas and the comedies and historical plays, and I invariably underwent the same feelings: repulsion, weariness, and bewilderment. At the present time, before writing this preface, being desirous once more to test myself, I have, as an old man of seventy-five, again read the whole of Shakespeare, including the historical plays, the &quot;Henrys,&quot; &quot;Troilus and Cressida,&quot; &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, and I have felt, with even greater force, the same feelings,—this time, however, not of bewilderment, but of firm, indubitable conviction that the unquestionable glory of a great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and which compels writers of our time to imitate him and readers and spectators to discover in him non-existent merits,—thereby distorting their aesthetic and ethical understanding,—is a great evil, as is every untruth.&quot; &quot;Tolstoy on Shakespeare.&quot;

D. H. Lawrence, 1928:
:&quot;When I read Shakespeare I am struck with wonder
:that such trivial people should muse and thunder
:in such lovely language
:How boring, how small Shakespeare&#x27;s people are!
:Yet the language so lovely! like the dyes from gas-tar.&quot;

&quot;When I Read Shakespeare&quot; in &quot;The Complete Poems of D. H. Lawrence&quot;.

Sigmund Freud, 1930: &quot;Incidentally, in the meantime, I ceased to believe that the author of Shakespeare&#x27;s works was the man of Stratford.&quot; (Freud supported the theory that the works attributed to Shakespeare were written by Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford, and that this discovery enabled better interpretation of his sonnets) (&quot;Outline of Psychoanalysis&quot;, 1940/1987: 220). Note added in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1900) – Freud, 1900/1987: 260

Freud, 1939: &quot;It is well known that the genius is incomprehensible and irresponsible; so we should bring it to the dance as a full explanation to what the other solution has failed. The same consideration applies also to the remarkable case of William Shakespeare of Stratford.&quot; &quot;Moses and Monotheism&quot;, 1939/1987: 83

W. H. Auden, 1947: &quot;There is a continual process of simplification in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. What is he up to? He is holding the mirror up to nature. In the early minor sonnets he talks about his works outlasting time. But increasingly he suggests, as Theseus does in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, that &quot;The best in this kind are but shadows&quot; (V.i.214), that art is rather a bore. ... I find Shakespeare particularly appealing in his attitude towards his work. There&#x27;s something a little irritating in the determination of the very greatest artists, like Dante, Joyce, Milton, to create masterpieces and to think themselves important. To be able to devote one&#x27;s life to art without forgetting that art is frivolous is a tremendous achievement of personal character. Shakespeare never takes himself too seriously.&quot; &quot;Lectures on Shakespeare&quot; (ed. by Arthur Kirsch)

T. S. Eliot: &quot;Dante and Shakespeare divide the modern world between them, there is no third.&quot; &quot;Dante&quot;, 1929

T. S. Eliot, 1922: &quot;We must simply admit that here Shakespeare tackled a problem which proved too much for him. Why he attempted it at all is an insoluble puzzle; under compulsion of what experience he attempted to express the inexpressibly horrible, we cannot ever know. We need a great many facts in his biography; and we should like to know whether, and when, and after or at the same time as what personal experience, he read Montaigne, II. xii., &quot;Apologie de Raimond Sebond&quot;. We should have, finally, to know something which is by hypothesis unknowable, for we assume it to be an experience which, in the manner indicated, exceeded the facts. We should have to understand things which Shakespeare did not understand himself.&quot; &quot;Hamlet and His Problems&quot;, in &quot;The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism&quot;.

Otto Maria Carpeaux: &quot;The greatest poet of modern times and—except for the limitations of our critical judgement—of all time.&quot;

Allan Bloom, 1964: &quot;Shakespeare devotes great care to establishing the political setting in almost all his plays, and his greatest heroes are rulers who exercise capacities which can only be exercised within civil society. To neglect this is simply to be blinded by the brilliance of one&#x27;s own prejudices. As soon as one sees this, one cannot help asking what Shakespeare thought about a good regime and a good ruler.&quot; on his &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Politics&quot; (with Harry V. Jaffa).

Kenneth Burke: &quot;Shakespeare found many ingenious ways to make it seem that his greatest plays unfolded of themselves, like a destiny rather than by a technical expert’s scheming. . . . He spontaneously knew how to translate some typical tension or conflict of his society into terms of variously interrelated personalities—and his function as a dramatist was to let that whole complexity act itself out, by endowing each personality with the appropriate ideas, images, attitudes, actions, situations, relationships, and fatality. The true essence of his “beliefs” was thus embodied in the vision of that complexity itself. . . . Perhaps in this sense Shakespeare never wrote the ideal Shakespearean play; but again and again he came close to it. . . . he was the sort of craftsman who, if we believed such-and-such, could make a great play out of such beliefs, and could as easily have made a great play out of the opposite beliefs, if those others were what moved us. For what he believed in above all was the glory of his trade itself, which is to say, the great humaneness of the word . . . so masterfully embodied in Shakespeare’s blithe dramaturgic schemings.&quot; &quot;Kenneth Burke on Shakespeare&quot;

Stephen Booth, 1994: &quot;A good metaphor for ... the action of casual, incidental relationships among words and ideas in Shakespeare is &quot;patina&quot;. Networks of nonsensical relationship act upon speeches and plays the way a patina does upon artwork in metal. They smooth across seams and deny them without obliterating them. Grosser examples of the effect have been noted in literature ever since people started analyzing double plots and noticing echoing situations and spotting thematic common denominators and sustained patterns of imagery.&quot; &quot;Close Reading Without Readings&quot;

Harold Bloom, 1994: &quot;...Shakespeare is the Canon. He sets the standard and the limits of literature.&quot; &quot;The Western Canon&quot;

== 21st century ==
Daniel S. Burt, 2009: &quot;It should come as no surprise to see William Shakespeare placed at the head of a ranking of the most influential literary artists of all time. At literature’s most basic and elemental level of language, form, and vision, Shakespeare’s power is unequaled. If the mark of a writer’s greatness is the creation of the largest imaginary universe populated by believable characters and the reflection of the widest human experience, surely Shakespeare is alone in the magnitude of his achievement. Acknowledged as the greatest English writer, unrivaled in popular and critical acclaim, Shakespeare is also the recognized international master whose universality communicates across cultural divides.&quot;

Stanley Wells, 2016: &quot;His plays give us the greatest sense of the value of human life; of how people live; of how people love and of the importance of human relationships than any other writers of his time or of any other time. Shakespeare’s plays are as popular as they are because he was perhaps the greatest writer who has ever lived.&quot;

<text>Caffé Lavena is a café in the city of Venice, Italy.

It was established in 1750, and was originally called Regina d&#x27;Ungheria (the Queen of Hungary) under the Austro-Hungarian empire. The café has its origins in the popular Venice of the 17th century, it became later Orso Coronato (Crowned Bear) because of the picturesque sign showing a bear standing on his hind legs with a crown on its head. In 1860, Carlo Lavena bought the cafè and it has remained in his family ever since.

<text>Edward Rowland Sill (April 29, 1841February 27, 1887) was an American poet and educator.

==Biography==

Born in Windsor, Connecticut, he graduated from Yale in 1861, where he was Class Poet and a member of Skull and Bones. He engaged in business in California, and entered the Harvard Divinity School in 1867 but soon left for a position on the staff of the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot;. After teaching at Wadsworth and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (1868–1871), he became principal of Oakland High School in Oakland, California.

From 1874 to 1882, Sill was professor of English literature at the University of California. His health failing, he returned to Cuyahoga Falls in 1883. He devoted himself to literary work, abundant and largely anonymous, until his death in 1887 in Cleveland, Ohio.

In 1904 Mount Sill, a peak in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California and the state&#x27;s sixth-highest mountain, was named for him by noted mountaineer Joseph LeConte.

==Works==

Much of his poetry was contributed to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. Many of his prose essays appeared in &quot;The Contributors Club&quot;, and others appeared in the main body of the &quot;Atlantic&quot;. Among his works are:
* A translation of Rau&#x27;s &quot;Mozart&quot; (1868).
* &quot;The Hermitage and Other Poems&quot; (1868).
* &quot;Opportunity&quot; (1880)
* &quot;The Venus of Milo and Other Poems&quot; (1883), a farewell tribute to his California friends.
* &quot;Poems&quot; (1887).
* &quot;The Hermitage and Later Poems&quot; (1889). 1892 reprint
* &quot;Hermione and Other Poems&quot; (1899).
* Prose of Edward Rowland Sill&quot; (1900).
* &quot;The Poems of Edward Rowland Sill&quot; (1902).

A memorial volume was privately printed by his friends in 1887. A biographical sketch in &quot;The Poetical Works of Edward Rowland Sill&quot;, edited by William Belmont Parker with Mrs Sill&#x27;s assistance was printed in 1906, and his poem &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (1879) was selected for inclusion in the &quot;Yale Book of American Verse&quot; in 1912.

Sill was the subject of biographies by William Belmont Parker in 1915 and by Alfred Riggs Ferguson in 1955. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;He was a modest and charming man, a graceful essayist, a sure critic. His contribution to American poetry is small but of fine quality. His best poems, such as &quot;The Venus of Milo&quot;, &quot;The Fool&#x27;s Prayer&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, gave him a high place among the minor poets of America, which might have been higher but for his early death.&quot;

<doc id="1277617" wikidata="Q608514" url="?curid=1277617" title="Charles Oakley">
<text>Charles Oakley (born December 18, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player. Oakley is best known for playing 10 of his 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association with the New York Knicks. As a power forward, he consistently ranked as one of the best rebounders and defensive players in the NBA. He also played for the Chicago Bulls, Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards, and Houston Rockets. Since 2017, he has been the coach of the Killer 3&#x27;s of the BIG3.

==Early life==
Charles Oakley was born December 18, 1963, in Cleveland, Ohio, where he was raised. Oakley attended John Hay High School, where he excelled in basketball.

==College career==
Oakley attended Virginia Union University, a Division II historically black university in Richmond, Virginia. As a senior in 1984–85, Oakley led Virginia Union to the 1985 NCAA championship. The Panthers had a 31–1 overall record that year, with Oakley averaging 24 points and 17.3 rebounds a game. Oakley was named the NCAA Division II Player of the Year. He scored 2,379 points and grabbed 1,642 rebounds in his college career.

==Professional career==

=== Chicago Bulls (1985–1988) ===
Oakley was drafted with the 9th overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, but his draft rights were traded to the Chicago Bulls, alongside Calvin Duncan, for Ennis Whatley and Keith Lee. Oakley provided another scoring option and steady offensive and defensive performances to an up-and-coming Bulls squad led by Michael Jordan. On March 15, 1986, Oakley set a career high in points scored with 35, during a 125–116 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Oakley was selected as a part of the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 1986.
Oakley also assumed the role of the team &quot;enforcer&quot;, whose duty primarily was to protect young Jordan against cheap shots and roughhousing tactics of opposing players. He was given the nickname, &quot;Oak Tree&quot;, for his rugged demeanor and no-nonsense attitude. On April 26, 1987, Oakley set a postseason career high with 25 points scored, alongside grabbing 15 rebounds, in a loss to the Boston Celtics.

===New York Knicks (1988–1998)===
With the drafting and development of Horace Grant, the Bulls traded Oakley to the New York Knicks for 7&#x27;1&quot; center Bill Cartwright. Oakley eventually became a part of the core which the Knicks built around, which also featured Patrick Ewing, John Starks, Anthony Mason and point guard Mark Jackson.

During the Knicks&#x27; 1994 season, which included a record 25 playoff games, Oakley started every regular season and playoff game for a record 107 starts in a single season. On June 1, 1994, Oakley scored 12 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and recorded 7 assists in a Game 5 loss to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Knicks eventually won that series. The following round, during that year&#x27;s NBA Finals, Oakley averaged 11 points and 11.9 rebounds per game in a tightly contested seven-game series loss to the Houston Rockets.

Charles Oakley was one of the greats. On March 11, 1998, Oakley grabbed a season high 22 rebounds in a loss against former teammate Anthony Mason and the Charlotte Hornets. Despite regular season success and consistent playoffs appearances, the Knicks did not return to the Finals again during Oakley&#x27;s tenure. During his time with the Knicks, Oakley was known across the league for being a defensive specialist and outstanding rebounder.

===Toronto Raptors (1998–2001)===
In 1998, Oakley was traded by New York to the Toronto Raptors, alongside Sean Marks, for blossoming star Marcus Camby. For the Raptors, he provided a veteran presence to a young team that included Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady. On January 7, 2001, Oakley set a career high with 6 blocks, and also narrowly missed a triple-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists.

===Return to Chicago (2001–2002)===
In 2001, Oakley was traded by the Toronto Raptors with a 2002 2nd-round pick to the Chicago Bulls for Brian Skinner. This was his second tenure with the Bulls. Starting 36 of his 57 played games, he averaged 3.8 points per game, 6 rebounds per game, and 2 assists per game.

===Washington Wizards (2002–2003)===
In 2002, Oakley signed as a free agent with the Washington Wizards, where he was reunited with former teammate Michael Jordan. Oakley played 42 games during the 2002–03 season, averaging 1.8 points per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, and 1 assist per game.

=== Houston Rockets (2004) ===
The 2003–04 season was Oakley&#x27;s last season. On March 18, 2004, Oakley signed the first of two 10-day contracts with the Houston Rockets. Oakley played only 7 games, in which he averaged 1.3 points per game, 0.7 rebounds per game, and 0.3 assists per game. At the end of the season, Oakley retired from the NBA.

In 2007 Oakley was reported to be attempting an NBA comeback, at age 44. He claimed Dallas, Miami, Cleveland and New York were interested, but said he would &quot;not [come] back cheap&quot;.

==Coaching and businesses==
On December 26, 2010, Oakley was hired as an assistant coach for the Charlotte Bobcats under then-head coach Paul Silas.

He left that position on December 1, 2011, after experiencing health issues with back pain, during the 2010–11 season.

Oakley owns several commercial enterprises, including: 
* Hair Solutions and Nails EtCetera in east Cleveland, Ohio, &quot;salons started with seed money from Oakley and run by his sisters&quot;
* Oakley&#x27;s car wash, oil change, and detail centers in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn and Yonkers, New York
* Oakley&#x27;s Wash House, a combination car wash and laundromat Oakley founded in east Cleveland, Ohio, overseen by his sister Carolyn and mother Corine
* Red, The Steakhouse, restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio, and South Beach, Miami, Florida

==Legacy==
Oakley was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in honor of his 19-year professional basketball career. The induction ceremony was held on April 30, 2016.

In September 2016, a portion of Deering Street in Oakley&#x27;s hometown of Cleveland (near his alma mater of John Hay High School) was renamed Charles Oakley Way in his honor.

He was inducted into the CIAA Hall of Fame in 2005 after his career at Virginia Union University.

===Career highlights===
*He placed in the top ten in rebounds per game five times between 1987 and 1994 (second in 1987 and 1988).
*Due to his durability he actually placed in the top ten in total rebounds 6 times and led the league in total rebounds twice (1987 and 1988). 
*In 1994, he became an NBA All-Star and was chosen to the league&#x27;s All-Defense 1st team.
*Oakley currently ranks 25th all-time in NBA games played with 1,282 games, and 22nd all-time in career rebounds with 12,205 rebounds.

==Personal life==
Back in 2011, Oakley filed a lawsuit against the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, alleging a group assault by five security guards employed by the casino on May 28, 2010.

On July 30, 2016, Oakley married his wife Angela Reed.

=== Madison Square Garden arrest ===
On February 8, 2017, Oakley was involved in an altercation at Madison Square Garden as the Knicks faced the visiting Los Angeles Clippers. According to the Knicks, Oakley was ejected from the arena after he is alleged to have yelled at James L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman of Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks, and refused to stop, an allegation he denies. There were also accounts of him hitting a security guard in his face and shoving another guard before being dragged away from the game and handcuffed. He was charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault and criminal trespassing. In a statement, the Knicks stated that Oakley &quot;came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. He was ejected and was then arrested by the New York City Police Department.&quot;

In response, Oakley claimed that he sat down in his seat and he saw the Knicks owner James Dolan look at him and within four minutes he was being asked to leave the arena. He says that he didn&#x27;t become combative until he was asked to leave for no apparent reason. While admitting &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have put my hands on anyone,&quot; Oakley disputed the Knicks&#x27; rendition of events in an interview with ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, which reported that Oakley says he &quot;never said a word to Dolan&quot; and &quot;was minding his own business when he was confronted by Madison Square Garden Security, who asked why he was sitting so close to Dolan before demanding that he leave the building.&quot;

On February 13, 2017, NBA legend Michael Jordan and NBA commissioner Adam Silver met with both Dolan and Oakley at NBA headquarters. Oakley and Dolan both apologized for the fallout and both were currently negotiating a truce. &quot;Both Mr. Oakley and Mr. Dolan were apologetic about the incident and subsequent comments, and their negative impact on the Knicks organization and the NBA,&quot; Silver said. The statement says Dolan hopes Oakley can return to MSG as his guest in the near future. On February 14, 2017, the ban from Madison Square Garden was lifted. On September 12, 2017, it was reported that Oakley was filing a civil lawsuit over the incident. As of February 2022, the suit was still in litigation, according to Oakley.

Oakley later retorted on March 11, 2019, that Dolan is someone who tries to bully everyone because he has money and power as an owner of the Knicks, quoting that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make sense.&quot; He also admits he has very little reason to hold any reconciliation with Dolan, noting his relationship with the Knicks was frayed before the incident occurred (though he still bought himself tickets for Knicks games a few times each season before the incident), while also saying nothing was really resolved from his meeting with Adam Silver. Oakley further notes the incident caused a damaged relationship with the team, to the point where the possibility of his jersey being retired was in jeopardy. This all came out after Dolan threatened to ban a fan from the arena for yelling at him to &quot;sell the team&quot; a few days prior.

<text>Heinrich is a small lunar impact crater on the Mare Imbrium, a lunar mare in the northwest quadrant of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after Czechoslovakian astronomer . It is a circular, bowl-shaped formation very similar to many other craters of comparable size on the Moon.

Heinrich lies to the southwest of the prominent crater Timocharis, and was previously designated as Timocharis A before being given its current name by the IAU. It is otherwise a relatively isolated formation with only a few tiny satellite craters of Timocharis located nearby.

<doc id="1277625" wikidata="Q935290" url="?curid=1277625" title="University of Wales, Newport">
<text>The University of Wales, Newport (), was a public university based in Newport, South Wales, before the merger that formed the University of South Wales in April 2013. The university was founded as a mechanics&#x27; institute in 1841 and became an affiliated institution of the University of Wales in 1992. It had two campuses in Newport, Caerleon on the northern outskirts of the city, and a campus on the east bank of the River Usk in Newport city centre. 

In 2012 the university was ranked 111th out of 120 UK universities in the Guardian League Table for university rankings, 105th out of 116 in The Complete University Guide and 104th out of 116 UK universities in the Times Good University Guide.

==History==
Newport had been involved in higher education since 1841. Originally a mechanics&#x27; institute, set up to provide further education for workers and tradesmen, it was based in Newport&#x27;s Town Hall on Commercial Street. Working men and women were able to attend a variety of lectures for two shillings per quarter to study subjects including &quot;The Pursuit of Attainment and Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Popular Superstition&quot;.

The institution was later formed as &quot;Gwent College of Higher Education&quot; by a merger of the Caerleon College of Education (the former Monmouthshire Training College), the Newport College of Art and Design and the Gwent College of Technology in 1975. All three former institutions had established regional and national reputations, most notably the College of Art with many of its students gaining commissions from the BBC and other major organisations in light of the college being among a select number of art colleges in the country awarded Diploma in Art and Design status.

The college became an affiliated institution of the University of Wales in 1992, being admitted as a university college in 1996 where there was a ceremony at which trumpeters of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Division played a fanfare from the top of the university clocktower and balloons were released in the faculty colours.

In May 2004, the University of Wales College, Newport secured Privy Council approval to use the title University of Wales, Newport, as a full constituent of the federal university.

On 1 August 2011, the university was restructured, creating two new faculties, each containing three schools:

The Faculty of Arts and Business
* School of Design, Engineering, Fashion and Technology
* School of Film, Photography and Digital Media
* Newport Business School

The Faculty of Education and Social Sciences
* School of Education
* School of Humanities and Lifelong Learning
* School of Sport, Health and Applied Social Sciences

The Centre for Community and Lifelong Learning (CCLL) continued to be based in Tredegar and focused on the university&#x27;s work to widen participation within the Heads of the Valleys and the wider Gwent region. CCLL was also a key deliverer of the UHOVI (Universities, Heads of the Valleys Institute) project in partnership with the University of Glamorgan and Further Education Colleges.

===Proposed merger===
Along with the University of Glamorgan and Cardiff Metropolitan University, it was proposed by the Welsh Government that the University of Wales, Newport merge to create a single post-92 university in South East Wales.

The plans proved to be highly controversial, with Cardiff Metropolitan opposing any merger, citing the lack of a business case, concerns that the new institution would simply be too big to manage properly, and the &#x27;predatory&#x27; attitude of Glamorgan. Newport, however, welcomed the plans, providing they created a genuinely new institution. 

Stephen Hagen, appointed Acting Vice-Chancellor by the Newport Board from 1 June 2012 to lead the merger upon the sudden resignation of Peter Noyes, circulated a proposal for the new university to focus on entrepreneurialism, generating start-ups, equipping students with entrepreneurial skills and supporting the industries of South Wales, a concept which was initially well received by the Minister&#x27;s Office.

In July 2012, Newport and Glamorgan announced talks to create a new University for South Wales, citing the opportunity to: &quot;build on their respective strengths to develop a new, entrepreneurial model of higher education across south Wales&quot;. The university was dissolved on 11 April 2013 absorbed into University of Glamorgan and renamed University of South Wales.

In response to Cardiff Metropolitan&#x27;s opposition to its involvement in any merger plans, Leighton Andrews (a strong proponent of mergers) threatened to forcibly dissolve Cardiff Metropolitan and hand its assets over to the new university formed by Glamorgan. Cardiff Metropolitan still demanded more evidence before committing to further talks and, in November 2012, Leighton Andrews withdrew a consultation on plans to force a merger.

==Campuses==

The university opened a new £35 million campus in Newport&#x27;s city centre formally on 10 January 2011. The project was a collaboration between the university, Newport City Council and the Welsh Assembly Government operating through Newport Unlimited, the urban regeneration company for the city.

The campus is situated on the western side of the River Usk in the city centre and it was the first phase of an intended £50m development for the university. It housed the Faculty of Arts and Business whilst the Caerleon campus housed the Faculty of Education and Social Sciences. The campus was part of a major redevelopment of Newport city centre. The old city campus at Allt-yr-yn was closed and demolished.

==Reputation==
The university had been involved in higher education since 1841. In 2009, it was rated the number one university in Wales for enterprise education by the Knowledge Exploitation Fund.

The School of Film, Photography and Digital Media taught a documentary photography degree programme as well as housing the Newport Film School, founded by John Grierson in 1966 and producing many award-winning film-makers since then.

The 2010 CILECT Congress (the international association for film and television schools) unanimously voted in Newport Film School as a full member – only two of the ten new applicant schools for full membership were given this accolade.

==Students&#x27; Union==
Newport Students&#x27; Union was the students&#x27; union representing all students at the university. The union was run day-to-day by a team of sabbatical officers. Alongside this sabbatical team, full-time and part-time staff were employed to assist in the operation of the union and part-time officers, team captains, society presidents and student managers who all worked alongside their studies to assist the union.

Newport Students&#x27; Union provided a range of sports teams, societies and entertainment for students to get involved in. The union also housed a newspaper (&quot;NewsPort&quot;), magazine (&quot;newtwo&quot;), TV station (NTV) and radio station (Radio Noize). As well as weekly social events and club nights, the union organised Freshers&#x27; Fortnight, Freshers&#x27; Fayre, Re: Freshers Week, RAG (Raising and Giving Week) and the May Ball.

<text>The Pulaski Day Parade is a parade held annually since 1937 on Fifth Avenue in New York City to commemorate Casimir Pulaski, a Polish hero of the American Revolutionary War. The parade runs from 35th to 54th Streets passing by St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. It is held on the first Sunday of October and closely coincides with the October 11th General Pulaski Memorial Day, a national observance of his death at the Siege of Savannah. The parade features Polish dancers, Polish Supplementary schools and organizations, Polish soccer teams and their mascots, scouts of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association, and Polish Government ambassadors and representatives.6

The Parade was first held in 1937. Its founder was Francis J. Wazeter, president of the Downstate New York division of the Polish American Congress. There was no parade in 1942 nor 2020.

It is one of the oldest ethnic parades in NYC.

<text>Lucas (or Lukas) David (1503 - April 1583) was a German historian, who from ca. 1550 on compiled extensive volumes on Prussian history.

== Life ==
David was born in Allenstein (Olsztyn), Royal Prussia, Poland, to Gerhard Dönhoff. He studied at the University of Leipzig, where he also received a &quot;Magister&quot; degree. Despite having converted to Protestantism, he served as the chancellor of Bishop Tiedemann Giese between 1540 and 1549. After Giese received the Diocese of Warmia, David joined the ducal court of Albert, Duke of Prussia, in Königsberg (Królewiec) (today Kaliningrad) in 1549, taking his oath on 26 March 1550.

Albert commissioned a work on the history of Prussia, mainly to counter the - in his view - biased Polish and Catholic works. However, he was only able to produce a recent history of Prussia before he died. His son, Albert Frederick, however, continued the efforts, and instructed David to compile a history of Prussia. This was also supported by various social classes, which believed that the Polish histories belittled Prussian achievements. Hence David researched documents of Prussian history, and started to write his &quot;Prussian Chronicles&quot; (&quot;Preußische Chronik&quot;) from ca. 1575. While David utilized large parts of the work of Simon Grunau, he also frequently corrected errors by Grunau.

David married a wealthy widow in Leipzig. He instituted scholarships at the University of Leipzig, mainly for poor students from his hometown.

Before David was able to complete his chronicles, he died at Königsberg in 1583 at the age of 80. The chronicle ends with the events preceding the Battle of Grunwald (or Tannenberg) in 1410; other sources state that his works extend till 1475. His works were largely unknown to his contemporaries, and were re-discovered only around 1720, with another 100 years before their first publication in the years between 1812–17 in eight volumes. Since then he has become well known past the borders of his homeland for these &quot;Prussian Chronicles&quot;. He is ranked as a &#x27;modern&#x27; historian, as he based his studies on historical sources.

The &quot;Prussica-Sammlung Trunz&quot; started by another Allenstein native, Dr. August Trunz (1875-1963), contains works by David. It is housed in the library of the University of Münster.

<doc id="1277632" wikidata="Q141945" url="?curid=1277632" title="Huernia">
<text>The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.

The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus &quot;Stapelia&quot;, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera &quot;Stapelia&quot; and &quot;Hoodia&quot;. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus &quot;Tavaresia&quot;, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera &quot;Orbea&quot;, &quot;Piaranthus&quot; and &quot;Stapelia&quot;.

The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.

Various species of &quot;Huernia&quot; are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus &quot;baqibaqa&quot; indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that &quot;baqibaqa&quot; tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.

== Species ==
The following species of &quot;Huernia&quot; are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).

<text>Heis is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the western part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after German astronomer Eduard Heis. It is located to the northeast of the crater Delisle, and south of C. Herschel. Due east is the wrinkle ridge Dorsum Heim. Heis is a circular, symmetrical formation with an interior floor that is about half the diameter of the outer rim. The tiny satellite crater Heis A intrudes slightly into the northern rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Heis.

<text>Murfatlar () is a town in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania. It officially became a town in 1989, as a result of the Romanian rural systematization program.

==Etymology==
The name of the town originates from the Turkish word of Arabic origin &quot;murvet&quot; (meaning &quot;generous man&quot;).

Between 1921 and 1965, and from 1975 to 2007, the locality was known as &quot;Basarabi&quot;. On June 26, 2007 the lower house of Romania&#x27;s Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, approved a proposal to have the name changed back to Murfatlar, which was also ratified by the Senate and promulgated by the president of Romania on December 20, 2007.

The village of Siminoc (historical name: &quot;Turc-Murfat&quot;) is administered by the town of Murfatlar. The name of the village comes from the flower Helichrysum arenarium (&quot;siminoc&quot; in Romanian), which can be found abundantly in the area.

The Murfatlar Vineyard and Basarabi Cave Complex are located nearby.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Murfatlar had a population of 9,173. At the 2011 census, the town had 9,634 residents; of those, 8,657 were Romanians (89.86%), 547 Tatars (5.68%), 236 Roma (2.45%), 134 Turks (1.39%), 9 Hungarians (0.09%), 3 Aromanians (0.03%), 16 others (0.17%), and 32 with undeclared ethnicity (0.33%).

==Natives==
