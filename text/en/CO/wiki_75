<text>Benjamin Alexandro Agosto (born January 15, 1982) is an American ice dancer. With partner Tanith Belbin, Agosto is the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, a four-time World medalist, the 2004–2006 Four Continents champion, and 2004–2008 U.S. champion.

==Personal life==
Benjamin Agosto was born January 15, 1982, in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Northbrook, Illinois. He is the son of a Puerto Rican father and a Jewish mother whose family have roots in Romania and Russia. Agosto attended grade school at the Chicago Waldorf School, then spent two years at Glenbrook North High School, and graduated with honors from Michigan&#x27;s Groves High School in June 2000. He played in a high school jazz band.

Agosto lived in Detroit, Michigan, from June 1998 and then Canton, Michigan, before moving to Aston, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 2008. He relocated to Lacey, Washington, in September 2010 and then to Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2014.

==Career==

=== Early years ===
Agosto started skating at age six, after receiving a pair of ice skates for his birthday, and started ice dancing at about age 12. Early in his career, he was coached by Susie Wynne. He skated with Katie Hill from 1995 to 1998, competing with her on the novice and junior levels, including internationally. They skated out of Midwestern Section. When that partnership ended, Agosto moved from Chicago to Michigan in 1998 in order to train under Igor Shpilband.

=== Partnership with Belbin ===
In 1998, Agosto&#x27;s coach partnered him with Canadian Tanith Belbin. In the 1999–2000 season, they won a pair of medals on the ISU Junior Grand Prix series and finished 4th at the JGP Final. They went on to win the U.S. junior national title and then took the bronze medal at the 2000 World Junior Championships. In 2000–2001, Belbin/Agosto competed again on the JGP series, taking gold in all three of their events including the Final. They appeared on the senior level at the 2001 U.S. Championships and won the silver medal, qualifying them for their first senior World Championships, where they finished 17th.

In 2001–2002, Belbin/Agosto made their senior Grand Prix debut and won another silver medal at the U.S. Championships, which would have qualified them for the 2002 Winter Olympics if Belbin had been an American citizen. Instead, Belbin/Agosto were sent to all the other ISU Championships for which they were eligible: Four Continents, Junior Worlds, and Worlds. They won the 2002 World Junior Championships, completing their set of medals from that event. Following that season, Agosto aged out of juniors.

Belbin/Agosto won the 2004 U.S. national title and would go on to repeat four times. At Nationals in 2005, the last year of the 6.0 system, they received straight perfect sixes for presentation in their free dance. Of the 30 6.0s given out in ice dance at U.S. Nationals, Belbin/Agosto have 14 of them. Their total 6.0 count at the U.S. Championships is second only to Michelle Kwan (38).

In February 2005, Belbin/Agosto organized and performed in their own figure skating benefit show, Skate Aid for Tsunami Relief, which raised more than $37,000 for Red Cross relief efforts.

Belbin/Agosto won the silver medal at the 2005 World Championships. Their silver medal combined with the placement of the other American team earned the United States three spots to the Olympics in ice dance, the first time this had happened since 1984. By a special act of Congress that passed on December 28, 2005, which President Bush signed on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2005, Belbin became a naturalized citizen of the US, making her able to compete for the United States at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Belbin/Agosto went on to win the Olympic silver medal in ice dance on February 20, 2006. They were the first American ice dance team since 1976, the first year ice dancing was contested at the Olympics, to win an Olympic medal.

Belbin/Agosto began the 2006–2007 season with a free dance called That&#x27;s Entertainment but arrived at Nationals with a new program to the music of Amelie. They won gold at Nationals, the silver medal at Four Continents, and the bronze at Worlds.

In 2007–2008, they won gold medals at both Skate America and Cup of China which qualified them for the Grand Prix Final, where they took the silver medal. They won their 5th national title and then placed 4th at the 2008 Worlds after a fall by Belbin in the compulsory dance. Belbin/Agosto were regular cast members of the Champions on Ice tour from 2004 until COI went out of business following the 2007 season. They were guest stars on part of the 2008 Stars on Ice tour.

In April 2008, Belbin/Agosto left Igor Shpilband and began working with the married coaching team of Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi Karponosov at the Ice Works Skating Complex in Aston, Pennsylvania. In addition to teaching different technique, Linichuk advised Belbin to gain 10 pounds and develop some muscles in order to skate faster and more fluidly. This also gave Belbin more core strength to hold her positions better, thus making lifts easier for Agosto.

Belbin/Agosto began the 2008–2009 season at the 2008 Skate America and 2008 Cup of China, winning silver at both competitions. They withdrew from the 2008–2009 ISU Grand Prix Final after the original dance due to a back injury to Agosto. They withdrew from the 2009 U.S. Championships before the event began to due Agosto&#x27;s injury. They were named to the team to the 2009 World Championships. At Worlds, they won the original dance and placed second in the compulsory and free dances to win the silver medal overall.

Belbin/Agosto won both their Grand Prix events in the 2009-10 season: the 2009 Cup of China and the 2009 Skate America. They withdrew from the Grand Prix Final for medical reasons. At the 2010 U.S. Championships, they were unable to reclaim their national title, finishing second behind Meryl Davis and Charlie White. Belbin/Agosto were nominated to represent the United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics. They finished 4th in the Olympic ice dancing event. They did not compete at the 2010 World Championships.

On June 10, 2010, Belbin and Agosto announced their retirement from eligible skating. Since then they have toured professionally in ice shows.

On December 15, 2015, U.S. Figure Skating announced Belbin and Agosto would be members of the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame Class of 2016. The induction ceremony was held on January 22, 2016, at the 2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.

=== Later career ===
Agosto works as a coach and choreographer. He has choreographed for three &quot;Disney on Ice&quot; shows and in 2014, he became the director of ice dance at the Ice Den in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Agosto also worked as a voice actor for a video game in 2006, and expressed an interest in continuing in the field. He has performed on television as a spokesperson for the United States Census.

<doc id="1299113" wikidata="Q2839535" url="?curid=1299113" title="Two-handed manual alphabets">
<text>Several manual alphabets in use around the world employ two hands to represent some or all of the letters of an alphabet, usually as a part of a deaf sign language. Two-handed alphabets are less widespread than one-handed manual alphabets. They may be used to represent the Latin alphabet (for example in the manual alphabet used in Turkish Sign Language) or the Cyrillic alphabet (as is sometimes used in Yugoslav Sign Language).

== BANZSL alphabet ==
This alphabet is used in the BANZSL group of sign languages. It has been used in British Sign Language and Auslan since at least the 19th century, and in New Zealand Sign Language since the 1970s. Variations of this alphabet are also used in dialects of Indo-Pakistani Sign Language.

=== Notes ===
* Signs may be made with the left or right hand as the dominant hand, but the roles do not usually switch when fingerspelling. The dominant hand generally acts as a pointer (or &quot;pen&quot;) while the secondary hand acts as &quot;paper&quot;.
* The vowels A, E, I, O and U are formed by touching each digit respectively, starting with the thumb.
* The letters C, D, J, K, P, Q, T, V, X, and Y make the shape of the letter itself.
* The letters B, F, G, L, M, N, R, S, and W suggest the shape of the letter.
* The letters G, L and R suggest only the lowercase form of the letter.
* Only the letters H and Z do not have a strong relation to their shape or position in the alphabet.
* Many letters appear backwards (for example, in right-handed fingerspelling, R and D often appears backwards to the viewer). This is not a mistake or a problem, and your signing does not need to be adjusted to compensate.

== BANZSL deafblind alphabet==
This is a variation on the above alphabet, modified for tactile use by those communicating with people who are deafblind.

The sender holds the wrist of the receiver. The receiver&#x27;s hand is relaxed, with the palm open and fingers slightly apart. The signer uses their dominant hand like a pen to sign on the non-dominant hand of the receiver. As a beginner, you may squeeze the wrist of the receiver between words since you will spell haltingly. Once you can spell fluently, simply put a short pause between words. AEIOU are the pads of each finger, beginning with the thumb.
;A: BANZSL &quot;A&quot; is signed on the tip of the thumb
;B: The fingers and thumb are held together to form half of the BANZSL &quot;B&quot; and placed on the palm
;C: Draw your finger along the edge of the thumb and up the index finger, alternatively the direction of the sweep can be reversed
;D: The signer forms half of the BANZSL &quot;D&quot; with their dominant hand and places it against the recessive hand of the receiver; an alternative is to use the index and middle finger placed against the recessive hand
;E: BANZSL &quot;E&quot; is signed on the tip of the index finger
;F: Half of the BANZSL &quot;F&quot; is signed either on the palm or on the top of the receiver&#x27;s index finger
;G: Half of the BANZSL &quot;G&quot; is signed on the palm
;H: BANZSL &quot;H&quot; is signed across the palm
;I: BANZSL &quot;I&quot; is signed on the tip of the middle finger
;J: BANZSL &quot;J&quot; is signed on the hand of the receiver
;K: Half of the BANZSL &quot;K&quot; is signed on the first knuckle of the index finger
;L: BANZSL &quot;L&quot; is signed on the palm
;M: BANZSL &quot;M&quot; is signed on the palm
;N: BANZSL &quot;N&quot; is signed on the palm
;O: BANZSL &quot;O&quot; is signed on the tip of the ring finger
;P: Pinch the pad and nail of the index finger (P for pinch)
;Q: Hook your curled index finger around the thumb
;R: BANZSL &quot;R&quot; is signed on the palm
;S: Hook your curled index finger around the little finger
;T: BANZSL &quot;T&quot; is signed on the receiver&#x27;s hand
;U: BANZSL &quot;U&quot; is signed on the tip of the little finger
;V: BANZSL &quot;V&quot; is signed on the palm
;W: There are three ways to do this; all are acceptable, but your receiver might not know them all:
;X: Half of the BANZSL &quot;X&quot; is signed on the index finger
;Y: The index finger is used to sign a BANZSL &quot;Y&quot; on the hand of the receiver
;Z: The side of the palm is placed on the palm of the receiver

== Other deafblind alphabets ==

From &quot;Deafblind Manual Alphabet&quot;, on Deafblind Information, Senses Australia (links added):

:&quot;Variations of this alphabet used in some dialects of Indo-Pakistani Sign Language.
:&quot;Other forms of manual deafblind alphabet are used around the world - eg. The Lorm Deafblind Manual Alphabet (Belgium). In some countries, eg. Sweden, the one-handed alphabet used is modified by applying the shape of the letter into the hand of the person who is deafblind at a different angle, making the shape easier to feel.&quot;

== Turkish manual alphabet ==

== Yugoslav manual alphabet ==

Some signs are modeled after letters of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, others after Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet, or stem from other sources.

<doc id="1299122" wikidata="Q910905" url="?curid=1299122" title="Iron Man (song)">
<text>&quot;Iron Man&quot; is a song by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in 1970 from the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, and as a single in the US in October 1971.

==Background and composition==

Upon hearing Tony Iommi&#x27;s main guitar riff at rehearsal for the first time, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne remarked that it sounded &quot;like a big iron bloke walking about&quot;, with &quot;Iron Bloke&quot; quickly becoming a placeholder title as the band developed the song. Iommi had created the riff &quot;on the spot&quot; in response to a bass drum beat drummer Bill Ward started playing, creating a mood of &quot;someone creeping up on you&quot;. While recording the song, producer Rodger Bain and studio engineer Tom Allom had tremendous difficulty capturing the &quot;power and depth of the sound&quot; of his bass drum in the studio due to the limitations of the microphones available at that time.

The lyrics, composed by bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler, tell the story of a self-fulfilling prophecy in which a man travels into the future and witnesses the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present day to warn the human race, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field and is subsequently ridiculed and ignored by the people he intended to save. Feeling resentful, Iron Man retaliates by actually causing the apocalypse seen in his vision. 

Butler has been clear that there is no link between the song and the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name, explaining that he had not read American comics as a child. Rather, he took his lyrical inspiration from Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;iron bloke&quot; remark and he decided to compose the lyrics as a science fiction story. Raised in a devout Catholic family, Butler also intended the song&#x27;s subject as an allegory for Jesus Christ, but rather than forgiving his doubters and tormentors, Iron Man instead seeks vengeance. Butler recalled, &quot;I liked the Hammer horror films in the 1960s and magazines such as &quot;Man, Myth and Magic&quot;, but I had a few supernatural experiences as a child and dreams that came true and that, more than anything, shaped my interest in the occult&quot;, additionally citing H.G. Wells&#x27;s novels as inspiration. 

The effect used to create Osbourne&#x27;s distorted vocal in the song&#x27;s intro has been a topic of conjecture. Some have speculated over the years that Osbourne&#x27;s voice had been processed by a ring modulator, which had most famously been used to create the voices of the Dalek on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television program. Iommi used this effect on his guitar solo in the song &quot;Paranoid&quot; from the same album. According to Butler, a much more low-tech method was used, with Osbourne singing through an oscillating metal fan.

==Reception and legacy==
The song peaked at number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1972, becoming their highest-charting single on the chart. It also reached number 68 on the Canadian &quot;RPM Magazine&quot; Top 100. The live rendition of the song from their &quot;Reunion&quot; (2001) album won them the 2000 Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance.

&quot;Iron Man&quot; was used in the end credits of &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), as well in its video game adaptation and the trailer for the 2010 sequel, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. The character Tony Stark, alter-ego of Iron Man, also wears a Black Sabbath t-shirt in the 2012 film &quot;The Avengers&quot;. The song won spot number 317 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time as of 2004, and number 7 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; list in March 2023. &quot;Iron Man&quot; was ranked the sixth best Black Sabbath song by Rock – Das Gesamtwerk der größten Rock-Acts im Check. VH1 ranked the song as the greatest heavy metal song of all time.

The professional wrestling tag team The Road Warriors used &quot;Iron Man&quot; as their entrance theme in the mid-1980s in the American Wrestling Association and other promotions.

<doc id="1299136" wikidata="Q1343097" url="?curid=1299136" title="Pierre Lueders">
<text>Pierre Fritz Lueders (born 26 September 1970) is a Canadian Olympic, world and World Cup champion bobsledder who competed from 1990 to 2010. He piloted both two-man and four-man bobsleigh, retiring after the 2010 Winter Olympics. He was named to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Biography==
Lueders grew up in Edmonton and went to Winterburn School for elementary and junior high. He attended Jasper Place High School for grades 10 through 12.

===Competitive career===
Originally a decathlete, in 1989 he switched to bobsleigh on the advice of a cousin who was a sportswriter in what was then East Germany, who suggested his build was better suited to the latter sport. Beginning as a brakeman and progressing rapidly, he became a pilot by 1991 and in 1992 won the first World Cup race he entered.

A five-time Olympian, Lueders is the most decorated slider in Canadian history. He was the pilot of the Canadian two-man bobsleigh (teamed with Dave MacEachern) that won the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics (shared with the Italian duo of Günther Huber and Antonio Tartaglia). This was only Canada&#x27;s second-ever medal in bobsleigh, and the first since Vic Emery led his four-man crew to victory in 1964. Lueders and MacEachern ended their partnership shortly after the 1998 Games, with MacEachern attempting to make the transition to competing as a pilot in his own right: Lueders subsequently teamed up with Ken Leblanc and Giulio Zardo. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Lueders placed a disappointing fifth-place finish in two-man, and ninth in four-man, causing him to take the 2002–03 season off in four-man. At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, in the two-man event, he and his brakeman Lascelles Brown won silver despite having to contend with heavy snowfall.

Lueders also won eight medals at the FIBT World Championships with two golds (Two-man: 2004, 2005), four silvers (Two-man: 1995, 1996, 2003; Four-man: 2007), and two bronzes (Four-man: 1999, 2005).

In the Bobsleigh World Cup, Lueders won the combined men&#x27;s event four times (1993-4, 1994–5, 1997–8, 2005-6), the two-man event a record six times (1993-4, 1994–5, 1996–7, 1997–8, 2002–3, 2005-6), and the four-man event once (1994-5). Pierre Lueders has won 88 career medals in the Bobsleigh World Cup.

Lueders and his brakeman Justin Kripps made the first run down the Whistler Sliding Centre, a facility built for the 2010 Winter Olympics, on 19 December 2007. Turn 7 at the Sliding Centre, &quot;Lueders Loop&quot;, is named in his honor after he crashed out his sled during the track&#x27;s homologation in March 2008, his first crash since the 2001 Goodwill Games.

In 2010, he finished 5th in the two-man bobsleigh race. He finish 5th in the four-man bobsleigh.

===Coaching career===
Lueders retired after the Vancouver Games and was named as a national bobsleigh team development coach. He left the job in May 2012, saying he wanted a break from the sport after 22 years as an athlete and coach.

However just over a week later Lueders was appointed head coach of the Russian national bobsleigh team that would go on to win two gold medals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. He left his position as Russia coach in June 2016.

In October 2017 he became caretaker head coach for the Republic of Korea&#x27;s bobsleigh team ahead of their campaign on home ice at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In the four-man bodsleigh event, the Koreans consisting of Won Yun-jong (pilot), Seo Young-woo, Jun Jung-lin and Kim Dong-hyun tied with one of the German teams for the silver medal, the first Olympic medal won by an Asian bobsleigh team.

===Personal life===
As of 1997, Lueders resides in Calgary, Alberta. Outside of bobsledding, Lueders joined Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty as an associate in Calgary in January 2017.

<doc id="1299144" wikidata="Q41429" url="?curid=1299144" title="Gibraltar pound">
<text>The pound (sign: [[Pound sign|£]]; ISO code: GIP) is the currency of Gibraltar. It is pegged to – and exchangeable with – British pound sterling at par value. Coins and banknotes of the Gibraltar pound are issued by the Government of Gibraltar.

==History==

Until 1872, the currency situation in Gibraltar was complicated, with a system based on the real being employed which encompassed British, Spanish and Gibraltarian coins. From 1825, the real (actually the Spanish &quot;real de plata&quot;) was tied to the pound at the rate of 1 Spanish dollar to 4 shillings 4 pence (equivalent to 21.67 pence today). In 1872, however, the Spanish currency became the sole legal tender in Gibraltar. In 1898, the Spanish–American War made the Spanish peseta drop alarmingly and the pound was introduced as the sole currency of Gibraltar, initially in the form of British coins and banknotes.

In 1898, sterling coin was made sole legal tender, although the Spanish peseta continued in circulation until the Spanish Civil War. Since 1927, Gibraltar has issued its own banknotes and, since 1988, its own coins. Gibraltar decimalised in 1971 at the same time as the UK, replacing the system of 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence with one of 1 pound = 100 (new) pence.

==Relationship with the British pound==
The since repealed Currency Notes Act 1934, conferred on the Government of Gibraltar the right to print its own notes.

Notes issued are either backed by Bank of England notes at a rate of one to one, or can be backed by securities issued by the Government of Gibraltar. Although Gibraltar notes are denominated in &quot;pounds sterling&quot;, they are not legal tender anywhere in the United Kingdom. Gibraltar&#x27;s coins are the same weight, size and metal as British coins, although the designs are different, and they are occasionally found in circulation across Britain.

Under the Currency Notes Act 2011 the notes and coins issued by the Government of Gibraltar are legal tender and current coin within Gibraltar. British coins and Bank of England notes also circulate in Gibraltar and are universally accepted and interchangeable with Gibraltarian issues.

==Coins==
In 1988, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 pence and 1 pound were introduced which bore specific designs for and the name of Gibraltar. They were the same sizes and compositions as the corresponding British coins, with 2-pound coins introduced in 1999. A new coin of 5 pounds was issued in 2010 with the inscription &quot;Elizabeth II · Queen of Gibraltar&quot;. This issue caused controversy in Spain, where the title of King of Gibraltar historically corresponds to the Crown of Castile. In 2025 the Gibraltar National Mint issued the first 12-sided £1 coin, which reportedly saw high demand among collectors.
The £2 coin has featured a new design every year since its introduction, as it depicts each of the 12 Labours of Hercules.

===Tercentenary edition===

In 2004 the Government of Gibraltar minted a new edition of its coins to commemorate the tercentenary of British Gibraltar (1704–2004).

===2005 series===
In 2005, the Government of Gibraltar issued a new series of coins featuring the designs of the Tercentenary issues, being placed on different denominations. A £5 coin was issued for this series, depicting the Rock of Gibraltar.



==Banknotes==
At the outbreak of the First World War, Gibraltar was forced to issue banknotes to prevent paying out sterling or gold. These notes were issued under emergency wartime legislation, Ordinance 10 of 1914. At first, the typeset notes were signed by hand by Treasurer Greenwood, though he later used stamps. The notes bore the embossed stamp of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank Ltd. and circulated alongside British Territory notes. The 1914 notes were issued in denominations of 2/-, 10/-, £1, £5 and £50. The 2/- and £50 notes were not continued when a new series of notes was introduced in 1927. The 10/- note was replaced by the 50p coin during the process of decimalization. In 1975, £10 and £20 notes were introduced, followed by £50 in 1986. The £1 note was discontinued in 1988. In 1995, a new series of notes was introduced which, for the first time, bore the words &quot;pounds sterling&quot; rather than just &quot;pounds&quot;. The government of Gibraltar introduced a new series of banknotes beginning with the £10 and £50 notes issued on July 8, 2010. On May 11, 2011, the £5, £20 and £100 notes were issued. In 2021, the government of Gibraltar introduced a new series of banknotes in a reduced size, closely matching that of the banknotes of the Bank of England. The first note, the £5 was issued into circulation in 2021.

<doc id="1299149" wikidata="Q456206" url="?curid=1299149" title="Amazonian manatee">
<text>The Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) is a species of manatee that lives in the Amazon Basin in Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. It has thin, wrinkled brownish or gray colored skin, with fine hairs scattered over its body and a white chest patch. It is the smallest of the three extant species of manatee.

==Taxonomy==
The specific name, &quot;inunguis&quot; is Latin for &quot;nailless&quot;. The genus name &quot;Trichechus&quot;, comes from Latin meaning &quot;hair&quot;, referencing the whiskers around the manatee&#x27;s mouth.

==Physical characteristics==

The Amazonian manatee is the smallest member of the manatee family and can be distinguished by its smoother rubbery skin and lack of vestigial nails on its flippers. Ranges of body weight and size observed are and for captive males, and for captive females, and and for free-ranging manatees, respectively. The maximum actual Amazonian manatee weight reported is . Calves of the species are born weighing and long. The Amazonian Manatees increase in length approximately 1.6-2.0 mm per day. This length is measured along the curvature of the body so absolute length can differ between individuals. As calves, they gain an average of 1 kilogram per week.

Amazonian manatees are large, cylindrically shaped mammals, with forelimbs modified into flippers, no free hind-limbs, and the rear of the body in the form of a flat, rounded, horizontal paddle. The flexible flippers are used for aiding motion over the bottom, scratching, touching, and even embracing other manatees, and moving food into and cleaning the mouth. The manatee&#x27;s upper lip is modified into a large bristly surface, which is deeply divided. It can move each side of the lips independently while feeding. The general coloration is grey, and most Amazonian manatees have a distinct white or bright pink patch on the breast.

Amazonian manatees, similar to all living manatee species in the family Trichechidae, have polyphyodont teeth. Their teeth are continuously replaced horizontally from the caudal portion of the jaw to the rostral portion throughout the manatee&#x27;s life, a unique trait among mammals. Only the closest living relative of order Sirenia, elephants, show a similar characteristic of teeth replacement, but elephants have a limited set of these replacement teeth. As the teeth migrate rostrally in the manatee, the roots will be resorbed and the thin enamel will wear down until the tooth is eventually shed. Referred to as cheek teeth, differentiation of manatee teeth into molars and premolars has not occurred, and manatees additionally do not have incisors or canine teeth. These teeth migrate at a rate of about 1–2 mm/month, based on wear and chewing rates.

The Amazonian manatee lacks nails on its flippers, setting it apart from other manatees. Additionally, Amazonian manatees have a very small degree of rostral deflection (30.4°), which can be used as an indication of where in the water column the animal feeds. A small degree of deflection means that the end of the snout is straighter with regard to the caudal portion of the jaw. Animals with a greater degree of deflection, such as &quot;D. dugong&quot; at about 70° of deflection, are more of a benthic species, feed on the seafloor, and have snouts that point almost completely ventrally. Only &quot;T. senegalensis&quot; has a smaller rostral deflection of about 25.8°. This is believed to maximize the efficiency of feeding. A small degree of rostral deflection allows Amazonian manatees to feed more effectively at the surface of the water, where much of their food is found.

==Behavior and biology==
The Amazonian manatee is the only sirenian that lives exclusively in freshwater habitat. The species relies on changes in the peripheral circulation for its primary mechanism for thermoregulation by using sphincters to deflect blood flow from areas of the body in close contact with water. They also rely on subcutaneous fat to reduce heat loss.

Manatees have nostrils, not blowholes like other aquatic mammals, which close when underwater to keep water out and open when above water to breathe. Although manatees can remain under water for extended periods, surfacing for air about every five minutes is common. The longest documented submergence of an Amazonian manatee in captivity is 14 minutes.

Manatees make seasonal movements synchronized with the flood regime of the Amazon Basin. They are found in flooded forests and meadows during the flood season, when food is abundant. The Amazonian manatee has the smallest degree of rostral deflection (25° to 41°) among sirenians, an adaptation to feed closer to the water surface. It is both nocturnal and diurnal and lives its life almost entirely underwater. Only its nostrils protrude from the surface of the water while it searches river and lake bottoms for vegetation.

The Amazonian and West Indian manatees are the only manatees known to vocalize. They have been observed vocalizing alone and with others, particularly between cows and their calves.

===Diet===
The manatees themselves feed on a variety of aquatic macrophytes, including aroids (especially &quot;Pistia&quot;, &quot;water lettuce&quot;), grasses, bladderworts, hornworts, water lilies, and particularly, water hyacinths. They are also known to eat palm fruits that fall into the water. Maintaining a herbivorous diet, the manatee has a similar post-gastric digestive process to that of the horse. The manatee consumes approximately 8% of its body weight in food per day.

During the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, some populations become restricted to the deep parts of large lakes, where they often remain until the end of the dry season in March. They are thought to fast during this period, their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allowing them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.

=== Reproduction and lifecycle ===
The Amazonian manatee is a seasonal breeder with a gestational period of 12–14 months and a prolonged calving period. Most births take place between December and July, with about 63% between February and May, during a time of rising river levels in their native region. After the calf is born, it will begin to eat while staying with its mother for 12 – 18 months.

Wild individuals have a lifespan of about 30 years. The record captive lifespan is 17 years.

==Population and distribution==
As of 1977 the population count of the Amazonian manatee was estimated to be around 10,000. As of now the total population count is undetermined, however the population trend seems to be decreasing. They are mainly distributed throughout the Amazon River Basin in northern South America, ranging from the Marajó Islands in Brazil through Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. They are occasionally found overlapping with the West Indian manatee along the coasts of Brazil.

Amazonian manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, from the headwaters, in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil over an estimated seven million square kilometers. However, their distribution is patchy, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km2 They also inhabit environments in lowland tropical areas below 300 m asl, where there is large production of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants; they are also found in calm, shallow waters, away from human settlements

The Amazonian manatee is completely aquatic and never leaves the water. It is the only manatee to occur exclusively in freshwater environments. The Amazonian manatee favors backwater lakes, oxbows, and lagoons with deep connections to large rivers and abundant aquatic vegetation They are mainly solitary but sometimes they will gather in small groups consisting of up to eight individuals. They engage in long seasonal movements, moving from flooded areas during the wet season to deep water-bodies during the dry season

Natural predators include jaguars, sharks, and crocodiles.

==Illegal hunting==

The main threat to the Amazonian manatee is illegal hunting. They are hunted for subsistent and local use, not commercially. The hunting has led to the large decline in the population and low population numbers. Between 1935 and 1954, over 140,000 manatees are estimated to have been killed. Despite the laws in place against hunting, hunting continues to occur even in protected areas. Traditional harpoons are the most common weapon used against the manatees, but in Ecuador they are also known to be caught in Arapaima fish traps.

They are mainly hunted for their high value meat but the fat and skin are also used for cooking and in medicines. The meat is sold locally to neighbors or at produce markets. It can be illegally sold as sausage or mixira in public markets in Brazil and Ecuador. Mixira is a meat preserved in its own fat and is expensive which drives the hunters.

Between 2011 and 2015, 195 manatees were killed for meat in a single region of Brazil. In another region, 460 were killed in a protected area between 2004 and 2014.

==Conservation==

The IUCN red list ranks the Amazonian manatee as vulnerable. Population declines are primarily a result of hunting, as well as calf mortality, climate change, and habitat loss. However, due to their murky water habitat it is difficult to gain accurate population estimates.

There are no national management plans for the Amazonian Manatee, except in Colombia. As of 2008, the INPA takes care of 34 captive manatees and the CPPMA is caring for 31 manatees. The manatee has been protected by Peruvian law since 1973, via Supreme Decree 934-73-AG, prohibiting hunting and commercial use of the manatee.

Hunting remains the largest problem and continues in much of its range, even within reserves. In 1986, it was estimated that the hunting levels in Ecuador were unsustainable and it would be gone from this country within 10–15 years. While hunting still occurs, an increasing risk to its continued survival in Ecuador is now believed to be the risk of oil spills. The oil exploration also means an increase in boat traffic on the rivers.

The Amazonian manatees of Peru have experienced much of their decline due to hunting by human populations for meat, blubber, skin and other materials that can be collected from the manatee. Such hunting is carried out with harpoons, gillnets, and set traps. Much of this hunting occurs in the lakes and streams near the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in northeastern Peru. The species is slow-moving, docile, and is often found feeding at the surface of the lakes and rivers it inhabits. Manatees are also at risk from pollution, accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets, and the degradation of vegetation by soil erosion resulting from deforestation. Additionally, the indiscriminate release of mercury in mining activities threatens the entire aquatic ecosystem of the Amazon Basin.

<doc id="1299166" wikidata="Q698045" url="?curid=1299166" title="Sack of Magdeburg">
<text>The Sack of Magdeburg, also called Magdeburg&#x27;s Wedding () or Magdeburg&#x27;s Sacrifice (), was the destruction of the Protestant city of Magdeburg on 20 May 1631 by the Imperial Army and the forces of the Catholic League, resulting in the deaths of around 20,000, including both defenders and non-combatants. The event is considered the worst massacre of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Magdeburg, then one of the largest cities in Germany, having well over 25,000 inhabitants in 1630, did not recover its importance until well into the 18th century.

==Background==
===Archbishopric of Magdeburg===
The archbishopric of Magdeburg was established as an ecclesiastical principality in 968. In political respect the Erzstift, the archiepiscopal and capitular temporalities, had gained imperial immediacy as prince-archbishopric in 1180. This meant that the archbishop of Magdeburg ruled the town and the lands around it in all matters, worldly and spiritual.

===Protestant Reformation===
The citizens of Magdeburg had turned Protestant in 1524 and joined the Schmalkaldic League against the religious policies of the Catholic emperor Charles V in 1531. During the Schmalkaldic War of 1546/47, the Lower Saxon city became a refuge for Protestant scholars, which earned it the epithet , but also an Imperial ban that lasted until 1562. The citizens refused to acknowledge Emperor Charles&#x27;s Augsburg Interim and were besieged by Imperial troops under Maurice, Elector of Saxony in 1550/51.

====Protestant archbishops and Administrators====
The Roman Catholic archdiocese had de facto turned void since 1557, when the last papally confirmed prince-archbishop, the Lutheran Sigismund of Brandenburg, came of age and ascended to the see.

Openly Lutheran Christian William of Brandenburg, elected to be archbishop in 1598, was denied recognition by the imperial authorities. From about 1600, he styled himself Administrator of Magdeburg, as did other Protestant German notables assigned to govern principalities that were &quot;de jure&quot; property of the Catholic church.

===Alliance with the Danish king===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Administrator Christian William entered into an alliance with Denmark. In 1626, he led an army from Lower Saxony into the Battle of Dessau Bridge. After Wallenstein won this battle, Christian William fled abroad. In 1629, he fled to the court of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.

As a result of these developments, in January 1628, the Magdeburg cathedral chapter deposed Christian William and elected Augustus of Wettin, 13-year-old son of John George I, Elector of Saxony, as Administrator. Augustus did not assume office immediately due to his father&#x27;s unwillingness to provoke the emperor.

===Edict of Restitution===
In March 1629, Emperor Ferdinand II passed the Edict of Restitution. It was specifically aimed at restoring the situation of the 1555 Peace of Augsburg in ecclesiastical territories that had since strayed from &quot;legal&quot; Catholic faith and rule. Bremen and Magdeburg were the biggest examples of territories to be restituted.

===Alliance with the Swedish king===
The city&#x27;s councillors had been emboldened by King Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s landing in Pomerania on 6 July 1630. The Swedish king was a Lutheran Christian, and many of Magdeburg&#x27;s residents were convinced that he would aid them in their struggle against the Roman Catholic Habsburg emperor, Ferdinand II. However, not all Protestant princes of the Holy Roman Empire had immediately embraced Adolphus; some believed his chief motive for entering the war was to take northern German ports, which would allow him to control commerce in the Baltic Sea.

In November 1630, King Gustavus sent ex-Administrator Christian William back to Magdeburg, along with Dietrich von Falkenberg to direct the city&#x27;s military affairs. Backed by the Lutheran clergy, Falkenberg had the suburbs fortified and additional troops recruited.

====Magdeburg besieged====
When the Magdeburg citizens refused to pay a tribute demanded by the emperor, Imperial forces under the command of a Flemish mercenary, Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly laid siege to the city within a matter of months. The city was besieged from 20 March 1631 and Tilly put his subordinate Imperial Field Marshal , a Catholic convert, in command while he campaigned elsewhere. During fierce fighting, Imperial troops numbering 24,000, roughly the same number as Magdeburg&#x27;s entire population, conquered several sconces of the city&#x27;s fortification and Tilly demanded capitulation.

==Assault and sacking==
After two months of siege and despite the Swedish victory in the Battle of on 13 April 1631, Pappenheim finally persuaded Tilly, who had brought reinforcements, to storm the city on 20 May with 40,000 men under the personal command of Pappenheim. The Magdeburg citizens had hoped in vain for a Swedish relief attack. On the last day of the siege, the councillors decided it was time to sue for peace, but word of their decision did not reach Tilly in time.

In the early morning of 20 May, the attack began with heavy artillery fire. Soon afterward, Pappenheim and Tilly launched infantry attacks. The fortifications were breached and Imperial forces were able to overpower the defenders to open the Kröcken Gate, which allowed the entire army to enter the city to plunder it. The defence of the city was further weakened and demoralised when commander Dietrich von Falkenberg was shot dead by Catholic Imperial troops.

===Sacking and arson===
There are written reports of the attackers setting fire to single houses to dislodge persistent defenders. That the fire then spread all over the city appears to have been unintended. By ten o&#x27;clock most of the city was on fire. General Tilly sent some soldiers to save the cathedral, where 1,000 survivors had fled. Most of the victims in the sack suffocated or burned to death. The wind fanned the flames, further spreading the fire, in the end destroying 1,700 of the city&#x27;s 1,900 buildings.

===Out of control===
Whilst Magdeburg was razed by the fire, many Imperial soldiers supposedly went out of control. The invading soldiers had not received payment for their service and demanded valuables from every household they encountered. There were reports of rapes and torture.

Of the 25,000 inhabitants, only 5,000 survived, at least 1,000 of these having fled into Magdeburg Cathedral and 600 into the Premonstratensian monastery. Tilly finally ordered an end to the looting on 24 May, and a Catholic mass was celebrated at the cathedral on the next day. For another fourteen days, charred bodies were dumped in the Elbe River to prevent disease.

==Aftermath==
A census conducted in 1632 listed only 449 inhabitants. Much of the city remained rubble until at least 1720.

===Reactions===
After Magdeburg&#x27;s capitulation to the Imperial forces, there were disputes between residents who had favoured resistance to the emperor and those who had opposed it. King Gustavus Adolphus joined the argument, claiming the citizens of Magdeburg had not been willing to pay the necessary funds for their defence.

Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, president of the Catholic League, concluded a congratulatory letter to Tilly on 1 June with the wish that &quot;the enemies, powers and forces opposing Catholicism, the only religion offering salvation, would finally be ruined.&quot;

Pope Urban VIII wrote a congratulatory letter to Tilly on 18 June, saying: &quot;You have washed your victorious hands in the blood of sinners.&quot;

The Imperial treatment of defeated Magdeburg helped persuade many rulers to stand against the Holy Roman Emperor.

===Notoriety===
The devastations were so great that (or &quot;magdeburgization&quot;) became a common term signifying total destruction, rape and pillaging for decades. The terms &quot;Magdeburg justice&quot;, &quot;Magdeburg mercy&quot; and &quot;Magdeburg quarter&quot; also arose as a result of the sack, used originally by Protestants when executing Roman Catholics who begged for quarter.

The massacre was forcefully described by Friedrich Schiller in his 1792 work &quot;History of the Thirty Years&#x27; War&quot; and perpetuated in a poem by Goethe. A scene of Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;, written in 1939, also refers to the event.

===Political consequences===
Administrator Christian William of Brandenburg was badly injured and taken prisoner. He later converted to Catholicism and was released. He received an annual sum of 12,000 thaler from the revenues of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg under the Peace of Prague.

After the sack, the Archbishopric of Magdeburg went to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, youngest son of Emperor Ferdinand II, as the new Catholic administrator. The Peace of Prague (1635) confirmed his rule over the city, but three years later, Swedish troops expelled the Habsburg army and restored Augustus of Wettin (first elected in 1628) as Administrator as of October 1638. Augustus finally took full control of Magdeburg in December 1642 after a neutrality treaty was concluded with the Swedish general Lennart Torstenson. He was then able to begin the reconstruction of the city.

The Archbishopric of Magdeburg was secularized and ultimately fell to Brandenburg-Prussia upon Augustus&#x27; death in 1680.

<doc id="1299168" wikidata="Q1150189" url="?curid=1299168" title="Stasis dermatitis">
<text>Stasis dermatitis refers to the skin changes that occur in the leg as a result of &quot;stasis&quot; or blood pooling from insufficient venous return; the alternative name of varicose eczema comes from a common cause of this being varicose veins.

Insufficient venous return results in increased pressure in the capillaries with the result that both fluid and cells may &quot;leak&quot; out of the capillaries. This results in red cells breaking down, with iron containing hemosiderin possibly contributing to the pathology of this entity.

== Symptoms ==
Stasis dermatitis may be characterized by:
* Skin that appears thin, brown and tissue-like, with possible skin lesions (macule or patches), red spots, superficial skin irritation and/or darkening and/or thickening of the skin at the ankles or legs
* Weak skin may ulcerate in some areas and legs, ankles, or other areas may become swollen
* Open sores, ulcers
* Itching and/or leg pains
* Sometimes pain may persist from swollen tissues and may feel like &quot;stabbing&quot; or &quot;needle pricks&quot;

If skin continues to deteriorate and breaks down, a venous ulcer (also known as a stasis ulcer) may form. Without proper wound care, open cracks predispose patients for the entry of a bacterial infection, causing cellulitis in the leg.

==Diagnosis==
Stasis dermatitis is diagnosed clinically by assessing the appearance of red plaques on the lower legs and the inner side of the ankle. Stasis dermatitis can resemble a number of other conditions, such as cellulitis and contact dermatitis, and at times needs the use of a duplex ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis or if clinical diagnosis alone is not sufficient.

== Treatment ==

Treatment may consist of topical applications of steroid based creams and the use of compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression pumps, to help force the underlying buildup of fluids back out of the lower leg.

Compression therapy should consist of moderate pressures and works best for ambulating patients.

Ultimately, treating the underlying venous reflux is necessary to treat Stasis dermatitis. Invasive surgical procedures like saphenofemoral junction ligation with stripping were the norm for treatment in the past. However, less invasive methods are now more widely used. These newer methods include endovenous thermal ablation, ambulatory phlebectomy, and ultrasound foam sclerotherapy.

== Complications ==
If stasis dermatitis goes untreated, the patient is at risk of developing venous ulcers and Acroangiodermatitis.

<doc id="1299177" wikidata="Q2715241" url="?curid=1299177" title="Quercus emoryi">
<text>Quercus emoryi, the Emory oak, is a species of oak common in Arizona (including inside Saguaro National Park), New Mexico and western Texas (including inside Big Bend National Park), United States, and northern Mexico (Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila (including Parque Nacional Maderas del Carmen), Durango, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí). It typically grows in dry hills at moderate altitudes.

== Description ==
&quot;Quercus emoryi&quot; is a wintergreen tree in the red oak group, retaining its leaves throughout the winter until new leaves are produced in spring. It is a large shrub or small tree from tall. The leaves are long, simple or wavy-toothed, leathery, dark green above, paler below. The acorns are long, blackish-brown, and mature in 6–8 months from pollination; the kernel is sweet, and is an important food for people and for certain other mammals.

The seeds of this tree are called chich’il in Ndee, wi-yo:thi or toa in O’odham, bellotas in Spanish, and acorns in English. The English and Latin botanical names for this tree come from the name of a United States Army surveyor, Lieutenant William Hemsley Emory, who surveyed the area that had become known as West-Texas in the 1840s.

==Ecology==
The Emory acorn is sweet and is an important food for livestock, deer, squirrels, cliff chipmunks (&quot;Tamnias dorsalis&quot;), and birds such as quail and wild turkeys. Deer and livestock also browse the foliage.

== Uses ==
Native American groups have eaten Emory acorns traditionally, ceremonially, and in contemporary cuisine. The acorns are most commonly ground into meal.

Emory oak health and habitat have been challenged in 2020, including in Oak Flat, Arizona in the Tonto National Forest by the Resolution Copper mining company&#x27;s large copper mine.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture:Emory oak acorns are a critically important resource for Western Apache Tribal Nation, both as a food source and due to its cultural and ceremonial uses. For decades, Apache elders watched in frustration as groves produced less acorn yield and declined in overall health. The ... Emory oak Collaborative Tribal Restoration Initiative is restor[ing] and protect[ing] Emory oak stands ... to ensure the long-term persistence of Emory oak. Habitat loss, fire suppression, livestock grazing, groundwater reductions, species competition and climate change have all impacted the Emory oak population. This program uses tribal traditional ecological knowledge to guide goals and activities.

<text>The Volvo 300 Series is a rear-wheel-drive small family car sold from 1976 through 1991, both as a hatchback and (from 1984) as a conventional notchback saloon.

It was launched in the Netherlands shortly after Volvo acquired a significant stake in the passenger car division of DAF in 1973. The series consisted of the Volvo 340 (previously 343/345) and the later Volvo 360.


==Origins==
After building a series of compact cars, DAF sought a partner to bring its new larger model, codenamed P900, intended to become the DAF 77, to market in 1970. Several manufacturers were approached, including Audi, BMW and Volvo.

Due to the cost, Volvo was not initially interested, but it was later persuaded by DAF&#x27;s access to Renault engines. This helped Volvo expand its model lineup without the enormous expenditures of developing a new model. Building cars in the Netherlands also helped the Swedish Volvo to access the markets of the European Community, of which Sweden was not yet a member.

Volvo purchased a one-third share in DAF in 1973, increasing to a three-quarters stake in 1975; the DAF company&#x27;s name was changed to Volvo Car BV that year. Free of its passenger car division, The commercial vehicle division, DAF Trucks, has continued to operate under the ownership of Paccar since 1996.

==Design==
DAF had begun the development of this car in 1970 as Project P900, meant as a replacement for the DAF 66 and due to launch in 1975, probably as DAF 77. In 1971, four designs were presented anonymously to DAF employees: one by Bertone, one by Michelotti, and two by DAF in-house designers. The design by DAF&#x27;s designer John de Vries (who would later win a similar contest for the Volvo 480 design) was chosen. In 1972, Volvo bought a stake in DAF, followed by a takeover in 1975, and the design was gradually adapted to Volvo&#x27;s standards, though there were a lot of quality concerns.

The 300 series was unusual in having the gearbox mounted to the De Dion tube rear axle as a transaxle, with the 2 L models having the driveshaft enclosed in a &quot;torque tube&quot;. The rear-mounted gearbox helped with weight distribution, but resulted in an unusually large transmission tunnel, especially by comparison with the contemporary front-wheel drive competitors such as the Mk. III Ford Escort and the Opel Kadett E/Mk. II Vauxhall Astra.

Overall, the 300 series was considered heavy and often underpowered, but reliable and safe by the standards of its day. However, the 360 GLT versions were well regarded by more enthusiastic drivers, with the unusual gearbox location ensuring good weight distribution, balance, and traction. The fuel tank was located ahead of the rear axle, straddling the rear-mounted transmission, the safest possible location and one that ensured consistent handling characteristics whether the tank is full or empty.

==Model chronology==
The Volvo 343 was introduced on 19 February 1976. The introduction model was fitted with a 1.4 L Renault Cléon-Fonte engine in the front and DAF&#x27;s radical Variomatic continuously variable transmission unusually mounted in the rear, helping weight distribution. The engine was an enlarged version of those fitted to the DAF 55 and 66. To add to the car&#x27;s appeal and boost its sales, Volvo adapted the M45 manual transmission from the 200 series to fit in place of the CVT, and was sold alongside the CVT models from 1979. Volvo had also by this point substantially redesigned the interior with a much higher quality dashboard; also new seats, steering wheels and various fittings derived from the larger 200 Series model - addressing the heavy criticism of the DAF-designed interior of the early cars. A five-door model, the 345, was added in August 1979 for the 1980 model year. The extra doors added ; other modifications included better brakes, a slightly larger track due to wider wheels, and interval wipers. During 1980 larger wrap-around bumpers were introduced. In 1981, another engine option was added to the range, the Volvo designed B19, which was only available in GLS specs with the manual transmission.

A facelift in summer 1981 for the 1982 model year featured a revised bonnet, grille, front lamp arrangement, and slightly different bumpers. The interior was revised, and the cars received a new dashboard more aligned with other Volvo models. Overall length was increased to .

The third digit designating the number of doors was dropped from model designations starting with the 1983 model year. The rear seat also gained a little more space thanks to a shallower seat pad and a flatter plate beneath it. The more powerful 360 arrived that year with two 2.0 L engine choices, Volvo&#x27;s B19A (360 GLS) and the fuel injected B19E. The B19A was also available in the 340 DL. The more powerful 360 GLT was only available with a five-speed manual and the engine came equipped with a breakerless ignition system and velour interior, amongst other comfort details. The 360 GLT can be recognized by its front spoiler with integrated extra lights, a rear spoiler, and by being lower. The 360s were four-cylinders and not sixes as implied by the name; the &quot;360&quot; name was used to &quot;give the new model a stronger profile in the Volvo range.&quot; This 2.0 L 360 model was available in five-door and three-door hatchback form, with four-door &quot;notchback&quot; saloon models added in 1984. Trim levels were GL, GLE, or GLT, depending on output and specifications.

In 1985, the 300 Series received a significant facelift. Other changes were (optionally body-coloured) wrap-around bumpers with integrated turn signal lights. The taillights were also redesigned. Instrumentation changed from Smiths units to VDO. The older Volvo &quot;redblock&quot; engines in the 360 were upgraded to the low-friction B200 unit. Capacities and outputs remained much the same. The carburetor version was designated B200K, and the Bosch LE-Jet fuel-injected version is known as the B200E.

A famous advertisement for the 300 series in the late 1980s saw a crash test dummy &quot;come alive&quot;, and drive a 340 out of a second-floor factory window, nose-diving into the concrete ground.

From 1987 on, incremental improvements in features and emissions control were made. The newly designed power steering from the new Volvo 480 became available as an option for the 1988 model year, while rust protection was improved with the increased use of galvanised steel. Production of the 360 came to an end in 1990, while the 340 was discontinued in 1991, despite the fact it had supposedly been replaced by the Volvo 440 in 1987. The last car of the Volvo 300 series (a white Volvo 340) rolled off the production line on 13 March 1991, three years after the launch of the 400 series.

==Engines==
The 300 Series had a choice of three petrol engines: a 1.4, 1.7, and a 2.0 L. The 1.4 L B14 was a Renault C-series OHV pushrod unit, and for the 360 there was the B200 (originally the earlier B19 version) 2.0 L engine taken from the Volvo 240 with outputs varying from to . A new Renault F-series 1.7 L petrol engine (designated the B172) was introduced in the 340 during the summer of 1985, following the range facelift, along with a 340 version of the saloon, which was only available with the new engine. There was also a catalyzed version (B172K) available later on, with .

A diesel engine for the 340 developing , was only available in select export markets and was added to the 340 models in 1984. This diesel was a Renault F-series (like the petrol 1.7), and was available with a 1.6 L naturally aspirated engine only - called the &quot;D16&quot; in Volvo&#x27;s internal jargon. While these diesel models were never offered in the UK, they were marketed with right-hand drive in Ireland. In 1985, a 360 diesel with the same mechanics was made available. The diesel was discontinued in 1989, when a 1.3 L &quot;tax special&quot; was introduced for Finland, Italy, and Belgium. Volvo also experimented with LPG tanks, a feature available in 1979 with the Volvo 343 and 345, but with limited LPG availability, sales were negligible.

==Sales==

The 300-series was a strong seller for Volvo. Sales began at a low level, not helped by the absence of a manual transmission option and an early reputation for poor build quality. Still, sales gradually increased as the lineup expanded with manual transmission and a 5-door body style, and the initial quality issues were solved - by redesigning the interior and dashboard. 300-series cumulative production broke 100,000 units on 12 December 1983, with the total reaching 102,000 before the end of the year. The 100,000th car, finished in white, was donated to the Dutch Red Cross.

In 1988, 12 years after its introduction, the one-millionth 300 was built. Finished inside and out in red, it ended up in the DAF museum in Eindhoven. Eventually, the production of the 300 series ended in 1991 after 1.14 million units, averaging 76,000 vehicles per year.

While the car was fundamentally robust, the vehicle was rushed to production too early. In particular the first (1976) model year 343 suffered from teething problems, with unsubstantiated claims that Volvo ordered its dealer network to scrap early model year cars that were traded in, to remove them from circulation. As a result, few 1976 and 1977 cars survived. The build quality gradually improved, but was never up to the same standard as Volvo&#x27;s larger models. Due to this bad reputation, the car was not popular in Sweden. Sales of the 340 with Variomatic in Sweden were down to 200 per year in the late 1980s. The 300&#x27;s sales were also limited because the price of a 2.0 L 360 was more than a base 240 in the home market.

===Markets===
While not a major sales success, the Volvo badge ensured that the car had a strong middle-class following (often as a second car) in some places, particularly in the UK in the 1980s. It regularly made it onto Britain&#x27;s top annual 20 sales tables for that decade and was the best-selling import car at several points in the early 1980s. They are robust and mechanically simple (and therefore easy to maintain). Variomatic transmissions are reliable if given proper care. The rust protection was poorer than that of other Volvos, but the engines were durable. In February 2016, it was reported that 627 examples of the 300 Series were still in use on Britain&#x27;s roads.

Up to 1982, sales of the 300-series were almost entirely limited to Western Europe. In the years following, exports to other parts of the world slowly expanded with 4% of total sales in 1984.
In 1985, CKD-kits of the Volvo 340 GL were sent to Indonesia and CKD-kits of the Volvo 360 GLE were sent to Malaysia for assembly.

The Volvo 300-series was not sold in North America. Only the 360GLT was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 1984 and exported until 1988.

==Models and special editions==
The 300 series was available in different trim levels throughout its production. There were also special editions.

Phase 1 343s and 345s were available in DL, GL, DLS, and GLS trim levels, while Phase 2 and 3 340s and 360s were available in the following range of trim levels: 340; 340DL; 340GL; 340GLE; 340 DLS; 340GLS; 340 Blueline; 340 Redline; 360; 360GL; 360DLS; 360GLS; 360GLE; 360GLT. No market received all models.

One such variation on a theme was the 1981 343 R-Sport. This was intended as a sporty offering to the lineup, pre-dating the introduction of the 360GLT by some two years. Only 100 cars were produced based on the DLS and GLS trim levels and featuring sporting additions such as self-adhesive &#x27;R-Sport&#x27; decals, rev counter, front and rear spoilers, as well as some featuring body-coloured bumpers and alloy wheels. The B19A engine also featured some modifications, including twin Solex carburetors. Power was increased from a quoted 95HP to 122HP (90 kW).

A similar model was the 1979 343 Oettinger. This model was based on the standard 343 DL, with the 1397 cc capacity increased to 1596 cc. It was modified by the VW Group tuning company Oettinger and released in 1979. The 343 Oettinger was available in red or silver metallic. A total of 125 cars were produced.

A van version also entered production. The van was essentially a five-door 340, but the rear doors were replaced with full body-coloured metal pieces, and the rear seats were removed. A glazed version was also available. The cargo compartment has a flat floor and a metal bulkhead behind the front seats to protect occupants from moving loads. It was called &quot;Volvo 345 Van&quot; and was developed for commercial use at the behest of the Dutch Postal Services, who preferred a Dutch-made vehicle. It was first presented at a commercial vehicle show in Amsterdam in February 1982 and offered to the public. The only engine was the petrol &quot;B14&quot;, combined with either the CVT or a four-speed manual.

The Millionaire edition was introduced in 1988 to commemorate the production of the one-millionth car in the 300 series. This edition featured all options on both the 340 GLE and 360 GLE/T, including air conditioning, electric front windows and mirrors, alloy wheels, and a leather interior.

==Prototypes==
There are variations of the Volvo 300 series that never made production:

The Volvo 340 estate and a convertible were built for design studies, but neither was produced. The convertible version of the Volvo 340 was mooted and only exists as a clay model.

The 363 CS was short for &#x27;Competition Services&#x27;, to indicate a high-performance version. The 1977 363 CS was based on the three-door bodyshell and fitted with the B27F 2.7 L V6 PRV engine used in the Volvo 260 series. The gearbox was a five-speed Alfa Romeo unit, as Volvo did not have a suitable design to fit a transaxle design. One prototype was built, painted in metallic silver with black and orange stripes down both sides. Flared wheel arches and orange-painted, multi-spoke alloy wheels were also added.

At the 1979 Geneva Motor Show, Bertone presented a three-door hatchback coupé concept on 343-basis called the Volvo Tundra. The angular design was by Marcello Gandini and continued the themes developed for the Reliant (Anadol) FW11.

==In motorsport==
The 300-series was campaigned in motorsport. A heavily modified version using Alpine/Gordini cross-flow engines bored out to 1770 cc was driven by Per-Inge Walfridsson to win the European Championship of Rallycross in 1980. The cars gained homologation for rallying in Sweden&#x27;s Standard-B class (minimum weight of 15 kg/ps) in the spring of 1977, with some minor modifications to the engine and gearing. In the UK, several Volvo 360 GLT models can be seen in action on road-rally events.

The Volvo 360 GLT also participated in a 24-hour endurance record-breaking run at the Surfers Paradise raceway in Queensland, Australia, to showcase the introduction of the model in Australia in 1984. This same Volvo 360 GLT was later converted to rallying specifications and participated in many Australia rally events and is still running in 2009 as a rally car.

<text>OMV (formerly abbreviation for Österreichische Mineralölverwaltung Aktiengesellschaft ()) is an Austrian multinational integrated oil, gas and petrochemical company which is headquartered in Vienna, Austria. The company is listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. In the 2021 Forbes Global 2000, OMV Group was ranked as the 413th largest public company in the world.

It is active in the oil and gas upstream and downstream businesses as well as in petrochemicals and plastics recycling.

==History==
The history of OMV began on 3 July 1956, when the company then known as &quot;Österreichische Mineralölverwaltungs Aktiengesellschaft&quot; was officially entered into the commercial register. Consequently, the Soviet Mineral Oil Administration (&quot;Sowjetische Mineralölverwaltung&quot;, SMV), a corporation formed during the Soviet zone of occupation in post-war Austria became &quot;Österreichische Mineralölverwaltungs Aktiengesellschaft&quot;.

Four years later, in 1960, the company opened the Schwechat refinery near Vienna, in 1968 the first natural gas supply contract with the former USSR were entered.
At the end of 1987, 15% of OMV was privatized, making it the first public listing of a state-owned company in Austria. In 1990 the company opened its first filling station in Vienna on 26 June.
In 1998, OMV acquired a 25% stake in the plastics group, Borealis.

The International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) of Abu Dhabi acquired an initial 19.6% interest in the group at the end of 1994. The following year, the group changed its name from &quot;ÖMV&quot; to &quot;OMV&quot; because the umlaut on the &quot;Ö&quot; is not commonly used in many languages.

In the early 2000s, OMV expanded into Eastern Europe, by acquiring around 10% of Hungarian oil company, MOL and in 2003 it acquired the upstream division of Germany&#x27;s Preussag Energie, expanding its filling station networks.

In 2004, OMV became the market leader in Central and Eastern Europe following the acquisition of 51% of Romanian oil and gas group Petrom which then constituted the largest acquisition in OMV&#x27;s history.
In the same year, OMV increased its share capital, meaning that more than 50% of the company&#x27;s shares were in free float for the first time. Following the sale of 50% of the subsidiary company Agrolinz Melamine International GmbH to IPIC in 2005, the Borealis group was taken over in full together with IPIC.

In 2006, OMV acquired a 34% stake in a Turkish oil company Petrol Ofisi. In the same year, the board members of OMV and Verbund, the Austrian utility group announced plans for a merger. However, this collapsed due to resistance from Austrian MPs.

OMV increased its stake in Hungarian oil group MOL to 20.2% in 2007. OMV then sold its entire stake in March 2009 after MOL rejected a takeover bid in 2008 and the European Commission imposed tough restrictions for an approval of the deal. In late 2011, OMV acquired the stake held by Dogan Holding in Petrol Ofisi, which further increased its stake in the company to 95.75%.

In 2012, the Domino-1 well in the Romanian Black Sea exploration license Neptun was the most significant discovery in that year, which has the potential to be OMV&#x27;s most important gas discovery ever.

On 31 October 2013, the acquisition deal with Norwegian Statoil containing participations in oil and gas fields and in development projects in Norway and the UK was closed. With US$2.65 billion, this then was the largest transaction in OMV&#x27;s history.

A divestment agreement for the 45% stake in Bayernoil was signed in December 2013. The sale was closed in June 2014.

In 2015 OMV increased its interest in Petrol Ofisi to 100%. Two years later, in 2017, OMV sold Petrol Ofisi to Vitol Group

==Controversies==

===War crimes in Sudan===
In June 2010, the European Coalition on Oil in Sudan (ECOS) published the report &quot;Unpaid Debt&quot;, that called upon the governments of Sweden, Austria, and Malaysia to look into allegations Lundin Petroleum (as operator), OMV and Petronas may have been complicit in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity whilst operating in Block 5A, South Sudan (then Sudan), during the period of 1997 to 2003. The reported crimes include indiscriminate attacks and intentional targeting of civilians, burning of shelters, pillage, destruction of objects necessary for survival, unlawful killing of civilians, rape of women, abduction of children, torture, and forced displacement by government troops. When the consortium that OMV took part in operated in Block 5A, approximately 12.000 people died and 160.000 were violently displaced by government troops from their land and homes, many forever. Satellite pictures taken between 1994 and 2003 show that the activities coincided with a spectacular drop in agricultural land use in its concession area.

In June 2010, the Swedish public prosecutor for international crimes opened a criminal investigation into links between Sweden and the reported crimes. In 2016, Lundin Petroleum&#x27;s Chairman Ian Lundin and CEO Alex Schneiter (as operator) were informed that they were the suspects of the investigation. Sweden&#x27;s Government gave the green light for the Public Prosecutor in October 2018 to indict the two top executives On 1 November 2018, the Swedish Prosecution Authority notified Lundin Petroleum AB that the company may be liable to a corporate fine and forfeiture of economic benefits of SEK 3,285 (app. €315 million) for involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity. Consequently, the company itself would also be charged, albeit indirectly, and will be legally represented in court. On 15 November 2018 the suspects were served with the draft charges and the case files. They would be indicted for aiding and abetting international crimes and may face life imprisonment if found guilty. The trial is likely to open early in 2022 and may take two years.

The Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities. In May 2016, representatives of communities in Block 5A claimed their right to remedy and reparation and called upon OMV, Lundin Petroleum and Petronas and their shareholders to pay off their debt to them. A conviction in Sweden may provide some level of remedy and reparation for the few victims of human rights violations who will testify in court, but not for the other 200,000 victims who will not be represented in court. The Swedish court cannot impose obligations upon OMV.

On 23 May 2019, the T.M.C. Asser Institute for International Law in The Hague organized the conference &#x27;Towards criminal liability of corporations for human rights violations: The Lundin case in Sweden&#x27;.

OMV endorses the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, acknowledging the duty of business enterprises to contribute to effective remedy of adverse impact that it has caused or contributed to. The company has never publicly showed an interest in the adverse impacts of its activities on the communities in its concession area. According to the Dutch peace organisation PAX, the companies OMV, Lundin Petroleum, Petronas, as well as their shareholders are disregarding the human rights standards that they claim to respect, notably the OECD Guidelines and UN Guiding Principles, because they,
&quot;A&quot;. never conducted an appropriate due diligence for their Sudanese operations;
&quot;B&quot;. made no effort to know their human rights impacts; and
&quot;C&quot;. do not show how they address alleged adverse human rights impacts.

OMV (Sudan) Exploration GmbH was a wholly owned subsidiary of OMV AG, and held a 26.1% share in the a license as part of the consortium that appointed Lundin as operator to explore and develop oil deposits in Block 5A. It sold its Sudanese assets in 2004 with a net profit of $55 million As the operator of the consortium, Lundin Petroleum was responsible for day-to-day management but its managers stood under the supervision of the Operating Committee, that exercised &quot;overall direction and control of all matters pertaining to the Joint Operations and the Joint Property&quot;. OMV was permanently represented in the Operating Committee and has never publicly distanced itself from any of its decisions.

Between 2001 and 2003, OMV met repeatedly with European human rights advocates led by Sudan Platform Austria, but the company took no effective measures to prevent involvement in human rights violations or undo the adverse impact of Lundin&#x27;s operations. On 6 April 2001, OMV wrote to Human Rights Watch: &quot;We have reached the conclusion that, despite problems, the influx of oil revenues could improve the social and humanitarian conditions of the Sudanese. Oil exploration activities also represent immediate benefits to the local population, in terms of employment, infrastructure developments and humanitarian assistance... Our role is to constantly monitor the situation on the ground and to turn our perception of business ethics into reality by responsible action. In 2002, OMV nevertheless commissioned an independent report on the human rights situation in Block 5A, that has not been made public.

While Block 5A was operated by Lundin, OMV was a participant in the consortium, the suspicions against the consortium&#x27;s top managers therefore also concern OMV. The Austrian State&#x27;s owns 31% of OMV&#x27;s shares. According to the UN Guiding Principles, which is endorsed by Austria, an abuse of human rights by a business enterprise that is wholly or partially controlled by a State, may entail a violation of that State&#x27;s own international law obligations.

===Petrom===
The acquisition of 51% stake in Petrom was considered controversial as the privatisation contract was not made public and it consists of several disputed clauses.

The privatisation allegedly produced a market monopoly. Critics say that OMV can use the resources Petrom owns until their exhaustion. Also fixing of tax for gas and oil exploration at 3 to 13.5 percent from the final delivery price for 10 years was criticised. Some critics claimed, that the price €1.5 billion was too low.

On 13 December 2022, OMV Petrom was convicted by the Couter of Justice from Gaiesti, Romania of Involuntary manslaughter case. The Local Court Gaiesti ruled its decision in the file where OMV Petrom SA was sent to trial for involuntary manslaughter. The accusation is referring to an incident which occurred in Cobia in 2016 and resulted in the death of a child.
OMV Petrom was found guilty and was convicted to a punishment of a criminal fine amounting to RON 28,000. On the civil side, the court assessed the degree of fault of OMV Petrom SA at 50% and the company was obliged to pay moral damages in total amount of EUR 135,000 to the victim&#x27;s family and material damages and other expenses in total amount of RON 22,000. The court ordered the complementary measure consisting in the one-year suspension of the activity of oil exploitation wells within the radius of Dâmboviţa county which, at the date when the decision becomes final, do not have a completely closed and locked perimeter or which do no have a well cellar grate installed. The court also ordered the publication of the decision of conviction, in extract. .

===MOL===
In June 2007 OMV made an unsolicited bid to take over MOL, which was rejected by the Hungarian company. MOL criticised OMV&#x27;s advertisement in which OMV had suggested the two had already worked together on the European market. MOL thought that to be misleading and unethical and asked OMV to remove the name MOL from those advertisements. OMV dismissed its bid after negative results of the investigation by the European competition authorities.
OMV sold its entire stake to Surgutneftegas in March 2009.

===New Zealand===
On 10 April 2019 OMV announced that it would drill up to ten wells off the Otago, New Zealand coast. The decision was met with indications by local environmental groups, who had successfully fought previous attempts to drill for fossil fuels in the area, that OMV could &quot;expect resistance&quot;. In November 2019 an OMV supply vessel in Timaru was occupied for 57 hours by 27 protesters, and 16 people were arrested. In March 2020 two members of Extinction Rebellion Ōtautahi intercepted and boarded an OMV mobile drilling rig in the Marlborough Sounds from an inflatable boat, intending to occupy it for a week, but due to sickness of one of the protestors, the occupation was abandoned after 14 hours. The protestors came on board of the rig and were flown to New Plymouth and served with a trespass notice.

<doc id="1299203" wikidata="Q7132335" url="?curid=1299203" title="Papa Haydn">
<text>The composer Joseph Haydn is sometimes given the nickname &quot;Papa&quot; Haydn. The practice began in Haydn&#x27;s lifetime and has continued to the present day.

 identifies three senses of the term, discussed below in the order of their chronological origin.

==&quot;Papa&quot; as a term of affection==
&quot;Papa Haydn&quot; started out as a term of affection bestowed on Haydn by the musicians who worked for him. After 1766 Haydn was the Kapellmeister at the Esterházy court, presiding over a fairly large group of musicians. His authority was evidently rather benevolent, as he often interceded with Prince Esterházy on behalf of musicians who had gotten in trouble. The tale of the &quot;Farewell&quot; Symphony attests to Haydn&#x27;s willingness to act on behalf of his subordinates. The practice of calling Haydn &quot;Papa&quot; became increasingly plausible as Haydn&#x27;s 30-plus years of service in the Eszterházy court went by; with each year, he would have become increasingly older than the average musician serving under him.

As time went by, the group of musicians who called Haydn &quot;Papa&quot; expanded beyond the Esterházy court and included Haydn&#x27;s friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Höslinger summarizes this aspect of &quot;Papa Haydn&quot; thus: &quot;&#x27;Papa&#x27; arose as a term of affection, commonly used by the Esterházy players ... for a father figure, somebody who willingly gave advice and who was generally respected as a musician.&quot; He notes that in Haydn&#x27;s time the term was used for other musicians as well; e.g. &quot;Franz Schubert called Salieri his &#x27;Grosspapa&#x27; (German: &#x27;grandad&#x27;)&quot;.

==&quot;Papa&quot; as founder==
Another sense of the term &quot;Papa Haydn&quot; came from his role in the history of classical music, notably in the development of the symphony and string quartet. While Haydn did not invent either genre, his work is considered important enough that the labels &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot; and &quot;Father of the String Quartet&quot; are often attached to him. Even in his own lifetime, this perspective was prevalent. In 1797, the Tonkünstler-Societät of Vienna passed the resolution to make him a life member, &quot;by virtue of his extraordinary merit as the father and reformer of the noble art of music.&quot; When in 1798 Franz Niemetschek published a biography of Mozart, he dedicated the book to Haydn, calling him &quot;father of the noble art of music and favorite of the Muses.&quot;

Höslinger asserts that this usage of &quot;Papa Haydn&quot; increased during the 19th century, &quot;as the sense of reverence for older composers increased.&quot;

==&quot;Papa&quot; as pejorative==
This usage, which arose in the 19th century, is characterized thus by Höslinger: it is &quot;a more patronizing, even dismissive one. In comparison with Romantic artists and Romantic music, Haydn and his output were seen as genial, but naive and superficial.&quot;

With the rise of acclaim for Haydn&#x27;s music during the 20th century, the patronizing sense of &quot;Papa Haydn&quot; caused scholars and critics to become leery of the term, seeing it as a distortion of the composer&#x27;s work. For example, Haydn scholar Jens Peter Larsen wrote (1980):

&quot;Papa Haydn&quot; was used in a children&#x27;s song, sung to the first bars of the second movement of the &quot;Surprise Symphony&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
Papa Haydn&#x27;s dead and gone
but his memory lingers on.
When his mood was one of bliss
he wrote jolly tunes like this.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1299208" wikidata="Q5719262" url="?curid=1299208" title="Henry Cecil Raikes">
<text>Henry Cecil [[Raikes]] PC (18 November 1838 – 24 August 1891) was a British Conservative Party politician. He was Chairman of Ways and Means between 1874 and 1880 and served as Postmaster General between 1886 and 1891.

==Background and education==
Born in Chester, Cheshire, Raikes was the grandson of Reverend Henry Raikes, Chancellor of the Diocese of Chester, and the great-grandson of Thomas Raikes, a merchant and banker in London, who was Governor of the Bank of England and a personal friend of prime minister William Pitt the Younger. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political career==
Raikes was Member of Parliament for Chester between 1868 and 1880, for Preston in 1882 and for Cambridge University between 1882 and 1891. He served as Chairman of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations from 1869 to 1874. In 1874 he was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means (Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons), a post he held until 1880, when he was sworn of the Privy Council. He later returned to party political life when he served as Postmaster General under Lord Salisbury between 1886 and 1891.

Raikes is one of the earliest British politicians to have had their voice recorded. George Edward Gouraud recorded him on behalf of Thomas Edison on the evening of 5 October 1888 at his home in Upper Sydenham near Crystal Palace, London.

==Family==
Raikes married Charlotte Blanche, of Plas Teg, Mold, daughter of Charles Blayney Trevor-Roper, on 26 September 1861. They had several children, including Cecil Dacre Staveley Raikes (1874–1947), a Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy, and Henry St John Digby Raikes, father of the Conservative politician Sir Victor Raikes. The family lived at Llwynegrin Hall, Wales. Raikes died on 24 August 1891, aged 52. Charlotte Raikes survived her husband by over 30 years and died in September 1922.

<doc id="1299225" wikidata="Q1048866" url="?curid=1299225" title="William Glasser">
<text>William Glasser (May 11, 1925 – August 23, 2013) was an American psychiatrist. He was the developer of W. Edwards Deming&#x27;s workplace ideas, reality therapy and choice theory. His innovations for individual counseling, work environments and school, highlight personal choice, personal responsibility and personal transformation. Glasser positioned himself in opposition to conventional mainstream psychiatrists, who focus instead on classifying psychiatric syndromes as &quot;illnesses&quot; and prescribe psychotropic medications to treat mental disorders.

Based on his wide-ranging and consulting clinical experience, Glasser applied his theories to broader social issues, such as education, management, and marriage, to name a few. As a public advocate, Glasser warned the general public of potential detriments caused by older generations of psychiatry, wedded to traditional diagnosing of patients as having mental illnesses (brain disorders) and prescribing medications. In his view, patients simply act out their unhappiness and lack of meaningful personal connection with important people in their life. Glasser advocated educating the general public about mental health issues; offering, post-modern frameworks for finding and following healthy therapeutic direction.

==Early life and career==
Glasser was born on May 11, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ben Glasser, a watch and clock repairman, and his wife Betty. He attended Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where in 1945 he earned his BS in chemical engineering. After a short career as an engineer, Glasser returned in 1946 to Case Western, but instead, during his first semester, was drafted into the US Army and stationed at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. He returned to Case Western in 1947, earning his MA in clinical psychology in 1949 and his MD in psychiatry in 1953. He completed his medical internship and psychiatric residency at UCLA and the Veterans Administration Hospital, respectively, and became board certified in 1961.

After being &quot;thrown off the staff&quot; at the VA hospital due to his anti-Freudian beliefs, Glasser took a position as staff psychiatrist at the Ventura School for Delinquent Girls, where he began teaching ideas that became the basis for reality therapy. During this time, Glasser met G. L. Harrington, an older psychiatrist who openly disbelieved the Freudian model of mental illness, whom Glasser credits as being his &quot;mentor&quot;.

Glasser set up a private psychotherapy practice in Los Angeles, which he maintained until 1986.

==Work==
Glasser authored and co-authored numerous and influential books on mental health, counseling, school improvement, and teaching, and several publications advocating a public health approach to or emphasis within mental health versus the prevailing &quot;medical&quot; model.

Glasser founded the Institute for Reality Therapy in 1967, which was renamed the Institute for Control Theory, Reality Therapy and Lead Management in 1994 and later the William Glasser Institute in 1996 in Chatsworth, CA. The institute is now located in Tempe, Arizona, and has branch institutes throughout the world.

By the 1970s Glasser called his body of work &quot;Control Theory&quot;. By 1996, the theoretical structure evolved into a comprehensive body of work renamed &quot;Choice Theory&quot;, mainly because of the confusion with perceptual control theory by William T. Powers, developed in the 1950s.

==Reality therapy organizations==

In the United States, the Glasser Institute was originally organized with regional groups in New England, the Sunbelt, the Northwest, the Midwest, the Southeast, and the West Coast.

In July 2010 the William Glasser Association International (WGAI) was established in Nashville, Kentucky, with an interim governing board charged with setting up the organization to coordinate worldwide activities and conferences, the first of which was in 2012 in Los Angeles. The board eventually became incorporated in California under the new name of William Glasser International (WGI) and is the umbrella body recognised by Glasser to represent his ideas around the world. The members of the WGI Board are elected by members.

Outside of the United States, William Glasser International (WGI) has active affiliate organizations in many countries including Canada, Croatia, Slovenia, Ireland, the UK, Finland, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Central and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Neither WGI nor its affiliate organisations confer titles such as &quot;counsellor&quot; or &quot;therapist&quot; in their regular certification courses. In Europe, however, there are two special courses offering by the European Institute for Reality Therapy, one leading to the title Reality Therapy Psychotherapist and the other to obtain the title Reality Therapy Counsellor. Both can lead to The European Certificate in Psychotherapy (ECP).

The William Glasser Institute UK (formally Institute for Reality Therapy UK), with its own administration executive, coordinates the faculty workshops and practicums in the United Kingdom on behalf of WGI International, leading up to and including Reality Therapy Certification (CTRTC). The WGI UK strives to promote and develop choice theory, reality therapy, and lead management in the UK, offering guidance and support to its membership made up of a body of like-minded individuals, committed to their own personal and professional advancement. Support is offered by a team of training and practicum supervisors. Members of the institute subscribe to the &quot;ethos&quot; that Choice Theory, Reality Therapy, and Lead Management guide and support their relationships both on a personal and professional basis, and that Reality Therapy should be taught with integrity and adherence to fundamental concepts as described by Glasser and others who write, teach, and are associated with WG International.

==Death==
Glasser died at his home in Los Angeles on August 23, 2013, in the company of his wife, Carleen, and others. Glasser&#x27;s obituary reported the cause of death as respiratory failure stemming from pneumonia. The William Glasser Institute website referred to Glasser&#x27;s death as &quot;a massive shock to all&quot;, despite him having been &quot;in poor health for some time&quot;.

<doc id="1299249" wikidata="Q303563" url="?curid=1299249" title="Lærdal Tunnel">
<text>The Lærdal Tunnel () is a road tunnel connecting the municipalities of Lærdal and Aurland in Vestland county, Norway; the southwest end of the tunnel is approximately northeast of Bergen. It carries two lanes of European Route E16, and was the final link completing the main highway that now enables car travel between Oslo and Bergen with no ferry connections and no difficult mountain crossings during winter. It is the longest road tunnel in the world, the second being WestConnex in Sydney, Australia.

In 1975, the Parliament of Norway decided that the main road between Oslo and Bergen would run via Filefjell. In 1992, Parliament confirmed that decision, added that the road should run through a tunnel between Lærdal and Aurland, and passed legislation to build the tunnel. Construction started in 1995 and the tunnel opened in 2000. It cost 1.082 billion Norwegian kroner ($113.1M USD).

Beginning in 2025 and for around four years, the tunnel will be completely closed for fourteen hours each night for upgrades to meet recent changes to EU safety regulations. Alternative routes such as road 50 are available, but are slower and often closed in winter.

==Design==
A total of of rock was removed from the tunnel during its construction from 1995 to 2000. The tunnel begins just east of Aurlandsvangen in Aurland, goes under a mountain range, and ends south of Lærdalsøyri in Lærdal. Its design takes into consideration the mental strain of driving through a long tunnel; it is divided into four sections, separated by three large mountain caves (with parking areas available) at intervals. While the main tunnel has white lights, the caves have blue lighting with yellow lights at the fringes to give an impression of sunrise. These caves are meant to break the monotony, providing a refreshing view and allowing drivers some relief. They are also used as turnaround points, and as break areas to help alleviate claustrophobia during the 20-minute drive through the tunnel. In the tunnel, there are signs every kilometer indicating how many kilometers have already been covered and how many still to go. To alert drivers who become inattentive or start to fall asleep, each lane is supplied with a loud rumble strip towards the centre.

===Safety===
The tunnel does not have emergency exits; however, there are many safety precautions in case of accident, fire, or other emergency. Emergency phones marked &quot;SOS&quot; are installed every for contacting police, fire departments, and hospitals. Fire extinguishers are placed every . Whenever an emergency phone is used or a fire extinguisher is lifted, stop lights and electronic signs reading (English: turn and exit) are displayed throughout the tunnel, and electronic signs at the entrance show (English: tunnel closed). There are fifteen turnaround areas that accommodate buses and semi-trailers. In addition to the three large caverns, emergency niches have been built every . There are photo inspections; security centres in Lærdal and Bergen keep a count of all vehicles entering and exiting the tunnel. Wiring is installed so that radios and mobile phones do not lose service while inside the tunnel. Speed cameras have been installed because of serious speeding. There are very few other completely straight roads in the region.

===Air quality===
High air quality in the tunnel is achieved in two ways: ventilation and purification. The Lærdal Tunnel is the first in the world to be equipped with an air treatment plant, located in a -wide cavern about northwest of Aurlandsvangen. Air from the tunnel is drawn into the plant by two large fans, particulates (dust and soot) are removed by an electrostatic filter, and nitrogen dioxide is removed by a large carbon filter. In addition, large ventilation fans draw fresh air in through both entrances, and air from the middle of the tunnel is expelled through a ventilation shaft to Tynjadalen.

<doc id="1299268" wikidata="Q899177" url="?curid=1299268" title="Brazilian Highway System">
<text>The Brazilian Highway System (Portuguese: &quot;Sistema Nacional de Rodovias&quot;) is a network of trunk roads administered by the Ministry of Transport of Brazil. It is constructed, managed and maintained by the National Department of Transport Infrastructure (DNIT), a federal agency linked to the Ministry of Infrastructure, and the public works departments of state governments. 

The National Travel System (Portuguese: &quot;Sistema Nacional de Viação –&quot; SNV) comprises the road infrastructure and the operational structure of the different means of transporting people and goods. As for jurisdiction, the national road system is composed of the Federal Road Traffic System (Portuguese: Sistema Federal de Viação – SFV) and the road systems of the States, the Federal District and the Municipalities.

The Investment Partnership Program (PPI) is a major effort to expand and upgrade the network of highways aside with the Federal Highway Concessions Program (PROCROFE). The Ministry of Infrastructure often uses a public–private partnership model for highway maintenance, and toll-collection. Currently, the longest National Highway in Brazil is BR-116 with .

== Characteristics ==


, the system consists of of roads, of which approximately are paved (12.4%), and about are divided highways, only in the State of São Paulo. Currently it is possible to travel from Rio Grande, in the extreme south of the country, to Brasília () or Casimiro de Abreu, in the state of Rio de Janeiro (), only on divided highways. The total of paved roads increased from 35,496 km (22,056 mi) in 1967 to 215,000 km (133,595 mi) in 2018, with an expansion of 0.5% between 2009 and 2019. In 2009, Brazil had of paved road and of unpaved road per inhabitant. 

In 2019, the Federal Highway System had , of which approximately were paved (86.3%), and was under federal concession (PROCROFE). The most important federal highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116.

Although Brazil has the largest duplicated road network in Latin America, it&#x27;s considered insufficient for the country&#x27;s needs: in 2021, it was calculated that the ideal amount of duplicated roads would be something around from to . The main road axes also have problems because they often have inadequate geometry and constructive characteristics that don&#x27;t allow quality long-distance flow (non-interference from local traffic and high speed).

The Brazilian Federal Government has never implemented a National Highway Plan at the same level as developed countries such as the USA, Japan or European countries, which specifically aimed at inter-regional travel, and which should preferably be served by highways. The Brazilian State, despite some planning efforts, has been guided by a reactive action to the increase in demand (only duplicating some roads with old and inadequate layout) and not by a purposeful vision, directing occupation and economic density in the territory. Another problem is the lack of directing the Union Budget towards infrastructure works, since there is no law that guarantees funds from the Federal Budget for works on highways and other modes of transport, depending exclusively on the goodwill of the rulers.

Brazil even invested 1.5% of the country&#x27;s budget in infrastructure in the 1970s, being the time when the most investment was made in highways; but in the 1990s, only 0.1% of the budget was invested in this sector, maintaining an average of 0.5% in the 2000s and 2010s, insufficient amounts for the construction of an adequate road network. For comparative purposes, the average investment of the USA and the European Union was 1% between 1995 and 2013, even though they already have a much more advanced road infrastructure than Brazil.

The country still has several states where paved access to 100% of the state&#x27;s municipalities has not yet been reached. Some states have 100% of cities with asphalt access, such as Santa Catarina, which reached this goal in 2014; Paraíba, which reached this goal in 2017, and Alagoas, which reached this goal in 2021. In states like Rio Grande do Sul, in 2020, there were still 54 cities without asphalt access. In Paraná, in 2021, there were still 4 cities without asphalt access. In Minas Gerais, in 2016, there were still 5 cities without asphalt access.

As it is in the United States, Canada, and most countries in Europe, larger/wider highways have higher speed limits than normal urban roads (typically between and ), although minor highways, unpaved highways and sections of major highways running inside urban areas have a lower speed limit in general. The national speed limit for cars driving in non-urban roads is unless otherwise stated, regardless of the road design, weather or daylight.

==Nomenclature==

Brazilian Regional highways are named YY-XXX, where YY is the abbreviation of the state where the highway is running in and XXX is a number (e.g. SP-280; where SP means that the highway is under São Paulo state administration).

Brazilian National highways are named BR-XXX. National highways connect multiple states altogether, are of major importance to the national economy and/or connect Brazil to another country. The meaning of the numbers are:

*000-099 - it means that the highway runs radially from Brasília. It is an exception to the cases below.
*100-199 - it means that the highway runs in a south–north way
*200-299 - it means that the highway runs in a west–east way
*300-399 - it means that the highway runs in a diagonal way. Highways with odd numbers run northeast–southwest, while even numbers run northwest–southeast.
*400-499 - it means that the highway interconnects two major highways.
*600-699 - it is a special designation given to highways of national importance but that just interconnect a highway to an important location. There currently are only two such highways in the country, BR-600 which connects the Itaipu Dam to BR-277 and BR-610 which connects the Guarulhos International Airport to BR-116 and SP-070.

Often Brazilian highways receive names (famous people, etc.), but continue to have a YY/BR-XXX name (example: Rodovia Castelo Branco is also SP-280).

See highway system of São Paulo for numbering designation for São Paulo state roads, also used in some other states.

==Major Federal Brazilian Highways==
===BR-010===
The BR-010 is a radial highway that connects the national capital Brasília, to the city of Belém, in the state of Pará. It has the official name of Rodovia Bernardo Sayão (the name of its chief engineer, who died in an accident during the construction of the highway, when a tree fell on him), and is also called Belém–Brasília Highway or as Transbrasiliana Highway, in the stretch between the city of Estreito, in the state of Maranhão, and the city of Belém. This is due to the fact that between Brasília and Estreito, the highway has many incomplete and unpaved stretches, especially in the state of Tocantins. Between Brasília and Estreito, the original route of the Belém-Brasília Highway follows the BR-060, the BR-153 and the BR-226 highways, which are completely paved in this stretch. The BR-010 passes through the Federal District, and the states of Goiás, Tocantins, Maranhão and Pará.

===BR-020===

The BR-020 connects Fortaleza in Ceará to the federal capital Brasília. Like other BRs that start with the number 0, it leaves Brasília to an extreme point in Brazil. The highway is important because passes through the MATOPIBA region (in the south of Piauí and in the west of Bahia), which is an important producer of soybeans, corn and cotton, among other products. It connects the interior of the Northeast to the Port of Mucuripe, in Fortaleza.

===BR-040===
BR-040 runs radially from near the national capital Brasília (beginning 100 km south of the beginning of BR-050, in Brasília), in a northwest–southeast way, to Rio de Janeiro city.

BR-040 is the modern way of the so-called &quot;Caminho Novo&quot;, opened in the 18th century that linked Ouro Preto, the main center of gold mines of Minas Gerais to the Rio de Janeiro harbor.

In 1861 the road was paved from Petrópolis to Juiz de Fora, becoming the first road paved in Latin America until the 1920s. In 1928, Petrópolis was connected to Rio de Janeiro with a paved road.

In the 1930s the route was changed to pass by the new capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, although it was unpaved until 1957, when the road was extended to Brasília, the new capital of Brazil.

From 1951 to 1973 BR-040 was called BR-3 and was famous for its dangerous bends, such as the Viaduto das Almas, near Belo Horizonte, disabled in 2010. In the 1970s the part from Rio de Janeiro to Juiz de Fora was modernized and became a two-laned road.

Cities where the BR-040 runs or passes by: Luislândia, Belo Horizonte, Juiz de Fora, Rio de Janeiro.

===BR-050===

BR-050 runs radially from the national capital, Brasília, in a north–south way, to Santos city, passing in São Paulo. It&#x27;s one of the most important highways in the country: being close to being fully duplicated in 2021, it passes through some of the richest regions of Brazil. It links areas of large agricultural and industrial production to Port of Santos, the largest in the country. Brasília is the city with the highest average salary per inhabitant. Goiás is one of the largest national producers of sugarcane, soy, corn and tomatoes, in addition to having a large cattle ranching. The area between Uberaba and Uberlândia, in Minas Gerais, has the largest milk production in Brazil. The state of São Paulo holds 30% of Brazil&#x27;s industrial GDP and a gigantic agricultural sector. In Ribeirão Preto there is the largest production of sugarcane in the world. In Franca, there is the largest national production of men&#x27;s shoes. The highway also drains the gigantic production of coffee from Minas Gerais and orange juice from São Paulo. In the area around Campinas there is a great technological production. 40% of the cars produced in the country come from the cities of Greater São Paulo. Not to mention the production of chicken meat and all industrial production in São Paulo, which is basically exported via Santos.

===BR-060===

This road connects Brasília to Bela Vista, on the Paraguayan border. The highway is important because helps in the flow of agricultural production in the Center-West Region, which specializes in: soybeans, corn, sugarcane, tomatoes, beans, in the planting of eucalyptus for the production of cellulose and paper, and in cattle raising. Goiás and Mato Grosso do Sul also have considerable mineral exploration, producing a lot of iron ore, nickel and copper, in addition to gold, manganese and niobium. The BR-060 will in the future serve as a link with the Bioceanic Corridor that is being built with 3 other South American countries, connecting Campo Grande to Antofagasta, passing through Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile.

===BR-101===

BR-101 runs in a north–south way, along Brazil&#x27;s eastern coast. It is Brazil&#x27;s second major highway, and the longest in the country (nearly long). It connects more states capitals than any other &quot;rodovia&quot; in the country, in the total, 12 capitals are directly connected by BR-101. It&#x27;s considered one of the most important highways in the country, along with BR-116: as it is a highway with a trans-coastal nature, it allows the connection between ports, major consumer centers and tourist areas. Used both by tourists who explore the coast, and for the transport of local and regional road loads such as those destined for or coming from ports and industries.

The Rio–Niterói Bridge is part of the BR-101.

Cities where the BR-101 runs or passes by: Natal, João Pessoa, Olinda, Recife, Maceió, Aracaju, Feira de Santana, Itabuna, Ilhéus, Porto Seguro, Linhares, Vitória, Guarapari, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Barra Mansa, Santos, Curitiba, Joinville, Florianópolis, Criciúma, Osório.

===BR-116===

BR-116 runs in a north–south way, near, but not on Brazil&#x27;s coastline. It is considered one of the most important highways in the country, along with BR-101. It&#x27;s also the second longest of the country, although, in practice, it is currently the one with the greatest extension built (). The highway is one of the main connections for the transport of loads, receiving thousands of trucks every day. Numerous parts of the long path taken by the BR-116 have other official names, such as Régis Bittencourt, Presidente Dutra, Santos Dumont, among others. 

Cities where the BR-116 runs or passes by: Fortaleza, Salgueiro, Feira de Santana, Vitória da Conquista, Teófilo Otoni, Governador Valadares, Rio de Janeiro, Volta Redonda, São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Curitiba, Lages, Caxias do Sul, Canoas, Porto Alegre, Pelotas.

===BR-153===

Also known as Transbrasiliana Highway, as Belém–Brasília Highway or even as Bernardo Sayão Highway, the BR-153 is one of the longest highways in South America and runs in the north–south direction, connecting the city of Marabá, in the state of Pará, and the city of Aceguá, in the boundary with Uruguay. It passes through the states of Pará, Tocantins, Goiás, Minas Gerais (Triângulo Mineiro region), São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. The BR-153 is one of the main highways of the central region of Brazil, mainly in the states of Goiás and Tocantins, and also in the Triângulo Mineiro region. The highway works as an important channel for the flow of agricultural production (mainly soy, corn, sugar cane, cotton and tomato) and livestock (mainly beef and pork) in the Midwest, transports milk production from Minas Gerais and coffee from São Paulo, and agricultural products (rice, wheat, barley, soybeans, corn, grapes, apples, oats), livestock (chicken, pork, fish, and milk) and industrial (furniture, footwear, textiles, machinery, etc.) of the Southern region.

===BR-277===

BR-277 runs east–west, starting from the Friendship Bridge, which connects Brazilian city Foz do Iguaçu to Paraguayan Ciudad del Este, and going up to the port city of Paranaguá. It is approximately 650 km long. The highway is of great economic importance for both Brazil and Paraguay, as it connects the Brazil-Paraguay border to the Port of Paranaguá (which exits into the Atlantic Ocean). 

It is one of the most important highways in the Southern Region of Brazil, as it connects Curitiba (the capital city of the state of Paraná and the third highest city GDP in Brazil) to the city of Paranaguá and to the international border city of Foz de Iguaçu, one of the most-frequented touristic destinations in Brazil (mainly due to border trade, to the presence of the Iguaçu Falls and the Itaipu Dam). In Paraná, there is a large production of soybeans, corn, chicken, milk, cellulose and fish, among other products, which are exported through the Port of Paranaguá (among other international connections). 

For Paraguay, BR-277 is also of economical significance as it has a direct connection with Asunción through Route PY-02 and serves as an exit to the Atlantic Ocean. On the Brazil-Paraguay border there is intense trade between the two countries. and Paraguay uses the port to carry out part of its exports through the Atlantic Ocean.

Major Brazilian cities connected by BR-277 are Foz do Iguaçu, Medianeira, Cascavel, Guarapuava, Ponta Grossa, Curitiba, and Paranaguá.

===BR-369===
BR-369 begins in Oliveira, Minas Gerais and ends in Cascavel in the state of Paraná. 

This highway is of extreme economical importance as it is used to transport products from agriculture, livestock and industry from the states of Paraná to São Paulo and vice versa - for example, soy, corn, coffee, beef, paper and cellulose, wood, furniture and other important products in the region. It also connects the western states of Paraná and São Paulo to Paraguay. Paraguay imports most of the products it consumes from Brazil (one of the main promoters of the Paraguayan economy). Therefore, trade and tourism with Paraguay are strong in the region. Foz do Iguaçu and Ciudad del Este benefit directly from the highway.

===BR-376===

The road connects the cities of Garuva, in the state of Santa Catarina, to Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul. It has a length of 958,3 km. The road is very important to transport agricultural, livestock and industrial products from the states of Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul. As some examples, we have soy, corn, coffee, beef, paper and cellulose, wood, furniture and other important products. in the region.

===BR-386===

This highway connects Canoas (in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul) with the municipality of Iraí (in the extreme northwest of the state, on the border with Santa Catarina). 

It&#x27;s called the Production Highway due to its high importance for the state. Through it all the production of soy, corn, wheat, meat, wood, furniture, among other products of the region is drained. In the city of Ametista do Sul, close to Iraí, there is the largest production of amethyst in the world. Close to Lajeado is one of the largest productions of tobacco on the planet. In Santa Catarina, the highway ends near Chapecó, the largest regional hub in the west of the state. In general, cities with significant GDP are on the side of the highway.

<text>What We Did on Our Holidays (released as Fairport Convention in the United States) is the second studio album by the English folk rock band Fairport Convention, and the first of three released in 1969. It was their first album to feature singer-songwriter Sandy Denny. The album also showed a move towards the folk rock for which the band became noted, including tracks later to become perennial favourites such as &quot;Fotheringay&quot; and the song traditionally used to close live concerts, &quot;Meet on the Ledge&quot;.

==History==
Following the departure of Judy Dyble, the band conducted auditions for a replacement singer, and Sandy Denny became the obvious choice. Simon Nicol has said &quot;it was a one horse race really... she stood out like a clean glass in a sink full of dirty dishes&quot;. According to author Richie Unterberger Denny&#x27;s &quot;haunting, ethereal vocals gave Fairport a big boost&quot;.

The album has been described by Unterberger as &quot;a near-ideal balance between imaginative reworkings of traditional folk songs ... quality covers of contemporary folk-rock singer-songwriters, some quite obscure ... and original folk-rock material by various members&quot;. In 2008 Simon Nicol described the album as his favourite, and it was voted number 281 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

The cover features a sketch of the band performing, drawn on a blackboard by Martin Lamble and Sandy Denny in a classroom at the University of Essex 
 and the reverse of the original sleeve shows a photograph of the band performing. The Island Masters 1990 re-release IMCD 97 also features a portrait of Sandy Denny.

In the US, the album was released by A&amp;M Records (SP-4185) with an identical track listing but featuring new cover art, and was re-titled &quot;Fairport Convention&quot;. The album was also released in Australia and New Zealand by Festival Records with the &#x27;blackboard&#x27; front cover and an entirely different back cover to both the US and UK releases. The Discogs website gives no fewer than 54 different versions of the album.

==Reception and influence==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, American critic Robert Christgau deemed Fairport Convention the &quot;most interesting unknown group&quot; he had listened to in some time, highlighting their take on &quot;Pentangle-style ballads&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot;. Neal Casal, of Ryan Adams &amp; the Cardinals, later listed &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot; as one of his favourite albums of all time.

Reviewing the 2008 re-issue of the album Pitchfork.com said: &quot;The album mixes new interpretations of traditional ballads like &#x27;Nottamun Town,&#x27; here rendered almost as a raga, with much newer songs, such as their soulful take on Dylan&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;ll Keep It With Mine&#x27; and their ponderous version of Mitchell&#x27;s &#x27;Eastern Rain.&#x27; The best material on &quot;Holidays&quot;, though, may be their own—the stomping blues-rock of &#x27;Mr. Lacey,&#x27; the racing &#x27;No Man&#x27;s Land,&#x27; and the stirring afterlife anthem &#x27;Meet on the Ledge.&#x27;&quot;

== 1999 album ==
The album title was re-used for the 1999 CD release &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays – An Introduction to Fairport Convention&quot; on Island Records as IMCD 263.

<text>Sir Robert de Ros ( – ) was an Anglo-Norman feudal baron, soldier and administrator who was one of the twenty-five barons appointed under clause 61 of Magna Carta to monitor its observance by King John of England.

==Origins==
Born about 1182, he was the son and heir of Everard de Ros (died before 1184) and his wife Roese (died 1194), daughter of William Trussebut, of Warter. Robert &quot;Farfan&quot; had a sister Alice, who married William II de Percy, 3rd feudal baron of Topcliffe (d. 1174/5), and left two daughters Maud and Agnes as co-heiresses. The Ros family, from the village of Roos in Yorkshire, had in 1158 acquired the barony of Helmsley, also in Yorkshire, and before 1189 by gift of King Henry II the barony of Wark on Tweed in Northumberland.

==Career==
Left fatherless, his lands were initially in the keeping of the Chief Justiciar of England, Ranulf de Glanvill. In 1191, though under age, he paid a 1,000-mark fee to inherit his father&#x27;s lands. In that year he also married a widow who was an illegitimate daughter of King William I of Scotland. Later he inherited from his mother one-third of the Trussebut estates, which included lands near the town of Bonneville-sur-Touques in Normandy, of which he became hereditary bailiff and castellan.

In 1196, during fighting between King Richard I of England and King Philip II of France, Richard captured a French knight worth a significant ransom and put him in the castle of Bonneville. When the keeper of the castle let the knight escape, an angry Richard had the man hanged and imprisoned Ros, fining him 1,200 marks (though he was later let off 275 marks).

Like many magnates, he had an uneasy relationship with King John after 1199. He witnessed the King&#x27;s charters, served in his armies, went on diplomatic missions for him (one in 1199 to Ros&#x27;s father-in-law in Scotland), and on one occasion was reported gambling with him in Ireland. Tension arose in 1205, when John ordered his lands to be seized but later relented. It was possibly then that his younger son was taken as a hostage by the King.

In 1206 he was given permission to mortgage his lands if during the next three years he went to Jerusalem, as a crusading knight or as an individual pilgrim. The permission was renewed in 1207, but his record was marred by the escape that year of another prisoner under his supervision, for which he was fined 300 marks. Back in favour in 1209, he was sent again on a diplomatic mission to Scotland but does not seem to have gone to Palestine, for in 1210 he was serving with John in Ireland.

In 1212, on account of him entering a monastic order, John gave custody of his lands to Sir Philip Oldcoates. But he re-entered secular life the next year, when the King made him sheriff of Cumberland and appointed him to a commission investigating grievances in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In the latter county, he worked for a reconciliation between John and William de Forz, heir to the extensive estates there of Hawise, Countess of Aumale.

In October 1213 he was one of the witnesses when John surrendered England to the authority of the Pope and he was one of the twelve guarantors appointed to ensure John kept his promises. Throughout the disturbances of 1214 and the first quarter of 1215 he remained loyal to John, being rewarded with royal manors in Cumberland and royal support for the election of his aunt as abbess of Barking Abbey. However he then joined the rebel barons as one of the 25 chosen to enforce observance of Magna Carta, being appointed by them to control Yorkshire and possibly Northumberland. For this he was excommunicated by the Pope, and John gave his lands to William de Forz.

Ordered by John to give up Carlisle Castle, he did so but remained on the rebel side after the death of John in October 1216, supporting Prince Louis even after his elder son was captured by the loyalist side in May 1217. He finally submitted later that year, and regained most of his lands. Intermittent unrest in Yorkshire continued, with fighting in 1220 between his men and those of the sheriff, followed in 1221 with him being summoned to help take and destroy Skipsea Castle during the rebellion of William de Forz.

In 1225 he was one of the witnesses to the reissue of Magna Carta and by the end of 1226 had re-entered a monastic order, possibly the Knights Templar. His Helmsley estates, where he had fortified the castle, then went to his elder son, while Wark, also fortified by him, went to the younger. He died that year, or in 1227, and was buried in the Temple Church in London.

==Benefactions==
He was a supporter of the Knights Templar, giving them lands in Yorkshire that included Ribston, where they set up a commandery. At Bolton in Northumberland, he founded a leper hospital dedicated to St Thomas Becket, endowing it with extensive lands. He was also a benefactor of Rievaulx Abbey, Newminster Abbey and Kirkham Priory.

==Family==
Early in 1191, at Haddington near Edinburgh, he married Isabella, widow of Robert III de Brus and illegitimate daughter of William I &quot;the Lion&quot;, King of Scotland. Her mother was said to be a daughter of Robert Avenel.

Their children included:

*William (died about 1265), of Helmsley, whose wife was named Lucy, and their son was Robert (died 1285).
*Robert (died about 1270), of Wark, who married Christina, daughter of William Bertram, of Mitford, and their son Robert (died about 1274) was his heir.

<text>Everard de Ros (c. 1145 - c. 1183) was the lord of Hamlake (now known as Helmsley).

==Life==
Originally a ward of Ranulph de Granville, he seems to have been wealthy as in 1176 he paid the then large sum of five hundred twenty-six pounds as a fine for his lands, and other large amounts subsequently. He was the son of Robert de Ros and Sybil de Valoines. Everard de Ros married Rose Trusbut (in 1170 or 1171) with whom he had two sons, the oldest of which, Robert de Ros, became a Magna Carta surety. After 1170-71, he assumed the arms of Trussebut of Warter.

==Death==
He died around 1186; he and his wife (both apparently great benefactors to various religious institutes) are buried in the church of Hunmanby.

<text>Marten Toonder (2 May 1912 – 27 July 2005) was a Dutch comic strip creator. He was probably the most successful comic artist in the Netherlands and had a great influence on the Dutch language by introducing new words and expressions. He is most famous for his series &quot;Tom Puss&quot; and &quot;Panda&quot;.

==Life==
Toonder was born in Rotterdam on 2 May 1912, in Rotterdam. He lived in Ireland from 1965 until the early 1990s. He was married to the cartoon artist Phiny Dick (1912–1990), who collaborated with her husband and on whose earlier created characters Ollie B Bumble and Tom Puss were based. In 1996, at the age of 84, he married the composer Tera de Marez Oyens, who died the same year. Together with his brother, author , he assisted his father, (Captain) Marten Toonder Sr., a seaman born in the Dutch northern province Groningen, to write a book about his life, in which Toonder Sr. describes many details about the closing era of professional cargo sailing, the Rotterdam Lloyd (Line to East Indies), the Holland America Line, and about pre-war Rotterdam.

Marten Toonder died in his sleep on 27 July 2005, aged 93, in Laren, North Holland.

==Tom Puss/Oliver B. Bumble series==

In 1931, after his final exams, Marten Toonder went to Buenos Aires with his father. Here he got acquainted with the work of the well-known Argentine artist and editor Dante Quinterno, who ran a studio producing comics. Quinterno&#x27;s creations impressed him to such a degree that he decided to become an artist himself. His most famous comic series were the Tom Puss (&quot;Tom Poes&quot; in Dutch) and Oliver B. Bumble (&quot;Olivier B. Bommel&quot; in Dutch) series that appeared in a Dutch newspaper from 1941–86. It has a very characteristic format. Every day there were three drawings and an accompanying text (about a book-page long). It started out as a children&#x27;s cartoon, but gradually became more relevant to adults. Nowadays his texts are considered literature by some critics, and Toonder received several literary prizes for them. He invented many new words and expressions and some of those are now widely used in the Dutch language. Many personalities in his comics have their own peculiar dialect of Dutch, for instance Prlwytzkofsky language of professor Prlwytzkofsky, an innovative mixture of Dutch and German. Due to this emphasis on language play, Toonder&#x27;s work is difficult to translate. His drawing style is very detailed and might be compared to &quot;Pogo&quot;, with more room for background drawings, since there are no text balloons in the drawings. Apart from his eccentric use of language Toonder is also praised for satirical approach.

<text>Paysandu Sport Club, commonly referred to as Paysandu, is a Brazilian professional club based in Belém, Pará founded on 2 February 1914. It competes in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, the second tier of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Paraense, the top flight of the Pará state football league.

==History==
On February 2, 1914, members of Norte Club protested against a decision of the football federation of Pará benefiting Remo by terminating the team and refounding another team. Unanimously, the assembly chose Hugo Leão to chair the meeting. As the leader of the movement, he proposed the name of Paysandu Football Club for the new club. The name was chosen as a tribute to the unfortunate event in Paysandú, an Uruguayan city, which would take the start of the war against Paraguay.

That year, the Norte Club held a good campaign and needed to beat Guarany to force an extra match against Grupo do Remo. After the match finished in a draw, the members of the Norte Club asked the Pará state League to cancel the match due to various irregularities. However, the league board dismissed the appeal. The decision did not please members of the Norte Club, who then started a movement, under the leadership of Hugo Leão, for the foundation of a stronger, new association. This movement bothered the members of Grupo do Remo, who tried to persuade Hugo Leão to abandon the idea.

In February 1914, the newspaper &quot;O Estado do Pará&quot; made the call for the meeting of a new club. The call by the newspaper had a large effect, causing 42 athletes to attend the meeting, many of whom had been part of the Norte Club, in addition to other different associations. With the name now decided, the assembly elected the first president, Deodoro de Mendonça. The committee to draft the Statutes of the club was also chosen, with the ones elected being: Deodoro de Mendonça, Eurico Amanajás and Arnaldo Morais. The second meeting was held on February 10, 1914 at the same location of the first. More than 15 new members joined Paysandu, with the number of members being increased to 100 and all of them considered founding partners. At the third meeting, on February 19, 1914, Paysandu&#x27;s status was revised from &quot;Foot-Ball&quot; to &quot;Sport Club&quot; after a vote in the assembly, with the aim of requesting Paysandu&#x27;s affiliation within the Pará State League. So Paysandu Sport Club was officially founded on February 2, 1914.

In 1991 and 2001, Paysandu was the champion of Série B. In 2002 the club was champion of Copa Norte, and later, champion of Copa dos Campeões, beating powerhouse Palmeiras in the semi-finals, and then edging Cruzeiro on penalties after a 5-5 draw on aggregate, prequalified them as cup winners to the 2003 Copa Libertadores. Paysandu also won the Campeonato Paranaense that year, for a record third consecutive year. 

Despite winning three trophies that year, in the 2002 Serie A Paysandu struggled, finishing 20th and only two points from relegation. The following season was very similar, with the club struggling in the league, and only avoiding relegation through goal difference. 

However, the 2003 Copa Libertadores was much different. This was Paysandu&#x27;s first participation in the competition, and they began by finishing the group stage undefeated (four wins and two draws), including a famous 6-2 victory over Cerro Porteño in Paraguay. In the round of 16, the club was faced with powerhouse Boca Juniors, who eventually won the competition and then the Intercontinental cup. In the first leg at La Bombonera, Paysandu won 1-0 with a goal from Iarley. Boca came back and won the second leg 4-2 in Belém, eliminating the Brazilians. Their 2004 Série A campaign was a lot better, with the club finishing comfortably in mid table, even though they started the season winless in the first nine matches. However in the 2005 Série A the team was relegated, finishing second to last and losing 25 out of 42 games, the most of any team that season. In 2006 the club was relegated from Serie A, until reaching promotion back to the second division in 2012. Since then, the club has been yoyoing between Serie B and C. 

The club also has four titles of the Copa Verde, as well as being the largest state winners with a record 50 titles.

==Symbols==

===Crest===
The crest is blue and white, with the initials PSC, in reference to the name Paysandu Sport Club. At the bottom, there is a winged foot. Crest creator Mário Bayma explained its meaning: &quot;The team&#x27;s goal of speed would never be equaled or surpassed by its opponents, because it would reach the limit of the flight.&quot; Above the shield are three stars, two silver stars symbolizing the Série B titles of 1991 and 2001, and one gold star (central) symbolizing the title of Copa dos Campeões in 2002.

===Anthem===
The official anthem of Paysandu was composed in 1916 by the poet José Simões, while the music was made by Professor Manuel Luís de Paiva. There is also the &quot;popular&quot; hymn, composed by Francisco Pires Cavalcanti, excited about the victory of Paysandu against Peñarol in 1965, which is better known than the official team anthem.

=== Traditional home kit ===

The uniform was proposed by Hugo Leão, first president of Paysandu, at the meeting held on February 10, 1914. The proposal was only approved by the general assembly, by unanimous vote of the members, on February 19, 1914, seventeen days after the foundation of the club. The uniform follows the same model to the present day.

==Rivalries==
Paysandu&#x27;s biggest rival is Remo, with whom it plays the &quot;Clássico Rei da Amazônia&quot; (Amazon King derby) or &quot;Re-Pa.&quot; The first game took place on 14 June 1914, with Remo winning 2–1. On 26 July 1945, the biggest score in the derby took place. Paysandu won 7–0 in a match valid for the Campeonato Paraense of that year. In 2016, the derby was declared intangible cultural heritage of the Pará state, being qualified as a cultural expression of the people of Pará.

A further minor rivalry exists between Paysandu and Tuna Luso. The first match happened on 11 December 1932, a friendly that ended tied at 3–3.

==Stadium==
Paysandu&#x27;s stadium is Curuzu, which has a maximum capacity of 16,200 people. Mangueirão also held several Paysandu matches, such as Copa Libertadores matches and Campeonato Brasileiro matches against high-profile clubs.

<text>BBC Japan was a short-lived subscription television channel co-owned by BBC Worldwide and SKY PerfecTV! subsidiary Japan Mediarc that was available via satellite in Japan. The channel&#x27;s aim was to showcase the BBC&#x27;s programming to the Japanese market, but it suffered from financial issues from its co-owner that led to the channel&#x27;s closure a year later.

==History==
The channel was announced by the BBC on 8 October 2004 for a launch on 1 December. The channel launched as planned on that day, broadcast on Sky PerfecTV! satellite channel 110. The channel launched with solid figures, with reports at the BBC citing that the audience was mainly Japanese. On 14 June 2005, the channel was added to Online TV Company&#x27;s IPTV service.

On 20 March 2006, BBC Worldwide announced that the channel would cease operations in April, citing that financial problems at Japan Mediarc meant they could no longer honour contractual commitments to distribute the network. On 24 April 2006, the closure date of 30 April was announced, and the channel closed as planned on that day.

==Programming==
Being the Japanese counterpart to BBC Prime, BBC Japan aired programmes normally sourced from BBC Worldwide or the mainstream BBC archives, as well as third-party content from companies like Granada Media. With BBC Japan being a commercial network; programs were edited to fit the time slot, meaning a normal hour-long production would be shortened to 42 minutes on the channel.

While some shows were dubbed or voiced over, the majority of the channel&#x27;s content was broadcast in English with Japanese subtitles.

<doc id="1299303" wikidata="Q1632711" url="?curid=1299303" title="Huaca del Sol">
<text>The Huaca del Sol is an adobe brick pyramid built by the Moche civilization (100 AD to 800 AD) on the northern coast of what is now Peru. The pyramid is one of several ruins found near the volcanic peak of Cerro Blanco, in the coastal desert near Trujillo at the Moche Valley. The other major ruin at the site is the nearby Huaca de la Luna, a better-preserved but smaller temple.

By 450 AD, eight different stages of construction had been completed on the Huaca del Sol. The technique was additive; new layers of brick were laid directly on top of the old, hence large quantities of bricks were required for the construction. Archeologists have estimated that the Huaca del Sol was composed of over 130 million adobe bricks and was the largest pre-Columbian adobe structure built in the Americas. The number of different makers&#x27; marks on the bricks suggests that over a hundred different communities contributed bricks to the construction of the Huacas.

The Huaca del Sol was composed of four main levels. The structure was expanded and rebuilt by different rulers over the course of time. It is believed to have originally been about 50 meters in height and 340 m by 160 m at the base. Located at the center of the Moche capital city, the temple appears to have been used for ritual, ceremonial activities and as a royal residence and burial chambers. Archaeological evidence attests to these functions.

During the Spanish occupation of Peru in the early 17th century, colonists redirected the waters of the Moche River to run past the base of the Huaca del Sol in order to facilitate the looting of gold artifacts from the temple. The operation of the hydraulic mine greatly damaged the Huaca del Sol. In total, approximately two-thirds of the structure has been lost to erosion and such looting. The remaining structure stands at a height of 41 meters (135 feet).

Looting and erosion due to El Niño continue to be major concerns to this day.

<doc id="1299306" wikidata="Q602056" url="?curid=1299306" title="Antonio Francesco Grazzini">
<text>Antonio Francesco Grazzini or Antonfrancisco Grazzini (March 22, 1503February 18, 1584) was an Italian author.

==Biography==
He was born at Florence or in Staggia Senese (he wrote of himself: &#x27;) of a good family, but there is no record of his upbringing and education. He probably began to practise as an apothecary as a youth; and owned the then famous Farmacia del Moro near the Cathedral. In 1540 he was among the founders of the Accademia degli Umidi, which was soon renamed Accademia Fiorentina. He later took a leading role in the establishment of the more famous Accademia della Crusca, which published his &quot;Vocabulario&quot; of words accepted as the purest Italian. To both societies he was known as Il Lasca or Leuciscus, a pseudonym which is still frequently substituted for his proper name.

Grazzini was temperamental, his life consequently enlivened or disturbed by various literary quarrels. His Umidi brethren expelled him for a time, because of his ruthless criticism of the Arameans, a party of academicians led by Giambattista Gelli who maintained that the Florentine language was derived from Hebrew, Aramaic, or some other branch of the Semitic. He was readmitted in 1566, when his friend Salviati was consul.

II Lasca ranks as one of the great masters of Tuscan prose. His style is flexible and abundantly idiomatic, but without affectation. It has the force and freshness of popular speech, whilst retaining a flavour of academic culture.

==Main works==
*&quot;Le Cene&quot; (1549), a collection of stories in the manner of Boccaccio, and a number of prose comedies. One of the stories is &quot;The Story of Doctor Manente&quot;, translated and with an introduction by D.H. Lawrence (G. Orioli, 1929).
*&quot;La Spiritata&quot; (1561)
*&quot;I Parentadi&quot;
*&quot;La Arenga&quot;
*&quot;La Sibilla&quot;
*&quot;La Pinzochera&quot;
*&quot;L&#x27;Arzigogolo&quot;

A number of miscellaneous poems, a few letters and &quot;Four Orations to the Cross&quot; complete the list of Grazzini&#x27;s works.

He also edited the works of Francesco Berni, and collected &quot;Tutti I trionfi, larri, mascherate o canti carnascialeschi, andati per Firenze dal tempo del Magnifico Lorenzo vecchio de &#x27;Medici fino all&#x27;anno 1559&quot; (the latter influenced Goethe&#x27;s &quot;&quot;). In 1868 Adamo Rossi published in his &quot;Ricerche per le biblioteche di Perugia&quot; three novelle by Grazzini, from a manuscript of the 16th century in the Comunale of Perugia; and in 1870 a small collection of those poems which have been left unpublished by previous editors appeared at Poggibonsi, &quot;Alcune poesie inedite&quot;.

<text>The Lužnice (; ) is a river in the Czech Republic and Austria, a right tributary of the Vltava River. It flows through Lower Austria and the South Bohemian Region. It is long, of which is in the Czech Republic, making it the 11th longest river in the Czech Republic.

==Etymology==
The name of the river is derived from the Czech word &quot;luh&quot; (i.e. &#x27;riparian forest&#x27;), meaning &quot;the river that flows through riparian forests&quot;. The first written mention of the river is from 1179.

==Characteristic==

The Lužnice originates in the territory of Bad Großpertholz in the Gratzen Mountains at an elevation of and flows to Hosty, where it enters the Vltava River at an elevation of . It is long, of which is in the Czech Republic. About of the river forms the Austrian-Czech border. Its drainage basin has an area of , of which is in the Czech Republic.

The longest tributaries of the Lužnice are:
==Flow==
The most notable settlement on the river is the town of Tábor. The river originates in the territory of Bad Großpertholz (Austria), then it crosses the Austrian-Czech border and flows through Pohorská Ves, then it returns to Austria and flows through Sankt Martin, Weitra and Unserfrau-Altweitra before it creates the Austrian-Czech border between the territories of Gmünd and České Velenice.

After that, the river definitely turns north into the Czech Republic and flows past the towns of Suchdol nad Lužnicí, Třeboň, Veselí nad Lužnicí, Soběslav, Planá nad Lužnicí, Sezimovo Ústí, Tábor (where the river turns back to the southwest), Bechyně and Týn nad Vltavou.

==Bodies of water==

The Lužnice flows through the Třeboň Basin, which is known for its fishponds. There are 6,408 bodies of water in the basin area. The largest of them is the largest fishpond in the world, Rožmberk Pond with an area of , which is located directly on the Lužnice. A small water reservoir, Kořensko, is built in the area of the confluence of the Lužnice and Vltava. In the area of the Třeboň Basin, the river meanders significantly and beside the fishponds, the area around the river in this area is rich in small oxbow lakes.

==Nature==
A long section of the river forms the axis of the Třeboňsko Protected Landscape Area. Within this area, the nature reserve of Horní Lužnice is delimited in the immediate vicinity of a 16-km long stretch of the river. It has an area of . The subject of protection is the river and its floodplain with various types of wetland and meadow species. It is one of the last extensive locations in Central Europe of this type. The territory is important mainly for the integrity of the hydrological regime and for many rare, endangered or otherwise important wetland species.

The riverbed in the section between Veselí nad Lužnicí (where Třeboňsko PLA ends) to the mouth of the river is protected as Lužnice Nature Monument with an area of . The reason for protection is the occurrence of rare and endangered species, especially thick shelled river mussel, weatherfish and Eurasian otter.

The most common fish in the river is common chub. Other numerous fish include common roach, common bleak, gudgeon and in fast-flowing sections common barbel. Rare is the occurrence of burbot.

==Bridges==

The Lužnice is spanned by the rare Stádlec Suspension Bridge, which connects Stádlec with the village of Dobřejice (a part of Malšice). The bridge is protected as a national cultural monument.

At Bechyně, the river is spanned by the Bechyně Bridge, a unique reinforced concrete arch bridge. For its value, it is also protected as a national cultural monument.

At the village of Stará Hlína (part of Třeboň), the river is spanned by a stone inundation bridge. It is a valuable twelve-arch bridge from 1799, protected as a cultural monument.

==Tourism==
The Lužnice is among the most popular rivers for river tourism in the country. It it suitable for beginner paddlers. Both the upper course and the lower course are navigable.

<text>The Friendship Bridge (, ) is an arch bridge connecting the Brazilian city of Foz do Iguaçu and the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este.

==History and importance==

The bridge was opened to traffic on 27 March 1965. The space between the main arch is . The bridge itself is long.

The bridge is very important to the economies of both Foz do Iguaçu and Ciudad del Este. 

BR-277 begins immediately after the end of the bridge in the Brazilian side, and National Route N° 7 in the Paraguayan side.

== Smuggling ==
The Friendship Bridge is a major point for smuggling in the region, with Brazilians coming to purchase goods from Paraguay as Paraguay does not impose tariffs on foreign goods. Brazil has been imposing stricter border security to try and crack down on it.

<text>Francesco Berni (1497/98 – 26 May 1535) was an Italian poet. He is credited for beginning what is now known as &quot;Bernesque poetry&quot;, a serio-comedic type of poetry with elements of satire.

==Biography==

===Life===
Berni was born 1497 or 1498 in Lamporecchio (Tuscany).

His father Nicolò was a doctor of a long-established Florentine family, but excessively poor. At an early age he was sent to Florence, where he remained until his nineteenth year and wrote a pastoral play, &quot;Catrina&quot;. In 1517 he set out for Rome, in the service of Bernardo Dovizi, Cardinal Bibbiena. After the cardinal&#x27;s death (1520), he was thrown on his own devices. At the time of the election of Adrian VI he circulated witty lampoons, for which he was obliged for a time to leave Rome. Later he returned to accept a situation as clerk or secretary to Gian Matteo Giberti, datary to Clement VII. The duties of his office, for which Berni was in every way unfit, were exceedingly irksome to the poet, who, however, made himself celebrated at Rome as the most witty and inventive of a certain club of literary men, who devoted themselves to light and sparkling effusions.

So strong was the admiration for Berni&#x27;s verses, that mocking or burlesque poems have since been called &quot;poesie bernesche&quot;. About the year 1530 he was relieved from his servitude by obtaining a canonry in the cathedral of Florence. In that city he died in 1536, according to Romantic tradition poisoned by Duke Alessandro de Medici, for having refused to poison the duke&#x27;s cousin, Ippolito de&#x27; Medici; but considerable obscurity rests over this story.

===Works===
Berni stands at the head of Italian comic or burlesque poets. For lightness, sparkling wit, variety of form and fluent diction, his verses are unsurpassed. Perhaps, however, he owes his greatest fame to the recasting (&quot;Rifacimento&quot;) of Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot;. The enormous success of Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; had directed fresh attention to the older poem, from which it took its characters, and of which it is the continuation. But Boiardo&#x27;s work, though good in plan, could never have achieved wide popularity on account of the extreme ruggedness of its style.

Berni undertook the revision of the whole poem, avowedly altering no sentiment, removing or adding no incident, but simply giving to each line and stanza due gracefulness and polish. His task he completed with marvellous success; scarcely a line remains as it was, and the general opinion has pronounced decisively in favour of the revision over the original. To each &quot;canto&quot; he prefixed a few stanzas of reflective verse in the manner of Ariosto, and in one of these introductions he gives us the only certain information we have concerning his own life. Berni appears to have been favorably disposed towards the Reformation principles at that time introduced into Italy, and this may explain the bitterness of some remarks of his upon the church. The first edition of the &quot;Rifacimento&quot; was printed posthumously in 1541, and it has been supposed that a few passages either did not receive the author&#x27;s final revision, or have been retouched by another hand.

The success of Berni&#x27;s &quot;Rifacimento&quot; was so great that the original text by Boiardo fell into oblivion for three centuries. Only in the nineteenth century did Anthony Panizzi discover in the British Museum Library the authentic &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; and publish it. A partial translation of Berni&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; was published by W.S. Rose in 1823.

==Legacy==
Streets in Florence, Empoli, Pietrasanta, Varese and Verona have been named &quot;via Francesco Berni&quot; after him.

<doc id="1299353" wikidata="Q572648" url="?curid=1299353" title="Pickup (music technology)">
<text>A pickup is an electronic device that converts energy from one form to another that captures or senses mechanical vibrations produced by musical instruments, particularly stringed instruments such as the electric guitar, and converts these to an electrical signal that is amplified using an instrument amplifier to produce musical sounds through a loudspeaker in a speaker enclosure. The signal from a pickup can also be recorded directly.

The first electrical string instrument with pickups, the &quot;Frying Pan&quot; slide guitar, was created by George Beauchamp and Adolph Rickenbacker around 1931.

Most electric guitars and electric basses use magnetic pickups. Acoustic guitars, upright basses and fiddles often use a piezo electric pickup.

==Magnetic pickups==
A typical magnetic pickup is a transducer (specifically a variable reluctance sensor) that consists of one or more permanent magnets (usually alnico or ferrite) wrapped with a coil of several thousand turns of fine enameled copper coil. The magnet creates a magnetic field which is focused by the pickup&#x27;s pole piece or pieces. The permanent magnet in the pickup magnetizes the guitar string above it. This causes the string to generate a magnetic field which is in alignment with that of the permanent magnet. When the string is plucked, the magnetic field around it moves up and down with the string. This moving magnetic field induces a voltage in the coil of the pickup as described by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. Output voltage depends on the instrument and playing style and which string(s) are played and where on the string, but for example, a Samick &quot;TV Twenty&quot; guitar played on the bridge measured 16 mV RMS (200 mV peak) for one string and 128 mV RMS (850 mV peak) for a chord.

The pickup is connected with a 6.35 mm audio jack (instrument cable) to an amplifier, which amplifies the signal to a sufficient magnitude of power to drive a loudspeaker (most amplifiers are above 10 watts). A pickup can also be connected to recording equipment via a patch cable.

A pickup is a part of an electric guitar or bass that &quot;hears&quot; the strings and turns their vibrations into sound. It’s usually attached to the guitar&#x27;s body, but sometimes it’s placed on other parts like the bridge (where the strings rest) or the neck.

Pickups come in different types:

* Single coil pickups: One coil &quot;listens&quot; to all the strings.
* Humbuckers: Two coils work together to reduce noise and give a thicker sound.
* Split coil pickups: Found on certain bass guitars, these have two separate coils, each &quot;listening&quot; to different strings. For example, on a bass with four strings, one coil handles the lower two strings, and the other handles the higher two.

The pickup plays a big role in how the guitar sounds, and different guitars often use unique pickups to create their own signature tone. Guitar companies use this as a key feature to attract buyers.

=== Construction ===
Pickups have magnetic polepieces, typically one or two for each string, with the notable exceptions of rail and lipstick tube pickups. Single polepieces are approximately centered on each string whereas dual polepieces such as the standard pickups on the Fender Jazz Bass and Precision Bass sit either side of each string.

On most guitars, the strings are not fully parallel: they converge at the nut and diverge at the bridge. Thus, bridge, neck and middle pickups usually have different polepiece spacings on the same guitar.

There are several standards on pickup sizes and string spacing between the poles. Spacing is measured either as a distance between 1st to 6th polepieces&#x27; centers (this is also called &quot;E-to-E&quot; spacing), or as a distance between adjacent polepieces&#x27; centers.

=== Output ===
Some high-output pickups employ very strong magnets, thus creating more flux and thereby more output. This can be detrimental to the final sound because the magnet&#x27;s pull on the strings (called string capture) can cause problems with intonation as well as damp the strings and reduce sustain.

Other high-output pickups have more turns of wire to increase the voltage generated by the string&#x27;s movement. However, this also increases the pickup&#x27;s output resistance and impedance, which can affect high frequencies if the pickup is not isolated by a buffer amplifier or a DI unit.

===Pickup sound===
The turns of wire in proximity to each other have an equivalent self-capacitance that, when added to any cable capacitance present, resonates with the inductance of the winding. This resonance can accentuate certain frequencies, giving the pickup a characteristic tonal quality. The more turns of wire in the winding, the higher the output voltage but the lower this resonance frequency.

The arrangement of parasitic resistances and capacitances in the guitar, cable, and amplifier input, combined with the inductive source impedance inherent in this type of transducer forms a resistively-damped second-order low-pass filter, producing a non-linearity effect not found in piezoelectric or optical transducers. Pickups are usually designed to feed a high input impedance, typically a megohm or more, and a low-impedance load increases attenuation of higher frequencies. Typical maximum frequency of a single-coil pickup is around 5 kHz, with the highest note on a typical guitar fretboard having a fundamental frequency of 1.17 kHz.

=== Humbuckers ===
Single-coil pickups act like a directional antenna and are prone to pick up mains hum—nuisance alternating current electromagnetic interference from electrical power cables, power transformers, fluorescent light ballasts, video monitors or televisions—along with the musical signal. Mains hum consists of a fundamental signal at a nominal 50 or 60 Hz, depending on local current frequency, and usually some harmonic content.

To overcome this, the humbucking pickup was invented by Joseph Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Butts (for Gretsch), while Seth Lover also worked on one for Gibson. Who developed it first is a matter of some debate, but Butts was awarded the first patent () and Lover came next ().

A humbucking pickup is composed of two coils, with each coil wound reverse to the other. Each set of six magnetic poles is also opposite in polarity. Since ambient hum from electrical devices reaches the coils as common-mode noise, it induces an equal voltage in each coil, but 180 degrees out of phase between the two voltages. These effectively cancel each other, while the signal from the guitar string is doubled.

When wired in series, as is most common, the overall inductance of the pickup is increased, which lowers its resonance frequency and attenuates the higher frequencies, giving a less trebly tone (i.e., &quot;fatter&quot;) than either of the two component single-coil pickups would give alone.

An alternative wiring places the coils in &quot;buck&quot; parallel, which has a more neutral effect on resonant frequency. This pickup wiring is rare, as guitarists have come to expect that humbucking pickups &#x27;have a sound&#x27;, and are not so neutral. On fine jazz guitars, the parallel wiring produces significantly cleaner sound, as the lowered source impedance drives capacitive cable with lower high frequency attenuation.

A &quot;side-by-side&quot; humbucking pickup senses a wider section of each string than a single-coil pickup. By picking up a larger portion of the vibrating string, more lower harmonics are present in the signal produced by the pickup in relation to high harmonics, resulting in a &quot;fatter&quot; tone. Humbucking pickups in the narrow form factor of a single coil, designed to replace single-coil pickups, have the narrower aperture resembling that of a single coil pickup. Some models of these single-coil-replacement humbuckers produce more authentic resemblances to classic single-coil tones than full-size humbucking pickups of a similar inductance.

=== Notation ===

Most electric guitars have two or three magnetic pickups. A combination of pickups is called a &quot;pickup configuration&quot;, usually notated by writing out the pickup types in order from bridge pickup through mid to neck pickup, using &quot;S&quot; for single-coil and &quot;H&quot; for humbucker. Typically the bridge pickup is known as the lead pickup, and the neck pickup is known as the rhythm pickup.

Common pickup configurations include:

*H-H (Gibson Les Paul, many others including superstrats)
Less frequently found configurations are:
* S (Fender Esquire, early Gibson Les Paul Juniors, Gibson Melody Maker, Danelectro U1, some Telecasters)
* H (Gibson ES-165 Herb Ellis, Kramer Baretta, later Les Paul Juniors)
* H-S (Hamer Californian Deluxe, Les Paul BFG, Squier &#x27;51)
* H-H-H (some Gibson Les Paul Goldtop and Custom models, Gibson SG-3, Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster (after 1957), Kramer Jersey Star, Ibanez Destroyer, Ibanez PGM200)

Examples of rare configurations that only a few particular models use include:

* H-S, but with single coil in the middle (one model of Fender Jazzmaster, Ibanez RG2011SC, Fender Player Jaguar)
* H-S-S, but with no space between the middle single coil and the bridge humbucker (Hamer Phantom with angled neck pickup)
* H-H-S (Mayones Legend “22” Anders Nyström signature, some ESP Stephen Carpenter Models, and Alembic Jerry Garcia Models)
* H-S-S-H (Music Man Steve Morse Signature)
* S-H (some Telecasters, Music Man “Valentine” James Valentine signature)
* S-H-H (some early seven-string ESP Horizons)
* S-H-S (Fender Wayne Kramer Signature)

== Piezoelectric pickups ==

=== Sensors ===
The piezoelectric pickup contains a piezo crystal, which converts the vibrations directly to a changing voltage.

Many semi-acoustic and acoustic guitars, and some electric guitars and basses, have been fitted with piezoelectric pickups instead of, or in addition to, magnetic pickups. These have a very different sound, and also have the advantage of not picking up any other magnetic fields, such as mains hum and feedback from monitoring loops. In hybrid guitars, this system allows switching between magnetic pickup and piezo sounds, or simultaneously blending the output. Solid bodied guitars with only a piezo pickup are known as silent guitars, which are usually used for practicing by acoustic guitarists. Piezo pickups can also be built into electric guitar bridges for conversion of existing instruments.

Most pickups for bowed string instruments, such as cello, violin, and double bass, are piezoelectric. These may be inlaid into the bridge, laid between the bridge feet and the top of the instrument, or, less frequently, wedged under a wing of the bridge. Some pickups are fastened to the top of the instrument with removable putty.

=== Preamps ===
Piezoelectric pickups have a very high output impedance and appear as a capacitance in series with a voltage source. They therefore often have an instrument-mounted buffer amplifier fitted to maximize frequency response.

The piezo pickup gives a very wide frequency range output compared to the magnetic types and can give large amplitude signals from the strings. For this reason, the buffer amplifier is often powered from relatively high voltage rails (about ±9 V) to avoid distortion due to clipping. A less linear preamp (like a single-FET amplifier) might be preferable due to softer clipping characteristics. Such an amplifier starts to distort sooner, which makes the distortion less &quot;buzzy&quot; and less audible than a more linear, but less forgiving op-amp. However, at least one study indicates that most people cannot tell the difference between FET and op-amp circuits in blind listening comparisons of electric instrument preamps, which correlates with results of formal studies of other types of audio devices. Sometimes, piezoelectric pickups are used in conjunction with magnetic types to give a wider range of available sounds.

For early pickup devices using the piezoelectric effect, see phonograph.

== Other transducers ==
Some pickup products are installed and used similarly to piezoelectric pickups, but use different underlying technology, for instance electret or condenser microphone technology.

== Double systems pickups ==

There are basically four principles used to convert sound into an alternating current, each with their pros and cons:
# A microphone registers the vibrations of the air caused by the instrument. In general this technique guarantees a good sound quality, but with two limitations: feedback and crosstalk.
# Contact pickups register the vibrations of the instrument itself. They have the advantage of producing little feedback and no crosstalk at all. In spite of their lesser sound quality and thanks to their low price, contact pickups (and especially the piezoelectric pickup) have become the most popular transducer.
# Magnetic pickups. Magnetic pickups, as applied in electric guitars, register the vibrations of nickel or steel strings in a magnetic field. They have the advantage that they can be connected directly to an (electric guitar) amplifier, but in combination with a steel-string acoustic guitar the sound tends to be electric. This is why acoustic guitarists typically choose a piezoelectric pickup, built in microphone, or both.
# Electrostatic pickups. Another way is to use the changing capacitance between the string and a pickup plate. These electronic pickups produce much higher dynamics than conventional pickups, so the difference between a soft and a loud pick strike is more pronounced than with other types of pickups.

An amplification system with two transducers combines the qualities of both. A combination of a microphone and a piezoelectric pickup typically produces better sound quality and less sensitivity to feedback, as compared to single transducers. However, this is not always the case. A less frequently used combination is a piezoelectric and a magnetic pickup. This combination can work well for a solid sound with dynamics and expression. Examples of a double system amplifier are the Highlander iP-2, the Verweij VAMP or the LR Baggs dual source and the D-TAR Multisource.

== Multi-transducer pickups ==
Hexaphonic pickups (also called &quot;divided pickups&quot; and &quot;polyphonic pickups&quot;) have a separate output for each string (&quot;Hexaphonic&quot; assumes six strings, as on a guitar). This allows for separate processing and amplification for each string. It also allows a converter to sense the pitch coming from individual string signals for producing note commands, typically according to the MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) protocol. A hexaphonic pickup and a converter are usually components of a guitar/synthesizer.

Such pickups are uncommon (compared to normal ones), and only a few notable models exist, like the piezoelectric pickups on the Moog Guitar. Hexaphonic pickups can be either magnetic or piezoelectric or based on the condensor principle like electronicpickups

== Optical ==
Optical pickups are a fairly recent development that work by sensing the interruption of a light beam by a vibrating string. The light source is usually an LED, and the detector is a photodiode or phototransistor. These pickups are completely resistant to magnetic or electric interference and also have a very broad and flat frequency response, unlike magnetic pickups.

Optical pickup guitars were first shown at the 1969 NAMM Convention in Chicago, by Ron Hoag.
In 2000, Christopher Willcox, founder of LightWave Systems, unveiled a new beta technology for an optical pickup system using infrared light. In May 2001, LightWave Systems released their second generation pickup, dubbed the &quot;S2.&quot;

== Active and passive pickups ==

Pickups can be either active or passive. Pickups, apart from optical types, are inherently passive transducers. &quot;Passive&quot; pickups are usually wire-wound around a magnet, and are the most common type used. They can generate electric potential without need for external power, though their output is relatively low, and the harmonic content of output depends greatly on the winding.
&quot;Active&quot; pickups incorporate electronic circuitry to modify the signal. Active circuits are able to filter, attenuate or boost the signal from the pickup. The main disadvantage of an active system is requirement of a battery power source to operate the preamp circuitry. Batteries limit circuit design and functionality, in addition to being inconvenient to the musician. The circuitry may be as simple as a single transistor, or up to several operational amplifiers configured as active filters, active EQ and other sound-shaping features. The op amps used must be of a low-power design to optimize battery life, a design restriction that limits the dynamic range of the circuit. The active circuitry may contain audio filters, which reduce the dynamic range and mildly distort certain ranges. High-output active pickup systems also have an effect on an amplifier&#x27;s input circuit.

==Stereo and multiple pickups with individual outputs==

Rickenbacker was the first manufacturer to market stereo instruments (guitars and basses). Their proprietary &quot;Ric-O-Sound&quot; circuitry has two separate output jacks, allowing the musician to send each pickup to its own audio chain (effects device, amplifier, mix console input).

Teisco produced a guitar with a stereo option. Teisco divided the two sections in the upper three strings and the lower three strings for each individual output.

The Gittler guitar was a limited production guitar with six pickups, one for each string.

Gibson created the HD.6X Pro guitar that captures a separate signal for each individual string and sends them to an onboard analog/digital converter, then out of the guitar via Ethernet cable.

<text>Charles Allan Grafly, Jr. (December 3, 1862 – May 5, 1929) was an American sculptor, and teacher. Instructor of Sculpture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for 37 years, his students included Paul Manship, Albin Polasek, and Walker Hancock.

He created heroic sculpture for international expositions and war memorials, but also was noted for his small bronzes and portrait busts. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Academy of Design, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, and other museums.

==Education==
Grafly was born in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the youngest of the 8 children of Charles and Elizabeth (Simmons) Grafly. His family were Quaker farmers, and of German and Dutch heritage. He attended Philadelphia public schools, and developed an interest in art at an early age. At 17 he apprenticed himself to John Struthers &amp; Sons Marble Works, at that time one of the largest stone carving ventures in the country. He spent four years carving ornament and figures for Philadelphia City Hall, under the direction of sculptor Alexander Milne Calder.

To improve his understanding of anatomy and his skill at carving figures, he began attending night classes at the Spring Garden Institute. He studied under Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts beginning in 1884, and followed Eakins to the Art Students&#x27; League of Philadelphia in 1886. He returned to PAFA the following year, and studied under Thomas Anshutz.

Grafly moved to Paris in 1888, where he studied for a year at the Académie Julian—drawing under Tony Robert-Fleury, painting under William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and sculpture under Henri Chapu. He shared a flat with fellow American art students Robert Henri, Harry Finney, William Hoefeker, and James Randolph Fisher. In 1889 he gained admittance to the École des Beaux Arts, but only stayed one year. He exhibited two ideal busts, &quot;Saint John&quot; and &quot;Daedalus&quot; at the Paris Salon of 1890. He exhibited his first major work, a life-size female nude, &quot;Mauvais Presage&quot;, at the Salon of 1891, which received an Honorable Mention. It is now at the Detroit Institute of Arts.

==Career==

The death of his father brought Grafly back to Philadelphia in early 1892, and he began teaching at the Drexel Institute and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. PAFA created the position of &quot;Instructor of Sculpture&quot; for Grafly, and under him the sculpture department was put &quot;on an equal footing with painting for the first time&quot;. He took a one-year sabbatical in 1895, to get married and create what he hoped would be his masterpiece.

In Paris, he began work on &quot;The Vulture of War&quot;, a nightmarish sculpture group depicting carnage and death. It quickly evolved from a two-figure work to a three-figure work, and ultimately a four-figure work. These consisted of the colossal figure of &quot;War&quot;; who wields the uncomprehending &quot;Man&quot; as a weapon (swings him like a scythe); a lifeless woman (&quot;Death and Destruction&quot;); and the sinister figure of &quot;Plunder&quot;, who holds the globe under his foot. Sculptor Jean Dampt provided Grafly with weekly critiques as the work progressed. Of the four figures, only the plunderer was completed by the end of his sabbatical. Grafly returned to teaching at PAFA in Fall 1896, but continued to work on the sculpture group. A heroic-sized plaster of the plunderer was exhibited at PAFA&#x27;s 1898 annual exhibition, and was part of Grafly&#x27;s gold medal-winning exhibit at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. The plaster was also part of Grafly&#x27;s exhibit at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, but he abandoned it there rather than paying the freight fees to ship it back to Philadelphia.

Grafly was commissioned in 1898 to create two colossal busts for the Smith Memorial Arch, a Civil War monument in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. Following sculptor William Ordway Partridge&#x27;s withdrawal, Grafly also created the memorial&#x27;s 15-foot (4.6 m) statue of General John F. Reynolds.

===Expositions===
====&quot;Fountain of Man&quot;====
Grafly and architect Charles Dudley Arnold were commissioned to create a fountain for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, in Buffalo, New York. &quot;The Fountain of Man&quot; was crowned by an eerie half-hooded central figure, &quot;Man, the Mysterious&quot;, with faces on the front and back of his head representing the two natures of Man. Supporting the fountain&#x27;s upper basin were nude figures representing the 5 senses, and supporting the lower basin were four pairs of crouching male and female atlantes, each couple representing contrasting emotions— love and hate, ambition and despair, etc. Sculptor Lorado Taft wrote: When opportunity comes, and with it demand for a man&#x27;s highest abilities, he who has always done his best has himself well in hand. Such an opportunity came to Mr. Grafly at the Pan-American Exposition. While the sculptural decorations of that most charming of fairs were as a rule well suited to their purpose, and contributed much to its beauty, there were few features of striking originality. The one which stands out in memory as of permanent value, as a lasting contribution to the art of this country, is Mr. Grafly&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Man&quot;.

====Louisiana Purchase Exposition====

Grafly served as a member of the Art Jury for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, and designed the medal that was awarded to winning artists. Following sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward&#x27;s withdrawal, Grafly created a heroic-size seated figure of &quot;Thomas Jefferson&quot; for the Cascade Garden. His &quot;Vérité&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;) was carved in marble, and installed in a niche flanking the main entrance to the Palace of Fine Arts (now the Saint Louis Art Museum). His sculpture group, &quot;Electricity&quot;, was installed over an entrance to the Palace of Electricity.

====&quot;Pioneer Mother Monument&quot;====

Grafly&#x27;s best known sculpture is probably the &quot;Pioneer Mother Monument&quot; (1913–15), in San Francisco, California. John E. D. Trask, a museum administrator and former managing director of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, headed the Fine Arts Department for the planned 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition. The Pioneer Mother Monument Association raised $22,500 for the project, and Trask commissioned Grafly to create the sculpture in 1913. Grafly&#x27;s plaster sketches are preserved at Wichita State University&#x27;s Ulrich Museum of Art, and an early iteration of the work bordered on comical—a stalwart mother balancing screaming twin infants, one on each arm. Grafly&#x27;s final model went in another direction, granting the woman and her two naked toddlers a simple dignity. The casting took longer than expected, and the sculpture was not in place for the exhibition&#x27;s March 2, 1915 opening. Set atop a 26-foot (7.9 m) stepped concrete base, the monument was dedicated on June 30, 1915.
The &quot;Pioneer Mother&quot; monument, by Charles Grafly, is a permanent bronze, a tribute by the people of the West to the women who laid the foundation of their welfare. It is to stand in the San Francisco Civic Center, where its masterful simplicity will be more impressive than in this colorful colonnade. It is a true addition to noteworthy American works of art and fully expresses the spirit of this courageous motherhood, tender but strong, adventurous but womanly, enduring but not humble. It has escaped every pitfall of mawkishness, stubbornly refused to descend to mere prettiness, and lived up to the noblest possibilities of its theme. The strong hands, the firmly set feet, the clear, broad brow of the Mother and the uncompromisingly simple, sculpturally pure lines of figure and garments are honest and commanding in beauty. The children, too, are modeled with affectionate sincerity and are a realistic interpretation of childish charm. Oxen skulls, pine cones, leaves and cacti decorate the base; the panels show the old sailing vessel, the Golden Gate, and the transcontinental trails.
Relocation of the monument to San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center never happened, and the sculpture was rediscovered during the Great Depression, weather-beaten and vandalized, amidst the ruins of the 1915 world&#x27;s fair. Civic and historical groups, notably the Native Daughters of the Golden West, raised money to restore the sculpture for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. After the exposition, it was installed in Golden Gate Park and rededicated on December 8, 1940.

===Other works===
====Portrait busts====

Grafly modeled dozens of portrait heads and busts; many as commissions, but also of friends and family members. In 1898, he modeled a bust of Hugh H. Breckenridge, the first in what became a three-decade series of busts of fellow artists. The sitter sometimes painted a portrait of Grafly in exchange. Lorado Taft claimed &quot;there is no sculptor in this country who can make a finer bust&quot;. Critic Helen W. Henderson wrote:
The bust of Henry Lorenz Viereck, entomologist, is the unique work of Charles Grafly in Washington. [D.C.] It is owned by the sitter. This bust, made about 1908, is one of the most successful of that series of portrait busts commenced by the sculptor a few years ago, and including at the present time, many distinguished artists, doctors, and specialists in other fields. In the department of portrait busts Grafly stands unrivalled in his generation. The head of Viereck is extremely typical of the quality and character of the sculptor&#x27;s achievement.
In the 1920s, Grafly created four busts of historical figures for the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, in Bronx, New York City.

====New York Custom House====
Grafly modeled two of the colossal figures for the façade of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Manhattan, New York City. His allegorical figure of &quot;England&quot; (1903–07) depicts a young Queen Victoria dressed in armor, holding the wand of Hermes and accompanied by the shield of St. George and a ship&#x27;s wheel. His allegorical figure of &quot;France&quot; (1904–07) depicts a goddess crowned with a laurel wreath, holding a sceptre, a sheaf of wheat and a bronze statuette representing the Fine Arts, and accompanied by a Gallic rooster and a herm of the ancient god Dusios. Both figures were carved in limestone by the Piccirilli Brothers.

====Meade Memorial====

The most prestigious commission of Grafly&#x27;s career was the &quot;Major General George Gordon Meade Memorial&quot; (1915–27), a monument for the National Mall in Washington, D.C. General Meade (1815–1872) had been commander of the decisive Union victory at Gettysburg, and the memorial was the gift of Pennsylvania to the nation. It was originally installed south of Pennsylvania Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd Streets NW—a site now mostly covered by the Capitol Reflecting Pool. This was opposite and slightly north of the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial.

On January 21, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed a joint resolution of Congress creating the federal commission for the Meade Memorial. On November 23, 1915, the commission chose Grafly as sculptor and Simon &amp; Bassett (later Simon &amp; Simon) as architects for the project. Grafly&#x27;s sculpture program went through several iterations before it was granted preliminary approval by the D.C. Commission of Fine Arts, three years later. His design mixed the literal, the allegorical and the fantastical, and was granted final approval in January 1922. 

The memorial features eight figures grouped in a circle. The primary figure of General Meade, dressed in his Civil War uniform, faces south. He is flanked by six nude allegorical figures – &quot;Loyalty&quot;, &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Energy&quot; on the west side; &quot;Chivalry&quot;, &quot;Progress&quot; and &quot;Military Courage&quot; on the east side – representing qualities that Grafly &quot;believed were necessary for the character of a great general&quot;. Facing north is the dark angel of &quot;War&quot;, &quot;unchanged since war first ravaged the world&quot;, who wears a helmet, breastplate and cape, and before whom stands a knightly sword, ready to be taken up when necessary. &quot;&quot;War&quot;... holds in his grim clutch two memorial tablets [on which are listed Meade&#x27;s military battles]. His wings, in long sweeping curves, stretch toward the standard held by &quot;Loyalty&quot;... The side groups are thus outlined against the ominous shadow of the wings of &quot;War&quot;.&quot; &quot;Loyalty&quot; and &quot;Chivalry&quot; remove General Meade&#x27;s &quot;cloak of battle&quot;. &quot;&quot;Loyalty&quot; also raises aloft over Meade&#x27;s head a standard [ Legion eagle ] of wreaths and garlands, in commemoration of great achievement.&quot;

The Piccirilli Brothers carved the figures from white Tennessee marble. The cylindrical base is gray granite, and its stepped circular platform is Milford pink granite. The memorial was dedicated on October 19, 1927.

The Meade Memorial was dismantled in 1969, to make way for excavation of the 3rd Street Tunnel under the National Mall and construction of the Capitol Reflecting Pool. Following fourteen years in storage, the memorial underwent restoration, and was installed on the entrance plaza of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in 1983, one block northwest of its original site.

====Pennypacker Memorial====
Grafly was commissioned to create a memorial to Major General Galusha Pennypacker for Logan Square, Philadelphia. A valorous Civil War officer, Pennypacker had been promoted to general at age 22. Grafly&#x27;s concept was to depict him in the prime of his manhood—as a burly, bare-chested Roman general, flanked by tigers and straddling a chariot-like cannon. Grafly invited his former student Albert Laessle to model the tigers, and worked on the project, 1921–26, before setting it aside to complete the Meade Memorial. In 1934, five years after Grafly&#x27;s death, Laessle completed the Pennypacker Memorial based on his teacher&#x27;s designs.

===Other honors===
The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts awarded Grafly its 1899 Converse Gold Medal of Honor &quot;for distinguished services to art and to the Academy&quot;. The National Sculpture Society awarded him its 1905 J. Q. A. Ward Prize. At its 1913 annual exhibition, PAFA awarded him the first Widener Gold Medal for Sculpture for his portrait bust of &quot;Thomas Anshutz&quot;. The Philadelphia Water Color Club awarded him its 1916 Lea First Prize (for drawing). The National Academy of Design awarded him its 1919 Watrous Gold Medal, for his portrait bust of &quot;Childe Hassam&quot;. The Chicago Art Institute awarded him its 1921 Potter Palmer Gold Medal for his portrait bust of &quot;Frank Duveneck&quot;, and the Concord Art Association awarded him its 1922 Medal of Honor for the same work.

Grafly was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society (1893), served on its council, and was later elected a Fellow. He was elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design in 1902, and an Academician in 1905. (Robert Henri painted Grafly&#x27;s NAD diploma portrait.) He was a member of the Philadelphia Art Club, the Architectural League of New York, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and other arts organizations.

==Personal==
Grafly married Frances Sekeles of Corinth, Mississippi, on June 7, 1895. They had one daughter, Dorothy (1896–1980), born in Paris during his sabbatical from PAFA. The Graflys lived at 2140 N. 12th Street, Philadelphia, and he had a studio at 2200 Arch Street.

In 1905, Grafly bought property in Lanesville, Gloucester, Massachusetts, and built a house and studio that he named &quot;Fool&#x27;s Paradise&quot;. Favored PAFA students were invited to visit and use his studio. Following the 1917 death of sculptor Bela Pratt, Grafly taught (additionally) at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He made &quot;Fool&#x27;s Paradise&quot; his residence year-round, and commuted to Philadelphia or Boston by train.

Grafly&#x27;s protégé, Walker Hancock, considered him &quot;the pre-eminent instructor of sculpture in this country&quot;, and came to PAFA in 1920 specifically to study under him. Hancock won awards for his work as a student, two traveling scholarships and, after graduation, the 1925 Prix de Rome in sculpture. In April 1929, on the day Hancock returned to Philadelphia from the American Academy in Rome, he heard the news—Grafly had been struck by a hit-and-run driver the night before.
During the ensuing days, even though he was gradually failing, we had the opportunity to talk about things that concerned him. Two things were very much on his mind. He asked me to make sure that the wreath behind the head of General Meade in the &quot;Meade Memorial&quot; in Washington would be freshly gilded. His other worry was that the landscaping around his statue of James Buchanan in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, had not been carried out. He wanted me to see that this was done.&lt;br&gt;
In the period of his hospitalization and suffering, Grafly told Mr. [John Andrew] Myers [Director of PAFA] that he wanted me to take his place as instructor of sculpture at the Pennsylvania Academy. He lived only two weeks after the accident.

Hancock was among those who eulogized Grafly at his memorial service. The pall bearers at his funeral included former students Albert Laessle and Albin Polasek; and artists Hugh Breckenridge, Edward Redfield, Robert Henri and Albert Rosenthal.

===Legacy===
Except for his sabbatical in 1895–96, Grafly taught at PAFA from 1892 to his death in 1929. Among his students were sculptors Eugene Castello, Nancy Coonsman, George Demetrios, Hazel Brill Jackson, Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, Walker Hancock, Charles Harley, Albert Laessle, Paul Manship, Eleanor Mary Mellon, Louis Milione, Albin Polasek, Dudley Pratt, Lawrence Tenney Stevens, and Katherine Lane Weems.

The collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts includes about twenty Grafly bronzes. The Ulrich Museum of Art at Wichita State University possesses more than two hundred of his works, mostly plaster casts, a bequest of Dorothy Grafly Drummond (the artist&#x27;s daughter).

Dorothy Grafly became an art critic and author. Her 1929 biography of her father, &quot;The Sculptor&#x27;s Clay: Charles Grafly (1862–1929)&quot;, was reissued by Wichita State University in 1996.

<text>Ermengarde (or Irmingard) of Hesbaye ( 778 – 3 October 818), probably a member of the Robertian dynasty, was Carolingian empress from 813 and Queen of the Franks from 814 until her death as the wife of the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious.

==Life==
Ermengarde was the daughter of Count Ingerman of Hesbaye and Rotrude.

About 794 Ermengarde married Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, who since 781 ruled as a King of Aquitaine. He had already fathered two children, and Ermengarde may have been his concubine. Ermengarde gave birth to six children: 
* Lothair I (795–855), born in Altdorf, Bavaria
* Pepin I of Aquitaine (797–838) 
* Berta, born c. 799
* Rotrude, born about 800
* Hildegard, born c. 802, abbess of Notre-Dame in Laon
* Louis the German (c. 805 – 876), King of East Francia

Charlemagne initially intended to divide his Carolingian Empire between Louis and his brothers Pepin and Charles, who nevertheless died in quick succession in 810/11. On 10 September 813, Charlemagne designated Louis his successor and had him proclaimed co-emperor. Ermengarde&#x27;s husband became sole emperor and king of the Franks upon his father&#x27;s death on 28 January 814. The couple was anointed and crowned emperor and empress by Pope Stephen IV on 5 October 816 in Reims Cathedral.

She died at Angers, Neustria (in present-day France) on 3 October 818. A few years after her death, her husband remarried to Judith of Bavaria, who bore him Charles the Bald.

<text>Ingerman (Ingram, Enguerrand) (c. 750-818), was a Frankish noble and Count of Hesbaye, son of a brother of Saint Chrodegang, the Bishop of Metz and therefore grandson of Sigramnus of Hesbaye.

==Life==
Ingram came from a high noble family from Haspengouw near Liège. He was a nephew of Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz.
Ingerman married Rotrude, of unknown parentage. Ingerman and Rotrude had one daughter:
* Ermengarde. She married into the Frankish royal family, the Carolingians and was the first wife of King Louis the Pious, Son of Charlemagne.

==Primary sources mentioning Ingoram==

There seems to be only one primary source directly mentioning Ingoram.

In a medieval life story of Emperor Louis the Pious, by Thegan of Trier, Louis&#x27;s wife Ermengarde is said to be a daughter of the noble duke Ingorammus, who was son of a brother of Hruotgangi &quot;sancti pontificis&quot;, or in other words Saint Chrodegang.

Chrodegang in turn was named in one medieval record as having parents who were nobles from Hasbania (Hesbaye). Paul the Deacon identified the parents of Chrodegang as Sigram and Landrada.

<doc id="1299398" wikidata="Q7882855" url="?curid=1299398" title="Clean hands">
<text>Clean hands, sometimes called the clean hands doctrine, unclean hands doctrine, or dirty hands doctrine, is an equitable defense in which the defendant argues that the plaintiff is not entitled to obtain an equitable remedy because the plaintiff is acting unethically or has acted in bad faith with respect to the subject of the complaint—that is, with &quot;unclean hands&quot;. The defendant has the burden of proof to show the plaintiff is not acting in good faith. The doctrine is often stated as &quot;those seeking equity must do equity&quot; or &quot;equity must come with clean hands&quot;. This is a matter of protocol, characterised by A. P. Herbert in &quot;Uncommon Law&quot; by his fictional Judge Mildew saying (as Herbert says, &quot;less elegantly&quot;), &quot;A dirty dog will not have justice by the court&quot;.

A defendant&#x27;s unclean hands can also be claimed and proven by the plaintiff to claim other equitable remedies and to prevent that defendant from asserting equitable affirmative defenses. In other words, &#x27;unclean hands&#x27; can be used offensively by the plaintiff as well as defensively by the defendant. Historically, the doctrine of unclean hands can be traced as far back as the Fourth Lateran Council.

&quot;He who comes into equity must come with clean hands&quot; is an equitable maxim in English law.

== Maxim ==
The maxim prevents those who have acted improperly in some way relating to the matter at hand from seeking a remedy or relief. Essentially, anyone with &#x27;unclean hands&#x27;, someone who has in some way contributed to their own injury or loss, or has in some other way acted dishonourably relating to the matter will be prevented by a court from remedy or relief regardless of how the adversary has treated them. The maxim protects the integrity of a court.

== Applications ==

===US patent law===
The clean hands doctrine is used in US patent law to deny equitable or legal relief to a patentee that has engaged in improper conduct, such as using the patent to extend monopoly power beyond the claims of the patent.

<doc id="1299402" wikidata="Q1359400" url="?curid=1299402" title="Meyers Manx">
<text>The Meyers Manx dune buggy is a small, two-passenger, recreational kit car designed and marketed by California engineer, artist, boat builder and surfer Bruce F. Meyers and manufactured by his Fountain Valley, California company, B. F. Meyers &amp; Co. from 1964 to 1971.

The roofless, windowless, fenderless, high-hipped and high-tailed fiberglass body was designed to work with the mechanicals and chassis of a Volkswagen Beetle, exposing the engine and taking advantage of the Beetle&#x27;s light weight, rear-engine traction, removable bodywork and suitability to off- and on-road driving. 

Drawing on his art background, Meyers would later say he combined the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen’s high fenders and short wheelbase, the Volkswagen Kubelwagen&#x27;s stand-up headlamps and the chic, open simplicity of European beach cars — e.g., the Fiat 500 Jolly, Citroën Méhari, Renault Rodeo and BMC Mini Moke.

The Manx immediately began dominating dune racing and breaking records and was eventually also released in on-road models. The original company would succumb to tax problems after Meyers&#x27;s departure, and was re-founded in 2000 as Meyers Manx, Inc., marketing new kits inspired by the original Manx. 

In 2024, Meyer&#x27;s original Manx prototype was inducted into the National Historic Vehicle Register, for its association with American historic events and figures, and its design and construction importance. Meyers himself died on February 19, 2021 at 94.

The &quot;Manx&quot; nameplate and logo derived from the cat, sharing the cat&#x27;s high-tailed, stubby profile.

==Home-made prototype==
Drawing on his experience in sailboat construction, Meyers modeled and built his first dune buggy, &quot;Old Red&quot;, a shortened VW Beetle with a monocoque fiberglass shell and Chevrolet pickup truck (trailing arm style) suspension, in late 1963 to May 1964 in his garage in Newport Beach, California. The first known street-legal fiberglass dune buggy, it featured a unibody shell that fused body, fenders and frame, retaining just the engine, transmission and other mechanicals of the VW, and with no top and no hood. The use of compound curves throughout provided great rigidity. The fenders were arched high, to make room for large, knobby dirt-racing wheels.

The &quot;Manx&quot; name for the shortened, taller-wheeled, more maneuverable VW Beetle mods refers to and derives from the comparably stubby Manx cat The tailless cat in the logo, as featured on the hood ornament, is stylized after a passant heraldic lion, its right forepaw brandishing a sword. The name also suggests racing fitness, as the already globally-renowned British-manufactured Norton Manx motorcycle dominated the Isle of Man TT, Manx Grand Prix and other Isle of Man-based (i.e. Manx) international races from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The Meyers Manx has no direct connection to the Isle of Man.

Meyers produced kits later in 1964 and into 1965, marketed under the name Meyers Manx. Although this early design was critically acclaimed, even featured on the April 1967 cover of &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine, and drew much attention, it proved too expensive to be profitable; ultimately only 12 kits of the monocoque Manx were produced. 

Amateur racers Meyers and a friend broke the Ensenada – La Paz record of 39 hours by four hours, until then held by a professional racer. According to James Hale, compiler of the &quot;Dune Buggy Handbook&quot;, the win ushered in an era of Meyers Manx &quot;domination in off-road events ... and the formation of NORRA (National Off-Road Racing Association)&quot;.

==B. F. Meyers &amp; Co.==
The commercially manufactured Meyers Manx Mk I featured an open-wheeled fiberglass bodyshell, to be coupled by its purchaser with the Volkswagen Type 1 flat-four engine (1.2 L, 1.3 L, 1.5 L and 1.6 L, in different models) and a modified RR-layout Beetle pan. It is a small car, with a wheelbase shorter than a Beetle automobile for lightness and better maneuverability. For this reason, the car is capable of very quick acceleration and good off-road performance, despite not being four-wheel drive. The usually street-legal car redefined and filled a recreational and competitive niche that had been essentially invented by the first civilian Jeep in 1945, and which was later to be overtaken by straddle-ridden, motorcycle-based all-terrain vehicles (introduced in 1970) and newer, small and sporty (but usually four-wheel-drive), off-road automobiles.

The commercial Meyers Manx received widespread recognition when it defeated motorcycles, trucks and other cars to win the inaugural 1967 Mexican 1000 race (the predecessor of the Baja 1000). It crossed automotive press genre and was selected as the cover story for the August 1966 issue of &quot;Hot Rod&quot; Magazine.

Approximately 6,000 original Manxe kits were manufactured, but when the design became popular, many copies (estimated at a quarter of a million worldwide) were made by other companies. Although already patented, Meyers &amp; Co. lost in court to the copiers, the judge rescinding his patent as unpatentable, opening the floodgates to the industry Meyers started. Since then, numerous vehicles of the general &quot;dune buggy&quot; or &quot;beach buggy&quot; body type, some VW-based, have been produced. An early example was the Imp by EMPI (1968–1970), which borrowed styling elements from the Chevrolet Corvette but was otherwise Manx-like. A later 1970s Manx clone was the Dune Runner from Dune Buggy Enterprises in Westminster, California. The Meyers company attempted to stay ahead of this seemingly unfair competition with the release of the distinctive, and harder-to-copy, Meyers Manx Mk II design.

B. F. Meyers &amp; Co. also produced other Beetle-based vehicles, including the May 1970 Car &amp; Driver magazine cover sporty Manx SR variant (&quot;s&quot;treet &quot;r&quot;oadsters, borrowing some design ideas from the Porsche 914), the Meyers Tow&#x27;d (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Manx Tow&#x27;d&quot;, a non-street-legal racing vehicle designed to be towed to the desert or beach), the Meyers Tow&#x27;dster (a street-legal hybrid of the two), and Meyers Resorter a.k.a. Meyers Turista (a small recreational or &quot;resort&quot; vehicle inspired by touring motorcycles). The Manx SR2 was a modified SR that was only produced by later manufacturers including Karma Coachworks, Heartland Motors and Manx Motors of MD. While the Tow&#x27;d was a minimal off-road racer and the SR/SR2 was a showy roadster, the Tow&#x27;dster was a compromise between a dune-capable vehicle and a more utilitarian street rod, and &quot;paved the way for the rail-type buggy that was to dominate the buggy scene following the demise of the traditional Manx-type buggy.&quot;

The company ceased operation in 1971, after financial troubles, including with the Internal Revenue Service; and Bruce Meyers himself had already left his own company by then. 

==Meyers Manx, Inc.==
In 2000, Bruce Meyers created a resurgence of interest by founding Meyers Manx, Inc., based in Valley Center, California, and offering the Classic Manx series, a limited edition of 100.

In 2002, the Manxter 2+2 and Manxter DualSport were born. These two new models are modernizations of the original design, but are sized for a full-length Beetle pan (and the DualSport can also be based on a Super Beetle pan, unlike any other Manx model). Custom versions for higher-power engines and other variations are also available.

In the spring of 2009, Meyers re-introduced the shortened wheelbase. Named the Manx after the last action a surfer performs before reaching the shore, it is available in two models. The Kick-Out Manx Traditional is an updated version of the original Manx concept, with wider fenders, plus a front-hinged hood providing extra storage and easier access to electricals. The Kick-Out Manx (a.k.a. Kick-Out S.S. Manx) version is much more modern, with headlights flared into the hood, curved windshield, sculpted rear deck cover and twin roll hoops.

, no Meyers Manx kits are based on the New Beetle or other modern Volkswagen cars, only particular original Beetle and Super Beetle models, which are rear-engine and rear-wheel-drive. No Meyers Manx kits are based on front-engine, front-wheel-drive platforms. Aftermarket frames are available, designed to duplicate VW chassis dimensions but provide improvements such as more modern or more rugged components.

==Meyers Manx, LLC==
On 9 November 2020 it was announced that Bruce and Winnie Meyers had sold their business to venture capital investment firm Trousdale Ventures, who named automotive designer Freeman Thomas as CEO. The new company would be called Meyers Manx, LLC.

==Electric version==
Meyers Manx 2.0 EV, dual-motor RWD 202hp BEV, 0-60 in 4.5 seconds, 40 kWh battery 300 mile range.

Meyers Manx Resorter (LWB NEV), 4-seater.

<text>Turma do Balão Mágico (&quot;English: The Magic Balloon Gang&quot;) was a Brazilian children&#x27;s music group active between 1982 and 1986. The children also starred the TV show, &quot;Balão Mágico&quot;.

The group released six albums under the Columbia label, together selling a total of 13 million copies and drawing up to 60,000 people in concerts. Their biggest hit is the song &quot;Superfantástico&quot; or &quot;Superfantastic&quot;.

==Members==
* Simony (Simony Benelli Galasso): The only girl in the band;
* Tob (Vimerson Canavilas Benedicto): The oldest member of the group;
* Mike (Michael Biggs): Son of infamous British robber Ronnie Biggs;
* Jairzinho (Jair Oliveira): Son of Brazilian musician Jair Rodrigues;
* Ricardinho (Ricardo Batista): The last member to join the group.

== History ==
===Group beginnings===
In 1981, Simony Benelli appeared on television singing on the television show Raul Gil. After the positive responses, she (about 5 years of age ) was invited by Tomas Muñoz to form a musical group. In the same year, Vímerson Cavanillas Benedicto appeared at freshmen shows, called &quot;calouros&quot; in Brazil, and was a success in commercials and parades. When he knew that he would make a child group, his brother brought him for a test in the recording company. Having passed, he was immediately invited to form a &quot;duo&quot; with Simony, who already agreed. 

With the group in his hands, the songs were recorded immediately, with Edgard Poças writing the lyrics, saying that he should &quot;translate&quot; lyrics that were successful outside of Brazil. 

Accepting the proposal, Edgard tried to avoid what the recording company was saying, getting the rhythms and creating his own lyrics, mixing with some lyrics from famous Brazilian songs. Thus, &quot;A Turma do Balão Mágico&quot; was born. Not long after, after the album was finished, Ronald Biggs was kidnapped and brought to the Caribbean, and his son, Michael Biggs, said on national TV for his father to be brought back, moving the entire country. Munõz therefore called Ronald and asked if Michael knew how to sing, mostly saying that he only knew how to sing &quot;Oh, Suzana&quot;, while playing. In response, Munõz removed the song from the disc and recorded a solo with Michael, who received the affectionate nickname of Mike.

Vímerson Cavanillas was too much of a complicated name for children, so the recording company picked the last syllable of his name (Benedicto) and joined it with the first, forming &quot;Tobe&quot; or Tob. 

With the three boys, the record was released in 1982, selling over a million copies. There was also a clown mask as a bonus with the LP. &quot;O Balão Mágico&quot; then started to do shows all over Brazil, accompanied by a gigantic technical team and clowns.

=== Second album and program on Globo ===
Thanks to the huge success that the first album had achieved, CBS made the group its priority and Munõz took charge of assembling a second album, calling Edgard Poças again to assemble it. The repertoire focused more on school, friends and romance (an evolution granted by Edgard to accompany the growth of children). Edgard was instructed to make a more pop and dance record, with few elements of MPB. Every time he tried to incorporate the genre into the arrangements, he was greeted with comments like &quot;Oh! Here comes Tom Jobim&quot;. Renowned guest appearances were called, like Djavan (in the track &quot;Superfantástico&quot;), Baby Consuelo (&quot;Together&quot;) and an improved arrangement. Released in September 1983, the second album broke a record: In the Christmas week alone, the record sold over 1 million copies, growing every time. The success was so great that Balão had won a program on Rede Globo (in March 1983) and received a major upgrade, with more animations, longer runtime, etc. It was also in Balão Mágico that Orival Pessini created a character just for children that until today is a national reference for all ages, the Fofão, an alien and intergalactic being, a mixture of man, dog, pig, clown, ET and others.

=== Television success, new member and third album ===
With a record in hand and the daily program proposal on the country&#x27;s main broadcaster readily accepted, A Turma do Balão Mágico was preparing for this moment, amid shows and program presentations, to release a new album. For the new repertoire, the label was looking for a new member, to debut with the new phase of Balão. During this preparation, something happened in Italy: Jair Oliveira sang on a television program with his father, Jair Rodrigues, the success &quot;Io e Te&quot;. On his return to Brazil, Jair Rodrigues already had an appointment scheduled with the rekwown soccer player Pelé. With the cancellation of Pelé&#x27;s participation, the boy had to sing alone, leaving the crowd gaping. The record company took advantage of the situation and invited him to join the group and so he took the place, of what would have been a girl, at the premiere of the program. Jair Oliveira, nicknamed Jairzinho, was the big addition. In the same year, Simony was crucial to the return of the group Os Trapalhões as a quartet.

The children were growing up fast; Tob, then 13, no longer fit with children&#x27;s songs, while Simony (8) and Mike (10) also grew up. Knowing this, CBS decided to revamp the group and invited Edgard Poças to produce the new album, and he then made a repertoire with songs aimed at teenagers. For the great romantic focus of the album, the song &quot;Se Enamora&quot; was recorded, a success abroad (El Amore) and also imported here. With Tob and Simony as the main performers, the album had 12 songs and a mini toy theatre was added to put together as a bonus gift.

In September 1984, Turma do Balão Mágico&#x27;s third album debuted. For most people, it is the group&#x27;s best album, once again breaking records, and its hits continued to play on radio and TV. O Balão had finally achieved absolute success, and reigned in the child / youth audience. The demand for new shows increased, along with the audience of the television program. With all this success, the Balloon also carried out an advertisement for vaccination against rabies. In the following month, celebrating Children&#x27;s Month, Rede Globo exhibited a special of the Magic Balloon Group, entitled &quot; The Magic Balloon Group em Amigos do Peito &quot;, which was a program by Augusto César Vannucci, was created by Stil, Edi Newton and Paulo Netto, written by Wilson Rocha, directed by Paulo Netto. Augusto César Vannucci was still the general director of the program.

With all this success, what the producers did not know was that the following year would be a year of intense profound changes in the band, which would eventually lead to the end of the intense and successful career.

=== Tob&#x27;s departure, Ricardinho&#x27;s entry and fourth album ===
After the resounding success of Turma do Balão Mágico in the previous year, CBS bet everything on the band. The program leveraged high ratings, and the third album was still breaking sales records. Som Livre brought together the biggest members of MPB for the recording of a special disc in celebration of the genre, among them was Balão Mágico. In the same year, Tob, then 14 years old, was going through a sudden change of voice. The MPB record was recorded, and Balão re-recorded the song &quot;A Banda&quot;, by Chico Buarque.

Achieving more and more success, the fourth LP started to be produced and assembled. In the program, the games continued and the audience continued to rise. But in the second half of 1985, O Balão suffered a great drop; owing to the change of voice and the sudden growth of the member, CBS would remove Tob from Balão Mágico and from the Globo program, replacing him with Ricardinho, a new 10-year-old member who had made his debut in the group. With the sudden low and an LP in production, Simony, Jairzinho, Mike and Ricardinho recorded the fourth album. The LP was a commercial success, with gifts being a check to open a savings account at Caixa and a toy merry-go-round to assemble. Despite the success in public and sales, the Balloon started to lose its gas, having to suffer the consequences of the new formation.

Rede Globo aired a special by Turma do Balão Mágico, entitled &quot; A Turma do Balão Mágico Nº 2 &quot;. The Special was a program by Augusto Cesar Vannucci, written by Daltony Nóbrega and Stil, final written by Wilson Rocha, edited by João Henrique Schiller, directed by Vicente Burger, directed by Paulo Netto and directed by Augusto Cesar Vannucci.

Sales began to decline, and with members growing rapidly, the year 1986 would mark the end of Turma do Balão Mágico.

=== Fifth album and end of group ===
In March 1986 Simony left Rede Globo – but not the group – to have a deal with another TV company, Rede Manchete, where she would present her solo program, the &quot; Nave da Fantasia&quot;. At the same time, Mike and Ricardinho decided to leave the group and television program. With that, Rede Globo decided to end children&#x27;s programming, however, as&quot; Xou da Xuxa &quot;would start in June in the same timeslot, or program was presented for just these three months only by Jairzinho, Castrinho and Ticiane Pinheiro, who came from Band, where he hosted the &quot;TV Criança&quot;. In Mike and Ricardinho&#x27;s places, Luciana Benelli, Simony&#x27;s cousin who already participated in the television program, and Luciana Mello, Jairzinho&#x27;s sister, joined. Orival Pessini signed a contract with Band, where he hosted &quot;TV Fofão&quot;. The fifth and last album, &quot; A Turma do Balão Mágico &quot; was released in October together with a tour across Brazil until December, when the group officially ended .

=== Group&#x27;s return in 2018 ===
The program &quot;Balão Mágico&quot; turned 35, on March 7, 2018. Former members of Turma do Balão Mágico, Mike, Tob and Simony without Jair Oliveira, Castrinho, Fofão, Luciana and Ricardinho, returned to perform together in April 2018, with several appearances on television shows, concerts and festivals.

=== Documentary ===
Star+ released a documentary about the band.

<doc id="1299404" wikidata="Q42139305" url="?curid=1299404" title="Feature (machine learning)">
<text>In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a data set. Choosing informative, discriminating, and independent features is crucial to produce effective algorithms for pattern recognition, classification, and regression tasks. Features are usually numeric, but other types such as strings and graphs are used in syntactic pattern recognition, after some pre-processing step such as one-hot encoding. The concept of &quot;features&quot; is related to that of explanatory variables used in statistical techniques such as linear regression.

==Feature types==
In feature engineering, two types of features are commonly used: numerical and categorical.

Numerical features are continuous values that can be measured on a scale. Examples of numerical features include age, height, weight, and income. Numerical features can be used in machine learning algorithms directly.

Categorical features are discrete values that can be grouped into categories. Examples of categorical features include gender, color, and zip code. Categorical features typically need to be converted to numerical features before they can be used in machine learning algorithms. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding.

The type of feature that is used in feature engineering depends on the specific machine learning algorithm that is being used. Some machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, can handle both numerical and categorical features. Other machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, can only handle numerical features.

==Classification==

A numeric feature can be conveniently described by a feature vector. One way to achieve binary classification is using a linear predictor function (related to the perceptron) with a feature vector as input. The method consists of calculating the scalar product between the feature vector and a vector of weights, qualifying those observations whose result exceeds a threshold.
Algorithms for classification from a feature vector include nearest neighbor classification, neural networks, and statistical techniques such as Bayesian approaches.

==Examples==

In character recognition, features may include histograms counting the number of black pixels along horizontal and vertical directions, number of internal holes, stroke detection and many others.

In speech recognition, features for recognizing phonemes can include noise ratios, length of sounds, relative power, filter matches and many others.

In spam detection algorithms, features may include the presence or absence of certain email headers, 
the email structure, the language, the frequency of specific terms, the grammatical correctness of the text.

In computer vision, there are a large number of possible features, such as edges and objects.

==Feature vectors==
In pattern recognition and machine learning, a feature vector is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object. Many algorithms in machine learning require a numerical representation of objects, since such representations facilitate processing and statistical analysis. When representing images, the feature values might correspond to the pixels of an image, while when representing texts the features might be the frequencies of occurrence of textual terms. Feature vectors are equivalent to the vectors of explanatory variables used in statistical procedures such as linear regression. Feature vectors are often combined with weights using a dot product in order to construct a linear predictor function that is used to determine a score for making a prediction.

The vector space associated with these vectors is often called the feature space. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques can be employed.

Higher-level features can be obtained from already available features and added to the feature vector; for example, for the study of diseases the feature &#x27;Age&#x27; is useful and is defined as &quot;Age = &#x27;Year of death&#x27; minus &#x27;Year of birth&#x27; &quot;. This process is referred to as feature construction. Feature construction is the application of a set of constructive operators to a set of existing features resulting in construction of new features. Examples of such constructive operators include checking for the equality conditions {=, ≠}, the arithmetic operators {+,−,×, /}, the array operators {max(S), min(S), average(S)} as well as other more sophisticated operators, for example count(S,C) that counts the number of features in the feature vector S satisfying some condition C or, for example, distances to other recognition classes generalized by some accepting device. Feature construction has long been considered a powerful tool for increasing both accuracy and understanding of structure, particularly in high-dimensional problems. Applications include studies of disease and emotion recognition from speech.

==Selection and extraction==
The initial set of raw features can be redundant and large enough that estimation and optimization is made difficult or ineffective. Therefore, a preliminary step in many applications of machine learning and pattern recognition consists of selecting a subset of features, or constructing a new and reduced set of features to facilitate learning, and to improve generalization and interpretability.

Extracting or selecting features is a combination of art and science; developing systems to do so is known as feature engineering. It requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and the combination of automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert. Automating this process is feature learning, where a machine not only uses features for learning, but learns the features itself.

<text>Kaarlo Pentti Linkola (7 December 1932 in Helsinki – 5 April 2020) was a prominent Finnish deep ecologist, ornithologist, polemicist, naturalist, writer, and fisherman. He wrote widely about his ideas and in Finland was a prominent thinker, and is linked by some authors to ecofascism and to authoritarian deep ecology. Linkola was a year-round fisherman from 1959 to 1995. He fished on Keitele, Päijänne and the Gulf of Finland, and since 1978 he fished on Vanajavesi.

Linkola blamed humans for the continuous degradation of the environment. He promoted rapid population decline to combat the problems commonly attributed to overpopulation. Linkola also defended an end to immigration, the reversion to pre-industrial life ways, and authoritarian measures to keep human life within strict limits.

==Biography==
Linkola was born on 7 December 1932. He grew up in Helsinki and summered in Kariniemi in Tyrväntö at the farm of his maternal grandfather, Hugo Suolahti. His father, Kaarlo Linkola, was a botanist, phytogeographer, and the Rector of University of Helsinki, and his grandfather Hugo had worked as the chancellor of that same university. Linkola&#x27;s half-brother, Anssi, was killed during the Continuation War against the Soviet Union in 1941, at the age of 20. One year after Anssi died, Kaarlo died of prostate cancer. Hugo then died in 1944 due to a heart attack. Linkola had an elder sister, Aira, and a younger brother, Martti.

After he graduated from Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu in 1950, Linkola studied biology for half a year, then abandoned academic studies to become an independent researcher. He lived in Signilskär in Åland and made ornithological observations. Although he was one of Finland&#x27;s most famous ornithologists, Linkola started to live an austere life as a fisherman, as this was in line with his teachings. He was involved in the Koijärvi Movement that started in 1979, but his views proved too radical for mainstream Green politics.

In 1995, Linkola founded the Finnish Natural Heritage Foundation (), which concentrates on preserving the few ancient forests still left in southern Finland and other nature conservation. The foundation receives donations from private individuals and companies, then purchases forest areas deemed unique enough to deserve protection. By 2017, the foundation had purchased 62 protected areas, spanning in total. On the 101st anniversary of Finland&#x27;s independence, Linkola was announced as the winner of a poll conducted by the national broadcaster Yle to determine who had done the most to preserve Finland&#x27;s natural heritage.

Linkola was married from 1961 to 1975, and had two children. He died in his sleep at his home in Sääksmäki on 5 April 2020.

==Ideas==
Linkola&#x27;s views have been sometimes described as &quot;ecofascist&quot;. He believed that democracy was a mistake, saying he preferred dictatorships, and only radical change can prevent ecological collapse. He contended that the human populations of the world, regardless if they are developed or underdeveloped, do not deserve to survive at the expense of the biosphere as a whole. In May 1994, Linkola was featured on the front page of &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;. He said he was for a radical reduction in the world population and was quoted as saying about a future world war, &quot;If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating, if it meant millions of people would die.&quot;

Linkola&#x27;s writings describe in emotional detail the environmental degradation he witnessed. He dedicated his 1979 (&quot;From the Diary of a Dissident&quot;) to German far-left militants Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, stating that &quot;they are the signposts, not Jesus of Nazareth or Albert Schweitzer&quot;. He supported acts of terrorism such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings as he viewed them as disruptions to a society that is responsible for the degradation of the Earth. When asked in 2007 why he had not himself become a terrorist, Linkola said that he lacked the ability and bravery.

Linkola was pleased to see the rise of Greta Thunberg, a Swedish activist seventy years younger: &quot;I follow very closely what is said about her. After all, she&#x27;s even a great girl in a little crazy way. Let&#x27;s see how long she can still fight.&quot;

==Reception==

In the 2009 book &quot;Environmental Change and Foreign Policy: Theory and Practice&quot;, Mika Merviö, Professor of International Relations at the Kibi International University, contended that while most environmentalists in Finland distanced themselves from Linkola, those concerned about the environment avidly read his writings. Merviö said that Linkola represents &quot;a very Finnish and dark version of &#x27;an inconvenient truth&#x27;.&quot;

After Linkola&#x27;s death, the incumbent Minister for Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto and Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Krista Mikkonen, both from the Green League, expressed their condolences and praised Linkola&#x27;s significant efforts for nature conservation. Haavisto said that Linkola had influenced generations of environmentalists, and while Linkola did not defend human rights, there never was disagreement about conservation.

<text>The Badawiyyah, Sufi tariqah, was founded in the thirteenth century in Egypt by Ahmad al-Badawi (1199-1276). As a tariqah, the Badawiyyah lacks any distinct doctrines.

It was, however, extremely popular during both the Mamluk and Ottoman periods of Egypt. Mamluk Sultans often supported elaborate &#x27;Mawlids&#x27; at the resting place of Shaykh Ahmed al-Badawi (or &quot;Sayyid Badawi&quot; as he is more commonly known) in the Nile Delta town of Tanta.

During the Ottoman period, this order spread to Turkey and there were several Tekkes or zawiyas in Istanbul many of which survived until the founding of the Turkish republic.

The mawlid of Sayyid Badawi is still celebrated in Egypt every year where the population of Tanta swells to almost double. Tents are placed in the streets around the Mosque of Sayyid Badawi where Qur&#x27;an recitations and sermons by important scholars from al-Azhar Mosque are delivered.

<text>Trem da Alegria (Train of Happiness) was a children&#x27;s musical band based in Brazil. During their tenure from 1984 to 1992, they released eight albums whose total sales surpassed six million copies.

The band started in 1984 with Luciano Nassyn and Patricia Marx, recording the album &quot;Clube da Criança&quot; with Xuxa and Carequinha. The duo&#x27;s boom came with the album &quot;Carossel da Esperança&quot; and the hit single &quot;É de Chocolate&quot;.

Trem da Alegria&#x27;s &quot;members were &#x27;recruited by advertising agencies&#x27;&quot;. In 1985, after Juninho Bill joined the band, they recorded their first album, &quot;Trem da Alegria do Clube da Criança&quot;, which featured guest performers Lucinha Lins (&quot;Dona Felicidade&quot;) and The Fevers (&quot;Uni, Duni, Te&quot;). 
Trem was among Brazil&#x27;s top-selling artists during 1987, along with Xuxa and Jairzinho e Simony.

<text>Goan literature is the literature pertaining to the state of Goa in India.

Goa has a population of around 1.4 million and an area of 3,700 sq. kilometres (1,430 sq. miles). For a small region, it has a significant amount of publication activity, possibly in part because its people write in a number of languages—perhaps as many as 13—and also because of the large expatriate and diaspora population of Goans settled across the globe.

Among its most noted writers are Laxmanrao Sardessai (1904–1986) and R. V. Pandit (1917–1990), both of whom wrote poetry and prose in Marathi, Konkani, and Portuguese; Shenoi Goembab (1877–1946), whose Konkani writing helped to establish Konkani as a modern literary language; Ravindra Kelekar (1925–2010), who wrote some of the twentieth century&#x27;s foremost Konkani literature; and Pundalik Naik (born 1952), whose 1977 novel &quot;Acchev&quot; was the first Konkani novel to be translated into English.

== History ==

Goa was the first place in Asia to have a printing press, which was brought by the Jesuits in 1556. Nearly all of Goan literature before that time is known to have been destroyed by the Portuguese during the imposition of Inquisition. Goa&#x27;s Portuguese colonial rulers can hardly be credited with meticulous record-keeping of Goan literature. Thus, Goa has had a long love affair with the written and printed word, although growth has been slow, and punctuated by problems like linguistic breaks and censorship.

In 1886, Tipografia Rangel, one of the pioneers in widescale publishing was founded. Prior to this the only existing presses were those of the government and individual family presses existing to print the political newspapers. Tipografia Rangel was among the leaders in providing print media and promoting literature to a larger section of society in Goa.

Peter Nazareth points out that Goans have written in thirteen languages, of which the chief are Konkani, Marathi, English and Portuguese. Nazareth describes Goans as &#x27;cultural brokers&#x27;:

Goans mediate between cultures, Goans live between different cultures, Goans are travellers from one part of the world to another. This, in my opinion, happened when East and West met in Goans under pressure with the Portuguese conquest. Since that time, our usefulness to the world, wherever we are, is that we can understand different cultures and help people from different cultures understand one another. The disadvantage is that if we don&#x27;t work on it, we may end up not knowing who we are.

Literary writing in Goa began to take shape under Portuguese rule and influence, associated with Portugal&#x27;s mid-nineteenth-century Regeneration, which saw the reintroduction of the press to Goa, along with expanded Portuguese education. A spate of Portuguese-language publications, &#x27;such as &quot;A Biblioteca de Goa&quot; (1839), &quot;O Enciclopédico&quot; (1841–1842), &quot;O Compilador&quot; (1843–1847), &quot;O Gabinete Literário das Fontainhas&quot; (1846–1848), &quot;A revista Ilustrativa&quot; (1857–1866) and &quot;O Arquivo Portugués Oriental&quot; (1857–1866)&#x27;, along with Júlio Gonçalves&#x27;s &quot;Ilustraçao Goana&quot; (1864–1866), while often short-lived, provided new fora not only for the circulation of European literature (whether originally in Portuguese or in translation), but provided growing opportunities for Goans to publish literary and scholarly writing.

The first novel published by a Goan was &quot;Os Brahamanes&quot; (&quot;The Brahmans&quot;) by Francisco Luis Gomes, published in 1866.

Later in the nineteenth century, vernacular writing began to emerge in strength, for example in Konkani, the widely spoken local vernacular. The Goan writer Shenoi Goembab (1877–1946) was foundational to developing modern Konkani literature. An official language of the region since 1987, Konkani is now studied in schools. Konkani literature emerged alongside the rapid growth of Marathi literature, in which the Goan R. V. Pandit was a notable exponent. S. M. Tadkodkar, who was conferred PhD degree by Goa University for his exhaustive research work on Anant Kaakaba Priolkar, contends that while the Kannadd language of Karnataka province was dominating the Goan culture, Marathi language and culture was embraced by Goans. Now, Marathi has embraced the Goans and would not leave them, willingly. Maximum literature is published in Marathi. There are 8 Marathi dailies published from Goa. Prominent among them are &quot;Dianik Gomantak&quot;, &quot;Tarun Bharat&quot;, &quot;Lokamat&quot;, &quot;Navaprabha&quot;, &quot;Pudhari&quot;, &quot;Goadoot&quot;. The Marathi daily &quot;Lokmat&quot; has the highest circulation (50000+) among all dailies.

In the late nineteenth century, extensive contacts with and migration to British-ruled India also encouraged English-language Goan writing, with early exponents including Joseph Furtado. Edward D&#x27;Lima, who has done his PhD on the Goan writer Armando Menezes, argues that Goan writing in English goes back to the late nineteenth century, when Goans were migrating out of this Portuguese-controlled colony in favour of jobs in the growing English-speaking British-ruled colonial world. English is probably the most influential literary language in Goa: &#x27;a surge of creativity has erupted in Goan literature in English since 2000 in fiction and nonfiction, drama and poetry&#x27;.

==Goan writers==
Besides English, Konkani and Marathi, Goans, particularly those of the past generation, have contributed significantly to writings in Portuguese.

<doc id="1299426" wikidata="Q773312" url="?curid=1299426" title="Třeboň">
<text>Třeboň (; ) is a spa town in Jindřichův Hradec District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 8,300 inhabitants. The historic town centre with the castle complex is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Třeboň consists of eight municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Třeboň I (361)
*Třeboň II (5,712)
*Branná (368)
*Břilice (814)
*Holičky (214)
*Nová Hlína (134)
*Přeseka (120)
*Stará Hlína (228)
==Etymology==
The name is derived from the personal name Třeboň (shortened variant of the name Třebohost or Třebomysl).

==Geography==

Třeboň is located about southwest of Jindřichův Hradec and east of České Budějovice. It lies in the Třeboň Basin. It is known for its bogs with rich deposits of peat, which led to establishment of peat spa in the town.

Třeboň is known for its fish ponds, which were established in the region since Middle Ages. Rožmberk Pond is the largest pond in the country and the largest fish pond in the world, with surface area of . It was built between 1584 and 1590. The urban area of Třeboň is located on the shore of Svět pond, also one of the largest Czech ponds with . It is primarily a fish pond, but also is used for sport and recreational purposes.

The whole municipal territory lies in the Třeboňsko Protected Landscape Area. The Lužnice river flows through the eastern part of the territory and supplies Rožmberk pond with water. There are many small watercourses, which supply the other ponds.

==History==

Třeboň was established around the middle of the 12th century. Around 1300, Třeboň was already fortified. In 1341, it was first referred to as a town. In 1366, Třeboň&#x27;s Czech name first appeared, and the Rosenberg family became owner of the estate. During their rule, the town gained importance and wealth. In 1376, Třeboň gained royal town privileges. At the end of the 14th century, the fortifications strengthened, which helped resist attacks during the Hussite Wars.

The greatest development occurred in the 16th and early 17th centuries, when Jakub Krčín was at the head of the Rosenberg family business and started to establish new ponds in the area. The region became famous as a fish pond farming area. The end of prosperity came with extinction of the Rosenberg family, troop invasions, and several large fires. Třeboň further suffered during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when it was held by a regiment of Scots led by Colonel Sir John Seton from 1620 to early 1622. From 1660 to the 20th century, the House of Schwarzenberg owned the town and the estate.

The town slowly recovered and remained economically unimportant until the 19th century, when it became a district town. Until 1918, &quot;Třeboň – Wittingau&quot; was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district with the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

After World War II, the first larger industry (clothing factory and large-scale agricultural production) was established in the town. In 1960, the Třeboň district was abolished and the town received spa status.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

Třeboň is a tourist destination, and this is the area&#x27;s major economic activity, along with agriculture, the spa industry and other services. 

The State Regional Archive for South Bohemia is based here, where genealogical studies about people born in the South Bohemian Region may be conducted. The archive was held at the 15th-century Třeboň castle for many years, although a substantial portion was moved to the municipal offices in 2014.

===Spa===

The spa company &quot;Slatinné lázně Třeboň&quot; is the largest employer in the town. The peat spa in Třeboň focuses on the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, rheumatic problems, and post-injury and post-surgery reconvalescence. The first modern spa in Třeboň was opened in 1883.

==Transport==
Třeboň lies at the crossroads of two important roads: the I/24 (which connects the D3 motorway with the Czech-German border in Halámky, part of the European route E49). and the I/34 (the section from České Budějovice to Jindřichův Hradec, part of the European route E551).

Třeboň is located on the major international railway line Prague–Vienna.

==Culture==
The International Festival of Animated Films Anifest was held in Třeboň each May between 2002 and 2010; after that, Anifilm took its place.

==Sights==
The natural centre of the town&#x27;s historic core is Masarykovo Square. It is surrounded by burgher houses with Renaissance and Baroque facades. In the centre there are a Renaissance stone fountain from 1569, and a Baroque Marian column. The main landmark is the Old Town Hall, built in 1563. In 1638, a massive quadrangular high tower was added to the town hall.

Třeboň Castle is a Renaissance castle. A small stone castle in Třeboň was first mentioned in 1374. The current castle was created in 1565–1575 by reconstruction of old castle buildings damaged by fire. The castle includes an English-style castle park.

The Church of Our Lady Queen and Saint Giles is the largest building in the complex of the former Augustinian monastery. The monastery was founded in 1367 by the Rosenberg family and construction of the church began the same year. The monastery was abolished in 1785.

The entrance to the town was guarded by massive gates, which are together with the fragments of the town walls preserved to this day.

<text>The Ituri Rainforest (French: &quot;Forêt tropicale de l’Ituri&quot;) is a rainforest located in the Ituri Province of northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The forest&#x27;s name derives from the nearby Ituri River which flows through the rainforest, connecting firstly to the Aruwimi River and finally into the Congo.

==Geography==
The Ituri Rainforest is about in area, and is located between 0° and 3°N and 27° and 30° E. Elevation in the Ituri ranges from about . The climate is warm and humid, as exemplified by the nearby city of Bunia, which however is at a slightly higher elevation. About one-fifth of the rainforest is made up of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a World Heritage Site.

It is also the home of the Mbuti pygmies, one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below , on average). They have been the subject of research by a variety of outsiders, including Patrick and Anne Eisner Putnam, who lived on the banks of the at the edge of the Ituri. They were also the subject of a well-known study by Colin Turnbull, &quot;The Forest People&quot;, which was published in 1962.

The Ituri rainforest was first traversed by Europeans in 1887 by Henry Morton Stanley on his Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.

<doc id="1299441" wikidata="Q2225721" url="?curid=1299441" title="River Ver">
<text>The Ver is a long chalk stream in Hertfordshire, England. It is a tributary of the River Colne.

==Course==
The source is in the grounds of Lynch Lodge, Kensworth Lynch on the west side of the A5 trunk road and stays on the west side for some half mile or so. It then crosses through a culvert into Markyate Cell, afterwards crosses under the A5 in culvert and runs through Markyate. The river exits above ground at the southern end of Markyate, and on through Flamstead, Redbourn, St Albans and Park Street, finally joining the River Colne at Bricket Wood.

The Ver is a chalk stream, which is partly a seasonal winterbourne north of Redbourn. However, many of its natural features have been compromised as a result of being canalised during the construction of the artificial lakes at Verulamium Park in St Albans in the 1930s following the archaeological excavations of Verulamium by Sir Mortimer Wheeler and his wife Tessa. During the 1960s and 1970s it suffered serious problems as a result of water extraction upstream. Although these abated temporarily after the closure of one of the pumping stations, the upstream part of the river dries up completely during the summer, and the rest of the river may suffer the same fate within a few years; compared to the current situation with the &quot;great flow of water&quot; that was reported to exist in 1885, with a depth of at Dolittle Mill on the Redbourn Road . In 2004 a proposal for remedial work was being developed for the St Albans lakes.

==Notable buildings==
The Romans built the city of Verulamium alongside the Ver at a time when it was navigable, expressing their preference for building in valleys rather than on hills.

The bridge in St Michael&#x27;s Street, adjacent to Kingsbury Mill, dates from 1765 and is believed to be the oldest extant bridge in Hertfordshire. It is Grade II listed. According to a contemporary account of the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, another bridge existed on this site previously (recorded in 1505 as &quot;Pons de la Maltemyll&quot; - Malt Mill Bridge). It is thought that the Romans had built a bridge here by the 3rd century AD. The ford alongside the current bridge, which is known to have existed for 2,000 years and is traditionally believed to be Alban&#x27;s crossing point on his way to his execution, was substantially restored in 2001 by local residents&#x27; associations.

&quot;Ye Olde Fighting Cocks&quot; public house in St Albans, which claims to be the oldest pub in England, was moved in the early 1600s to the side of the Ver next to the Abbey Mill at the bottom of the Abbey Orchard, and remains in this location today.

==Industry==

The river south of Redbourn has been the site of several watermills down the centuries, mainly for grinding corn but also put to such diverse uses as paper making, fulling cloth, silk spinning and diamond lapping. Eleven mills are known to have existed, of which a number can still be seen today, either as mills (working or otherwise), or converted (for example into private homes or parts of public houses). Particularly worthy of note are:

:*Dolittle Mill. Closed in 1927 and since demolished. It is reputed to have been the site of a miracle. The early 15th century chronicler Thomas Walsingham, a monk at St Albans Abbey, records that a child fell into the mill race and was thrown out by the wheel, apparently dead. The child&#x27;s mother prayed to Saint Alban, offering money if the child&#x27;s life were restored, and her prayer was answered.

:*Redbournbury Mill, between Redbourn and St Albans. A recently restored flour mill, still producing flour commercially, is periodically open to the public. However, these days it is powered by a vintage Crossley diesel engine. It is a Grade II* listed building.

:*Kingsbury Watermill. A 16th century mill in St Albans which was previously a malt mill belonging to St Albans Abbey. Its origins are known to go back to at least 1194; indeed, it may be one of the three mills in St Albans recorded in the Domesday Book (1086). Today it is restored and open as a museum. It is another Grade II* listed building.

:*Moor Mill, in Smug Oak Lane, Bricket Wood. Now a public house and conference centre. The water wheel and other workings can still be seen inside during normal opening hours.

:*Shafford Mill, a 19th century mill on the Redbourn Road, is now a private house. It is a Grade II listed building.

Disused watercress beds can be seen at various points along the river&#x27;s length (most notably in the unspoilt stretch between Redbourn and St Albans): the entire Ver valley was a national centre for the watercress growing industry. The poplar and willow plantations around Pre Mill and the former Pre Hotel on the A5183 (just west of St Albans on the edge of the Gorhambury Estate), which are a significant feature of the landscape, indicate a more modern industry: that of cricket bat manufacturing.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

<doc id="1299442" wikidata="Q2746222" url="?curid=1299442" title="Sleeping Beauty Castle">
<text>Sleeping Beauty Castle is a fairy tale castle at the center of Disneyland and formerly at Hong Kong Disneyland. It is based on the late 19th century Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany. It appeared in the Walt Disney Pictures logos from 1985 to 2006 before being merged with Cinderella Castle, both familiar symbols of the Walt Disney Company. The version at Disneyland is the only Disney castle whose construction was overseen by Walt Disney.

A redesigned and larger version of the castle is used as the symbol of Disneyland Paris.

==Disneyland==


Opened July 17, 1955, the castle is the oldest of all Disney castles. Though it reaches a height of , it was designed by Roland E. Hill to appear taller through the forced perspective technique; design elements are larger at the foundation and smaller at the turrets. The castle initially featured an empty upper level that was never intended to house an attraction, but Walt Disney was not satisfied with what he viewed as wasted space, and challenged his Imagineers to find some use for the space.

Beginning on April 29, 1957, the visitors were able to walk through the castle and view several dioramas depicting the story of Sleeping Beauty. The voice of Jiminy Cricket from Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) singing &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; is piped into the castle. The original dioramas were designed in the style of Eyvind Earle, production designer for Disney&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (released nearly four years after the Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle was opened), and were then redone in 1977 to resemble the window displays on Main Street, U.S.A. The walkthrough was closed for unspecified reasons on October 7, 2001; popular belief claims the September 11th attacks and the potential danger that ensued played a major factor in the closing. Disney spokesman John McClintock said that the 9–11 attacks rumors were not true. &quot;I am aware of those rumors,&quot; he said. &quot;But in 2001, it really wasn&#x27;t resonating with guests. In the late 90s, early 2000s, arguably the most popular thing about Sleeping Beauty was that you could always get in because nobody went to it.&quot;

On July 17, 2008, Disney announced that the Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough would reopen in the style of the original Earle dioramas, enhanced with new technology. The walkthrough reopened on November 27, 2008 at 5:00 p.m., drawing long lines going as far back as the Hub at the center of the park. Unlike previous incarnations, visitors who are unable to climb stairs or navigate the passageways of the Castle can still experience the walkthrough &quot;virtually&quot; in a special room on the Castle&#x27;s ground floor. This room is lavishly themed, and presents the closed-captioned CGI walkthrough recreation on a high-definition TV. This same virtual recreation is included on the &quot;Sleeping Beauty &quot; 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition DVD.

The castle walkthrough entrance is on the west side of the building inside Fantasyland. Guests first see a large medieval-themed story book open to a page that announces the birth of the princess Aurora. After climbing the stairs inside, a scene depicts Aurora as a baby, being blessed with magic gifts by her fairy godmothers. Behind a glass window, there is an animation of the castle courtyard, and the king and queen watching as a large fire burns all the spinning wheels in the kingdom. At the top of the stairs, as guests reach the center of the castle&#x27;s top level, another window looks out on the castle&#x27;s great hall, where everyone in the kingdom is asleep, including servants and the cat and dog. The second half of the walkthrough becomes darker, featuring appearances by Maleficent, her crow, and several gargoyles which fly out of her nearby castle. At the end, the prince fights against Maleficent&#x27;s incarnation as a dragon, amid a forest of thorny brambles, and then a field of roses appears with doves flying above, as he kisses Aurora and breaks the spell. As guests exit the walkthrough at the bottom of the stairs on the east side of the castle, another medieval-themed oversized book depicts an image of the prince and princess dancing together, as her dress changes colors from pink to blue and back again.
The Disney family coat of arms hangs above the archway to the castle. It is composed of three lions passant in pale. It is known that the coat of arms was not originally on the castle, but was placed there sometime between June 1965 and July 1965.

At the rear of the castle, shaded by the archways and driven into the ground is a gold spike that is widely, but wrongly, believed to mark the geographical center of Disneyland. In reality, the spike is a surveyor&#x27;s mark that was used to ensure that the castle bridge and entrance lined up with Main Street USA when the park was first constructed. The original geographical center of the Magic Kingdom was in the middle of the round park, where the &quot;Partners&quot; statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse stands. The addition of Mickey&#x27;s Toontown in 1993 moved the actual center of the park a few yards northward, but still on the hub side of the castle drawbridge.

===The Happiest Homecoming on Earth (2005)===
In celebration of Disneyland&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Sleeping Beauty Castle received a makeover. The castle was repainted and five turrets were decorated with stylized crowns, each representing a decade in the park&#x27;s history:
*The creation of Disneyland is represented by a pair of famous &quot;Ears&quot; peeking up over the horizon to see the wonders to come.
*&quot;A World on the Move&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;New Tomorrowland&quot; of 1967, is represented by rocket ships and accented by opalescent planets.
*The Blue Fairy represents the debut of the Main Street Electrical Parade (which was running at California Adventure at that time).
*The Indiana Jones Adventure is represented by the evil Eye of Mara, guarded by snakes.
*The 50th Anniversary of Disneyland is represented by fireworks and Tinker Bell.
The castle and park decor were primarily gold, in a nod to a traditional fiftieth anniversary. Gold accents were added to the castle, including gold railings along the front turrets which doubled as fall protection. This railing was removed during the refurbishment leading to the 60th Anniversary and replaced with a retractable railing.

===The Diamond Celebration (2015)===
For Disneyland&#x27;s 60th anniversary, the castle was covered with diamonds and glitter, with a large 60th medallion above the entryway. The castle design and overall decor were primarily diamond-themed, in a nod to a traditional sixtieth anniversary. Most of the decoration was removed shortly after the celebration, although the decorative faux roofs remained until January 2018, as the original roofs underneath the decorations were damaged during the celebration.

===100 Years Of Wonder (2023)===
The castle was decorated for Disney&#x27;s 100th Anniversary celebration, this time with iridescence and silver, complete with a giant 100th medallion above the entryway. Fountains were also installed in the moat in front of the castle. By October 14, 2023, most of the decorations were removed, while the last large one, the 100th medallion, was removed on November 10th, 2023. The fountains are the only thing remaining as of January 2025. 

===The Disneyland Resort 70th Anniversary (2025)===
In honor of the 70th anniversary, the castle will be decorated in blue, pink, and yellow ribbons, with faux glittery roofs/toppers and a 70th Anniversary medallion located in the center. 

== Disneyland Park (Paris) ==


Sleeping Beauty Castle (English for Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant) is at the centre of Disneyland Park and a continuation of Sleeping Beauty Castle first seen at Disneyland in California.

The Castle features two parts, a dungeon area in the base featuring an Audio-Animatronic dragon and, above, a concrete balcony walkthrough area with Sleeping Beauty–themed stained glass windows and tapestries. There are also several shops selling glass figures, ornaments and gifts.
The castle has received several overlays throughout the years. The first occurred during the park&#x27;s first anniversary celebration in 1993, when the castle was dressed up as a cake complete with strawberries, icing and candles. This overlay was removed after the celebration ended. The cake overlay concept was later copied by Walt Disney World&#x27;s Cinderella Castle in 1996 for the 25th Anniversary of the resort.

During the fifth anniversary of Disneyland Paris in 1997, the castle was decorated in carnival masks, jester hats, frills and bells to promote the animated film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. This overlay lasted until the beginning of 1998.

During the tenth anniversary of Disneyland Paris in 2002, the front of the castle was fitted with a golden scroll displaying a large 10. The scroll and other anniversary material in the park were removed in 2003.

In 2007, the castle received another overlay, celebrating the park&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary. It featured golden Disney characters displayed on the turrets and spires, each holding a candle, and Tinkerbell on the highest spire. The candles were illuminated each night during a special &#x27;Candlebration&#x27; ceremony which took place on a raised temporary stage at Central Plaza, in front of the Castle. A huge illuminated gold plaque featuring a large &#x27;15&#x27; was hung on the front of the castle. This echoed the overlay from the tenth anniversary in 2002. The fifteenth anniversary and the &#x27;Candlebration&#x27; ceremony ended on March 7, 2009.

The fifteenth anniversary overlay quickly followed on April 4, 2009 by Mickey&#x27;s Magical Party, a &quot;theme year&quot; celebration held at the park. The castle was again overlaid, this time with a Mickey and Friends plaque over the main window, and the spire heads were changed from being characters to being 3 circles &quot;of ribbon&quot; representing Mickey Mouse. A more permanent Central Plaza stage was built outside the castle to host the &quot;It&#x27;s dance time... with Mickey and Friends&quot; show.

The castle was repainted in a new colour-scheme, restored and fitted with multicolored LED lighting in 2011 and again for 2021. For any modern nighttime spectacular shows, its moat was fitted with water fountains, the upper window was replaced by doors that open to reveal a LED lighted star and Central Plaza stage was removed in order to increase the viewing area.

==Hong Kong Disneyland==

Hong Kong&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle was a nearly identical copy of the original in California. However, the two castles were differentiated through very subtle details. Hong Kong Disneyland used a different color scheme compared to that of Disneyland, with more natural white and pink colours for the accents and cornice. It also had fewer trees surrounding its castle, which allowed a more open view to accompany the nightly fireworks show.

The castle closed on January 1, 2018 for a redesign as part of the park&#x27;s 15th anniversary celebration. This redesign is meant to pay tribute to 14 Disney princesses and heroines. It has been renamed Castle of Magical Dreams.

===5th Anniversary===
In celebration of Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s fifth anniversary, Celebration in the Air, the castle was transformed into Tinker Bell&#x27;s Pixie Dusted Castle. The castle was decorated with golden pixie dust, which sparkled and shimmered in the sun and was illuminated by night.

===10th Anniversary===
Although no significant decorations were added to Hong Kong Disneyland&#x27;s Sleeping Beauty Castle for the park&#x27;s 10th anniversary, the nightly &quot;Disney In The Stars&quot; fireworks show was added with elaborate projection mapping with visuals to complement the display. This, however, resulted in the elimination of a few pyrotechnic elements launched from the front of the castle during the show.

==Logo usage==

As Sleeping Beauty Castle is a Disney icon, it was used in the opening of the Walt Disney anthology television series from the show&#x27;s beginning in 1954 until the late 70s, when it was replaced by the Cinderella Castle. It was also the logo of Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television, Disney Music Group and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures from 1985–2006. As of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; in 2006, the logo is now 3D CGI and includes elements of both this castle and Cinderella Castle.

<doc id="1299443" wikidata="Q62460" url="?curid=1299443" title="Far Rockaway">
<text>Far Rockaway is a neighborhood on the eastern part of the Rockaway peninsula in the New York City borough of Queens. It is the easternmost section of the Rockaways. The neighborhood extends from Beach 32nd Street east to the Nassau County line. Its southern boundary is the Atlantic Ocean; it is one of the neighborhoods along Rockaway Beach.

Far Rockaway is located in Queens Community District 14 and its ZIP Codes are 11691 and 11693. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 101st Precinct.

==History==
=== Precolonial and colonial era ===
The indigenous inhabitants of the Rockaways were the Canarsie Indians, a band of Mohegan, whose name was associated with the geography. By 1639, the Mohegan tribe sold most of the Rockaways to the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, the English defeated the Dutch colony and took over their lands in present-day New York. In 1685, the band chief, &quot;Tackapoucha&quot;, and the English governor of the province agreed to sell the Rockaways to a Captain Palmer for 31 pounds sterling.

The Rockaway Peninsula was originally designated as part of the Town of Hempstead, then a part of Queens County. Palmer and the Town of Hempstead disputed over who owned Rockaway, so in 1687 he sold the land to Richard Cornell, an iron master from Flushing. Cornell and his family lived on a homestead on what is now Central Avenue, near the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. At his death, Cornell was buried in a small family cemetery, Cornell Cemetery.

=== 19th century ===
In the late 19th century, the Rockaway Association wanted to build a hotel on the Rockaway Peninsula, as it was increasingly popular as a summer destination. The association, consisting of many wealthy members who had homes in the area, bought most of Cornell&#x27;s old homestead property. They developed the Marine Pavilion on that site, which attracted such guests as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Washington Irving, and the Vanderbilt family. The Rockaway Association also built the Rockaway Turnpike. The Marine Hotel burned to the ground in 1864, but more hotels and private residences were built in the area.

In the 19th century, people traveled to the Rockaways by horse-drawn carriages or on horseback. A ferry powered by steam sailed from Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn. By the 1880s, the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Rockaway Beach Branch was built to serve Far Rockaway station. The steam railroad went to Long Island City and Flatbush Terminal (now Atlantic Terminal). When it opened in the 1880s, this connection stimulated population growth on the Rockaway Peninsula. Benjamin Mott gave the LIRR of land for a railroad depot. Land values increased and businesses in the area grew, and by 1888, Far Rockaway was a relatively large village. It incorporated as a village on September 19 of that year.

=== 20th century to present ===

In 1898, the area was incorporated into the City of Greater New York and became part of Queens. The neighborhoods of Far Rockaway, Hammels, and Arverne in Queens tried to secede from the city several times. In 1915 and 1917, a bill approving secession passed in the legislature but was vetoed by the New York City mayor John Purroy Mitchel. The area saw economic decline in World War I and again during the Great Depression. New apartment complexes were built in the neighborhood following World War II, but the construction of public housing and medical institutions again caused the reputation of Far Rockaway to decline in the 1960s.

In September 2017, the New York City Council voted to rezone 23 blocks in the center of Far Rockaway, after the New York City Planning Commission approved the rezoning. The rezoning would allow as many as 3,100 residences to be built in the neighborhood, as well as community spaces and retail. Following the rezoning, city officials approved 670 affordable apartments within the area in 2018.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Far Rockaway was 50,058, a change of 1,714 (3.4%) from the 48,344 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 25.5% (12,778) White, 44.7% (22,400) African American, 0.3% (175) Native American, 1.9% (931) Asian, 0.1% (44) Pacific Islander, 1% (504) from other races, and 1.7% (860) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 24.7% (12,366) of the population.

==Points of interest==
===Bungalows===

The Far Rockaway Beach Bungalow Historic District recognizes an area with a distinct character. This and individual properties, such as the Russell Sage Memorial Church, Trinity Chapel, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

With its nearby beach, Far Rockaway attracted tourists and vacationers from the other boroughs. Bungalows were the homes of choice for many residents who lived in Far Rockaway. The railroad abandoned the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1950 because of the shift of many people to driving private cars. In addition, this destination had to compete with the many others that people were visiting by car and air travel, which created access to even more distant destinations and heightened competition for travel dollars.

As the neighborhood&#x27;s heyday as a resort community declined in the 1950s, the city built substantial numbers of public housing developments to try to replace substandard housing after World War II. Bungalows and other residential housing were converted to year-round use for low-income residents. Some bungalows were used as public housing. The 1970s New York City budget crisis had a negative effect on the provision of social services, and problems of poverty, unemployment and drug use increased in this area.

In September 1984, residents founded the Beachside Bungalow Preservation Association to &quot;improve the quality of the Far Rockaway community through preservation, education, and cultural programs&quot;. The organization donated a collection of materials highlighting its history, correspondence, and activities to the Queens Library Archives in 2008.

==Police and crime==
Far Rockaway is patrolled by the NYPD&#x27;s 101st Precinct, located at 16-12 Mott Avenue. The 101st Precinct and the adjoining 100th Precinct, which serves the rest of the Rockaways, collectively ranked 10th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. However, the low-income and densely populated 101st Precinct has significantly more crime than the 100th Precinct, which is high-income and more insular.

The 101st Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 74.6% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 6 murders, 26 rapes, 151 robberies, 301 felony assaults, 98 burglaries, 250 grand larcenies, and 31 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

== Fire safety ==
Far Rockaway is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Cos. 264 and 328/Ladder Co. 134, located at 16-15 Central Avenue.

== Post office and ZIP Code ==
Far Rockaway is covered by ZIP Code 11691. The United States Post Office operates the Far Rockaway Station at 18-36 Mott Avenue.

==Education==

===Schools===

====Public schools====
The neighborhood, like all of New York City, is served by the New York City Department of Education. Far Rockaway residents are zoned to several different elementary schools:
* P.S. 43
* P.S. 104 (The Bayswater School) (Kindergarten–6th grade)
* P.S. 105 (The Bay School)
* P.S. 106
* P.S. 197 (The Ocean School)
* P.S. 215 (W.A.V.E Prep)
* P.S. 253

Far Rockaway residents are zoned to M.S. 53 Brian Piccolo.

All New York City residents who wish to attend a public high school must apply to high schools. Far Rockaway High School was located in Far Rockaway, but was shut down in 2011 as a stand-alone institution. During the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2011, many large, underperforming, older traditional high schools were closed in the city. The 1929 building was renovated to operate as the Far Rockaway Educational Campus, home to a number of smaller, specialized academies that share the building. They can provide more individualized attention to their students. The former Beach Channel High School was similarly closed in 2014 and repurposed to house several smaller, specialized academies; it is in Rockaway Park, near Far Rockaway, and draws some of its students from Far Rockaway.

===Library===
Queens Public Library operates the Far Rockaway branch at 1637 Central Avenue. The library replaced another one that was also located on Central Avenue. In 2013, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that the city planned to construct a public library in the neighborhood, to be designed by the internationally known architectural firm Snøhetta. Construction started in November 2018, and the new library opened in July 2024 at a cost of $39 million. The current building is across two stories, with a glass facade and a blue roof that collects rainwater. The building&#x27;s facade includes the artwork &quot;Style Writing&quot; by José Parlá, while the second floor has the artwork &quot;Feynman Code&quot; by Pablo Helguera.

===Jewish institutions===
During the early and mid-20th century, many Jewish immigrants and their working-class descendants settled in Far Rockaway, sometimes first as summer visitors. They founded numerous synagogues and private schools, including those devoted to all-boys or all-girls institutions for educating Orthodox children. Following World War II, as residential housing was developed in Nassau and later Suffolk counties, many Jewish families left the Rockaways for newer housing. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Far Rockaway had &quot;flourished in the 1940s but withered...1960s&quot; until &quot;a few Jewish families...started the Hebrew Free Loan Society for new home buyers.&quot;

Synagogues include Congregation Kneseth Israel in Far Rockaway (The White Shul), which was founded in 1922. Schools include Sh&#x27;or Yoshuv Institute of Jewish Studies/Sh&#x27;or Yoshuv Yeshiva, Yeshiva Darchei Torah and the Yeshiva of Far Rockaway.

==Transportation==

Far Rockaway is served by the following transportation services:
* The New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Rockaway Line (), which has a terminal at Mott Avenue.
* The Far Rockaway terminal station for the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Far Rockaway Branch. The branch had been part of a loop with service along the existing route, continuing through the Rockaway Peninsula and crossing on a trestle across Jamaica Bay through Queens, where it reconnected with other branches. Frequent fires and maintenance problems led the LIRR to abandon the Queens portion of the route. The city acquired this to develop the IND Rockaway Line.
* MTA Regional Bus Operations: 
* Nassau Inter-County Express: . Unlike other NICE routes in Queens, these buses operate open-door in Far Rockaway, meaning customers can ride these buses wholly within the neighborhood without going to Nassau County.

<doc id="1299450" wikidata="Q7799336" url="?curid=1299450" title="Thurman Arnold">
<text>Thurman Wesley Arnold (June 2, 1891 – November 7, 1969) was an American lawyer best known for his trust-busting campaign as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division in President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Department of Justice from 1938 to 1943. He later served as a Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Before coming to Washington in 1938, Arnold was the mayor of Laramie, Wyoming and a professor at Yale Law School, where he took part in the legal realism movement and published two books: &quot;The Symbols of Government&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Folklore of Capitalism&quot; (1937). He also published &quot;The Bottlenecks of Business&quot; (1940).

==Early life and education==

Thurman was born in the frontier ranch town of Laramie, Wyoming, which grew to be a small city and the location of the University of Wyoming. He was the son of Annie (Brockway) and Constantine Peter Arnold. He began his university studies at Wabash College, but transferred to Princeton University, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1911. He earned his Bachelor of Laws from Harvard Law School in 1914.

==Early career==

Arnold served in World War I, rising to the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army (Field Artillery) and worked briefly in Chicago, Illinois before returning to Laramie, where he was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives in 1921 and then mayor from 1923 to 1924. He developed a reputation as a maverick lawyer. He was a Lecturer at the University of Wyoming from 1921 to 1926. He was Dean of the West Virginia University College of Law from 1927 to 1930. He was a visiting professor at Yale University from 1930 to 1931, and then professor of law at the same institution from 1931 to 1938. 

==Federal government==
Arnold was a special assistant to the general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in 1933. He was an Assistant Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice from 1938 to 1943. As chief competition lawyer for the United States Government, Arnold launched numerous studies to support the antitrust efforts in the late 1930s. He targeted the American Medical Association in their anti-competitive efforts against health plans. The Roosevelt administration later de-emphasized antitrust enforcement, for the stated purpose of allowing corporations to concentrate on contributing to victory in World War II.

==Federal judicial service==

Arnold was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 11, 1943, to an Associate Justice seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) vacated by Associate Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge. He was &quot;kicked upstairs&quot; by President Roosevelt to the Court of Appeals to get him out of the Antitrust Division. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 9, 1943, and received his commission on March 11, 1943. His service terminated on July 9, 1945, due to his resignation.

===Court of Appeals tenure===

Although the District of Columbia Court of Appeals had some responsibility for review of decisions by federal administrative agencies, during Arnold&#x27;s tenure the court&#x27;s primary role was reviewing decisions of local trial courts involving routine civil and criminal matters arising in Washington, D.C. Arnold was never happy during his time on the court, resigning after only two years on the bench. As an explanation of his decision, he told observers he &quot;would rather be speaking to damn fools than listening to damn fools.&quot; 

==Arnold &amp; Porter==

Arnold returned to private practice in Washington, D.C., where, along with Paul A. Porter and Abe Fortas, he co-founded the law firm known today as Arnold &amp; Porter.

== Personal and death ==

Thurman married his lifelong partner Frances Longan Arnold on September 4, 1917. They had two children, Thurman Jr. and George, both of whom enjoyed successful careers in the law. Nebraskan &quot;Hugh Cox, famous as Thurman Arnold&#x27;s chief deputy&quot; and also as an early partner at Root Clark &amp; Bird (later Root, Clark, Buckner &amp; Ballantine; later Dewey Ballantine, later Dewey &amp; LeBouef) was attorney for Donald Hiss, brother of Alger Hiss. Both Cox and Hiss were partners at Covington &amp; Burling, where he was called the &quot;perfect advocate&quot;) during the Hiss-Chambers Case.&quot;

Arnold died on November 7, 1969.

Thurman Arnold Jr. established a law firm in Palm Springs, California in 1953. Thurman Arnold Jr.&#x27;s son, Thurman Arnold III, joined his father&#x27;s law firm in 1982 and is currently practicing law with an emphasis on Family Law in Palm Springs, California. George Arnold married and raised a family with Ellen Cameron Pearson, daughter of columnist Drew Pearson and granddaughter of Cissy Patterson, owner of the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;.

<text>The Leme panoramic camera was invented by Sebastião Carvalho Leme (1918–2007), a photographer from Marília, São Paulo, Brazil.

In 1957, an entrepreneur requested a picture of his buildings, which stood at three of the corners of a street-crossing, and he wanted to show the group of buildings in one single photo, which would have to cover 360°. Using a Rolleiflex with a panoramic head, ten negatives were taken that, enlarged and mounted, resulted in a 360° photo. Leme then addressed the challenge of taking a 360° photo in a single negative.

The demonstration of his eventual solution consisted of a lens mounted in a small, empty tomato purée can, an internal device which is the principle of the invention, and a piece of film fixed inside the can. He tested it in front of the Senai building by rotating the lens by hand. The film, when developed, precariously confirmed that it was possible to take 360° photos. 

The first prototype was entirely mechanical. Three prototypes were made, and they were improved over one year. In the meantime, sure of having found a solution to the problem of taking 360° photos, Leme applied for a patent registration, a process that went on for some years.

On April 23, 1962 the patent was awarded under No. 61.472. About 20 years after the patent was awarded, a similar system appeared in the United States, but without the internal device mentioned above. The camera remained out of use for 15 years. At the end of 1997, it was taken up again, improved, and put to use once more.

<text>Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, doing business as Arnold &amp; Porter, is an American multinational law firm. It is a white-shoe firm and among the largest law firms in the world, both by revenue and by number of lawyers.

==History==
The original firm was founded as Arnold &amp; Fortas in 1946 by New Deal veterans Thurman Arnold, a former Yale Law School professor and U.S. Court of Appeals judge on the D.C. Circuit, and Abe Fortas, another former Yale Law School professor who later became a Supreme Court Justice. In 1947, Paul A. Porter, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, joined the firm and it was renamed as Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter. In 1965, Abe Fortas&#x27; name was dropped from the firm&#x27;s moniker after his ascension to the Supreme Court.

In November 2016, Arnold &amp; Porter announced that it would be merging with New York-based firm Kaye Scholer (founded in 1917) to form Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, with approximately 1,000 attorneys across ten domestic and four international offices. The merger took effect on January 1, 2017.

In February 2018, &quot;The National Law Journal&quot; reported that the newly combined &quot;firm has quietly reversed its post-merger branding efforts&quot; and &quot;scrubbed nearly all mention of &#x27;Kaye Scholer&#x27; from its public image, changing its brand name, email addresses and web domain&quot;, while retaining the legal entity name in full. In September 2020, Arnold &amp; Porter announced that it will shut down its Frankfurt office by the end of March 2021.

In 2022, Arnold &amp; Porter was a founding member of the Legal Alliance for Reproductive Rights, a coalition of United States law firms offering free legal services to people seeking and providing abortions in the wake of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overruled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

In 2020, Arnold &amp; Porter attorneys helped secure a $14 million judgment for 12 Black Lives Matter protesters who were victims of police brutality in Colorado. The matter took 18 months to settle and required 14,000-plus lawyer hours.

Attorneys with the firm assisted the family of Lt. Henry Ossian Flipper in obtaining the first posthumous presidential pardon in U.S. history, and represented Ukrainian mail order bride Nataliya Fox against international marriage broker Encounters International in a landmark case that helped to establish the rights of such women.

The firm is co-counsel with the DC Prisoners&#x27; Project of the Washington Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, which represents prisoners at ADX Florence who allege deficiencies in psychiatric evaluation and care in &quot;Cunningham v. Federal Bureau of Prisons&quot;.

<text>Reginar IV, Count of Mons, in Hainaut, (c. 950–1013) was the son of Reginar III and Adela. His father died in exile in Bohemia in 973.

==History==
His father, Reginar III, was exiled in 958 as a rebel by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. Hainaut was held after then by Godfrey I, Duke of Lower Lorraine, but Reginar IV claimed that Mons in Hainaut had been his father&#x27;s.

He attacked Mons in 973, after the death of Duke Godfrey, but did not manage to hold it, because Godfrey I, Count of Verdun then held it until he died. He managed to replace Godfrey as Count of Mons in 998.

==Family==
Regnier IV married Hedwig, daughter of Hugh Capet and Adelaide of Poitou.

They had:

* Reginar V, Count of Mons, married Mathilde of Verdun, daughter of Herman, Count of Verdun.
* Lambert of Mons
* Beatrix, who married Ebles I, Count of Rheims and Roucy and Archbishop of Rheims.
* Ermentrude, died at the age of two or three; buried in the Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude in Nivelles, Belgium. The burial came to light during an excavation. A lead cross, inscribed with her name and that of her parents, was found in the tomb.

<text>The Andantes were an American female session group for the Motown record label during the 1960s. Composed of Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps, the group sang background vocals on numerous Motown recordings, including songs by Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, the Four Tops, Jimmy Ruffin, Edwin Starr, the Supremes, the Marvelettes, Marvin Gaye and the Isley Brothers, among others. It is estimated they appeared on 20,000 recordings. 

The Andantes provided back-up singing on Motown singles starting in 1962. The group was most prominently used on all of the Four Tops&#x27; Holland–Dozier–Holland-produced hits, including &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)&quot;, &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, and more. Motown began to use the Andantes as either substitute or additional background vocalists on certain recordings by its girl groups beginning with the Marvelettes recordings in 1965, Martha &amp; the Vandellas in 1966, and major part of the Supremes recordings between 1968–1969 although Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong continued to record. 

In 1963, the Andantes, with the Marvelettes, released the single &quot;Too Hurt to Cry, Too Much in Love to Say Goodbye&quot; b/w &quot;Come on Home&quot; as credited to &quot;the Darnells&quot;. In 1964 they released a single of their own called &quot;(Like A) Nightmare&quot; b/w &quot;If You Were Mine&quot;, though none of the actual Andantes sang lead on either track (future Marvelette Ann Bogan performed the lead vocals).

The Andantes are also featured on some records that were not produced by Motown Records, the most prominent example being Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; (Pat Lewis substitutes for Louvain Demps on this track). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, The Andantes were signed to Motorcity Records, recording songs on their own, as well as once again serving as backing vocalists to fellow former Motown artists. During this time, Lewis had joined the group as a full-time member.

In addition to various awards, the Andantes were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in August 2014.

Marlene Barrow died on February 23, 2015, at the age of 73. Pat Lewis died on September 2, 2024, at the age of 76.

<doc id="1299530" wikidata="Q883628" url="?curid=1299530" title="Saint Lucy's Day">
<text>Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, also called the Feast of Saint Lucy, is a Christian feast day observed on 13 December. The observance commemorates Lucia of Syracuse, an early-fourth-century virgin martyr under the Diocletianic Persecution. According to legend, she brought food and aid to Christians hiding in the Roman catacombs, wearing a candle-lit wreath on her head to light her way, leaving both hands free to carry as much food as possible. Because her name means &quot;light&quot; and her feast day had at one time coincided with the shortest day of the year prior to calendar reforms, it is now widely celebrated as a festival of light. Falling within the Advent season, Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day is viewed as a precursor of Christmastide, pointing to the arrival of the Light of Christ in the calendar on 25 December, Christmas Day.

Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day is celebrated most widely in Scandinavia, Italy, and the island nation of Saint Lucia, each emphasising a different aspect of her story. In Scandinavia, where Lucy is called Santa/Sankta Lucia, she is represented as a woman in a white dress symbolizing a baptismal robe and a red sash symbolizing the blood of her martyrdom, with a crown or wreath of candles on her head.

In Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, as songs are sung, girls dressed as Saint Lucy carry cookies and saffron buns in procession, which symbolizes bringing the Light of Christ into the world&#x27;s darkness. In both Catholic and Protestant churches, boys participate in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmastide, such as that of Saint Stephen or generic gingerbread men, Santa Clauses, or nisses. The celebration of Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day is said to help one live the winter days with enough light.

A special devotion to Saint Lucy is practised in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige (in Northern Italy), and Sicily (in Southern Italy), as well as in the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. In Hungary and Croatia, a popular tradition on Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day involves planting wheat grains that grow to be several centimetres tall by Christmas Day, representing the Nativity of Jesus.

Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day is followed by the Ember Days.

== Origins ==
An inscription in Syracuse dedicated to Euskia mentioning St. Lucy&#x27;s Day as a local feast dates back to the fourth century A.D., which states &quot;Euskia, the irreproachable, lived a good and pure life for about 25 years, died on my Saint Lucy&#x27;s feast day, she for whom I cannot find appropriate words of praise: she was a Christian, faithful, perfection itself, full of thankfulness and gratitude&quot;. The Feast of Saint Lucy became a universal feast of the Church in the 6th century, commemorating the Christian martyr&#x27;s death on 13 December 304 A.D. St. Lucy&#x27;s day appears in the sacramentary of Gregory, as well as that of Bede, and Christian churches were dedicated to Saint Lucy in Italy as well as in England.

Later, Christian missionaries arrived in Scandinavia to evangelize the local population, carrying the commemoration of Saint Lucy with them, and this &quot;story of a young girl bringing light in the midst of darkness no doubt held great meaning for people who, in the midst of a North Sea December, were longing for the relief of warmth and light&quot;. Saint Lucy is one of very few saints still celebrated by the overwhelmingly Lutheran Nordic people Danes; Swedes; Finns and Norwegians but also in the United States and Canada and Italy. Some of the practices associated with the Feast of Saint Lucy may predate the adoption of Christianity in that region, and like much of Scandinavian folklore and even religiosity, is centred on the annual struggle between light and darkness. The Nordic observation of St. Lucy is first attested in the Middle Ages, and continued after the Protestant Reformation in the 1520s and 1530s, although the modern celebration is only about 200 years old. It is likely that tradition owes its popularity in the Nordic countries to the extreme change in daylight hours between the seasons in this region.

===13 December===

In Scandinavia (until as late as the mid 18th century) this date was the longest night of the year, coinciding with Winter Solstice, due to the Julian Calendar being employed at that time. The same can be seen in the poem &quot;&quot; by the English poet John Donne.

While this does not hold for the current Gregorian calendar, a discrepancy of eight days would have been the case in the Julian calendar during the 14th century, resulting in Winter solstice falling on 13 December. With the original adoption of the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century the discrepancy was ten days and had increased to 11 days in the 18th century when Scandinavia adopted the new calendar, with the Winter solstice falling on 21 December.

The Winter solstice is not visibly shorter than the several days leading up to and following it and although the actual Julian date of Winter solstice would have been on 15 or 14 December at the time when Christianity was introduced to Scandinavia, 13 December could well have lodged in people&#x27;s mind as being the shortest day.

The choice of 13 December as Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, however, predates the eight-day error of the 14th-century Julian calendar. This date is attested in the pre-Tridentic Monastic calendar, probably going back to the earliest attestations of her life in the sixth and seventh centuries, and it is the date used throughout Europe. So, while the world changed from a Julian to a Gregorian calendar system—and hence acquired a new date for the Winter Solstice—St Lucy&#x27;s Day was kept on 13 December, and not moved to the 21.

In the Roman Empire, 25 December (in the Julian Calendar) date was celebrated as being the day when the Sun was born, the birthday of Sol Invictus, as can be seen in the Chronography of 354. This date corresponds to the Winter solstice. Early Christians considered this a likely date for their saviour&#x27;s nativity, as it was commonly held that the world was created on Spring equinox (thought to fall on 25 March at the time), and that Christ had been conceived on that date, being born nine months later on Winter solstice.

A Swedish source states that the date of (Winter Solstice, St. Lucia, Lucinatta, Lucia-day, Lussi-mass...) i.e. 13 December, predates the Gregorian which implies that &quot;Lucia&#x27;s Day&quot; &quot;was&quot; 13 Dec in the Julian Calendar, &quot;which is equal to&quot; 21 December in the Gregorian, i.e. now. Same source states use of the name &quot;Little Yule&quot; for the day, that it was among the most important days of the year, that it marked the start of Christmas month, and that with the move to the Gregorian calendar (in Sweden 1753) the date (not the celebration) &quot;completely lost its appropriateness/significance&quot;.

=== Saint Lucy ===

According to the traditional story, Lucy was born of rich and noble parents in about the year 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but died when she was five years old, leaving Lucy and her mother without a protective guardian. Although no sources for her life story exist other than in hagiographies, St. Lucy, whose name &quot;Lucia&quot; refers to &quot;light&quot; (&quot;Lux, lucis&quot;), is known to have been a Sicilian saint who suffered a sad death in Siracusa, Sicily, around AD 310. A devout Christian who had taken a vow of virginity, her mother betrothed her to a pagan. She was seeking help for her mother&#x27;s long-term illness at the shrine of Saint Agatha when the saint appeared to her in a dream beside the shrine. Saint Agatha told Lucy that the illness would be cured through faith, and Lucy was able to convince her mother to cancel the wedding and donate the dowry to the poor. Enraged, her suitor then reported her to the governor for being a Christian. According to the legend, she was threatened to be taken to a brothel if she did not renounce her Christian beliefs, but they were unable to move her, even with a thousand men and fifty oxen pulling. Instead, they stacked materials for a fire around her and set light to it, but she would not stop speaking, insisting that her death would lessen the fear of it for other Christians and bring grief to non-believers. One of the soldiers stuck a spear through her throat to stop these denouncements, but to no effect. Another gouged out her eyes in an attempt to force her into complacency, but her eyes were miraculously restored. Saint Lucy was able to die only when she was given the Christian Last Rites.

In one story, Saint Lucy was working to help Christians hiding in the catacombs during the terror under the Roman Emperor Diocletian, and in order to bring with her as many supplies as possible, she needed to have both hands free. She solved this problem by attaching candles to a wreath on her head.

Saint Lucy is often depicted in art with a palm as the symbol of martyrdom.

=== Lussi ===
&quot;Lussinatta&quot;, the Lussi Night, was marked in Sweden 13 December. Then Lussi, a female being with evil traits, like a female demon or witch, was said to ride through the air with her followers, called &quot;Lussiferda&quot;. This itself might be an echo of the myth of the Wild Hunt, called &quot;Oskoreia&quot; in Scandinavia, found across Northern, Western and Central Europe.

Between Lussi Night and Yule, trolls and evil spirits, in some accounts also the spirits of the dead, were thought to be active outside. It was believed to be particularly dangerous to be out during Lussi Night. According to tradition, children who had done mischief had to take special care, since Lussi could come down through the chimney and take them away, and certain tasks of work in the preparation for Yule had to be finished, or else the Lussi would come to punish the household. The tradition of &quot;Lussevaka&quot; – to stay awake through the Lussinatt to guard oneself and the household against evil, has found a modern form through throwing parties until daybreak. Another company of spirits was said to come riding through the night around Yule itself, journeying through the air, over land and water.

There is little evidence that the legend itself derives from the folklore of northern Europe, but the similarities in the names (&quot;Lussi&quot; and &quot;Lucia&quot;), and the date of her festival, 13 December, suggest that two separate traditions may have been brought together in the modern-day celebrations in Scandinavia.

== Celebration ==
=== Italy ===
Catholic celebrations take place on 13 December and in May. Saint Lucy or Lucia, whose name comes from the Latin word &quot;lux&quot; meaning light, links with this element and with the days growing longer after the Winter solstice.

St. Lucy is the patron saint of the city of Siracusa, Sicily. On 13 December a silver statue of St. Lucy containing her relics is paraded from the Cathedral of Syracuse to the Basilica of Santa Lucia Outside the Walls, before returning on 20 December. Sicilians recall a legend that holds that a famine ended on her feast day when ships loaded with grain entered the harbour. Here, it is traditional to eat whole grains instead of bread on 13 December. This usually takes the form of &quot;cuccìa&quot;, a dish of boiled wheat berries often mixed with ricotta and honey, or sometimes served as a savoury soup with beans.

St. Lucy is also popular in some regions of North-Eastern Italy, namely Trentino, East Lombardy (Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona, Lodi and Mantua), parts of Veneto (Verona), parts of Emilia-Romagna (Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia and Bologna), and all of Friuli, where she is said to bring gifts to good children and coal to bad ones the night between 12 and 13 December. According to tradition, she arrives in the company of a donkey and her escort, Castaldo. Children are asked to leave some coffee for Lucia, a carrot for the donkey and a glass of wine for Castaldo. They must not watch Santa Lucia delivering these gifts, or she will throw ashes in their eyes, temporarily blinding them.

=== Croatia and Hungary ===
In Croatia, Hungary and some of their neighbouring countries, a popular tradition on Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day involves planting wheat grains; nowadays this serves as symbol of the new life born in Bethlehem, with a candle sometimes placed in the middle of the new plant as a symbol of the Light of Christ that Saint Lucia brings. Wheat grains are planted in a round dish or plate of soil, and then watered. If the planter is kept moist, the seeds germinate and the shoots are ideally several inches high by Christmas. The new green shoots, reminding us of the new life born in Bethlehem, may be tied with a ribbon and put near or under the Christmas tree. The real reason wheat was and is planted at this time, or on 4 December, the Day of Saint Barbara, is because the density, color and richness of the shoots will foretell how the upcoming yield will be, as well as increase the chances of it being a good one.
In Hungary, the Luca széke (Lucy&#x27;s chair) tradition teaches that one must start crafting a stool or chair on St. Lucy&#x27;s Day, doing one piece per day and finishing by Christmas Eve. On that night, when one stands on the finished stool or chair one will be able to see who is a witch.

=== Malta ===
Santa Luċija is the patron saint of the villages of Mtarfa (Malta) and Santa Luċija, Gozo. On 13 December Malta also celebrates Republic Day.

=== In the Nordic countries ===

The celebration of Lucia in its current format began in the 20th century and gained popularity in 1927 after a Stockholm newspaper sponsored a competition to select Lucia. The winner that year was a dark-haired girl, but over time, it became customary to choose a typical Swedish blonde.

On 13 December, Lucia is venerated in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland in a ceremony where a girl wearing a white gown with a red sash and a crown of candles walks at the head of a procession of women holding candles. The candles symbolize the fire that refused to take St. Lucy&#x27;s life when she was sentenced to be burned. The women sing a Lucia song to the melody of the traditional Neapolitan song &quot;Santa Lucia&quot;; the Neapolitan lyrics describe the view from Santa Lucia in Naples, the Scandinavian lyrics describe the light with which Lucia overcomes the darkness. Each Scandinavian country has lyrics in its native tongue. After finishing this song, procession Christmas carols or more songs about Lucia are sung.

==== Sweden ====


The Swedish lyrics to the Neapolitan song &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; have traditionally been either &quot;Natten går tunga fjät&quot; (&quot;The Night steps heavily&quot;) or &quot;Sankta Lucia, ljusklara hägring&quot; (&quot;Saint Lucy, bright mirage&quot;). There is also a modern version with simpler lyrics for children: &quot;Ute är mörkt och kallt (Outside, it&#x27;s dark and cold)&quot;.

Although St. Lucy&#x27;s Day is not an official holiday in Sweden, there is a widespread custom of schools choosing a girl to portray Lucy and a national competition is held among the regional winners. The regional Lucies visit shopping malls, old people&#x27;s homes and churches, singing and handing out gingernut cookies (&quot;pepparkakor&quot;). The procession in Ericsson Globe in Stockholm holds the Guinness World Records distinction of being the largest in the world, with 1200 participants from Adolf Fredrik&#x27;s Music School, Stockholms Musikgymnasium and Stockholmläns Blåsarsymfoniker.

Boys take part in the procession, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called &quot;stjärngossar&quot; (star boys); some may be dressed up as &quot;tomtenissar&quot; (Santa&#x27;s elves), carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as gingerbread men. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually &quot;Staffan Stalledräng&quot;, which tells the story about Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr, caring for his five horses.
Some trace the &quot;re-birth&quot; of the Lucy celebrations in Sweden to the tradition in German Protestant families of having girls dressed as angelic Christ children, handing out Christmas presents. The Swedish variant of this white-dressed &quot;Kindchen Jesus&quot;, or Christkind, was called &quot;Kinken Jes&quot;, and started to appear in upper-class families in the 18th century on Christmas Eve with a candle-wreath in her hair, handing out candy and cakes to the children. Another theory claims that the Lucy celebration evolved from old Swedish traditions of &quot;star boys&quot; and white-dressed angels singing Christmas carols at different events during Advent and Christmas. In either case, the current tradition of having a white-dressed woman with candles in her hair appearing on the morning of the Lucy Day started in the area around Vänern in the late 18th century and spread slowly to other parts of the country during the 19th century.

A special baked bun, &quot;Lussekatt&quot; (St. Lucy Bun), made with saffron and in use as early as November, is a very popular Christmas tradition.

Since 2008 there has been some controversy over males as Lucy, with one male who was elected Lucy at a high school being blocked from performing, and another performing together with a female. In another case a six-year-old boy was not allowed to appear with a Lucy crown because the school said it couldn&#x27;t guarantee his safety. Conflicts over children of color portraying Saint Lucy have also become prevalent, such as when a company posted an advertisement in 2016 where a dark-skinned Swedish child portrayed Saint Lucy.

====Finland====
The Finnish celebrations have been historically tied to Swedish culture and the Swedish-speaking Finns. They observe &quot;Luciadagen&quot; a week before the Winter Solstice. St Lucy is celebrated as a &quot;beacon of brightness&quot; in the darkest time of year. The first records of St. Lucy celebrations in Finland are from 1898, and the first large celebrations came in 1930, a couple of years after the popularization of the celebrations in Sweden. The St. Lucy of Finland has been elected since 1949 and she is crowned in the Helsinki Cathedral. Local St. Lucies are elected in almost every place where there is a Swedish populace in Finland. The Finnish-speaking population has also lately begun to embrace the celebrations.

In 2024, Daniela Owusu, a Finnish Ghanaian woman became Finland’s first Black Lucia, sparking racist abuse and tens of thousands of hate messages on social media.

==== Denmark ====

In Denmark, the Day of Lucy (&quot;Luciadag&quot;) was first celebrated on 13 December 1944. The tradition was directly imported from Sweden by initiative of Franz Wend, secretary of Föreningen Norden, as an attempt &quot;to bring light in a time of darkness&quot;. Implicitly it was meant as a passive protest against German occupation during the Second World War but it has been a tradition ever since.

Although the tradition is imported from Sweden, it differs somewhat in that the church celebration has always been strongly centered on Christianity and it is a yearly local event in most churches in conjunction with Christmas. Schools and kindergartens also use the occasion to mark the event as a special day for children on one of the final days before the Christmas holidays, but it does not have much impact anywhere else in society.

There are also a number of additional historical traditions connected with the celebration, which are not widely observed. The night before candles are lit and all electrical lights are turned off, and on the Sunday closest to 13 December Danes traditionally attend church.

The traditional Danish version of the Neapolitan song is not especially Christian in nature, the only Christian concept being &quot;Sankta Lucia&quot;. Excerpt: &quot;&quot;Nu bæres lyset frem | stolt på din krone. | Rundt om i hus og hjem | sangen skal tone.&quot; (&quot;The light&#x27;s carried forward | proudly on your crown. | Around in house and home | The song shall sound now.&quot;&quot;)

The Christian version used in churches is &quot;Sankta Lucia&quot; from 1982, by priest Holger Lissner.

Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day is celebrated also in the Faroe Islands.

==== Norway ====
Historically Norwegians considered what they called &quot;Lussinatten&quot; the longest night of the year and no work was to be done. From that night until Christmas, spirits, gnomes and trolls roamed the earth. Lussi, a feared enchantress, punished anyone who dared work. Legend also has it that farm animals talked to each other on Lussinatten, and that they were given additional feed on this longest night of the year. The &quot;Lussinatt&quot;, the night of 13 December, was largely forgotten in Norway at the beginning of the 20th century, though still remembered as an ominous night, and also celebrated in some areas, especially in Mid, Central and Eastern inland.

It was not until after World War II that the modern celebration of Lucia in Norway became adopted on a larger scale. It is now again observed all over the country.

Like the Swedish tradition, and unlike the Danish, Lucy is largely a secular event in Norway, and is observed in kindergartens and schools (often through secondary level).
However, it has in recent years also been incorporated in the Advent liturgy in the Church of Norway. The boys are often incorporated in the procession, staging as magi with tall hats and star-staffs. Occasionally, anthems of Saint Stephen are taken in on behalf of the boys.

For the traditional observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways of the school building carrying candles, and hand out &quot;lussekatt&quot; buns. While rarely observed at home, parents often take time off work to watch these school processions in the morning, and if their child should be chosen to be Lucia, it is considered a great honor. Later on in the day, the procession usually visits local retirement homes, hospitals, and nursing homes.

The traditional Norwegian version of the Neapolitan song is, just like the Danish, not especially Christian in nature, the only Christian concept being &quot;Sankta Lucia&quot;. Excerpt: &quot;Svart senker natten seg / i stall og stue. / Solen har gått sin vei / skyggene truer.&quot; (&quot;Darkly the night descends / in stable and cottage. / The sun has gone away / the shadows loom.&quot;)

==== Sámi ====
It has become common for those populations of Indigenous Sámi that live in districts where the Lucia Day is celebrated to also have such celebrations. While the Sámi &quot;Lucia beaivi&quot; events follow the mainly secular spirit of the Nordic majority cultures&#x27; Lucia celebrations, the lyrics to the Sámi version of the Neapolitan song are more markedly religious, focusing on the life story of Lucia the martyr. Excerpt: &quot;Guhkkin Sicilias / dolin lei nieida / Dan nieidda namma lei / Sáŋta Lucia.&quot; (&quot;In faraway Sicily / long ago was a girl / The name of that girl was / Saint Lucy.&quot;). The lyrics are also notable in that the words &quot;Sicilia&quot; and &quot;Lucia&quot; do not follow usual Sámi orthography, as when written like this they should be pronounced &quot;Sitsilia&quot; and &quot;Lutsia&quot; but are sung as &quot;Sisilia&quot; and &quot;Lusia&quot;.

=== Estonia ===
In Estonia Saint Lucia Day (&quot;Luutsinapäev&quot; in Estonian) was traditionally celebrated by the local Estonian Swedes. It is also celebrated annually in the Gustav Adolf Grammar School, which was founded by King Gustav II Adolf.

===Saint Lucia (Caribbean)===
In Saint Lucia, a small island nation in the Caribbean named after its patron saint, St. Lucy, 13 December is celebrated as National Day. The National Festival of Lights and Renewal is held the night before the holiday, in honour of St. Lucy of Syracuse the saint of light. In this celebration, decorative lights (mostly bearing a Christmas theme) are lit in the capital city of Castries; artisans present decorated lanterns for competition; and the official activities end with a fireworks display. In the past, a &quot;jour ouvert&quot; celebration has continued into the sunrise of 13 December.

===Spain===
The town of Mollerussa since 1963 holds a contest of paper clothing around this day. 
Saint Lucy is considered the patron saint of dressmakers, who showed their talent making elaborate dresses out of paper.

=== United States ===

The celebration of St. Lucy&#x27;s Day is popular among Scandinavian Americans, and is practiced in many different contexts, including (but not limited to) parties, at home, in churches, and through organizations across the country. Continuing to uphold this ritual helps people keep ties with the Scandinavian countries.

In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), which is the successor denomination to hundreds of Scandinavian and German Lutheran congregations, St. Lucy is treated as a commemoration on 13 December, in which red vestments are worn. Usually, the Sunday in Advent closest to 13 December is set aside for St. Lucy, in which the traditional Scandinavian procession is observed.

The public St. Lucy celebration in Lindsborg, Kansas, is a way to display the town&#x27;s Swedish heritage, and serves as a rallying point for the community. It also brings visitors to the town, which benefits the town financially.

Since 1979, Hutto, Texas, has held a St. Lucy celebration for their town at the Lutheran church. Every year a Lucy is picked from the congregation. The procession then walks around the church, sings the traditional St. Lucy song, and serves the traditional saffron buns and ginger cookies.

Gustavus Adolphus College, as a school founded by Swedish immigrants, has celebrated the Festival of Saint Lucy annually since 1941. Six sophomore women are chosen to be a part of the Court of St. Lucy. The women are chosen by their peers honoring the qualities of the legendary Lucy. In an effort to keep the tradition relevant to today, the selection process changed in 2011 was modified. First, the campus community is invited to submit nominations of any sophomore woman who exemplifies the qualities of courageous leadership, service to others, strength of character, and compassion and therefore is a light to others. These women do not have to have a Swedish connection or the ability to sing (since the court goes caroling in the early morning). Sophomore women then vote who should be on the court. The highest three nominees are included. Then the Guild of St. Lucy, a senior honors society, reviews the remaining nominations and selects up to three more women to serve on the court with the goal of having the court be representative of the sophomore class.

===Venezuela===
The town of Mucuchíes in Mérida state, Venezuela, has chosen as their patron saints St. Lucy and St. Benedict the Moor. Patron saint festivities are held during the month of December.

<text>The British Iron Age is a conventional name used in the archaeology of Great Britain, referring to the prehistoric and protohistoric phases of the Iron Age culture of the main island and the smaller islands, typically excluding prehistoric Ireland, which had an independent Iron Age culture of its own.
The Iron Age is not an archaeological horizon of common artefacts but is rather a locally-diverse cultural phase.

The British Iron Age followed the British Bronze Age and lasted in theory from the first significant use of iron for tools and weapons in Britain to the Romanisation of the southern half of the island. The Romanised culture is termed Roman Britain and is considered to supplant the British Iron Age.

The tribes living in Britain during this time are often popularly considered to be part of a broadly-Celtic culture, but in recent years, that has been disputed. At a minimum, &quot;Celtic&quot; is a linguistic term without an implication of a lasting cultural unity connecting Gaul with the British Isles throughout the Iron Age. The Brittonic languages, which were widely spoken in Britain at this time (as well as others including the Goidelic and Gaulish languages of neighbouring Ireland and Gaul, respectively), certainly belong to the group known as Celtic languages. However, it cannot be assumed that particular cultural features found in one Celtic-speaking culture can be extrapolated to the others.

==Etymology==
Claudius Ptolemy described Britain at the beginning of Roman rule but incorporated material from earlier sources. Although the name &quot;Pretanic Isles&quot; had been known since the voyage of Pytheas, and &quot;Britannia&quot; was in use by Strabo and Pliny, Ptolemy used the earlier &quot;Albion&quot;, which is known to have been used as early as the Massaliote Periplus.

==Periodisation==
At present over 100 large-scale excavations of Iron Age sites have taken place, dating from the 8th century BC to the 1st century AD and overlapping into the Bronze Age in the 8th century BC. Hundreds of radiocarbon dates have been acquired and have been calibrated on four different curves, the most precise being based on tree ring sequences.

The following scheme summarises a comparative chart presented in a 2005 book by Barry Cunliffe, but British artefacts were much later in adopting Continental styles such as the La Tène style of Celtic art: 

The Iron Age has been further subdivided with the &quot;Late Iron Age&quot; in Britain showing developments of new types of pottery, possibly influenced by Roman or Gaulish cultures. The clearing of forests for cultivation of agricultural crops intensified and areas with heavier and damper soil were settled. Spelt (&quot;Triticum spelta&quot;) was planted in these areas like the Tees Lowlands and some parts of Northern England.

The end of the Iron Age extends into the very early Roman Empire under the theory that Romanisation required some time to take effect. In parts of Britain that were not Romanised, such as Scotland, the period is extended a little longer, say to the 5th century. The geographer closest to AD 100 is perhaps Ptolemy. Pliny and Strabo are a bit older and therefore a bit more contemporary, but Ptolemy gives the most detail and the least theory.

==Archaeological evidence==


Attempts to understand the human behaviour of the period have traditionally focused on the geographic position of the islands and their landscape, along with the channels of influence coming from Continental Europe.

During the later Bronze Age, there are indications of new ideas influencing land use and settlement. Extensive field systems, now called Celtic fields, were being set out, and settlements were becoming more permanent and focused on better exploitation of the land. The central organisation to undertake that had been present since the Neolithic period but became targeted at economic and social goals, such as taming the landscape, rather than the building of large ceremonial structures like Stonehenge. Long ditches, some many miles in length, were dug with enclosures placed at their ends. Those are thought to indicate territorial borders and a desire to increase control over wide areas.

By the 8th century BC, there is increasing evidence of Great Britain becoming closely tied to Continental Europe, especially in Southern and Eastern Britain. New weapon types appeared with clear parallels to those on the Continent, such as the Carp&#x27;s tongue sword, complex examples of which are found all over Atlantic Europe. Phoenician traders probably began visiting Great Britain in search of minerals around this time and brought with them goods from the Mediterranean. At the same time, Northern European artefact types reached Eastern Great Britain in large quantities from across the North Sea.

Defensive structures dating from this time are often impressive such as the brochs of Northern Scotland and the hill forts that dotted the rest of the islands. Some of the most well-known hill forts include Maiden Castle, Dorset; Cadbury Castle, Somerset; and Danebury, Hampshire. Hill forts first appeared in Wessex in the Late Bronze Age but became common only in the period between 550 and 400 BC. The earliest were of a simple univallate form and often connected with earlier enclosures attached to the long ditch systems. Few hill forts have been substantially excavated in the modern era, Danebury being a notable exception, with 49% of its total surface area studied. However, it appears that the &quot;forts&quot; were also used for domestic purposes, with examples of food storage, industry and occupation being found within their earthworks. On the other hand, they may have been occupied only intermittently, as it is difficult to reconcile permanently-occupied hill forts with the lowland farmsteads and their roundhouses found during the 20th century, such as at Little Woodbury and Rispain Camp. Many hill forts are not in fact &quot;forts&quot; at all and demonstrate little or no evidence of occupation.

The development of hill forts may have occurred from greater tensions that arose between the better-structured and more populous social groups. Alternatively, there are suggestions that in the latter phases of the Iron Age, the structures simply indicate a greater accumulation of wealth and a higher standard of living although any such shift is invisible in the archaeological record for the Middle Iron Age, when hill forts come into their own. In that regard, they may have served as wider centres used for markets and social contact. Either way, during the Roman occupation the evidence suggests that as defensive structures, they proved to be of little use against concerted Roman attack. Suetonius comments that Vespasian captured more than 20 &quot;towns&quot; during a campaign in the West Country in 43 AD, and there is some evidence of violence from the hill forts of Hod Hill and Maiden Castle in Dorset from this period. Some hill forts continued as settlements for the newly-conquered Britons. Some were also reused by later cultures, such as the Saxons in the early medieval period.

==People of Iron Age Britain==


===Celtic movement from Continent===
The Roman historian Tacitus suggested that the Britons were descended from people who had arrived from the Continent, and he compared the Caledonians (in modern-day Scotland) to Germanic peoples, the Silures of Southern Wales to Iberian settlers and the inhabitants of Southeastern &quot;Britannia&quot; to Gaulish tribes. That migrationist view long informed later views of the origins of the British Iron Age and the making of the modern nations. Linguistic evidence inferred from the surviving Celtic languages in Northern and Western Great Britain at first appeared to support the idea, and the changes in material culture that archaeologists observed during later prehistory were routinely ascribed to a new wave of invaders.

From the early 20th century, the &quot;invasionist&quot; scenario was juxtaposed to a diffusionist view. By the 1960s, the latter model seemed to have gained mainstream support, but it in turn came under attack in the 1970s.

There was certainly a large migration of people from Central Europe westwards during the early Iron Age. The question whether these movements should be described as &quot;invasions&quot;, as &quot;migrations&quot; or as mostly &quot;diffusion&quot; is largely a semantic one.

Examples of events that could be labelled &quot;invasions&quot; include the arrival in Southern Britain of the Belgae from the end of the 2nd century BC, as described in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;. Such sudden events may be invisible in the archaeological record. In that case, it depends on the interpretation of Aylesford-Swarling pottery. Regardless of the &quot;invasionist&quot; vs. &quot;diffusionist&quot; debate, it is beyond dispute that exchanges with the Continent were a defining aspect of the British Iron Age. According to Caesar, the Britons further inland than the Belgae believed that they were indigenous.

===Demography===
The population of Britain increased significantly during the Iron Age probably to more than one million, partly due to improved barley and wheat and increased use of peas, beans and flax. Most were concentrated densely in the agricultural lands of the South. Settlement density and a land shortage may have contributed to rising tensions during the period. The average life expectancy at birth would have been around 25, but at the age of five, it would have been around 30. Those figures would be slightly lower for women, and slightly higher for men throughout the Middle Iron Age in most areas, on account of the high mortality rate of young women during childbirth; however, the average age for the two sexes would be roughly equal for the Late Iron Age. That interpretation depends on the view that warfare and social strife increased in the Late Iron Age, which seems to be fairly well attested in the archaeological record for Southern Britain at least.

Early in the Iron Age, the widespread Wessex pottery of Southern Britain, such as the type style from All Cannings Cross, may suggest a consolidated socio-economic group in the region. However, by 600 BC, that appears to have broken down into differing sub-groups with their own pottery styles. Between and 100 BC, there is evidence of emerging regional identities and a significant population increase.

==Iron Age beliefs in Britain==

The Romans described a variety of deities worshipped by the people of Northwestern Europe. Barry Cunliffe perceives a division between one group of gods relating to masculinity, the sky and individual tribes and a second group of goddesses relating to associations with fertility, the earth and a universality that transcended tribal differences. Wells and springs had female, divine links exemplified by the goddess Sulis worshipped at Bath. In Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Agricola&quot; (2.21), he notes the similarity between both religious and ritual practices of the pre-Roman British and the Gauls.

Religious practices often involved the ritual slaughter of animals or the deposition of metalwork, especially war booty. Weapons and horse trappings have been found in the bog at Llyn Cerrig Bach on Anglesey and are interpreted as votive offerings cast into a lake. Numerous weapons have also been recovered from rivers, especially the Thames but also the Trent and Tyne. Some buried hoards of jewellery are interpreted as gifts to the earth gods.

Disused grain storage pits and the ends of ditches have also produced what appear to be deliberately-placed deposits, including a preference for burials of horses, dogs and ravens. The bodies were often mutilated, and some human finds at the bottom of pits, such as those found at Danebury, may have had a ritual aspect.

Caesar&#x27;s texts state that the priests of Britain were Druids, a religious elite with considerable holy and secular powers. Great Britain appears to have been the seat of the Druidic religion, and Tacitus&#x27;s account of the later raid on Anglesey led by Suetonius Paulinus gives some indication of its nature. No archaeological evidence survives of Druidry, but a number of burials made with ritual trappings and found in Kent may suggest a religious character to the subjects.

Overall, the traditional view is that religion was practiced in natural settings in the open air. Gildas mentions &quot;those diabolical idols of my country, which almost surpassed in number those of Egypt, and of which we still see some mouldering away within or without the deserted temples, with stiff and deformed features as was customary&quot;. Sites such as at Hayling Island, in Hampshire, and the one found during construction work at Heathrow Airport are interpreted as purpose-built shrines. The Hayling Island example was a circular wooden building set within a rectangular precinct and was rebuilt in stone as a Romano-British temple in the 1st century AD to the same plan. The Heathrow temple was a small cella surrounded by a ring of postholes thought to have formed an ambulatory, which is very similar to Romano-Celtic temples found elsewhere in Europe. A rectangular structure at Danebury and a sequence of six-poster structures overlooking calf burials and culminating in a trench-founded rectangular structure at Cadbury Castle, Somerset, have been similarly interpreted. An example at Sigwells, overlooking Cadbury Castle, was associated with metalwork and whole and partial animal burials to its east. However, evidence of an open-air shrine was found at Hallaton, Leicestershire. Here, a collection of objects known as the Hallaton Treasure were buried in a ditch in the early 1st century AD. The only structural evidence was a wooden palisade built in the ditch.

Death in Iron Age Great Britain seems to have produced different behaviours in different regions. Cremation was a common method of disposing of the dead, but the chariot burials and other inhumations of the Arras culture of East Yorkshire and the cist burials of Cornwall demonstrate that it was not ubiquitous. In Dorset, the Durotriges seem to have had small inhumation cemeteries, sometimes with high status grave goods. In fact, the general dearth of excavated Iron Age burials makes drawing conclusions difficult. Excarnation has been suggested as a reason for the lack of burial evidence, with the remains of the dead being dispersed either naturally or through human agency.

==Economy of Iron Age Britain==
Trade links developed in the Bronze Age and beforehand provided Great Britain with numerous examples of continental craftsmanship. Swords especially were imported, copied and often improved upon by the natives. Early in the period, Hallstatt slashing swords and daggers were a significant import, but , the volume of goods arriving seems to have declined, possibly from more profitable trade centres appearing in the Mediterranean. La Tène culture items (usually associated with the Celts) appeared in later centuries, and again, they were adopted and adapted with alacrity by the locals.

There also appears to have been a collapse in the bronze trade during the early Iron Age, which can be viewed in three ways:

# Steady transition: the development of iron parallel to a diminishing bronze system.
# Rapid abandonment; iron undermines bronze and takes over its social function.
# Bronze crisis: severe reduction in the supply of bronze allows the iron to replace it.

With regard to animal husbandry, cattle represented a significant investment in pre-Roman Britain, as they could be used as a source of portable wealth and to provide useful domestic by-products such as milk, cheese and leather. In the later Iron Age, an apparent shift is visible, revealing a change in dominance from cattle rearing to that of sheep. Economically, sheep are significantly less labour-intensive, requiring fewer people per animal.

Cattle and sheep dominate the osteo-archaeological record, but evidence for pig, ox, dog and rarely chicken is widely represented. There is generally an absence from environmental remains of hunted game and wild species as well as fresh and sea water species, even in coastal communities.

A key commodity of the Iron Age was salt, used for preservation and the supplementation of diet. Though difficult to find archaeologically, some evidence exists. Salterns, in which sea water was boiled to produce salt, are prevalent in the East Anglia fenlands. Additionally, Morris notes that some salt trading networks spanned over 75 km.


Representing an important political and economic medium, the vast number of Iron Age coins found in Great Britain are of great archaeological value. Some, such as gold staters, were imported from Continental Europe. Others, such as the cast bronze (potin) coins of Southeast England, are clearly influenced by Roman originals. The British tribal kings also adopted the continental habit of putting their names on the coins they had minted, with such examples as Tasciovanus from Verulamium and Cunobelinos from Camulodunum identifying regional differentiation. Hoards of Iron Age coins include the Silsden Hoard in West Yorkshire found in 1998. A large collection of coins, known as the Hallaton Treasure, was found at a Late Iron Age shrine near Hallaton, Leicestershire, in 2000 and consisted of 5,294 coins, mostly attributed to the Corieltavi tribe. These were buried in 14 separate hoards over several decades in the early 1st century AD.

The expansion of the economy throughout the period, but especially in the later Iron Age, is in large part a reflection of key changes in the expression of social and economic status.

===Trade===
====Early and Middle Iron Age====
The Early Iron Age saw a substantial number of goods belonging to the Hallstatt culture imported from the continent, and they came to have a major effect on Middle Iron Age native art.

====Late Iron Age====

From the late 2nd century BC onwards, South-Central Britain was indirectly linked into Roman trading networks via Brittany and the Atlantic seaways to south-western Gaul. Hengistbury Head in Dorset was the most important trading site, and large quantities of Italian wine amphorae have been found there. These Atlantic trade networks were heavily disrupted following Julius Caesar&#x27;s failed conquest of Brittany in the 50s BC. This fact may support a supposition that the Celts of Britain had an economic interest in supporting their Gallic brethren in their resistance to Roman occupation.

In South-eastern Britain, meanwhile, extensive contact with the &#x27;Belgic&#x27; tribes of northern Gaul is evidenced by large numbers of imported Gallo-Belgic gold coins between the mid-2nd century BC and Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul in the 50s BC. Those coins probably did not principally move through trade. In the past, the emigration of Belgic peoples to South-Eastern Britain has been cited as an explanation for their appearance in that region. However, recent work suggests that their presence there may have occurred from a kind of political and social patronage that was paid by the northern Gaulish groups in exchange for obtaining aid from their British counterparts in their warfare with the Romans on the Continent.

After Caesar&#x27;s conquest of Gaul, a thriving trade developed between South-Eastern Britain and the near Continent. That is archaeologically evidenced by imports of wine and olive oil amphorae and mass-produced Gallo-Belgic pottery. Strabo, writing in the early 1st century AD, lists ivory chains and necklaces, amber gems, glass vessels and other petty wares as articles imported to Britain, and he recorded the island&#x27;s exports as grain, cattle, gold, silver, iron, hides, slaves and hunting dogs. That trade probably thrived as a result of political links and client kingship relationships that developed between groups in South-Eastern Britain and the Roman world.

==End of Iron Age in Britain==
Historically speaking, the Iron Age in Southern Great Britain ended with the Roman invasion. Although the assimilation of Briton culture was far from instantaneous, some relatively-quick change is evident archaeologically. For example, the Romano-Celtic shrine in Hayling Island, Hampshire was constructed in the AD 60 to 70s, and Agricola was then still campaigning in Northern Britain (mostly in what is now Scotland), and on top of an Iron Age ritual site. Rectilinear stone structures, indicative of a change in housing to the Roman style are visible from the mid-to-late 1st century AD at Brixworth and Quinton.

In areas where Roman rule was not strong or non-existent, Iron Age beliefs and practices remained but not without at least marginal levels of Roman or Romano-British influence. The survival of place names, such as &quot;Camulodunum&quot; (Colchester), which derive from the native language, is evidence of that.

<doc id="1299545" wikidata="Q4892597" url="?curid=1299545" title="1983 Bermondsey by-election">
<text>A by-election was held in the [[Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey]] constituency in South London, on 24 February 1983, following the resignation of Labour MP Bob Mellish. Peter Tatchell stood as the candidate for the Labour Party, and Simon Hughes stood for the Liberal Party. Following a bitter campaign, the Liberals made huge gains and took the seat, with a majority of votes cast. Labour&#x27;s vote fell from 63.6 per cent in May 1979 to 26.1 per cent as Tatchell came a distant second, while the Conservative candidate, Robert Hughes, managed only fourth place, losing his deposit. With a swing of 44.2%, the 1983 Bermondsey by-election remains the largest by-election swing in British political history.

==Preliminaries==
Bob Mellish had represented the constituency and its predecessors in the House of Commons since 1946. He was the Labour Chief Whip from 1969 until 1976, but had become disenchanted with the left-wing drift of the Labour Party. He resigned from the party in August and his Parliamentary seat in November 1982, amid much acrimony within the party. He had been in dispute with his constituency party for several years and had earlier threatened to resign if Peter Tatchell was selected as the next prospective parliamentary candidate. He was recruited by the Conservative government to the board of the London Docklands Development Corporation; as he did not wish to be disqualified, the post was made non-salaried until such time as Mellish chose to accept payment. This meant that Mellish had a paid job to go to as soon as he wanted.
On 7 November 1981, Bermondsey Labour Party selected Peter Tatchell, its secretary, as prospective Parliamentary candidate. Tatchell was a leading member of the left-wing faction that had taken control of the local party the previous year. He was also a contributor to &quot;London Labour Briefing&quot;, a magazine that circulated among the London left, and had written an article suggesting the use of extra-Parliamentary direct action by the Labour Party, saying: &quot;We must look to new, more militant forms of extra-parliamentary opposition which involve mass popular participation and challenge the government&#x27;s right to rule&quot;. This call to civil disobedience was considered a call to violent action by some, and was used &quot;as a stick to beat [Tatchell] with&quot; by political opponents. For example, the article came to the attention of James Wellbeloved, a former London Labour MP who had defected to the Social Democratic Party; Wellbeloved then referred to it in a Parliamentary Question to Margaret Thatcher on 3 December.

Labour Party leader Michael Foot responded to Wellbeloved by denouncing Tatchell&#x27;s article and declared &quot;the individual concerned is not an endorsed member of the Labour Party and as far as I&#x27;m concerned never will be&quot;. Tony Benn wrote in his diary that many people, including himself, thought that Foot had confused Peter Tatchell with Peter Taaffe, then the leader of the Trotskyist Militant tendency, and Michael Crick in his book on Militant agrees that the fact that Tatchell and Taaffe have similar names contributed to public confusion between the two, despite the fact that Militant opposed Tatchell&#x27;s candidacy due to anti-gay feeling and political differences between the old left (Militant) and new left (Tatchell) of the party. As to whether Tatchell was a member of the Labour Party itself, Foot later clarified that he meant to say &quot;endorsed candidate&quot; instead of &quot;endorsed member&quot; in his response to Wellbeloved. At the next meeting of the Labour Party National Executive Committee, Tatchell was narrowly rejected as a candidate. Mellish was not reassured about the future direction of the Labour Party and resigned from it on 2 August 1982, a clear preliminary to resigning his seat, which he did by taking the Chiltern Hundreds on 1 November that year. The left wing of the Labour Party agreed Tatchell would be eligible for selection, and Tatchell was duly selected again in January 1983.

Tabloid newspapers had begun researching his background when Foot denounced him, in particular Tatchell&#x27;s activities with the Gay Liberation Front in the early 1970s. Several stories were published which made it clear that he was gay.

==Other candidates==

At the 1981 Greater London Council election, the Liberal Party had come second in Bermondsey. They chose their GLC candidate Simon Hughes, a barrister who had moved to the constituency earlier that year, to fight the by-election. The Conservatives chose Robert Hughes (no relation), who was a Greater London Council (GLC) councillor for Croydon Central. He later became the MP for Harrow West. Among those who applied for the Conservative nomination but were not chosen was Sara Keays, then having an as yet unrevealed affair with Cecil Parkinson.

The right-wing former Labour leader of Southwark Borough Council, John O&#x27;Grady, who had been a target for the left-wing faction locally, also decided to stand under the banner &#x27;Real Bermondsey Labour&#x27; with Bob Mellish&#x27;s support and encouragement. His campaign was dominated by personal opposition to Tatchell and defence of his leadership of the council. Twelve other candidates stood, including Screaming Lord Sutch, appearing for the first time under the Official Monster Raving Loony Party label, and the Dowager Lady Birdwood.

Esmond Bevan intended to stand as an independent Labour candidate, but erroneously entered his occupation in the section on the nomination papers headed &#x27;description&#x27;, thus appearing on ballot papers as &quot;Systems Designer&quot;.

==Start of the campaign==
The Labour campaign started disastrously when it was discovered that the first leaflets had been printed at Cambridge Heath Press, owned by the Militant tendency (then practising entryism in the Labour Party; a group whose five key members were expelled two days before polling day). The leaflets were all pulped and reprinted, but the cost of the first printing still counted against the limit for election spending.

==Attacks on Tatchell==
There was much controversy over Tatchell&#x27;s homosexuality. The Labour Party persuaded Tatchell to keep quiet about his sexual orientation, although he had previously declared himself &#x27;out&#x27;. Various campaigners for opposition candidates, as well as many within the Labour Party, made homophobic comments about Tatchell. Widespread graffiti throughout the constituency referred to him in derogatory terms, while some of those putting up posters in his support found their windows attacked. Tatchell received hate mail, including a live cartridge, and was attacked when out in the street.

Some of the other by-election candidates joined in: John O&#x27;Grady (Southwark Council leader, who was promoted as the &#x27;Real Bermondsey&#x27; Labour candidacy by the previous MP, Bob Mellish) was filmed touring the constituency on the back of a horse and cart, singing a song which referred to Tatchell &quot;wearing his trousers back to front&quot;. On the last weekend of the campaign, an anonymous leaflet was sent round the constituency headed &quot;Which Queen will you vote for?&quot;, contrasting the republican Tatchell, who was pictured looking very effeminate, with Queen Elizabeth II. The leaflet gave Tatchell&#x27;s home address and telephone number.

An alternative analysis of Tatchell&#x27;s eventual defeat was given by David Sutch, the Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidate, in his 1991 autobiography. When being interviewed on TV at the by-election count, Sutch related to Tatchell how horrified he was at the treatment Tatchell had received, but added that &quot;what I did not tell him was that he had been so bad a candidate that he had largely brought it on himself&quot;. Sutch criticised Tatchell&#x27;s preference for press conferences and press releases rather than traditional meeting-and-greeting, which was generally regarded as the best way to win hearts and minds at a by-election. In a later interview, when the subject of Bermondsey came up, Sutch said that Tatchell &quot;seemed to think all he needed to do to become the MP was turn up at the count&quot;.

===Homophobia, the Liberal campaign and Labour &quot;sabotage&quot;===
During the by-election, members of the Liberal Party were accused of having joined in homophobic attacks on Tatchell. Male Liberal canvassers were seen wearing badges reading &quot;I&#x27;ve been kissed by Peter Tatchell&quot;, although this seems to have been a poor taste joke by gay members of the Liberal Party.

While this was criticised by Roy Hattersley at a news conference, elements of the Labour party were also hostile to Tatchell on the grounds both of his politics and his sexuality. He would later recall: &quot;Subjected to 15 months of media smears, anti-gay violence and sabotage by the right of the party, I lost what had been a safe Labour seat.&quot;

In an interview with Simon Edge of &quot;The Independent&quot; published on 17 December 1996, the former Liberal Party Chief Executive, Andy Ellis, was asked whether he approved of the activity undertaken by the Liberal Gay Action Group, and replied &quot;Nothing went on in Bermondsey that we were unhappy with&quot;.

During his campaign for leadership of the Liberal Democrats in January 2006, Hughes said he &quot;had both homosexual and heterosexual relationships in the past&quot; and apologised for the actions of Liberals in the Bermondsey campaign, saying that while a lot of the blame for homophobic abuse laid on the press, &quot;I take responsibility&quot; for the actions of his organisers, adding: &quot;I have never been comfortable about the whole of that campaign, as Peter knows, and I said that to him in the past. ... Where there were things that were inappropriate or wrong, I apologise for that.&quot; Tatchell, by then a member of the Green Party, said that he had forgiven Hughes, saying &quot;Simon benefited from these dirty tricks, but that was 23 years ago—I don&#x27;t hold a grudge. It&#x27;s time to forgive and move on&quot;, adding that Hughes should be judged on his 23-year record as an MP.

==Opinion polls==
Bermondsey was one of the first by-elections to be extensively polled. The polls showed, at first, that the Labour vote was substantially down on the 1979 election figures, but that none of the rival candidates were particularly close. As the campaign went on, the Liberal candidate began to move into a clear second position and the other candidates faded. Later in the campaign, there were rumours which claimed that the right-wing of the Labour Party nationally wished to lose the seat, as it would prove that left-wing Labour candidates were unelectable. By the eve of poll, it was clear that large numbers of previously Labour voters were defecting to other parties, and that non-Labour voters were lining up in support of the Liberal candidate as the one most likely to beat Labour.

==Result and votes==
The Liberals made huge gains and took the seat, with a majority of votes cast. Labour&#x27;s vote fell from 63.6 per cent in May 1979 to 26.1 per cent as Tatchell came a distant second, while O&#x27;Grady took third. The Conservatives managed only fourth place, for the first time since the 1974 Newham South by-election, and the last in Britain until the 1991 Liverpool Walton by-election. All candidates other than Liberal and Labour lost their deposits.

Hughes would go on to represent Bermondsey and successor constituencies for the next 32 years, making him one of very few examples of MPs who took a formerly safe seat from another party and managed to hold it for a long period of time.

<text>Adolescents, also known as The Blue Album due to its cover design, is the debut studio album by American punk rock band the Adolescents, released in April 1981 on Frontier Records. Recorded after guitarist Rikk Agnew and drummer Casey Royer joined the band, it features several songs written for their prior group, the Detours, including &quot;Kids of the Black Hole&quot; and &quot;Amoeba&quot;, which became two of the Adolescents&#x27; most well-known songs. &quot;Adolescents&quot; was one of the first hardcore punk albums to be widely distributed throughout the United States, and became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums of its time. The band never toured in support of it, and broke up four months after its release. The &quot;Blue Album&quot; lineup of Agnew, Royer, guitarist Frank Agnew, bassist Steve Soto and singer Tony Brandenburg reunited several times in subsequent years, but only for brief periods.

==Background and recording==
The Adolescents formed in Fullerton, California, in January 1980. The original lineup consisted of singer Tony Brandenburg (who used the stage name Tony Cadena), bassist Steve Soto, guitarists Frank Agnew and John O&#x27;Donovan, and a drummer who went by the stage name Peter Pan. They began performing locally and recorded their first demo tape that March. A second demo tape, recorded that May, included the songs &quot;I Hate Children&quot;, &quot;No Friends&quot;, &quot;Who Is Who&quot; and &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. &quot;I Hate Children&quot; was inspired by a conversation Brandenburg overheard while riding a bus: &quot;It was a snapshot of a man saying to his wife — with his children there crying — that he hated children, can&#x27;t stand them&quot;, he said in 2011. &quot;And this was the same message that my father had given me. When I expressed that, people didn&#x27;t understand where that was coming from. I wasn&#x27;t saying this was me. I&#x27;m mirroring something that I&#x27;m seeing right now. This is what is going on in my life.&quot;

O&#x27;Donovan and Pan both left the band in June 1980. Frank Agnew&#x27;s older brother, Rikk Agnew, joined the group, initially on drums, but soon switched to guitar and brought in drummer Casey Royer. Royer and Rikk Agnew brought with them several songs written for their previous band, the Detours, including &quot;Amoeba&quot;, &quot;No Way&quot;, &quot;Creatures&quot;, &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, and &quot;Kids of the Black Hole&quot;. &quot;Kids of the Black Hole&quot; describes Social Distortion frontman Mike Ness&#x27; Fullerton apartment, a graffiti-covered drug den that was a hangout for punks and a site for parties, sex, and violence. &quot;To me, it is one of the greatest punk rock songs of all time&quot;, said Soto in 2014, &quot;and of course &#x27;Amoeba&#x27; was catchy as fuck, and everybody wants to hear it, but to me, &#x27;Kids of the Black Hole&#x27; was like &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; for us.&quot; Said his brother Frank, &quot;Rikk&#x27;s songwriting was really adventurous for punk rock. He was writing stuff that was punk but had a Beatles-esque quality with the guitar harmonies.&quot; He recalled, &quot;With the addition of Rikk and Casey, we&#x27;d moved to the next level&quot;. They were older and more experienced, so we improved quickly.&quot;

KROQ-FM disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer played the band&#x27;s second demo tape on his &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot; program showcasing local punk acts, giving them the encouragement to record another. They recorded a third demo that July with Chaz Ramirez and Eddie Joseph of local band Eddie and the Subtitles as audio engineers. This demo included &quot;Creatures&quot;, &quot;Amoeba&quot; and &quot;Self Destruct&quot;. Joseph became the band&#x27;s manager and began shopping their demo to local record labels. &quot;He even got us an advance check that he promptly cashed and left town...Thanks Eddie&quot;, Soto later recalled. The Adolescents continued performing locally and gained in popularity. Bingenheimer approached the band to record a track for his &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot; compilation album (Posh Boy Records, November 1980), which featured other Los Angeles and Orange County bands including Agent Orange, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks. The Adolescents provided a recording of &quot;Amoeba&quot;, which became a hit on KROQ that December and drew the attention of Frontier Records founder Lisa Fancher, who signed the band in January 1981. Amoeba&#x27; by the Adolescents is the song&quot;, she later said. &quot;Definitely was a phenomenon. &#x27;Amoeba&#x27; is a masterpiece of a single from any era of rock music.&quot;

In March 1981, the Adolescents entered Perspective Sound studios in Sun Valley, Los Angeles to record their debut album. Engineered and mixed by Thom Wilson and produced by Middle Class bassist Mike Patton (not to be confused for the Faith No More vocalist), it was recorded, mixed and mastered in only four days and featured most of the band&#x27;s oeuvre at the time, including songs from their demos and Royer and Rikk Agnew&#x27;s Detours songs. &quot;L.A. Girl&quot;, a new song, was written by Brandenburg in response to being rejected by a new classmate who had come to Magnolia High School from Los Angeles after her parents divorced. &quot;She made it very clear that I didn&#x27;t breathe the same atmosphere as her&quot;, he recalled 26 years later. &quot;I was trying to tell her we were on the same page, that I was her only ally. But like pretty much all the girls then, she just thought I was a dork, an insect.&quot; He wrote the song in response to the slight, later calling it an answer to the Doors&#x27; &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;. The song&#x27;s music, written by Frank Agnew, incorporates jarring shifts in tempo between fast, brash punk rock and slower heavy metal, which influenced later California bands. &quot;No one was doing that,&quot; Brandenburg recalled, &quot;and the only reason we did is that we were trying to be middle-class punk, but half the band also wanted to be Black Sabbath. Through the years, it seemed to really echo with people. People like NOFX, the Offspring, Rancid, the drummer in No Doubt (Adrian Young) — they have said how much it meant to them.&quot;

==Album cover==
For the album cover, Brandenburg asked Fancher to have someone design a typeface logo similar to Cheap Trick&#x27;s. Diane Zincavage designed the cover, and its simple composition—a blue field with &quot;Adolescents&quot; in red type—led to it being referred to as &quot;The Blue Album&quot;.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Adolescents&quot; was released in April 1981. One of the first hardcore punk records to be widely distributed throughout the United States, it became one of the best-selling California hardcore albums behind the Dead Kennedys&#x27; &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; (1980), selling over 10,000 copies. In a retrospective review, Jack Rabid of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5 and remarked that &quot;the debut from these five Orange County kids established the mid-tempo, punk-pop &#x27;Southern Cal sound&#x27;, led by the long, great, pummeling, Johnny Thunders-derived solos of the two Agnew brothers, Rikk and Frank... they&#x27;re super-catchy, heavy-riffing rock &amp; roll, proving again that punk was the true heir to the likes of Chuck Berry, Larry Williams, Bo Diddley, and Eddie Cochran.&quot;

==Legacy==

Though Rikk Agnew had contributed heavily to the album, tensions between him and the other band members led to him quitting the band just a few months after its release. He was replaced by Pat Smear, formerly of the Germs, and the band planned their first tour to support the album, intending for it to begin in late summer 1981 and last into the fall:. Smear did not want to tour, however, and left the band that June after only three months. He was replaced by Royer&#x27;s roommate, Steve Roberts, and the new lineup recorded the three-song &quot;Welcome to Reality&quot; EP in July, but broke up the following month, two months before the EP was released. &quot;Oddly enough, we&#x27;d never even made it out of California&quot;, Frank Agnew later said.

Greg Graffin, whose band Bad Religion became friends with the Adolescents and played shows with them in 1980–81, became disillusioned with the violence surrounding the Los Angeles punk rock scene of the time and found reassurance in Brandenburg&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, which spoke out against fans who used the aggressive music to justify fighting: &quot;Have you had enough violence? / Just to kill boredom, makes no sense / We&#x27;re not the background for your stupid fights / Get out of the darkness, it&#x27;s time to unite / Do you think you&#x27;re tough when you rip it up?&quot;

The Adolescents&#x27; &quot;Blue Album&quot; lineup reunited several times in subsequent years. The first was a reunion show in April 1986 at Fender&#x27;s Ballroom in Long Beach, California, which led to the band re-forming. They played more shows and began working on material for a new album, but Frank Agnew and Royer left after a few months. With further lineup changes, the Adolescents released two more albums over the next two years, &quot;Brats in Battalions&quot; (1987) and &quot;Balboa Fun*Zone&quot; (1988), then broke up again in April 1989. The &quot;Blue Album&quot; lineup reunited again for a show in December 1989 at the Reseda Country Club, which was recorded and released eight years later as the live album &quot;Return to the Black Hole&quot; (Amsterdamned Records, 1997). They reunited again in 2001 for more live performances, but Royer soon left, and Rikk Agnew left as well in 2003. Frank Agnew left after the band&#x27;s reunion album, &quot;OC Confidential&quot; (2005), and Brandenburg and Soto later continued as the Adolescents with other lineups. Material from &quot;Adolescents&quot; dominates the band&#x27;s live albums, accounting for 13 of 21 tracks on &quot;Live 1981 &amp; 1986&quot; (1989), 10 of 17 on &quot;Return to the Black Hole&quot; (1997), and 12 of 19 on &quot;Live at the House of Blues&quot; (2004).

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1998, Mike Boehm included &quot;Adolescents&quot; first in a list of &quot;Essential Albums, &#x27;78–&#x27;98&quot; giving an overview of Orange County punk and alternative rock, calling it &quot;an underground classic. The 13 songs defined the O.C. punk experience, back when punk was a beleaguered subculture. &#x27;Amoeba&#x27;, with lyrics by Royer, is a metaphoric account of a single-celled creature, read punk youth culture, growing in size and self-awareness under the scornful, dismissive eye of adult authority. &#x27;Kids of the Black Hole&#x27; was Rikk Agnew&#x27;s epic tribute to the hedonistic, comradely denizens of a Fullerton crash pad that cradled the fertile North County punk scene during 1979–80. The two songs introduced a massed, harmonized &#x27;octave guitar&#x27; blitz—an Orange County rock signature.&quot;

==Covers==
In the decades since its release, several artists have recorded cover versions of songs from &quot;Adolescents&quot;. In 2005, NOFX covered &quot;No Way&quot; for their 7&quot; of the Month Club while the Dropkick Murphys covered &quot;Who Is Who&quot; for the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;. In 2009, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker of Blink-182 covered &quot;Amoeba&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Endless Bummer&quot;, while Pulley covered &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; and the Briefs covered &quot;Who Is Who&quot; for &quot;Let Them Know: The Story of Youth Brigade and BYO Records&quot;.

<doc id="1299572" wikidata="Q3999002" url="?curid=1299572" title="Tripping the Light Fantastic (album)">
<text>Tripping the Light Fantastic is the debut studio album by the American rock band Lit. It was released on April 1, 1997, on Malicious Vinyl Records. The band eventually left the record label owning the rights to &quot;Tripping The Light Fantastic&quot;, and it was reissued on the band&#x27;s own label, Dirty Martini, with distribution through their then label RCA Records.

==Style==
&quot;Tripping the Light Fantastic&quot; is a heavy and aggressive album that incorporates elements of heavy metal, punk rock, power pop, folk and grunge.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the album a &quot;skillful but uninspired grunge rehash.&quot; &quot;The Grand Rapids Press&quot; noted that &quot;the sublime melodies that permeate &quot;Tripping the Light Fantastic&quot;, along with the instrumental surprises that dot its sonic landscape, hint at the band&#x27;s broader musical influences.&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; wrote that it &quot;dynamically fused alternative rock and power pop styles to great effect.&quot;

<doc id="1299578" wikidata="Q2304936" url="?curid=1299578" title="The Beatles' Story">
<text>The Beatles&#x27; Story is the sixth album by the English rock band the Beatles in the United States, issued on 23 November 1964 by Capitol Records. It is a documentary double album featuring interviews, press conferences, and snippets of original or orchestral versions of Beatles songs, with voice-over narration. The album&#x27;s original liner notes described it as a &quot;narrative and musical biography&quot; of Beatlemania. It was produced by Los Angeles–based songwriter and producer Gary Usher and disc jockey and lyricist Roger Christian, and narrated by John Babcock, Al Wiman and Christian.

Capitol issued the album in response to the Vee-Jay Records LP &quot;Hear the Beatles Tell All&quot;, a compilation of radio interviews with the band carried out by Los Angeles disc jockeys. The company also sought to compete with unauthorised Beatles interview records issued by the Radio Pulse Beat label, which released three such LPs hosted by Ed Rudy. &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot; peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2014, Capitol reissued the album as part of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot; box set.

==Development==
Originally, Capitol Records intended to create an album from the group&#x27;s show at the Hollywood Bowl, which took place on 23 August 1964. A recording was made of the concert, but the Beatles and their producer, George Martin, deemed it of insufficient quality due to the poor sound and the volume of the fans&#x27; screaming. &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot; nevertheless contains a 48-second excerpt of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; from the Hollywood Bowl performance. It was the first record to include a recording of the Beatles in concert.

Using audio from interviews and press conferences, interspersed with music, &quot;The Beatles Story&quot; was produced by Gary Usher and Roger Christian. Among the segments were items devoted to each of the four Beatles – John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr – and others on their manager, Brian Epstein, and Martin. The Hollyridge Strings performed the easy listening versions of the Beatles&#x27; songs heard on the album. The voice-over commentary was written and narrated by John Babcock and, on behalf of radio station KFWB of Hollywood, Al Wiman and Christian.

==Release and reception==

Capitol released &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot; in the US on 23 November 1964, on the same day as the band&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; single. The front cover of the LP contained individual photos of the band members, taken by photographer Joe Covello, above a Union Jack. The album spent 17 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. It peaked at number 7 on 2 January 1965 and remained in that position for three further weeks while the band&#x27;s new studio album, &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot;, was number 1. &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot; was certified a gold record by the RIAA on 31 December 1964. It was the Beatles&#x27; fifth Capitol album, all of which had been released within a year of the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in the US. Author Barry Miles comments that the documentary record was &quot;blatantly exploitative&quot; but this was insufficient to deter American fans.

The album was also issued in Canada. It was released by Toshiba EMI in Japan on the Apple label (in stereo) in a box set with a deluxe 24-page 12&quot;x12&quot; booklet that contains the entire text of the script in English and Japanese. The album was being prepared for release on digital audio tape in 1996, but when the format failed commercially the plan was scrapped.

In 2014, &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot; was made available on CD for the first time as part of the Beatles&#x27; box set &quot;The U.S. Albums&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes it as &quot;a tedious neo-documentary record&quot; and &quot;cornball show biz, with radio announcers delivering a spit-shined script designed to bridge segments between canned interviews&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, Darryl Sterdan said &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Story&quot; was a &quot;cash-grab&quot; by the record company and a &quot;50-minute mish-mash ... dashed off for early Christmas shoppers&quot;. He added: &quot;Amazingly, it went gold. This one is also new on CD. Really, they needn&#x27;t have bothered.&quot;

<text>The Boreal kingdom or Holarctic kingdom (Holarctis) is a floristic kingdom identified (1947) by botanist Ronald Good (and later by Armen Takhtajan), which includes the temperate to Arctic portions of North America and Eurasia. Its flora is inherited from the ancient supercontinent of Laurasia. However, parts of the floristic kingdom (and most of its Circumboreal Region) were glaciated during the Pleistocene and as a consequence have a very young flora. Cenozoic relicts found refuge in the southern and mountainous parts of the kingdom, especially in the Eastern Asiatic Region and southern North American Atlantic Region.

Good noted that many plant species of temperate North America and Eurasia were very closely related, despite their separation by the Atlantic Ocean and the Bering Strait.

Millions of years ago, before the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, North America and Eurasia were joined as a single continent, Laurasia. After the opening of the Atlantic, the continents were connected to one another periodically via land bridges linking Alaska and Siberia. Until a few million years ago, the global climate was warmer than at present, especially at higher latitudes, and many temperate climate species were distributed across North America and Eurasia via Alaska and Siberia. The sharply cooler climate of the past few million years eliminated a temperate-zone connection between North America and Eurasia, but common Laurasian origins and a long history of temperate-climate land bridges account for the botanical similarities between the temperate floras on the two continents.

A floristic kingdom is the botanical analogue to an biogeographic realm, which takes into account the distribution of animal as well as plant species. Many biogeographers distinguish the Boreal kingdom as comprising two realms, the Nearctic (North America) and Palearctic (North Africa and Eurasia). Others, based on the distribution of related plant and animal families, include the Palearctic and Nearctic in a single Holarctic realm, which corresponds to Good&#x27;s Boreal kingdom.

==Flora==
According to Takhtajan (1978), the following families are endemic to this kingdom: Ginkgoaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Glaucidiaceae, Hydrastidaceae (&quot;Hydrastis&quot;), Trochodendraceae, Tetracentraceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Euptelaceae (&quot;Euptelea&quot;), Platanaceae, Eucommiaceae, Rhoipteleaceae, Leitneriaceae, Paeoniaceae, Crossosomataceae, Stachyuraceae, Fouquieriaceae, Diapensiaceae, Simmondsiaceae, Pterostemonaceae, Penthoraceae, Bretschneideraceae, Limnanthaceae, Davidiaceae (&quot;Davidia&quot;), Toricelliaceae, Helwingiaceae, Theligonaceae, Dipentodontaceae, Cynomoriaceae, Adoxaceae, Trapellaceae (&quot;Trapella&quot;), Butomaceae, Scheuchzeriaceae, Aphyllanthaceae.

According to the same author, the following families are well represented: Magnoliaceae, Lauraceae, Ranunculaceae, Berberidaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae, Juglandaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Polygonaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Theaceae, Salicaceae, Brassicaceae, Ericaceae, Primulaceae, Malvaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Cornaceae, Araliaceae, Apiaceae, Rhamnaceae, Gentianaceae, Boraginaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Lamiaceae, Campanulaceae, Asteraceae, Liliaceae, Iridaceae, Orchidaceae, Juncaceae, Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Pinaceae, Cupressaceae, Aspleniaceae, Polypodiaceae.

==Subdivisions==

The kingdom is subdivided into three floristic subkingdoms and nine floristic regions.

===Boreal subkingdom===
* Circumboreal region
* Eastern Asiatic region
* North American Atlantic region
* Rocky Mountain region

===Tethyan subkingdom===
* Macaronesian region
* Mediterranean region
* Saharo-Arabian region
* Irano-Turanian region

===Madrean floristic region===
* Madrean region

<doc id="1299598" wikidata="Q1155742" url="?curid=1299598" title="Disposable Soft Synth Interface">
<text>Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI) is a virtual instrument (software synthesizer) plugin architecture for use by music sequencer applications. It was designed for applications running under Linux, although there is nothing specific to Linux in the interface itself. It is distributed under the terms of a combination of LGPL-2.1-or-later and some BSD licenses, all of which are free software licences.

== Features ==
DSSI is sometimes described as &quot;Linux Audio Developer&#x27;s Simple Plugin API&quot; (LADSPA) for instruments. LADSPA is an audio effects plugin architecture for filters, reverbs and other sound processing software tools, whereas DSSI was designed specifically for instrument plugins that generate sound from note events. DSSI extends LADSPA by adding note event delivery, but it also adds predefined program selections and a method for plugins to provide their own user interfaces, both of which may also be used by effects plugins.
This is partly because DSSI was intended to be a lightweight addition to LADSPA that would require little extra effort from authors of LADSPA hosts and plugins to support, and partly to avoid distracting too much developer effort from the Generalized Music Plug-in Interface (GMPI) plug-in initiative (which has since stalled). Perhaps as a partial consequence of this early offhand approach to publicity, the number of DSSI plugins available remains small. A successor which reunites the two standards LADSPA and DSSI is LV2.

DSSI hosts on Linux can also host some Virtual Studio Technology (VST) instruments (VSTi) for Microsoft Windows using the &quot;dssi-vst&quot; wrapper plug-in, which in turn makes use of the Wine compatibility layer. The major programs supporting DSSI are Qtractor, Renoise and Rosegarden.
