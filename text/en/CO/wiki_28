<text>Parvēz, Pērvaz, Parviz or Parvīs (— in Nastaliq, meaning &quot;fortunate, victorious&quot;; &quot;Parvēz&quot;, also &quot;Abarvēz/Aparvēz&quot;), is a Persian male given name, mostly popular in Iran, Central Asia, South Asia and among Azeris. It is also a very common surname.

&quot;Parvēz&quot;, &quot;Parvez&quot;, &quot;Parvīz&quot;, &quot;Parwez&quot;, &quot;Parwiz&quot;, &quot;Pervaiz&quot;, &quot;Pervaz&quot;, &quot;Pervez&quot;, &quot;Perviz&quot;, &quot;Parvase&quot;, or &quot;Purvez&quot; are usually the same name but with different spellings. Furthermore, pronunciation between these different spellings are generally extremely similar or identical. All of these are ultimately derived from the Middle Persian name Feroz, of which 
there are many variations, such as Piruz, Phiroze, Feroze, etc.

She has three half-siblings, her brother Fuuta, along with an older sister and a younger brother from her father&#x27;s previous marriages. Her grandfather Kazuki Sakamoto is an editor.

<text>The Atari Lynx is a 16-bit handheld game console developed by Atari Corporation and designed by Epyx, released in North America in 1989, with a second revision called Lynx II being also released worldwide in July 1991. It was the second and last handheld console to be released under the Atari brand, succeeding the handheld iteration of &quot;Touch Me&quot; from 1978. The following list contains all of the games released for the Lynx.

Unveiled at the January&#x27;s 1989 Winter Consumer Electronics Show as the Handy before being rechristened as the Lynx, the system was released to compete with 8-bit and 16-bit handheld consoles such as the Game Boy, Game Gear, and TurboExpress, initially starting off successfully. Due to stiff competition in the home console market at the time, Atari Corp. focused their resources into the Atari Jaguar before ceasing internal game development in 1996 and eventually discontinuing the platform. There were 71 officially released titles on cartridge during the system&#x27;s life span on the market, with 3 more titles being released after its discontinuation by Telegames. Originally released at US$179.99, Atari dropped the price to $99.99 when the Lynx II was launched. Its unknown how many Lynx units were sold but it has been suggested that between 1 and 3 million units were sold in total. Also listed are the unlicensed aftermarket (homebrew) titles.

== Commercially released games ==
Listed here are all officially released Atari Lynx games.

Note: Atari Lynx is a handheld console and therefore NTSC, PAL or NTSC-J does not matter.

<text>Lilia Andreyevna Kopylova (; born 18 June 1978) is a Russian professional dancer.

With her husband Darren Bennett, she has been competing as an amateur since July 1997 and as a professional since May 2003. The couple has achieved considerable success in the professional Latin style of dancing, both nationally in the UK and internationally.

==Biography==
Kopylova started ice skating aged four, winning the title of junior Moscow champion aged nine.

In 1987, she started training as a dancer. Her dance partner was Mikhail Batashov, a Danish champion, and in 1990 they won USSR competition; and a year later, they were the first Soviet pair of their age to be allowed abroad to dance. They won the 1990 Danish Open in Copenhagen, followed by success that same year in France and Italy.

In 1994, Kopylova represented Russia in the International dance championships in Denmark. In 1997, she was introduced to Darren Bennett and five months later, having moved to the UK, they won the International and British amateur Youth Championships in July 1997. The couple turned professional in 2003, and are now regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s finest Latin American dance couples and make regular appearances on British TV. Kopylova&#x27;s favourite dances are the rumba and the foxtrot.

In November 2005, Bennett and Kopylova won the British Championships for Professional Latin, coming first in all five dances. In November 2006, they successfully defended this title against a challenge from Olga Rodionova and Paul Richardson, who had previously been competing for the USA but had recently registered as a British couple. Bennett and Kopylova eventually triumphed, again winning all five dances to retain the title.

Other competitive highlights include winning the Rising Star professional Latin title of Blackpool Dance Festival in 2003, and reaching the final of the professional Latin competition in the 2005 Blackpool Dance Festival.

In February 2008, Bennett and Kopylova were winners of the Carl Alan Award for Ballroom, Latin and Sequence (performers)- a prestigious title described by the IDTA as &#x27;the Oscars of the world of dance&#x27;.

Bennett and Kopylova are part of the team behind the &quot;Essentially Dance&quot;, a scheme for British children to learn ballroom and Latin American dance, in a bid to tackle childhood obesity and promote social skills. Funded by the Aldridge Foundation and launched on 22 June 2009, it was filmed and produced by Winning Pitch TV.

The couple starred in a West End dance show, &quot;Latin Fever&quot;, which they choreographed themselves, as well as choosing the music and costumes to reflect the mood of each Latin dance.

More recently, Kopylova has been choreographer for Dancing with the Stars (Irish version) alongside her husband Darren Bennett who was the consultant creative producer.

== &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; ==
In Autumn 2004, Kopylova competed in the BBC One pro-celebrity ballroom dancing television programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, dancing with celebrity singer Aled Jones. They finished fourth overall and fourth in the following Christmas Champion of Champions show. Her husband Darren Bennett won both shows with Jill Halfpenny.

Kopylova won the 2005 series, partnered with Darren Gough, who was the first male celebrity to win the title. The couple went on to win the Christmas Champion of Champions trophy, including a dance with a perfect score of 40 out of 40. The show featured couples from the 2004 and 2005 series, as well as Rachel Hunter and Evander Holyfield from the US version of the show, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

Kopylova participated in the fourth series of the show partnered by Matt Dawson a former England Rugby Union scrum half. They were runners up, losing to Mark Ramprakash and Karen Hardy. This result made Kopylova the first, and as of 2009, the only professional dancer to make it to the top 2 twice. In the Christmas Special that year, they were the only couple from series four to receive a perfect ten from the judges.

In Series Five, she partnered presenter Dominic Littlewood. They were eliminated in the fifth round of the competition. She was also reunited with her Series Three partner Darren Gough for the 2007 Christmas Special, in which they received another perfect score for their American Smooth, and won the competition. In total, Gough and Kopylova have now won three Strictly trophies—more than any couple in the history of the show.

In January and February 2008, Kopylova competed in the live tour of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, again dancing with her Series Three partner Darren Gough. Performing at a number of venues across the UK, they were winners or runners up on numerous occasions.

She was knocked out in week five of the sixth series, paired with actor Don Warrington.

In January/February on the Strictly 2009 Tour, Kopylova danced with comedian Julian Clary.

In the seventh series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; beginning in September 2009, Kopylova was partnered by jockey Richard Dunwoody. The pair found themselves in the bottom 2 of the second week of competition against Flavia Cacace and Craig Kelly and were eliminated.

Kopylova is the head of the judging panel on the Turkish version &quot;Yok Böyle Dans&quot;.

=== Performances ===
==Personal life==
In January 1999, Kopylova married dance partner Darren Bennett. In December 2004, she became a British citizen. They have two daughters, born in 2015 and 2020.

<text>Yechezkel ben Yehuda HaLevi Landau (8 October 1713 – 29 April 1793) was an influential authority in halakha (Jewish law). He is best known for the work &quot;Noda Biyhudah&quot; (נודע ביהודה), by which title he is also known.

==Biography==
Landau was born in Opatów, Poland, to a family that traced its lineage back to Rashi, and attended &quot;yeshiva&quot; at Ludmir and Brody. In Brody, he was appointed dayan (rabbinical judge) in 1734.

In 1745 Landau became rabbi of Yampol. While in Yampol, he attempted to mediate between Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybeschütz in a debate—&quot;The Emden-Eybeschütz Controversy&quot;—that &quot;had disrupted Jewish communal life for many years&quot;. Emden had accused Eybeschuetz of being a crypto Sabbatean, primarily based on amulets Eybeschuetz had written, which Emden believed contained Sabbatean kabbalah. Landau proposed a compromise, in which all amulets allegedly written by Eybeschuetz would be hidden away, and Eybeschuetz would accept to refrain from producing any amulets in the future. Furthermore, all accusations against Eybeschuetz would stop, and no further polemics would be published. Landau&#x27;s role in the Emden - Eybeschuetz controversy is described as &quot;tactful&quot; and brought him to the attention of the community of Prague—where, in 1755, he was appointed rabbi. He also established a &quot;yeshiva&quot; there; Avraham Danzig, author of &quot;Chayei Adam&quot;, is amongst his best known students.

Landau was highly esteemed not only by the community, but also by others; and he stood high in favor in government circles. Thus, in addition to his rabbinical tasks, he was able to intercede with the government on various occasions when anti-Semitic measures had been introduced. Though not opposed to secular knowledge, he objected to &quot;that culture which came from Berlin&quot;, in particular Moses Mendelssohn&#x27;s translation of the Pentateuch.

His son, Samuel Landau (1752 – 31 October 1834, Prague), was chief dayyan of Prague. Landau was the champion of Orthodox Rabbinism, and when, at the end of the eighteenth century, the Austrian emperor planned the establishment of Jewish theological seminaries, Landau was one of the rabbis that objected thereto. He had a controversy on this subject with Baruch Jeiteles (Phinehas Hananiah Argosi di Silva), who, under the title of &quot;Ha-Oreb&quot;, published (Vienna, 1795) Landau&#x27;s letter to him and his own rejoinder. Landau published his responsa under the title of &quot;Shibat Ẓiyyon&quot; (Prague, 1827). He edited his father&#x27;s &quot;Ahabat Ẓiyyon&quot; and &quot;Doresh le-Ẓiyyon&quot; (ib. 1827), adding to the former work four homilies of his own, and to the latter a number of halakic discourses. [Jewish Encyclopedia]

==Works==
His main work of responsa, titled Noda Biyhudah (נודע ביהודה, &quot;Known in Judah&quot;, a reference to Psalms 76:2 and his father&#x27;s name), is one of the principal sources of Jewish law of his age. Famous decisions include those limiting autopsy to prevent a clear and present danger in known others. This collection was esteemed by rabbis and scholars, both for its logic and for its independence with regard to the rulings of other &quot;Acharonim&quot; as well as its simultaneous adherence to the writings of the &quot;Rishonim&quot;.

===Other works===
*&quot;Dagul Mervavah&quot; on the Shulkhan Arukh (cf. Song of Solomon 5:10)
*&quot;Tziyun le-Nefesh Chayah&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;Tzelach&quot;, named in reference to his mother, whose name was Chayah) on the Talmud.
*&quot;Drushei HaTzlach&quot;, a collection of sermons.
*&quot;Ahavas Tzion&quot;
*&quot;Doresh LeTzion&quot;

==Notable views==
===Returning to the Talmud===
Landau was disturbed by the increasing influence of non-Talmudic sources on the Jewish community. He believed that many kabbalistic concepts were being understood in a heretical fashion, and was especially concerned with the prospect of the kabbalistic ideology of the Sabbatean movement infiltrating the populace. Landau frequently spoke against teaching Kabbalah to the masses, and was echoed in this regard by his student, Elazar Fleckeles, who praised the government for instituting laws limiting the study of kabbalah. In his responsa, when asked about matters that had no source in the Talmud, Landau would often respond, &quot;it is not my way to study any issue which is not discussed in the Talmud&quot;. He responded in such a manner to inquiries about the ethical will of Rabbi Yehuda haChasid, which contains various instructions not found in the Talmud, a question about the proper manner of writing certain letters in the Torah scroll according to kabbalistic literature, and other similar questions.

===Opinion on the Zohar===
In his sefer &quot;Derushei HaTzlach&quot;, Landau argued that the Zohar can not be considered reliable, since it only came into the hands of the Jewish people many hundreds of years after Rashbi&#x27;s death, and thus lacks an unbroken &quot;mesorah&quot; as to its authenticity, among other reasons.

===Clashes with the haskalah movement===
Landau condemned the haskalah movement in harsh terms. In numerous public sermons, he campaigned against the study of heretical philosophy. He particularly singled out Hartwig Wessely for criticism after the publication of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Divrei Shalom V&#x27;emes&quot;, which advocated abandoning the traditional Jewish educational system, in favor of one with an emphasis on secular studies.

===Opposition to Chasiddus===
Landau was a staunch opponent of the nascent Hasidic movement. In one response, he writes &quot;...In this generation of ours [people] have abandoned God’s Torah and the source of living waters–the two Talmuds, Bavli and Yerushalmi–to dig for themselves broken cisterns. And in the haughtiness of their hearts they exalt themselves; each one says &quot;I am the one who sees, to me the gates to heaven have opened, and on my account the world is sustained&quot;. These [people] are the destroyers of the generation and of this orphaned generation I say that God&#x27;s ways are just, and the righteous shall walk in them, and the &quot;Chasidim&quot; shall stumble in them [This is an alteration of Hoshea 14:14, in which the prophet says that &quot;sinners&quot; will stumble in them.]...&quot;

===Opposition to the Sabbatean movement===
According to Sid Z. Leiman and Maoz Kahana, although Landau was extremely active in combating the Sabbatean movement, he believed the most effective means of eradicating it would be to aggressively counter overt Sabbateanism, while ignoring those Sabbateans who stayed hidden. Simultaneously, Landau sought to weaken the appeal of kabbalah (the study of which often lured people to the Sabbatean movement). Thus, Landau aimed to deprive the Sabbateans of any platform, and cause the Sabbatean movement to wither on its own. Besides the specific debate over the status of Jonathan Eybeschuetz, Jacob Emden expressed strong disagreement with Landau&#x27;s approach, advocating instead for a far more aggressive anti Sabbatean strategy.

<doc id="1276212" wikidata="Q383742" url="?curid=1276212" title="Afri Cola">
<text>Afri Cola is a cola soft drink produced in Germany. The trademark Afri-Cola was registered in 1931 by the company F. Blumhoffer Nachfolger GmbH. The same company also produced Bluna, an orange soft drink. Today the brand belongs to the Mineralbrunnen Überkingen-Teinach AG. Afri Cola was once one of the most popular cola brands in Germany, but has lost considerable market share since the 1960s.

== History ==
Afri-Cola was registered in 1931 by &quot;F. Blumhoffer Nachfolger GmbH&quot;, a company founded in 1864 and based in Cologne.

In 1932, Karl Flach flew to the US and came back with the idea to develop a German equivalent to Coca-Cola. After the Second World War, Afri-Cola became one of the most popular drinks in Germany and a symbol of the West German Wirtschaftswunder. In 1952, the company launched Bluna, an orange soft drink similar to Fanta, which also became a hit among customers. However, in the hard competition of the 1960s, Afri-Cola started to lose its influence on the German market to Coca-Cola and Pepsi. To update its image, the company hired designer and photographer Charles Wilp who created a controversial and attention-grabbing marketing campaign (with lustful nuns drinking Afri-Cola) which positioned the brand in Germany&#x27;s new-age landscape.

The market share of Afri-Cola continued to dwindle during the 1980s and 1990s. Eventually, in 1998, German beverage company Mineralbrunnen Überkingen-Teinach AG bought all rights to Afri-Cola and Bluna. This company changed the recipe of Afri-Cola in 1998; the taste differed from that of the original. Also, until 1998 the caffeine content was 250 mg/L, which is higher than the average. At the re-release, it had a content below 150 mg/L so that the content does not need to be listed on the bottle.

However, as with Coca-Cola&#x27;s New Coke, the new recipe was unpopular. The mixture was again changed to taste more like the original one, the caffeine content was increased in 2005 to around 200 mg/L and caffeine was again listed as an ingredient on the label. This mixture was also not sufficiently successful and on 1 April 2006, the company finally changed back to the original recipe, with caffeine content of 250 mg/L.

Afri-Cola was the only distributed soda during the G8 summit 2007 in Heiligendamm. In 2009, it was refused the registration of the trademark in international classes 29 and 30 (coffee, coffee substitutes, tea, salt, sugar, rice), sparking the legal debate around the word &quot;Afri&quot; in the brand&#x27;s name which deceptively leads consumers to believe at first that the drink is produced in Africa.

Since then, Afri-Cola has slightly regained market share.

==Availability outside Germany==
In the mid-1990s, Real Soda LLC, a U.S. company, started importing Afri Cola into the United States, largely in the Seattle area. At the time, it was marketed as &quot;highest caffeine content allowed by law&quot; and positioned to compete with such high-caffeine colas as Jolt Cola and Fukola Cola. In the late 1990s, it was widely available at convenience stores and supermarkets in Seattle and is available in several cafes in Minneapolis. For a short time, it was available at Carnegie Mellon University Student Union in Pittsburgh, the University of Rhode Island in their student union and at the University of Michigan at Backroom Pizza. In the early 2000s, it was available in the Reed College bookstore. Mineralbrunnen Überkingen-Teinach AG itself exports Afri-Cola to Austria, France, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.

Also in the 1980s, it was sold in Nigeria. It was sold in Ondo state, perhaps sold in the rest part of the country.

Afri Cola was relaunched in the US in May 2017 on the West Coast and in the New York area through importer Classic Beverage Imports working with various distributors. The USA product is in the same original high-caffeine formula and is sold in a version of the iconic Afri Cola glass bottle.

==In literature==
Afri Cola figures prominently in Volker Kutscher&#x27;s 2014 detective novel &quot;Märzgefallene&quot;, set in 1933 Berlin and Cologne. (English translation published in 2020 under the title &quot;The March Fallen&quot;.)

<text>Rosslare Strand, or simply Rosslare ( or &#x27;middle wood&#x27;), is a village and seaside resort in County Wexford, Ireland. The name Rosslare Strand is used to distinguish it from the nearby community of Rosslare Harbour, site of the Rosslare Europort.

==Tourism==
Rosslare has been a tourist resort for at least 100 years. It is noted as the &quot;sunniest spot in Ireland&quot;, and records bear this out: Rosslare has consistently more sunshine hours that any other part of Ireland. The long sandy strand is a Blue Flag beach. The beach itself consists of sand and stone running the length of the southern peninsula which protrudes into Wexford Harbour. It is segmented by a series of timber breakwaters which are designed to retain sandy deposits along the beach.
There are a number of golf courses in the vicinity. Rosslare also has several hotels, cafes and restaurants.

At the time of the 1996 census, the village had a population of 929 people, increasing to 1,795 by the time of the 2022 census. According to the April 2016 census, of the 551 occupied private households in the village, 228 were built between 2001 and 2010. During the early 21st century, the village saw an amount of building, including of a number of holiday homes. There are a number of housing estates of holiday homes near the strand, and the population reportedly grows from &quot;about 1,500 to 17,000&quot; during the summer months.

A long sandspit stretching north from Rosslare separates Wexford Harbour from the Irish Sea. Until the early 1920s, this spit stretched for many miles north, almost touching the Raven Point and giving a very narrow mouth to Wexford Harbour. At the end of the spit was a small fort called Rosslare Fort. In the winter of 1924-25 a storm breached the spit and it was gradually washed away. The fort was abandoned and now all that is left is an island at low tide.

==Climate==
Rosslare is commonly known in Ireland as being in the &quot;Sunny South-East&quot;, and in 1959 Rosslare recorded 1,996.4 hours of sunshine, the highest recorded in Ireland. However, it is not the warmest or driest place in Ireland.

Met Éireann operated a weather station at Rosslare until its closure in 2007. Sunshine duration for the county is now recorded at the Johnstown Castle weather station, which has been operational since 2009. However, due to its inland location, Johnstown Castle receives considerably less sunshine than Rosslare. 
==Transport==
===Rail transport===

Rosslare is served by Rosslare Strand railway station, which opened on 24 June 1882. The Dublin to Rosslare Europort railway serves the village.

===Bus transport===
Two main local bus services operate; &#x27;Wexford Bus&#x27; and &#x27;Local Link&#x27;.

The village is also served by Bus Éireann routes 370 and 385. The 370 links it to Wellingtonbridge, New Ross and Waterford (this bus route replaces the train service to Waterford which ceased in September 2010).

In November 2005 Bennett and Kopylova won the British Championships for Professional Latin, coming first in all five dances. In November 2006 they successfully defended this title against a challenge from Olga Rodionova and Paul Richardson, who had been competing for the USA but had recently registered as a British couple. Bennett and Kopylova triumphed winning all five dances to retain the title.

In February 2008, Bennett and Kopylova were winners of the Carl Alan Award for Ballroom, Latin and Sequence (performers)- a prestigious title described by the IDTA as &#x27;the Oscars of the world of dance&#x27;.

The couple starred in a West End dance show, &quot;Latin Fever&quot;, which they choreographed themselves, as well as choosing the music and costumes to reflect the mood of each Latin dance.

Bennett is a consultant creative producer for the Dancing with the Stars (Irish Edition) TV show working alongside his wife and choreographer Lilia Kopylova.

== &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; ==
He was one of the professional dancers on the BBC dancing television programme, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. This is a summary of how well he has done in the show:
* Series Two: Won with his partner, actress Jill Halfpenny.
* Christmas Special: Won with his partner from series two, Jill Halfpenny.
* Series Three: Knocked out in the third week with his partner, TV presenter Gloria Hunniford.
* Series Four: Knocked out in the semi-final after competing with singer Emma Bunton. They also competed together in the 2006 Christmas Special, finished in third place overall (the remaining couples were not ranked).
* Series Five: Knocked out in the quarter-final (fourth place) after competing with actress Letitia Dean. They also competed together in the 2007 Christmas Special, but were not placed in the final two overall (the remaining couples were not ranked).
*Live Tour 2008: Competing at a series of venues during January and February 2008 with Series Five partner Letitia Dean, they won once (31 January 2008), and were runners up on two further occasions.

<doc id="1276221" wikidata="Q2659146" url="?curid=1276221" title="The Fall Guy">
<text>The Fall Guy is an American action-adventure television series produced for ABC and originally broadcast from November 4, 1981, to May 2, 1986. It stars Lee Majors, Douglas Barr, and Heather Thomas as Hollywood stunt performers who moonlight as bounty hunters.

==Plot==
Colt Seavers (Lee Majors) is a Hollywood stunt man who moonlights as a bounty hunter. He uses his physical skills and knowledge of stunt effects (especially stunts involving cars or his large GMC pickup truck) to capture fugitives and criminals. He is accompanied by his cousin and stuntman-in-training, Howie Munson (Douglas Barr), and by fellow stuntwoman Jody Banks (Heather Thomas).

==Cast==
* Lee Majors as Colt Seavers 
* Douglas Barr as Howie &quot;Kid&quot; Munson
* Heather Thomas as Jody Banks
* Jo Ann Pflug as Samantha &quot;Big Jack&quot; Jack (1981–1982)
* Markie Post as Terri Shannon / Michaels (1982–1985)

==Production==
Seavers&#x27;s truck was a Rounded-Line 1981 GMC K-2500 Wideside with the Sierra Grande equipment package. A Rounded-Line 1980 GMC K-25 Wideside with the High Sierra equipment package was also used. During the show&#x27;s initial series, the stunts took their toll on the modified production trucks, supplied at low cost to the production by General Motors, so several different years, makes (Chevy/GMC), and models were used during the show&#x27;s initial run.

From the second season, General Motors supplied three specially adapted trucks for the stunt sequences, with the engine moved to a mid-chassis position immediately under the cab seat.

==Intros==

<text>Pinchas Menachem Alter (, June 9, 1926 – March 7, 1996), also known as the Pnei Menachem (), after the works he authored, was the seventh rebbe of the Hasidic dynasty of Ger, a position he held from 1992 until his death in 1996. From 1956 until he was appointed rebbe, he was a Rosh Yeshiva (dean of a yeshiva). He also served as a member and the president of the Torah Scholars Council and as the chairman of the Agudat Yisrael political party.

==Early years==
Alter was born in Falenica, near Warsaw, Poland. He was the only child of Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, the fourth rebbe of Ger, and his second wife, Feyge Mintshe Biderman. Alter had four half-brothers and two half-sisters from his father&#x27;s first marriage—including the fifth rebbe of Ger, Yisrael Alter, and Simcha Bunim Alter, the sixth rebbe of Ger.

After World War II he married his cousin Tzipora Alter. In 1956, he was appointed rosh yeshiva of &quot;Sfas Emes&quot;, the flagship yeshiva of Ger in Jerusalem, Israel.

==Succession as rebbe==
Alter succeeded his half-brother, Simcha Bunim Alter, as rebbe in 1992. His position as rosh yeshiva of Sfas Emes Yeshiva was assumed by his son, Shaul Alter.

As rebbe he continued the policies of his half-brothers Simcha Bunim and Yisrael by supporting the Agudat Israel of Israel political party, promoting Haredi Judaism in the Israeli Knesset (parliament). He reached an accommodation with non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi rabbis, in particular with Elazar Shach, leader of the rival Degel HaTorah party. Together, they created the United Torah Judaism (&quot;Yahadut HaTorah&quot;) party in order not to lose residual votes in the Israeli proportional representation system, and thereby potentially obtain an extra seat for the newly united party in Knesset elections.

==Death and burial==

Alter died in 1996 and was buried beside his father in the courtyard of the Sfas Emes Yeshiva. Unlike his father&#x27;s grave, which was dug by hand under the cover of darkness during the British curfew in 1948, his grave was dug with machinery and is therefore lower than his father&#x27;s. A red-brick ohel (tomb) was built over the two graves, which are visited frequently by students in the yeshiva.

He was succeeded as rebbe by his nephew, Yaakov Aryeh Alter, son of Simcha Bunim Alter.

In 2019 his son Shaul Alter formed his own followership of Ger Chasidim called Kehilas Pnei Menachem which is independent of the greater Ger sect.

<doc id="1276229" wikidata="Q944881" url="?curid=1276229" title="Dick Quax">
<text>Theodorus Jacobus Leonardus &quot;Dick&quot; Quax (1 January 1948 – 28 May 2018) was a Dutch-born New Zealand runner, one-time world record holder in the 5000 metres, and local-body politician.

Quax stood for Parliament for the ACT Party in 1999 and 2002. He was a Manukau City councillor from 2001 to 2007, when he stood unsuccessfully for mayor, and was a councillor on the Auckland Council from 2011 until his death in 2018.

== Athletic career ==
Quax won four New Zealand national athletics titles: the 5000 m in 1972, 1973, and 1974; and the one mile in 1969.

At the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, Quax won the silver medal in the 1500 metres. In the 5000 m, at the 1972 Summer Olympics he was eliminated in the heats, but he won silver in 1976. He did not compete in 1980 in Moscow due to the West&#x27;s boycott.

In 1977 at Stockholm Quax set a world record of 13:12.9 in the 5000 m. This record stood for less than a year, but as a national record it stood for over 31 years, until beaten by Adrian Blincoe in July 2008.

Early in 1980 at Stanford Stadium Quax missed Jos Hermens&#x27; 15 km world record by five seconds, running a New Zealand national record of 43:01.7. In his later career Quax switched his focus to the marathon, running 2:11.13 in his debut for 4th place at the Nike OTC Marathon in 1979, at that time the fastest debut marathon in history. In 1980 he returned and won the race in a New Zealand record time of 2:10.47. After retiring from competition, Quax established a career in sports management. He also coached his son, Theo, the New Zealand U18 and U20 Champion for 1500 m.

=== Personal bests ===
== Political career ==
Quax was a member of the ACT Party and stood in the in the electorate but was unsuccessful. He was ranked 11th on the ACT party list, which was too low to be elected from the list, as only the first 9 candidates got returned. He stood again in the 2002 general election.

In October 2001 Quax was elected to the Manukau City Council for the Pakuranga ward and was re-elected in 2004 to represent the new Botany-Clevedon ward after a failed bid for the Manukau City mayoralty. On 13 October 2007 Quax lost his bid to become mayor of Manukau City to Len Brown by 14,000 votes.

During this election, Quax complained to the electoral office over an &quot;offensive flyer&quot; depicting him and members of his People&#x27;s Choice party as the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. His complaint was not upheld as there was no evidence to suggest who had posted the flyers.

Quax stood for Citizens &amp; Ratepayers in the 2010 Auckland Council elections, losing to Jami-Lee Ross by 253 votes. In 2011 Quax was elected to the council after a by-election was held in Howick due to Ross resigning after becoming a Member of Parliament. He was re-elected unopposed in 2013.

During the 2013 Len Brown mayoral scandal, Quax took the opportunity for political payback against Brown, leading the call for him to resign for not declaring hotel upgrades as gifts. It emerged that Quax had also not filed returns on the gifts he had received during the previous term.

Quax was re-elected in the 2016 Auckland elections.

In his tenure as councilor, he opposed high density housing and public transportation, and supported selling Auckland&#x27;s council-owned water and wastewater supplier Watercare Services. While originally opposing the council&#x27;s proposed Unitary Plan, Quax later supported the plan in full. Quax was described by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; as &quot;right wing&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Quax and his family arrived in New Zealand from the Netherlands on 10 October 1954. According to an interview in the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; the family had travelled on the same ship as future Race Relations Commissioner Joris de Bres. Quax became a naturalised New Zealander in 1969.

Quax married three times, his third marriage being to Roxanne in August 1991. He had three children, with Theo being on the NAU Lumberjacks cross country team.

=== &quot;Quaxing&quot; ===

Quax tweeted in January 2015 about his disbelief that anyone in the Western world would go shopping by means of &quot;walking, cycling, or public transit.&quot; Twitter users responded by creating the hashtag &quot;#quaxing&quot;. The Public Address website voted &quot;quaxing&quot; as its word of the year 2015, followed by &quot;Red Peak&quot; and &quot;twitterati&quot;.

== Illness and death ==
It was revealed on 27 November 2013 that Quax had been undergoing treatment for throat cancer, which had been diagnosed two months earlier.

Quax died of cancer in Auckland on 28 May 2018, aged 70.

<doc id="1276234" wikidata="Q2294130" url="?curid=1276234" title="Harmonized System">
<text>The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, also known as the Harmonized System (HS) of tariff nomenclature is an internationally standardized system of names and numbers to classify traded products. It came into effect in 1988 and has since been developed and maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO) (formerly the Customs Co-operation Council), an independent intergovernmental organization based in Brussels, Belgium.

It is used by over 200 WCO member countries and economies as a basis for their Customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics as well as many other purposes.

==Structure==

The HS is organized logically by economic activity or component material. For example, animals and animal products are found in one section of the HS, while machinery and mechanical appliances are found in another. The HS is organized into 21 Sections, which are subdivided into 96 Chapters (Chapters 1 to 97 with Chapter 77 reserved for potential future use by the HS). The 96 HS Chapters are further subdivided into 1,228 headings and 5,612 subheadings in the current 2022 edition of the HS.

Section and Chapter titles describe broad categories of goods, while headings and subheadings describe products in more detail. Generally, HS Sections and Chapters are arranged in order of a product&#x27;s degree of manufacture or in terms of its technological complexity. Natural commodities, such as live animals and vegetables, for example, are described in the early Sections of the HS, whereas more evolved goods such as machinery and precision instruments are described in later Sections. Chapters within the individual Sections are also usually organized in order of complexity or degree of manufacture. For example, within Section X (&quot;Pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; Recovered (waste and scrap) paper or paperboard; Paper and paperboard and articles thereof&quot;), Chapter 47 provides for &quot;pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic materials&quot;, whereas Chapter 49 covers &quot;printed books, newspapers, and other printed matter&quot;. Finally, the headings within individual Chapters follow a similar order. For example, the first heading in Chapter 50 (&quot;Silk&quot;) provides for &quot;silk worm cocoons&quot; while articles made of silk are covered by the Chapter&#x27;s later headings.

The HS code consists of 6-digits. The first two digits designate the Chapter wherein headings and subheadings appear. The second two digits designate the position of the heading in the Chapter. The last two digits designate the position of the subheading in the heading. HS code 1006.30, for example, indicates Chapter 10 (&quot;Cereals&quot;), heading 10.06 (&quot;Rice&quot;), and subheading 1006.30 (&quot;Semi-milled or wholly milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed&quot;).

In addition to the HS codes and commodity descriptions, each Section and Chapter of the HS is prefaced by Legal Notes, which are designed to clarify the proper classification of goods.

To ensure harmonization, the Contracting Parties to the Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, have agreed to base their national tariff schedules on the HS Nomenclature and Legal Notes. Parties are permitted to subdivide the HS Nomenclature beyond 6-digits and add their own Legal Notes according to their own tariff and statistical requirements. Parties often set their customs duties at the 8-digit &quot;tariff code&quot; level. Statistical suffixes are often added to the 8-digit tariff code for a total of 10 digits. If the number of digits are more than 6, additional digits are called as the national subdivision.

Chapter 77 is reserved for future use by the HS. Chapters 98 and 99 are reserved for domestic use for the Contracting Parties to the HS Convention.

Since its creation, the HS has undergone several revisions to reflect changes in trade. These revisions eliminate some headings and subheadings describing commodities with low volume of trade and create new headings and subheadings that address new needs, for example, to reflect technological advancements or monitor goods posing environmental concerns. The current edition of the HS became effective on 1 January 2022.

==Classification==
The process of assigning HS codes is known as &quot;HS Classification&quot;. All products can be classified in the HS by using the &quot;General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System (&quot;GRI&quot;)&quot; that must be applied in strict order. HS codes can be determined by a variety of factors including a product&#x27;s composition, its form and its function. An example of a product classified according to its form would be whole potatoes. The classification will also change depending on whether the potatoes are fresh or frozen. Fresh potatoes are classified, under heading 07.01 (&quot;Potatoes, fresh or chilled&quot;), more specifically under subheading 0701.90 (&quot;Other&quot;), while frozen potatoes are classified, under heading 07.10 (&quot;Vegetables (uncooked or cooked by steaming or boiling in water), frozen&quot;), more specifically under subheading 0710.10 (&quot;Potatoes&quot;).

An example of a product classified according its material composition is a picture frame. Picture frames made of tropical wood are classified under heading 44.14 (&quot;Wooden frames for paintings, photographs, mirrors or similar objects&quot;)&quot;,&quot; more specifically under subheading 4414.10 (&quot;Of tropical wood&quot;). Picture frames made of plastic are classified under heading 39.24 (&quot;Tableware, kitchenware, other household articles and hygienic or toilet articles, of plastics&quot;)&quot;,&quot; more specifically under subheading 3924.90 (&quot;Other&quot;). Picture frames made of glass are classified under heading 7020.00 (&quot;Other articles of glass&quot;)&quot;,&quot; the &#x27;.00’ at the end indicates the heading is not further subdivided.

An example of a product classified according to its form is personal hygiene soap. When in the form of a bar, cake or moulded shape, such soap is classified under heading 34.01 (&quot;Soap&quot;, among others), then under 1-dash subheading 3401.1 (&quot;Soap and organic surface-active products and preparations, in the form of bars, cakes, moulded pieces or shapes, and paper, wadding, felt and nonwovens, impregnated, coated or covered with soap or detergent&quot;)&quot;,&quot; and under &quot;2-dash subheading 3401.11&quot; (&quot;For toilet use (including medicated products)&quot;). Conversely, liquid personal hygiene soap, depending on what is in the liquid, is classified under either subheading 3401.20 (&quot;Soap in other forms&quot;), or subheading 3401.30 (&quot;Organic surface-active products and preparations for washing the skin, in the form of liquid or cream and put up for retail sale, whether or not containing soap&quot;).

An example of a product classified according to its function is a carbon monoxide (CO) detector. If the CO detector captures and displays gas measurements, then it is properly classified under subheading 9027.10 (&quot;Gas or smoke analysis apparatus&quot;), under heading 90.27 (&quot;Instruments and apparatus for physical or chemical analysis (for example, polarimeters, refractometers, spectrometers, gas or smoke analysis apparatus; instruments and apparatus for measuring or checking viscosity, porosity, expansion, surface tension or the like; instruments and apparatus for measuring or checking quantities of heat, sound or light (including exposure meters); microtomes&quot;. If the CO detector does not capture and display gas measurements, then it is properly classified under subheading 8531.10 (&quot;Burglar or fire alarms and similar apparatus&quot;), under heading 85.31 (&quot;Electric sound or visual signaling apparatus (for example, bells, sirens, indicator panels, burglar or fire alarms), other than those of heading 85.12 or 85.30&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

Although every product and every part of every product is classifiable in the HS, very few are explicitly described in the HS Nomenclature. Any product for which there is no explicit description can be classified under a &quot;residual&quot; or &quot;basket&quot; heading or subheading, which provide for &quot;Other&quot; goods. Residual codes normally occur last in numerical order under their related headings and subheadings.

An example of a product classified under a residual heading is a live dog, which must be classified under heading 01.06, which provides for &quot;Other live animals&quot; because dogs are not covered by headings 01.01 through 01.05, which explicitly provide for &quot;live equine&quot;, &quot;live bovine&quot;, &quot;live swine&quot;, &quot;live sheep and goats&quot;, and &quot;live poultry&quot;, respectively.

==Applications==
As of 2022, there were more than 200 countries or economies applying the Harmonized System worldwide,

HS codes are used by Customs authorities, statistical agencies, and other government regulatory bodies, to monitor and control the import and export of commodities through:
* Customs tariffs
* Collection of trade data (international trade statistics)
* Rules of origin
* Collection of internal taxes
* Trade negotiations (e.g., the schedules of tariff concessions of the World Trade Organization)
* Transport tariffs and statistics
* Monitoring of controlled goods (e.g., wastes, narcotics, chemical weapons, ozone layer depleting substances, endangered species, wildlife trade)
* Other areas of Customs controls and procedures, including risk assessment, information technology and compliance.

Companies use HS codes to calculate the total landed cost of imported products and parts, and to identify selling and sourcing opportunities abroad.

==Challenges in classification for companies==

HS classification is not always straightforward. Many automotive parts, for example, are not classified under heading 87.08, which provides for &quot;Parts and accessories of the motor vehicles of headings 87.01 to 87.05&quot;. For example, automotive seats are classified as articles of furniture under heading 94.01, which provides for &quot;Seats (other than those of heading 94.02), whether or not convertible into beds, and parts thereof&quot;, and more specifically under subheading 9401.20, which provides for &quot;Seats of a kind used for motor vehicles&quot;.

In many jurisdictions, traders alone bear the legal responsibility to accurately classify their goods. However, due to a lack of familiarity with the rules of HS classification traders may inadvertently determine erroneous HS codes for their commodities. Depending on the severity of the infraction, incorrect classification can result in the imposition of non-compliance penalties, border delays or seizures, or denial of import privileges.

There are multiple resources available to traders to assist in properly classifying their goods including the following.

Global

* The Official Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized System, published by the World Customs Organization (WCO) (Paid publication)
* The WCO Trade Tools (WCO online database for the HS, Valuation and Origin, containing both free and paid content, with the legal text of the Harmonized System freely available) 

National or Regional

* The US Census &quot;Classify your Commodity&quot; engine
* Classify your Commodity video tutorial by US Census
* Explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union by the European Commission
* Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS), by U.S. Customs and Border Protection
* Binding Tariff Information (BTI), by the European Commission
* Informed compliance publications, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection
* Classification Guides, by HM Revenue &amp; Customs
* Harmonized Tariff Schedule as the principal US page with updated info about Tariffs.
* Integral System of Trade Information (SIICEX) by the Confederation of Associations of Custom Brokers of the Mexican Republic (CAAAREM). It provides updated information about tariffs and explanatory notes in order to import and export goods from/to Mexico. It compiles information of many national and international legal regulations.

Traders may sometimes resort to using HS code determination guides and other references to classify their traded commodities. These could include local databases published by authorities in other countries. However, such databases are not valid globally.

Many Customs authorities around the world allow traders to apply for an advanced HS classification ruling. Such rulings are legally binding in the countries they are issued in and give certainty to the trader. Provided the information supplied in the request was truthful and valid, they may also provide legal protection to the trader following the ruling if there are future questions on the classification of the goods.

<doc id="1276239" wikidata="Q8052425" url="?curid=1276239" title="Yeoju Institute of Technology">
<text>Yeoju Institute of Technology (or YIT) is a private higher educational institution in Yeoju County, southeastern Gyeonggi province, South Korea. As of 2012 the status of the institution has changed to a university. Several four-year programs have been established such as the school&#x27;s nursing program. Yeoju University has begun to develop an international studies program. A big number of students from China, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, and Burma have enrolled. These students mainly attend the college for Korean language training. Yeoju University is famous for its educational programs in Architecture, Civil engineering, Renewable energy development, Management and marketing.

There are many &quot;foreign instructors and professors&quot; employed at institute. A small extension campus is located in neighboring Icheon City, at a Hyundai/ KCC plant. The school has a strong focus on automotive technology, but offers training in a variety of other fields, including ceramic design, a field which is of considerable economic importance in Yeoju and Icheon.

==History==
The school was established by the Dongshin Educational Foundation. Governmental permission was received in 1992. The school admitted its first entering class in March 1993. It was known at that time as Yeoju Industrial Technical College, taking its present name two years later in 1995. The first international sisterhood relationship was established in the intervening year (1994), with Salt Lake Community College in the United States.

<text>A golden number (sometimes capitalized) is a number assigned to each year in sequence which is used to indicate the dates of all the calendric new moons for each year in a 19-year Metonic cycle. They are used in computus (the calculation of the date of Easter) and also in Runic calendars. The golden number of any Julian or Gregorian calendar year can be calculated by dividing the year by 19, taking the remainder, and adding 1. (In mathematics this can be expressed as (&quot;year number&quot; modulo 19) + 1.)

For example, 2025 divided by 19 gives , remainder 11. Adding 1 to the remainder gives a golden number of 12.

The golden number, as it was later called, first appears in a calendar composed by Abbo of Fleury around the year 1000. Around 1162 a certain Master William referred to this number as the golden number &quot;because it is more precious than the other numbers.&quot; The name refers to the practice of printing golden numbers in gold. The term became widely known and used, in part through the computistic poem &quot;Massa Compoti&quot; written by Alexander de Villa Dei around 1200.

<doc id="1276258" wikidata="Q6469864" url="?curid=1276258" title="Lady's Island Lake">
<text>Lady&#x27;s Island Lake () is a brackish lake in the south of County Wexford, Ireland.

The lake is technically a back-barrier seepage lagoon, one of only two in Ireland. The other is nearby Tacumshin Lake. The lake has no natural outlet, but is separated from the Atlantic Ocean at the southern end by a sand and gravel bar 200 m wide. Salt water seeps through the barrier, while fresh water flows into the lake from run-off from the land around the lake. This means that the lake is neither fresh nor salt water but somewhere in between.

The bar is breached or &quot;cut&quot; mechanically for drainage in an annual event locally known as the &quot;Cutting of the Lake&quot;. This is done by the Lady&#x27;s Island Lake Drainage Committee in association with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, but historical records mention the cut in the seventeenth century. The sandbar is also breached by occasional storms when salt water flows in from the sea, increasing the salt levels considerably. Wildlife in the lake must therefore be able to cope with variable levels of salinity.

The lake is an important breeding ground for terns. It is estimated that the lake is home to over 1,200 breeding pairs of Sandwich terns and, more importantly, to 150 breeding pairs of the rare roseate tern; this is the second largest colony in Europe.

At the north end of the lake is the village of Lady&#x27;s Island or Our Lady&#x27;s Island. The &#x27;island&#x27; itself has been joined to the mainland by a causeway, so it is actually a peninsula sticking out into the lake from the village. On the peninsula are a castle, a leaning tower, church ruins and a graveyard. The leaning tower is a small stone tower which was built on unstable ground and now leans at an angle. The space in front of the castle is a pilgrimage site associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary: the pilgrimage takes place in August each year, when believers come from all over Ireland to gather and pray.

==Public transport access==
Bus Éireann route 378 provides a link between Wexford railway station and Our Lady&#x27;s Island on Fridays.

<doc id="1276277" wikidata="Q6115387" url="?curid=1276277" title="Jack Sugden">
<text>John Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Sugden is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. The character was originally played by Andrew Burt from 1972 to 1973 with a brief return in 1976, when the actor left for Italy to write a book. On his return in 1980 he was played by Clive Hornby. Hornby remained in the role until 2008 when he was forced to take a break from Emmerdale due to illness. His last on-screen appearance was on 21 February 2008, and his absence was explained by the character visiting his mother, Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier) in Spain. Although Hornby was intended to return, he died from his illness in July 2008 without returning to the programme. Jack was written out following Hornby&#x27;s death, dying off-screen of a heart attack in February 2009.

==Creation and casting==
Jacob and Annie Sugden&#x27;s son Jack is one of the original characters in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. The Sugden family were the owners of Emmerdale Farm from the programme&#x27;s early days. Jack and his younger siblings, Peggy Skilbeck and Joe all worked on the farm.

From the early days, Jack appeared to be a very rebellious and self-righteous character who cared little for others&#x27; views. He also has numerous flings with different women and failed marriages, due to his infidelity. Jack is an intelligent and articulate man but shown to keep secrets from his family. As time passed and Jack became a father, he has matured much more. He has firmly secured his roots in farming, which he originally tried so hard to escape from. Jack is still a man of principles and of pride, which can sometimes be his biggest weakness.

Jack was initially played by Andrew Burt, who appeared in over 100 episodes. Burt left the role in 1973 in order to work in the theatre again. Burt reprised the role in 1976. The role was then recast to Clive Hornby, who first appeared as Jack in 1980. Hornby departed the role due to ill health in 2008.

In 1997, Hornby was filming a scene which included Jack pushing a tractor when he got injured. He was rushed to hospital with a collapsed lung and spent eight days recovering. Speaking of the incident, Hornby said “It’s all right now but it made me realise that I never wanted to spend eight days again in a hospital.&quot;

==Storylines==
===1972–1973===
Jack returns to Beckindale on the day of Jacob&#x27;s funeral. He watches the procession from The Woolpack and
wanders around the farm. Following the funeral, Jack meets Marian Wilks and then enters the farmhouse and is met with a frosty reception from his sister, Peggy who resents Jack as he has returned to the village for the first time in eight years without a word and has inherited the farm, which has caused bad feeling between her and their brother, Joe. Jack&#x27;s mother Annie tells him he is welcome to stay but must help. Later, Jack quarrels with Marian when he finds out her father Henry was a partner in a company that poisoned local fish and suggests it may have been done deliberately. Jack agrees to surrender the farm to Peggy but Annie insists Jack makes the farm work. Jack then takes an interest in an old Millhouse which has a preservation order on it and plans to restore it and later reside there. He also has many a heated discussion with Henry over land access. Wallace, a friend of Jack arranges a meeting between him and a mystery woman named Lynn. Around this time, Marian and Jack become close much to Joe&#x27;s chagrin. When Lynn arrives, everyone is intrigued. Jack reveals that Lynn is his common-law wife from his time in London.

When Ruth, Tom and their children Jackie, Sandie and Tommy arrive in the village, Jack offers Tom a job as a farmhand but regrets it as Tom is proven to be lazy and fires him. Tom retaliates with blackmail, threatening to tell Marian that Jack is the biological father of his son, Jackie. Tom&#x27;s suspicions come from Jackie&#x27;s likeness to Jack, sharing the names John Jacob and knowing of Ruth&#x27;s past relationship with Jack. Jack refuses to give in and fires Tom. Marian finds out and the Merricks leave.

When Jack comes into some money, the family are suspicious of its source and discover Jack wrote a successful novel while in London. Marian is curious and enjoys the book but is ultimately unimpressed with the sexist views. Jack battles with Henry over a piece of land that Harry Jameson (John Glyn-Jones), an old friend of Jacob&#x27;s, is selling. Harry tries to get them to increase their offers but Jack knows Harry is desperate and he accepts Jack&#x27;s offer. He consults a solicitor and has the farm shared between Annie, Joe, Peggy and their grandfather, Sam Pearson (Toke Townley) but Sam, not wanting the responsibility, sells his share to Henry. After Peggy dies in October 1973, Jack returns to London.

===1980–2008===
He returns in February 1980, vowing to stay for good as he wanted to settle down. Ruth, now calling herself &quot;Pat&quot;, returns to the village with Jackie (now played by Ian Sharrock) and her daughter, Sandie Merrick (Jane Hutcheson) after leaving Tom for good and reunites with Jack. During this time, Jackie discovers that Jack is his biological father and takes the news badly and there is an unease between the two. In October 1982, Jack and Pat marry but less than two years into the marriage, Jack begins an affair with local newspaper reporter, Karen Moore (Annie Hulley). Pat finds out and demands Jack chooses between her and Karen and he chooses Pat and they reconcile. In 1985, Pat learns she is pregnant and gives birth to Jack&#x27;s second son, Robert (Richard Smith), on 22 April 1986. Jack is left devastated when Pat dies in a car crash four months later, leaving him to bring up Robert on his own. 

After a lengthy period of grieving, Jack begins dating again when he meets mobile librarian, Sarah Connolly (Madeleine Howard), in 1988; Sarah also becomes a mother figure to Robert. Jackie dislikes Sarah at first and feels she is trying to replace Pat but warms to her thanks to intervention from his wife Kathy (Malandra Burrows). Jack is left bitter and angry when Jackie dies in a shooting accident in August 1989 and Sarah is there for him. The couple move in together in 1990, and Jack often proposes but she keeps turning him down. Sarah falls pregnant in 1993 and gives birth to a daughter in March 1994, Victoria (Jessica Heywood) whose crying wakes up Annie, who had been knocked comatose following a plane crash in which Jack became one of the heroes of the hour by helping rebuild the destroyed Skipdale Bridge. Jack and Sarah marry in May 1994 and in the same month the village is renamed Emmerdale.

Jack faces more grief when he learns of Joe&#x27;s death in a car crash in Spain in June 1995 and is inconsolable and is unable to attend the funeral due to a bad back. Jack and Sarah&#x27;s marriage is tested when Jack has a fling with Sarah&#x27;s friend and Jack&#x27;s former stepniece, Rachel Tate (Glenda McKay) but they reconcile. The Sugdens adopt Andy Hopwood (Kelvin Fletcher) a school friend of Robert (now Christopher Smith). By the end of the 1990s, Jack and Sarah&#x27;s marriage is in trouble again when Jack suggests Robert and Andy work on the farm rather than attend school and money problems worsen. They take in a lodger, Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont) and Sarah, feeling neglected, begins an affair with Richie and leaves Jack. Sarah gets custody of Victoria (now Hannah Midgley) and Jack gets custody of Robert and Andy. Andy sets the barn on fire to help Jack claim on the insurance but the plan goes wrong when Sarah is killed and Jack is arrested as the chief suspect. Andy comes clean to Richie about the fire and begs him to change his statement and he agrees, resulting in Jack&#x27;s freedom.

Jack later begins dating Woolpack landlady Diane Blackstock (Elizabeth Estensen). When Andy discovers Robert (now Karl Davies) is having an affair with his wife, Katie (Sammy Winward), he waits for Robert in his caravan with a shotgun, intending to shoot him but accidentally shoots Jack instead. Having almost died, Jack initially disowns Andy but they reconcile and Jack and Diane plan to marry but she reveals that she had colon cancer and undergoes chemotherapy. The couple married and enjoy a honeymoon in Las Vegas while Diane recovered. Further drama ensues when Jack learns Andy is the father of 15-year-old Debbie Dingle&#x27;s (Charley Webb) daughter, Sarah, but supports Andy when he said he wanted to be a hands-on father, impressed with how responsible Andy had become. After a revenge attempt against Andy for killing Sarah backfires, resulting in the tragic death of Max King (Charlie Kemp), Jack banishes Robert from the village.

Jack and Diane assume responsibility for Andy&#x27;s half-brother, Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor), as Jack and Sarah did with Andy a decade earlier. Andy and Daz&#x27;s father, Billy (David Crellin), is released from prison and returns to Emmerdale much to the ire of various residents, having robbed the Post Office and killed Vic Windsor (Alun Lewis) on Christmas Day 1998. During this time, Billy works to prove he has changed and begins an emotional affair with Diane. Diane, riddled with guilt, confesses and she and Jack separate but later reconcile following Victoria (now Isabel Hodgins) discovering of the truth about her mother&#x27;s death. Jack visits Annie in Spain in 2008 and remains for several months until Annie informs the family of Jack&#x27;s death of a heart attack on 5 February 2009, leaving them devastated.

Diane brings Jack&#x27;s body back from Spain, along with his mother Annie, making her first return to her old home in 13 years. Val (Charlie Hardwick) and Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) arrange his funeral. Jack is buried in the village churchyard. Andy, Daz, Sam (James Hooton) and Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) are pallbearers. Just before the service, Alan Turner (Richard Thorp) recalls to Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) a conversation where Jack had told him about the events of Jacob&#x27;s funeral. Diane reads a letter Jack had written for Andy, Victoria, Daz and Robert during the service, telling them that he loved them and wanted them to live together as a family and reveals that he knew in his last weeks that he would not live to see the village again. Andy breaks down in tears and flees the church. As Jack is laid to rest, Diane places his chequered cap onto the coffin. Andy sees Robert, who is watching from a distance and drives away. Robert leaves a flower on the grave before leaving again. That afternoon, Val put a framed photo of Jack up next to the pictures of Amos and Henry Wilks in the pub. Andy, Diane, Daz and Victoria visit the grave that night to say a last goodbye. As they walk away, Diane looks back and sees a vision of Jack next to the grave. He smiles at her and she smiles back and realises that Jack will always be with her and the children and would be looking down on them.

==Reception==
A writer from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called Jack a &quot;literary-minded farmer forever battling with his younger brother Joe&quot;. Craig Jones from &quot;LeedsLive&quot; called Jack one of the show&#x27;s &quot;most iconic characters&quot;, whilst Rachel McGrath from &quot;HuffPost&quot; wrote that the character was &quot;much-loved&quot;. Rianne Houghton from &quot;Digital Spy&quot; called him a &quot;legend&quot; and wrote that he was &quot;considered by many to be a good guy&quot; despite his &quot;occasional inter-marital indiscretions&quot;.

In October 2016, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; aired scenes where Robert (now Ryan Hawley) tells his boyfriend Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller) that Jack had &quot;leathered&quot; him when Robert was 15 years old after catching him with another boy. This revelation divided fans, with some criticising the show&#x27;s retcon and debating whether Jack would be capable of that action, as well as accusing the show of ruining the character. However, others praised the decision to revealing a less nice side to Jack and thought it was a bold decision. Houghton from &quot;Digital Spy&quot; did not think that Jack would be abusive and noted that fans were &quot;shocked&quot; and that some were &quot;less than impressed&quot;.

<text>Yaakov Aryeh Alter (, , born 18 May 1939) is the eighth, and current, Rebbe of the Hasidic dynasty of Ger, a position he has held since 1996. He lives in Israel, and has followers there and in the United States, Europe, and Canada. He is a member of the Presidium of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudath Israel.

==Life==
Yaakov Aryeh Alter was born on 18 May 1939, 29 Iyar 5699 in Łódź, Poland, to Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter, also known as the &quot;Lev Simcha&quot;, who later became the sixth Gerrer Rebbe, and Yuta Henya, daughter of Rabbi Nehemiah Alter, his grandfather&#x27;s brother. He was named after his ancestor Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Guterman of Radzymin. In 1940, he immigrated, with his father and grandfather (Rebbe Avraham Mordechai Alter), to Eretz Israel. He studied in the Talmud Torah Etz Chaim. For many years, he studied Torah at a synagogue known as &quot;Rashi Shtiebel&quot; in Bnei Brak. He married Shoshana, daughter of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Weitz, one of the heads of Yeshivat Chiddushei HaRim.

Alter is one of the wealthiest people in the Haredi sector and in Israel in general, and in 2012, he was ranked third on the list of the richest rabbis in Israel, with a net worth of approximately NIS 350 million to NIS 500 million (between approximately $95 million and $135 million) due to real estate investments his father made in north Tel Aviv, Arsuf, and Jerusalem before Israel&#x27;s establishment. Despite his wealth, he lived in an apartment in an ordinary residential building in the Chazon Ish neighborhood in Bnei Brak until 2011, when he moved to Jerusalem.

He and his wife have five sons and four daughters. In 2019, it was reported that one of Alter&#x27;s sons was accused of sexually molesting two young male students from amongst Alter&#x27;s followers.

In 1996, after the passing of Pinchas Menachem Alter, his nephew Yaakov Aryeh Alter became the Rebbe of Ger.

In 2007, approximately 50,000 people attended the wedding of Alter&#x27;s oldest grandson in Jerusalem.

In 2016, Alter&#x27;s followers were estimated at 11,859 families. 

In 2019, Alter&#x27;s cousin Shaul Alter and his followers split off, forming Kehilas Pnei Menachem. As of 2021, membership of Shaul Alter&#x27;s breakaway faction consisted of some 500 families.

In 2022, an estimated 60,000 people, including Rabbis Yisrael Meir Lau, Yitzhak Yosef, Yitzchok Zilberstein, and Nachum Dov Brayer, attended the wedding of Alter&#x27;s granddaughter.

<text>The Councils of Sirmium were the five episcopal councils held in Sirmium in 347, 351, 357, 358 and finally in 375 or 378. The third—the most important of the councils—marked a temporary compromise between Arianism and the Western bishops of the Christian church. At least two of the other councils also dealt primarily with the Arian controversy. All of these councils were held under the rule of Constantius II, who was sympathetic to the Arians.

==Background==

Arianism was first put forward early in the 4th century by the Alexandrian presbyter Arius. It held that the Father is uniquely self-existent and immutable: consequently, Christ could not be God. The opponents of Arianism led by Athanasius of Alexandria claimed that the doctrine reduced Jesus to a demigod thus restoring polytheism as Jesus would still be worshipped. Further, it appeared to undermine the concept of redemption as only one who was truly God could reconcile man and God.

The First Council of Nicaea in 325 appeared to have settled the issue with Arius and his theology condemned and the Nicene Creed issued stating the Son was &quot;of one substance with the father&quot; (&quot;homoousion to Patri&quot;). However, Arians made a sustained effort to return to the church and to restore their beliefs after 325 with a prolonged theological dispute ensuing.

==First and Second Councils of Sirmium==

Constantine the Great died in 337, leaving Constantius II, who favored Arianism, as emperor in the East and Constans, who favored Nicea, emperor in the West. A church council held at Antioch in 341 issued an affirmation of faith that excluded the homoousion clause; another council held at Serdica in 342 (now Sofia) achieved little.

Constantius, who had a residence in Sirmium, convened the first Council of Sirmium in 347. It opposed Photinus, the bishop of Sirmium, an anti-Arian who held a belief similar to Marcellus.

In 350, Constantius became the sole Emperor of both East and West, leading to a temporary strengthening of Arianism.

At the second Council of Sirmium in 351, Basil, bishop of Ancyra (now Ankara) and leader of the semi-Arians, had Photinus deposed. The semi-Arians held that the Son was &quot;of similar substance&quot; (&quot;homoiousios&quot;) to the Father. Sirmium II also drafted the Sixth Arian Confession, which was an expanded version of the Fourth Arian Confession and was consistent with the strength of the semi-Arians.

==Third and Fourth Councils==

Councils were held in Arles in 353 and Milan in 355, with Athanasius condemned at both. In 356, Athanasius began his third exile, and George was appointed bishop of Alexandria.

The third Council of Sirmium, in 357, was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both &quot;homoousios&quot; (of one substance) and &quot;homoiousios&quot; (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium)
But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin &quot;substantia&quot;, but in Greek &quot;ousia&quot;, that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to &#x27;coessential,&#x27; or what is called, &#x27;like-in-essence,&#x27; there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men&#x27;s knowledge and above men&#x27;s understanding;

A Council of Ancyra in 358, chaired by Basil, released a statement using the term &quot;homoousios.&quot; But the fourth Council of Sirmium, also in 358, proposed a vague compromise: it said simply that the Son was &quot;homoios&quot; (&quot;like&quot;) the Father.

Ursacius of Singidunum and Valens of Mursa soon proposed a new creed, drafted at the Fourth Council of Sirmium in 359 but not presented there, holding that the Son was similar to the Father &quot;according to the scriptures,&quot; and avoiding the controversial terms &quot;same substance&quot; and &quot;similar substance.&quot; Others favored the creed of Nicaea.

The opponents of Sirmium wrote a letter to the emperor Constantius, praising Nicaea and condemning any reconsideration of it, before many of them left the council. The supporters of Sirmium then issued the new creed and sent it through Italy.

The council was considered a defeat for trinitarianism, and Saint Jerome wrote: &quot;The whole world groaned, and was astonished to find itself Arian.&quot;

==Recent theory==
T.D. Barnes suggests that the only extant reference to the &quot;first Council of Sirmium&quot; is in fact a wrongly-dated reference to the Council of Sirmium in 351. He then posits that the councils of 357 and 358 consisted of only a handful of participants and were not really councils. After examining the primary documents he concludes: &quot;In sum, the only formal and well-attested Council of Sirmium during the reign of Constantius is the council of 351 which condemned Athanasius, Marcellus, and Photinus and promulgated the creed which was subsequently presented to the Councils of Arles and Milan.&quot;

<doc id="1276286" wikidata="Q2319549" url="?curid=1276286" title="St Johns Beacon">
<text>St Johns Beacon (also known as the Radio City Tower) is a former radio and current observation tower in Liverpool, England. Designed by James A. Roberts Associates, it was built in 1969 and opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The tower is tall, and is the second-tallest free-standing structure in Liverpool. It has a long antenna on the roof, making it the tallest structure in Liverpool when antennas are included. 

As testament to the importance of its design, which was described by Historic England as &quot;embodying the technological bravura and spirit of the space age&quot;, the building was listed at Grade II in November 2020.

The building served as the base of the local commercial radio station Hits Radio Liverpool (formerly Radio City) alongside its sister station, Greatest Hits Radio, from 2000 to 2024.

== Early history ==
At the top of the tower was a luxury five-star revolving restaurant, the façade and floor of the restaurant revolving as one unit, while the roof was used as an observation platform for visitors. There are 558 stairs up to the top, and two lift shafts with lifts reaching the top in 30 seconds.

The tower is structurally independent of the adjacent shopping centre, with a simple foundation onto sandstone. The foundation is in diameter, deep and begins below Houghton Street. It has a tapering shaft that was built using slip-formed concrete. The crow&#x27;s nest structure at the top was added after the shaft was formed.

The original restaurant closed in 1979 for health and safety issues. It was re-opened, with a reduced capacity and additional fire prevention measures, during the early 1980s. The restaurant was eventually re-fitted as a Buck Rogers space-themed restaurant in 1983, but closed again for lack of business. After this the observation deck and the restaurant remained closed.

In the following years, the tower lay empty and derelict. Often considered to be an eyesore or a white elephant by fellow Liverpudlians, blue &quot;UFO style&quot; neon strip lights were added to the perimeter of the tower in 1994 in an attempt to increase its attractiveness. These were later removed upon the refurbishment of the tower.

In late 1998, Radio City, owned and operated by the then Emap Radio, expressed interest in refurbishing the tower to house Radio City and Magic 1548, including their studios and required office space. 

Work commenced in 1999 and was completed in the summer of 2000.

== Later history ==
The tower was refurbished between 1999 and 2000 at a cost of £5 million. It reopened as Radio City 96.7 (and Magic 1548) in August 2000. The outdoor observation deck, which had been located on the roof of the restaurant, was transformed into a second floor. It now holds the offices for the radio station. The studios are on the lower floor, which was previously the restaurant. The original revolving structure and machinery were left intact during the refurbishment. Brackets were added to lock the moving structure in place.

The tower has been known to sway in heavy winds. This is a design feature and common in construction within skyscrapers and tall buildings in order to prevent structural damage from wind pressure.

During the refurbishment between the first and second floors, the &quot;Radio City 96.7&quot; lettering was added. Until 17 April 2024 it was illuminated in yellow at night. Following the rebranding of Radio City as Hits Radio, the signage is no longer illuminated.

Lights were added under the base of the crow&#x27;s nest structure, which are illuminated all day and periodically change colour. The second floor windows are sometimes illuminated at night, often with a particular colour to mark certain events.

The refurbishment added an advertising framework at the top of the tower, designed for both a fabric banner and illuminated light boxes.

Window cleaning and exterior maintenance is performed by specialist teams, who abseil down the side of the tower from the roof.

The roof houses the local 10C Digital Audio Broadcasting multiplex for Liverpool. Hits Radio Liverpool and Greatest Hits Radio do not directly broadcast from the roof. Their FM signal is transmitted by the Allerton Park Transmitter, along with BBC Radio Merseyside on 95.8FM.

In 2017, the Liverpool-based tech startup Scan and Make organised the first edition of the art contest exhibition &quot;Making Art 4.0&quot; in the Radio offices.

In 2018, an artwork banner was displayed on the beacon&#x27;s advertisement framework. It was titled &quot;Liverpool 2018&quot;, celebrating 10 years since the city&#x27;s 2008 European Capital Of Culture events.

Radio City Talk ceased broadcasting on 31 May 2020, after it was deemed not financially viable due to low listening figures.

Until December 2024, the building housed the studios and offices for the regional programming of Hits Radio Liverpool and Hits Radio Lancashire, as well as the national weekday breakfast show for Greatest Hits Radio.

On 28 October 2024, Bauer Media announced that it would be vacating St Johns Beacon after 24 years, following a decision not to renew the lease. The final breakfast show to be broadcast from the building aired on 24 December 2024.

== St Johns Beacon Viewing Gallery ==

In 2010, the building&#x27;s first floor was opened full-time to members of the public upon paying an entrance fee. As of 2024, the fee was £8.00 for adults and £6.00 for children. Visitors could spend as long as they wish in the tower. The gallery gave the opportunity to view Liverpool from a 360° panoramic view, above the ground.

The viewing gallery closed on 31 December 2024.

== Failed zip wire proposal ==
In late June 2020, ZipWorldUK proposed plans for a permanent £5 million zip wire to be installed in Liverpool City Centre, which would have started from the second floor of the Beacon and end on the roof of the Central Library. The project attracted mixed public opinions, with many people claiming that it would be a permanent defacing of one of the city&#x27;s world famous landmarks. Others expressed concerns that the noise of the zip wire could disturb library users. The plan went before Liverpool City Council and on 30 June 2020 the plans were approved, however, on 2 September 2020 it was reported that Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson was withdrawing permission for this use of the Central Library, effectively vetoing the proposal.

<doc id="1276293" wikidata="Q1726940" url="?curid=1276293" title="John J. Williams (politician)">
<text>John James &quot;Whispering Willie&quot; Williams (May 17, 1904 – January 11, 1988) was an American businessman and politician from Millsboro, Delaware. He was a member of the Republican Party and served four terms as U.S. senator from Delaware from 1947 to 1970.

==Early life and family==
Williams was born on a farm near Frankford, Sussex County, Delaware, the ninth of eleven children. In 1922, he moved to Millsboro, where he and his brother Preston established the Millsboro Feed Company, a livestock and poultry feed business. John Williams married Elsie Steele in 1924; they remained married until his death 64 years later. In 1946, he served on the Millsboro Town Council.

==United States Senate==
Williams was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1946, defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator James M. Tunnell. During this term, he served in the Republican majority in the 80th Congress, but was in the minority in the 81st and 82nd Congresses. He was elected to a second term in 1952, defeating Democrat Alexis I. du Pont Bayard, and once again served in the Republican majority in the 83rd Congress, but returned to the minority in the 84th and 85th Congresses. Williams was elected to a third term in 1958 and a fourth term in 1964, both times defeating Democrat Elbert N. Carvel, who at the time of the 1964 election was Governor of Delaware. During these terms Williams served in the Republican minority in the 86th through the 91st Congresses. In all, he served for 24 years, from January 3, 1947, until December 31, 1970, when he resigned just before the end of his fourth term. He served during the administrations of U.S. presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. Williams was Delaware&#x27;s first four-term U.S. senator.

In the Senate, Williams established himself as an opponent of wasteful government bureaucracy. A proponent of free markets, he objected to President Truman&#x27;s continuation of many New Deal and World War II policies. Williams supported tax cuts, opposed the continuation of price controls, and suggested the federal budget could be balanced by slashing one million federal jobs he felt were unnecessary after the Great Depression and World War II. 
From 1947 through 1948, Williams worked to root out corruption in the Internal Revenue Service, exposing the illegal activities of two hundred employees of the Treasury Department. In October 1963, at a time when President Kennedy was pondering the future of his vice president, Lyndon Johnson, Williams exposed corruption in the office of U.S. Senate aide Bobby Baker, Johnson&#x27;s protégé. Williams did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, but voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Williams was the distinctive 67th vote in favor of ending the filibuster of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, leading Mike Mansfield to proclaim &quot;That&#x27;s it!&quot;. In 1967, Williams helped defeat a proposed rule change that would have eliminated the filibuster, a tool that had been of great use to him in exposing government waste and misconduct. In 1968, unable to defeat the tax increase proposed by President Johnson, Williams worked with Democratic U.S. Senator George Smathers of Florida to simultaneously cut federal spending by $60 billion.

Williams, as well as his Senate colleague Prescott Bush of Connecticut, was considered a possible running mate for Republican presidential nominee Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, but removed himself from consideration. He was also considered for a spot on the Republican ticket in 1964 and as a possible replacement for Spiro Agnew when he resigned as vice president of the United States in 1973. Williams was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1948 and 1956.

In 1965, Williams began pressing for a law that would set a mandatory retirement age of 65 for all elected officials. Though mandatory retirement was never enacted, Williams announced in 1969 that he would not seek a fifth term in the U.S. Senate. On December 31, 1970, he resigned from the Senate just before the end of his term, allowing his protégé, newly elected Republican William V. Roth, Jr., to gain additional seniority in his new class of U.S. senators.

In September 1966, Williams assailed the anti-inflation program of the Johnson administration as a &quot;piece-meal approach&quot; to a larger issue and advocated for a five percent across the board tax hike as well as Congress resuming a leadership role on the subject of enacting &quot;necessary remedies to stave off financial collapse that may engulf us&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Williams died in a hospital in Lewes, Delaware and was buried in Millsboro Cemetery, at Millsboro. He was a member of the Methodist Church, the Freemasons, and the Shriners. During his career in the U.S. Senate, Williams was called the &quot;Lonewolf Investigator,&quot; &quot;Watchdog of the Treasury,&quot; &quot;Honest John,&quot; &quot;Mr. Integrity,&quot; and most often, &quot;the Conscience of the Senate.&quot; The section of Delaware Route 24 between Millsboro and Midway is named the John J. Williams Highway in his honor.

==Almanac==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. U.S. Senators are popularly elected and take office January 3 for a six-year term.

<text>Linda Barker (born 26 October 1961) is an English interior designer and television presenter.

==Education==
Born in Shelf, on the outskirts of Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Barker was educated at Bradford Girls&#x27; Grammar School before studying fine art at the Surrey Institute of Art &amp; Design in Farnham, now the University for the Creative Arts. She then did odd jobs in various areas including fashion, before settling into a career as an interior designer. An accomplished painter, she did up her flat in Battersea and was the subject of a &quot;House Beautiful&quot; magazine spread on interiors.

==Career==

Barker began her work in television as a set designer, where she met her husband. She was one of the group of people including Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen approached by the BBC in 1996 to work on a television show called &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; as designers. Barker also started co-presenting &quot;House Invaders&quot; in 1999, and co-presented a three-part special called &quot;Planet Christmas&quot; in 2001. After six years of &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;, restricted by the BBC&#x27;s position on commercial endorsement and disappointed to be overlooked as a replacement presenter to Carol Smillie, she left the show.

Barker launched her more commercially focused career by appearing in the second series of the ITV reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, on which she finished in third place on the final day.

Barker adopted a new personal image, being featured in lads&#x27; magazine shoots and making a yoga DVD. Commercially, she designed and advertised sofas for retailer DFS and cabins for Thomson Holidays. She also brought out her own wallpaper range with Crown. She began presenting series for ITV, including &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot;, &quot;Building the Dream&quot; and a daytime lifestyle series, &quot;Under Construction&quot;.

In 2007 Barker took part in the CBBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Hider in the House&quot;, as the hidden celebrity. Barker also appeared on a celebrity edition of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, aired on 17 September 2008, alongside Peter Stringfellow, Michelle Heaton and Lee Ryan. Linda finished in joint first place with Ryan, both of whom scored 26 points.

In 2009 she joined the design team on the ITV daytime series &quot;60 Minute Makeover&quot;.

In 2013, Barker went on to take part in &quot;Splash!&quot;, ITV&#x27;s celebrity diving show with Olympic diver Tom Daley as her mentor. She finished in third place. Barker, who wore a bikini throughout the series, received widespread admiration for her slim, toned figure and became an ambassador for Playtex shortly after.

In 2017, she presented &quot;The Home Game&quot;, a new daytime series for ITV.

Today Barker writes, publishes design books and writes a column for the weekend &quot;Daily Express&quot; magazine.

In April 2021, Barker launched a collection of fabrics, curtains and blinds with home furnishings retailer Terrys under the brand name &quot;Linda Barker Home&quot;.

==Personal life==
She is married to TV executive Chris Short, and the couple have a daughter and two dogs. The family currently lives between Battersea London and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

<doc id="1276302" wikidata="Q1920228" url="?curid=1276302" title="Menachem Mendel of Kotzk">
<text>Menachem Mendel Morgensztern of [[Kock|Kotzk]] (Kock, Poland), better known as the Kotzker Rebbe and the Kotzker (1787–1859) was a Hasidic rabbi and leader.

==Life==
Born to a non-Hasidic family in Goraj near Lublin, Poland, he became attracted to Hasidic philosophy in his youth. He was known for having acquired impressive Talmudic and Kabbalistic knowledge at an early age. He was a student of Reb Bunim of Peshischa, and upon the latter&#x27;s death attracted many of his followers. Morgensztern was well known for his incisive and down-to-earth philosophies, and sharp-witted sayings. He appears to have had little patience for false piety or stupidity.

From 1839 he lived in seclusion for the last twenty years of his life.

== Students and legacy ==
The Kotzker Rebbe never published any works. He wrote many manuscripts, but he had them all burned before his death. Several collections of his sayings have been published, most notably &quot;Emes VeEmunah&quot; (Truth and Faith).

The Kotzker Rebbe&#x27;s disciple Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, author of &quot;Avnei Nezer&quot; and first Sochatchover Rebbe, was his son-in-law, having married Sara Tzina Morgenstern.

The Kotzker Rebbe is considered to be the spiritual founder upon which the Ger dynasty in Poland is based, through the teachings of its founder and the first Rebbe Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter, known for his work as the &quot;Chidushei Harim&quot;, who was a preeminent disciple of the Kotzker Rebbe and his brother in law through his second wife.

One of his major students was Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbica.

=== Dynasty ===

* His eldest son, Rabbi Dovid Morgensztern, succeeded him as Kotzker Rebbe (1809–1893). His collected works and a genealogy of descendents was published as &quot;Ahavat David&quot; by Boruch Gutter in 2007.
* The third Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi Chaim Yisrael Morgenstern (the Pilover Rebbe, 1840–1905). He wrote Kuntris Shalom Yerusalalayim in 1891, a rare early work of Chassidic Zionism. It was published in &quot;Sheirit Yisrael&quot; 
* A fourth generation Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern (the Sokolover Rebbe, 1866–1939). A leader of Agudat Yisrael in Poland and a Rebbe, Rabbi of a city, an herbalist, and Head of Yeshivat Beit Yisrael. He visited Israel at least twice. His surviving writings were published as &quot;Sheirit Yitschak&quot;. His brother Tzvi Hirsh (the Lukover Rebbe, 1858–1920), was Kotzker Rebbe in Lukov. His surviving writings were republished as &quot;Ateret Tzvi&quot;, with an added genealogy, by the Glenner family of Chicago.
* A fifth Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi Jacob Mendel Morgenstern (the Węgrów Rebbe, 1887–1939). Another was Rabbi Josef Aaron Morgenstern (1891-murdered by Nazis in Treblinka death camp, 1942, the next Lukover Rebbe. He relocated his Chassidic Court to Warsaw before WW2.
* A sixth Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi David Shlomo Morgenstern, who emigrated to London, England and then, Chicago, Illinois where he served the Chicago community. Another was David J Morgan, (born Yisrael Dovid Morgenstern, 1918–1987), author of Truth and Wisdom of Judaism, the only Holocaust surviving son. After WW 2, he lived and taught Chassidic insights and Torah ethics to non-Orthodox Jews in schools in Israel, Belgium, Philadelphia, and Vineland, NJ.
* A seventh generation includes descendants of the first Kotzk-Lukover Rebbe Tzvi Hirsch namely Avraham Meir Morgenstern, Lisa Glenner, Karen Schwartz, and grandchildren of the second Lukov-Kotzk Rebbe, including Dr. Joseph Morgan, founder of KotzkerPhfarma, Rosette Narkunski, and Nancy Recant.
* An eighth and ninth generation includes children and grandchildren of the above.

==Some of the Kotzker&#x27;s sayings==
*&quot;What kind of God would He be if I could understand Him?&quot;
*&quot;If I am I because I am I, and you are you because you are you, then I am I and you are you. But if I am I because you are you and you are you because I am I, then I am not I and you are not you!&quot;
*&quot;Do not be satisfied with the speech of your lips and the thought in your heart, all the promises and good sayings in your mouth, and all the good thoughts in your heart; rather you must arise and do!&quot;
*&quot;A person must renew himself, and his world with him, each and every day. But one who does not do so, and rather performs his deeds as a mechanical function, does nothing other than the actions of a monkey. Just as this monkey has no personality of his own, but rather copies his own actions and his fellow, so too this person.&quot;
*&quot;Not all that is thought need be said, not all that is said need be written, not all that is written need be published, and not all that is published need be read.&quot;
*Man must &quot;guard himself and his uniqueness, and not imitate his fellow ... for initially man was created &#x27;in his own image&#x27;, and only afterwards in the image of God.&quot;
*&quot;People are accustomed to look at the heavens and to wonder what happens there. It would be better if they would look within themselves, to see what happens there.&quot;
*&quot;Where is God to be found? In the place where He is given entry.&quot;
*&quot;You don&#x27;t love fish. If you loved the fish, you would not have killed it and cooked it on a fire.&quot;
*&quot;Just as it is the way of an ape to imitate humans, so too, a person, when he has become old, imitates himself, and does what was his manner previously.&quot; In other words, most of us, at some point in life, either consciously or not, become satisfied with who we are and what we&#x27;ve become. As such, we cease to strive toward attaining greater spiritual heights. We are content to live out our remaining days as a mere imitation of ourselves!

<doc id="1276307" wikidata="Q284917" url="?curid=1276307" title="Voyage of the Damned">
<text>Voyage of the Damned is a 1976 drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, with an all-star cast featuring Faye Dunaway, Oskar Werner, Lee Grant, Max von Sydow, James Mason, Lynne Frederick and Malcolm McDowell.

The story was inspired by actual events concerning the fate of the ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Germany to Cuba in 1939. It was based on a 1974 nonfiction book of the same title written by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts. The screenplay was written by Steve Shagan and David Butler. The film was produced by ITC Entertainment and released by Rank Film Distributors in the UK and Avco Embassy Pictures in the U.S.

==Plot==
Based on historic events, this dramatic film concerns the 1939 voyage of the German-flagged , which departed from Hamburg carrying 937 Jews from Germany, bound for Havana, Cuba. The passengers, having seen and suffered rising anti-Semitism in Germany, realized this might be their only chance to escape. The film details the emotional journey of the passengers, who gradually become aware that their passage was planned as an exercise in Nazi propaganda, and that Germany had never intended that they disembark in Cuba. Rather, they were to be set up as pariahs, to set an example before the world. As a Nazi official states in the film, when the whole world has refused to accept the Jews as refugees, no country can blame Germany for their fate.

The Cuban government refuses entry to the passengers while the ship was on its way, and next the liner heads to the United States. As it waits off the Florida coast, the passengers learn that the United States also has rejected them, as Canada subsequently does, leaving the captain no choice but to return to Europe. The captain tells a confidante that he has received a letter signed by 200 passengers saying they will join hands and jump into the sea rather than return to Germany. He states his intention to run the liner aground on a reef off the southern coast of England, to allow the passengers to be rescued and reach safety there.

Shortly before the film&#x27;s end, it is revealed that the governments of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have each agreed to accept a share of the passengers as refugees. As they cheer and clap at the news, footnotes disclose the fates of some of the main characters, suggesting that more than 600 of the 937 passengers who did not resettle in Britain but in other European nations instead were ultimately deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.

==Production==

The book was published in 1974. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a human document of rare and discerning power&quot;. The book was a best seller, and the authors earned an estimated £500,000 from it.

Rights to the book were acquired in 1974. It was originally envisioned as an ABC Movie of the Week but its budget of $7.3 million was too expensive.

The film was the first feature of Associated General Films.

Dunaway was paid $500,000 plus a percentage of the profits.

The movie was filmed on board the chartered Italian ocean liner &quot;Irpinia&quot;, which was fitted with two false funnels in order to resemble &quot;St. Louis.&quot; It was also shot on location in Barcelona, Spain (standing in for Cuba), St. Pancras Chambers in London, and at the EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.

==Release==
The film opened on 22 December 1976 in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles.

===Box office===
According to Lew Grade who helped finance the film, the movie &quot;should have done better&quot; at the box office. He wrote in his memoirs &quot;I thought it was one of the most moving and important films I&#x27;d seen in a long time. I just couldn&#x27;t understand why it didn&#x27;t become a success&quot; adding that &quot;strangely enough, it did outstanding business in Japan.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==
The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Lalo Schifrin and the soundtrack album was released on the Entr&#x27;Acte label in 1977.

===Personnel===
* Lalo Schifrin - arranger, conductor
* London Studio Orchestra

==Actual death toll==

The true death toll is uncertain. The 1974 book that was the basis of the film estimated a much lower number of deaths. By using statistical analysis of survival rates for Jews in various Nazi-occupied countries, Thomas and Morgan-Witts estimated the fate of the 621 &quot;St. Louis&quot; passengers who were not given refuge in Cuba or the United Kingdom (one died during the voyage): 44 (20%) of the 224 refugees that settled in France likely were murdered in the Holocaust, 62 (29%) Holocaust murders amongst the 214 that reached Belgium, and 121 (67%) Holocaust murders amongst the 181 that settled in the Netherlands, for a total of 227 (37%) of the refugees that came under occupation were likely murdered by the Nazis. In 1998, Scott Miller and Sarah Ogilvie of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum traced the survivors from the voyage, concluding that a total of 254 refugees or 40.9 percent were murdered by the Nazis.

==Alternate version==
An extended version of the film running 182 minutes was broadcast on television and released on home video. Apparently this is an earlier version of the film, which was created by editor Roger Cherrill according to a note in the end credits. 

The extended cut was released on VHS twice: once on NTSC VHS by Magnetic Video in 1980, and once on PAL VHS by Polygram Home Video in the UK. The Polygram cassette is undated and only contains the copyright of the original production, 1976. It also lists the running time as 176 minutes; the difference in run times can be attributed to the differential between PAL and NTSC frame rates.

The extended cut was released as part of a Blu-Ray boxset in Australia from Imprint on September 26, 2024.

<text>The court leet was a historical court baron (a type of manorial court) of England and Wales and Ireland that exercised the &quot;view of frankpledge&quot; and its attendant police jurisdiction, which was normally restricted to the hundred courts.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;leet&quot;, as used in reference to special court proceedings, dates from the late 13th century, from Anglo-French &quot;lete&quot; and Anglo-Latin &quot;leta&quot; of unknown origin, with a possible connection to the verb &quot;&quot;.

==Early history==

At a very early time in medieval England, the lord of the manor exercised or claimed certain feudal rights over his serfs and feudal . The exercise of those rights was combined with manorial administrative concerns, in his court baron. However this court had no power to deal with criminal acts.

Criminal jurisdiction was held by the hundred courts; the country was divided into hundreds, and there was a hundred court for each of them. Each hundred comprised 100 hides, with each hide being an area of land of variable size that is enough to support one entire household. A tithing was an area of 10 hides, which therefore originally corresponded to about 10 households. The heads of each household were judicially bound to the others in their tithing by an arrangement called frankpledge, which created collective responsibility for behaviour within their tithing. The hundred court monitored this system, in a process called &quot;view of frankpledge&quot;, with the tithing reporting any wrongdoing in their area, and handing over the perpetrators among them. If the wrongdoing was minor, it would be dealt with by the hundred court, but serious crimes were passed up to the shire court.

Before feudalism, hundred courts had also dealt with administrative matters within their area, such as bridge repairs, road conditions, and so forth, but the courts baron had largely superseded that in practice, and some manorial lords began claiming authority over criminal matters as well. Eventually, the king formally granted certain trusted lords with the legal authority that had been held by the hundred court over the tithings in the lord&#x27;s manor, the most important of those being &quot;view of frankpledge&quot;. The group of tithings that were located within each manor had come to be called a &quot;leet&quot;, and hence, in the later Middle Ages these judicial powers came to be called court leet.

The &quot;quo warranto&quot; proceedings of Edward I established a sharp distinction between the court baron, exercising strictly manorial rights, and the court leet, exercising the powers formerly held by the hundred court, emphasising that the ability to hold court leet depended upon a royally granted franchise. However, in many areas it became customary for the court baron and court leet to meet together, as a single operation.

==Role==
The court leet was a court of record, and its duty was not only to view the pledges, which were the freemen&#x27;s oaths of peacekeeping and good practice in trade, but also to try with a jury, and punish, crimes committed within the jurisdiction; more serious crimes were committed to the king&#x27;s justices. Despite the presence of a jury, it was not &quot;trial by jury&quot; as understood today. The court leet had developed while the jury system was still evolving; the jury indicted wrongdoers, stood witness, and helped decide on punishment.

It also developed as a means of proactively ensuring that standards in such matters as sales of food and drink, and agriculture, were adhered to. The Alcester Court Leet contained the following wording:

The court generally sat only a few times each year, sometimes just annually. A matter was introduced into the court by means of a &quot;presentment&quot;, from a local man or from the jury itself. Penalties were in the form of fines or imprisonment.

==Jury and officers==
Attendance at the court leet was often compulsory for those under its jurisdiction, with fines being meted out for non-attendance. The ability of the court to levy a fine was always subject to limitations, but the limits were never updated to account for inflation over the centuries; for those courts leet that still exist, the fine has effectively become merely nominal – 2p for example in the case of Laxton.

Courts leet generally had a jury formed from the freehold tenants, as bondsmen could not give an oath (&quot;jury&quot; means persons having taken an oath). The jury&#x27;s role was similar to that of the doomsmen of the Anglo-Saxons and included electing the officers (other than the Steward who was appointed by the lord), bringing matters to the attention of the court and deciding on them.

The officers of courts leet could include some or all of the following:

* Steward, a stand-in for the lord of the manor, and hence his chief official. The steward thus acted as chairman of proceedings – in a comparable manner to a modern-day judge in a jury trial
* Bailiff, the servant of the court. He was responsible for ensuring that the decisions of the court were enacted, including being responsible for summoning the jury, and performing any arrests that had been ordered by the court
* &quot;Reeve&quot;, the bailiff&#x27;s deputy (originally the servant of the hundred court, from which the court leet had taken its jurisdiction)
* Constable, to ensure order during court sessions
* Bedel, the usher; typically referred to as &quot;mace bearer&quot;, in modern-day courts leet, since this is largely all he now does
* Chapelayne, who provided prayers for the court
* Crier or bellman, responsible for announcing of the court&#x27;s decisions to the people of the manor in general
* Affeerers, responsible for assessing amercements (setting the level of fines)
* Specialist professional inspectors, in lieu of portions of the jury&#x27;s responsibility:
** Ale taster or ale conner, to ensure the quality of ale, and to check that true measures are used
** Carniters or &quot;flesh tasters&quot;, to ensure the freshness of meat and poultry
** Bread weighers, responsible for verifying the freshness and weight of bread sold in the manor
** Searcher and sealer of leather, to ensure the quality of leather goods
** Surveyor of the highways or overseer of pavements, and brook looker or ditch reeve, to ensure the proper condition of roads and waterways
** Chimney peeper, to ensure chimneys were swept clean
** Scavenger, to ensure standards of hygiene within the lanes and privies and to try and prevent the spread of infectious disease
** Overseer of the poor, to collect and distribute alms
* Specialist enacting staff, in lieu of parts of the bailiff&#x27;s responsibility
** The Hayward, responsible for s and fences on common land
** The Woodward, responsible for patrolling woodlands and stopping poachers from hunting illegally
** The Pinherd, to impound stray animals in the pinfold

==Later history==
The introduction of magistrates gradually rebalanced power away from manorial lords. Magistrates were later given authority over &quot;view of frankpledge&quot;, which effectively negated the remaining significance of the court leet, and they gradually ceased to be held, largely dying out. Following the collapse of the feudal system, and subsequent rise of the Reformation, civil parishes had largely taken over the remaining authority of courts baron, and tithings were seen as a parish sub-division.

Nevertheless, courts leet technically survived into the late 20th century, though almost all of the small number which still operated had become merely ceremonial, simply forming a way of promoting or celebrating their local area. Despite this, their legal jurisdiction over crime was only abolished in 1977, by section 23 of the Administration of Justice Act 1977. However, one exception was allowed: the court leet for the manor of Laxton, Nottinghamshire, which had continued to operate judicially; Laxton retains the open-field system of farming, which had been replaced everywhere else by the 18th century (as a result of the process of enclosure), and required the court in order to administer the field system.

Although the Administration of Justice Act had abolished the legal jurisdiction of the other courts leet, it emphasised that &quot;any such court may continue to sit and transact such other business, if any, as was customary for it&quot;. Schedule 4 to the Act specified the &quot;business&quot; which was to be considered customary, which included the taking of presentments relating to matters of local concern and – in some cases – the management of common land.

===Surviving jurisdictions ===

The following courts leet were exempted from abolition by the Administration of Justice Act 1977, and were known to be still functioning in 2010:

* Holsworthy, Devon
* Laugharne
* Court Leet of Northleach, Gloucestershire

<doc id="1276320" wikidata="Q3888063" url="?curid=1276320" title="Proper transfer function">
<text>In control theory, a proper transfer function is a transfer function in which the degree of the numerator does not exceed the degree of the denominator. A strictly proper transfer function is a transfer function where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.

The difference between the degree of the denominator (number of poles) and degree of the numerator (number of zeros) is the &quot;relative degree&quot; of the transfer function.

==Example==
The following transfer function:
:formula_1

is proper, because
:formula_2.

is biproper, because
:formula_3.

but is not strictly proper, because
:formula_4.

The following transfer function is not proper (or strictly proper)
:formula_5
because
:formula_6.

A not proper transfer function can be made proper by using the method of long division.

The following transfer function is strictly proper
:formula_7
because
:formula_8.

==Implications==
A proper transfer function will never grow unbounded as the frequency approaches infinity:
:formula_9

A strictly proper transfer function will approach zero as the frequency approaches infinity (which is true for all physical processes):
:formula_10

Also, the integral of the real part of a strictly proper transfer function is zero.

<text>Pedro Solbes Mira (31 August 1942 – 18 March 2023) was a Spanish economist. He was the president of FRIDE, Madrid-based think tank.

==Life and career==
Solbes was born in Pinoso on 31 August 1942.

While independent in the sense of not being affiliated to any party, his various ministerial roles in Spain were always within Socialist Workers&#x27; Party cabinets. 

From 1985 to 1991, he was third 3rd secretary of state for the European Communities. He was agriculture and fisheries minister (1991–1993) and finance minister (1993–1996) in Felipe González&#x27;s cabinets, also MP representing Alicante for the same party until 1999.

Appointed by Spanish premier José María Aznar (of the main competing party, the People&#x27;s Party), Solbes was a European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs in the European Commission presided over by Romano Prodi (the Prodi Commission).

Then Solbes served as second vice president and minister of economy and finance in the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, which he held from 2004 to 2009.

Solbes died from cancer on 18 March 2023, at the age of 80.

<doc id="1276337" wikidata="Q416745" url="?curid=1276337" title="Androstenone">
<text>Androstenone (5α-androst-16-en-3-one) is a 16-androstene class steroidal pheromone. It is found in boar&#x27;s saliva, celery cytoplasm, and truffle fungus. Androstenone was the first mammalian pheromone to be identified. It is found in high concentrations in the saliva of male pigs, and, when inhaled by a female pig that is in heat, results in the female assuming the mating stance. Androstenone is the active ingredient in &#x27;Boarmate&#x27;, a commercial product made by DuPont sold to pig farmers to test sows for timing of artificial insemination.

==Biosynthesis==
Androstenone is synthesized from androstadienone by 5α-reductase, and can be converted into 3α-androstenol or 3β-androstenol by 3-ketosteroid reductase.

==Properties==
Depending upon the subject, androstenone can have an unpleasant, sweaty, urinous smell, a woody smell, or even a pleasant floral smell.

There are two different genotypes that allow an individual to smell androstenone. The first genotype, which consists of two fully functional copies of the gene, is the RT/RT allele, and the second is the RT/WM allele. The OR7D4 receptor has two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, which cause the gene to have two amino acid substitutions, which in turn cause the receptor to act differently. Those in possession of the two proper genes, (RT/RT) for OR7D4 tend to describe the odor for the steroid as the odor of stale urine. Those with only one gene (RT/WM) typically described the odor as weak or were not able to detect it. They can also find the smell &#x27;pleasant&#x27;, &#x27;sweet&#x27; or &#x27;similar to vanilla&#x27;.

In small amounts, the odor is hardly detectable by most people. This may be due to a polymorphism in the receptor gene that codes for the androstenone receptor. However, the ability to detect the odor varies greatly. It has been shown that the odor can be detected by people down to levels of 0.2 parts per billion to 0.2 parts in 100 million. Several groups report, however, that some individuals who initially cannot smell androstenone can learn to smell it by repeated exposures to it.

===Detectability as a pheromone===
In humans, androstenone also has been suggested to be a pheromone; however, there is little scientific data to support this claim. The vomeronasal organ is an auxiliary olfactory sense organ responsible for the detection of pheromones as more than just an odor. Most adult humans possess something resembling this organ, but there is no active function. Humans lack the sensory cells that exist in other mammals needed to detect pheromones beyond a smell. Humans also lack the genetic ability to produce these sensory cells actively.

There is also a specific anosmia to the odor in some humans; they are unable to smell specific odors, but have, otherwise, a normal sense of smell. However, this should, by no means, be regarded as indicative for being labeled as a pheromone, as it is true of over 80 olfactory compounds.

To animals, the smell of androstenone can act as a social sign of dominance and can be a way of attracting a mate.

===Commercial use===
Some commercially available products are advertised using claims that they contain human sexual pheromones, including androstenone, and that they can act as an aphrodisiac.

<doc id="1276346" wikidata="Q352302" url="?curid=1276346" title="Miguel Ángel Moratinos">
<text>Miguel Ángel Moratinos Cuyaubé (born 8 June 1951) is a Spanish diplomat and politician, a member of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party and was a member of Congress from 2004 to 2011, where he represented Córdoba. From 2004 to 2010, he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain. In 2018, he was appointed as United Nations Under-Secretary-General holding the position of High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations and assumed the position on 7 January 2019.

==Education==
Born in 1951, Moratinos graduated in Law and Political Sciences at the University Complutense in Madrid, and then in Diplomatic Studies at the Diplomatic School of Spain.

==Political career==
Working with Javier Solana, who was then Spanish foreign minister, Moratinos helped prepare the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue launched in November 1995 in Barcelona.

===EU Special Representative===
Between 1996 and 2003, Moratinos was the European Union Special Representative for the Middle East, based in Cyprus and Brussels. In this capacity, he attended most meetings of EU foreign ministers. During his time in office, the European Union – which had already been the biggest financial contributor to the region – also became increasingly vocal about Israeli-Palestinian relations.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===
Moratinos served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero from 18 April 2004 until 21 October 2010, when he was replaced by Trinidad Jiménez.

By the end of 2009, Moratinos was mentioned by news media as a potential candidate for the position of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy; the post later went to Catherine Ashton instead.

Relations with Gibraltar

In September 2006, Moratinos joined UK Minister for Europe Geoff Hoon and Gibraltar&#x27;s Chief Minister Peter Caruana in signing the Cordoba Agreement, an agreement to establish a Tripartite forum for co-operation on Gibraltar. As part of the agreement, he attended talks in Gibraltar in July 2009, making him the first Spanish minister to ever make an official visit to the British Overseas Territory.

Transatlantic relations

In September 2006, Moratinos became the first government official to appear before the European Parliament&#x27;s committee investigating CIA activity in Europe.

In 2009, Moratinos sent a confidential note to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warning that Spanish public opinion could turn anti-American if Spain disclosed a study on contamination caused by the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash, according to a note contained in the WikiLeaks documents and published at the time by the newspaper &quot;El País&quot;.

In 2010, Moratinos announced that Spain was willing to take in five inmates from the American military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
OSCE chairmanship

In his capacity as minister, Moratinos was the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 2007. On 17 August 2007, he appointed Croatian diplomat and ex-minister Miomir Žužul, &quot;to be his personal representative in a mission to Georgia on (a) missile incident that took place on 6 August,&quot; alleged to be a Russian missile strike on Georgian territory.

Relations with Latin America

Following the Bolivian general election in December 2005, Moratinos summoned the Vatican&#x27;s envoy to Spain after a comedian for conservative radio station Cadena COPE held a five-minute telephone conversation with the newly elected president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, while claiming to be the Spanish prime minister.

In October 2006, Moratinos announced that EADS CASA, a division of the European defense company EADS, had decided to cancel a deal on selling 12 military transport planes to Venezuela because American government objections made it unfeasible.

In 2007, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized Spain for not doing more to support dissidents in communist Cuba, after Moratinos chose not to meet with Cuban dissidents during a visit to the United States in April 2007. In 2010, he took part in the tripartite negotiations with Cuban President Raúl Castro and Roman Catholic bishop Jaime Ortega that resulted in pardons being granted to 52 Black Spring prisoners on the condition that they go into exile in Spain.

In late 2009, Moratinos was at the forefront of efforts to reinstate ousted President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras.

==Later career==

In 2010, Moratinos was given a new mission as a special envoy trying to defuse a row between Israel and Egypt that threatened to derail, for the second time, a summit of the Union for the Mediterranean.

Since 2011, Moratinos has been teaching at Sciences Po Paris. Also in 2011, he was nominated by the Spanish government as a candidate for the position of director general of FAO; as part of his election campaign, he visited 90 countries. However, on June 26 he lost to Brazilian José Graziano da Silva. He received 88 votes out of 180 cast in the second round, while Graziano da Silva won 92.

In mid-2012, Moratinos was among the candidates at the United Nations for a possible replacement of Kofi Annan as UN-Arab League Joint Special Envoy for Syria.

From 2012 to 2013, Moratinos was a member of the High-Level Advisory Council of the President of the 67th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Serbia&#x27;s then foreign minister Vuk Jeremić.

Following consultations, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Moratinos as his High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations in 2018, succeeding Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.

==Other activities==
In addition, Moratinos has held various paid and unpaid positions, including:
* Bahrain Center for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (DERASAT), member of the international advisory board
* British University in Egypt, member of the board of trustees
* Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development (CIRSD), member of the board of advisors

<doc id="1276354" wikidata="Q12407870" url="?curid=1276354" title="Joshua Falk">
<text>Yehoshua ben Alexander HaCohen Falk (1555 – 29 March 1614) was a Polish Halakhist and Talmudist, best known as the author of the &quot;Drisha&quot; and &quot;Prisha&quot; commentaries on the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; as well as &quot;Sefer Me&#x27;irat Enayim&quot; (סמ&quot;ע) on &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;. His name also occurs as the Hebrew acronyms רפ&quot;כ (&quot;RaFaC&quot;) (&quot;Rabbi Falk Cohen&quot;), מהרו&quot;כ (&quot;Ma-HaRWaC&quot;) (&quot;Morenu ha-Rav Walk Cohen&quot;), and מהר&quot;י כ&quot;ץ (MaHaRY KTz &quot;Morenu ha-Rav Joshua Katz).&quot;

== Biography ==
He was a pupil of his relative Moses Isserles and of Solomon Luria, and became the head of the yeshiva of Lemberg. Many celebrated rabbis were his pupils, among them being Joshua Höschel ben Joseph of Kraków, the author of &quot;Maginei Shlomo&quot;.
Falk was a great authority on rabbinical matters. At the meeting of the Council of Four Lands in 1607, during the Kremenetz fair, many of his proposals were approved.

In 1611 Falk and Enoch Hendel ben Shemariah issued a bill of divorce at Vienna which occasioned lengthy discussions among the celebrated rabbis of the time, including Meir Lublin and Mordecai Yoffe.
He was Rosh Yeshiva in Lemberg and served on the Council of Four Lands.

Falk was opposed to the reliance on law codes to the exclusion of study of the original sources. Towards this end he composed a series of commentaries on the most influential codes, Rabbi Jacob ben Asher&#x27;s &quot;Tur&quot; and Rabbi Joseph Karo&#x27;s &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;. He spent his early life composing extensive analytical commentaries on the Talmud, which were later lost in a fire.

Falk died at Lemberg, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on 29 March 1614.

=== Note on the name &quot;Joshua Falk&quot; ===
Until the early 19th century, the names of most Central European Jews consisted of a Hebrew first name, a German second name, the patronymic &quot;ben ... &quot; (son of ...) and, if an upper one, the class - HaCohen (or &quot;Katz&quot;) or HaLevy. The German name was chosen to fit the Hebrew one: thus &quot;Zvi&quot; or &quot;Naftali&quot; went with &quot;Hirsch&quot;, and &quot;Zev&quot; or &quot;Binjamin&quot; with &quot;Wolf&quot;. Those whose given name was Yehoshua, Josua, or Joshua had the second name of Falk, Valk, Walk, Wallik or Wallich. (One theory is that &quot;Falk&quot;, here, derives from the German for falcon: just as a falcon circles its prey, so Joshua circled and explored the Holy Land before swooping down on it. Some derive &quot;Valk&quot; from an acronym of Leviticus 19:18: &quot;ve&#x27;ahavta lere&#x27;akha kamokha&quot; - &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself&quot;). The name Falk was thus not a family name until the 19th century, when it was adopted by those whose immediate ancestors had &quot;Falk&quot; as a second name. Encyclopedias will therefore have several entries under &quot;Falk&quot;, where &quot;Falk&quot;, strictly, is not a surname. References to Rabbi Falk are therefore often via &quot;Yehoshua Falk ben Alexander HaCohen&quot; or &quot;Joshua Falk ben Alexander Katz&quot; or &quot;Joshua Falk Katz&quot;.

== Works ==
&quot;Beit Yisrael&quot; is a twin commentary on the &quot;Tur&quot;, composed of the Perishah, a straightforward explanation, and the Derishah, deeper discussions on specific problems. The &quot;Perishah&quot; clarifies the rulings of the &quot;Tur&quot;, by tracing them to their sources in the Talmud and &quot;Rishonim&quot;. The &quot;Derishah &quot;is devoted to extensive analysis and comparison of the various interpretations and decisions proposed by various Talmudic authorities.

Rabbi Falk also wrote:
* &quot;Sefer Me&#x27;irat Einayim&quot;, a commentary to the &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; section of the &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot;, containing all the decisions of the &quot;Rishonim&quot;, with an index of their sources.
* &quot;Sefer ha-Hosafah&quot;, a supplement to the &quot;Darhkei Mosheh&quot; of Moses Isserles, printed with the &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot;, Dyhernfurth, 1796;
* &quot;Kontres &#x27;al Diney Ribbit&quot;, a discourse on the laws relating to the prohibition of usury, followed by some &quot;takkanot&quot; (ordinances by the Rabbis), Sulzbach, 1692;
* Novellae on Talmudic treatises.

<text>The [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYCRR) was formed on December 22, 1914, as a consolidation of the companies listed below. It later merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central.

The NYCRR owned stock in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad and the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, but sold it in July 1917 and April 1922, respectively.

==Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad==
Also known as the Mohawk and Malone Railway, the Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad was built by Dr. William Seward Webb. The line crossed the northern Adirondacks at Tupper Lake Junction, just north of Tupper Lake. Webb began by purchasing the narrow gauge Herkimer, Newport and Poland Railroad, which ran 16 miles from Herkimer to Poland. He then had track built from Tupper Lake to Moira and thence to Montreal. This was variously called the Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad and the Mohawk and Malone Railway. It opened in 1892 from Malone Junction to Childwold Station with a branch from Lake Clear Junction to Saranac Lake. After 1893, it was controlled by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, and in 1913, it merged with the Central as the &quot;Adirondack Division&quot;.

==Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad (original)==
Chartered in 1855, the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad (DM&amp;T) ran from Detroit, Michigan, south-southwest along the shore of Lake Erie to Monroe, Michigan. It crossed the state line into Ohio, where it ran into Toledo, Ohio. The line was completed on December 25, 1856. The DM&amp;T leased itself in perpetuity to the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad (MS&amp;NI) on July 1, 1856. The MS&amp;NI merged with the Lake Shore Railway in 1869 to form the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&amp;MS). The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad achieved a controlling interest in the LS&amp;MS in 1877, and the two companies merged in 1914 to form the New York Central Railroad. The DM&amp;T&#x27;s assets were merged into the NYC on January 1, 1915.

<doc id="1276360" wikidata="Q585905" url="?curid=1276360" title="Antoine Court de Gébelin">
<text>Antoine Court, who named himself Antoine Court de Gébelin (Nîmes, 25 January 1725Paris, 10 May 1784), was a Protestant pastor, born in Nîmes, who initiated the interpretation of the Tarot as an arcane repository of timeless esoteric wisdom in 1781.

The &quot;New International Encyclopedia&quot; of 1914 reports that Court de Gébelin, who adopted the surname of his grandmother, was a literary man of recognized rank, and rendered excellent service, first as his father&#x27;s amanuensis and assistant and afterward as a scholar at the capital. He is remembered in connection with the case of Jean Calas, by his work &quot;Les Toulousaines, ou lettres historiques et apologétiques en faveur de la religion réformée&quot; (Lausanne, 1763).

==Early life==
His father was Antoine Court, a famous religious leader of the Huguenots. Court de Gébelin had been ordained a pastor in 1754 before departing Switzerland and remained openly Protestant, a rational advocate for freedom of conscience in Enlightenment France. In Paris, he was initiated into Freemasonry at the lodge Les Amis Réunis, in 1771, and moved on to the lodge Les Neuf Sœurs where he welcomed Benjamin Franklin as a lodge-brother.

==Career==
He was a supporter of American Independence who contributed to the massive &quot;Affaires de l&#x27;Angleterre et de l&#x27;Amérique&quot;, of the new theories of economics, and of the &quot;animal magnetism&quot; of Mesmer. 

In a letter from the Reverend James Madison to James Madison dated 15 June 1782 he is spoken of with the words, &quot;Mr. Gibelin of Paris, who is said tho’ to have a very great Reputation.&quot; 

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781. In 1783, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

His great project had for its goal to set out to reconstruct the high primeval civilization. Reinterpreting Classical and Renaissance evocation of the Golden Age in mankind&#x27;s early history, Court de Gébelin asserted that the primitive worldwide civilization had been advanced and enlightened. He is the intellectual grandfather of much of modern occultism. His centers of focus are the familiar ones of universal origins of languages in deep time and the hermeneutics of symbolism. While his views on hermeneutics and religious matters were largely conservative, his original ideas and research on the origin of language earn him a place among pioneers of linguistics. Court de Gébelin presented dictionaries of etymology, what he called a universal grammar, and discourses on the origins of language. His volumes were so popular he republished them separately, as &quot;Histoire naturelle de la parole, ou Précis de l&#x27;Origine du Langage &amp; de la Grammaire Universelle&quot; (&quot;Natural History of Speech, or a Treatise on the Origins of Language and of Universal Grammar&quot;), in Paris, 1776.

With regard to mythology and symbology, he discussed the origins of allegory in antiquity and recreated a history of the calendar from civil, religious, and mythological perspectives.

==The tarot==
De Gébelin wrote an essay included in his &quot;Le Monde primitif, analysé et comparé avec le monde moderne&quot; (&quot;The Primeval World, Analyzed and Compared to the Modern World&quot;), volume viii, 1781. The chapter on Tarot with which his name is indelibly associated is a single section in his vast compendium that he published in series from 1773, to a distinguished list of subscribers, headed by Louis XVI of France.

It was his immediate perception, the first time he saw the Tarot deck, that it held the secrets of the Egyptians. Writing without the benefit of Champollion&#x27;s deciphering of the Egyptian language, Court de Gébelin developed a reconstruction of Tarot history, without producing any historical evidence, which was that Egyptian priests had distilled the ancient &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; into these images. These they brought to Rome, where they were secretly known to the popes, who brought them to Avignon in the 14th century, whence they were introduced into France. An essay by the Comte de Mellet included in Court de Gebelin&#x27;s &quot;Monde primitif&quot; is responsible for the mystical connection of the Tarot&#x27;s 21 trumps and the fool with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. An essay appended to this gave suggestions for cartomancy; within two years the fortune-teller known as &quot;Etteilla&quot; published a technique for reading the tarot, and the practice of tarot reading was born.

<text>The Brück aerial testing facility is a facility for testing aerials at Brück, south of Berlin. It was established in 1939.

==Overview==
On the Brück aerial testing facility there are two wood-framework towers built in 1963, made without any metallic parts and used for mounting aerials to measure their characteristics. One of these towers, the Messturm III, consists of two towers connected by a bridge on top, while the other, the Messturm II, is from conventional design.

A third wood tower, the former Messturm I, which was built in 1958, was destroyed in a fire in 1979.

<doc id="1276374" wikidata="Q2956421" url="?curid=1276374" title="Fretwork">
<text>Fretwork is an interlaced decorative design that is either carved in low relief on a solid background, or cut out with a fretsaw, coping saw, jigsaw or scroll saw. Most fretwork patterns are geometric in design. The materials most commonly used are wood and metal. Fretwork is used to adorn furniture and musical instruments. The term is also used for tracery on glazed windows and doors. Fretwork is also used to adorn/decorate architecture, where specific elements of decor are named according to their use such as eave bracket, gable fretwork or baluster fretwork, which may be of metal, especially cast iron or aluminum. Installing elaborate wooden fretworks on residential buildings, known as gingerbread trims, became popular in North America in the late 19th century.

Fretwork patterns originally were ornamental designs used to decorate objects with a grid or a lattice. Designs have developed from the rectangular wave Greek fret to intricate intertwined patterns. A common misconception is that fretwork must be done with a fretsaw. However, a fretwork pattern is considered a fretwork regardless of whether it was cut out with a fretsaw.

Computer numerical control (CNC) has brought about change in the method of timber fretwork manufacture. Lasers or router/milling cutting implements can now fashion timber and various other materials into flat and even 3D decorative items.

Fretwork is often used in Squeezebox type instruments to allow air to pass in and out of the instrument while shielding the action board.

<doc id="1276376" wikidata="Q1188845" url="?curid=1276376" title="Yamada Nagamasa">
<text>was a Japanese adventurer who gained considerable influence in the Ayutthaya Kingdom at the beginning of the 17th century and became the governor of Nakhon Si Thammarat province, which is on the Malay Peninsula in present-day Southern Thailand.

From 1617 until his death in 1630, Yamada Nagamasa was head of the Thai village referred to as Ban Yipun (&#x27;Japanese village&#x27;) in the Thai language. This village was within the city of Ayutthaya (the capital city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom). &quot;Ban Yipun&quot; was home to roughly 1,000 Japanese citizens and was headed by a Japanese chief who was nominated by Ayutthayan authorities. Its inhabitants were a combination of traders, Christian converts who had fled their home country following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu and Rōnin (unemployed former samurai) who had been on the losing side at the Battle of Sekigahara (1600) or the Siege of Osaka (1614–15). The Christian community seems to have been in the hundreds, as described by Padre António Francisco Cardim, who recounted having administered sacraments to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the city of Ayutthaya.

==Early life==
Yamada Nagamasa was born in Numazu, Shizuoka in 1590. He is said to have been a palanquin bearer for the lord of Numazu. He became involved in Japanese trade activities with Southeast Asia during the period of the red seal ships and settled in the Ayutthaya Kingdom (modern-day Thailand) around 1612.

==Career==
Yamada Nagamasa is alleged to have carried on the business of a privateer from the period of 1620, attacking and plundering Dutch ships in and around Batavia (present-day Jakarta). Stories of Yamada burying his treasure on the east coast of Australia (and in particular, Magnetic Island off Townsville) persist but it is highly unlikely that Yamada would have ventured into that area as there were no trade routes in this region and the only ships to venture to this region were the ones blown off course during the summer storms. Furthermore, Yamada would have passed thousands of islands in the Torres Strait and Coral Sea and these would have provided safekeeping for any treasure and avoided a very long recovery voyage in the future.

The &quot;Ban Yipun&quot; colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer hide to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and handicrafts (Japanese swords, Japanese lacquerware, high-quality papers). The Japanese were noted by the Dutch for challenging the trade monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (&quot;Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie&quot;). The colony also had an important military role in the Ayutthaya Kingdom.

==Military involvement and lordship==
The Japanese colony was highly valued for its military expertise, and was organized under a &quot;Department of Japanese Volunteers&quot; (&quot;Krom Asa Yipun&quot;) by the King of Ayutthaya.

In the space of 15 years, Yamada Nagamasa rose from the low Thai nobility rank of &quot;Khun&quot; to the senior of &quot;Ok-ya&quot;, his title becoming &quot;Ok-ya Senaphimuk (Thai : ออกญาเสนาภิมุข)&quot;. He became the head of the Japanese colony, and in this position supported the military campaigns of King Songtham, at the head of a Japanese army flying the Japanese flag. He fought successfully, and was finally nominated Ligor (modern Nakhon Si Thammarat), in the southern peninsula in 1630, accompanied by 300 samurai.

==Travels between Siam and Japan==
After more than 12 years in Siam, Yamada Nagamasa went to Japan in 1624 on board one of his ships, where he sold a cargo of Siamese deer hide in Nagasaki. He stayed in Japan for three years, trying to obtain a Red Seal permit, but finally left in 1627, with the simple status of a foreign ship.

In 1626, Nagamasa offered a painting of one of his warship to a temple of his hometown in Shizuoka. That painting was lost in a fire, but a copy of it remains to this day. It portrays a ship with Western-style rigging, 18 cannons, and sailors in samurai gear. He returned to Siam in 1627.

In 1628, one of his ships transporting rice from Ayutthaya to Malacca was arrested by a Dutch warship blockading the city. The ship was released once the identity of the owner became clear, since the Dutch knew that Yamada was held in great respect by the King of Siam, and they did not wish to enter into a diplomatic conflict. Yamada was also valued by the Dutch as a supplier of deer hide, and they invited him to trade more with Batavia.

==Death==
In 1629, Yamada Nagamasa visited Japan with a delegation from King Songtham.

He soon travelled back to Siam, but became involved in a succession war following the death of the King Songtham by Prasat Thong. Prasat Thong had acted as &quot;king-maker&quot; before assuming the throne, by performing the double regicide of King Songtham&#x27;s sons. Yamada or Okya Seniphimok, heard of the coup at Ayutthaya and rebelled. Prasat Thong had Praya Chaiya poison him in 1630, and then expelled the remaining Japanese.

==End of relations between Siam and Japan==
Following Yamada&#x27;s death in 1630, the new ruler and usurper king of Siam Prasat Thong (1630–1655) sent an army of 4,000 soldiers to destroy the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya, but many Japanese managed to flee to the Khmer Kingdom. A few years later in 1633, returnees (300–400 Japanese) from Indochina were able to re-establish the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya.

From 1634, the &quot;shōgun&quot;, informed of these troubles and what he perceived as attacks on his authority, refused to issue further Red Seal ship permits for Siam.

Desirous to renew trade, however, the king of Siam sent a trading ship and an embassy to Japan in 1636, but the embassies were rejected by the shogun, thus putting an end to direct relations between Japan and Siam. Japan was concomitantly closing itself to the world at that time, a period known as Sakoku.

The Dutch took advantage of the Japanese withdrawal, increasing their trade and offering naval support. Japan lost influence for 300 years after being expelled by Prasat Thong.

==Memorial==
Yamada now rests in his hometown in the area of Otani. The remnants of the Japanese quarters in Ayutthuya are still visible to visitors, as well as a statue of Yamada in Siamese military uniform.

<doc id="1276398" wikidata="Q1994329" url="?curid=1276398" title="Achyuta">
<text>In Hinduism, Achyuta (, ) is an epithet of Vishnu and appears as the 100th and 318th names in the Vishnu Sahasranama. It is also often used in the Bhagavad Gita as a personal name of Krishna. According to Adi Shankara&#x27;s commentary on the 1000 Names of Vishnu, Achyuta means &quot;one who will never lose his inherent nature and powers&quot;. The name also means &quot;immovable&quot;, &quot;unchangeable&quot;, and as such is used for &quot;the one who is without the six transformations, beginning with birth&quot;.

==Literature==

*&quot;Arjuna said: O infallible one (Achyuta), please draw up my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here desiring to fight, and know with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms.&quot; (Bhagavad Gita Chapter 1, verses 21-22)
*Arjuna speaking: &quot;&quot;Thinking of You as my friend, I have rashly addressed You &quot;O Krishna&quot;, &quot;O Yadava&quot;, &quot;O my friend&quot;, not knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonoured You many times, jesting as we relaxed, lay on the same bed, or sat or ate together, sometimes alone and sometimes in front of many friends. O infallible one (Acyuta), please excuse me for all those offences.&quot;&quot; (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 11, verses 41-42)
*Arjuna speaking:&quot; &quot;Destroyed is my delusion, as I have gained my memory (knowledge) through your grace, O Achyuta. I stand firm with my doubts dispelled. I shall act according to your word.&quot;&quot; (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, verse 73)

<doc id="1276399" wikidata="Q7489466" url="?curid=1276399" title="Shardeloes">
<text>Shardeloes is a large 18th-century country house located one mile west of Amersham in Buckinghamshire, England (). A previous manor house on the site was demolished and the present building constructed between 1758 and 1766 for William Drake, the Member of Parliament for Amersham. Shardeloes is a Grade I listed building.

==Design and construction==
The architect and builder was Stiff Leadbetter; designs for interior decorations were provided by Robert Adam from 1761. Built in the Palladian style, of stuccoed brick, the mansion is nine bays long by seven bays deep. It was constructed with the piano nobile on the ground floor and a mezzanine above. The north facade has a large portico of Corinthian columns. The terminating windows of the piano nobile are pedimented and recessed into shallow niches, as are the end bays of the east front. The roof, typically for the palladian style, is hidden by a balustrade. The original plans of the house by Leadbetter show a design closer in appearance to Holkham Hall, with square end towers. Adam cancelled this idea, but embellished the front with the portico.

The interior of the house has fine ornamental plaster work by Joseph Rose. The entrance hall by Adam has fluted Doric pilasters and massive doorcases in the north and south walls. The dining room has stucco panels and an oval panel in the ceiling. The library was designed by James Wyatt in a classical style and has painted panels by Biagio Rebecca. Nikolaus Pevsner describes the staircase as &quot;surprisingly small.&quot; Pevsner, for once, rather misses the point: as the house was designed, all rooms of importance, including the bedrooms, were on the principal ground floor; thus, there was no need for a grand staircase, as no grandee would ever need to ascend to the secondary floor above. Blenheim Palace is another house with a small staircase for the same reason.

The house is flanked to the west by a service block and stable yard of the same period as the mansion, complete with clock tower. The stable yard is entered through five archways; the rectangular building has projecting wings and a pitched roof.

==Grounds==
Humphry Repton was commissioned to lay out the grounds in the classical English landscape fashion, in the lee of the hill upon which the mansion stands. Repton dammed the River Misbourne to form a lake.

===Cricket ground===
The grounds house a cricket ground, which is the home ground of Amersham Cricket Club, which has played at the ground in two periods from 1856 to 1886 and from 1905 to present. The ground has been used for minor counties matches by Buckinghamshire in both the Minor Counties Championship and the Minor Counties Twenty20. Buckinghamshire also played one List A one-day match when there when they were permitted to play List A cricket, playing against first-class opposition in the form of Glamorgan in the 1972 Gillette Cup. A combined Minor Counties South team also played five List A matches there in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup between 1973 and 1977.

==Recent history==
The mansion remained the ancestral home of the Tyrwhitt-Drake family until the Second World War, when the house was requisitioned as a maternity hospital for evacuated pregnant women from London; some three thousand children were born there, including lyricist Sir Tim Rice in 1944. Following the war the house seemed destined to become one of the thousands of country houses being demolished, until a local conservation society, the Amersham Society, assisted by the Council for the Protection of Rural England fought a prolonged battle to save the house: eventually a preservation order was put on the building preventing its demolition. Although inhabited in parts, the building fell into a state of neglect through the 1960s and was eventually purchased in the early 1970s by local property developer Richard Watson. His company, Landstone Limited, completed a comprehensive renovation of the building and converted unused parts into further apartments. Shardeloes today is a complex of private flats; the principal reception rooms are preserved as common rooms for the residents.

<text>D0226 and D0227 were two prototype diesel shunting locomotives built in 1956 by English Electric at its Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. They originally carried numbers D226 and D227, their Vulcan Foundry works numbers, but these were amended in August 1959 to avoid clashing with the numbers of new Class 40 locomotives.

They were both of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement and were fitted with English Electric 6RKT engines of 500 hp. They were painted black with an orange stripe along the middle of the bodyside, which turned into a &#x27;V&#x27; at the nose end. The major difference between the two locomotives was that D0226 had diesel-electric transmission and D0227 had diesel-hydraulic transmission.

BR tested both locomotives at its Stratford depot in East London. D0226 has been preserved at the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, but D0227 was scrapped.

<doc id="1276404" wikidata="Q7586408" url="?curid=1276404" title="Sriman">
<text>Sriman () is an epithet of the Hindu deity Vishnu. It refers to the deity being the possessor of Sri, both referring to his consort Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, as well as the material and non-material aspects of fortune.

It is more generally used in the form of an honorific, as a prefix for male names. 

== Literature ==
Sriman is a name of Vishnu, and appears as the 22nd, 178th, and the 220th names in the Vishnu Sahasranama.

According to Adi Shankara&#x27;s commentary on the Vishnu Sahasranama, Sriman means &quot;One on whose chest Sri or Lakshmi, mother of the world, always dwells.&quot;

Sriman is often used to invoke Vishnu in the mantras of Vedanta Desika.

<doc id="1276405" wikidata="Q1499419" url="?curid=1276405" title="Listen with Mother">
<text>Listen with Mother was a BBC radio programme for children which ran between 16 January 1950 and 10 September 1982. It was originally produced by Freda Lingstrom although for the majority of its run it was produced by George Dixon, and was presented over the years by Daphne Oxenford, Julia Lang, Eileen Browne, Dorothy Smith and others.

==History==
It was first broadcast on 16 January 1950 on the BBC Light Programme in a fifteen-minute slot every weekday afternoon at 1.45, just before &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. Consisting of stories, songs and nursery rhymes (often sung by Eileen Browne and George Dixon) for &quot;mothers and children at home&quot;, it had at its peak an audience of more than a million listeners. Roger Fiske assisted with the music. From 7 September 1964 the programme moved to the BBC Home Service (later BBC Radio 4).

The final week of programmes (widely reported in the press) featured Wriggly Worm stories, presented by Nerys Hughes and Tony Aitken and directed by David Bell. These stories were broadcast on the &quot;Listen with Mother&quot; throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.

&quot;Listening Corner&quot;, which replaced &quot;Listen with Mother&quot; on 13 September 1982, began with repeats of the Wriggly Worm stories. Collections of &quot;Listen with Mother&quot; stories have been published by Hutchinsons/Random House. Two collections of Wriggly Worm stories (&#x27;Wonderful Wriggly Worm&#x27; and &#x27;Wonderful Wriggly Worm Rides Again&#x27;), by Eugenie Summerfield, have been published by Book Guild. &quot;Listening Corner&quot; continued until 24 August 1990, ending three days before the launch of BBC Radio 5, which became the new home of children&#x27;s radio programmes.

==Theme music==
At the start of each programme a short introduction on piano was played. The tune went to the rhythm of the words &quot;quarter to two&quot;, which of course was the time of the broadcast, and many children were helped in learning to tell the time by this ingenious device.

A piece for piano duet, the &quot;Berceuse&quot; from Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Dolly Suite&quot;, Op. 56, was played at the conclusion of each broadcast and became synonymous with the programme. It was recorded for the programme by Eileen Browne and Roger Fiske, However Julia Lang, in an Anglia Television interview in the 1990s, said that during her tenure when she finished reading the story she had to get up (noiselessly), rush across to the piano in the studio and play the &quot;Berceuse&quot; live.

== &quot;Are you sitting comfortably?&quot; ==

Each story on &quot;Listen with Mother&quot; opened with the phrase &quot;Are you sitting comfortably? Then I&#x27;ll begin&quot; (sometimes &quot;...Then we&#x27;ll begin&quot;). The question, originally an ad lib by Julia Lang on 16 January 1950, became so well known that it appears in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; It has been incorporated and sampled by many artists and musicians; for instance, 
* in the episode &quot;The Idiot&#x27;s Lantern&quot;, in the revived series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, it was used by the alien presence known as &quot;The Wire&quot; appearing on a television screen and addressing its first victim, the hapless Mr Magpie. 
* in the episode &quot;School Reunion&quot;, in the revived series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, it was used by the Doctor when he addressed a classroom of students for whom he was substitute teacher.
* in a later episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Timeless Children&quot;, the line was reformulated by The Master as &quot;Are you suffering comfortably? Then I&#x27;ll begin&quot; on addressing The Doctor in the Matrix.
* as the opening of the narration by Stanley Unwin of the Small Faces&#x27; &quot;Happiness Stan&quot; song cycle on Side 2 of their &quot;Ogden&#x27;s Nut Gone Flake&quot; album, rendered in Unwin&#x27;s characteristic style: &quot;Are you all sitting comftybold two-square on your botty? Then I&#x27;ll begin.&quot;
* as the opening line in the film &quot;The Others&quot;.
* by English actor John Wood in the 1983 film &quot;WarGames&quot;. 
* in the song &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Really Matter&quot; by the Canadian band Platinum Blonde on their 1983 &quot;Standing in the Dark&quot; album.
* as the title, and included in the lyrics of, the Moody Blues song &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably?&quot; from the 1969 album &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot;. 
* at the beginning of the Slade song &quot;Did Your Mama Ever Tell Ya?&quot;, which appeared on the band&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fools.&quot;
* in the band alt-J&#x27;s song &quot;Hand-Made&quot;, from the 2012 album &quot;An Awesome Wave&quot;. 
* in the opening monologue in the episode &quot;The Narrow Escape Problem&quot; of the TV series &quot;Fargo&quot;.
* in the soundtrack of PlayStation game &quot;Jet Moto 3&quot; at &quot;Shipwreck Cove&quot; arena.
* in the Monty Python sketch &quot;Children&#x27;s Stories&quot;, from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; season 1, episode 3: &quot;How to Recognise Different Types of Trees from Quite a Long Way Away&quot;. Performer Eric Idle opens the sketch with the words: &quot;Hello children, hello. Here is this morning&#x27;s story. Are you ready? Then, we&#x27;ll begin&quot;.
* in the graphic novel &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, at the beginning of V monologue &quot;Good evening, London&quot;.

Then I&#x27;ll Begin&quot;.

<text>Stephen Desmond Brookstein (born 10 November 1968) is an English singer, who is best known for winning the first series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2004.

==Early and personal life==
Brookstein was born in Dulwich, London, England, the son of Malle, a council worker, and Errol Brookstein, a lorry driver. His father is South African and his mother is of Estonian descent. In 1997, seven years before his breakthrough on &quot;The X Factor&quot;, Brookstein was a finalist on the ITV series &quot;The Big Big Talent Show&quot;, hosted by Jonathan Ross.

==Career==
===2004–2005: &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;===
In early 2004, Brookstein auditioned for the first series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, a talent series aiming to discover new recording artists in the UK. His audition failed to impress two of the judges, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh, who thought he lacked the motivation and confidence to succeed but the third, Simon Cowell, asked Brookstein to return the following day and sing again. At the second audition, Brookstein managed to impress the other judges and was put through to the next stage of the competition. He reached the live shows, where contestants are put to the public vote, as one of three contestants in the Over 25s category mentored by Cowell. He reached the grand final on 11 December 2004 alongside G4 and won, despite him mixing up words and lines in his winner&#x27;s song and a controversial outburst against him from Osbourne. However, according to Osbourne&#x27;s subsequent autobiography, he had gained the most votes in every single one of the live shows. For five years, he held the record for the largest number of votes ever received in the final - 6 million, but this is now held by series 6 winner Joe McElderry, who received over 6.1 million votes.

After winning &quot;The X Factor&quot;, Brookstein was signed to the Sony BMG record label through which he released his first single, a cover of Phil Collins&#x27; 1984 power ballad &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, on 20 December 2004. The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number two and then climbed to number one on 2 January 2005, going one better than Collins&#x27; original and staying there for one week. In Ireland, the song peaked at number 11. The music video for the song was a montage of clips from his time on &quot;The X Factor&quot;, from his initial audition to his final performance after being declared the winner.

Brookstein released his debut album &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; on 9 May 2005 through Sony BMG. Although Brookstein continued to perform tracks from the album on television shows such as &quot;&quot;, a second single failed to materialise. In August 2005, it was announced that Sony BMG had dropped him from their line-up only eight months after his &quot;X Factor&quot; victory and despite the success of his debut single and album. Brookstein maintains that the decision to drop him reportedly came after he was offered a second album and to come back on the show, which he declined as it was to be another album of covers and he preferred a mix of old and new. In August 2005, eight months after being dropped from his record label, Brookstein publicly attacked &quot;The X Factor&quot;, claiming the show was &quot;one big theatre... turning music into the WWE&quot; and that it was &quot;killing music&quot;. Brookstein has publicly feuded with Simon Cowell and &quot;The X Factor&quot;, claiming &quot;there is absolutely no way he would want me within 100 miles of him&quot; and admitting spending years feeling bitter about the way he was treated on the show.

Although Brookstein enjoyed fleeting success with both his debut album and single both reaching number one – &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; and &quot;Against All Odds&quot; respectively – he was dropped by Cowell&#x27;s management after the latter was accused of refusing Brookstein creative freedom.

===2008–2010: Musicals and controversies===
In June 2007, Brookstein appeared on the P&amp;O Portsmouth to Bilbao car ferry, alongside &quot;The X Factor&quot; series 2 alumni Chico Slimani and Journey South. In 2008, he played &#x27;the father&#x27; in a touring production of the musical &quot;Our House&quot;.

In December 2009, when a Facebook campaign was launched to stop &quot;The X Factor&quot; winner from achieving the coveted Christmas number 1 spot, Brookstein backed the campaign to see Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; reach the top of the chart, targeting Cowell in an online rant. He further attacked Cowell, claiming the latter &quot;ruined Christmas&quot; and that he was dropped from his record label because he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t play the game&quot;. Brookstein also claimed the show was staged and the winner was fixed, and was subsequently removed from the official &quot;The X Factor&quot; website following those comments. Despite Brookstein&#x27;s bitterness towards &quot;The X Factor&quot;, he signed up to critique the show weekly on &quot;London 24&quot; in 2010, where he labelled the judges &quot;ridiculous&quot; and questioned the standards of several of the finalists, including One Direction band member Louis Tomlinson, and the vocal coach.

===2011–present: Musical hiatus and &quot;Forgotten Man&quot;===
In 2013, Brookstein announced that his new album would be called &quot;Forgotten Man&quot; and would be released on 23 March 2014.

Brookstein released a book on 21 November 2014, &quot;Getting over the X&quot;, that describes his journey from winning &quot;The X Factor&quot; to having the press and industry turn their backs on him.

<doc id="1276423" wikidata="Q13424416" url="?curid=1276423" title="Operating Thetan">
<text>In Scientology, Operating Thetan (OT) is a state of complete spiritual freedom in which one is a &quot;willing and knowing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time&quot;. The Church of Scientology offers eight &quot;levels&quot; of OT, each level costing thousands of US dollars. Each OT level is confidential and is not revealed to anyone beforehand. In summary, the objective of these levels is to remove &quot;body thetans&quot; which are &quot;confused, disembodied souls from other planets who have attached themselves to us&quot;.

== Description ==
The OT levels are the upper part of &quot;The Bridge to Total Freedom&quot;, which is the set of levels within Scientology. After having removed one&#x27;s own &quot;reactive mind&quot; and thus attaining the state of &quot;Clear&quot;, Scientologists may then go on to the OT levels. Scientology doctrine defines OT as the &quot;highest state there is&quot;. Operating Thetan is represented by a symbol consisting of the letters OT with the T inside the O and each of the points of the T ending at the O&#x27;s circumference.

An Operating Thetan (OT) is described within Scientology as a state of godliness, and Scientologists are taught they will have godlike control over &quot;matter, energy, space and time&quot; (known in Scientology jargon as MEST). Hubbard claimed that thetans were once tricked into following religions, which prevented them from using their own power to create and destroy universes. The Church claims that an OT is not dependent on the physical universe, and Scientologists who have attained the highest Operating Thetan level claim that they have control over their lives and can &quot;go exterior&quot; from their bodies.

According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, &quot;[The OT levels are] basically a variation of the Gnostic myth about souls falling into matter and the encumbrances that come with that. ... In the OT [levels], you&#x27;re finding out that you&#x27;re a thetan, that you&#x27;ve come into bodies before. Part of what you&#x27;re trying to learn is exteriorization — how to get out of your body. You also learn that you carry a lot of encumbrances from past lives.&quot;

While there are fifteen OT levels listed on Scientology&#x27;s Classification, Gradation and Awareness Chart, the Church only offers eight. According to former Scientologist and critic of the Church Mike Rinder, the promise of new levels has been used for decades to motivate church members to donate or repeat courses they have already taken in preparation. Rinder has said he doesn&#x27;t believe these courses exist.

== Confidential materials ==

Since the 1960s when Hubbard invented the OT levels, they have been considered confidential. Those who read such documents do so in locked rooms, transport them in locked briefcases attached to their wrists, and the documents are securely locked up when not in actual use. Members are forbidden to discuss the OT levels with anyone, may not disclose the contents or procedures, and may not make copies or even notes.

One must be &quot;invited&quot; to do the OT levels. &quot;OT preps&quot; are preparatory steps to ensure that one is ready for them, and this includes security checks (confessionals) to make certain that the person is not a security risk and will keep the confidentiality of the OT materials.

Scientology has been active in litigating to keep their OT levels secret. In the 1980s Wollersheim case, the OT III materials were entered into evidence by Wollersheim to show how they made him psychotic, eventually getting published in the news when an agency got their hands on a copy from the courthouse. In the 1990s Fishman case, the entire OT levels from I to VIII were presented, eventually leading to others obtaining them and later duplicated on the internet. This led to several raids of homes and offices, and lawsuits against several people who had put copies on the internet. Such acts collectively became known as Scientology versus the Internet.

On March 24, 2008, WikiLeaks published on its website the previously secret training instructions for all eight OT levels. Three days later the law firm of Moxon &amp; Kobrin sent a letter to Wikileaks on behalf of the Church of Scientology demanding to have the documents removed. In response, Wikileaks stated they would not comply and would instead post even more Scientology documents. The Church of Scientology failed to get the documents removed from the website.

Hugh B. Urban explores the purpose of secrecy in the Operating Thetan levels in the Church of Scientology by discussing its related controversy. He claims that secrecy is a motivating tool for Scientologists to desire to climb &quot;The Bridge of Total Freedom,&quot; specifically to attain the level of OT VIII.

== OT levels ==

Although The Bridge to Total Freedom lists 15 OT levels above the state of Clear, only seven were released during Hubbard&#x27;s lifetime, while OT VIII was released to the public in 1988, two years after Hubbard&#x27;s 1986 death.

Levels OT I through OT V can be delivered only at Church of Scientology Advanced Organizations. OT VI and OT VII can be delivered only at Flag Service Org. OT VIII can be delivered only at Flag Ship Service Org aboard Scientology&#x27;s ship &quot;Freewinds&quot;.

=== OT I ===
&quot;This Solo-audited level is the first step a Clear takes toward full OT abilities, and that first step is a fresh causative OT viewpoint of the MEST universe and other beings.&quot; The cost to move to level OT I was $2,750 as of 2013.

=== OT II ===
&quot;By confronting hidden areas of one&#x27;s existence on the whole track [that is, by confronting past incarnations], vast amounts of energy and attention are released. Those on this Solo-audited level experience a resurgence of self-determinism and native ability. OT II unlocks the aberrative factors on the whole track that have allowed the thetan to lose his innate freedom and ability and one achieves the ability to confront the whole track.&quot; The cost to move from OT I to OT II was $5,225 as of 2013.

=== OT III: Wall of Fire ===
Media attention has mostly focused on Operating Thetan Level III, which reportedly tells the history of the universe from 75 million years ago. This level is called the &quot;First Wall of Fire&quot; and claims to &quot;reveal the cause of earthly human suffering&quot;. It is claimed that even Hubbard himself had difficulty attaining it.

Hubbard announced discovering an important breakthrough within less than a month of founding the Sea Org, the religious order of the church that consists of its most dedicated members. He described it as a &quot;means of erasing those mental factors that stand in the way of peace and toleration of mankind&quot;. The new material made up the new Operating Thetan III.

&quot;This Solo-audited level goes through what is called the &#x27;Wall of Fire&#x27; that surrounds a previously impenetrable whole track mystery. What prevents a being from being himself? This level answers that question. Once complete, a being is free of the whole track overwhelm that has trapped him. Here he confronts and eradicates the fourth dynamic engram that has plagued this universe for millennia.&quot; The cost to move from OT II to OT III was $8,910 as of 2013.

Church dogma regards OT III as a dangerous process which can lead to pneumonia, to lack of sleep or even to death if not run correctly. In &quot;Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman&quot;, it was noted that the defendant had been required to sign a waiver to the effect that &quot;the Scientology Organization, its branches and members, and L. Ron Hubbard are not responsible for anything that might happen to my body or mind on OT III&quot;.

Within OT III is the secret doctrine of the church. Members must be invited to &quot;do it&quot;, and they sign a contract of secrecy.

=== OT IV: OT Drug Rundown ===
&quot;This level handles the hidden problems and stops in a being&#x27;s universe caused by the effects of drugs and poisons on the whole track. This is the final polish that rids one of any last vestige of the effects of drugs on the spirit. Ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 12½ to 25 hours.&quot;

=== OT V: Audited New Era Dianetics for OTs (NOTs) ===
&quot;The Second Wall of Fire consists of 26 separate rundowns and has been described as dealing with &#x27;living lightning, the very stuff of life itself.&#x27; This level addresses the last aspects of one&#x27;s case that can prevent him from achieving total freedom on all dynamics. An audited level ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 50 hours.&quot;

=== OT VI: Solo NOTs Auditing Course ===
&quot;The training one receives before starting to solo audit on New OT VII is so powerful that it actually constitutes an entire OT level. On Solo NOTs one is dealing with complexities intended to crush one&#x27;s true power and abilities as a thetan. Solo NOTs auditors acquire a wide range of auditing skills to handle the vast phenomena that can occur on OT VIII. Approximately 3–4 weeks with the new Solo Auditor Course done.&quot;

=== OT VII: Solo NOTs ===
&quot;On New OT VII one solo audits at home daily. This is a lengthy level, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. It is the final pre-OT level, and culminates in attainment of the state of CAUSE OVER LIFE.&quot;

=== OT VIII: Truth Revealed ===

OT VIII is the highest level in Scientology, and is only offered aboard the &quot;Freewinds&quot; ship. It supposedly reveals &quot;the ultimate secret of Hubbard&#x27;s teachings&quot;.

The original version of OT VIII was released in 1988 and was authored by Hubbard himself, while a second &quot;revised&quot; version was released in 1991 by an unnamed editor. Both versions were released after L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s death. The original contains a Doomsday Prophecy that the Galactic Confederacy will return soon and telepathically enslave the universe but Hubbard wrote that he will return after his death and in a Messiah-like role &quot;halt a series of events designed to make happy slaves of us all&quot;. Early participants in this version balked at it and the church subsequently revised it into its current form. The church initially stated the original version found in the Fishman Affidavit is a forgery but later admitted it was copyrighted by the church thus establishing authenticity. The revised version they currently use also has an editor&#x27;s note that states &quot;it is not the original&quot;.

The revised version is completely redacted from the original and states &quot;This Solo-audited level addresses the primary cause of amnesia on the whole track and lets one see the truth of his own existence. This is the first actual OT level and brings about a resurgence of power and native abilities for the being himself. This may be done at the Flag Ship Service Organization.&quot;

According to interviews performed by Mike Rinder, Scientologists have described OT VIII as &quot;less than overwhelming&quot;.

=== OT IX to OT X ===

Since 1986, Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige has dangled the hope of OT IX and X being released in the near future, pending certain conditions, which have shifted over time. It has been widely reported that Hubbard never wrote OT IX and above; therefore, those levels do not exist.

== Cleared Theta Clear ==

Beyond the attainment of the state of Operating Thetan is that of Cleared Theta Clear, which Hubbard describes as such:
== Criticism ==

A growing number of former Scientologists have made public allegations that the church encourages its members to complete very expensive courses and expect wonderful results; when the improvements fail to happen, further courses are then promoted to facilitate the anticipated changes. Criticism stems from a pattern of cycles wherein members continue to pay increasing amounts for these courses, while some even put their families into debt chasing the elusive life-changing results under the stewardship of the church.

=== Legal issues and copyright ===

In March 2008, WikiLeaks leaked the Church of Scientology&#x27;s &quot;Operating Thetan&quot; documents. The Church of Scientology portrayed hosting the documentation as a copyright violation implying that the collection is Church doctrine. A court found that it was legal to download, use, read, and practice these teachings outside the Church.

In 1997, Zenon Panoussis, a resident of Sweden, sent copies of NOTs documents to various government authorities, thereby making the documents public according to the Swedish principle of public access to official records. The Church of Scientology responded by ordering members to continuously borrow the available copies in order to prevent non-members from reading them. The Church of Scientology also sued Panoussis for copyright infringement, since he had made the documents available online without authorization.

A similar incident occurred during the 1980s, during the trial of &quot;Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology&quot;. When the OT III documents had been entered into evidence, 1,500 Scientologists crammed the courthouse in an attempt to block public access to the documents by each requesting to photocopy them, thus overwhelming the clerk&#x27;s office so no one else could access them.

<text>Robert Hamish McCutcheon (born 1947), known as Sandy McCutcheon is an Australian author, playwright, actor, journalist and broadcaster.

==Biography==
McCutcheon was born Brian David Parry in Christchurch, New Zealand, though he did not learn this until 1997, aged 50, when his adoption papers were discovered. When he was nearly three, his parents divorced and he was adopted by another family, who renamed him as Robert, nicknamed Sandy. His adoptive parents denied that he was adopted and told him his early childhood memories were the product of his imagination. As an adult, he spent several years trying to trace his family in Europe, before finding relatives living in New Zealand. During the search he met his 30-year-old daughter Yvonne for the first time, who he had fathered in London when he was 20. He also discovered that his birth mother had been adopted.

He moved to Australia in 1970 and now lives in Fez, Morocco with his wife, photographer Suzanna Clarke. He is involved in the Woodford Folk Festival, the Festival of Sufi Culture (in Fez) and the Festival of World Sacred Music (in Fez). He has had four children from three marriages, as well as Yvonne.

Until late 2006, McCutcheon hosted talkback radio program &quot;Australia Talks Back&quot;, since renamed &quot;Australia Talks&quot;, on ABC Radio National. &quot;Australia Talks Back&quot; was the only continent-wide talkback radio program, as well as gathering listeners from around the world through the internet and Radio Australia shortwave broadcasts. It ran for an hour every weekday and featured discussion of a particular topic every day, reviewing the week&#x27;s topics on Friday. Since leaving the ABC he has returned to his career as a writer and public speaker.

McCutcheon&#x27;s earlier work included presenting ABC&#x27;s Double Jay, later Triple J, now an Australia-wide radio station. Before that he worked at radio stations in Townsville and Hobart.

McCutcheon has produced radio documentaries in Bosnia, China, Finland, Malaysia, Mozambique, Singapore, South Africa, Sudan (North and South) and Yugoslavia.

McCutcheon has won Australian radio awards and been recognised at the New York International Radio Festival.

McCutcheon has been awarded the International Kalevala Medal for services to Finnish culture (for his work on the Kalevala). He has worked in Finland on a scholarship, and in particular, at the Finnish Broadcasting Company.

McCutcheon has written 22 plays for the theatre. He won the Samuel Weisberg Playwriting Award in 1991 for the best Jewish play of the year for &quot;Night Train&quot;, as he had for a long time believed himself to be Jewish, before finding out the truth about his ancestral past.

McCutcheon founded the Illusion Farm, based in the Tasmania mountains, a Buddhist centre providing care for people in need, free of charge. It has accommodated more than 3,000 people during its operation. The Illusion Circus Theatre Company has also been based on the farm.

==Bibliography==
McCutcheon has written a number of bestselling novels. His first, &quot;In Wolf&#x27;s Clothing&quot; (1997), was the runner-up in the 1995 HarperCollins National Fiction Prize out of 400 novels. His other novels include
*&quot;Peace Crimes&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Poison Tree&quot; (1999)
*&quot;Safe Haven&quot; (2000)
*&quot;Delicate Indecencies&quot; (2002)
*&quot;The Haha Man&quot; (2003)
*&quot;The Cobbler&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (to be published September 2006)
*&quot;Black Widow &quot; (2006)
&quot;Black Widow&quot; is based on events following the September 1, 2004 terrorist attack on a Russian school in the southern town of Beslan.

Other books by McCutcheon are &quot;Blik!&quot; (2002), an illustrated book for children and &quot;Quirky Questions&quot; (2000) New edition of &quot;More Quirky Questions&quot; (2005).

McCutcheon has also written many short stories and poems. His memoir, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Son&quot;, published in 2005 by Penguin, is an autobiographical work. The title is taken from a dream he had about finding his birth father, in which he discovered a magician&#x27;s trunk in an attic. When he found out who his birth parents were, he learned that his father had in fact been an amateur magician.

<doc id="1276432" wikidata="Q6780510" url="?curid=1276432" title="Mary Perkins, On Stage">
<text>Mary Perkins, On Stage (originally titled simply On Stage) is an American newspaper comic strip by Leonard Starr for the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate. It ran from February 10, 1957, to September 9, 1979, with the switch to the longer title in 1961. Some papers carried the strip under the shortened title Mary Perkins.

The strip came to a conclusion when Starr left in 1979 to take over &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;.

==Origins==
Having previously worked on comic books, Starr decided to try to publish a newspaper comic strip. Starr submitted his concepts to Moe Riley, a vice president at the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. Riley chose two of Starr&#x27;s ideas: one about a missionary who worked in foreign countries and the other about a young woman who comes to New York to become an actress. The syndicate chose the second idea, and Starr was hired to produce &quot;On Stage&quot;.

==Characters and story==
Starr&#x27;s scripts mixed soap opera, adventure and broad humor, while the art was characterized by a studied line and often innovative storytelling. The strip offered a Broadway backstage drama as it followed the career of actress Mary Perkins in New York, Hollywood and on various international film sets and locations. A host of supporting characters joined Mary, including (in early September 1957) her photographer beau, Pete Fletcher. The two married on December 13, 1959.

The first On Stage Sunday strip was launched February 10, 1957. That is generally considered the start date for the strip, but in 1970, comics historian Raymond Miller wrote that internal evidence in the first Sunday page suggested the strip had at least a week&#x27;s worth of prior daily strips.

==Awards==

Starr won the National Cartoonists Society Story Comic Strip Award for the series in 1960 and 1963, and its Reuben Award in 1965.

==Reception== 
Discussing &quot;On Stage&quot;, comics historian Bob Bindig wrote that &quot;the artwork is excellent...Starr likes to draw and it shows in his work. Each panel is a well developed planned illustration.&quot; Writer Dennis Wepman stated &quot;&quot;On Stage&quot; transcended the conventions of the sentimental romance and tearjerker, incorporating elements of high comedy and often gripping adventure and suspense.&quot;

==Reprints==
Classic Comics Press announced in February 2006 that it had an agreement with Tribune Media Services to release chronological collected volumes of &quot;On Stage&quot;. The first appeared in June 2006, reprinting the strips of February 10, 1957 to January 11, 1958. The second volume was released later in 2006, the third in 2007 and the fourth in 2008. By 2016, the entire run of the strip had been reprinted in fifteen volumes.

<doc id="1276437" wikidata="Q471872" url="?curid=1276437" title="Soil mechanics">
<text>Soil mechanics is a branch of soil physics and applied mechanics that describes the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and solid mechanics in the sense that soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air and water) and particles (usually clay, silt, sand, and gravel) but soil may also contain organic solids and other matter. Along with rock mechanics, soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in geotechnical engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, and engineering geology, a subdiscipline of geology. Soil mechanics is used to analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried in soils. Example applications are building and bridge foundations, retaining walls, dams, and buried pipeline systems. Principles of soil mechanics are also used in related disciplines such as geophysical engineering, coastal engineering, agricultural engineering, and hydrology.

This article describes the genesis and composition of soil, the distinction between &quot;pore water pressure&quot; and inter-granular &quot;effective stress&quot;, capillary action of fluids in the soil pore spaces, &quot;soil classification&quot;, &quot;seepage&quot; and &quot;permeability&quot;, time dependent change of volume due to squeezing water out of tiny pore spaces, also known as &quot;consolidation&quot;, &quot;shear strength&quot; and stiffness of soils. The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between the particles and interlocking, which are very sensitive to the effective stress. The article concludes with some examples of applications of the principles of soil mechanics such as slope stability, lateral earth pressure on retaining walls, and bearing capacity of foundations.

==Genesis and composition of soils==

===Genesis===
The primary mechanism of soil creation is the weathering of rock. All rock types (igneous rock, metamorphic rock and sedimentary rock) may be broken down into small particles to create soil. Weathering mechanisms are physical weathering, chemical weathering, and biological weathering Human activities such as excavation, blasting, and waste disposal, may also create soil. Over geologic time, deeply buried soils may be altered by pressure and temperature to become metamorphic or sedimentary rock, and if melted and solidified again, they would complete the geologic cycle by becoming igneous rock.

Physical weathering includes temperature effects, freeze and thaw of water in cracks, rain, wind, impact and other mechanisms. Chemical weathering includes dissolution of matter composing a rock and precipitation in the form of another mineral. Clay minerals, for example can be formed by weathering of feldspar, which is the most common mineral present in igneous rock.

The most common mineral constituent of silt and sand is quartz, also called silica, which has the chemical name silicon dioxide. The reason that feldspar is most common in rocks but silica is more prevalent in soils is that feldspar is much more soluble than silica.

Silt, Sand, and Gravel are basically little pieces of broken rocks.

According to the Unified Soil Classification System, silt particle sizes are in the range of 0.002 mm to 0.075 mm and sand particles have sizes in the range of 0.075 mm to 4.75 mm.

Gravel particles are broken pieces of rock in the size range 4.75 mm to 100 mm. Particles larger than gravel are called cobbles and boulders.

===Transport===

Soil deposits are affected by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect at the bottom of a river bed. Wind blown soil deposits (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; soil deposits transported by gravity are called colluvium.

The mechanism of transport also has a major effect on the particle shape. For example, low velocity grinding in a river bed will produce rounded particles. Freshly fractured colluvium particles often have a very angular shape.

===Soil composition===

====Soil mineralogy====
Silts, sands and gravels are classified by their size, and hence they may consist of a variety of minerals. Owing to the stability of quartz compared to other rock minerals, quartz is the most common constituent of sand and silt. Mica, and feldspar are other common minerals present in sands and silts. The mineral constituents of gravel may be more similar to that of the parent rock.

The common clay minerals are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend to form in sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7 m and 4x10−6 m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9 m and 2x10−6 m, and they have a relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. 

The minerals of soils are predominantly formed by atoms of oxygen, silicon, hydrogen, and aluminum, organized in various crystalline forms. These elements along with calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and carbon constitute over 99 per cent of the solid mass of soils.

====Grain size distribution====

Soils consist of a mixture of particles of different size, shape and mineralogy. Because the size of the particles obviously has a significant effect on the soil behavior, the grain size and grain size distribution are used to classify soils. The grain size distribution describes the relative proportions of particles of various sizes. The grain size is often visualized in a cumulative distribution graph which, for example, plots the percentage of particles finer than a given size as a function of size. The median grain size, formula_1, is the size for which 50% of the particle mass consists of finer particles. Soil behavior, especially the hydraulic conductivity, tends to be dominated by the smaller particles, hence, the term &quot;effective size&quot;, denoted by formula_2, is defined as the size for which 10% of the particle mass consists of finer particles.

Sands and gravels that possess a wide range of particle sizes with a smooth distribution of particle sizes are called &quot;well graded&quot; soils. If the soil particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes, the sample is &quot;uniformly graded&quot;. If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no coarse sand, the sample may be &quot;gap graded&quot;. &quot;Uniformly graded&quot; and &quot;gap graded&quot; soils are both considered to be &quot;poorly graded&quot;. There are many methods for measuring particle-size distribution. The two traditional methods are sieve analysis and hydrometer analysis.

===== Sieve analysis =====

The size distribution of gravel and sand particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put into the top of a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method. If there are a lot of fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and clods through.

A variety of sieve sizes are available. The boundary between sand and silt is arbitrary. According to the Unified Soil Classification System, a #4 sieve (4 openings per inch) having 4.75 mm opening size separates sand from gravel and a #200 sieve with an 0.075 mm opening separates sand from silt and clay. According to the British standard, 0.063 mm is the boundary between sand and silt, and 2 mm is the boundary between sand and gravel.

=====Hydrometer analysis=====
The classification of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If it is important to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer. Sand particles may take less than a second. Stokes&#x27; law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the Hydrometer test.

Clay particles can be sufficiently small that they never settle because they are kept in suspension by Brownian motion, in which case they may be classified as colloids.

====Mass-volume relations====

There are a variety of parameters used to describe the relative proportions of air, water and solid in a soil. This section defines these parameters and some of their interrelationships. The basic notation is as follows:

:formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 represent the volumes of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;

:formula_6, formula_7, and formula_8 represent the weights of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;

:formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11 represent the masses of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;

:formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14 represent the densities of the constituents (air, water and solids) in a soil mixture;

Note that the weights, W, can be obtained by multiplying the mass, M, by the acceleration due to gravity, g; e.g., formula_15

Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one material compared to the density of pure water (formula_16).

&quot;Specific gravity of solids&quot;, formula_17

Note that specific weight, conventionally denoted by the symbol formula_18 may be obtained by multiplying the density ( formula_19 ) of a material by the acceleration due to gravity, formula_20.

&quot;Density&quot;, &quot;bulk density&quot;, or &quot;wet density&quot;, formula_19, are different names for the density of the mixture, i.e., the total mass of air, water, solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids (the mass of air is assumed to be zero for practical purposes):
:formula_22

&quot;Dry density&quot;, formula_23, is the mass of solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids:
:formula_24

&quot;Buoyant density&quot;, formula_25, defined as the density of the mixture minus the density of water is useful if the soil is submerged under water:
:formula_26
where formula_27 is the density of water

&quot;Water content&quot;, formula_28 is the ratio of mass of water to mass of solid. It is easily measured by weighing a sample of the soil, drying it out in an oven and re-weighing. Standard procedures are described by ASTM.
:formula_29

&quot;Void ratio&quot;, formula_30, is the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids:
:formula_31

&quot;Porosity&quot;, formula_32, is the ratio of volume of voids to the total volume, and is related to the void ratio:
:formula_33

&quot;Degree of saturation&quot;, formula_34, is the ratio of the volume of water to the volume of voids:
:formula_35

From the above definitions, some useful relationships can be derived by use of basic algebra. 
:formula_36

:formula_37

:formula_38

==Soil classification==
Geotechnical engineers classify the soil particle types by performing tests on disturbed (dried, passed through sieves, and remolded) samples of the soil. This provides information about the characteristics of the soil grains themselves. Classification of the types of grains present in a soil does not account for important effects of the &quot;structure&quot; or &quot;fabric&quot; of the soil, terms that describe compactness of the particles and patterns in the arrangement of particles in a load carrying framework as well as the pore size and pore fluid distributions. Engineering geologists also classify soils based on their genesis and depositional history.

===Classification of soil grains===
In the US and other countries, the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) is often used for soil classification. Other classification systems include the British Standard BS 5930 and the AASHTO soil classification system.

====Classification of sands and gravels====
In the USCS, gravels (given the symbol &quot;G&quot;) and sands (given the symbol &quot;S&quot;) are classified according to their grain size distribution. For the USCS, gravels may be given the classification symbol &quot;GW&quot; (well-graded gravel), &quot;GP&quot; (poorly graded gravel), &quot;GM&quot; (gravel with a large amount of silt), or &quot;GC&quot; (gravel with a large amount of clay). Likewise sands may be classified as being &quot;SW&quot;, &quot;SP&quot;, &quot;SM&quot; or &quot;SC&quot;. Sands and gravels with a small but non-negligible amount of fines (5–12%) may be given a dual classification such as &quot;SW-SC&quot;.

====Atterberg limits====
Clays and Silts, often called &#x27;fine-grained soils&#x27;, are classified according to their Atterberg limits; the most commonly used Atterberg limits are the &quot;liquid limit&quot; (denoted by &quot;LL&quot; or formula_39), &quot;plastic limit&quot; (denoted by &quot;PL&quot; or formula_40), and &quot;shrinkage limit&quot; (denoted by &quot;SL&quot;).

The liquid limit is the water content at which the soil behavior transitions from a plastic solid to a liquid. The plastic limit is the water content at which the soil behavior transitions from that of a plastic solid to a brittle solid. The Shrinkage Limit corresponds to a water content below which the soil will not shrink as it dries. The consistency of fine grained soil varies in proportional to the water content in a soil.

As the transitions from one state to another are gradual, the tests have adopted arbitrary definitions to determine the boundaries of the states. The liquid limit is determined by measuring the water content for which a groove closes after 25 blows in a standard test. Alternatively, a fall cone test apparatus may be used to measure the liquid limit. The undrained shear strength of remolded soil at the liquid limit is approximately 2 kPa. The plastic limit is the water content below which it is not possible to roll by hand the soil into 3 mm diameter cylinders. The soil cracks or breaks up as it is rolled down to this diameter. Remolded soil at the plastic limit is quite stiff, having an undrained shear strength of the order of about 200 kPa.

The &quot;plasticity index&quot; of a particular soil specimen is defined as the difference between the liquid limit and the plastic limit of the specimen; it is an indicator of how much water the soil particles in the specimen can absorb, and correlates with many engineering properties like permeability, compressibility, shear strength and others. Generally, the clay having high plasticity have lower permeability and also they are also difficult to be compacted.

====Classification of silts and clays====
According to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), silts and clays are classified by plotting the values of their plasticity index and liquid limit on a plasticity chart. The A-Line on the chart separates clays (given the USCS symbol &quot;C&quot;) from silts (given the symbol &quot;M&quot;). LL=50% separates high plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol &quot;H&quot;) from low plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol &quot;L&quot;). A soil that plots above the A-line and has LL&gt;50% would, for example, be classified as &quot;CH&quot;. Other possible classifications of silts and clays are &quot;ML&quot;, &quot;CL&quot; and &quot;MH&quot;. If the Atterberg limits plot in the&quot;hatched&quot; region on the graph near the origin, the soils are given the dual classification &#x27;CL-ML&#x27;.

===Indices related to soil strength===

====Liquidity index====
The effects of the water content on the strength of saturated remolded soils can be quantified by the use of the &quot;liquidity index&quot;, &quot;LI&quot;:

:formula_41

When the LI is 1, remolded soil is at the liquid limit and it has an undrained shear strength of about 2 kPa. When the soil is at the plastic limit, the LI is 0 and the undrained shear strength is about 200 kPa.

====Relative density====
The density of sands (cohesionless soils) is often characterized by the relative density, formula_42

:formula_43

where: formula_44 is the &quot;maximum void ratio&quot; corresponding to a very loose state, formula_45 is the &quot;minimum void ratio&quot; corresponding to a very dense state and formula_30 is the &quot;in situ&quot; void ratio. Methods used to calculate relative density are defined in ASTM D4254-00(2006).

Thus if formula_47 the sand or gravel is very dense, and if formula_48 the soil is extremely loose and unstable.

==Seepage: steady state flow of water==
==Effective stress and capillarity: hydrostatic conditions==
To understand the mechanics of soils it is necessary to understand how normal stresses and shear stresses are shared by the different phases. Neither gas nor liquid provide significant resistance to shear stress. The shear resistance of soil is provided by friction and interlocking of the particles. The friction depends on the intergranular contact stresses between solid particles. The normal stresses, on the other hand, are shared by the fluid and the particles. Although the pore air is relatively compressible, and hence takes little normal stress in most geotechnical problems, liquid water is relatively incompressible and if the voids are saturated with water, the pore water must be squeezed out in order to pack the particles closer together.

The principle of effective stress, introduced by Karl Terzaghi, states that the effective stress &quot;σ&quot;&#x27; (i.e., the average intergranular stress between solid particles) may be calculated by a simple subtraction of the pore pressure from the total stress:

:formula_49

where &quot;σ&quot; is the total stress and &quot;u&quot; is the pore pressure. It is not practical to measure &quot;σ&quot;&#x27; directly, so in practice the vertical effective stress is calculated from the pore pressure and vertical total stress. The distinction between the terms pressure and stress is also important. By definition, pressure at a point is equal in all directions but stresses at a point can be different in different directions. In soil mechanics, compressive stresses and pressures are considered to be positive and tensile stresses are considered to be negative, which is different from the solid mechanics sign convention for stress.

===Total stress===
For level ground conditions, the total vertical stress at a point, formula_50, on average, is the weight of everything above that point per unit area. The vertical stress beneath a uniform surface layer with density formula_19, and thickness formula_52 is for example:

:formula_53

where formula_20 is the acceleration due to gravity, and formula_18 is the unit weight of the overlying layer. If there are multiple layers of soil or water above the point of interest, the vertical stress may be calculated by summing the product of the unit weight and thickness of all of the overlying layers. Total stress increases with increasing depth in proportion to the density of the overlying soil.

It is not possible to calculate the horizontal total stress in this way. Lateral earth pressures are addressed elsewhere.

===Pore water pressure===
====Hydrostatic conditions====
If the soil pores are filled with water that is not flowing but is static, the pore water pressures will be hydrostatic. The water table is located at the depth where the water pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For hydrostatic conditions, the water pressure increases linearly with depth below the water table:

:formula_56

where formula_13 is the density of water, and formula_58 is the depth below the water table.

====Capillary action====
Due to surface tension, water will rise up in a small capillary tube above a free surface of water. Likewise, water will rise up above the water table into the small pore spaces around the soil particles. In fact the soil may be completely saturated for some distance above the water table. Above the height of capillary saturation, the soil may be wet but the water content will decrease with elevation. If the water in the capillary zone is not moving, the water pressure obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, formula_56, but note that formula_60, is negative above the water table. Hence, hydrostatic water pressures are negative above the water table. The thickness of the zone of capillary saturation depends on the pore size, but typically, the heights vary between a centimeter or so for coarse sand to tens of meters for a silt or clay. In fact the pore space of soil is a uniform fractal e.g. a set of uniformly distributed D-dimensional fractals of average linear size L. For the clay soil it has been found that L=0.15 mm and D=2.7.

The surface tension of water explains why the water does not drain out of a wet sand castle or a moist ball of clay. Negative water pressures make the water stick to the particles and pull the particles to each other, friction at the particle contacts make a sand castle stable. But as soon as a wet sand castle is submerged below a free water surface, the negative pressures are lost and the castle collapses. Considering the effective stress equation, formula_61 if the water pressure is negative, the effective stress may be positive, even on a free surface (a surface where the total normal stress is zero). The negative pore pressure pulls the particles together and causes compressive particle to particle contact forces. 
Negative pore pressures in clayey soil can be much more powerful than those in sand. Negative pore pressures explain why clay soils shrink when they dry and swell as they are wetted. The swelling and shrinkage can cause major distress, especially to light structures and roads.

Later sections of this article address the pore water pressures for seepage and consolidation problems.

==Consolidation: transient flow of water==

Consolidation is a process by which soils decrease in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze the water out of a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out in a matter of seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of one-dimensional consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Afterwards, Maurice Biot fully developed the three-dimensional soil consolidation theory, extending the one-dimensional model previously developed by Terzaghi to more general hypotheses and introducing the set of basic equations of Poroelasticity. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.

When stress is removed from a consolidated soil, the soil will rebound, drawing water back into the pores and regaining some of the volume it had lost in the consolidation process. If the stress is reapplied, the soil will re-consolidate again along a recompression curve, defined by the recompression index. Soil that has been consolidated to a large pressure and has been subsequently unloaded is considered to be &quot;overconsolidated&quot;. The maximum past vertical effective stress is termed the &quot;preconsolidation stress&quot;. A soil which is currently experiencing the maximum past vertical effective stress is said to be &quot;normally consolidated&quot;. The &quot;overconsolidation ratio&quot;, (OCR) is the ratio of the maximum past vertical effective stress to the current vertical effective stress. The OCR is significant for two reasons: firstly, because the compressibility of normally consolidated soil is significantly larger than that for overconsolidated soil, and secondly, the shear behavior and dilatancy of clayey soil are related to the OCR through critical state soil mechanics; highly overconsolidated clayey soils are dilatant, while normally consolidated soils tend to be contractive.

==Shear behavior: stiffness and strength==
The shear strength and stiffness of soil determines whether or not soil will be stable or how much it will deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the &quot;shear strength&quot; and the &quot;yield point&quot; for a soil element from a stress–strain curve. One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a stress–strain curve, or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the shear resistance levels off. If the stress–strain curve does not stabilize before the end of shear strength test, the &quot;strength&quot; is sometimes considered to be the shear resistance at 15–20% strain. The shear strength of soil depends on many factors including the effective stress and the void ratio.

The shear stiffness is important, for example, for evaluation of the magnitude of deformations of foundations and slopes prior to failure and because it is related to the shear wave velocity. The slope of the initial, nearly linear, portion of a plot of shear stress as a function of shear strain is called the shear modulus

===Friction, interlocking and dilation===

Soil is an assemblage of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane. The angle of internal friction is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.

But in addition to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from each other as they are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio.
The tendency for a soil to dilate or contract depends primarily on the confining pressure and the void ratio of the soil. The rate of dilation is high if the confining pressure is small and the void ratio is small. The rate of contraction is high if the confining pressure is large and the void ratio is large. As a first approximation, the regions of contraction and dilation are separated by the critical state line.

===Failure criteria===
After a soil reaches the critical state, it is no longer contracting or dilating and the shear stress on the failure plane formula_62
is determined by the effective normal stress on the failure plane formula_63
and critical state friction angle formula_64:

:formula_65

The peak strength of the soil may be greater, however, due to the interlocking (dilatancy) contribution. 
This may be stated:

:formula_66

where formula_67. However, use of a friction angle greater than the critical state value for design requires care. The peak strength will not be mobilized everywhere at the same time in a practical problem such as a foundation, slope or retaining wall. The critical state friction angle is not nearly as variable as the peak friction angle and hence it can be relied upon with confidence.

Not recognizing the significance of dilatancy, Coulomb proposed that the shear strength of soil may be expressed as a combination of adhesion and friction components:

:formula_68

It is now known that the formula_69
and formula_70 parameters in the last equation are not fundamental soil properties. In particular, formula_71 and formula_72 are different depending on the magnitude of effective stress. According to Schofield (2006), the longstanding use of formula_73 in practice has led many engineers to wrongly believe that formula_74 is a fundamental parameter. This assumption that formula_71 and formula_72 are constant can lead to overestimation of peak strengths.

===Structure, fabric, and chemistry===
In addition to the friction and interlocking (dilatancy) components of strength, the structure and fabric also play a significant role in the soil behavior. The structure and fabric include factors such as the spacing and arrangement of the solid particles or the amount and spatial distribution of pore water; in some cases cementitious material accumulates at particle-particle contacts. Mechanical behavior of soil is affected by the density of the particles and their structure or arrangement of the particles as well as the amount and spatial distribution of fluids present (e.g., water and air voids). Other factors include the electrical charge of the particles, chemistry of pore water, chemical bonds (i.e. cementation -particles connected through a solid substance such as recrystallized calcium carbonate) 

===Drained and undrained shear===

The presence of nearly incompressible fluids such as water in the pore spaces affects the ability for the pores to dilate or contract.

If the pores are saturated with water, water must be sucked into the dilating pore spaces to fill the expanding pores (this phenomenon is visible at the beach when apparently dry spots form around feet that press into the wet sand).

Similarly, for contractive soil, water must be squeezed out of the pore spaces to allow contraction to take place.

Dilation of the voids causes negative water pressures that draw fluid into the pores, and contraction of the voids causes positive pore pressures to push the water out of the pores. If the rate of shearing is very large compared to the rate that water can be sucked into or squeezed out of the dilating or contracting pore spaces, then the shearing is called &quot;undrained shear&quot;, if the shearing is slow enough that the water pressures are negligible, the shearing is called &quot;drained shear&quot;. During undrained shear, the water pressure u changes depending on volume change tendencies. From the effective stress equation, the change in u directly effects the effective stress by the equation:

:formula_49

and the strength is very sensitive to the effective stress. It follows then that the undrained shear strength of a soil may be smaller or larger than the drained shear strength depending upon whether the soil is contractive or dilative.

===Shear tests===
Strength parameters can be measured in the laboratory using direct shear test, triaxial shear test, simple shear test, fall cone test and (hand) shear vane test; there are numerous other devices and variations on these devices used in practice today. Tests conducted to characterize the strength and stiffness of the soils in the ground include the Cone penetration test and the Standard penetration test.

===Other factors===
The stress–strain relationship of soils, and therefore the shearing strength, is affected by:

# &quot;soil composition&quot; (basic soil material): mineralogy, grain size and grain size distribution, shape of particles, pore fluid type and content, ions on grain and in pore fluid.
# &quot;state&quot; (initial): Defined by the initial void ratio, effective normal stress and shear stress (stress history). State can be describd by terms such as: loose, dense, overconsolidated, normally consolidated, stiff, soft, contractive, dilative, etc.
# &quot;structure&quot;: Refers to the arrangement of particles within the soil mass; the manner in which the particles are packed or distributed. Features such as layers, joints, fissures, slickensides, voids, pockets, cementation, etc., are part of the structure. Structure of soils is described by terms such as: undisturbed, disturbed, remolded, compacted, cemented; flocculent, honey-combed, single-grained; flocculated, deflocculated; stratified, layered, laminated; isotropic and anisotropic.
# &quot;Loading conditions&quot;: Effective stress path - drained, undrained, and type of loading - magnitude, rate (static, dynamic), and time history (monotonic, cyclic).

==Applications==

===Lateral earth pressure===

Lateral earth stress theory is used to estimate the amount of stress soil can exert perpendicular to gravity. This is the stress exerted on retaining walls. A lateral earth stress coefficient, K, is defined as the ratio of lateral (horizontal) effective stress to vertical effective stress for cohesionless soils (K=σ&#x27;h/σ&#x27;v). There are three coefficients: at-rest, active, and passive. At-rest stress is the lateral stress in the ground before any disturbance takes place. The active stress state is reached when a wall moves away from the soil under the influence of lateral stress, and results from shear failure due to reduction of lateral stress. The passive stress state is reached when a wall is pushed into the soil far enough to cause shear failure within the mass due to increase of lateral stress. There are many theories for estimating lateral earth stress; some are empirically based, and some are analytically derived.

===Bearing capacity===

The bearing capacity of soil is the average contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. Allowable bearing stress is the bearing capacity divided by a factor of safety. Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements.

===Slope stability===
The field of slope stability encompasses the analysis of static and dynamic stability of slopes of earth and rock-fill dams, slopes of other types of embankments, excavated slopes, and natural slopes in soil and soft rock.

As seen to the right, earthen slopes can develop a cut-spherical weakness zone. The probability of this happening can be calculated in advance using a simple 2-D circular analysis package. A primary difficulty with analysis is locating the most-probable slip plane for any given situation. Many landslides have been analyzed only after the fact. Landslides vs. Rock strength are two factors for consideration.

==Recent developments==
A recent finding in soil mechanics is that soil deformation can be described as the behavior of a dynamical system. This approach to soil mechanics is referred to as Dynamical Systems based Soil Mechanics (DSSM). DSSM holds simply that soil deformation is a Poisson process in which particles move to their final position at random shear strains.

The basis of DSSM is that soils (including sands) can be sheared till they reach a steady-state condition at which, under conditions of constant strain-rate, there is no change in shear stress, effective confining stress, and void ratio. The steady-state was formally defined by Steve J. Poulos an associate professor at the Soil Mechanics Department of Harvard University, who built off a hypothesis that Arthur Casagrande was formulating towards the end of his career. The steady state condition is not the same as the &quot;critical state&quot; condition. It differs from the critical state in that it specifies a statistically constant structure at the steady state. The steady-state values are also very slightly dependent on the strain-rate.

Many systems in nature reach steady states, and dynamical systems theory describes such systems. Soil shear can also be described as a dynamical system. The physical basis of the soil shear dynamical system is a Poisson process in which particles move to the steady-state at random shear strains. Joseph generalized this—particles move to their final position (not just steady-state) at random shear-strains. Because of its origins in the steady state concept, DSSM is sometimes informally called &quot;Harvard soil mechanics.&quot;

DSSM provides for very close fits to stress–strain curves, including for sands. Because it tracks conditions on the failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories are not able to do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with the log of the overconsolidation ratio and why stress–strain curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant for a wide range of soils.

<doc id="1276442" wikidata="Q4970923" url="?curid=1276442" title="British Rail D0260">
<text>D0260, named Lion, was a prototype Type 4 mainline diesel-electric locomotive built in 1962 by a consortium of Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, Sulzer the engine maker and Associated Electrical Industries, at BRCW&#x27;s Smethwick works near Birmingham.

The locomotive&#x27;s number was derived from its works number, DEL260.

==Specification==
&quot;Lion&quot; was a private venture to meet a requirement from British Railways for a powerful locomotive of Co-Co wheel arrangement, as a substitute for the earlier 1Co-Co1 locomotives such as the &quot;Peak&quot; classes. The specifications were revealed by the British Transport Commission (BTC) at a meeting on 15 January 1960. Train heating was to be by both steam and electric train heating (ETH). Unlike the earlier Pilot Scheme, the BTC expected that these prototypes would be funded by the makers, rather than bulk orders being placed sight-unseen. For the Type 4, that gave rise to three prototypes: &quot;Falcon&quot;, DP2 and &quot;Lion&quot;, the latter two leading to the Class 50 and Class 47.

&quot;Lion&quot; used a more powerful development of the same engine as the Class 44 &quot;Peak&quot;s, but lighter overall and with a more reliable bogie design. It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with a twin-bank Sulzer 12LDA28C engine of . It was a development of the 12LDA28A used for the &quot;Peak&quot;s. At that time, the Sulzer engines were favoured over English Electric&#x27;s V12 option, despite their greater cost of £45,000 vs. £26,000, and their weight of 22.3 tons vs 19.4 tons.

The locomotive had a design maximum speed of and weight of . The design dimensions of both &quot;Lion&quot; and the Class 47 were the same, although the Class 47 ended up a few tons overweight.

== Construction ==
=== Body ===
&quot;Lion&#x27;s&quot; overall construction was as a truss from bufferbeam to bufferbeam, using the full height of the body to cant rail level as the structure. It was built from welded thin steel sheet, as either sheet or pressings. This gave a structure which was stiff and strong, yet avoided the weight of heavy underfloor girder sections. Truss structures had been used previously for the &quot;Peaks&quot;, although with the channel underframe as well, but these had been the diagonally-braced Pratt truss, which limited access through the sides and made access for maintenance difficult, often requiring an overhead crane. &quot;Lion&quot; used the uncommon Vierendeel truss, which is characterised by its rectangular openings. Although an inefficient structure for bridges, owing to the restricted bracing, the openings allowed better access through the body sides and &quot;Lion&quot; had central access doors for servicing. The driver&#x27;s doors were also openings in the truss, which could extend to the full length of the bodyshell and cabs.

Engine cooling was performed entirely in the roof section above the cant rail, explaining the lack of large cooling grilles in the body sides. The cooling group was provided by Serck and used two radiators in a removable pack in the roof over the Nº1 end and the Spanner Swirlyflow steam heating boiler. Air was drawn in from the sides, through the panels, and exhausted upwards in the centre by two electric fans. The main roof section, above the engine, was unusual in that it was a translucent fibreglass moulding, which provided light into the engine room, despite the body&#x27;s small windows. This lightweight moulding could be raised upwards by pneumatic cylinders when stationary, to act as an air vent before needing access to the engine. The roof could then be slid lengthways, allowing fairly major engine servicing such as piston replacement, without needing a large overhead crane to remove a metal roof. The oil-wetted engine air filters were also mounted in the roof section, leaving more space in the body.

The external styling, particularly the cab design and its fibreglass roof panels, resembled the Class 35 &quot;Hymek&quot;s, as they shared the same designer. The outer cladding skin was a load-bearing steel sheet. As such skins otherwise tended to show uneven ripples, &quot;Lion&quot; had this stiffened by five lengthwise fluted ribs. The livery stood out from other locomotives, although also showed dirt, as it was painted white overall with the side ribs picked out in gold.

==Testing==
BR tested it initially on Western Region services out of London Paddington based at Wolverhampton Stafford Road Shed. Later it moved to Finsbury Park on the Eastern Region for services London King&#x27;s Cross. However, BR decided to purchase its new Type 4 fleet from Brush Traction (the Class 47) and so D0260 was withdrawn in February 1964.

==Disposal==

Full details of &quot;Lion&#x27;s&quot; final withdrawal have never been fully made public, and even the BRC&amp;W workforce were not informed of its fate. But at some time after withdrawal, &quot;Lion&quot; was moved to AEI&#x27;s works at Attercliffe where AEI became responsible for stripping the locomotive, primarily to recover their electrical components. During this process Sulzer recovered their 12LDA28C power unit and radiators (the engine was sent to be reconditioned at Vickers in Barrow-in-Furness, and was subsequently installed into an unknown production Class 47). What remained, principally the body shell and bogies, were scrapped at the Attercliffe yard of scrap merchant Thos. W. Ward. The date on which Ward finally cut up the remains is unclear. One report puts it as late as 1965.

== Models ==

D0260 &quot;Lion&quot; available as a kit and ready-to-run in 00 gauge by Silver Fox Models.

There is now a limited edition, of 4,000, 00 gauge model of &quot;Lion&quot; in its white livery produced by Heljan.

<text>Vaishno Devi (also known as Mata Rani, Trikuta, Ambe and Vaishnavi) is a manifestation of the Hindu mother goddess Durga in some beliefs; in others, she is a manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi. Vaishno Devi is worshipped as a combined avatar of the goddesses Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, and Mahasarasvati.

== Origin ==
=== Purāṇa ===
According to Dēvī Mahābhāgavata Purāṇa, she is mentioned as &quot;Viṣṇupriyā&quot;.

In the Varāha Purāṇa&#x27;s Triśakti Māhātmya, she originated from Trikalā (the goddess who was born from Trimūrtis) and slayed an asura called Mahiṣāsura on Śataśṛṅga Parvata where the current Trikūṭa Dhāma of Vaiṣṇōdēvī is situated.

=== Pāñcarātra ===
The Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa Saṃhitā&#x27;s Kṛtayuga Santāna and Dvāparayuga Santāna calls her &quot;Māṇikī&quot;, the Śakti of Kalki, as she resides on Māṇika Parvata (another name of Trikūṭa). 

==Pilgrimage route==
Professor and author Manohar Sajnani says, According to Hindu beliefs, the original abode of Vaishno Devi was Ardha Kunwari, a place about halfway between Katra town and the cave. She meditated in the cave for 9 months just like how a baby stays in its mother&#x27;s womb for 9 months. It is said that when Bhairav Nath ran after Vaishno Devi to catch her. The Devi reached near a cave in the hill, she called up Hanuman and told him that &quot;I would do penance in this cave for nine months, till then you should not allow Bhairav Nath to enter the cave.&quot; Hanuman obeyed the mother&#x27;s orders. Bhairavnath was kept outside this cave and today this holy cave is known as &#x27;Ardha Kunwari&#x27;.

==Temple==
The Vaishno Devi Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the godden located in Katra at the Trikuta Mountains within Jammu and Kashmir. The Shakta tradition considered it as one of the 108 Shakti Peethas dedicated to goddess Durga. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India. Every year millions of visitors visit the temple. During festivals like Navaratri, the count increases to ten million (one crore) visitors. Vaishno Devi Temple is one of the richest temples in India. Authors Michael Barnett and Janice Gross Stein say, &quot;Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine in Jammu has an annual income of about $16 million, mainly from offerings by devotees&quot;.

The temple is considered sacred by all Hindus. Many prominent saints such as Vivekananda have visited the temple.

<doc id="1276456" wikidata="Q513145" url="?curid=1276456" title="Tokushima Vortis">
<text>is a Japanese professional football club located in Tokushima, capital of Tokushima Prefecture. The club currently playing in the J2 League, the Japanese second tier of professional football league.

==Name origin==
The name, &quot;Vortis&quot; was named in 1997 (see below), and it was explained as a coinage of Italian &quot;Vortice&quot; (meaning whirlpool, after the famous Naruto whirlpool in Naruto Strait). The name was chosen to exhibit the dynamics of a whirlpool in the hope of swallowing up the whole audience in excitement by its power, speed and unity.

==History==
Founded in 1955 as &quot;Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Soccer Club&quot;, VORTIS joined the J-League in 2005. They are still sponsored by Otsuka&#x27;s best-known brand, Pocari Sweat sports drink.

They were first promoted to the old Japan Soccer League Division 2 in 1989, but the company&#x27;s reluctance to professionalize the team forced it to compete in the former JFL and current JFL. In the 1997 old JFL season, they first sported a &quot;Vortis Tokushima&quot; name, but the lack of fan interest at the time forced them to go back to the corporate identity. They finally adopted the &quot;Tokushima Vortis&quot; name for good after winning the new JFL championship in 2004 and being promoted.

The first season in J2 was naturally a difficult one for Vortis, but they surprised many sceptics with their determination and quality of play. The team rose as high as fourth place, at one point, before slipping down the table later in the season to finish ninth. In 2006, the team was forced to rebuild, as the players who took the team into the J.League began to hit the ceiling of their abilities and made way for younger replacements. As a result, despite the encouragement of a local rivalry with Ehime FC, Tokushima drifted down-table, and they followed it up with a last-place finish in 2007 and 2008.

In 2013, they earned fourth place in J2, matching the same placement they had two years before in the division and twenty years before in the old JFL Division 1; this time they won the playoff, defeating Kyoto Sanga F.C. in the final round at the National Stadium in Tokyo, thus becoming the first professional Shikoku football club to compete in the top division of their national league.

Until their promotion, they were the only former JSL member currently a member of the J.League which has never competed in the top tier of Japanese football. With promotion and the creation of the J3 League in 2014, the distinction was taken over by Blaublitz Akita.

In the 2019 season, they finished 4th again and were one win away from a return to J1 in the playoffs, but ultimately failed to beat Shonan Bellmare away in the final game. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, they did one better and were promoted as J2 champions.

<doc id="1276460" wikidata="Q1195445" url="?curid=1276460" title="Sacred Heart Cathedral (Guangzhou)">
<text>The Sacred Heart Cathedral, properly the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and also known as the Stone Chamber or Stone House by locals, is a Gothic Revival Roman Catholic cathedral in Guangzhou, China. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Guangzhou. The cathedral is located at 56 Yide Road (in Chinese: 一德路56号), on the north bank of the Pearl River at the heart of the old district. It is one of the few cathedrals in the world to be entirely built of granite, including all the walls, pillars, and the twin towers.

== History ==
The site of the cathedral was originally the residence of the Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces in the Qing dynasty. During the Second Opium War, the residence was completely destroyed and Viceroy Ye Mingchen was captured by the British.

Based on the terms of an imperial edict issued by the Daoguang Emperor in February 1846, which promised compensation for churches destroyed and properties taken from the mission, the Société des Missions Étrangères de Paris obtained the site by signing an agreement with the Qing government on January 25, 1861. In his decree of approval, the Xianfeng Emperor wrote &quot;from now on, war should be stopped and peace be sincerely kept forever&quot;.

With financial support from Napoleon III and donations from French Catholics, Bishop Philippe François Zéphirin Guillemin, M.E.P. (), the first vicar apostolic of Guangdong, oversaw the construction project. A French architect from Nancy, Léon Vautrin, was asked to design the cathedral, in collaboration with Charles Hyacinthe Humbert, also from Nancy. Humbert and another architect from Paris, Antoine Hermitte, who succeeds him at a later time, both travelled to China to oversee the construction of the cathedral. Bishop Guillemin did not get to see completion of the cathedral, as he died at the age of 72 in Paris in 1886, two years before the cathedral was finished. The construction was supervised by his successor, Bishop Augustin Chausse, M.E.P. ().

== Construction ==

Construction of the foundation began on June 28, 1861, the Feast of the Sacred Heart, and concluded in 1863. On December 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, with surrounding Chinese houses and streets decorated, a grand ceremony was held, attended by the Viceroy of Liangguang, all senior Mandarins, a detachment of 300 Manchu troops, all consuls in Canton as well as the missionaries and a score of priests. The bishop and the consul of France, Baron Gilbert de Trenqualye, delivered speeches. Two foundation stones were blessed and laid. The words &quot;Jerusalem 1863&quot; were engraved on the east one and &quot;Roma 1863&quot; on the west one, in reference to the Catholic Church&#x27;s origin in Jerusalem in the east and headed on Earth by the Pope in Rome in the west. One kilogram of soil taken from Rome and one stone from Jerusalem were laid under the respective foundation stones.

The construction of the cathedral turned out to be very challenging, mostly because of its all-granite structure and the lack of machinery, which meant the cathedral had to be built by hand. None of the Chinese workers at that time had seen a western cathedral before, not to mention had any experience of building one. Communication was another major problem when the French and the Chinese didn&#x27;t speak each other&#x27;s languages. The construction progress was slow for the first few years. Eventually the French employed a Chinese man named Cai Xiao () from Jiexi County as foreman. Cai had many years of experience in building stone houses in his hometown, which enabled him to bring in a lot of unique and creative methods. He barely left the site since being employed. The construction of the cathedral took most of his youth but was able to be finished in his lifetime.

The cathedral was mostly funded by Napoleon III. When bishop Guillemin met him in Paris in 1858, the emperor, urged by his wife Eugénie, offered a personal grant of 500,000 francs. In 1873, a bill was passed in the National Assembly of France with 491 ayes against 100 nays, allocating another 75,000 francs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be used on the cathedral.

The cathedral was finished in 1888 after 25 years of construction.

== Architecture ==

The façade of the cathedral was modelled on the Basilica of St. Clotilde in Paris and its nave and apse were inspired by the Toul Cathedral. The cathedral features a nave of 28.2 metres high, flanked by two lower aisles and 14 small side-chapels. With a floor area of 2,924 square metres, it is the largest Roman Catholic church in the Guangzhou archdiocese and the largest cathedral in the Gothic style in China and Southeast Asia. The cathedral is 32.85 metres wide, 77.17 metres long, and the twin towers rise 52.76 metres high. The west tower is a clock tower while the east tower serves as a bell tower, inside which there used to be five large bells shipped in from France in the 19th century, although nowadays only four remain as one was given to a local church in Guangxi province in the early 1980s.

The cathedral, like most of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, is built of solid masonry. It is one of the few churches in the world to be entirely built of granite, including all the walls, pillars and the twin towers. The stones were extracted from the quarries of the Four hills of Kowloon and were transported from Kowloon, Hong Kong by sailing ships.

== Repairs ==
Since its completion in 1888, the cathedral has undergone three major repairs. The first time was in the 1920s and 1930s, when then Bishop Antoine-Pierre-Jean Fourquet, M.E.P. (), replaced the timber roof, beams and steel staircases with concrete ones. A second repair took place after the Cultural Revolution in the 1980s. Recently between 2004 and 2006 the largest repair works were carried out. The church paid ¥3 million and local Catholics donated about ¥2 million for the ¥26 million project, while the rest was covered by the local government. The aim of the restoration was to solve the problem of leakage by rebuilding the whole roof, which was the most challenging task as the rib vault below needed to remain untouched and intact. Most of 19th century stained glass was damaged during wartime and smashed in the Cultural Revolution, so new stained glass was ordered from a Philippine company specialising in church glass. It resulted in the new stained glass carrying English descriptions instead of Latin and French texts of the original French glass. New lighting, audio and CCTV systems were also installed. The original French mechanical clock has long gone, so a new 750,000-yuan clock tailored for the clock tower was ordered from a Chinese clock factory.

<text>The Julekalender (The Christmas Calendar) is a &quot;julekalender&quot; that originally aired in Christmas 1991. A Norwegian version was made in 1994, and a Finnish version appeared in 1997. It was written and performed almost entirely by a trio of Danish comedy musicians called De Nattergale with financial and technical assistance from TV2, a Danish television company. It was hugely successful at the time, causing many invented phrases from the series to enter popular culture and was later released on VHS and subsequently DVD.

It consisted of 24 episodes (one for each day of December until Christmas Eve), as has been typical for most other TV &quot;Christmas calendars&quot; before and since The Julekalender.

==Plot==
The premise of the show is fairly simple: long, long ago, the race of Nisser lived happily in Denmark getting up to mischief with the humans, drinking, and making merry. Then the &quot;Nå-såere&quot; came - evil, vampire-esque creatures with an unhealthy obsession for money and counting - and almost eradicated the Nisser. A few Nisser survived and escaped to America, among them good old &quot;Gammelnok&quot; (literally, &quot;old enough&quot;, the one character not to be played by a member of De Nattergale), who is now on the brink of death, as the music box that plays his life tune needs to be wound up.

&quot;Gammelnok&quot; gathers three of the remaining Nisser (Hansi, Günther, and Fritz (all distinctly German names)) and sends them off to Denmark, to find the old Nisse cave where the key to wind up the music box is. He gives them &quot;The Big Book&quot; to take with them, an ancient tome that contains the answer to any and all questions, warning them to take great care that it does not fall into the hands of a Nå-såer. If this were to happen, all would be lost. They are also warned to take care, as the Nå-såere nowadays have taken the appearance of normal humans, but when they consume alcohol, they regain their original appearance, with fangs, and thick-rimmed glasses. The three merrily set off, and this is where the first episode begins.

One of the quirks of the series, and one which made up a good share of its appeal, is the strange language that the Nisser speak. They themselves call it English, but it is an odd mixture of both Danish and English vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure, leading to some very humorous phrases and structures (at least, to anyone who speaks both English and Danish). This was likely a good-natured jest at the heavy Danish accent that many Danes speak with, and the (back then) fairly low level of English proficiency of Danes, especially outside of large cities. Examples of particularly interesting, odd, or funny phrases are listed here (without an understanding of Danish, the humour will likely be lost):

*&quot;He who first gets to the mill is he who first gets painted&quot;
*&quot;Think you da lige a little about&quot;
*&quot;Let us straks try to smake it!&quot;
*&quot;That is der simpelthen overhead not noget to do with&quot;

Additionally, key characters, events, or items are also called by odd hybrid names: the music box, for example, is a &quot;play dåse&quot;, Father Christmas is &quot;the Christmas man&quot; and the act of wood-carving is called &quot;snitting&quot;. Since De Nattergale are actually musicians (albeit comedy musicians), the Nisser often burst into song, or find excuses to work music into each episode.

Another large part of the appeal are the highly stereotypical Danes that the same three actors also play: Oluf and Gertrud Sand, a country bumpkin couple that live and work on a potato farm in Jutland, and Benny Jensen, a travelling salesman (or so he claims) from Copenhagen (who turns out to be a Nå-såer). Oluf and Gertrud speak with a broad country dialect, often leading to Benny misunderstanding what they say. There is also a large clash between the two different ways of life (as Benny comes to move in with Oluf and Gertrud in an early episode, as his car runs out of petrol, punctures, breaks down completely, and then gets stolen, supposedly by the &quot;Polish Mafia&quot;). Benny also thinks Oluf&#x27;s father&#x27;s name, Anders Sand, is funny, because it closely resembles Anders And, the Danish name for Donald Duck.

==Characters==
*Oluf Sand (Viggo Sommer) is a potato farmer who lives on a farm in Jutland with his wife Gertrud. He doesn&#x27;t say much, and enjoys reading the newspaper in his armchair while smoking his pipe. He often receives a call from someone (possibly the same person each time) who wants to buy potatoes, which Oluf often increases the price of and advises that a receipt is no use. He often breaks the fourth wall, remarking on the peace and quiet when Gertrud leaves, but when Benny Jensen insults her he is very quick to defend her. His Christmas wishes, according to Gertrud, never seems to be renewed, meaning that he wishes for a smoking pipe, tobacco or a pipe-cleaner. He has a father named Anders Sand, which Benny finds humorous as it sounds much like Anders And - Donald Duck&#x27;s Danish name. He secretly saves money enough to buy a &#x27;food-processor&#x27; for Gertrud, but tells her that they can&#x27;t afford it. For Christmas he receives a smoking pipe from Gertrud.
*Gertrud Sand (Carsten Knudsen) is Oluf&#x27;s wife. She is rather loud, often talking non-stop about how nice everything would be if this or that were different. She spends the entire series asking for &quot;the big crate with Christmas stuff. She also spends most episodes talking about her wish for a food-processor, but is told that they can&#x27;t afford it. When Oluf doesn&#x27;t listen to what she says she shakes her head, while breaking the fourth wall. When Oluf talks in the telephone about his potato-selling, Gertrud is told that it was wrong number when she asks. When she accidentally gives The Book away to some scouts for charity, she is confronted by Benny Jensen who screams and yells at her. She has a sister (known simply as &quot;Sister&quot;) and a brother-in-law named Kaj. When her sister calls her on the telephone she can talk for hours. She likes to listen to the radio. For Christmas she receives a foodprocessor from Oluf.
*Benny Jensen (Uffe Rørbæk Madsen) is a nåsåer who has taken the appearance of a human and visits the Sands. He claims that his car has run out of petrol, soon punctures, later breaks down completely, and then gets stolen, supposedly by the &quot;Polish Mafia&quot; (which is doubtful), and he comes to live with the farmers for the rest of the series, searching for nisse-life. He soon finds out about a cave in which three nisser lives in and spends the rest of the series making excuses to leave in order to find the cave. When he finally manages to make his way inside, knock out Günther, the youngest nisse, and steal The Big Book. After that he spends all the time reading the book at Sands, making the life a menace to the humans and the nisser. He angers when the book disappears, yelling at Gertrud. He gets pressed into taking alcohol when he claims it&#x27;s his birthday and after that he can&#x27;t stop it again. He never manages, however being close, to kill the nisser. For Christmas he receives a book about nisser from Oluf and Gertrud, having made many nisse-related references.
*Gynter (Carsten Knudsen) is a nisse who spends the majority of the series carving a new propeller for their plane after the last one broke.
*Hansi (Uffe Rørbæk Madsen) is a nisse who does most of the work for the trio. He has a running gag of asking why he has to do all the work, to which Fritz replies &quot;Because you&#x27;re the one with the biggest teeth and the ugliest clothes&quot; which because of the mixed language is actually spoken as &quot;Because you&#x27;re the one with the biggest tænder and the grimmest&#x27; tøj&quot;.
*Fritz (Viggo Sommer) is the apparent leader of the trio of nisser.

==Soundtrack==

In 1991 the same year &quot;The Julekalender&quot; was made and shown first time, a music album was published called &quot;Songs From The Julekalender&quot; which have all the songs from &quot;The Julekalender&quot; in it.

<text>Michèle Hélène Raymonde Mouton (born 23 June 1951) is a French former rally driver. Competing in the World Rally Championship for the Audi factory team, she took four victories and finished runner-up in the drivers&#x27; world championship in 1982.

Mouton debuted in rallying as a co-driver but quickly moved to the driver&#x27;s seat, steering an Alpine-Renault A110 in national rallies. In 1975, she competed in circuit racing and won the two-litre prototype class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. After being signed by Fiat France for 1977, Mouton finished runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the European Rally Championship. She went on to win the 1978 Tour de France Automobile and record consistent results in her home events in the WRC; the Tour de Corse and the Monte Carlo Rally. For 1981, Audi Sport signed Mouton to partner Hannu Mikkola. In her first year with the Audi Quattro, she took a surprise victory at the Rallye Sanremo.

In the 1982 World Rally season, Mouton finished a close second overall to Walter Röhrl, after wins in Portugal, Brazil and Greece, and helped Audi to its first manufacturers&#x27; title. Her campaign the following year resulted in fifth place. With the team having four top drivers for 1984, Mouton&#x27;s participation on world championship level became part-time. In 1985, she won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, setting a record time in the process. In 1986, she moved to Peugeot and won the German Rally Championship as the first female driver to win a major championship in rallying. Soon after securing the title, Mouton retired from rallying due to the ban of Group B rally. In 1988, she co-founded the international motorsport event Race of Champions in memory of her former rival Henri Toivonen. Mouton became the first president of the FIA&#x27;s Women &amp; Motor Sport Commission in 2010 and the FIA&#x27;s manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011.

==Career==

===Early life and career===

Michèle Mouton was born 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a town on the French Riviera, close to the mountain stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out and concentrate on a career in rallying. Although Mouton began driving her father&#x27;s Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove for him in the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. After a few more rallies, Mouton&#x27;s father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car and give her one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Rallye Paris – Saint-Raphaël Féminin and then tackled the Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.

In the World Rally Championship, Mouton made her driver debut in 1974, finishing 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110. It was rumoured her good performances were the result of a special engine, however her car passed inspection by WRC scrutineers. At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies&#x27; champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies&#x27; titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: &quot;It started to rain I remember, and I started to pass everybody. I was running on slicks. In the pits they were saying &#x27;Michele you must stop&#x27;, but I did not want to because I was passing everyone.&quot; Her results attracted a major sponsor in the form of the French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.

===Fiat===
For the 1977 season, Fiat France signed Mouton to partner Jean-Claude Andruet. She was not impressed by the handling of the Fiat 131 Abarth, stating it was &quot;like a big truck, not a car&quot; and &quot;terrible to drive&quot;. However, the car would prove successful and Mouton put in very consistent results, finishing eighth in the Tour de Corse in 1977 and fifth three years in a row from 1978 to 1980. In 1980, she had been running as high as second before her engine died for a time. In Monte Carlo, she drove the car to seventh place in 1979 and 1980, equalling the result she had achieved in the event in a Lancia Stratos HF in 1978.

Outside the World Rally Championship, Mouton drove a Porsche Carrera RS to victory in the 1977 RACE Rallye de España and to second place in the 1977 Tour de France Automobile. She also finished runner-up to Bernard Darniche in the overall European Rally Championship (ERC). Mouton went on to win the Tour de France with the 131 Abarth the following year. At the Rallye d&#x27;Antibes, she finished third behind the Stratos drivers Darniche and Attilio Bettega. She placed fifth in the ERC standings and fourth in the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) Cup for Drivers, the predecessor to the drivers&#x27; world championship. In 1979, Mouton finished second in the French Rally Championship, behind Porsche 911 SC driver Bernard Béguin.

===Audi===

====1980====
In 1980, Audi Sport, Audi&#x27;s new factory team, called Mouton and signed her for a World Rally Championship programme for the 1981 season. Mouton described Audi&#x27;s call as &quot;a complete shock&quot;. Audi&#x27;s decision to nominate her instead of established male rivals attracted a great deal of publicity. As the Audi Quattro, the first rally car to have over 300 bhp and both a turbocharger and four-wheel-drive, had not yet gained FIA homologation, Audi could only enter rallies as zero cars and not as competitive entries. Hannu Mikkola debuted the car in the Algarve Rally in October, and would have won by about thirty minutes had his times been officially registered. Mouton joined Freddy Kottulinsky for the final round of the Finnish Rally Championship, the Northern Lights, and also showed encouraging pace on the slippery surfaces. Mouton initially found the car understeering, but became more comfortable after switching to left-foot braking, as advised by Mikkola who was in charge of developing the car. Audi announced their participation in eight events in 1981, although Mouton would not be entered in the Swedish Rally due to her lack of experience on driving on ice and snow.

====1981====

Mouton&#x27;s first competitive run in the Quattro in Monte Carlo ended before it had even begun. She withdrew from the event before the start due to apparent engine problems. The team later discovered that dirt had got into the fuel system. At the Rally Portugal, she started her long partnership with the Italian co-driver Fabrizia Pons. Mouton won seven stages and took a career-best fourth place, despite suffering from electronic problems. This ended criticism of Audi for signing a female driver. After a retirement due to a broken camshaft in the Tour de Corse, Mouton set several fastest times at the Acropolis Rally in Greece. While Mikkola was leading and Mouton fifth, the stewards excluded the Quattros citing homologation infractions. Although Audi protested, the stewards upheld the decision. In her debut in the high-speed 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, Mouton found it hard to get used to the rhythm changes. She recorded a few top-ten stage times and finished 13th. She was satisfied with her performance, and the local newspaper &quot;Keskisuomalainen&quot; described her debut as successful. At the Rallye Sanremo in Italy, a mixed surface event with tarmac and gravel, Mouton took the lead when the local star Michele Cinotto crashed and held off Henri Toivonen and Ari Vatanen to take the victory. This marked the first time a female driver had won a world championship event in rallying. Mouton&#x27;s male rivals were left speechless. Earlier during the weekend, Vatanen had been confident: &quot;Never can nor will I lose to a woman.&quot; Mouton recalled her debut win in a 2008 interview for &quot;RallySport Magazine&quot;:

I remember not just because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours in front of me and no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it&#x27;s about 42 km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said &quot;OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash.&quot; And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.

In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton continued her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding off the road into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: &quot;For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, it was not easy for me because I did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much.&quot; Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers&#x27; championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers&#x27; standings.

====1982====

Mouton&#x27;s 1982 season started with a big accident at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve in the small town Briançonnet in Provence, she hit a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110 km/h (70 mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair&#x27;s injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota&#x27;s Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right by the side of the route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that something might break in my car and I can no longer avoid hitting a spectator.&quot;

In New Zealand, Mouton continued her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining the lead on stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams made it to the finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her front wheels locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.

Audi had not originally planned to participate in the African marathon events, but now found it necessary to enter the penultimate round, the Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, due to their title battles with Opel. Just before the start of the event, Mouton received news that her father had succumbed to cancer in his house in Nice. His last wish was that Mouton start the rally. After a first day of over 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of racing in temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F), she was eight minutes clear of Mikkola and nearly half an hour ahead of title rival Röhrl. Mikkola said that he had never been in such a hot car, and Röhrl estimated that the temperature inside his car reached an &quot;almost unbearable&quot; 70 °C (158 °F). With just over half of the 5,000 km (3,100 mi) behind, Mouton led from Röhrl by over an hour despite losing 25 minutes due to transmission problems. On the third day, both Mouton and Röhrl struggled with several reliability issues and her lead over Röhrl shrank to 18 minutes. The Toyota Celica GT2000s of Eklund and Waldegård were still over two hours behind. Should Mouton go on to hold off Röhrl, she would reduce Röhrl&#x27;s lead in the championship to just two points. As a driver&#x27;s seven best results counted towards the championship at the time, Mouton would only need a third place in the RAC Rally to take the title even if Röhrl would win. On the final day, she continued to suffer from mechanical problems and had the complete fuel injection system changed. For the next time control, Röhrl and Mouton arrived almost simultaneously. With only 600 km to go, Mouton went off the road and rolled her car. She drove the severely damaged Quattro for five more kilometres before giving up.

Röhrl inherited the win and became the first two-time world champion in rallying. Having lost her father, Mouton did not dwell on losing the title. Röhrl had earlier conceded that he &quot;would have accepted second place in the championship to Mikkola&quot;, but not to Mouton: &quot;This is not because I doubt her capabilities as a driver, but because she is a woman.&quot; He believed that defeat would have devalued his performances. At the RAC, Mouton edged out Toivonen to take second place behind Mikkola. This result made Audi the first German marque to win the manufacturers&#x27; world title. At the inaugural Autosport Awards gala, Mouton won the International Rally Driver of the Year award.

====1983====

The 1983 season started the Group B era of the WRC and Mouton was now at the wheel of the Audi Quattro A1. She also had a new teammate; Audi had signed Stig Blomqvist as their third regular driver. For the third year in a row, Mouton had a bad start to her season in Monte Carlo. She went off the road on a stage not far from her home town, and again hit a stone wall at over 100 km/h (60 mph). The car was destroyed, but Mouton and Pons were unharmed. Mouton explained to her team boss Roland Gumpert, later of Gumpert supercar fame, that she had to dodge a photographer. Mouton went on to record successive points finishes. She finished fourth in Sweden in a quadruple win for Audi, after an early driving error that had sent her Quattro into a snow bank. In Portugal, Mouton finished second to Mikkola, ahead of Lancia&#x27;s Röhrl and Markku Alén. After the first section of the Safari Rally, totaling over 1,600 km (1,000 mi), Mouton arrived to the finish on three wheels and said she was &quot;totally exhausted&quot; from the effort. She eventually placed third behind Opel&#x27;s Ari Vatanen and her teammate Mikkola. After four events, Mikkola and Mouton were first and second in the drivers&#x27; championship.

At the Tour de Corse, Audi debuted the Quattro A2, which was 70 kg (155 lb) lighter and had an engine producing 30 more horsepower. Mouton&#x27;s rally ended when her engine caught on fire. On the first stage in Greece, she rolled her car on a hairpin turn 18 km (11 mi) from the start. Rally New Zealand was for Mouton a repetition of the previous year; she took the lead on the seventh stage and held on to it until her A2&#x27;s engine failed, with only six of the 33 stages to go. The three retirements in a row dropped Mouton to fifth place in the championship. She then finished third behind Mikkola and Blomqvist at the Rally Argentina, but this would remain her last podium finish of the season. At the 1000 Lakes in Finland, Mouton finished the first day in seventh place after setting two top-five stage times. Her car later caught on fire, but she was able to continue in the event by following Mikkola&#x27;s advice and driving into a lake. With a string of top-ten times, she eventually finished 16th. In the Rallye Sanremo, the tarmac stages were dominated by the Lancia 037 and Mouton finished seventh after suffering from fuel injection problems. In the season-ending RAC Rally, she started well and held second place after the first twelve stages. An Audi mechanic later accidentally refilled Mouton&#x27;s fuel tank with pure water which resulted in time-consuming repairs. She eventually retired after crashing out, and placed fifth overall in the drivers&#x27; championship. Although Mikkola beat Lancia&#x27;s Röhrl and Alén to the drivers&#x27; title, Audi had lost the manufacturers&#x27; title to Lancia after the latter&#x27;s triple win in Sanremo.

====1984====

For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world champion Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton now had a part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For the first time in nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that &quot;finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From one side to the other side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!&quot; This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.

In the Safari Rally, a rotor arm in Mouton&#x27;s Quattro failed and caused the turbo to break down as well. She retired after falling victim to the team&#x27;s ranking order; as the repairs were expected to take too long, Gumpert ordered championship leader Blomqvist&#x27;s Quattro to be fixed by using Mouton&#x27;s sister car as spares. Her debut in the new Sport Quattro at the Acropolis Rally ended with engine overheating problems. In the 1000 Lakes, Mouton placed ninth after the short first day. She later crashed and continued without a windscreen, but the damage to her Quattro could not be repaired in service. Mouton retired and left Finland pointless for the fourth year in a row. In late October, she signed a contract extension with Audi. At the RAC Rally, a slight mistake led to a puncture and Mouton dropped from third to fifth. She went on to narrowly lose the final podium spot to Toyota&#x27;s Per Eklund. Mouton&#x27;s results placed her 12th in the drivers&#x27; world championship, a point behind Röhrl. Outside the WRC, Mouton debuted in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, driving an Audi Sport Quattro together with her usual co-driver Fabrizia Pons. After her main opponent Martin Schanche got hampered by a flat right front tyre she won the open rally category (now known as &quot;unlimited&quot;) in a record time and placed second overall, leaving behind several specialised V8 single-seaters that had normally dominated the race.

====1985====

Audi&#x27;s WRC programme was limited for the 1985 season due to the recent defeats to Peugeot Talbot Sport, Peugeot&#x27;s factory team headed by Jean Todt. Mouton and Mikkola were assigned to testing and development duties. She drove both the Sport Quattro and its follower, the Quattro S1 (Sport E2). Mouton considered the S1 the most difficult rally car she had driven: &quot;For rallying on asphalt, I agree the limit had gone too far. We did not have the reflexes to control it properly. It was tough to drive the car, but not the short Quattro before.&quot;
Although Mouton competed in only one world championship event during the season, she contested a full six-round British Rally Championship. Her campaign was plagued by reliability problems and she recorded only one finish. In the National Breakdown Rally, Mouton stopped after damaging her Quattro in a jump. After technical problems led to an early retirement at the Circuit of Ireland, she finished second at the Welsh Rally behind Malcolm Wilson in another Quattro. At the Scottish Rally, Mouton had been closing in on the leading Wilson until a transmission problem forced her to retire. At the Ulster Rally, she set the fastest time for the first stage but then dropped out with a mechanical failure. In the season-ending Manx International Rally, Mouton struggled to start her Quattro and then crashed out five stages later.

Mouton&#x27;s only WRC event of the year was the long-distance Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. She was co-driven by Arne Hertz as Pons was ill at the time of the start. Mouton started well and tied the lead with Toyota&#x27;s Juha Kankkunen after the first day. Her Quattro incurred severe engine problems on the next day, but was seemingly repaired by Audi mechanics off the route in the jungle. At the same time, the Sport Quattro &quot;chase car&quot;, a high-speed service car, retired and Audi faced accusations of swapping the cars. The team withdrew Mouton just before the finish and the controversy remains unresolved; the stewards did not find proof but the media published evidence afterwards. Although her rallying year was a disappointment, Mouton made a successful return to the Pikes Peak, winning the event overall in her Sport Quattro. Despite slippery conditions caused by a hailstorm, she broke Al Unser Jr.&#x27;s 1982 record by about thirteen seconds. The Frenchwoman&#x27;s win irritated some of her male rivals. Bobby Unser was reputedly quite vocal about his loss, to which Mouton is said to have replied: &quot;If you have the balls you can try to race me back down as well.&quot;

===Peugeot===

Mouton broke off her contract with Audi in late 1985 to join Peugeot for the coming season. She contested the German Rally Championship and two WRC events in a Peugeot 205 Turbo 16, with which the marque had captured the previous year&#x27;s world titles. To replace the newly-wed Pons, Mouton recruited Terry Harryman who had been left jobless after Ari Vatanen&#x27;s accident. Mouton, nicknamed &quot;der schwarze Vulkan&quot; (The Black Volcano) due to her temperament and long black hair, won six of the eight events in the German championship, including the Rallye Deutschland. Although the Hessen Rallye was stopped after the severe accident of Formula One driver Marc Surer, which claimed the life of his co-driver Michel Wyder, Mouton was declared the winner. She secured the German national title on the seventh and penultimate round, the Sachs Baltic, after taking her fifth win of the season. She became the first female driver to win a major championship in rallying.

Mouton&#x27;s WRC outings were her home events: Monte Carlo Rally and Tour de Corse. In Monte Carlo, she was running in eighth place after eleven stages, but soon retired with oil pump problems. For the Tour de Corse in May, Mouton was given the second evolution of the car. She quickly showed good pace and held third place behind Lancia&#x27;s Henri Toivonen and teammate Bruno Saby. However, she ran into gearbox trouble on the tenth stage and was forced to retire. During the next day, Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto crashed out from the lead and died in their seats. Mouton was still in Corsica and remarked to her boyfriend that &quot;if they stop the Group B now, it will be the end for me.&quot; Within days, FISA announced new regulations and banned the Group B supercars for the following year.

In October, two weeks after securing the German Rally Championship title, Mouton announced her retirement from rallying. She cited the end of the Group B era as the reason behind the decision, and stated that it was &quot;a good time to stop&quot;. Later in the same month, Mouton crowned her career by winning the last event of the German championship, the Drei-Städte-Rallye (Three Cities Rally), ahead of Armin Schwarz&#x27;s MG Metro 6R4.

===Later career===

In 1988, Mouton co-founded the international motorsport event Race of Champions with Fredrik Johnsson, in memory of Toivonen and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the world championship for rally drivers. The event originally included the world&#x27;s top rally drivers, but now features stars also from other disciplines, such as Formula One, NASCAR, Le Mans and MotoGP, competing against each other in identical cars.

In 1988 and 1989, Mouton participated in rally raids as part of Peugeot&#x27;s service team for Ari Vatanen and Jacky Ickx. At the 1988 Rally of Tunisia, Mouton drove a 205 T16 Grand Raid chase car and transported spare parts for Vatanen and Henri Pescarolo, but also classified sixth overall. She later took part in the Dakar Rally as a press driver in 2004 and 2009. In 2000, Mouton finished second in the London–Sydney Marathon driving a Porsche 911, behind former teammate Stig Blomqvist. After 22 years, Mouton and Fabrizia Pons reunited to compete in the 2008 Otago Classic Rally in New Zealand. In 2010, Mouton competed with a 911 in the Rallye du Maroc and finished second to Grégoire De Mévius.

In 2010, Mouton became the first president of the FIA&#x27;s Women &amp; Motor Sport Commission. She stated that &quot;for many years people have asked me why there have been no women following in my footsteps. I really hope the Commission can help answer that question and that we can attract and support women in all areas of our sport.&quot; Having already headed a working group on the future of rallying, Mouton was appointed FIA&#x27;s manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011. Mouton also serves in the nomination committee of the Rally Hall of Fame. In March 2012, she recused herself after becoming a candidate for nomination. Mouton was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with two-time world champion Carlos Sainz.

==Personal life and legacy==

While announcing her retirement from rallying, Mouton stated her intention to start a family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre&#x27;s support as the secret for her success: &quot;He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too.&quot;

Mouton states that in her mind she did not try to beat her male rivals, but to be at their level. She noted that in rallying, time is the most important thing. David Evans of &quot;Autosport&quot; described her as &quot;motorsport&#x27;s most successful ever female driver&quot;. Rally journalist and historian Graham Robson credits Mouton, along with Pat Moss, as &quot;the driver by whom all other females measure their skills and achievements&quot;. Mouton and Moss were of different eras and did not compete directly against each other, although they both appeared at the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally where Mouton co-drove. In 1985, they swapped cars in a private test session with Moss driving the Quattro and Mouton an Austin-Healey 3000. Stirling Moss regarded Mouton as &quot;one of the best&quot;, and Niki Lauda described her as a &quot;superwoman&quot;.

In 2011, Mouton was made knight of the Legion of Honour (&quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;) by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. At the 50th International Emmy Awards in 2022, the documentary &quot;Queen of Speed&quot; about Mouton&#x27;s rise to the top of rallying in the 1980s was awarded an Emmy for the Best Sports Documentary.

In 2024, Mouton was awarded the first ever FIA lifetime achievement award.

<text>Slope stability refers to the condition of inclined soil or rock slopes to withstand or undergo movement; the opposite condition is called slope instability or slope failure. The stability condition of slopes is a subject of study and research in soil mechanics, geotechnical engineering, and engineering geology. Analyses are generally aimed at understanding the causes of an occurred slope failure, or the factors that can potentially trigger a slope movement, resulting in a landslide, as well as at preventing the initiation of such movement, slowing it down or arresting it through mitigation countermeasures.

The stability of a slope is essentially controlled by the ratio between the available shear strength and the acting shear stress, which can be expressed in terms of a safety factor if these quantities are integrated over a potential (or actual) sliding surface. A slope can be globally stable if the safety factor, computed along any potential sliding surface running from the top of the slope to its toe, is always larger than 1. The smallest value of the safety factor will be taken as representing the global stability condition of the slope. Similarly, a slope can be locally stable if a safety factor larger than 1 is computed along any potential sliding surface running through a limited portion of the slope (for instance only within its toe). Values of the global or local safety factors close to 1 (typically comprised between 1 and 1.3, depending on regulations) indicate marginally stable slopes that require attention, monitoring and/or an engineering intervention (slope stabilization) to increase the safety factor and reduce the probability of a slope movement.

A previously stable slope can be affected by a number of predisposing factors or processes that make the safety factor decrease - either by increasing the shear stress or by decreasing the shear strength - and can ultimately result in slope failure. Factors that can trigger slope failure include hydrologic events (such as intense or prolonged rainfall, rapid snowmelt, progressive soil saturation, increase of water pressure within the slope), earthquakes (including aftershocks), internal erosion (piping), surface or toe erosion, artificial slope loading (for instance due to the construction of a building), slope cutting (for instance to make space for roadways, railways, or buildings), or slope flooding (for instance by filling an artificial lake after damming a river).

== Examples ==
Earthen slopes can develop a cut-spherical weakness area. The probability of this happening can be calculated in advance using a simple 2-D circular analysis package. A primary difficulty with analysis is locating the most-probable slip plane for any given situation. Many landslides have only been analyzed after the fact. More recently slope stability radar technology has been employed, particularly in the mining industry, to gather real-time data and assist in determining the likelihood of slope failure.

Real-life failures in naturally deposited mixed soils are not necessarily circular but, prior to computers, it was far easier to analyze such a simplified geometry. Nevertheless, failures in &#x27;pure&#x27; clay can be quite close to circular. Such slips often occur after a period of heavy rain, when the pore water pressure at the slip surface increases, reducing the effective normal stress and thus diminishing the restraining friction along the slip line. This is combined with increased soil weight due to the added groundwater. A &#x27;shrinkage&#x27; crack (formed during prior dry weather) at the top of the slip may also fill with rain water, pushing the slip forward. At the other extreme, slab-shaped slips on hillsides can remove a layer of soil from the top of the underlying bedrock. Again, this is usually initiated by heavy rain, sometimes combined with increased loading from new buildings or removal of support at the toe (resulting from road widening or other construction work). Stability can thus be significantly improved by installing drainage paths to reduce the destabilizing forces. Once the slip has occurred, however, a weakness along the slip circle remains, which may then recur at the next monsoon.

==Angle of repose==
The angle of repose is related to the shear strength of geologic materials, which is relevant in construction and engineering contexts. For granular materials, the size and shape of grains can impact angle of repose significantly. As the roundness of materials increases, the angle of repose decreases since there is less friction between the soil grains.

When the angle of repose is exceeded, mass wasting and rockfall can occur. It is important for many civil and geotechnical engineers to know the angle of repose to avoid structural and natural disasters. As a result, the application of retaining walls can help to retain soil so that the angle of repose is not exceeded.

The angle of repose and the stability of a slope are impacted by climatic and non-climatic factors.

===Water content===
Water content is an important parameter that could change the angle of repose. Reportedly, a higher water content can stabilize a slope and increase the angle of repose. However, water saturation can result in a decrease in the slope&#x27;s stability since it acts as a lubricant and creates a detachment where mass wasting can occur.

Water content is dependent on soil properties such as grain size, which can impact infiltration rate, runoff, and water retention. Generally, finer-grained soils rich in clay and silt retain more water than coarser sandy soils. This effect is mainly due to capillary action, where the adhesive forces between the fluid, particle, and the cohesive forces of the fluid itself counteract gravitational pull. Therefore, smaller grain size results in a smaller surface area on which gravitational forces can act. Smaller surface area also leads to more capillary action, more water retention, more infiltration, and less runoff.

===Vegetation===
The presence of vegetation does not directly impact the angle of repose, but it acts as a stabilizing factor in a hillslope, where the tree roots anchor into deeper soil layers and form a fiber‐reinforced soil composite with a higher shear resistance (mechanical cohesion).

===Roundness of grains===
The shape of the grain can have an impact on the angle of repose and the stability of the slope. The more rounded the grain is, the lower the angle of repose. A decrease in roundness, or an increase in angularity, results in interlocking via particle contact. This linear relationship between the angle of repose and the roundness of grain can also be used as a predictor of the angle of repose if the roundness of the grain is measured.

==Slope stabilization==
Since the stability of the slope can be impacted by external events such as precipitation, an important concern in civil/geotechnical engineering is the stabilization of slopes.

===Application of vegetation===
The application of vegetation to increase the slope stability against erosion and landslide is a form of bioengineering that is widely used in areas where the landslide depth is shallow. Vegetation increases the stability of the slope mechanically, by reinforcing the soils through plant roots, which stabilize the upper part of the soil. Vegetation also stabilizes the slope via hydrologic processes, by the reduction of soil moisture content through the interception of precipitation and transpiration. This results in a drier soil that is less susceptible to mass wasting.

Stability of slopes can also be improved by:
* Flattening of slopes results in reduction in weight which makes the slope more stable
* Soil stabilization
* Providing lateral supports by piles or retaining walls
* Grouting or cement injections into specific zones
* Consolidation by surcharging or electro osmosis increases the stability of slope

==Analysis methods==
==Mass classification and rating==
Various classification and rating systems exist for the design of slopes and to assess the stability of slopes. The systems are based on empirical relations between rock mass parameters and various slope parameters such as height and slope dip.

==Probability classification==
The slope stability probability classification (SSPC) system is a rock mass classification system for slope engineering and slope stability assessment. The system is a three-step classification: &quot;‘exposure’&quot;, &quot;‘reference’&quot;, and &quot;‘slope’&quot; rock mass classification with conversion factors between the three steps depending on existing and future weathering and depending on the damage incurred by excavation. The stability of a slope is expressed as the probability of different failure mechanisms.

A rock mass is classified following a standardized set of criteria in one or more exposures (&quot;‘exposure’&quot; classification). These values are converted per exposure to a &quot;‘reference’&quot; rock mass, compensating for the degree of weathering in the exposure and excavation damage. A new slope can then be designed in the &quot;‘reference’&quot; rock mass with compensation anticipating further damage due to excavation and future weathering. If an existing slope&#x27;s stability is assessed, the &quot;‘exposure’&quot; and &quot;‘slope’&quot; rock mass values are the same.

The failure mechanisms are divided into &quot;orientation dependent&quot; and &quot;orientation independent&quot;. Orientation dependent failure mechanisms depend on the orientation of the slope to the discontinuities in the rock mass, i.e., sliding (plane and wedge sliding) and toppling failure. Orientation independence relates to the possibility that a slope fails independently from its orientation, e.g., circular failure entirely through newly formed discontinuities in intact rock blocks or failing partially following existing and partially new discontinuities.

In addition, the shear strength along a discontinuity (&#x27;sliding criterion&#x27;) and &#x27;rock mass cohesion&#x27; and &#x27;rock mass friction&#x27; can be determined. The system has been used directly or modified in various geology and climate environments worldwide. The system has been modified for slope stability assessment in open pit coal mining.

<text>María Cristina Narbona Ruiz (born 29 July 1951) is a Spanish politician who served as First Vice President of the Senate. She also presides over the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE).
From 18 April 2004 to April 2008, she served as Minister of Environment in the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. She is a trustee of the Fundacion IDEAS, a think tank linked to the PSOE.

==Biography==
Narbona was born in Madrid. At the age of 12 she emigrated to Rome with her parents, where she obtained a degree in economics before returning to Spain in 1975. Subsequently, she taught at the University of Seville and served in the regional government of Andalucia. In 1993 she joined the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). She served in the local government of Madrid in several capacities. She has represented Madrid in the Spanish Congress since 2000.

On 18 June 2017 she was elected president of Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Having been in a relationship with fellow PSOE politician Josep Borrell since 1998, they married in July 2018.

She tested positive for the COVID-19 on 1 February 2021 during the pandemic in Spain, but with mild symptoms.

==Political views==
In a 2002 interview with Telemadrid, Narbona argued that the price of housing in Spain was excessive and out of reach of young people, and called for more government aid in the housing sector.

Narbona is an opponent of nuclear power and supports the gradual closure of nuclear plants in Spain. She has also supported the implementation of the Kyoto Protocols in Spain.

<text>Isola 2000 is a ski resort in the southern French Alps. It is located on the territory of the commune of Isola, Alpes-Maritimes. It is one of the &quot;Stations du Mercantour&quot;, along with Auron and St. Dalmas, and is operated by the council of the &quot;Alpes-Maritimes&quot;. It is located next to the Mercantour National Park, and is about 90 km from Nice, France.

==History==
===Origins===
The area used to be part of the County of Nice in the Kingdom of Piedmont Sardinia. In 1861, with Italy&#x27;s unification, it became part of the Province of Cuneo. In 1947 following the treaty of Paris the area was given to France.

The idea of a ski resort near the small town of Isola first came from a British Army ex-officer, and Olympic skier, Peter Boumphrey, in the late 1960s, after he discovered a basin in the southern French Alps on a map. The local village of Isola owned the land he wanted to build the resort on – a small town located at an altitude of 900m, with poor prospects for development as citizens were migrating to the cities. As a result of this, the local mayor was happy to allow Boumphrey, and the London-based contractors he persuaded to help him, to build a ski resort above Isola, as the land required was of little value as farmland.

The regional government was concerned not too much about the resort itself, but about the road that was required to access it. Before the resort existed there was a small dirt road up the resort&#x27;s location, and avalanches were constantly blocking this in the winter, as well as rockslides in the summer. Therefore, the government was interested in building a slightly longer, but safer road to the resort, that could serve Isola 2000, and also another proposed resort, called Azur 2000, that was never built. However, the mayor of Isola was adamant that the road pass through his town, and the British contractors did not want the resort to be any further from Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport, a key aspect of the location, so the new route was scrapped, and the old road was upgraded.

In the summer of 1971 the resort officially finished, and had a capacity to sleep 6,000 people. It opened in December that year.

===Recent developments===
Over the resort&#x27;s history, many new lifts have been added and upgraded, such as new 6 seater and 4 seater chair lifts, as well as a new gondola, added in 2006. More accommodation has been built around the original 70s structure, and many bars, restaurants and shops have been established.

The access road to the Mediterranean coast has also been constantly improved by removing corners and adding bridges and tunnels. It is now very possible to make the drive in less than an hour and a half from the nearest city of Nice. There is also a regular bus service from many surrounding areas, with ticket prices very low, at around €1.00, making day trips amongst locals attractive and commonplace.

The 1993 Tour de France and 2024 Tour de France used Isola 2000 as a stage finish, and the 2008 Tour de France also passed through the resort.

On 23 March 2008, Isola hosted various slalom stages for the &quot;Championnats de France de Ski 2008&quot; (the 2008 French ski championships).

==Ski facilities==
===Lifts===
Isola 2000 currently has 2 gondola lifts, 9 chairlifts, 10 button lifts and 1 funicular, with a total capacity of about 20,000 pph.

===Piste===
The resort has over 120 km of piste, consisting of two main ski areas. There are 7 green runs, 21 blue runs, 11 red runs, and 4 black runs. The resort is considered by ski guides to be well suited for families, beginner and intermediate level skiers.

At 2000m, the resort is one of the highest in the Alps. This, with a favourable micro-climate, ensures fairly reliable snow cover, and in December 2007, Isola 2000 was the resort with the most snow cover in France. However, when required, there are over 210 snow cannons to guarantee skiable conditions.

The resort also has a snow park, including jumps and rails, 3 km of cross-country ski piste and downhill racing facilities.

==The resort==
===Architecture===
The buildings in the resort are mainly clustered around the original purpose-built structure from the early seventies. This complex incorporates much concrete in its design, and is considered by most visitors as an ugly building. However, there have been many smaller structures built around it, which are more akin to traditional wooden chalet style. As the resort is very high compared to other resorts, there are very few trees at the station altitude and above.

===Dining and nightlife===
The resort has a handful of bars and restaurants. It has been noted by some guides that the resort has limited night life.

<text>José Antonio Alonso Suárez (28 March 1960 – 2 February 2017) was a Spanish judge and politician, member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). He was member of the Spanish Cabinet from 2004 to 2008.

Born in León, he was a jurist (judge since 1985 after graduating from the University of Leon, magistrate 1989 and criminal court judge with the provincial court in Madrid) and academic at the law faculty of the University of Leon before his political career, Alonso was elected to the Spanish Congress as a member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in 2004, representing León Province and was re-elected in 2008. He later served as spokesman for the PSOE Parliamentary Group.

From 18 April 2004 to 7 April 2006 he was the Minister of the Interior in the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. Described by his ministerial colleagues as a man &quot;driven by his strong ideological beliefs and professionalism&quot;, Zapatero is said to have chosen Alonso on the grounds that the latter would fight terrorism without compromising human rights. Alonso served as the Minister of Defense until 11 April 2008. Prior to his election he had been a critic of the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s support for George W. Bush and their alleged politicisation of judicial bodies.

Alonso died from lung cancer in Madrid on 2 February 2017 at the age of 56.

<text>The Victorian Goldfields Railway is a broad gauge tourist railway in Victoria, Australia. It operates along a formerly disused branch line between the towns of Maldon and Castlemaine.

==History==
The original line was opened on 16 June 1884, opening up rail access from the established station at Castlemaine to the towns of Muckleford and Maldon. The area was prosperous, as Castlemaine and Maldon had both experienced gold rushes in the preceding years, and local residents had been petitioning the government for a railway since 1874. On 2 August 1884, a contract was let for an extension to Laanecoorie, however further construction was suspended after the line reached the small town of Shelbourne in 1891.

The line was served by twice-daily trains for the first forty years of its life, which was increased to four-times-daily trains in 1924. However, these were cut back at the end of the 1920s due to a decrease in the local population, and passenger services were eliminated altogether during World War II. This meant that the line was used by only a weekly goods train which went through to Shelbourne. When bushfire damage caused the closure of the Shelbourne extension in 1970, the remainder of the line was rendered largely useless, and it was officially closed on the 3rd of December, 1976.

The response to the closure from the local community was swift, and the Castlemaine and Maldon Railway Preservation Society was founded in the same month, with the intention of reopening the line as a tourist railway. While Maldon station was intact, and was able to be used as a base for their operations, they were faced with numerous problems: a line that needed substantial repairs, a lack of rolling stock, and rebuilding the demolished station at Muckleford.

==Reconstruction==

Over the next decade, volunteers obtained and renovated rolling stock and by 1986, trains were able to operate on a one kilometre section of track out of Maldon. By 1996, the line from Muckleford to Maldon had been restored, with the platforms being reinstated and a small replacement building being constructed. Services were able to operate along a regular timetable, and the society set about reopening the Muckleford-Castlemaine section of the line.

The project received the support of the local, state and federal governments. The necessary physical work had largely been completed by 2003, but it took another year to secure the necessary approvals and sign an agreement with freight operator Pacific National over the use of its line into Castlemaine station, which is still in regular passenger use today. The section of line finally opened on 19 December 2004, approximately a year behind schedule.
, the Society has shown no plans to restore the dismantled Shelbourne extension in the foreseeable future.

==Current operations==
The railway now operates two return trips to Castlemaine on Sundays, Wednesdays and public holidays. Steam locomotives operate most services, although the Society also operates diesels during days of total fire ban or when steam is not available. During December, January and February all services are hauled by diesel locomotives.

The Railway also operates a number of special trains such as Ales on Rails and Murder on the Orient Express Trains. Additionally, the railway offers Driver Experiences, where customers can drive a locomotive and Footplate Experiences where you can ride in the cab for either the Maldon to Muckleford or Muckleford to Maldon leg of the trip.

==Rolling stock==

===Locomotives owned by VGR===
===Leased locomotives===
Since 2011, Steamrail Victoria have leased members of their fleet to the VGR in order to lighten the load on the railway&#x27;s own limited fleet. This has seen use of K190, K153, D3 639 and Y164 on the Maldon branch.

===Carriages===

=== Guard&#x27;s vans ===

<doc id="1276539" wikidata="Q5436991" url="?curid=1276539" title="Fast Sunday">
<text>Fast Sunday (previously Fast Day) is a Sunday set aside by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for fasting by its members. On Fast Sunday, a fast and testimony meeting is held by local congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

== Overview ==
On Fast Sunday, church members are encouraged to fast for two consecutive meals. Members are also encouraged to give the money they save by not eating as a fast offering, which will be used by the church to financially assist those in need.

On Fast Sunday, the sacrament meeting is known as fast and testimony meeting. In this meeting, rather than predetermined speakers on particular subjects, the members are given the chance to voluntarily bear extemporaneous testimony to one another of gospel truths. Non-members of the church are welcome to participate in Fast Sunday activities.

Fast Sunday is usually the first Sunday of each month. In some circumstances, the week of Fast Sunday may be adjusted by church leaders. In many areas of the world, this occurs in April and October, when the church&#x27;s general conferences are held on the first Sunday of the month. They may also be adjusted due to stake conferences or temple dedications that are held on the first Sunday of the month.

In addition to the regular Fast Sunday, individuals, families, wards, or stakes may designate additional fast days for special needs of individuals, families, communities, or the church. No fast and testimony meeting is held for these non-regular fast days.

== History ==
Fast Day was started by Joseph Smith, as described by Brigham Young:

: You know that the first Thursday of each month we hold as a fast day. How many here know the origin of this day? Before tithing was paid, the poor were supported by donations. They came to Joseph and wanted help in Kirtland, and he said there should be a fast day, which was decided upon. It was to be held once a month, as it is now, and all that would have been eaten that day, of flour, or meat, or butter, or fruit, or anything else was to be carried to the fast meeting and put into the hands of a person selected for the purpose of taking care of it and distributing it among the poor.

During the 19th century, almost a fifth of converts in the United Kingdom were miners by profession. Their physical work made fasting during the week very difficult and an exception was granted to allow British miners to fast on Sundays instead of Thursdays. The practice became popular among the wider membership of the church in Britain and quickly spread. In 1896, Fast Day was changed to the first Sunday of the month, instead of the first Thursday. Since then, it has commonly been referred to as Fast Sunday.

Modern LDS Church leaders have affirmed the need for a Fast Day. Church apostle Gordon B. Hinckley stated:
== Studies ==
The LDS practice of intermittent fasting has been studied in the context of Mormons&#x27; lower rate of coronary artery disease and cardiac mortality. While this phenomenon has been attributed to LDS Church&#x27;s prohibition on tobacco and alcohol use, fasting practices have also been hypothesized to play a role.

<text>Juan Fernando López Aguilar (; born 10 June 1961) is a Spanish jurist and politician of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) who has been serving as a member of the European Parliament since 2009. He served as Minister of Justice in the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. He also represented Las Palmas in the Congress of Deputies between 1996 and 2007 and between 2008 and 2009.

==Early life and education==
López Aguilar was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. He holds a Ph.D. in law from the University of Bologna, Italy, and for a long time he has been a professor of constitutional law at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. He also holds a master&#x27;s degree in law and diplomacy from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. He funded his studies largely by working as a newspaper caricaturist and comic-book illustrator.

==Political career==

===Member of the Spanish Parliament, 1996–2007===
As a member of the Spanish parliament, López Aguilar served as his parliamentary group’s spokesperson on home affairs.

===Candidate for President of the Canary Islands, 2006–2007===
In November 2006, López Aguilar was chosen as the socialist candidate for the Presidency of the Canary Islands Government. 

He won the 2007 elections, but his majority was insufficient to defeat opposition manoeuvring that prevented him becoming leader of the regional government. Instead, he was later nominated to head the PSOE list in the 2009 European elections.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2009–present===
López Aguilar has been a Member of the European Parliament since the 2009 European elections. He has since been a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which he chaired during first term until 2014 and since 2019. In this capacity, he served as the parliament&#x27;s rapporteur on fundamental rights in Poland (2020) and on COVID-19 certificates (2021).

In addition, López Aguilar served on the Special Committee on Organized Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (2012-2013) and the Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion (2016-2017) that investigated the Panama Papers revelations and tax avoidance schemes more broadly.

Since 2014, López Aguilar also has been serving as vice-chairman of the parliament’s delegation to the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. He has taken part in monitoring missions for the Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2012, led by Paweł Kowal, and the Tajikistani parliamentary elections 2010.

In 2017, the company launched its biography, &quot;Kingdom of the Soap Queen: The Story of Balaji Telefilms&quot;.

==History==
The company was registered as &#x27;Balaji Telefilms Private Limited&#x27; on 11 November 1994 in Mumbai, India, with the objective of creating serials and other entertainment content by Ekta Kapoor and Shobha Kapoor. Balaji has specialized in formatted programming that can be adapted for languages around the nation as well as abroad. The most notable success includes &quot;Kasautii Zindagii Kay&quot; where she introduced the biggest fictional characters like Prerna and Komolika and &quot;Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi&quot;. Other examples include &quot;Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii&quot;, &quot;Kaahin Kissii Roz&quot;, &quot;Kahiin to Hoga&quot;, &quot;Kkusum&quot;, &quot;Kutumb&quot;, &quot;Kohi Apna Sa&quot;, &quot;Kasamh Se&quot;, &quot;Pavitra Rishta&quot;, &quot;Parichay&quot;, &quot;Kya Hua Tera Vaada&quot;, &quot;Jodha Akbar&quot;, &quot;Tere Liye&quot;, &quot;Bade Achhe Lagte Hain&quot;, &quot;Yeh Hai Mohabbatein&quot;, &quot;Naagin&quot;, &quot;Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki&quot;, &quot;Kumkum Bhagya&quot; and &quot;Kundali Bhagya&quot;. The later five are dubbed and re-produced in several languages across India and Asia. In recent years the company has been expanding its reality show output with shows such as titles such as &quot;Box Cricket League&quot; on Sony TV.

Balaji was incorporated as a public limited company on 29 February 2000, and its name was changed to &#x27;Balaji Telefilms Ltd&#x27; on 19 April 2000. The company made public issue of 28,00,000 equity shares of 10 each at a premium of 120 aggregating 36.40 crore. The issue included a book-built portion of 25,20,000 equity shares and a fixed price portion of 2,80,000 equity shares. In the same year, Nine Network Entertainment India Pvt. Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nine Broadcasting India Pvt. Ltd., merged with Balaji Telefilms Ltd. During 2000–04 the stock market capitalization grew sixteenfold to 571 crores when Star India acquired a 26% stake in the business.

Balaji Telefilms started a media training institute in 2010. Known as ICE Institute of Creative Excellence, it trains students in acting, cinematography, direction, modelling, etc.
In 2014, the company and Ekta Kapoor were subject to protests in Jaipur led by the Shri Rajput Karni Sena (SRKS), a Hindutva group. These occurred because of perceived communal slights in the &quot;Jodha Akbar&quot; television series.

In 2015, Balaji Telefilms produced a finite series, &quot;Naagin&quot;, which became the most viewed show on Indian television since its inception. The show won multiple awards and returned for its second and third season, which also generated high ratings. The fourth season of series was broadcast starting in December 2019 but it was not doing well on television so it was replaced by the fifth season of the series in August 2020.

In 2017, Reliance Industries acquired a 25% stake in Balaji Telefilms for Rs413 crore. The deal gave RIL access to Balaji Telefilms&#x27; content for use by telecom unit Reliance Jio.

<doc id="1276547" wikidata="Q5437043" url="?curid=1276547" title="Fast offering">
<text>Fast offering is the term used in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to denote money or usable commodities donated to the church, which are then used to provide financial or other assistance to those in need. The local bishop or branch president is responsible for the use of the fast offering resources, and is usually assisted by other local church leaders to identify individuals and families to receive assistance and to disburse the resources.

==Background==
Members are encouraged to fast once a month on Fast Sunday and to give the money they save by not eating two meals to the church; those who can afford to be more generous are encouraged to give more than simply the money saved as a fast offering. Members may also choose to fast and donate fast offerings more than once per month.

When the Mormon pioneers first settled in the western United States in 1847, LDS Church leaders encouraged members to perform their fast on the first Thursday of each month, and to donate the food thus saved to their bishop. This food was collected in small buildings called &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Storehouses&quot;, and were held until needed by other members. Over time, this practice was changed: the members, who were primarily farmers and laborers, had difficulty fasting on a day of regular labor, so the day of observance was changed to Sunday. When money, in the form of specie instead of barter, became more available in Utah Territory, members were encouraged to make their donations in cash, which could better be held until needed to purchase food.

==Purposes==
Donations from fast offerings are not used for the same purposes as those monies given through tithes. Specifically, fast offerings are used to provide food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and other necessities for those who are in need, fulfilling the meaning conveyed in , with attendant blessings to the giver and the receiver. Tithing funds are used to build and maintain meetinghouses, temples, and educational facilities; for the general maintenance of church operations; and for costs of missionary and genealogical and family history work.

==Collection methods==
Church members are encouraged to make regular financial contributions to the church through the leader of the local church unit, usually a bishop. The combined contribution can include tithing, fast offerings, and other humanitarian donations, and is delivered to the leader on a &quot;convenience&quot; basis (i.e., there is no set time either in or outside of a formal meeting where the funds are requested). 

Young men (deacons or teachers in the Aaronic Priesthood) are often assigned to pass by members&#x27; residences to inquire if they can convey any fast offerings to the bishop. In some areas, members may also pay fast offerings on the Internet.

There is no requirement to make any financial donation to fast offerings or any of the church&#x27;s other funds in order to maintain one&#x27;s membership; such donations are encouraged but are not mandatory.

==Distribution==
No publicly available accounting of fast offerings exists. (The LDS Church does disclose its financials in the United Kingdom, Canada, and other jurisdictions where it is required to do so by law. These financials are audited by the UK office of PricewaterhouseCoopers.) However, it is claimed by the church that fast offering funds are primarily available to the bishop to distribute to those in need in the area where they were collected, but that any excess (or deficiency) is shared with the rest of the church, first on a stake level, then on wider levels.

Bishops are instructed by church guidelines that they have &quot;a divine mandate to seek out and care for the poor (see D&amp;C 84:112). It is not enough to assist [with fast offerings] only when asked.&quot;

==Purpose of fast offerings, and financial prudence==
While administering to the needs of the poor through use of the fast offering funds, each bishop is also counseled to encourage individuals and families to become self-reliant through reducing debt, seeking work opportunities or improved income through education if needed, and paying tithes and offerings to receive temporal blessings from the Lord as promised in .

<text>Yeungjin University, formerly Yeungjin College, is a private technical college located in Buk-gu, Daegu, South Korea. Information technology is the principal academic focus; however, courses of study in other fields such as nursing and international tourism are also provided.

Yeungjin University also operates Yeungjin Cyber College, which since 2002 has offered its own two-year courses of study in fields such as computer science and multimedia, e-management, social welfare, and real estate. The cyber college employs seven full-time instructors and 41 adjunct faculty, teaching a virtual student body of about 800.

== History ==

The school first opened its doors as Yeungjin Technical School on March 12, 1977. It became a college in 1985.

Yeungjin University newest project is the Daegu English Village, located outside of Waegwan.

==Sister colleges==

Yeungjin maintains sisterhood relationships with a total of 34 institutions around the world. A significant number of these are in the Philippines, as during the 1990s Yeungjin College was actively involved in developing IT programs at many Philippine universities. Others are located in the United States, Taiwan, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The first sisterhood ties established were with Ertong Technical College of Taiwan in 1981.

<text>Bathycles of Magnesia () was an Ionian sculptor of Magnesia on the Maeander. He was commissioned by the Spartans to make a marble throne for the statue of Apollo at Amyclae, about 550 BC. Pausanias (iii.18) gives us a detailed description of this monument, which is of the greatest value to us, showing the character of Ionic art at the time. It was adorned with scenes from mythology in relief and supporting figures in the round. Adolf Furtwängler, on p. 706 of &quot;Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik&quot; (1893), gives a reconstruction of the work.

<doc id="1276579" wikidata="Q1132584" url="?curid=1276579" title="Renault Modus">
<text>The Renault Modus is a mini MPV produced by the French manufacturer Renault from August 2004 to December 2012, in Valladolid, Spain. The production version is very similar to the concept car of the same name, which was presented at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show. It is essentially a taller version of the Clio III and, as such, shared its platform and much of its engine range with the third generation of the Clio.

A larger wheelbase version was produced as the Renault Grand Modus. Originally marketed as &quot;a higher-range alternative to the Twingo and Clio&quot;, it aimed to provide the practicality and versatility of the larger Renault Scénic in a smaller footprint. The Clio platform that spawned the Modus also gave rise to the current Nissan Micra and its monospace relative, the Nissan Note.

==Design features==


Marketed as the &quot;Triptic System,&quot; the Modus&#x27; rear seats are mounted on sliding rails with four preset positions. When in the rearmost two positions the seats are configured for two people with increased leg, hip, and shoulder room. When in the forward positions they are configured for three passengers, increasing cargo capacity.

Another seat-based feature of Modus is the &quot;Stay Put&quot; system. The base of the front passenger seat flips up to reveal a storage compartment. An optional feature of the Modus is a boot chute, a drop-down opening in the centre of the tailgate below the rear window.

The facelifted Modus was launched in Europe in 2007, featuring colour coded bumpers on all versions, clear Perspex &#x27;glass&#x27; indicator bezels, revised side door mouldings and updated interior trim on all specification levels.

===Restyle===

Soon after, in February 2008, a restyled Modus and the new Grand Modus were launched. Also that year, the Grand Modus replaced the Modus in Spain. The Grand Modus has an extended length of and a boot volume of 410 litres () below the parcel shelf.

This restyle saw changes made to the front and rear of the standard model to match the styling of the newer Grand variant. The boot chute has been removed from the options list.

In February 2012, Renault discontinued the Modus, Espace, Kangoo, Laguna, and Wind lines in the United Kingdom.

==Safety==
The Modus was the first small car to receive the full 5 Euro NCAP stars for passenger safety due in part to its six airbag system, front and rear side impact bars and ISOFIX child seat fixing points. It was also one of the first cars in its class to have such features as automatic headlamps and windscreen wipers on its options list.

The Modus was offered with a cornering lamp function. Concealed in the main headlamp unit and operating at speeds less than , the lights gave the driver a wider field of vision when going round bends. On Privilège and Initiale models, Renault offered the Modus with &quot;double distance&quot; Xenon headlamps.

==Mechanicals==

=== Phase I ===

=== Phase II ===

*QS5 = QuickShift5

In terms of reliability, according to the 2006 breakdown survey from the German Automobile Club, the Modus ranks 3rd in its class with an average 5.8 breakdowns per 1,000 vehicles after three years. This is behind the Audi A2 (1st) and the BMW Mini (2nd) and ahead of the Lupo (4th) &amp; Polo (5th), Toyota Yaris (6th) and Honda Jazz (7th).

<doc id="1276590" wikidata="Q17015107" url="?curid=1276590" title="National Maritime Board">
<text>:&quot;This is about the Maritime Board in the United Kingdom. For the Board in the Philippines, see National Seamen Board.&quot;
The National Maritime Board (NMB) was a bilateral board governing wages and working practices in the British shipping industry.

It was founded in November 1917 against a backdrop of strike action amongst seafarers and was originally intended as a purely wartime measure to facilitate wage negotiations in a period of rapid inflation. It built upon the union-employer relationship that had emerged during the war years and brought together representatives of the Shipping Federation, the National Union of Seamen and the National Union of Ship&#x27;s Stewards, as well as some smaller unions in the industry, but allowing the British Seafarers&#x27; Union only local representation. In 1919 the board was re-established as a permanent body and set about establishing national wage rates for all grades, the first time such rates had been enforced. Aylmer Vallance was appointed as the board&#x27;s General Secretary.

In the 1920s, the board imposed a series of wage reductions with the support of the National Union of Seamen. The Ship&#x27;s Stewards Union opposed the first of these reductions in 1921, and its members were locked out. At this time, the board also became embroiled in controversies over the policy of Joint Control introduced by the NUS and Shipping Federation. This arrangement aimed to ensure that seafarers could only gain employment if in possession of a form endorsed by both the union and the employers&#x27; organisation. It was allegedly widely used to force out of employment members of rival unions, communists, and other &#x27;agitators&#x27;.

Later history is unclear: the University of Warwick&#x27;s Modern Records Centre states that &quot;the records of the Board currently held [...] end in 1985 [...] and it is not known how the organisation continued to operate after this time&quot;.

<text>Andrzej Kowerski (; 18 May 1912 – 8 December 1988) was a Polish Army officer and SOE agent during World War II. From 1941 he used the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Andrew Kennedy.

==Life==
Before the war Kowerski lost a part of one leg in a hunting accident.

During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, Lieutenant Kowerski fought as a member of Poland&#x27;s 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, commanded by Col. Stanisław Maczek, winning his country&#x27;s highest military decoration, the &quot;Virtuti Militari&quot;.

When Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland on September 17, forcing Poland&#x27;s government to evacuate south into Romania, Kowerski and his &quot;Black Brigade&quot; (so called after their black leather jackets) evacuated to neighboring Hungary. There he was involved in covert activities, exfiltrating interned Polish, and other Allied, military personnel out of Hungary.

When Kowerski subsequently worked for British Intelligence and the Special Operations Executive, he was given the cover name &quot;Andrew Kennedy.&quot; Having lost part of a leg, he became the first disabled man to complete SOE&#x27;s parachute training. (His lover, Krystyna Skarbek, aka Christine Granville, was the longest serving female agent of SOE and one of its most prominent. They had first met as children at her family&#x27;s stables when his father had brought him over to play with ten-year-old Krystyna while he and her father discussed agricultural matters.)

===Disappearance of Reichsbank and Abwehr reserves===
Between 1952 and 1954, Kowerski joined up with his friend W. Stanley Moss to investigate a mystery of the final days of the Third Reich. In April and May 1945, the remaining reserves of the Reichsbank – gold (730 bars), cash (6 large sacks), and precious stones and metals such as platinum (25 sealed boxes) – were dispatched by Walther Funk to be buried on the Klausenhof Mountain at Einsiedl in Bavaria, where the final German resistance was to be concentrated. Similarly the Abwehr cash reserves were hidden nearby in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Shortly after the American forces overran the area, the reserves and money disappeared. Moss and Kennedy travelled back and forth across Germany and into Switzerland and corresponded with fugitives in Argentina, to research what had happened. The disappearance of Major Martin Borg, the US Military Governor of Garmisch-Partenkirchen at the time, has not been explained.

Later, Moss and Kennedy went on to uncover the consequences of Heinrich Himmler’s order of 28 October 1939, which confirmed the Lebensborn programme. They researched what had become of the children born as a result of the order.

==Death and burial==
Kowerski died from cancer in Munich, Germany, in December 1988. His ashes were flown to London and interred at the foot of Skarbek&#x27;s grave in St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, northwest London.

<text>The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (; commonly abbreviated as BSP in both Filipino and English) is the central bank of the Philippines. It was established on January 3, 1949, and then re-established on July 3, 1993 pursuant to the provision of Republic Act 7653 or the New Central Bank Act of 1993 as amended by Republic Act 11211 or the New Central Bank Act of 2019. The principal author was Senator Franklin Drilon. It was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte.

==History==
=== American era and World War II ===

In 1900, the First Philippine Commission passed Act No. 52, which placed all banks under the Bureau of the Treasury and authorizing the Insular Treasurer to supervise and examine banks and all banking activity. In 1929, the Department of Finance, through the Bureau of Banking, took over bank supervision.
By 1933, a group of Filipinos had conceptualized a central bank for the Philippine Islands. It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act, which would grant Philippine independence after 12 years, but reserving military and naval bases for the United States and imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. However, the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act would be rejected by the Senate of the Philippines at the urging of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. This Senate then advocated a new bill that won United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s support, this would be the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which would grant Philippine independence on July 4, 1946.

Under the Commonwealth, discussions continued regarding the idea of a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth. The country&#x27;s monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury, and the Philippine piso was on the exchange standard using the United States dollar, which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve, as the standard currency.

As required by the Tydings–McDuffie Act, the National Assembly of the Philippines in 1939 passed a law establishing a central bank. As it was a monetary law, it required the approval of the President of the United States; Franklin D. Roosevelt did not give his. A second law was passed in 1944 under the Japanese-controlled Second Republic during the Second World War, but the 1945 arrival of American liberation forces, aided by Philippine Commonwealth troops and recognised guerrillas, aborted its implementation.

=== Third Republic and martial law ===
Shortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946, he instructed then-Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno, Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank. The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine-American Finance Commission chaired by Cuaderno. The commission, which studied Philippine financial, monetary, and fiscal problems in 1947, recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system. A central bank was needed to implement this proposed shift.

Roxas then created the Central Bank Council to prepare the charter of a proposed monetary authority. It was submitted to Congress in February 1948. The Central Bank Act authored by then Congressman José J. Roy was signed into law in June of the same year by the newly proclaimed President Elpidio Quirino, who succeeded the late President Roxas, affixing his signature on Republic Act (RA) No. 265 or the Central Bank Act of 1948. On January 3, 1949, the Central Bank of the Philippines was formally inaugurated with Cuaderno as the first governor. The main duties and responsibilities of the Central Bank were to promote economic development and maintain internal and external monetary stability.

Over the years, changes were introduced to make the charter more responsive to the needs of the economy. On November 29, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; Presidential Decree No. 72 amended Republic Act No. 265, emphasizing the maintenance of domestic and international monetary stability as the primary objective of the Central Bank. The Bank&#x27;s authority was also expanded to include regulation of the nation&#x27;s entire financial system just supervision of the banking system. In 1981, RA 265, as amended, was further improved to strengthen the financial system, among the changes was the increase in the capitalization of the Central Bank from ₱10 million to ₱10 billion.

In the 1973 Constitution, the interim &quot;Batasang Pambansa&quot; (National Assembly) was mandated to establish an independent central monetary authority. Presidential Decree No. 1801 designated the Central Bank of the Philippines as the central monetary authority (CMA). According to a confidential October 19, 1984 Monetary Board report, the Central bank overstated the country&#x27;s dollar reserves at $600 million.

Following the overthrow of President Marcos, the 1987 Constitution adopted the CMA provisions from the 1973 Constitution that were aimed at establishing an independent monetary authority through increased capitalization and greater private sector representation in the Monetary Board.

=== Present ===
In accordance with a provision in the 1987 Constitution, President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 7653, otherwise known as &quot;The New Central Bank Act&quot;, into law on June 14, 1993. Taking on the reins of the then bankrupted entity, this new law provides for the establishment of an independent monetary authority to be known as the &quot;Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas&quot;, its primary objective being the maintenance of price stability. This objective was only implied in the old Central Bank charter. The law also gives the &quot;Bangko Sentral&quot; fiscal and administrative autonomy which the old Central Bank did not have. On July 3, 1993, the New Central Bank Act took effect.
On the evening of September 26, 2012, a Wednesday, the BSP website was hacked by a group named &quot;Anonymous Philippine&quot;s in a protest against the recently passed Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. The website was promptly restored in the early hours of the following day.

On April 23, 2013, The Asian Banker named the BSP as the Best Macroeconomic Regulator in the Asia-Pacific Region for 2013 in &quot;The Asian Banker Leadership Achievement Awards&quot; in Jakarta, Indonesia. The BSP was cited as a &quot;good, strong, and fair-minded regulator.&quot; About a month later, the BSP was given the country award by the Child and Youth Finance International in its 2013 International Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, in recognition of its initiative to integrate financial literacy education into the Philippine elementary school curriculum. In 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed R.A. 11211, further increasing the Bank&#x27;s capitalization to ₱200 billion.

==== Project Nexus ====
The Bank for International Settlements signed an agreement with Central Bank of Malaysia, Bank of Thailand, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Reserve Bank of India on 30 June 2024 as founding member of Project Nexus, a multilateral international initiative to enable retail cross-border payments.

==Microfinance and financial inclusion==
In 2000, the General Banking Law mandated the BSP to recognize microfinance as a legitimate banking activity and to set the rules and regulations for its practice within the banking sector. In the same year, the BSP declared microfinance as its flagship program for poverty alleviation. The BSP has become the prime advocate for the development of microfinance. To this end, the Bangko Sentral aims to:

# Provide the enabling policy and regulatory environment;
# Increase the capacity of the BSP and banking sector on microfinance operations; and
# Promote and advocate for the development of sound and sustainable microfinance operations.

The Bank is active in promoting a financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico.

==Anti-money laundering==
With money laundering being one of the problems of the Philippines, the BSP has issued a number of measures to bring the Philippines&#x27; regulatory regime on money laundering closer to international standards. In September 2001, the &quot;Anti-Money Laundering Act&quot;, or AMLA, was made into law. The AMLA defined money laundering a criminal offense, and prescribed corresponding penalties. It also provided the foundation for a central monitoring and implementing council called the &quot;Anti-Money Laundering Council&quot; (AMLC). The AMLC is composed of the Governor of the Bangko Sentral as chair, and the Commissioner of the Insurance Commission and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as members, all acting unanimously in the discharge of the group&#x27;s mandate.

In February 2013, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III signed &quot;Republic Act No. 10365&quot; known as &quot;An Act Further Strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Law&quot;, which aims to strengthen the AMLC by requiring that any suspicious transaction in foreign exchange, real estate, and jewelry and precious metal trading be reported.

==Governors==
==Logo==

The 2020 logo of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas was first adopted as the central bank&#x27;s primary logo in November 20, 2020 with the design receiving endorsement by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP). The circular symbol features a full-bodied gold-colored Philippine eagle based on actual photographs of the bird and three stars.

The logo featuring a blue and white logo and a more stylized rendition of the eagle, used since June 18, 2010 (concurrently with the 1993 from June 18, 2010 until the demonetization of commemorative banknotes under the New Design Series on August 2, 2019 and 2020 logos since November 20, 2020), is still currently used in banknotes and coinage in circulation since December 16, 2010 and November 30, 2017, respectively. It was used on New Generation Currency banknotes printed from December 16, 2010 to December 2022 and coins minted from November 30, 2017 until the said month of 2022, and on its headquarters in Manila and Security Plant Complex in Quezon City from 2012 to 2022.

== Museum ==
Within the main Manila complex of the BSP is the &quot;Museo ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas&quot; (English: Museum of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas). Inaugurated on January 3, 1999, as part of the golden jubilee of central banking in the country, the &quot;Museo&quot; showcases the BSP&#x27;s collection of currencies.

As repository and custodian of the country&#x27;s numismatic heritage, the &quot;Museo&quot; collects, studies and preserves coins, paper notes, medals, artifacts and monetary items found in the Philippines during its different historical periods. These collections have been placed on permanent display at the &quot;Museo&quot;. Designed to &quot;walk&quot; the visitor through a number of galleries dedicated to a specific historical period of the country, the &quot;Museo&quot; visually narrates the development of the Philippine economy, parallel to the evolution of its currency. Complementary paintings from the BSP&#x27;s art collection, together with chosen artifacts, enhance each gallery.

A panoramic memorabilia of central banking in the Philippines, it showcases the strides made in bringing about price stability to sustain economic growth in the country. The exhibition hall also features portrait busts of previous governors.

==Security Plant Complex==

The Security Plant Complex, or SPC, was formally established on September 7, 1978, to safeguard the printing, minting, refining, issuance, distribution and durability of coins, banknotes, gold bars, government official receipts, lottery tickets, internal revenue stamps, passports, seaman identification record books, strip stamps, official documents, registration certificates, Torrens titles, treasury warrants, stocks and bonds, government contracts, ration coupons, official ballots, election return forms, checks and other security printing or minting jobs of the Philippine government.

Printing of official ballots and other public documents was later transferred to the National Printing Office pursuant to Executive Order No. 285 issued on July 25, 1987.

On August 4, 2003, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo issued &quot;Administrative Order No. 79&quot;, which designated the SPC as the sole producer of insignia of national orders, decorations, and medals.

The BSP will relocate its security plant complex from East Avenue, Quezon City to the National Government Administrative Center district of New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac after it signed a memorandum of agreement with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority in September 2019. The new currency production facility will be located on a plot near the access road connecting New Clark City in Pampanga to the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway and it is expected to be completed within two years.

<doc id="1276611" wikidata="Q5526485" url="?curid=1276611" title="Gaslight Radio">
<text>Gaslight Radio were an Australian indie rock band. It was founded by brothers, Martin (guitar) and Rory Cooke (vocals, guitar) with Simon Piper (drums) and Phil Roubin (bass guitar) in Burleigh Heads, Queensland in 1995. They released three studio albums, &quot;Hitch on the Leaves&quot; (September 1998), &quot;Z-Nation&quot; (2003) and &quot;Good Heavens Mean Times&quot; (July 2006), before disbanding in 2009.

== History ==
Gaslight Radio formed at Burleigh Heads, Queensland in 1995 as an indie guitar pop group by Rory Cooke on vocals and guitar, his brother Martin Cooke on guitar, Phil Roubin on bass guitar and Simon Piper on drums. The Cooke brothers grew up in a housing commission suburb, Burleigh Park, which later became part of Burleigh Heads. Rory later explained why he took up song writing, &quot;If someone is in their bedroom with their headphones on, trying to drown their parents&#x27; fighting, that&#x27;s when music can mean the most.&quot;

Gaslight Radio recorded a four-track demo in the Gold Coast hinterland, which included the track &quot;Tarmac and Line&quot;. The demo was sent to Mushroom Records, where the band signed with an independent offshoot – Lonely Guy Records. The first EP, &quot;Torchin&#x27; Towns, Hankering Homes&quot; (August 1996), was recorded over the Easter weekend with Greg Wales (Drop City) producing at Smash Studios, Sydney. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, opined, &quot;With influences drawn from US bands like The Pixies, Pavement and The Breeders, the band fashioned a compelling brand of low-fi indie guitar pop.&quot; Its five tracks were &quot;earning the band across-the-board praise.&quot; &quot;Tarmac and Line&quot; was one of its popular tracks.

The group played several shows in the Gold Coast and Brisbane prior to the release of the EP, including co-headlining with another Gold Coast band, Pollen. They toured Australia for a year &quot;with other like-minded bands such as Autohaze, Drop City and Pollen.&quot; After its release their material gained high rotation on JJJ radio and independent stations ZZZ and RRR. They appeared at the Big Day Out, Gold Coast and at Brisbane&#x27;s Livid festival.

They recorded their second five-track EP, &quot;...Our Dolelove&quot; (June 1997), in Melbourne during mid-1997 with the assistance of Charles Bickford from the Paradise Motel. It appeared via Lonely Guy Records and was distributed by Mushroom Distribution Services (MDS). McFarlane felt its &quot;track &#x27;The Singer&#x27;s a Liar&#x27; highlighted the band&#x27;s off-kilter inventiveness.&quot; Extensive touring was undertaken in support of the EP, including a national support with Even and Header.

In late 1997 Gaslight Radio recorded four tracks for their third EP, &quot;Is by Bus&quot; (November 1997), with Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Magic Dirt) at Birdland Studios, Melbourne. The title track, &quot;Is by Bus&quot;, received significant airplay. Phil Roubin departed the band, prior to their relocation from the Gold Coast to Melbourne.

Gaslight Radio&#x27;s debut, &quot;Hitch on the Leaves&quot; (September 1998), was released to critical acclaim: McFarlane described it as &quot;a fine example of indie guitar-pop,&quot; while AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett rated it as four out-of five stars. He explained, &quot;[it is] a wonderful debut album from this quintet, equal parts pretty Cocteau Twins-inspired shoegaze and fragile rock drive... [they] don&#x27;t sound like a cloning of any one group in particular, partially since the group turns from total feedback overdrive to subtler, slow motion approaches.&quot;

In December 1999 they issued a six-track EP, &quot;Sleeveful of Slight&quot;, via Silvertone Records, &quot;With a new bass player and drummer installed, the band recorded new material.&quot; Five of its tracks were recorded in October with Tim Whitten producing. Cameron Webb of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; felt the title track is &quot;easily the best track here and is forged from the same mould used for the previously released &#x27;Is by Bus&#x27; and &#x27;Spindlings of the Summer&#x27;.&quot;

Webb observed, &quot;Upbeat catchy pop with skewed guitars and abstract lyrics have become the trademark of Gaslight Radio and there is no shortage of those elements here. However, it is nice to hear a more minimalist approach taken to most of the other tracks where drums have been stripped back and a greater prevalence bestowed upon the organ.&quot;

A six-track EP, &quot;Chapter 6: The Hard Luck Knights&quot;, was released in 2002 via Love + Mercy / Inertia Records. &quot;Oz Music Project&quot;″s Jasper Lee opined &quot;[it] follows nicely onto their last release, the 7&quot; &quot;Sleeveful of Slight&quot; and is broken down into two single tracks and four demo recordings... Not much to fault here, it&#x27;s very much a Gaslight Radio disc, with their sound relatively intact through the years in the musical wilderness.&quot;

&quot;Z-Nation&quot;, the group&#x27;s second album, was issued in 2003 via Love + Mercy / Inertia with Gravina, Michael Alonso and Glen Berry producing. According to Sam Fell of &quot;Mess + Noise&quot; &quot;[it] was a polarising release. Still, it was a record that found the band comfortable in their own musical skin; one where they developed their signature wall of sound. &#x27;I like that album. Not many people do, but I do,&#x27; [Rory] Cooke jokes. &#x27;Marty and I had been doing it for a long time by that stage, we knew how to do it, realised strengths and weaknesses of certain things&#x27;.&quot; Lee opined &quot;the band have added several members to their ranks, the sum total of their parts being a fuller version of their earlier incarnation. The ever-languid vocals of Rory Cooke still glide through the band&#x27;s defining jangly indie rhythms with a seemingly enhanced vigour.&quot;

Gaslight Radio released a compilation album, &quot;Magic Castle Broke Songs&quot;, in August 2004. It included tracks from their first four EPs. The group&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Good Heavens Mean Times&quot; appeared in July 2006. Darren Levin of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; observed &quot;the members had to weather homelessness, doomed relationships and Melbourne&#x27;s hottest summer in 45 years. Tracked in five days at Birdland Studios, most of the album was written on the lounge-room floor of bass player Michael Regan&#x27;s flat, where songwriting brothers Martin and Rory Cooke were temporarily housed.&quot;

In August 2007, New Zealand group Cut Off Your Hands, performed &quot;Is by Bus&quot;, on Triple J&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; program. In 2009 Gaslight Radio disbanded with Rory and Martin Cooke pursuing their own projects: Forty Thousand Sisters for Martin, and the Eliza Band for Rory. Latter day members of Gaslight Radio included Nick Treweek (2nd drummer), Matt Davis (keys), Emily Fullerton (keys), Alex Jarvis (guitar), Peter Mclean (guitar), Michael Regan (bass) and Cameron Teys (drums). In June 2015 Emporio Armani choose &quot;Change the Ending&quot; from Gaslight Radio&#x27;s album, &quot;Good Heavens Mean Times&quot;, for an ad campaign. Martin explained &quot;[it] was sourced old school, someone heard it on Youtube, and the negotiations started.&quot; The track was co-written by the Cooke brothers.

<text>The British Rail Class D2/11 was a British class of locomotive designed in 1958 by Brush Traction and Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, which co-operated to produce five prototype diesel-electric shunting locomotives of 0-4-0 wheel arrangement. They were intended to demonstrate a new generation of diesel shunters for industrial and mainline use. Two were loaned to British Railways for trials and one, number D2999, was subsequently purchased by BR. However, no large scale orders resulted from these demonstrators.

Similar locomotives were built for industrial use, notably for steelworks in South Wales and Yorkshire. These were built by Brush Traction working with Bagnall.

==D2999==
D2999 was loaned by Brush Traction to British Railways (BR) from January 1960 and was allocated to Stratford TMD where it was subsequently allocated to the goods yard at Globe Road &amp; Devonshire Street. The locomotive proved popular at Devonshire Street and in September 1960 and subsequently purchased by them for further use. It was classified as British Rail Class D2/11 at this point, and remained there bar the odd maintenance visit to Stratford, until 15 October 1967 when it was withdrawn. It was fitted with a National M4AAV6 engine of , had a maximum speed of and weighed . D2999 is preserved on the Middleton Railway.

==D9998==
D9998 was on loan to BR for approximately a year from mid-1961. It was fitted with a Petter-McLaren engine of , had a maximum speed of and weighed .

<doc id="1276616" wikidata="Q424151" url="?curid=1276616" title="Sibutramine">
<text>Sibutramine, formerly sold under the brand name Meridia among others, is an appetite suppressant which has been discontinued in many countries. It works as a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) similar to certain antidepressants. Until 2010, it was widely marketed and prescribed as an adjunct in the treatment of obesity along with diet and exercise. It has been associated with increased cardiovascular diseases and strokes and has been withdrawn from the market in 2010 in several countries and regions including 
Australia, Canada,
China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was never approved in Japan. However, the drug remains available in some countries.

Sibutramine was originally developed in 1988 by Boots in Nottingham, UK, and manufactured and marketed by Abbott Laboratories and sold under a variety of brand names including Reductil, Meridia, Siredia, and Sibutrex before its withdrawal 2010 from most markets. It was classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States.

As of 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still found sibutramine in over 700 diet supplements marketed as &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;traditional&quot;, or &quot;herbal remedies&quot;.

==Medical uses==
Sibutramine has been used to produce appetite suppression for the purpose of attaining weight loss in the treatment of patients with obesity.

==Contraindications==
Sibutramine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Psychiatric conditions as bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, severe depression, or pre-existing mania
* Patients with a history of or a predisposition to drug or alcohol abuse
* Hypersensitivity to the drug or any of the inactive ingredients
* Patients below 18 and above 65 years of age
* Concomitant treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), antidepressant, or other centrally active drugs, particularly other anoretics
* History of peripheral artery disease
* Hypertension that is not sufficiently controlled (e.g., &gt;145/90 mmHg), caution in controlled hypertension
* Existing pulmonary hypertension
* Existing damage on heart valves, congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), tachycardia, arrhythmia, or cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA])
* Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)
* Closed-angle glaucoma
* Epilepsy
* Enlargement of the prostate gland with urinary retention (relative contraindication)
* Pheochromocytoma
* Pregnant and lactating women (relative contraindication)

==Side effects==
A higher number of cardiovascular events has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%). In 2010, the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.

Frequently encountered side effects include dry mouth, paradoxically increased appetite, nausea, strange taste in the mouth, abdominal pain, constipation, insomnia, dizziness, drowsiness, menstrual cramps, headache, flushing, or joint/muscle pain.

In a 2016 Cochrane review, sibutramine was found to substantially increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients, in the updated review in 2021 sibutramine was not included since the drug had been withdrawn from the market. When used, regular blood pressure monitoring needed to be performed.

The following side effects are infrequent but serious and require immediate medical attention: cardiac arrhythmias, paresthesia, mental changes (e.g., excitement, restlessness, confusion, depression, rare thoughts of suicide).

Symptoms that require urgent medical attention are seizures, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, melena, hematemesis, jaundice, fever and rigors, chest pain, hemiplegia, abnormal vision, dyspnea and edema.

Currently, no case of pulmonary hypertension has been noted. (Fenfluramine, of the 1990s &quot;Fen-Phen&quot; combo, forced excess release of neurotransmitters—a different action. Phentermine was uninvolved in the rare—but clinically significant—heart issues of fenfluramine.)

== Interactions ==

Sibutramine has a number of clinically significant interactions. The concomitant use of sibutramine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, such as selegiline) is not indicated, as it may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a somewhat rare but serious adverse drug reaction. Sibutramine should not be taken within two weeks of stopping or starting an MAOI. Taking both sibutramine and certain medications used in the treatment of migraines—such as ergolines and triptans—as well as opioids, may also increase the risk for serotonin syndrome, as may the use of more than one serotonin reuptake inhibitor at the same time.

The concomitant use of sibutramine and drugs which inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, may increase plasma levels of sibutramine.
Sibutramine does not affect the efficacy of hormonal contraception.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Sibutramine is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that, in humans, reduces the reuptake of norepinephrine (by ~73%), serotonin (by ~54%), and dopamine (by ~16%), thereby increasing the levels of these substances in synaptic clefts and helping enhance ; the serotonergic action, in particular, is thought to influence appetite. Older anorectic agents such as amphetamine and fenfluramine force the release of these neurotransmitters rather than affecting their reuptake.

Sibutramine&#x27;s mechanism of action is similar to tricyclic antidepressants, and it has demonstrated antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 1997 for the treatment of obesity.

Sibutramine is reported to be a prodrug to two active metabolites, desmethylsibutramine (M1; BTS-54354) and didesmethylsibutramine (M2; BTS-54505), with much greater potency as monoamine reuptake inhibitors. Further studies have indicated that the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomers of each metabolite exert significantly stronger anorectic effects than the (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomers.

Unlike other serotonergic appetite suppressants like fenfluramine, sibutramine and its metabolites have only low and likely inconsequential affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Sibutramine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its peak plasma level after 1 hour and has also a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine.

==Chemistry==
Sibutramine has usually been used in the form of the hydrochloride monohydrate salt.

===Detection in body fluids===

Sibutramine and its two active &quot;N&quot;-demethylated metabolites may be measured in biofluids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of these three species are usually in the 1–10 &quot;μ&quot;g/L range in persons undergoing therapy with the drug. The parent compound and norsibutramine are often not detectable in urine, but dinorsibutramine is generally present at concentrations of &gt;200 &quot;μ&quot;g/L.

==Society and culture==
===Regulatory approval, 1997–2010===
Sibutramine was originally developed in 1988 by Boots in Nottingham, UK,/ and marketed by Knoll Pharmaceuticals after BASF/Knoll AG purchased the Boots Research Division in 1995. 
It was classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States.

In 1997, the US FDA approved it for weight loss and maintenance of weight loss in people with a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 or for people with a BMI ≥27 kg/m2 who have other cardiovascular risk factors. It was manufactured and marketed by Abbott Laboratoriess.
It was sold under a variety of brand names including Reductil, Meridia, Siredia, and Sibutrex.

In 2002, studies looked into reports of sudden death, heart failure, renal failure and gastrointestinal problems. Despite a 2002 petition by Ralph Nader-founded NGO Public Citizen, the FDA made no attempts to withdraw the drug, but was part of a Senate hearing in 2005. Similarly, in 2004, David Graham, FDA &quot;whistleblower&quot;, testified before a Senate Finance Committee hearing that sibutramine may be more dangerous than the conditions it is used for.

Between January 2003 and November 2005, a large randomized-controlled &quot;Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes&quot; (SCOUT) study with 10,742 patients examined whether or not sibutramine administered within a weight management program reduces the risk for cardiovascular complications in people at high risk for heart disease and concluded that use of silbutramine had a RR 1.16 for the primary outcome (composit of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, cardiac arrest, and CV death).

In April 2010 David Haslam (chairman of the National Obesity Forum) said in a dissenting article, &quot;Sibutramine: gone, but not forgotten&quot;, that the SCOUT study was flawed as it only covered high-risk patients and did not consider obese patients who did not have cardiovascular complications or similar contraindications.

On January 21, 2010, the European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of marketing authorizations for sibutramine based on the SCOUT study results.

In August 2010 the FDA added a new contraindication for patients over 65 years of age because clinical studies of sibutramine did not include sufficient numbers of such patients.

On October 8, 2010, the FDA recommended against continued prescribing because of unnecessary cardiovascular risks to patients, asking Abbott Laboratories to voluntarily withdraw. Abbott announced the same day that it was withdrawing sibutramine from the US market, citing concerns over minimal efficacy coupled with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

===Counterfeit weight-loss products, 2008–present===
On December 22, 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an alert to consumers naming 27 different products marketed as “dietary supplements” for weight loss, that illegally contain undisclosed amounts of sibutramine. In March 2009, Dieter Müller &quot;et al.&quot; published a study of sibutramine poisoning cases from similar Chinese &quot;herbal supplements&quot; sold in Europe, containing as much as twice the dosage of the legally licensed drug.

An additional 34 products were recalled by the FDA on April 22, 2009, further underscoring the risks associated with unregulated &quot;herbal supplements&quot; to unsuspecting persons. This concern is especially relevant to those with underlying medical conditions incompatible with undeclared pharmaceutical adulterants. In January 2010, a similar alert was issued for counterfeit versions of the over-the-counter weight loss drug Alli sold over the Internet. Instead of the active ingredient orlistat, the counterfeit drugs contain sibutramine, and at concentrations at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.

In March 2010 Health Canada advised the public that illegal &quot;Herbal Diet Natural&quot; had been found on the market, containing sibutramine, which is a prescription drug in Canada, without listing sibutramine as an ingredient. In October 2010 FDA notified consumers that &quot;Slimming Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient sibutramine, a prescription-only drug which is a stimulant. Sibutramine is not listed on the product label.&quot;

In October 2010 the MHRA in the UK issued a warning regarding &quot;Payouji tea&quot; and &quot;Pai You Guo Slim Capsules&quot; which were found to contain undeclared quantities of sibutramine.

On December 30, 2010, the FDA released a warning regarding &quot;Fruta Planta&quot; dietary products, which were found to contain undeclared amounts of sibutramine. The recall stated that &quot;there is NO SAFE formula on the US market and that all versions of Fruta Planta contain sibutramine. All versions of the formula are UNSAFE and should not be purchased from any source.&quot;

In 2011, some illegal weight loss products imported into Ireland have been found to contain sibutramine. In 2012, similar concerns were raised in Australia, where illegal imported supplements have been found to contain sibutramine, resulting in public alerts from Australia&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Administration.

In October 2011, the FDA warned that 20 brands of dietary supplements were tainted with sibutramine.

In a 2018 study the FDA found synthetic additives including sibutramine in over 700 diet supplements marketed as &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;herbal remedies&quot;.

On January 14, 2025, Tokyo metropolitan government issued a warning regarding &quot;Toki Slimming Candy&quot;, which was found to contain sibutramine. There were also several cases in Japan where unapproved products containing sibutramine led to adverse outcomes.

<doc id="1276622" wikidata="Q56483" url="?curid=1276622" title="Laki language">
<text>Laki (, ) is a vernacular that consists of two dialects; Pish-e Kuh Laki and Posht-e Kuh Laki. Laki has a disputed identity and is considered to be a dialect of Kurdish or of Luri, or a transitional dialect between them. It is considered a Kurdish dialect, by most linguists and is spoken chiefly in the area between Khorramabad and Kermanshah in Iran by about 680,000 native speakers.

== Geography ==
Laki is spoken in Iran and in Turkey. In Iran, the isogloss of Laki spans from Khorramabad to east of Kermanshah, from Holeylan to Harsin. It&#x27;s the main language in Selseleh, Delfan, Kuhdasht and Khawa counties in Lorestan Province, including Oshtorinan District of Borujerd County, and also around Malayer and Nahavand in Hamadan Province. In Kermanshah Province, it is the main language in Harsin County, Kangavar County, Sahneh County, and in the southern halves of Kermanshah County and Eslamabad-e Gharb County. There are also Laki enclaves in Khorasan, Kerman and around 100,000 speakers in 70 villages around Kelardasht in Mazandaran. In Gilan province, Laki is spoken by around 1,500 people.

In Turkey, the language is spoken by the Şêxbizin tribe, scattered around the country.

== Classification ==
The classification of Laki as a sub-dialect of Southern Kurdish or as a fourth dialect of Kurdish is unsettled, but the differences between Laki and the other Southern Kurdish dialects are minimal. However, linguist Fattah argues that Laki cannot be considered a dialect of Southern Kurdish since Laki is ergative and is thus a fourth Kurdish language.

Other linguists argue that Laki is closely related to Kurdish but refrain from deciding its place among the Northwestern Iranian languages.

Laki has also been classified as a Luri dialect, but speakers of Luri claim that Laki is &quot;difficult or impossible to understand&quot;. However most speakers of different Kurdish languages, such as Sorani and Kurmanji, cannot understand each other. Linguist Shahsavari points that Laki is sometimes seen as &#x27;a transitional dialect between Kurdish and Luri&#x27;.

== History ==

=== Oral literature ===
Two significant groups of Laki oral literature are religious oral literature and astronomical literature. The first group includes Shia oral hymns and Yarsan songs, while the second gives an expansive and colorful account of Laki narratives of astronomical events and their consequences, the power of the sun, moon, the week and tales on the stars. A third and less significant group of Laki oral literature are verses on nature and the daily life. In the folklore of rural areas, &quot;fal gərtən&quot; or &#x27;tell fortunes&#x27; are very important.

=== Written literature ===

The use of Laki in literary writing is a more recent phenomenon and has therefore not been considerably developed. Historically, the use was impeded by the status of Gorani as koiné among Kurds which meant that speakers of Laki wrote their poetry in Gorani. Nonetheless, some early Laki works include the quatrain &quot;al-shi&#x27;r bi-l-fahlawīya&quot; (year 716 in hijri) which was preserved in a 14th-century manuscript, and &quot;Jang-i Hamawan&quot; which was a freely adapted Laki version of the Shahnameh by Ferdowsi. Mele Perîşan (1356–1431) also wrote his diwan in Gorani influenced by Laki.

The most well-known manzuma in Laki is &quot;Darcenge&quot; written by Sayid Nushad Abu al-Wafa&#x27;i, a fellow of Sultan Sahak and contemporary of Nader Shah. The &quot;Darcenge&quot; contained questions concerning the events taking place in the world with sophisticated answers. This period also saw many Laki versions of the Kalâm-e Saranjâm.

In addition, there are many manuscripts titled &quot;Kule bad&quot; meaning &#x27;the continuous wind&#x27; scattered around the region. These manuscripts appeared numerously in the late 16th century and early 17th century and were used to express benediction on nature and to request a wind which was appropriate for agricultural reasons. Important names from the 18th to the 20th century include Najaf Kalhuri (1739–1799), Tirkamir (d. 1815), Yaqub Maydashti, Mila Manuchichr Kuliwand and Mila Haqq Ali Siyahpush.

==Laki phonology==

The phonology of Laki is identical to that of other Southern Kurdish dialects, which diverges from Kurmanji and Sorani by also having the , and .

<doc id="1276623" wikidata="Q2878909" url="?curid=1276623" title="Kiwi (shoe polish)">
<text>Kiwi is a global brand of shoe polish, originally developed in Australia in 1906 by William Ramsay. Kiwi has grown to be the dominant shoe polish in many countries since it was used by both the British and U.S. Armies in World War I. However it announced its exit from the UK market in 2022. Soon afterwards in 2023 Kiwi announced it will be ending the brand in the US by June 2024, sunsetting certain products before the 2023 year even ended. 

 the Kiwi brand is owned by S. C. Johnson.

==History==
The polish was originally made by an Australian company, which first marketed the product in 1906. William Ramsay and fellow Scottish expatriate in Australia, Hamilton McKellar, began making boot polish and other products in a small factory in Melbourne in 1904. While a number of older leather preserving products existed, including the Irish brand &quot;Punch&quot;, which was first made in 1851, and the German brand, &quot;Erdal&quot;, which went on sale in 1901, Kiwi&#x27;s introduction in 1906 made it the first shoe polish to resemble modern varieties, aimed primarily at inducing shine. Ramsay and McKellar launched an improved formula, marketing it in Melbourne as &quot;Kiwi Boot Polish&quot;. Ramsay loaded boxes of the product on to his horse and cart and sold it to farmers to protect their boots. Ramsay named it &quot;Kiwi&quot; after the flightless bird native to New Zealand, the home country of his wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek.

Kiwi was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world&#x27;s best. A range of colours became available, and exports began to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand.

A rival brand at the time was &quot;Cobra Boot Polish&quot;, based in Sydney. Cobra was noted for a series of cartoon advertisements in &quot;The Sydney Bulletin&quot;, starting in 1909, using a character called &quot;Chunder Loo of Akim Foo&quot;. (The Australian slang word &quot;chunder&quot;, meaning &quot;to vomit&quot;, possibly originated through the rhyming slang of &quot;Chunder Loo&quot; and &quot;spew&quot;.)

Its success in Australia was matched overseas after it was adopted by both the British and United States armies in World War I.

The spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the popular appeal of the kiwi as New Zealand&#x27;s national symbol.

==Corporate history==

===Australian ownership===
Over the years, Kiwi has been owned by a variety of corporations. For the first six decades of its existence, it was one of the iterations of an Australian corporation with Kiwi in its name, all based in the state of Victoria, including Kiwi Boot Polish Co. (1913–1916) and Kiwi Polish Co. (1916–1971). The company then joined with Nicholas International Ltd., a Melbourne-based pharmaceutical company producing international brands such as Aspro and Rennie. The new company was renamed Nicholas Kiwi.

===Manufacture in the UK===
In the UK, Kiwi polish was manufactured for many years at the company&#x27;s British headquarters in Ealing. That facility manufactured for the UK market and exported the Kiwi brand to much of Europe and the Middle East. In the mid-1970s, as part of a major streamlining, the UK factory was closed, and production was switched to France. The UK operation moved to Yateley becoming, effectively, a sales and marketing office, with distribution contracted to a third party.

In 1980, production for the UK market moved back to the UK, and was housed in a factory near Huddersfield. The UK head office was relocated to Maidstone, in Kent, where Kiwi had other product interests. Following a global merger with Nicholas Laboratories, the UK head office was again relocated to Slough, at the Nicholas building on the Bath Road.

===Sara Lee (1984–2011)===
In 1984, it was acquired by American-based Consolidated Foods Corporation (now Sara Lee Corporation), who eventually sold the Nicholas pharmaceutical products to Roche of Switzerland but kept the Kiwi range.

In 1991, a subsidiary of the Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee) acquired part of the shoe care business of Reckitt &amp; Colman, including the Cherry Blossom and Meltonian brands. Sara Lee already owned the Kiwi brand, among others. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994, to prevent it from becoming a monopoly. Since that ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom also investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry.

As of 2005 it was manufactured in Australia, Canada, Honduras, France, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

===S. C. Johnson (April 2011–present)===
On 4 April 2011, Sara Lee announced that it had completed its sale of its global shoe care business, in a majority of countries, to S. C. Johnson.

==Market share==
Kiwi has been the dominant shoe polish in many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States for much of its life. Kiwi remained the predominant shoe polish brand in most of the world, being sold in over 180 countries and holding a 53% market share worldwide. In Malaysia and Singapore, Kiwi has become such a household name for shoe polish that the word &quot;kiwi&quot; has been genericised into a verb in the Malay language, meaning &quot;to polish one&#x27;s shoes&quot;.

In December 2022, S. C. Johnson announced that it had exited the UK shoe care market, blaming the effect of changes in work patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and the rise of casual shoes that do not require polishing.

<doc id="1276637" wikidata="Q846346" url="?curid=1276637" title="Ford Galaxy">
<text>The Ford Galaxy is a seven-seater car produced by Ford of Europe from June 1995 to April 2023. Considered in the motor industry to be a large multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), it was the first Ford-brand MPV produced and marketed outside of North America, the model line is currently in its third generation. Sharing its platform architecture with the Ford Mondeo, the Galaxy was developed alongside the Ford S-Max; the model line is slotted between the Connect and Custom variants of the Ford Tourneo/Transit model family.

In contrast to the American-designed Ford Aerostar and Chrysler Voyager (both imported to Europe), the Galaxy is configured with four sedan-style doors (in line with the Renault Espace).


== First generation (V191; 1995) ==
The first Galaxy was designed as a joint venture product between Ford and the Volkswagen Group. Produced at the joint-venture AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, Portugal, the vehicle was badge-engineered to create three vehicles: the Ford Galaxy; by Volkswagen as the Volkswagen Sharan; and by SEAT as the Alhambra. Production started in May 1995.

The Galaxy used predominantly Volkswagen Group mechanicals, most notably the 2.8-litre VR6 petrol engine from the top versions of the Volkswagen Golf, as well as Volkswagen Group&#x27;s 1.9-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbo-diesel unit. Initially only the 2.0-litre inline-four petrol version used a Ford powerplant – this derived from the Ford I4 DOHC engine. In later years, this unit was supplemented by a 2.3-litre 16 valve version first seen in the facelifted Ford Scorpio. This engine was transversely mounted as opposed to longitudinal mounting like in the Scorpio.

The 2.8-litre VR6 model was also available with an optional four-wheel-drive system, however this did not reappear on the second generation.

All of the VW Group sourced engines were supplied with &quot;Ford&quot; badges on the rocker covers, despite being VW Group designs. All automatic transmissions were VW Group AG4 boxes, but manual gearboxes on all engines were VXT75 five speeds (modified versions of the trusted Ford MTX-75 five speed set-up to suit the transverse engine layout).

The original interior used a mix of both Ford and VW Group components, using a Volkswagen Golf-derived instrument pack, and most of the switchgear, while the curved fascia moulding was of Ford design, heavily reminiscent of that used in the Ford Mondeo.

===Public reaction===
In 1999, the MkI Ford Galaxy was rated in a &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine survey as the least satisfying car in the United Kingdom, though 12,233 people bought a Galaxy in the previous year, which was twice the market share of its nearest rival, according to a Ford&#x27;s spokesman. In the UK, Ford Galaxy sold more than Volkswagen Sharan and was the best selling MPV.

=== Trims and facelifts ===
When the car was launched in 1995, there were two trim levels; the Aspen and the GLX, as well as the Ghia which launched a few months later. In 1996, the 4x4 powertrain was available, the Aspen was updated with body coloured bumpers and updated hubcaps, as well as the launch of the Ghia X which was powered by the 2.3 petrol as standard instead of the 2.0 like that on the standard Ghia - and it had a few more standard features like air conditioning and front fog lights. In early 1997, the Ultima was also launched, designed to be more luxurious than the Ghia. It had 6 leather captains chairs, as well as a front passenger airbag, traction control and different alloy wheels (all as standard features). However, it never sold very well and approximately only around 125 were on the road at its peak. Then, in 1999, Ford introduced the new LX and Zetec trim styles which replaced the Aspen and GLX models.

In August 2000, the Galaxy received a facelift with new exterior (incorporating New Edge) and interior styling including a new dashboard. The updated trims included the LX, the Zetec and Ghia. Contrary to the name, the Zetec was not available with a Zetec engine, but with the 1.9 TDI engine which was supplied by Volkswagen, as well as Ford&#x27;s own 2.3 petrol. In 2004, the Galaxy received a very minor facelift with new taillights, a new lower front grille and a few differences to some trims. As well as this, the Silver special edition was launched alongside the Mondeo Silver, both having alloy wheels and only being available in 3 different silver colours.

==Second generation (2006)==

The second generation Galaxy was introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, and went on sale alongside the Ford S-Max (which had a lower rear roofline, external cosmetic differences and only child seats in the third row) in June 2006.

The new Galaxy is larger than its predecessor, and is a four pillar vehicle of Ford design, with no Volkswagen Group content (Ford sold its stake in AutoEuropa back to the Volkswagen Group the year before). No longer produced at the AutoEuropa plant in Portugal, Europe&#x27;s replacement Galaxy is assembled at a newly re equipped plant alongside the Mondeo in Genk, Belgium. With the S-Max catering to customers who require a sport-oriented multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), Ford was able to expand the Galaxy in every dimension without losing sales in size conscious Europe.

Due to its size, Ford was unable to design the Galaxy using a full Kinetic Design format. However, Ford states that the Mk III Galaxy has &#x27;elements&#x27; of Kinetic Design, such as its trapezoidal grille, large wheelarches and angular headlights. The vehicle has no spare wheel; instead an aerosol foam sealant is provided to seal punctures until a new tyre can be purchased.

Only Ford&#x27;s own engines are used, all diesels being from the Duratorq family of engines in and 1.8-litre format, and also and 2.0 TDCi versions, with 2.2 TDCi for more power. Two petrol engines are now offered, there is the &quot;1.6T 160PS EcoBoost Start/Stop&quot; and the &quot;2.0 203 PS EcoBoost 

However the 1.6-litre Ecoboost engine has been criticized by the Independent writer Jamie Merrill. He describes the engine as not powerful enough and should have been left in the smaller cars.

In the United Kingdom, the Mk III Galaxy was available in Edge, Zetec, and Ghia trim levels. In February 2008, Ford added the Titanium high level trim in common with the Focus, C-MAX, Kuga, Mondeo and S-MAX ranges. The Titanium model is specified to the same level as the Ghia but adds a &#x27;techno&#x27; feel. At the same time, the availability of a 2.2 TDCi engine option (joint design with PSA) was announced. The current trim levels available in the United Kingdom (November 2011) are Zetec, Titanium and Titanium X.

The Ford Galaxy also comes with many features such as Home Safe Lighting, Quickclear heated windscreen and a cooled passenger glove box.

One major selling point of the Galaxy and S-MAX is the &quot;FoldFlatSystem&quot;. This design allows the second and third row seats to fold flat into the floor, although this change in seating design reduces the load carrying capacity of the vehicle.

This model of car is known as the main vehicle on the British television series &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, which replaces the Vauxhall Zafira the family had in the older series.
== Third generation (CD390; 2015) ==

After its sibling, the Ford S-Max, was presented at the 2014 Paris Motor Show, the all-new Galaxy went on sale in mid-2015.

The Galaxy is available with the same range of engines as the S-Max, namely one diesel (in four states of tune) and two petrol variants. The petrol 1.5 SCTi Ecoboost has 160 hp, and the larger 2.0 SCTi has 240 hp, but can only be mated to Ford&#x27;s Powershift automatic gearbox. At launch, Ford expected only two percent of United Kingdom sales to be petrol models.

All the diesels average over 50 mpg – the most economical being the 2.0 TDCi Duratorq 120, which manages 57mpg. Both the 2.0 TDCi 150 and 180 versions come with either a six-speed manual gearbox or the Powershift auto – the 180 hp version can also be specced with AWD. The range topping Bi-Turbo 2.0 TDCi 210 comes with the Powershift gearbox only, and can accelerate from 0 to 60 in under nine seconds.

The trim levels, mirroring those available in the S-Max, Mondeo and Edge, include Zetec, Titanium and Titanium X.

=== Mid-cycle facelift ===
Ford updated the Galaxy for the 2020 model year. It received a new front grille and bumpers with a similar design as the Mondeo, Focus, Fiesta, Puma and Kuga. The Galaxy also received the Vignale version, a new automatic transmission and an updated infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

=== Hybrid update ===
In late 2021, Ford stopped selling the standard petrol and diesel models, only selling it with one engine choice, a 2.5-litre hybrid Duratec - producing 190PS with a Durashift CVT transmission.

=== Discontinuation ===
In January 2022, Ford announced plans to discontinue the Galaxy after 27 years of production, stopping accepting orders for the minivan in favour of realisation of existing ones. Afterwards the cars will be axed from the European lineup without direct successor.

==Reviews==
The 2012 Ford Galaxy was reviewed by &quot;What Car?&quot;, and was given 4 out of 5 stars. They added that the Galaxy was more fun to drive than most MPVs.

&quot;Top Gear&quot; also reviewed the car and gave it 7/10 and added it looked great all around.

<text>Eggheads is a British quiz show produced by 12 Yard. It was first broadcast in November 2003 chaired by Dermot Murnaghan. In 2008, Jeremy Vine became joint chair, and subsequently sole chair. The show has inspired three spinoff series: &quot;Are You an Egghead?&quot; (2008), &quot;Revenge of the Egghead&quot; (2014) and &quot;Make Me an Egghead&quot; (2016). There have also been episodes of the regular series featuring teams of celebrities in their own short series, with their own rolling prize fund.

==History==
The show began in 2003 with Dermot Murnaghan as the presenter. From 2008, Jeremy Vine presented when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series. After the spin-off show finished, Murnaghan and Vine continued to host the series on a rotational basis, with Murnaghan typically hosting the first half of each series and Vine taking over for the second half. From series 16, Vine became the sole presenter.

The series originally broadcast on BBC One at lunchtime beginning in November 2003, and later moved to a primetime slot on BBC Two from 2005 to 2020.

On 31 December 2016, the quiz made a brief cameo in BBC One’s &quot;Peter Pan Goes Wrong&quot; TV special.

On 12 March 2021, after a year&#x27;s hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced on Jeremy Vine&#x27;s titular Channel 5 programme that the quiz show would be moving to Channel 5 with Vine and the most recent Eggheads returning. The new series premiered on 4 October 2021, and alongside a studio change, only four Eggheads and four contestants now played at a time with a reduction to three one-on-one rounds to accommodate advert breaks (due to Channel 5&#x27;s status as a commercial broadcaster). Due to social distancing restrictions, the desks were lengthened and perspex screens were added. The first challengers, playing for charity, were Jay&#x27;s Virtual Quiz, who had become a fundraising hit on social media during the pandemic. An additional Egghead (Olav Bjortomt) was featured on the opening credits and competed from week two.

In May 2024, it was revealed that the show has been permanently shelved and Vine said that &#x27;he hasn&#x27;t filmed an episode for over a year&#x27;.

==Format==
In each episode, a team of five quiz and game show champions (the &quot;Eggheads&quot;) is challenged by a team of five contestants for prize money. If the challengers lose, then £1,000 is added to the prize money fund until the Eggheads are beaten, when the prize will revert to £1,000. The most prize money that has been won is £75,000, in 2007.

Some teams have been reduced to one contestant for the final round, but have still beaten five Eggheads. Occasionally, one remaining Egghead will beat five challengers. Only once have the Eggheads lost four games in succession and only four times has a team of all five challengers won the final round. Since 2021, it has been four Eggheads against four challengers, instead of the previous five.

===Rounds===
The show is played in five rounds. The first four &#x27;one-on-one&#x27; &#x27;elimination&#x27; rounds each focus on one subject category (of nine) while the final &#x27;conferring&#x27; round tests general knowledge. In the first four rounds, the challengers choose a member of their own team to play, and an Egghead against whom they wish to compete. The players for that round then leave the studio to go into the &quot;Question Room&quot;. The challenger is given the choice of going first or second. Both players are asked in turn three multiple-choice questions. If there is no winner, the round goes into sudden death with no choices given for answers. Since the show moved to Channel 5, there have only been four players per team, and thus only three &#x27;one-on-one&#x27; rounds.

The player who wins each round earns a place in the final round, while losing players are eliminated from the game.

The final general knowledge round is then played between non-eliminated Eggheads and challengers with a similar question format to the previous rounds, with the exception that if more than one remains on a team they may confer. If the challengers win they take the prize money; if the Eggheads win, the prize money is increased by £1,000 for the next quiz.

===Subjects===
There are nine (formerly eight) possible subjects for the first rounds. They are:
*Arts &amp; Books (2003–present)
*Entertainment (2003–2008)
*Film &amp; Television (2008–present)
*Food &amp; Drink (2003–present)
*Geography (2003–present)
*History (2003–present)
*Music (2008–present)
*Politics (2003–present)
*Science (2003–present)
*Sport (2003–present)
Music and Film &amp; Television were introduced in Autumn 2008 through a split of the Entertainment category. Subjects can appear in any order, although at least one of Sport, Music or Film &amp; Television will appear in every episode. Despite the splitting of the Entertainment category, Music and Film &amp; Television can appear in the same episode, sometimes consecutively.

==&quot;Eggheads&quot;==
In the first eight series, the team consisted of only five Eggheads who each appeared in every episode and did not rotate. At the end of 2008, a sixth Egghead was added and appearances rotated. From series 15, five of eight possible Eggheads appear each episode, and later in 2016, two brand-new Eggheads (one male and one female) joined the panel after a spin-off series entitled &quot;Make Me an Egghead&quot;. Currently, there are 7 Eggheads (5 male and 2 female): Kevin Ashman, Barry Simmons, Pat Gibson, Steve Cooke, Olav Bjortomt, Lisa Thiel and Beth Webster and they currently appear on Channel 5.

==Spin-offs==
===&quot;Are You an Egghead?&quot;===

On 20 October 2008, a spin-off called &quot;Are You an Egghead?&quot; debuted on BBC Two. The first series was won by Barry Simmons and ran from 20 October to 2 December 2008 while the second series was won by Pat Gibson and ran from 12 October to 23 November 2009.

===&quot;Revenge of the Egghead&quot;===
On 24 February 2014, a new spin-off series of &quot;Eggheads&quot; was launched called &quot;Revenge of the Egghead&quot;. It was presented by Jeremy Vine and saw the return of CJ de Mooi, who left &quot;Eggheads&quot; in 2012. In each episode, de Mooi faced a team of five contestants hoping to win thousands of pounds. The series ran for a 6-week period, between 24 February and 4 April 2014. Lisa Thiel appeared on the show as part of a winning team before becoming an Egghead herself shortly afterwards.

====Main game====
Each contestant, in turn, is asked a general knowledge question. If their answer is right, £200 is added to the prize fund but if their answer is wrong and de Mooi knows their answer is wrong, he presses a red button in front of him to answer the same question. If he gets it wrong and the contestant gets it right, an additional £100 is added to the prize fund. If he gets it right, the contestant is asked a multiple-choice question by de Mooi. If they get it right, gameplay continues as normal but if they get it wrong, they lose one of their two lives. If a contestant loses both of their lives, they are out of the game. When time runs out, the surviving players move on to the final round, along with the total number of lives remaining for all players, for a chance to win an equal share of the prize fund.

====Final round====
The final round starts out with de Mooi answering ten general knowledge questions. The number of questions he gets right becomes the target that the team has to beat. The team can confer on every question. Every wrong answer means that the team loses one of their lives and if they lose all of their lives, they leave with nothing but if they beat the target, they win an equal share of the prize fund.

===&quot;Make Me an Egghead&quot;===

A 25-part spin-off series ran from 22 August to 23 September 2016, with the search for two new members for the Eggheads line-up: one male, one female. The series was won by Steve Cooke and Beth Webster.

<doc id="1276641" wikidata="Q64856" url="?curid=1276641" title="Eduard von Simson">
<text>Martin Sigismund Eduard von Simson (10 November 1810 – 2 May 1899) was a German jurist and distinguished liberal politician of the Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire, who served as President of the Frankfurt Parliament as well as the first President of the German Parliament and of the Imperial Court. He was ennobled by Kaiser Frederick III in 1888.

==Education==

Eduard Simson was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, in a Jewish family. The family converted to Protestantism in 1823. After the usual course at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; of his native town, he entered its university in 1826 as a student of jurisprudence, and specially of Roman law. He continued his studies at Berlin and Bonn, and, having graduated &quot;doctor juris&quot;, attended lectures at the École de Droit in Paris. Returning to Königsberg in 1831 he established himself as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in Roman law, becoming two years later extraordinary, and in 1836 ordinary, professor in the faculty of the university.

==National Assembly==
Like many other distinguished German jurists, &quot;pari passu&quot; with his professorial activity, Simson followed the judicial branch of the legal profession, and, passing rapidly through the subordinate stages of auscultator and assessor, became adviser (&quot;Rath&quot;) to the Landgericht in 1846. In this year he stood for the representation of Königsberg in the National Assembly at Frankfurt am Main, and on his election was immediately appointed secretary, and in the course of the same year became successively its vice-president and president.

==Frederick William IV==
In Berlin on 3 April 1849, Simson appeared in his capacity of president at the head of a deputation of the Frankfurt Parliament to announce to King Frederick William IV his election as German Emperor by the representatives of the people. The king, either apprehensive of a rupture with the Austrian Empire, or fearing detriment to the prerogatives of the Prussian crown should he accept this dignity at the hands of a democracy, refused the offer. Simson, bitterly disappointed at the outcome of his mission, resigned his seat in the Frankfurt Parliament, but in the summer of the same year was elected deputy for Königsberg in the popular chamber of the Prussian Landtag. Here he soon made his mark as one of the best orators in that assembly. A member of the short-lived Erfurt Parliament of 1850, he was again summoned to the presidential chair.

==Prussian Landtag==
On the dissolution of the Erfurt assembly, Simson retired from politics, and for the next few years devoted himself exclusively to his academic and judicial duties. It was not until 1859 that he re-entered public life, when he was elected deputy for Königsberg in the lower chamber of the Prussian Landtag, of which he was president in 1860 and 1861. In the first of these years he attained high judicial office as president of the court of appeal at Frankfurt (Oder). In 1867, having been elected a member of the constituent assembly of the North German Confederation, he again occupied the presidential chair, as he did also in the first regular North German Reichstag and the Reichstag of the German Empire which succeeded it.

==William I==
On 18 December 1870, Simson arrived at the head of a deputation in the German headquarters at Versailles to offer the imperial crown to the king of Prussia in the name of the newly elected Reichstag. The conditions under which Prussia might justly aspire to the hegemony in Germany at last appeared to have been accomplished; no obstacles, as in 1849, were in the way of the acceptance of the crown by the leading sovereign of the confederation, and on 18 January 1871 King William I of Prussia was proclaimed with all pomp German Emperor in the Salle des Glaces at Palace of Versailles.

==Reichsgericht==
Simson continued as president of the Reichstag until 1874, when he retired from the chair, and in 1877 resigned his seat in the Diet, but at Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s urging, accepted the presidency of the supreme court of justice (Reichsgericht). He filled this high office with great distinction until his final retirement from public life in 1891.

His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

<text>Bob Bertles (6 March 1939 – 30 December 2024) was an Australian jazz alto, tenor and baritone saxophonist and bandleader.

==Life and career==
Bertles was born in Melbourne on 6 March 1939. A self-taught musician, Bertles in the late 1950s and early 60s was a member of the developing modern jazz scene that grew out of venues like the Mocambo in Newtown and the El Rocco Jazz Cellar in Sydney&#x27;s Kings Cross.

Active in clubs, on TV, as a session musician and on the pop-rock scene, he toured with Johnny O&#x27;Keefe.

In 1967 Bertles temporarily joined Sydney-based rock-soul band Max Merritt &amp; The Meteors. Only weeks after joining, Bertles, Merritt and drummer Stewie Speer narrowly escaped death after their van collided head-on with a truck on the way to a country dance; all three were seriously injured and Bertles was left with a permanent limp. In 1974, after the group split, Bertles joined Ian Carr&#x27;s Nucleus.

In later years Bertles toured Europe extensively, joined the orchestra for the Australian production of the stage musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, where he met his future wife, theatre performer Nancye Hayes.

In addition to regular concerts, festivals, session work, and touring, Bertles&#x27; later projects included recording and live performances with Sydney&#x27;s renowned Ten Part Invention.

Bertles died on 30 December 2024, at the age of 85.

<doc id="1276650" wikidata="Q4970925" url="?curid=1276650" title="British Rail DP2">
<text>DP2, meaning Development Prototype number 2, was a prototype [[List of British Rail power classifications#Type 4|Type 4]] mainline diesel locomotive, built by English Electric in 1962. DP2 was effectively the prototype for the later ; it trialled the engine and electronic systems later used in that class of locomotives.

Externally DP2 was visually similar to a Class 55 &quot;Deltic&quot; locomotive, as it used a modified Deltic bodyshell, but internally it had a single engine of a different type to the twin-engined Deltics. DP2 was used firstly in trials, and then in ordinary service until 1967, when it was wrecked in a serious accident at Thirsk.

==History==
===Design===
The locomotive was built in 1962 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. As the Deltics were then in production, it was decided to produce the locomotive on the same production line; the bodyshell used for DP2 reputedly being the eighteenth made. While DP2 looked like a Deltic in outline, there were many detail differences; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end, and the single roof fan as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the Deltics. These differences revealed that DP2 was totally different from the twin-engined Deltics internally, having only a single prime mover and generator. The loco was later updated with electronic control systems to become the forerunner of the Class 50.

It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with an English Electric 16CSVT engine of . It had a maximum speed of and weighed . It was initially painted in standard BR Brunswick Green livery and later (from 1965) in two-tone green livery with a light green lower bodyside band.

===Operation===
Its first test service was on 2 May 1962, running light from Newton-le-Willows to Chester and back. Its final test with Vulcan Foundry was a fast running test six days later, with a 15-coach train of between Crewe and Penrith, passing Tebay at . On 11 May, the locomotive was lent to the London Midland Region for crew training where it undertook a few Crewe–Birmingham runs.

From 14 May 1962, BR tested it on regular London Midland Region services out of London Euston and later on the Eastern Region from London King&#x27;s Cross. Following its first major overhaul in mid-1965 and clad in new two-tone green Deltic livery, it was used on the Sheffield Pullman workings until 1966. It was fitted with electronic tractive effort and wheel-slip control which gave it superior acceleration to a Deltic, in spite of possessing only 82% of the power. It was placed in a Deltic Diagram covering the 01.32 King&#x27;s Cross - Edinburgh and the 22.50 Edinburgh - King&#x27;s Cross, These duties were performed quite punctually and without complaint. In August 1966, it was derailed at station.

===Accident===
On 31 July 1967 it was involved in a serious accident at Thirsk, colliding at speed with the de-railed Cliffe (Kent) to Uddingston (Glasgow) cement train. DP2 sustained severe front and left hand side damage, and was taken to York shed where it remained sheeted over. The damage proved to be so great that it was considered uneconomical to repair. It was withdrawn from BR service in September 1967 and moved to the Vulcan Foundry where it was stored until it was dismantled in 1968, its reusable parts being provided to the Class 50 pool of spares. Its engine initially went to D417/50 017 &#x27;Royal Oak&#x27;, but ended its working days in D437/50037 &#x27;Illustrious&#x27;.

== Models ==
The DP2 &quot;Prototype Deltic&quot; is being made as a kit and ready-to-run in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models.
In 2012, Heljan introduced ready-to-run OO gauge models of DP2 in both liveries.

<doc id="1276659" wikidata="Q1195474" url="?curid=1276659" title="Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception () is a late 19th-century English Gothic revival church that serves as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong. It is located in the Mid-Levels area of the city at 16 Caine Road.

Groundbreaking and construction of the cathedral began in 1883 after the previous cathedral, on Wellington Street, was destroyed by fire. Built from brick and stone, the new cathedral was designed by the London-based architectural firm Crawley and Company. The church opened on 7 December 1888, the day before the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and was consecrated in 1938. Three years later, it was damaged during the Battle of Hong Kong, but remained untouched throughout the subsequent Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. At the turn of the century, the cathedral underwent an extensive and costly program of refurbishment, which was completed in 2002. The cathedral is listed as a Grade I historic building by the Hong Kong Government.

==History==
===Original structure (1843–1859)===
After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the colony soon became a popular stopover for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. Within the next few years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, partly due to the emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.

===Second cathedral (1859)===

In 1859, just sixteen years after it was built, the church was destroyed by fire. This was not uncommon, however, as devastating fires frequently plagued the developing colony, and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site. It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade. However, the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where the church was situated became more overcrowded with the rapid growth of Hong Kong at the time, and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary. As a result, plans were made for a new church on a more elevated ground in Mid-Levels, located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.

===Present-day cathedral===

A new site for the cathedral was selected above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine and the cornerstone of the new church was laid on 8 December 1883. Crawley and Company of London were hired to be the architects and five years later, construction was completed. The church opened on 7 December 1888, the vigil of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and was blessed one day later. The construction of the cathedral cost US$15,400, and since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until 8 December 1938, exactly fifty years after it first opened. The ceremony was officiated by the vicar apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico Valtorta, the bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the bishop emeritus of Canton; three of the cathedral&#x27;s altars were also consecrated.

During the Second World War, the cathedral suffered damage on its anniversary in 1941, when a Japanese shell was dropped onto it during the Battle of Hong Kong. However, it survived the war relatively unscathed due to a decree made a century before. When the mission in Hong Kong was first established in 1841, Pope Pius IX ruled that, although the colony was under British rule, the Prefecture Apostolic should remain under the administration of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), a missionary society from Italy. As a result, the Japanese treated the cathedral as being under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Italy, with whom they were not at war. Because of this, the cathedral was spared from being ransacked and plundered by the occupying forces and its archives were preserved better than other churches throughout Hong Kong, having been left &quot;relatively unscathed.&quot;

After the conclusion of the war, the cathedral underwent a series of renovations. The roof – which was previously made of timber – was replaced with a concrete one in 1952 due to damage from termites. The reordering of the sanctuary took place in 1969 after the Second Vatican Council, in which the main altar was moved to the cathedral&#x27;s crossing. In 1988, air conditioning was installed and the roof underwent reparation.

Significant leaks in the roof were reported in 1997 and a massive restoration project took place. This entailed fixing the roof, repainting the walls and the niche housing the statue of the Immaculate Conception, replacing tiles, enhancing the lighting and sound system and installing new stained glass windows in the Chapel of Our Lord&#x27;s Passion, which was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs. The renovation was completed on 8 December 2002 and cost a total of US$1.1 million. The project&#x27;s success in preserving the building&#x27;s heritage resulted in the cathedral being given an honourable mention at the 2003 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation and presented with the award on its anniversary in 2003.

The cathedral holds a Red Mass every other year for the Judiciary of Hong Kong, alternating with St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in hosting the annual opening of the Assizes.

==Architecture==
===Interior===

The cathedral, built in an English Gothic style, is cruciform in the shape of the Latin cross. The exterior walls of the church were built from brick and stone, while its base and columns were made of granite. Its dimensions are long, wide and tall, with the tower at the centre rising to .

===Altar of St. Joseph===
Located to the right of the main altar and sanctuary is the side altar of St. Joseph. It was given to the cathedral by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and the donation was facilitated by Joseph Mary Sala, an expatriate living in Hong Kong who was from the nobility of Italy. It is adorned by the royal coat of arms of the House of Savoy; this conspicuous symbol of Italy was said to have helped the cathedral identify itself as Italian rather than British, and thus, remain untouched throughout the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, as the Kingdom of Italy and Empire of Japan were both signatories to the Tripartite Pact.

===Altar of the Sacred Heart===
Located to the left of the main altar is the side altar of the Sacred Heart. It was previously used as the high altar of the original cathedral at Wellington Street. It now houses the Blessed Sacrament – serving as the cathedral&#x27;s main tabernacle after the removal of the high altar in 1969 – and is reserved for Eucharistic adoration.

===Chapel of Our Lord&#x27;s Passion (now Chapel of Chinese Martyrs)===
Located to the right of the cathedral&#x27;s sacristy is the side chapel of Our Lord&#x27;s Passion. Given by J.J. Braga, a parishioner from Portugal, it was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs after the 1997–2002 renovation. The chapel was chosen out of the four to commemorate the then-newly canonised saints because it was the most thematically similar, in that the martyrs gave up their lives for the faith, emulating Jesus&#x27; sacrifice to save mankind. New stained glass windows were installed depicting the saints.

===Crypt===
A crypt was constructed beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 to house the remains of former bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two vicar apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and five of the six deceased bishops – Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei, and John Baptist Wu. Bianchi&#x27;s remains were interred later than the others (apart from Wu) due to the fact that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted. Wu&#x27;s remains were interred in September 2022, twenty years after his death, while the remains of Michael Yeung are buried at St. Michael&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery in Happy Valley.

The inspiration for the crypt came from the design of a traditional Chinese family house, which would contain the remains of ancestors. The bishop at the time, Joseph Cardinal Zen, felt that the crypt would be a &quot;symbolic move to inherit the teachings of previous generations in order to inspire future ones.&quot; Because the cathedral is a Grade I historic building, prior approval had to be obtained from the Buildings Department before any construction work could be carried out.

==Treasures==
===Relics of the Chinese Martyrs===
Shortly after the canonisation of the 120 Chinese Martyrs on 1 October 2000, the relics of sixteen of them were placed at the Chinese Martyrs&#x27; Chapel (formerly the Chapel of Our Lord&#x27;s Passion). They are stored in a relic box – designed locally by Sister Paola Yue – that is situated at the foot of the side altar.

===Relic of Pope John Paul II===
In November 2011, a lock of John Paul II&#x27;s hair was brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff. The diocese had earlier requested this, since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope&#x27;s longtime dream of visiting China. He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to the longstanding tensions and strained relations between China and the Holy See. Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house a relic of John Paul II. It is currently displayed in the same chapel as the bishops&#x27; crypt.

===Relic of Blessed Gabriele Allegra===
The relic of Blessed Gabriele Allegra, being the bone from his right middle finger, was placed at the Chinese Martyrs&#x27; Chapel. He was known for accomplishing the first complete translation of the Catholic Bible into the Chinese language.

<doc id="1276662" wikidata="Q47946" url="?curid=1276662" title="Henry Morgenthau Sr.">
<text>Henry Morgenthau (; April 26, 1856 – November 25, 1946) was a German-born American lawyer and businessman, best known for his role as the ambassador to the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Morgenthau was one of the most prominent Americans who spoke about the Greek genocide and the Armenian genocide of which he stated, &quot;I am firmly convinced that this is the greatest crime of the ages.&quot;

Morgenthau was the father of the politician Henry Morgenthau Jr. His grandchildren include Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney of Manhattan for 35 years, and Barbara W. Tuchman, a historian who won the Pulitzer Prize for her book &quot;The Guns of August&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Morgenthau was born the ninth of 11 living children, in Mannheim, Baden (present-day Baden-Württemberg, Germany), in 1856 into an Ashkenazi Jewish family. He was the son of Lazarus and Babette (Guggenheim) Morgenthau. His father was a successful cigar manufacturer who had cigar factories at Mannheim, Lorsch, and Heppenheim, employing as many as 1,000 people (Mannheim had a population of 21,000 during this period). His business suffered a severe financial setback during the American Civil War, due to an 1862 tobacco tariff on imports, which closed German tobacco exports to the US for good.

The Morgenthau family immigrated to New York in 1866. There, despite considerable savings, his father was not able to re-establish himself in business. His development and marketing of various inventions, as well as his investments in other enterprises, failed. Lazarus Morgenthau staved off failure and stabilized his income by becoming a fundraiser for Jewish houses of worship. Henry attended City College of New York, where he received his BA, and later Columbia Law School.

Morgenthau initially built a successful career as a lawyer. During his life he served as a leader of the Reform Jewish community in New York. 

==Business career==
He began his career as a lawyer, but he made a substantial fortune in real estate investments. In 1898, he acquired 41 lots on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side from William Waldorf Astor for $850,000. A few years later, he led a syndicate that bought a swath of undeveloped land in Washington Heights around 181st Street, anticipating the construction of the first subway through the area. In 1899 he left his law practice and became president of the Central Realty, Bond &amp; Trust Company. He was president of the Henry Morgenthau Company from 1905 to 1913. 

Morgenthau married Josephine Sykes in 1882 and they had four children: Helen, Alma, Henry Jr. and Ruth. His daughter Helen - a noted garden writer who broadcast on radio &amp; television and lectured on horticulture - married Mortimer J. Fox an architect, banker and landscape artist. His daughter Alma - an art collector and patron of the arts &amp; music - married investment banker, art collector and philanthropist Maurice Wertheim. His daughter Ruth married banker and philanthropist George Washington Naumburg She was also a civic leader supporting the arts and music. Ruth founded Fountain House, a home in NYC to assist those with schizophrenia and men leaving jail. It was a residence that pioneered providing psychological counseling to people, and developed the novel concept of looking after the community&#x27;s mental health. She was also a board member of the Manhattan School of Music, and there she established a fund to assist troubled students at the school, which still operates. In Pound Ridge, NY she co-founded the town&#x27;s library and gave it an additional reading room, and then at her death, she donated the Henry Morgenthau Preserve, Pound Ridge, NY, in her father&#x27;s memory.

A nephew of Henry&#x27;s, Robert E. Simon, (1877-1935) worked directly with Morgenthau, prior to and in his real estate business [Henry Morgenthau &amp; Co] for fourteen years (1905-1919). But his work in real estate, with Henry &amp; others, continued until his early death. Highlights include when Henry &amp; Robert advised and assisted Adolph Ochs, a dear family friend of Henry&#x27;s, in the purchase of Longacre Square in 1902. The site became Times Square with a new building there for the newspaper (1903-05). A second highlight is Robert Simon&#x27;s purchase of Carnegie Hall from Louise Whitfield Carnegie in 1925. Ownership was retained until Lincoln Center&#x27;s Philharmonic /Avery Fisher/ now David Geffen Hall construction was agreed upon and soon opened. Coupled with those changes, were the NY Philharmonic&#x27;s transferred location to the new hall (1962). 

So, Robert E. Simon Jr. then sold Carnegie Hall in 1960. He substantially reduced the price of the Carnegie Hall sale, [by $500,000] to help Issac Stern&#x27;s committee and NYC purchase and save the building. Simon then used the funds yielded to buy and construct Reston, VA - [name came from / Robert E. Simon&#x27;s town] Reston pioneered the inventive use of shared open space, and it explored a breaking of the mold and formulaic approach for suburban development, up to that time. 

==Political career==
Morgenthau&#x27;s career enabled him to contribute handsomely to President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s election campaign in 1912. He had first met Wilson in 1911 at a dinner celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Free Synagogue society and the two &quot;seem to have bonded&quot;, marking the &quot;turning point in Morgenthau&#x27;s political career&quot;. His role in American politics grew more pronounced in later months. Although he did not gain the chairmanship of Wilson&#x27;s campaign finance committee, Morgenthau was offered the position of ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. He had hoped for a cabinet post as well, but was not successful in gaining one.

===Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire===
As an early Wilson supporter, Morgenthau assumed that Wilson would appoint him to a cabinet-level position, but the new president had other plans for him. Like other prominent Jewish Americans (Oscar Straus and Solomon Hirsch before him), Morgenthau was appointed as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Wilson&#x27;s assumption that Jews somehow represented a bridge between Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians rankled Morgenthau; in reply, Wilson assured him that the Porte in Constantinople &quot;was the point at which the interest of American Jews in the welfare of the Jews of Palestine is focused, and it is almost indispensable that I have a Jew in that post&quot;. Though no Zionist himself, Morgenthau cared &quot;fervidly&quot; about the plight of his co-religionists. He initially rejected the position, but following a trip to Europe, and with the encouragement of his pro-Zionist friend Rabbi Stephen Wise, he reconsidered his decision and accepted Wilson&#x27;s offer. Appointed as U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1913, he served in this position until 1916.

Although the safety of American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, mostly Christian missionaries and Jews, loomed large early in his ambassadorship, Morgenthau said that he was most preoccupied by the Armenian Question. After the outbreak of war in 1914, the U.S. remained neutral, so the American Embassy – and by extension Morgenthau – additionally represented many of the Allies&#x27; interests in Constantinople, since they had withdrawn their diplomatic missions after the beginning of hostilities. As Ottoman authorities began the Armenian genocide in 1914–1915, the American consuls residing in different parts of the Empire flooded Morgenthau&#x27;s desk with reports nearly every hour, documenting the massacres and deportation marches taking place. Faced with the accumulating evidence, he officially informed the U.S. government of the activities of the Ottoman government and asked Washington to intervene.

The American government however, not wanting to get dragged into disputes, remained a neutral power in the conflict at the time and voiced little official reaction. Morgenthau held high-level meetings with the leaders of the Ottoman Empire to help alleviate the position of the Armenians, but the Turks waived and ignored his protestations. He famously admonished the Ottoman Interior Minister Talaat Pasha, stating: &quot;Our people will never forget these massacres.&quot; As the massacres continued unabated, Morgenthau and several other Americans decided to form a public fund-raising committee to assist the Armenians – the Committee on Armenian Atrocities (later renamed the Near East Relief) – raising over $100 million in aid, the equivalent of $1 billion today. Through his friendship with Adolph Ochs, publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Morgenthau also ensured that the massacres continued to receive prominent coverage. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published 145 articles in 1915 alone.

Exasperated with his relationship with the Ottoman government, he resigned from the ambassadorship in 1916. Looking back on that decision in his memoir &quot;Ambassador Morgenthau&#x27;s Story&quot;, he wrote he had come to see the Ottoman Empire as &quot;a place of horror. I had reached the end of my resources. I found intolerable my further daily association with men, however gracious and accommodating…who were still reeking with the blood of nearly a million human beings.&quot; He published his conversations with Ottoman leaders and his account of the Armenian genocide in &quot;Ambassador Morgenthau&#x27;s Story&quot;, which appeared in the end of 1918.

In June 1917 Felix Frankfurter accompanied Morgenthau, as a representative of the War Department, on a secret mission to persuade the Ottoman Empire to abandon the Central Powers in the war effort. The mission had as its stated purpose to &quot;ameliorate the condition of the Jewish communities in Palestine&quot;. In 1918 Morgenthau gave public speeches in the United States warning that the Greeks and Assyrians were being subjected to the &quot;same methods&quot; of deportation and &quot;wholesale massacre&quot; as the Armenians, and that two million Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians had already perished.

===Interwar period===
Following the war, there was much interest and preparation within the Jewish community for the forthcoming Paris Peace Conference, by groups both supportive and opposed to the concept of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In March 1919, as President Woodrow Wilson was leaving for the Conference, Morgenthau was among 31 prominent Jewish Americans to sign an anti-Zionist petition presented by U.S. Congressman Julius Kahn; he and many other prominent Jewish representatives attended the Conference. Morgenthau served as an advisor regarding Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and later worked with war-related charitable bodies, including the Relief Committee for the Middle East, the Greek Refugee Settlement Commission and the American Red Cross. In 1919, he headed the United States government fact-finding mission to Poland, which produced the Morgenthau Report. In 1933, he was the American representative at the Geneva Conference.

==Death==

Morgenthau died in 1946 following a cerebral hemorrhage, in New York City, and was buried in Hawthorne, New York, at the age of 90. His son Henry Morgenthau Jr. was a Secretary of the Treasury from 1934 to July 1945. His daughter, Alma Wertheim, had married banker Maurice Wertheim in 1909 and was the mother of historian Barbara Tuchman. His daughter Ruth Morgenthau was married to banker George W. Naumburg (son of Elkan Naumburg), and then John Knight.

<doc id="1276663" wikidata="Q660309" url="?curid=1276663" title="Sara Lee Corporation">
<text>The Sara Lee Corporation was an American consumer-goods company based in Downers Grove, Illinois. The Sara Lee name was used of a number of frozen and packaged foods, often known for the long-running slogan &quot;Everybody doesn&#x27;t like something, but nobody doesn&#x27;t like Sara Lee&quot;.

In 2005, Sara Lee Corporation had operations in more than 40 countries; sold food, beverage, and household products in over 180 countries; and had some 137,000 employees worldwide. On July 4, 2012, Sara Lee Corporation was split into two companies: one for North American operations renamed Hillshire Brands, which continued to use the Sara Lee name on bakery and certain deli products, and the other for international beverage and bakery businesses that was named D.E Master Blenders 1753. Hillshire Brands was acquired by Tyson Foods in 2014.

In 2018, Tyson Foods sold the Sara Lee brand and product line to private investment firm Kohlberg &amp; Company.

==History==
In 1935, Charles Lubin and his brother-in-law, Arthur Gordon, bought a small chain of Chicago neighborhood bakeries called Community Bake Shops. Working together, the businessmen expanded their original three stores into a chain of seven bakeries. Lubin wanted to expand the business. He named a cream cheesecake after his eight-year-old daughter, Sara Lee Lubin, and changed the name of the business to &quot;Kitchens of Sara Lee&quot;.

In 1956, the Consolidated Foods Corporation bought Kitchens of Sara Lee, and it became one of the company&#x27;s best-known brand names. In 1985, the name Sara Lee Corporation was adopted for the corporation as a whole. While the company traced its lineage to 1939, when Nathan Cummings acquired C. D. Kenny Company, a wholesale distributor of sugar, coffee, and tea in Baltimore, Consolidated Foods Corporation was actually the descendant of a Chicago grocery store called Sprague, Warner &amp; Company. This enterprise, which started on State Street in Chicago, was founded during the Civil War by Albert A. Sprague and Ezra J. Warner. By 1909, Sprague, Warner &amp; Company was one of the leading wholesale grocery companies in the United States, famous for house brands such as Richelieu, Ferndell, and Batavia. In 1942, this company was acquired by the Canadian-born Cummings. The new Chicago-based company, at first called Sprague Warner–Kenny Corp., ranked as the largest grocery wholesaler in the United States. Annual sales grew from about $20 million in 1942 to $120 million by 1946. After changing its name in 1945 to Consolidated Grocers, Cummings&#x27;s company became the Consolidated Foods Corporation in 1953.

In 1986, Sara Lee bought the manufacturing and mail order operations of Wolferman&#x27;s, a maker of English muffins, that dated back to 1888.

In February 1988, Sara Lee agreed to the purchase of the 84-year-old Adams-Millis Corporation of High Point, North Carolina, the largest private label sock and stocking manufacturer in the United States, with 3000 employees and 1987 sales of nearly $200 million.

On June 25, 2001, Sara Lee Corp pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and agreed to pay $4.4 million for selling tainted meat that was blamed for at least 15 deaths and six miscarriages in 1998; the agreement stressed that Sara Lee&#x27;s Bil Mar Foods division did not knowingly distribute the tainted meat. On August 7, 2001, Sara Lee Corp cleared the last remaining regulatory hurdle in its purchase of Earthgrains Co, receiving approval from the European Commission (S).

Brenda C. Barnes joined Sara Lee Corporation in July 2004 as the president and chief operating officer. Then in February 2005, Barnes was named president and chief executive officer, and the corporation announced it would move its headquarters from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Downers Grove, Illinois, which housed the company&#x27;s North American operating businesses and the majority of Sara Lee&#x27;s corporate staff.

Also in February 2005, the company began executing a multi-year plan to transform Sara Lee into a company focused on its food, beverage, and household and body care businesses around the world. To support that focus, Sara Lee announced plans to dispose of approximately 40 percent of the company&#x27;s revenues, including its apparel, European packaged meats, US retail coffee and direct selling businesses. On December 22, 2005, Sara Lee Corporation was to delist from Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris stock exchanges, as well as the Swiss Exchange. The company said it was taking the voluntary step due to low trading volumes on those exchanges.

2005 also saw the debut of Sara Lee Soft &amp; Smooth made with whole grain white bread. In October, Barnes succeeded C. Steven McMillan as chairman. The year ended with the sale of the direct selling business to Tupperware.

In 2006, Sara Lee announced a new company wide campaign: &quot;the joy of eating&quot;. The campaign was part of a restructuring at Sara Lee.

2006 featured the divestiture of Sara Lee&#x27;s European meats and European branded apparel businesses. In addition, the corporation spun off to its shareholders the branded apparel, Americas/Asia, business, into a separate, publicly traded company called Hanesbrands Inc.

Including the spin-off, Sara Lee raised more than $3.7 billion in proceeds as part of the company&#x27;s transformation plan. In addition to the monetary benefits, the company became tightly focused on its core businesses: food, beverage, and household and body care. In 2008, Sara Lee sold off its Direct Store Delivery foodservice coffee business to Farmer Brothers for a reported $45 million.

By 2009, Sara Lee was pursuing the sale of its household and body care business in their continuing effort to focus on core business. In April, Sara Lee launched a state-of-the-art research and development center named The Kitchens of Sara Lee, a campus at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Downers Grove.

On September 25, 2009, Sara Lee announced it accepted a binding offer by Unilever for €1.275 billion to sell its global body care and European detergents business. The transaction was approved by EU regulators in November of the following year.

On November 9, 2010, Sara Lee said that by selling its North American Fresh Bakery unit to Grupo Bimbo, it could grow in other areas. The $959 million deal gave Sara Lee the right to continue using the Sara Lee name on frozen desserts and meat products. Grupo Bimbo was to use the Sara Lee name for fresh-baked products around the world except for Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The deal also gave Grupo Bimbo 41 baking plants, and the regional brands Grandma Sycamore&#x27;s, Heiner&#x27;s and Rainbo.

On January 28, 2011, Sara Lee announced the company would be split into two units. The company said its North American operations (including Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and Hillshire Farm) would take the Hillshire Brands corporate name, while the international beverage and bakery businesses (including Douwe Egberts, Senseo, Pickwick, Maison du Café, L&#x27;OR, Café Pilão, and Marcilla) would constitute a separate unit named D.E Master Blenders 1753. Some analysts claimed splitting the business into two units would make a takeover more likely. Stockholders would have equal shares in both companies. In the same month, Sara Lee received noted media attention regarding their strategy to &quot;refocus on the core&quot; to revamp the company. In a Forbes magazine column, Adam Hartung stated Sara Lee could not &quot;cost-cut, refocus or re-align a business to success with no new products and no growth plan&quot;. Also, Marcel Smits, interim CEO since Barnes suffered a stroke, became the new CEO, and Jan Bennink director and chairman. The split was completed on July 4, 2012.

The successor company, Hillshire Brands, re-located its headquarters from Downers Grove to Chicago in 2012. In 2014, Hillshire, along with the Sara Lee operations, was acquired by Tyson Foods.

On June 1, 2018, Tyson announced that it would sell the Sara Lee, Van&#x27;s, Chef Pierre and Bistro Collection brands to Kohlberg &amp; Company. The sale was completed on August 1, forming Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, which will be based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois.

===Discontinued===
On November 19, 2008, Sara Lee Corporation, which had acquired &quot;the No. 2 kosher hot dog brand&quot; in 1993, announced that it would close its kosher hot dog and meat processing facility in Chicago, on or before January 30, 2009. Sara Lee decided to exit the kosher meat business and discontinue processing and distributing products made under all of its kosher meat brands, including: Best&#x27;s Kosher, Sinai Kosher, Shofar and Wilno.

As of early 2019, certain Sara Lee bread and other baked goods products, which had dropped some kosher certifications in 2017, restored them.

<doc id="1276669" wikidata="Q5034935" url="?curid=1276669" title="Cape May Seashore Lines">
<text>Cape May Seashore Lines is a short line railroad in southern New Jersey that operates both freight trains and excursion trains. It offers two excursion services: a round trip between Richland and Tuckahoe along the Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary railroad line and a round trip between Rio Grande, Cold Spring Village, and Cape May City along the Cape May Branch (service between Rio Grande and Cape May is suspended due to theft of track material and damage along the Cape May Branch). The track is owned by NJ Transit and leased to the Seashore Lines. The Cape May Branch is the original line operated by the Cape May Seashore Lines and runs from Cape May north to Tuckahoe, connecting to the Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary in Tuckahoe. Cape May Seashore Lines operates freight service along the Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary line between Winslow and Palermo, interchanging with Conrail Shared Assets Operations in Winslow. Tony Macrie has been president of the Seashore Lines since he formed the railroad in 1984.

==History==
The Cape May rail line was constructed in 1863 by the Tuckahoe &amp; Cape May Railroad and was operated by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway&#x27;s Atlantic City Railroad, later becoming part of the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL). Known as &quot;The Steel Speedway to the Shore,&quot; it eventually became part of Conrail&#x27;s (CR), which ceased passenger service in 1981 and freight service on October 10, 1983. The line was subsequently sold to New Jersey Transit as their Cape May Branch.

Cape May Seashore Lines (CMSL) was established by CEO Tony Macrie in January 1984. Regular train service between Cape May Court House and Cold Spring Village began in 1996 and extended to Cape May City in 1999 following the repair of the swing bridge over the Cape May Canal. In 2005, mechanical issues with the swing bridge halted trains from entering Cape May City. Although the bridge was repaired in 2006, an April 2007 storm damaged the tracks, leaving locomotives stranded in Tuckahoe. Passenger service between Rio Grande and Cape May City resumed on October 12, 2009. In 2020, CMSL partnered with railbiking company Revolution Rail offering excursions over approximately two miles of trackage between Cape May Station and the swing bridge over Cape May Canal.

CMSL currently operates excursion trains on 15 miles of the former Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary between Tuckahoe and Richland. The current passenger train operations include themed services such as the Valentine’s Express, Easter Bunny Express, and Santa Express. Trainsets primarily consist of the railroad&#x27;s two GP38 diesel locomotives and several passenger cars. CMSL also offers excursions for community and corporate events. 

In November 2021, CMSL filed with the Surface Transportation Board to operate freight rail service on the Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary Track between Winslow and Palermo, approximately 30 miles long. Service commenced in February 2022. 

===2012 Vandalism===
On March 1, 2012, CMSL was informed by the New Jersey State Police of track material theft on their Cape May Branch in Dennisville. This main line connects Tuckahoe to Cape May City. Several individuals involved in the theft were arrested and charged. On March 5, a father and son from the Villas area of Lower Township, New Jersey, along with an individual from Rio Grande, were apprehended.

A subsequent inspection by Macrie and CMSL employees revealed the theft encompassed approximately 6,800 feet (1 1/4 miles) of track, affecting 75 percent of the tie plates and spikes in that section and damaging numerous cross ties. Due to the vandalism, excursion trains did not operate in summer 2012. However, CMSL offered rides on railroad speeder vehicles along undamaged tracks of the Cape May Branch. As of 2024, Rio Grande–Cape May service remains suspended.

=== 2024 Track Rehabilitation Project ===
In early 2024, CMSL released a statement that it was beginning a track rehabilitation project on the former Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary Track between Winslow and Richland. According to the release, over 5,000 new crossties were installed between Winslow and Richland. The project also allowed for the complete rehabilitation of the one-mile long Milmay Passing Siding. Additional rehabilitation work was completed in the Tuckahoe Yard Area.

===New Jersey Seashore Lines===
New Jersey Seashore Lines (NJSL) is a subsidiary of CMSL, established in collaboration with Clayton Sand Company in Chatsworth, New Jersey. Utilizing state and federal grants, NJSL rehabilitated a 13-mile section of track between Lakehurst and Woodmansie in Woodland Township, where Clayton operates a sand mine. The line was initially intended to transport sand and gravel and serve other customers along the route. Originally owned by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the line was part of the historic &quot;Blue Comet&quot; route. South of Woodmansie, the tracks are dormant, with no connection to the south. Neither CMSL, NJSL, nor Clayton Sand Company have provided information regarding current or future plans for the line or its operational status.

<text>The Patrick White Award is an annual literary prize established by Patrick White. White used his 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature award to establish a trust for this prize.

The $25,000 cash award is given to a writer who has been highly creative over a long period but has not necessarily received adequate recognition. White stipulated that the award be announced the Friday after the Melbourne Cup to turn attention from sport to literature. The 2010 award was reduced to $18,000 because of the economic slump, and in 2012 it was $23,000. In 2020 the winner received $15,000. Writers are automatically eligible without the necessity for submissions.

<text>GT3 (Gas Turbine 3) was a prototype mainline gas turbine locomotive built in 1961 by English Electric at its Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to investigate the use of its gas turbines in rail traction applications. It followed 18000 and 18100 as gas turbines 1 and 2. It was designed by English Electric engineer J. O. P. Hughes in a project that started in the early 1950s. Externally it resembled a steam tender locomotive, but the tender carried kerosene fuel. The designer said the traditional chassis and mechanical transmission avoided complications with (at the time of its conception) relatively untried technologies for bogies and electrical transmission.

==Overview==
The National Railway Museum Archives hold the JOP Hughes papers which contain initial concept sketches for various 4-8-4 wheel arrangement single-unit configurations of the machine and early 4-6-0 tender locomotive drawings. These early concept drawings show various names, numbers and liveries, and were drawn with Boxpok-type wheels. The final design was for a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement locomotive with a fuel tender, looking much like a traditional steam locomotive in form.

As constructed the locomotive was built with bespoke heavy steel frames which not only bore the auxiliaries, combustion chamber, turbines, heat exchanger and locomotive cab, but also provided adhesive weight for the finished machine. The frames were carried by a leading two-axle outside-framed bogie and three main axles. The driving wheels were of conventional design in the finished locomotive and were of diameter with 19 spokes and conventional balance weights. The centre axle mounted a mechanical transmission shaft driven from the turbine assembly, with power to the outer axles being transmitted by side rods. Power came from an English Electric EM27L gas turbine arrangement of with high- and low-pressure turbines. The low-pressure turbine ran continuously in operation and was used to drive the locomotive&#x27;s auxiliaries, with the high-pressure turbine operating as higher power outputs were required. Both the locomotive and its fuel tender were vacuum-braked, with vacuum brake ejectors being driven by air pressure bled from the turbine. The locomotive&#x27;s other auxiliaries (housed in its leading end beneath the large side air intakes) were shaft- and belt-driven. 

The tender was permanently coupled behind the locomotive and contained a Spanner train heating boiler at the leading end and fuel tanks either side of a central corridor with a boiler water tank beneath. A crew toilet compartment and British Standard corridor connection were located at the rear. The six-wheel chassis was based on then standard British Railways practice, albeit it with specially made and shaped side frames and bespoke tank and bodywork assembled at Vulcan Foundry. The locomotive had a designed maximum speed of , weighed , and was painted in a lined Beech Leaf Brown Livery, earning it the nickname &quot;The Chocolate Zephyr&quot; by railway enthusiasts. Underframes, grilles and the front access and cab doors were painted Brunswick Green with lettering and lining in Orange.

== Testing ==

The locomotive was taken to British Railways&#x27; Rugby test centre in an incomplete state for testing on rollers, and then on a short section of specially laid track. After returning to Vulcan Foundry for final assembly, the locomotive was then based at the former locomotive shed at Whitchurch in Shropshire for initial light testing and crew training on the Malpas line between Crewe and Chester, before commencing loaded test runs to Llandudno Junction. One of these runs was filmed from on board the locomotive by British Movietone News and the resulting film also showed the locomotive being turned on Llandudno Junction turntable. In the event not all of the planned North Wales Coast Line test runs were completed.

GT3 then moved to Leicester Shed on the Great Central Main Line line for testing and crew training between Leicester and Woodford Halse and then Leicester and Marylebone. Leicester was convenient for English Electric&#x27;s Whetstone turbine works. During this period it was displayed at Marylebone for the 50th anniversary of the Institute of Locomotive Engineers. The event ran from 11 to 14 May 1961 and GT3 was filmed by British Pathé being inspected by the Duke of Edinburgh. Later testing was undertaken on the West Coast Main Line from Crewe over Shap Summit to Carlisle. On one of these runs Oswald Nock travelled on board and was able to both witness the locomotive in operation and record its performance, his log of the trip later appearing in &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot;″s practice and performance feature for February 1962. Commenting on the testing the designer noted that, despite some of the expected teething troubles and modifications, once it had departed on a test run GT3 had never failed to complete its booked workings. The locomotive was described as being comfortable and easy to handle for the crew, with conversation at normal volumes possible in the fully enclosed cab.

== Demise ==

Despite returning favourable performances on longer runs requiring sustained power outputs, the prototype nature of the locomotive would have required further investigation and development into a configuration which would have matched the convenience of the new double-ended diesel-electric locomotives then being built. Neither English Electric or British Railways were prepared to fund this work as they were committed to diesel-electric locomotives.They were rapidly becoming the future of rail traction with ever-improving power-to-weight ratios.

Upon completion of the Shap test runs GT3 was returned to English Electric at Vulcan Foundry at the end of 1962 and stored. Following internal correspondence in September 1965 the locomotive was partially dismantled and its turbine and heat exchanger equipment removed. It was finally scrapped at Thos. W. Ward, Salford in February 1966 having been towed there by a Standard class steam locomotive.

== Surviving Records ==

The most complete record of the locomotive is contained in the paper written by its designer in 1962 and in his papers now held at the National Railway Museum Archives in York. Much of what had been written about the locomotive was based on conjecture until these sources became available; subsequently an article in &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; for December 2015 brought together an accurate and verifiable record of the locomotive. No detailed engineering drawings of the locomotives as built are thought to have survived, the York archive containing an internal memo instructing that these were to be returned to the Gas Turbine division of English Electric when dismantling commenced in 1965. Several articles with drawings have appeared in the railway modelling press since the locomotive was scrapped, but most appear to be based on a contemporary sectional view widely published at the time and are flawed with regard to details such as driving wheels (19-spoke), roof and side access hatches, cab rear, tender front and tender rear. The most accurate drawing appears to have been a contemporary &quot;Skinley&quot; drawing produced with the assistance of JOP Hughes. A copy resides with correspondence between Hughes and Skinley in the JOP Hughes papers at the National Railway Museum. In recent years a 5-inch (127 mm) gauge turbine powered model of the locomotive has been built and exhibited in the UK.

== Models ==
Canadian-based Model Railway manufacturer KR Models announced that would be creating a OO Scale model of the GT3 in its prototype brown livery in 2018, and the model was delivered in 2020.

<text>Patrick Anthony Jennings (born 12 June 1945) is a Northern Irish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is widely recognised as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the sport.

He played 119 international matches for Northern Ireland in an international career which lasted for over 22 years. During his career, Jennings played for Newry Town, Watford and in the top division with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, winning the FA Cup with both of the north London rivals. In total, Jennings made over 1,000 top level appearances, and despite being a goalkeeper, he scored from play in the 1967 FA Charity Shield.

== Club career ==
=== Newry Town &amp; Watford ===
After playing for a local under-18 side in Newry at the age of 11 (named Shamrock Rovers, not to be confused with the Dublin club of the same name), Jennings concentrated on Gaelic football until he was sixteen years old, when he made his football comeback with his hometown side Newry Town. After impressing with the team he moved to English Third Division side Watford in May 1963. Jennings again impressed in his first season in England, playing every league game for his club, and making two international appearances that season. He was signed by Tottenham Hotspur for £27,000 in June 1964.

=== Tottenham Hotspur ===
Jennings spent thirteen years at White Hart Lane, where he played in 472 league games for Spurs, and 591 in all competitions. He won the FA Cup in 1967, the League Cup in 1971 and 1973, and the UEFA Cup in 1972. He also scored once, in the 1967 Charity Shield, from his own area, kicking the ball from his hands and sending a large punt down the field that bounced over Manchester United goalkeeper Alex Stepney and into the net. In 1973 the Football Writers&#x27; Association named him as its footballer of the year. Three years later he won PFA&#x27;s version of the award – he was the first goalkeeper to receive this accolade, and to this date remains only one of two, along with Peter Shilton.

=== Arsenal ===
On 6 August 1977, he was transferred to Tottenham&#x27;s arch-rivals, Arsenal, with Tottenham thinking he was nearing the end of his career. However, Jennings saw off rivals for the goalkeeper&#x27;s jersey to play for Arsenal for another eight years. Whilst at Highbury, he helped Arsenal to four Cup finals in three successive years; the FA Cup final in 1978, 1979, and 1980, as well as the European Cup Winners Cup final that year. However, Arsenal only managed to win the second of these finals, a 3–2 victory against Manchester United. In total, Jennings made 327 appearances for Arsenal, 237 of them in the League, between 1977 and his eventual retirement from first-team club football in 1985. On 26 February 1983, he became the first player in English football to make 1,000 senior appearances, celebrating this milestone with a clean sheet in a goalless league draw for Arsenal at West Bromwich Albion. Jennings played his last game in the league for Arsenal against Sheffield Wednesday 25 November 1984 , and he was finally replaced by John Lukic as the first choice keeper. A farewell match for Jennings was played against Tottenham Hotspur 8 May 1985 at Highbury.

=== Later career ===
After his retirement, Jennings returned to Tottenham Hotspur, playing mostly in their reserve side to maintain his match sharpness for Northern Ireland&#x27;s 1986 World Cup campaign. His final appearance for Tottenham was in the Football League Super Cup against Liverpool in January 1986. He was also briefly on Everton&#x27;s books, having been signed as goalkeeping cover for the 1986 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, Neville Southall having been injured playing for Wales.

== International career ==

Jennings made his Northern Ireland debut as an eighteen-year-old, whilst playing for Watford. This game, on 15 April 1964, was a British Home Championship match against Wales, Northern Ireland won the game 3–2; George Best made his international debut in the same game. He made four appearances in Northern Ireland’s best-ever performance at the 1982 World Cup, conceding only one goal in the three first group stage games — including a 1-0
win with 10 men against hosts Spain — before letting four past him against eventual group D winners France in the second group stage games.

Despite retiring from club football in 1985, Jennings played his final international game at the 1986 World Cup, on his 41st birthday, making him the World Cup&#x27;s oldest-ever participant until Roger Milla broke his record at 42 in 1994, who in turn had his record broken by Faryd Mondragón at 43 years in 2014, who in turn had his record broken by Essam El Hadary at 45 years in 2018. The match was Northern Ireland&#x27;s final group game, a 3–0 defeat against Brazil. In total, Jennings participated in the qualifying stages of six World Cups between 1966 and 1986.

== Retirement ==
Following his retirement Jennings has worked as a goalkeeping coach. He has worked at Tottenham in this capacity since 1993. In 2003 Jennings was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of the skills he demonstrated in the English league. His son, also named Pat, is also a goalkeeper, having played for League of Ireland clubs University College Dublin, Derry City, Shamrock Rovers and NIFL Premiership club Glenavon.

Jennings and his family have lived for many years in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where his son attended The Broxbourne School along with the sons of fellow Spurs players Chris Hughton, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ray Clemence. He is still associated with Spurs and hosts Corporate Hospitality fans in the Pat Jennings Lounges at White Hart Lane and Windsor Park, Belfast.

== Personal life ==
Jennings married Eleanor Toner, a singer from Newry, in 1967. They have four children: Mairead, Siobhan, Ciara and Patrick Junior, a goalkeeper. Jennings is Catholic.

== Honours ==
Jennings was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to association football in the 1976 Birthday Honours; he was promoted to Officer of the same Order (OBE) in the 1987 New Year Honours for services to football, particularly in Northern Ireland, and promoted further to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to association football and charity.
On 8 November 2023, Jennings unveiled a statue in his honour in Kildare Street, Newry.

<doc id="1276677" wikidata="Q410330" url="?curid=1276677" title="Aitaroun">
<text>Aitaroun (or Aytaroun; ) is a municipality in southern Lebanon. It is on the northern border of Israel, and 125 km from Beirut. The majority of its population are Shiite Muslims.

== Etymology ==
The village&#x27;s name origin is &quot;Itruma&quot;, which means; &quot;The Beautiful Smell&quot;.

== History ==
=== Ottoman era ===
In 1596, it was named as a village, &quot;’Aytarun&quot; in the Ottoman &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (district) of Safed, with a population of 91 households and 15 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, goats, and beehives, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues” and a fixed sum; a total of 14,570 akçe.

Visiting in 1875, Victor Guérin described it as a village with 200 Metualis.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described it: &quot;A large village, built of stone, containing 400 Moslems, situated in bed of wady, with olives, gardens and arable land. Water from a large birket and cisterns.&quot;

===Israeli occupation===
In 1982 the Israeli invasion of Lebanon began. Until 2000, the Israeli army occupied southern Lebanon.

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israel attacked Aitaroun several times. On July 16, 12 civilians from the Akhrass family, including 7 Canadian nationals, were killed when their Aitaroun home were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes. On July 18, 9 civilians from the Awada family were killed after Israeli air-strikes against their homes. Surviving family members reported that Hezbollah fighters had been launching rockets from a location within the village, approximately 100 to 150 meters from their house. In general, however, Hezbollah did not place military facilities in built up areas, and instead located its bunkers in fields and valleys away from villages. 

On July 19, Israel killed 6 and wounded 8 civilians as they were trying to leave Aitaroun. The IDF had considered such movement suspicious, as it claimed that &quot;all Lebanese civilians had observed its warnings to evacuate villages south of the Litani river&quot; and thus there was &quot;no need to discriminate between military objectives and civilians&quot;.

After the war, Israeli deputy ambassador to the UN, Daniel Carmon, justified attacks on civilians by stating &quot;there is hardly any distinction between Hezbollah and the civilian population [in southern Lebanon]. This whole region was a region in which you could not make a distinction between the one and the other&quot;.

The village lost 41 villagers to the war new figures said. Families laid flowers and read Quranic verses at the graves on October 23, 2006, which marks the Eid ul-Fitr-holiday.

=== 2023–2024 conflict ===
During the 2023-2024 Israel Hezbollah conflict, Israel frequently attacked Shia-majority towns like Aitaroun via airstrikes and artillery barrages, reducing many of its communities to rubble. In December 2023, the Israeli army attacked a residential neighborhood, injuring 4 people and causing significant damage to buildings.

==Demographics==
In 2014 Muslims made up 99.57% of registered voters in Aitaroun. 98.72% of the voters were Shiite Muslims.

Aitaroun had a total population estimated at 20,000 in 2002. However, the actual number of residents is now considered to be significantly higher. The non-resident population is divided between emigrants and internal migrants distributed throughout Lebanon. Approximately 45% of the population is under the age of 30 and the average family size is 6-7 members.

== Economy ==
Most families depend on agriculture as their primary source of income. During 1978 to 2000, the village received a significant cash flow from enlistment in the Israeli funded South Lebanon Army and through work in Israel.

== Housing and infrastructure ==
There are around 1,300 homes in the village. An electrical network was established in 1964 and access to telecommunications is fully restored since 2006. In 2005 a telephone exchange was installed in the village offering connectivity to Lebanon&#x27;s telephone network. Mobile communications and internet connectivity were also fully restored.

During the occupation, potable water in the village was provided by water wells drilled in the village by Israel. The main water source is the collection of rain water which is stored in both private and public reservoirs.

== Government and social services ==
There are five schools operating in Aitaroun: two public and three private. Public schools, elementary
and intermediate, encompass 250 students, with a higher percentage of girls especially for the
intermediate level. The total number of students in the private schools amount to 570 distributed among one elementary school and two intermediate schools. The village has one health center operated by the Ministry of Social Affairs. The municipal council in the village was established in 1961.

== Flora ==
The area is rich in wild herbs, flowers and mushrooms. Particularly prevalent are the red poppy flower, wild capers and thistles. Other flora that are believed to be more agricultural or introduced, include; grape vines, pomegranate trees, figs, cactus apple, sumac, various wild berries.

<text>Ruth Elfriede Hildner (1 November 1919 – 2 May 1947) was a guard at several Nazi concentration camps during World War II.

Hildner was conscripted into camp service in July 1944, arriving at Ravensbrück concentration camp to be trained as a camp matron. Hildner, 24 years old, entered the Dachau concentration camp in September 1944 as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot;. Next she was sent to an Agfa Camera Werke-connected subcamp at Munich; she eventually served in several subcamps, including Hennigsdorf, Wittenberg and Haselhorst. In December 1944, she arrived at Helmbrechts, a tiny subcamp of Flossenbürg located near Hof, Germany. There, she was feared by the camp&#x27;s inmates, both Jews and non-Jews.

In April 1945, the guards at the small camp evacuated the women in the face of the U.S. Army. Hildner was one of several guards on the death march who took part in mistreatment and murder of several young girls with her baton. She also accompanied the march into Zwodau, another subcamp of Flossenbürg, located in Czechoslovakia. Several days later, the march departed for western Czechoslovakia. In early May 1945, the SS men and female overseers fled the march site. Hildner melted into the hordes of refugees, escaping temporarily, but was recognized by Czechoslovakian police in March 1947, arrested, and put in prison. 

==Trial and execution==

On 2 May 1947, aged 27, she was tried in the Extraordinary People&#x27;s Court in Písek, Czechoslovakia, found guilty of war crimes and hanged the same day.
