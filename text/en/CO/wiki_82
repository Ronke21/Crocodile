<text>Michael Reid (19 January 1940 – 29 July 2007) was an English comedian, actor, author and occasional television presenter. He played the role of Frank Butcher in the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and hosted the children&#x27;s game show &quot;Runaround&quot;. He was known for his gravelly voice and strong London accent.

==Early life==
Michael Reid was born at Salvation Mothers Hospital, Hackney in 1940, the son of Ellen Louvian ( Ives) and Sidney Reid. The Blitz caused his family to move to Tottenham where he attended Rowland Hill School.

==Career==
Reid&#x27;s first work in entertainment was as a stand-up comedian in clubs and aboard cruise liners in the early 1960s. He then became an extra playing uncredited roles in television series such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (in &quot;The Myth Makers&quot; and &quot;The War Machines&quot;), &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;Department S&quot;. He was fired from working as Roger Moore&#x27;s underwater stunt double in &quot;The Saint&quot; after drawing attention to Moore&#x27;s thinning hair. He also worked as a stuntman for films such as &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967).

He then became one of the original stars of &quot;The Comedians&quot;, a popular TV series of the 1970s produced by Johnnie Hamp for the Manchester-based Granada Television, which consisted entirely of short slots by mature comedians. Being the only obviously London comic in a line-up made up predominately of Northern English and Northern Irish comedians, Reid stood out. As a comedian, Reid&#x27;s well-known catchphrases included &#x27;Terrific&#x27; (pronounced with the emphasis on each syllable), &#x27;Turn It In&#x27; and &#x27;Move Yer Arris&#x27;.

He capitalised on his initial success with a one-off hit record, a novelty version of &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; recorded for Pye. In 1975, it reached number 10 in the UK singles chart. In 1975, he also became the host of the ITV children&#x27;s TV quiz show &quot;Runaround&quot;. &quot;Runaround&quot; ended in 1981.

In 1987, he joined the cast of popular BBC television soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Frank Butcher, for which he gained much popularity over the years. He initially joined the series as a semi-regular character, first appearing in September of that year, but was so popular that during 1988 he became a full-time cast member as his character became landlord of the Queen Vic pub, buying it from Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) during 1988. The part of Butcher earned Reid the public persona of being pessimistic, which he enjoyed acting against, such as in television adverts for the soft drink Oasis. His character was involved in many popular storylines over the years; perhaps the most famous of these storylines was his character&#x27;s long turbulent relationship with Pat Wicks (played by Pam St. Clement), and later his short-lived marriage to Peggy Mitchell (played by Barbara Windsor).

In April 1994, by which time the character of Frank Butcher was one of the most popular on British television, Reid took a long break from the show, due to stress from acting out a depression storyline for the show. Later that year, he starred alongside other fellow &quot;EastEnders&quot; actors Barbara Windsor and John Altman in his classic adult pantomime &quot;Pussy in Boots&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.

His return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; was aired on Christmas Day 1995. Frank was initially reintroduced as a recurring character and after several brief stints on the show, he returned as a full-time character in May 1998. His character was part of many big storylines over the next two years. At the beginning of 2000, it was reported that Reid was suffering from heart problems, and he took time out from the show after becoming ill on the set. In May 2000, he announced that he would be leaving the soap for good due to exhaustion from the long filming schedules. He was persuaded to stay on the show for a further five months to give his character a dramatic exit. His departure was aired on 2 November 2000 when he famously departed after his affair with ex-wife Pat Evans was discovered by his current wife Peggy Mitchell. That year, he appeared in the popular British gangster film &quot;Snatch&quot; playing crooked diamond trader Doug &quot;The Head&quot; Denovitz. He went on to appear in several low-budget British films over the next few years such as &quot;Hey Mr DJ&quot; (2005) and &quot;Moussakka and Chips&quot; (2005), as well as a Spanish film titled &quot;Oh Marbella&quot; (2003).

Reid made brief returns to &quot;EastEnders&quot; in late January 2002 to appear in three episodes filmed in Spain, followed by a spin-off special episode titled &quot;Perfectly Frank&quot; in September 2003 and made his final comeback for a few episodes in December 2005. That month, Reid appeared on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; and made it clear that he had no interest in any possible future re-appearances in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The following year, he rejected another offer to return to the series.

Reid was semi-retired from show business by this time, and lived in a villa in Spain. He returned to acting in early 2007, appearing in two episodes of the long-running ITV police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot;, in which he played the part of corrupt businessman Brian Stevens. This was his last broadcast television appearance at that time, though he had filmed a reality series for ITV entitled &quot;The Baron&quot; before his death; the network was undecided as to whether it would be aired, but the programme started airing on 24 April 2008 on ITV1. Reid was the eventual winner, facing off against Suzanne Shaw after the departure of the other contestant, Malcolm McLaren. Reid was thus bestowed with the title of Baron of Troup, a genuine and hereditary barony, though one conveying no privilege aside from the use of the title itself. Reid had also completed filming as a gangster in the independent British film &quot;Jack Says&quot; four days before his death. The film was released on DVD on 22 September 2008. His character, The Guv&#x27;nor, also features in the graphic novel prequel &quot;Jack Said&quot;.

===Stand-up routines===

Throughout his career, Reid performed at many venues, but only a few shows were recorded for release on VHS and/or DVD. These titles are:

* &quot;Mike Reid Live &amp; Uncensored&quot; (only available on VHS) (1992)
* &quot;Mike Reid Live &amp; Uncensored 2&quot; (only available on VHS) (1994)
* &quot;Live at the London Palladium&quot; (available on VHS &amp; DVD) (1997)
* &quot;Some of That&quot; (only available on VHS) (1997)
* &quot;Pussy in Boots – An Uncensored Live Adult Show&quot; (with Barbara Windsor) (only available on VHS) (1998)
* &quot;Alive &amp; Kidding&quot; (only available on VHS) (1998)
* &quot;Seriously Funny&quot; (available on VHS &amp; DVD) (2000)
* &quot;Live at the Queen Vic&quot; (only available on VHS) (2002)
* &quot;Being Frank – The Guvnor&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; (available on VHS and DVD) (2008)

Reid recorded many cover versions of classic songs. In 2006, his version of Adriano Celentano&#x27;s nonsense song &quot;Prisencolinensinainciusol&quot; enjoyed a renaissance, spurred by a campaign group on social-networking website Facebook in 2010.

== Personal life ==

In 1971, he married his longtime live-in partner Shirley (née Allder); they had two sons, Mark and Michael.

In March 1990, Reid suffered tragedy when his son Mark was a victim of suicide by dousing himself with barbecue fuel and burning himself to death after years of suffering with mental health problems; he had previously shot dead his best friend at Reid&#x27;s house. Just four months after Mark&#x27;s death, Mark&#x27;s daughter died from cot death. Reid coped by ploughing himself into work, but he said years later &quot;People must see me on the TV or in cabaret laughing, singing, cracking gags and imagine that time has healed the pain and the scars. If only they knew. My son is locked away (inside) – not forgotten, just hidden away in what part we keep our private grief. Otherwise I couldn&#x27;t function.&quot;

Reid was known to be opposed to plans to introduce blasphemy laws, for the effect this would have on satire, comedy and free speech.

During the 1970s, Reid was president of Chelmsford City.

==Death==

Reid died in Marbella, Spain, on 29 July 2007, aged 67. A heavy smoker, he was suspected of having suffered a heart attack. Two weeks before he died, he had received a full medical examination and been given a clean bill of health. The 30 July 2007 &quot;EastEnders&quot; episode featured a dedication to him following the end credits.

Reid&#x27;s funeral was held on Tuesday 14 August 2007 at Little Easton Parish Church, Essex, and was attended by over 250 people, including his former &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-stars Pam St Clement, Sid Owen, Michael Greco, June Brown, Barbara Windsor, Sophie Lawrence, Bobby Davro and other members of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; cast. His body was cremated the following day at Chelmsford Crematorium, and his ashes were later buried in the graveyard of St Mary the Virgin Church at Little Easton, in Essex.

Reid&#x27;s family decided to allow fans to attend his funeral, and his widow Shirley also invited them to speak. Reid&#x27;s former co-stars in &quot;EastEnders&quot; were all given the day off work to attend his funeral.

==Posthumous events==
In November 2007, just over three months after Reid&#x27;s death, the BBC announced that his &quot;EastEnders&quot; character Frank Butcher would be killed off in April 2008. The week had been dubbed &quot;Frank Week&quot;. In the &quot;EastEnders&quot; episode shown on 1 April 2008, Frank&#x27;s funeral was held. Frank&#x27;s children, Ricky, Diane and Janine also made a comeback. In the episode in which Frank&#x27;s funeral took place, Reid appeared in archive clips during flashbacks in Pat Butcher&#x27;s head. He was also heard saying &quot;Take care of yourself, babe&quot; to Pat at the very end of the episode, a flashback of the words Frank had spoken taken from the end of the last-ever scene Reid performed in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, originally broadcast in December 2005.

<doc id="1301909" wikidata="Q1002253" url="?curid=1301909" title="Incorporation of the Bill of Rights">
<text>In United States constitutional law, incorporation is the doctrine by which portions of the Bill of Rights have been made applicable to the states. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, the courts held that its protections extended only to the actions of the federal government and that the Bill of Rights did not place limitations on the authority of the state and local governments. However, the post–Civil War era, beginning in 1865 with the Thirteenth Amendment, which declared the abolition of slavery, gave rise to the incorporation of other amendments, applying more rights to the states and people over time. Gradually, various portions of the Bill of Rights have been held to be applicable to state and local governments by incorporation via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of 1868.

Prior to the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and the development of the incorporation doctrine, the Supreme Court in 1833 held in &quot;Barron v. Baltimore&quot; that the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal, but not any state, governments. Even years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot; (1876) still held that the First and Second Amendment did not apply to state governments. However, beginning in the 1920s, a series of Supreme Court decisions interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to &quot;incorporate&quot; most portions of the Bill of Rights, making these portions, for the first time, enforceable against the state governments.

==History==
===Background===
The United States Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the United States Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government&#x27;s power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts enumerated in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). Although James Madison&#x27;s proposed amendments included a provision to extend the protection of some of the Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government.

In the 1833 case of &quot;Barron v. Baltimore&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Bill of Rights did not apply to state governments; such protections were instead provided by the constitutions of each state. After the Civil War, Congress and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which included the Due Process Clause and the Privileges or Immunities Clause. While the Fifth Amendment had included a due process clause, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment crucially differed from the Fifth Amendment in that it explicitly applied to the states. The Privileges or Immunities Clause also explicitly applied to the states, unlike the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. In the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; (1873), the Supreme Court ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was not designed to protect individuals from the actions of state governments. In &quot;Twining v. New Jersey&quot; (1908), the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Due Process Clause might incorporate some of the Bill of Rights, but continued to reject any incorporation under the Privileges or Immunities Clause.

===Incorporation===
The doctrine of incorporation has been law since Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886). At 116 U.S. 253 the Supreme Court opined &quot;The provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution that &quot;No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States&quot; does not prevent a state from passing such laws to regulate the privileges and immunities of its own citizens as do not abridge their privileges and immunities as citizens of the United States.&quot; The Fifth Amendment Takings Clause was specifically incorporated in &quot;Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad v. City of Chicago&quot; (1897) in which the Supreme Court appeared to require some form of just compensation for property appropriated by state or local authorities (although there was a state statute on the books that provided the same guarantee) or, more commonly, to &quot;Gitlow v. New York&quot; (1925), in which the Court expressly held that States were bound to protect freedom of speech. Since that time, the Court has steadily incorporated most of the significant provisions of the Bill of Rights. Provisions that the Supreme Court has not specifically incorporated include the Fifth Amendment right to an indictment by a grand jury, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in civil lawsuits.

Incorporation applies both procedurally and substantively to the guarantees of the states. Thus, procedurally, only a jury can convict a defendant of a serious crime, since the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right has been incorporated against the states; substantively, for example, states must recognize the First Amendment prohibition against a state-established religion, regardless of whether state laws and constitutions offer such a prohibition. The Supreme Court declined to apply new procedural constitutional rights retroactively against the states in criminal cases in &quot;Teague v. Lane&quot;, .

Rep. John Bingham, the principal framer of the Fourteenth Amendment, advocated that the Fourteenth applied the first eight Amendments of the Bill of Rights to the States. The U.S. Supreme Court subsequently declined to interpret it that way, despite the dissenting argument in the 1947 case of &quot;Adamson v. California&quot; by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black that the framers&#x27; intent should control the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment (he included a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham&#x27;s congressional testimony). Although the &quot;Adamson&quot; Court declined to adopt Black&#x27;s interpretation, the Court during the following twenty-five years employed a doctrine of selective incorporation that succeeded in extending against the States almost all of the protections in the Bill of Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights. The Bill of Rights thus imposes legal limits on the powers of governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot; (1943) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted, the idea of the Bill of Rights &quot;was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.&quot; This is why &quot;fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.&quot; The 14th Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and is cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

===Selective versus total incorporation===
In the 1940s and 1960s the Supreme Court gradually issued a series of decisions incorporating several of the specific rights from the Bill of Rights, so as to be binding upon the States. A dissenting school of thought championed by Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas supported that incorporation of specific rights, but urged incorporation of all specific rights instead of just some of them. Black was for so-called mechanical incorporation, or total incorporation, of Amendments 1 through 8 of the Bill of Rights. Black felt that the Fourteenth Amendment required the States to respect all of the enumerated rights set forth in the first eight amendments, but he did not wish to see the doctrine expanded to include other, unenumerated &quot;fundamental rights&quot; that might be based on the Ninth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment was excluded from total incorporation as well, due to it already being patently concerned with the power of the states. Black felt that his formulation eliminated any arbitrariness or caprice in deciding what the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect, by sticking to words already found in the Constitution. Although Black was willing to invalidate federal statutes on federalism grounds, he was not inclined to read any of the first eight amendments as states&#x27; rights provisions as opposed to individual rights provisions. Justice Black felt that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to apply the first eight amendments from the Bill of Rights to the states, as he expressed in his dissenting opinion in &quot;Adamson v. California&quot;. This view was again expressed by Black in his concurrence in &quot;Duncan v. Louisiana&quot; citing the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Privileges or Immunities Clause: &quot;&#x27;No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States&#x27; seem to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States.&quot;

===Due process interpretation===
Justice Felix Frankfurter, however, felt that the incorporation process ought to be incremental, and that the federal courts should only apply those sections of the Bill of Rights whose abridgment would &quot;shock the conscience,&quot; as he put it in &quot;Rochin v. California&quot; (1952). Such a selective incorporation approach followed that of Justice Moody, who wrote in &quot;Twining v. New Jersey&quot; (1908) that &quot;It is possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action may also be safeguarded against state action, because a denial of them would be a denial of due process of law. If this is so, it is not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments, but because they are of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.&quot; The due process approach thus considers a right to be incorporated not because it was listed in the Bill of Rights, but only because it is required by the definition of due process, which may change over time. For example, Moody&#x27;s decision in &quot;Twining&quot; stated that the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination was not inherent in a conception of due process and so did not apply to states, but was overruled in &quot;Malloy v. Hogan&quot; (1964). Similarly, Justice Cardozo stated in &quot;Palko v. Connecticut&quot; (1937) that the right against double jeopardy was not inherent to due process and so does not apply to the states, but that was overruled in &quot;Benton v. Maryland&quot; (1969). Frankfurter&#x27;s incrementalist approach did carry the day, but the end result is very nearly what Justice Black advocated, with the exceptions noted below.

===Incorporation under privileges or immunities===
Some have suggested that the Privileges or Immunities Clause would be a more appropriate textual basis than the due process clause for incorporation of the Bill of Rights. It is often said that the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; &quot;gutted the privileges or immunities clause&quot; and thus prevented its use for applying the Bill of Rights against the states. In his dissent to &quot;Adamson v. California&quot;, however, Justice Hugo Black pointed out that the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; did not directly involve any right enumerated in the Constitution:

Thus, in Black&#x27;s view, the &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; should not impede incorporation of the Bill of Rights against the states, via the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Some scholars go even further, and argue that the &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot; affirmatively supported incorporation of the Bill of Rights against the states. In dicta, Justice Miller&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; went so far as to acknowledge that the &quot;right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances ... are rights of the citizen guaranteed by the Federal Constitution,&quot; although in context Miller may have only been referring to assemblies for petitioning the federal government.

In the 2010 landmark case &quot;McDonald v. Chicago&quot;, the Supreme Court declared the Second Amendment is incorporated through the Due Process Clause. However, Justice Thomas, the fifth justice in the majority, criticized substantive due process and declared instead that he reached the same incorporation only through the Privileges or Immunities Clause. No other justice attempted to question his rationale. This is considered by some as a &quot;revival&quot; of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, however as it is a concurring opinion and not the majority opinion in the case, it is not binding precedent in lower courts; it is merely an indication that SCOTUS may be inclined, given the proper question, to reconsider and ultimately reverse the &quot;Slaughterhouse Cases&quot;.

In the 2019 case &quot;Timbs v. Indiana&quot;, the Supreme Court, citing &quot;McDonald,&quot; ruled that the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated through the Due Process Clause. Justice Thomas did not join this opinion; in a separate opinion concurring in the judgment, he once again declared that he would reach the same incorporation through the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Justice Gorsuch took an in-between position. He joined the opinion of the Court, but wrote a short concurrence acknowledging that the Privileges or Immunities Clause might be the better vehicle for incorporation—but ultimately deciding that nothing in the case itself turned on the question of which clause is the source of the incorporation.

==== Possible consequences of the Privileges or Immunities approach ====

In the &quot;Timbs&quot; decision, one of Justice Thomas&#x27;s stated reasons for preferring incorporation through the Privileges or Immunities Clause was what he perceived as the Court&#x27;s failure to consistently or correctly define which rights are &quot;fundamental&quot; under the Due Process Clause. In Thomas&#x27; view, incorporation through Privileges or Immunities would allow the Court to exclude rights from incorporation which had erroneously been deemed fundamental in previous decisions.

Another difference between incorporation through Due Process versus Privileges or Immunities is that the text of the Privileges or Immunities Clause refers only to the privileges or immunities of &quot;citizens,&quot; while the Due Process Clause protects the due process rights of &quot;any person.&quot; It is possible that a switch to Privileges or Immunities incorporation would limit protections of the rights of non-citizens against state governments.

== Specific amendments ==
Many of the provisions of the First Amendment were applied to the States in the 1930s and 1940s, but most of the procedural protections provided to criminal defendants were not enforced against the States until the Warren Court of the 1960s, famous for its concern for the rights of those accused of crimes, brought state standards in line with federal requirements. The following list enumerates, by amendment and individual clause, the Supreme Court cases that have incorporated the rights contained in the Bill of Rights. (The Ninth Amendment is not listed; its wording indicates that it &quot;is not a source of rights as such; it is simply a rule about how to read the Constitution.&quot; The Tenth Amendment is also not listed; by its wording, it is a reservation of powers to the states and to the people.)

=== Amendment I ===
Guarantee against establishment of religion
* This provision has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Everson v. Board of Education&quot;, .
Guarantee of free exercise of religion
* This provision has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Cantwell v. Connecticut&quot;, .
Guarantee of freedom of speech
* This provision has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Gitlow v. New York&quot;, and &quot;Stromberg v. California&quot;, .
Guarantee of freedom of the press
* This provision has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Gitlow v. New York&quot;, Near v. Minnesota, .
Guarantee of freedom of assembly
* This provision has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See De Jonge v. Oregon&quot;, .
Guarantee of the right to petition for redress of grievances
* This provision has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Edwards v. South Carolina&quot;, . 
Guarantee of freedom of expressive association
* This right, though not in the words of the first amendment, was first mentioned in the case &quot;NAACP v. Alabama&quot;, and was at that time applied to the states. See also &quot;Roberts v. United States Jaycees&quot;, , where the U.S. Supreme Court held that &quot;implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment&quot; is &quot;a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.&quot;

===Amendment II===
Right to keep and bear arms

* This right has been incorporated against the states. The Second Amendment was described as a fundamental and individual right that will necessarily be subject to strict scrutiny by the courts, &quot;see McDonald v. City of Chicago&quot; (2010). Self Defense is described as &quot;the central component&quot; of the Second Amendment in &quot;McDonald&quot; and upheld &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; 554 U.S (2008) concluding the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, recognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.

* The right to carry bearable arms outside the home has been incorporated against the states, &quot;see New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot; (2022).

===Amendment III===
Freedom from quartering of soldiers
* This provision has been incorporated against the states within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but has &quot;not&quot; been incorporated against the states elsewhere. The Supreme Court has not yet heard an appeal about applying this protection in all states.

In 1982, the Second Circuit applied the Third Amendment to the states in &quot;Engblom v. Carey&quot;. This is a binding authority over the federal courts in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, but is only a persuasive authority over the other courts in the United States.

The Tenth Circuit has suggested that the right is incorporated because the Bill of Rights explicitly codifies the &quot;fee ownership system developed in English law&quot; through the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, and the Fourteenth Amendment likewise forbids the states from depriving citizens of their property without due process of law. &quot;See United States v. Nichols&quot;, 841 F.2d 1485, 1510 n.1 (10th Cir. 1988).

===Amendment IV===
Unreasonable search and seizure
* This right has been incorporated against the states by the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;, , although there is &quot;dicta&quot; in &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot;, , saying the &quot;core&quot; of the Fourth Amendment applied to the States.
* The remedy of exclusion of unlawfully seized evidence, the exclusionary rule, has been incorporated against the states. See &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;. In &quot;Mapp&quot;, the Court overruled &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot; in which the Court had ruled that the exclusionary rule did not apply to the states.

Warrant requirements
* The various warrant requirements have been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Aguilar v. Texas&quot;, .
* The standards for judging whether a search or seizure undertaken without a warrant was &quot;unreasonable&quot; also have been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Ker v. California&quot;, .

===Amendment V===
Right to indictment by a grand jury
* This right has been held &quot;not to be&quot; incorporated against the states. &quot;See Hurtado v. California&quot;, 110 U.S. 516 (1884).
Protection against double jeopardy 
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Benton v. Maryland&quot;, . However, this is generally limited by the doctrine of dual sovereignty, according to which a conviction, or acquittal, in federal court does not prevent a conviction in state court for the same crime, and a conviction in a court of one state does not prevent a conviction for the same action in a court of another state. &quot;See&quot; &quot;Bartkus v. Illinois,&quot; , &quot;Heath v. Alabama,&quot; , &quot;Gamble v. United States&quot; (2019).
Constitutional privilege against self-incrimination
* This right has been incorporated against the states.
*# Self Incrimination in Court &quot;See Griffin v. California&quot;, 380 U.S. 609 (1965), &quot;Malloy v. Hogan&quot;, .
*# Miranda &quot;See Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, .
* A note about the &quot;Miranda&quot; warnings: The text of the Fifth Amendment does not require that the police, before interrogating a suspect whom they have in custody, give him or her the now-famous &quot;Miranda&quot; warnings. Nevertheless, the Court has held that these warnings are a necessary prophylactic device, and thus required by the Fifth Amendment in order to introduce a suspect&#x27;s statements against him or her as part of a prosecutor&#x27;s case-in-chief whether in state or federal court. The Court has held in &quot;Vega v. Tekoh&quot; that failure to provide Miranda warnings does not, by itself, violate the Fifth Amendment.
Right to Due Process of Law

* This right has not formally been incorporated, with the Court reasoning that the Fourteenth Amendment already protects due process of law against state violation. It first defended the Fourteenth Amendment as protecting due process of law at the state level in &quot;Scott v. McNeal&quot;, 154 U.S. 34, at 45 (1894).

Protection against taking of private property without just compensation
* This right has been incorporated against the states. See &quot;Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago&quot;, 166 U.S. 226 (1897).

===Amendment VI===
Right to a speedy trial
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Klopfer v. North Carolina&quot;, .
Right to a public trial
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See In re Oliver&quot;, .
Right to trial by impartial jury
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Duncan v. Louisiana&quot;, , which guarantees the right to a jury trial in non-petty cases. &quot;See also &quot;, , where the Supreme Court ruled &quot;that the statements of the bailiff to the jurors are controlled by the command of the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It guarantees that &#x27;the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial, by an impartial jury ...&#x27;&quot; However, the size of the jury vary between federal and state courts. Even so, the Supreme Court has ruled that a jury in a criminal case may have as few as six members. &quot;Williams v. Florida&quot;, . Furthermore, there is no right to a jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings held in state court. &quot;See McKeiver v. Pennsylvania&quot;, . The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Ramos v. Louisiana&quot; (2020) that a unanimous jury vote requirement for criminal convictions is further incorporated against the states, overturning the prior &quot;Apodaca v. Oregon&quot; (1972) which had allowed states to make this determination on its own.
Right to a jury selected from residents of the state and district where the crime occurred
*This right has &quot;not been&quot; incorporated against the states. &quot;See Zicarelli v. Dietz&quot;, 633 F.2d 312 (3rd Cir. 1980). In &quot;Zicarelli v. Gray&quot;, 543 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1976), a lower federal court &quot;assumed&quot; that state governments could not violate the vicinage right. The Supreme Court has not yet heard a case concerning application of this federal right to the state level.
Right to notice of accusations
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See In re Oliver&quot;, . &quot;See also Rabe v. Washington&quot;, .
Right to confront adverse witnesses
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Pointer v. Texas&quot;, .
Right to compulsory process (subpoenas) to obtain witness testimony
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Washington v. Texas&quot;, .
Right to assistance of counsel
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Powell v. Alabama&quot; , for capital cases, &quot;see Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, for all felony cases, and &quot;see Argersinger v. Hamlin&quot;, for imprisonable misdemeanors. In subsequent decisions, the Court extended the right to counsel to any case in which a jail sentence is imposed. 
* However, the right to petition a federal court for relief against ineffective assistance of state-level council has &quot;not&quot; been incorporated against the states if the evidentiary basis for such a procedure was not introduced into the state trial record. &quot;See&quot; &quot;Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez&quot;, 596 U.S. ___ (2022).

===Amendment VII===
Right to jury trial in civil cases
* This right has &quot;not been&quot; incorporated against the states. &quot;See&quot; &quot;Dohany v. Rogers&quot;, , &quot;Walker v. Sauvinet&quot;, 92 U.S. 90 (1876). In &quot;Walker&quot;, Justice Morrison Waite ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not compel states to provide jury trials for civil matters because states &quot;are left to regulate trials in their own courts in their own way. A trial by jury in suits at common law pending in the State courts is not, therefore, a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.&quot;
Re-Examination Clause
* This right has &quot;not been&quot; incorporated against the states. &quot;See The Justices v. Murray&quot;, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 274 (1870), &quot;and Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis&quot;, . The right prevents federal courts from retrying a civil jury case without following common law procedures, but not state courts. As the Court ruled in &quot;Justices&quot;, &quot;the seventh amendment could not be invoked in a State court to prohibit it from re-examining, on a writ of error, facts that had been tried by a jury in the court below.&quot;

===Amendment VIII===
Protection against excessive bail
*This right may have been incorporated against the states. In &quot;Schilb v. Kuebel&quot;, 404 U.S. 357 (1971), the Court stated in dicta: &quot;Bail, of course, is basic to our system of law, and the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot; In &quot;Murphy v. Hunt&quot;, , the Court did not reach the issue because the case was dismissed as moot. Bail was included in the list of incorporated rights in &quot;McDonald&quot; footnote 12, citing &quot;Schilb&quot;.
Protection against excessive fines
*This right has been incorporated against the states. See &quot;Timbs v. Indiana&quot; (2019), in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority &quot;For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties.&quot; 
Protection against cruel and unusual punishments
* This right has been incorporated against the states. &quot;See Robinson v. California&quot;, . This holding has led the Court to suggest, in dicta, that the excessive bail and excessive fines protections have also been incorporated. &quot;See Baze v. Rees&quot;, 128 S. Ct. 1520, 1529 (2008).

==Reverse incorporation==
A similar legal doctrine to incorporation is that of reverse incorporation. Whereas incorporation applies the Bill of Rights to the states through the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, equality before the law is required under the laws of the federal government by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
For example, in &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot;, , which was a companion case to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the schools of the District of Columbia were desegregated even though Washington is a federal enclave. Likewise, in &quot;Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña&quot; , an affirmative action program by the federal government was subjected to strict scrutiny based on equal protection.

<text>Old Colwyn (, formerly &quot;Colwyn&quot; bilingually) is a large village just to the east of Colwyn Bay, in Conwy County Borough, Wales.

Prior to local government reorganisation in April 1974 it was part of the Municipal Borough of Colwyn Bay, but the reorganisation established it as a separate community, whose population at the 2001 census was 7,626, increasing to 8,113 at the 2011 census. It hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1941. It also harbours the 3rd Colwyn Bay (Old Colwyn) Scout Group headquarters and is home to the area&#x27;s comprehensive school, Ysgol Bryn Elian.

== Amenities ==
Old Colwyn has an area of woodland called the &#x27;Fairy Glen&#x27;. This area of woodland is said to contain many different spirits including fairies, hence its name, which dates from the Victorian era and is a common name from that period (e.g. the &quot;Fairy Glen&quot; in Penmaenmawr). This area has recently undergone a regeneration with funding from the council and it is now possible to walk through it easily. The Fairy Glen is subject to an ownership dispute between Conwy County Borough Council and the water company, Dŵr Cymru, each claiming that the maintenance of the area is the responsibility of the other.

Old Colwyn was once overlooked by the Hotel 70 Degrees, (just above Tan-y-Lan) so named because the architect who designed it used 70 degree angles in its construction. Built in 1972, it was demolished in 2007, to be replaced by a housing development. It also has easy access onto the promenade and beach, as well as a protruded cliff area known as Penmaenhead, marked by a disused stone utility house. This is a popular spot amongst teenagers for the dangerous practice of &quot;cliff jumping&quot; when tide is in and the water is deep enough, though to date nobody has been hurt.

==History==
In 1334, the village was mentioned in a government survey as &quot;Coloyne&quot;.

In 1685, the village was known as &quot;Colwun&quot; and had a population of twenty.

Following the Census Act 1800, Colwyn had a population of 150 with twenty-three cottages, twelve farms and two inns.

During the nineteenth century, the village of Colwyn became increasingly known as &quot;Old Colwyn&quot; to distinguish it from the newly formed town of Colwyn Bay (initially called &quot;New Colwyn&quot;) to the west.

In 1884, Old Colwyn railway station opened (briefly initially named &quot;Colwyn railway station&quot;) on the North Wales Coast Line.

In December 1952, the railway station closed; however, both the line and a street called &quot;Station Road&quot; remain.

Since 1984, Colwyn Bay Football Club&#x27;s ground has been situated on Llanelian Road, Old Colwyn.

==Former tramway==
The Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Electric Railway operated an electric tramway service between Llandudno and Rhos-on-Sea from 1907 and extended to Colwyn Bay in 1908. The service closed in 1956.

==Education==
Old Colwyn has one infant school (Ysgol T. Gwyn Jones), one primary school (Ysgol Hen Golwyn), and one secondary school (Ysgol Bryn Elian).

<text>The Hoekse Waard (; pre-1947 spelling: Hoeksche Waard) is an island between the Oude Maas, Dordtsche Kil, Hollands Diep, Haringvliet and Spui rivers in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. The island, part of the namesake municipality of Hoeksche Waard, is a mostly agricultural region, south of the outskirts of Rotterdam. The Hoeksche Waard consists of reclaimed land (polders): after the Saint Elisabeth flood of 1421 most of the area was flooded. The land has been reclaimed gradually in the following centuries.

==Former municipalities==
The Hoeksche Waard formerly consisted of the following municipalities until these were merged on 1 January 2019:

* Binnenmaas (villages Blaaksedijk, Heinenoord, Goidschalxoord, Maasdam, Mijnsheerenland, Puttershoek, Westmaas and &#x27;s-Gravendeel)
* Cromstrijen (villages Klaaswaal and Numansdorp)
* Korendijk (villages Goudswaard, Nieuw-Beijerland, Piershil and Zuid-Beijerland, and the island of Tiengemeten)
* Oud-Beijerland 
* Strijen (villages Cillaarshoek, Mookhoek, Strijen and Strijensas)

==Surrounding waters==
The Hoeksche Waard is separated:
*from IJsselmonde island on the north by the Oude Maas (tunnel)
*from Voorne-Putten island on the west by the Spui (ferry)
*from the island of Dordrecht on the east by the Dordtsche Kil (tunnel)
*from Goeree-Overflakkee island on the southwest by the Haringvliet (bridge)
*from the Province of North Brabant on the southeast by the Hollands Diep (bridge)

<doc id="1301923" wikidata="Q3472599" url="?curid=1301923" title="Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk">
<text>The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk is an oceanfront amusement park in Santa Cruz, California. Founded in 1907, it is California&#x27;s oldest surviving amusement park and one of the few seaside parks on the West Coast of the United States.

== Description ==

The boardwalk extends along the coast of the Monterey Bay, from just east of the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf to the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. At the western edge of the park lies a large building originally known as The Plunge, now Neptune&#x27;s Kingdom, a pirate-themed recreation center which contains a video arcade and an indoor miniature golf course. Next to this is the Casino Fun Center which includes a laser tag arena and next to that is the Cocoanut Grove banquet room and conference center. A Laffing Sal automated character, from San Francisco&#x27;s Playland, is viewable near the miniature golf course.

East of the casino, the boardwalk portion of the park stretches along a wide, sandy Main Beach visitors can access easily from the park. The eastern end of the boardwalk is dominated by the Giant Dipper, a wooden roller coaster that is one of the most visible landmarks in Santa Cruz. The Dipper and the Looff Carousel, which still contains its original 342-pipe organ built in 1894, are both on the US National Register of Historic Places. They were, together, declared to be a National Historic Landmark in 1987 and the park is California Historical Landmark number 983.

There are old-fashioned carnival games and snack booths throughout the park. It is located at 400 Beach Street in Santa Cruz, south of the Ocean Street exit of California State Route 1, which is the southern terminus of California State Route 17.

==History==

Fred W. Swanton formed the Santa Cruz Beach, Cottage, and Tent City Corporation in 1903 and the following year, the City of Santa Cruz granted permission for commercial buildings to be built. On 14 June 1904, the Neptune Casino opened with an arcade, grill and dining room, and a theater.

The beach was a destination for railroads and trolleys from 1875. From 1927 to 1959, Southern Pacific Railroad ran &quot;Suntan Special&quot; excursion trains to the beach from San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose every summer Sunday and holiday. A short passenger service to Roaring Camp via the San Lorenzo river canyon in Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park was restored in 1985 by the Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway, which stops in front of the park.

, the park is headed by Charles Canfield, the son of Laurence Canfield, the president of the park from the 1950s until the early 1980s. It has won the Best Seaside Amusement Park Award from &quot;Amusement Today&quot; every year since 2007 except for 2015. Although there is no admission and the beach is public, a parking fee is charged when the rides are open. Season or day passes can be purchased or individual points for $1; each ride costs between 5 and 8 tickets.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the park shut down in mid-March 2020. The park reopened on November 7, 2020. The park then subsequently shut down on November 10, 2020, due to Santa Cruz County re-entering the Substantial tier of the California Blueprint for a Safer Economy. The park then re-opened select rides to California residents on April 1, 2021.

==Boardwalk&#x27;s Cocoanut Grove==
The Boardwalk&#x27;s Cocoanut Grove conference center includes banquet rooms and a performing arts venue. Food, drink, and theater were profitable aspects of the resort since the original Casino of Swanton in 1904. Although gambling was never legal, it was generally known that guests could take boats from the &quot;pleasure pier&quot; to a ship in the harbor to play games of chance in the early days. During Prohibition from 1920 to 1933, serving alcoholic drinks was also outlawed and the casino changed its name to Cocoanut Grove. The name includes an old spelling of Coconut, &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;, which was used in the popular Marx Brothers movie &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; of 1929. The name was also used by a number of popular nightclubs of the era, including one in The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Cocoanut Grove was a popular spot for major big band acts, including Stan Kenton, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton and Tommy Dorsey.

Today, Cocoanut Grove rarely hosts musical acts. It is a venue for weddings, banquets, school formal occasions and reunions, and corporate events. The Grand Ballroom and Sun Room complexes include over of space and commercial kitchens.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Smith (February 2, 1923 – November 12, 2017) was an American gossip columnist. She was known as &quot;The Grand Dame of Dish&quot;. Beginning her career in radio in the 1950s, for a time she also anonymously wrote the &quot;Cholly Knickerbocker&quot; gossip column for the Hearst newspapers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, she was the entertainment editor for the magazines &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot; Between 1976 and 2009, she wrote a self-titled gossip column for newspapers including &quot;New York Newsday&quot;, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot; that was syndicated in 60 to 70 other newspapers. On television, she appeared on Fox, E!, and WNBC.

== Early life ==
Smith was born on February 2, 1923, in Fort Worth, Texas. She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in journalism in 1949, and she worked for &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; and &quot;The Texas Ranger&quot;.

==Career==
Smith later moved to New York City, where she worked as a typist, proofreader, and reporter before she broke into the media world as a news producer for Mike Wallace at CBS Radio. She spent five years as a news producer for NBC-TV. She also worked for Allen Funt on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;.

In the late 1950s, Smith worked as a ghostwriter for the &quot;Cholly Knickerbocker&quot; gossip column syndicated in the Hearst newspapers. After leaving that column in the early 1960s, she began working for Helen Gurley Brown as the entertainment editor for the American version of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, later working simultaneously as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s entertainment editor as well. Between 1971 and 1976, Smith was one of the ghostwriters behind &quot;The Gossip Column&quot; by Robin Adams Sloan, which was syndicated by King Features.

On February 16, 1976, Smith began a self-titled gossip column for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. During the 1978 New York City newspaper strike, her &quot;Daily News&quot; editors asked her to appear daily on WNBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Live at Five&quot;, and she stayed with the program for eleven years. Her exposure on television made Smith a regular figure on the Manhattan social scene and provided fodder for her column, which had, by then, been syndicated to nearly seventy newspapers. She won an Emmy for her reporting on &quot;Live at Five&quot; for WNBC in 1985.

Smith was hired by Fox Broadcasting Company heads Barry Diller and Rupert Murdoch to develop a talk show, with Roger Ailes as her producer.

Smith was once reportedly the highest-paid print journalist in the United States. In 1991, shortly after her exclusive interviews with Ivana Trump at the time of her divorce from real-estate entrepreneur Donald Trump, Smith moved her column to &quot;New York Newsday&quot;, staying until that paper closed in 1995 and then continuing in both the Long Island &quot;Newsday&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot; simultaneously. She worked for Fox News for seven years and was last on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;. She was the only columnist to ever have her column printed in three major New York City papers at the same time.

In April 2005, Smith left &quot;Newsday&quot; following a contract dispute. The official discontinuation of her column came after several months of dispute among Smith, her lawyer David Blasband, and &quot;Newsday&quot; management. The matter was settled out of court and Smith continued at the &quot;New York Post&quot; and the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;.

On February 24, 2009, the &quot;Post&quot; announced that the paper would stop running Smith&#x27;s column effective February 26, 2009, as a cost-cutting measure.

Smith, along with Lesley Stahl, Mary Wells Lawrence, and Joni Evans, was a founding member of wowOwow.com, a website for women to talk culture, politics, and gossip.

Smith was honored as The New Jewish Home&#x27;s Eight Over Eighty Gala 2016 honoree.

==Personal life==
Smith married her college sweetheart, World War II bombardier George Edward Beeman, in 1945. She soon left him to enroll at the University of Texas at Austin, where her papers and memorabilia are kept in the Dolph Briscoe Center, and they divorced two years later. In 1957, she married Fred Lister; the couple divorced in 1962.

Smith acknowledged her bisexuality (or as she referred to it, &quot;gender neutrality&quot;) in her memoirs, but in the December 5, 2000, issue of &quot;The Advocate&quot;, she dug deeper and confided in editor-in-chief Judy Wieder that it was not in her nature to be a role model in the LGBT movement. However, she admitted &quot;I think that my relationships with women were always much more emotionally satisfying and comfortable (than with men). And a lot of my relationships with men were more flirtatious and adversarial. I just never felt I was wife material. I always felt that I was a great girlfriend.&quot; Beginning in the late 1970s, the archaeologist Iris Love lived with Smith romantically for 15 years.

Smith was a good friend of Texas Governor Ann Richards, and she helped Richards to acculturate to New York City society after leaving Texas. Smith was also good friends with Texan pundit and writer Molly Ivins, also a friend of Richards.

Smith raised millions of dollars for charities, $6 million for Literacy Partners, millions for AMFAR, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, PAL, and the Mayor&#x27;s Fund to Advance New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

==Death==
On November 12, 2017, Smith died at her home in Manhattan of natural causes at age 94.

<text>Rhosllanerchrugog (; standardised and also spelled as Rhosllannerchrugog, or simply Rhos) is a village and community in Wrexham County Borough, Wales. It lies within the historic county of Denbighshire. The entire built-up area including Penycae, Ruabon and Cefn Mawr had a population of 25,362.

==Etymology==
The name of the village is derived from that of the old Llanerchrugog estate, once one of the landholdings of Cynwrig ap Rhiwallon, Lord of Maelor Gymraeg. 
The name &quot;Llanerchrugog&quot; is usually stated to be based on Welsh &quot;llannerch&quot; (&quot;clearing&quot; or &quot;glade&quot;), and (with soft mutation), &quot;&quot; (&quot;heathery&quot;), although an etymology based on &quot;crugog&quot; (&quot;hilly&quot; or &quot;rough&quot;) has also been suggested. The name of the mining village which later grew up on nearby moorland was usually written as &quot;Rhos Llanerchrugog&quot;, (&quot;the Llanerchrugog moor&quot;, literally &quot;moor, heath of the heather glade&quot;) in the early and mid-19th century, but later often became written as &quot;Rhos-llanerchrugog&quot; and finally as a single word. The spelling &quot;Rhosllannerchrugog&quot; has also been used since 1997 as an alternative to the legal community name.

Locally, it is usually known simply as &quot;Rhos&quot;, or (in Welsh English) as &quot;the Rhos&quot;. In the dialect of the area this is invariably pronounced [&#x27;r̥əus], in opposition to the Standard Welsh [r̥oːs].

==History==
The village was originally within the ancient parish of Ruabon and the township of Morton Above (i.e. Morton, or moor town, above Offa&#x27;s Dyke) or Morton Wallichorum (the &quot;Welsh Morton&quot;). In 1844 Morton Above, along with part of the neighbouring township of Dynhinlle Ucha, became part of the newly created parish of Rhosllanerchrugog.
 The Llanerchrugog estate itself was owned by the Jones family from at least the 1400s to the 19th century; in 1649 the landowner John Jones of Llanerchrugog claimed a detailed genealogy going back 2400 years to Dyfnwal Moelmud, and attempted to use his ancient rights of ownership to argue he should be exempt from taxes.

The development of the village can be attributed largely to the coal seams of north-east Wales that pass near it. The burgesses of Holt were granted the right to dig for coal at Rhos in their borough charter of 1563. A coal mining community was established during the 18th century, and grew substantially from the 1840s onwards. Unlike many other mining villages in the district and in other parts of Wales, the majority of early immigration to Rhos was from Welsh-speaking upland agricultural areas in West Wales, giving the village a distinct linguistic identity which it has retained until the present day. The proportion of Welsh-speakers in Rhos did not fall below 50% until the time of the 1981 census.

By the early 18th century the Rhosllanerchrugog mines were the property of the future Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 3rd Baronet, of Wynnstay, a member of the area&#x27;s major landowning family and a prominent Jacobite. At the accession of George I in August 1714, Williams-Wynn incited the miners of Rhos to march to Wrexham, singing Jacobite songs, to sack two Dissenting meeting houses, to smash the windows of Whig tradesmen and to prevent the bells of Wrexham church ringing to celebrate the accession.

The available notes of Mr Kenrick, minister of the New Meeting, dispute many of these assertions. In Wrexham, it was on July 15, 1715 (before George I&#x27;s accession), that Tory resentment overflowed into riots that were mainly directed at the Dissenters. The New Meeting House was destroyed and the Old Meeting House was badly damaged. The colliers came into town on July 20, 1715 to help and protect the rioters. Upon request from the Dissenters, Watkin Williams-Wynn interceded and persuaded the men to desist. Sporadic rioting continued, at least until October 20, 1715, which was the King&#x27;s Coronation Day.

The Jacobite politics of the district&#x27;s landlord and his tenants is popularly thought to be the source of the nickname &quot;Jackos&quot; or &quot;Jacos&quot; still applied to inhabitants of Rhos.

A symbol of Rhos&#x27; coal-mining and labour movement heritage is seen in the &quot;Stiwt&quot;, the miners&#x27; institute in Broad Street. This was erected and paid for by the miners, during the general strike of 1926, as, a social and cultural centre for the community. The Welsh Religious Revival of 1904 also had a major impact on Rhos. The cynghanedd &quot;Beibl a Rhaw i Bobl y Rhos&quot; (&quot;a bible and a spade for the people of Rhos&quot;) reflects the importance of both coal-mining and the chapels on the village&#x27;s culture and heritage. The later strength of Nonconformity in Rhos became one of the village&#x27;s distinctive features, along with its dialect, working-class institutions, and tradition of education, which for decades meant that no school in the area &quot;[seemed] complete without a teacher from Rhos on the staff&quot;.
Rhos hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1945 and 1961, and the Celtic League was founded there in 1961 during the Eisteddfod. The many informal fringe performances around this event were memorialised in the poem &quot;The Cross Foxes&quot; by Harri Webb, remembering the night when in Rhos &quot;we drank the pub dry&quot;.

With a population of over 10,000, the modern community of Rhosllanerchrugog is one of the largest in Wales. The 2011 census showed that the population of the built-up area of Rhosllanerchrugog including adjoining Pen-y-cae is 13,501. The area retains a proportion of Welsh speakers above the national average, despite the loss of older speakers and the impact of non-Welsh speakers moving into the area: the 2001 Census showed that 31.5% of the community area was Welsh speaking, declining to 24% at the 2011 census. Welsh medium education is, however, popular and significantly increasing in the area.

==Architecture==
Rhos contains a number of listed public buildings. Notable buildings in the village include:

The Stiwt Theatre, formerly the &quot;Miners&#x27; Institute&quot; (&quot;Plas Mwynwyr&quot;), which was built in 1926 to the designs of John Owen of Wrexham and F. A. Roberts, Mold. The Institute closed in 1977, following which the local council purchased the building in 1978. They decided to demolish the building in 1985, but it was saved as a result of local campaigning. Following fundraising efforts, it was renovated and reopened as a community theatre. The Stiwt Theatre holds the Wrexham young people&#x27;s music festival since 2006. The Stiwt now do various shows and the grade II* listed building is open to the public to see.
Church of St John Evangelist A grade II listed building, built in 1852 to a design by Thomas Penson and consecrated on 4 October 1853. A good example of a Romanesque Revival church, it is Norman style, with coursed and squared sandstone and slate roofs. It has a cruciform plan with nave, transept and chancel and bell tower in the angle of the south transept and the chancel. The church closed in 2004. The churchyard contains war graves of a British and a Canadian soldier of the First World War.

St David&#x27;s Welsh Church, built in 1892 to a design by Douglas and Fordham of Chester. Since the closure of St. John&#x27;s, this is used as the parish church.

Penuel Chapel (Capel Penuel) Two-storey Welsh Baptist chapel built in 1856–59, with a brick façade installed during renovations performed in 1891 to the designs of Owen Morris Roberts, Porthmadog. The chapel was the starting point site of R. B. Jones&#x27;s campaign in the village during the religious revival in 1904–05. One of the chapel&#x27;s ministers was Lewis Valentine.

Capel Bach, officially Bethlehem Welsh Independent Chapel, Hall Street. First built in 1812 and rebuilt in 1839, 1876 and (also to designs by architect Owen Morris Roberts of Porthmadog) in 1889. A large, two-storey Romanesque chapel with integral clock tower and canted stair tower: grade II listed as a prominent feature of Rhos and an unusual example of a Rundbogenstil facade. There is a 1908 organ by Norman and Beard: the composer Caradog Roberts was the organist here between 1904 and 1935.

Capel Mawr, officially Jerusalem Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, Brook Street, is a grade II listed chapel, built of stone in a classical gable-entry style. It was first built in 1770 and rebuilt in 1876 to the designs of Richard Owen of Liverpool. Fittings include a war memorial tablet and a 1927 stained glass window by Jones and Willis.

==Religious Revival 1904-1905==
Rhos was one of the centres of the Welsh Religious Revival of 1904–1905. R. B. Jones, a visiting Baptist preacher, held a campaign in Penuel Baptist Chapel, Rhosllanerchrugog in November 1904.

==Musical heritage==

Rhos is known for its musical heritage, and has a concert hall at the Stiwt Theatre. Composers from the village include Caradog Roberts, best known for the hymn tune &quot;Rachie&quot;; and Arwel Hughes, conductor and composer of the hymn tune &quot;Tydi a Roddaist&quot;. Notable performers from Rhos include the baritone James Sauvage and pianist Llŷr Williams.

Rhos has several choirs, including the Rhos Male Voice Choir (&quot;Côr Meibion Rhosllannerchrugog&quot;); the Rhos Orpheus Male Voice Choir (&quot;Côr Orffiws Y Rhos&quot;); Johns&#x27; Boys Male Chorus (&quot;Côr Meibion Johns&#x27; Boys&quot;); a Pensioners&#x27; Choir (&quot;Côr Pensiynwyr Rhosllannerchrugog&quot;); a Girls&#x27; Choir (&quot;Côr Merched Rhosllannerchrugog&quot;); and the Rhos Singers (Cantorion Rhos), a mixed voice choir. The male voice choirs have performed in many countries.

The &quot;Rhos Prize Silver Band&quot; was formed in 1884, but later became known as the &quot;Hafod Colliery Band&quot;. After the closure of Hafod Colliery in 1968 the band was renamed &quot;Rhos and District Silver Band&quot;. In 2001, the band changed its name to &quot;Wrexham Brass&quot; and is now based at the Glyndŵr University campus in Wrexham.

==Dialect==
The village is well known for its unique dialect of the Welsh language, which has been the subject of several academic studies. Although having some similarities to the dialects of both North-East and Mid Wales, it has been described as &quot;unlike anything else heard in Wales&quot; and as frequently unintelligible to outsiders.

As well as features found elsewhere in North Wales, such as the loss of final [v] in words such as &quot;araf&quot;, &quot;slow&quot; (here pronounced [&#x27;ara]) or of final [ð] in words such as &quot;ffordd&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, (here pronounced [fɔr]), the dialect shows numerous distinctive consonants and examples of metathesis. Vowels also differ widely from modern standard Welsh: one of its key features is the diphthongisation of vowels [e] and [o], as seen in the vowel of the name &quot;Rhos&quot;, locally [&#x27;r̥əus]. Another typical feature is the contraction of verbal phrases, so that for example (&quot;I had&quot;) is rendered as [&#x27;ogai] and (&quot;I have to&quot;) as [&#x27;haimi]. These features are to an extent becoming lost in younger speakers under the influence of Welsh medium education.

The Rhos dialect is also known for a unique vocabulary. The main example is a word that has become synonymous with the village: the demonstrative adjective &quot;nene&quot; (pronounced approximately [neːneː]), meaning &quot;that&quot;, or more specifically &quot;that over there&quot;. While the related forms &quot;ene&quot; (&quot;that&quot;) and &quot;dene&quot; (&quot;there [...] is&quot;) are found in other parts of North-East Wales, &quot;nene&quot; is specific to Rhos.

The word&#x27;s association with the village is reflected in the title of the community&#x27;s monthly newspaper, &quot;Nene&quot;, founded by the campaigner and local historian Ieuan Roberts (&quot;Ieu Rhos&quot;, 1949–2016). In usage &quot;Nene&quot; is also combined with &quot;ene&quot;; an example is the question &quot;Be &#x27;di nene ene?&quot; - &quot;What&#x27;s that there?&quot;

==Cemetery controversy==
In September 2006, letters were sent by Rhos Community Council to relatives of people buried in the village&#x27;s cemetery, where former Miss World Rosemarie Frankland is buried, asking them to limit the number of floral tributes left at grave sites. The council reportedly planned to cover the cemetery with a lawn and feared that such tributes would breach health and safety rules. Feeling the council had handled the issue insensitively, relatives collected an 850-signature petition and 60 families made a public protest.

==Stiwt Theatre==

The Stiwt is a 490-seater theatre located in the village. Founded in 1926 by the Miner&#x27;s Institute, (lending it its name, &#x27;Stiwt&#x27; coming from the word &#x27;Institute&#x27; in &#x27;Miner&#x27;s Institute&#x27;), the day-to-day running of the Stiwt was paid for by weekly contributions from the Miner&#x27;s wages. Paying in 20d a week, the Stiwt was both built and run by the wages of the Miners, the descendants of which continually have to fight to keep it open after almost facing closure in 1977, 1996 and 2016. Today the Stiwt is funded and run by Wrexham County Borough Council, the Arts Council of Wales, Rhos Community Council and Friends of the Stiwt.

==Transport==
The village was once linked to the Great Western Railway by the Rhos Branch, which ran to the village from nearby Wrexham via Rhostyllen and Legacy Station (near Talwrn, named after the short-lived Legacy colliery). Passenger services opened with great celebration on 1 October 1901, with around a thousand people carried on the first day. In 1905 the passenger service was extended to halts at Brook Street (the location of the Rhos goods station), Pant and (via the former Ruabon Brook Tramway) Wynn Hall, although goods trains ran through to Froncysyllte wharf on the Shropshire Union Canal via Plas Bennion and Acrefair. Passenger services were discontinued in 1931, except for Saturday football specials which ran occasionally until 1951-1952. To the East of Rhos a second line had been laid in 1868 North from Gardden Lodge Junction (near Ruabon) and extended as far as Bryn-yr-Owen colliery, and in 1874 was extended to the Legacy Colliery (which suspended production in mid-1874 with the loss of 111 jobs never to resume). When the Rhos Branch was built it linked to this line at Legacy Junction, and in 1905 the Great Western Railway introduced passenger services from Wrexham via Legacy Station, with halts at Fennant Road, Aberderfyn and trains terminating at the halt at Ponkey Crossing. The line was referred to as the Ponkey Branch line. The passenger services were withdrawn in 1915, and the line from Legacy junction was lifted a few years later, though the line south from Ponkey gasworks continued in use for freight until 1964.

Rhosllannerchrugog was also the end of the line of the Wrexham and District Electric Tramways. The tram service began operating in 1903, and originally ran from Penybryn in Wrexham to the New Inn in Johnstown, but this was soon extended up Gutter Hill to Duke Street in Rhos. The company had its depot and staging area in nearby Johnstown. The trams were eventually and gradually replaced by buses owned by the same company, which was renamed the Wrexham &amp; District Transport Company; for many years tram lines were visible outside the garage at the bottom of Gutter Hill.

Several local companies operated bus services in the village. The red and cream buses of Phillips &amp; Son of Rhostyllen ran from Wrexham to Rhos via Johnstown, and at one time on to Tainant, from 1927 until it was taken over by Crosville in 1979. T. Williams &amp; Sons ran a service from Rhos to Wrexham from the 1920s until 1986. The last surviving independent local company, Wright &amp; Son, ran a service from Pen-y-cae to Wrexham via Rhos, and later via Ponciau also. When the bus industry was deregulated in 1986 there was fierce competition between Wright&#x27;s and the much larger Crosville. Wright&#x27;s ceased operations in 1993, leaving Crosville as the sole service provider in the area. Crosville itself became part of the Arriva group, which still operates a frequent bus service between Rhos and Wrexham city centre.

The nearby A483 road provides links to Liverpool and Manchester to the north and Birmingham, Swansea and Cardiff to the south.

<text>Where the Red Fern Grows is a 1961 children&#x27;s novel by Wilson Rawls about a boy who buys and trains two Redbone Coonhounds for hunting. It is a work of autobiographical fiction based on Rawls&#x27; childhood in the Ozarks.

==Plot==

The novel begins in 1961 when a middle-aged man by the name of Billy Colman rescues a redbone hound from neighborhood dogs and takes it home to recover. The incident reminds him of the faithful dogs he owned as a child in the Ozarks.

The story then travels decades prior to a ten-year-old Billy seeking a pair of redbone hounds for coon hunting. After seeing a magazine ad for coon hounds, he spends the next two years working odd jobs to earn the $50 he needs to buy a pair of pups and walks 20 miles to Tahlequah to retrieve them. As he returns with the dogs, he sees the names &quot;Dan + Ann&quot; carved on a tree and names the pups Old Dan and Little Ann. With his grandfather&#x27;s help, he trains them to hunt.

On the first night of hunting season, Billy promises Old Dan and Little Ann that if they tree a raccoon, he will do the rest. They do so in a huge sycamore tree, which he believes is far too large to chop down. Remembering his promise, Billy spends the next two days attempting to cut down the sycamore. Exhausted, he prays for the strength to continue, whereupon a strong wind blows down the tree.

Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann become renowned as the best hunters in the Ozarks. Billy&#x27;s grandfather bets Rubin and Rainie Pritchard that Old Dan and Little Ann can tree the legendary &quot;ghost coon&quot; that has evaded hunters for years. After a challenging hunt, Old Dan and Little Ann succeed in treeing the ghost coon, but Billy, having seen how old and clever the animal is, decides not to kill it. Billy tries to prevent Rubin and Rainie from killing the ghost coon, and this leads to a brawl with Rubin. During the fight, Rubin&#x27;s dog attacks Billy, prompting Old Dan and Little Ann to come to his aid. Rubin attempts to scare Old Dan and Little Ann away with Billy&#x27;s ax, but he falls on the blade and dies. Although Billy is deeply troubled by the tragic turn of events, he does not regret his decision to spare the ghost coon.

Billy&#x27;s grandfather enters him in a championship raccoon hunt against experienced hunters. The hunt is scheduled during a particularly cold week, and many of the hunters give up. Billy, who is used to harsh mountain winters, can reach the final round. On the last night, Old Dan and Little Ann trap three raccoons in a single tree, but a sudden blizzard forces Billy to take shelter. The following morning, Old Dan and Little Ann are found covered with ice but still circling the tree. All three raccoons are captured and Billy wins the championship and a $300 prize.

One night while the trio is hunting, a mountain lion attacks Old Dan and Little Ann. Billy fights to save them, but the mountain lion turns on him. The dogs kill the mountain lion, saving Billy&#x27;s life, but Old Dan later dies of his injuries. Over the next few days, Little Ann loses the will to live and finally dies of grief, leaving Billy heartbroken.

Billy&#x27;s father tries to comfort him by explaining that he and Billy&#x27;s mother had long wished to move to a town where their children can get an education, but could not afford to do so without the extra money brought in by Billy&#x27;s hunting. Knowing that Old Dan and Little Ann would suffer in town and that Billy would be devastated to leave them behind, they intended to allow him to remain in the mountains with his grandfather. His father believes that God took Old Dan and Little Ann as a sign that the family was meant to stay together.

On his last day in the Ozarks, Billy visits Old Dan and Little Ann&#x27;s graves and finds a giant red fern growing between them. Remembering a legend that only an angel can plant a red fern, he also comes to believe a higher power was at work.

Billy closes by saying that although he has never returned to the Ozarks, he still dreams of visiting Old Dan and Little Ann&#x27;s graves and seeing the red fern again.

==Films==
The novel was adapted into a 1974 film starring Stewart Petersen, James Whitmore, Beverly Garland, and Jack Ging. A sequel was released in 1992, starring Wilford Brimley, Chad McQueen, Lisa Whelchel, and Karen Carlson. A remake was released in 2003, starring Joseph Ashton, Dabney Coleman, Ned Beatty, and Dave Matthews.

==Reception==

Although sales of the novel began slowly, by 1974 over 90,000 copies had been sold. In 2001, Publishers Weekly estimated that it had sold 6,754,308 copies.

There is a statue of Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann at the Idaho Falls Public Library.

<text>Woodrow Wilson Rawls (September 24, 1913 – December 16, 1984) was an American writer best known for his books &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot; and &quot;Summer of the Monkeys&quot;.

==Early years==
Woodrow Wilson Rawls was born in the Ozark Mountains near Scraper, Oklahoma in 1913, to parents Minzy Rawls and Winnie Hatfield Rawls. His family&#x27;s farm was located on his mother&#x27;s Cherokee government allotment. When Rawls was 16, the United States economy entered the Great Depression, prompting his family to leave their Oklahoma home for California; however, the family&#x27;s convertible broke down near Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Rawls&#x27;s father found a job at the nearby toothpaste factory. Despite his sporadic formal education, Rawls was taught to read by his mother and developed a love of books after reading the wilderness adventure novels of Jack London.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Rawls became a carpenter and traveled to South America, Canada, and Alaska. He wrote five manuscripts during this period, including an early version of &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;. Rawls&#x27;s scripts contained many spelling and grammatical errors and no punctuation. Because of this, he kept the manuscripts hidden in a trunk in his father&#x27;s workshop.

Rawls served time in prison twice while in Oklahoma. According to the &quot;Bear Grease&quot; podcast, Episode 42, Rawls was imprisoned for 18 months in 1933 for the crime of stealing chickens. In 1940, in New Mexico, he again served time for breaking and entering and was sentenced to two to three years. During this term in prison, he worked to refine his writing skills, though he still felt that his lack of formal education meant that the novels were not fit for publication.

In the late 1950s, Rawls worked for a construction company on a guided missile range in the Southwest. Later, he transferred to a construction site near Idaho Falls to work on a contract for the Atomic Energy Commission. Rawls lived in a cabin near Mud Lake. While working there, Rawls met his future wife, Sophie Ann Styczinski, a budget analyst for the Atomic Energy Commission. The couple married on August 23, 1958.

Prior to his marriage, Rawls destroyed all his hidden manuscripts, embarrassed for his wife to read them. Learning of this, Sophie encouraged Rawls to recreate one of the stories. Rawls allegedly completed the 35,000 word manuscript in three weeks. Sophie assisted him in editing the manuscript and submitted it to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post,&quot; which published it in three parts under the title &quot;The Hounds of Youth&quot; in 1961. Doubleday purchased the story and published it as &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows.&quot;

<doc id="1301946" wikidata="Q7097829" url="?curid=1301946" title="Operator-precedence parser">
<text>In computer science, an operator-precedence parser is a bottom-up parser that interprets an operator-precedence grammar. For example, most calculators use operator-precedence parsers to convert from the human-readable infix notation relying on order of operations to a format that is optimized for evaluation such as Reverse Polish notation (RPN).

Edsger Dijkstra&#x27;s shunting yard algorithm is commonly used to implement operator-precedence parsers.

== Relationship to other parsers ==

An operator-precedence parser is a simple shift-reduce parser that is capable of parsing a subset of LR(1) grammars. More precisely, the operator-precedence parser can parse all LR(1) grammars where two consecutive nonterminals and epsilon never appear in the right-hand side of any rule.

Operator-precedence parsers are not used often in practice; however they do have some properties that make them useful within a larger design. First, they are simple enough to write by hand, which is not generally the case with more sophisticated right shift-reduce parsers. Second, they can be written to consult an operator table at run time, which makes them suitable for languages that can add to or change their operators while parsing. (An example is Haskell, which allows user-defined infix operators with custom associativity and precedence; consequently, an operator-precedence parser must be run on the program &quot;after&quot; parsing of all referenced modules.)

Raku sandwiches an operator-precedence parser between two recursive descent parsers in order to achieve a balance of speed and dynamism. GCC&#x27;s C and C++ parsers, which are hand-coded recursive descent parsers, are both sped up by an operator-precedence parser that can quickly examine arithmetic expressions. Operator-precedence parsers are also embedded within compiler-compiler-generated parsers to noticeably speed up the recursive descent approach to expression parsing.

== Precedence climbing method ==
The precedence climbing method is a compact, efficient, and flexible algorithm for parsing expressions that was first described by Martin Richards and Colin Whitby-Strevens.

An infix-notation expression grammar in EBNF format will usually look like this:
expression ::= equality-expression
equality-expression ::= additive-expression ( ( &#x27;==&#x27; | &#x27;!=&#x27; ) additive-expression ) *
additive-expression ::= multiplicative-expression ( ( &#x27;+&#x27; | &#x27;-&#x27; ) multiplicative-expression ) *
multiplicative-expression ::= primary ( ( &#x27;*&#x27; | &#x27;/&#x27; ) primary ) *
primary ::= &#x27;(&#x27; expression &#x27;)&#x27; | NUMBER | VARIABLE | &#x27;-&#x27; primary
With many levels of precedence, implementing this grammar with a predictive recursive-descent parser can become inefficient. Parsing a number, for example, can require five function calls: one for each non-terminal in the grammar until reaching &quot;primary&quot;.

An operator-precedence parser can do the same more efficiently. The idea is that we can left associate the arithmetic operations as long as we find operators with the same precedence, but we have to save a temporary result to evaluate higher precedence operators. The algorithm that is presented here does not need an explicit stack; instead, it uses recursive calls to implement the stack.

The algorithm is not a pure operator-precedence parser like the Dijkstra shunting yard algorithm. It assumes that the &quot;primary&quot; nonterminal is parsed in a separate subroutine, like in a recursive descent parser.

=== Pseudocode ===

The pseudocode for the algorithm is as follows. The parser starts at function &quot;parse_expression&quot;. Precedence levels are greater than or equal to 0.

 parse_expression()
 return parse_expression_1(parse_primary(), 0)

 parse_expression_1(lhs, min_precedence)
 &quot;lookahead&quot; := peek next token
 while &quot;lookahead&quot; is a binary operator whose precedence is &gt;= &quot;min_precedence&quot;
 &quot;op&quot; := &quot;lookahead&quot;
 advance to next token
 &quot;rhs&quot; := &quot;parse_primary&quot; ()
 &quot;lookahead&quot; := peek next token
 while &quot;lookahead&quot; is a binary operator whose precedence is greater
 than &quot;op&quot;&#x27;s, or a right-associative operator
 whose precedence is equal to &quot;op&quot;&#x27;s
 &quot;rhs&quot; := &quot;parse_expression_1&quot; (&quot;rhs&quot;, precedence of &quot;op&quot; + (1 if &quot;lookahead&quot; precedence is greater, else 0))
 &quot;lookahead&quot; := peek next token
 &quot;lhs&quot; := the result of applying &quot;op&quot; with operands &quot;lhs&quot; and &quot;rhs&quot;
 return &quot;lhs&quot;

Note that in the case of a production rule like this (where the operator can only appear once):
equality-expression ::= additive-expression ( &#x27;==&#x27; | &#x27;!=&#x27; ) additive-expression
the algorithm must be modified to accept only binary operators whose precedence is &gt; &quot;min_precedence&quot;.

=== Example execution of the algorithm ===

An example execution on the expression 2 + 3 * 4 + 5 == 19 is as follows. We give precedence 0 to equality expressions, 1 to additive expressions, 2 to multiplicative expressions.

&quot;parse_expression_1&quot; (&quot;lhs&quot; = 2, &quot;min_precedence&quot; = 0)
* the lookahead token is +, with precedence 1. the outer while loop is entered.
* &quot;op&quot; is + (precedence 1) and the input is advanced
* &quot;rhs&quot; is 3
* the lookahead token is *, with precedence 2. the inner while loop is entered.&lt;br&gt;&quot;parse_expression_1&quot; (&quot;lhs&quot; = 3, &quot;min_precedence&quot; = 2)
:* the lookahead token is *, with precedence 2. the outer while loop is entered.
::* &quot;op&quot; is * (precedence 2) and the input is advanced
::* &quot;rhs&quot; is 4
::* the next token is +, with precedence 1. the inner while loop is not entered.
::* &quot;lhs&quot; is assigned 3*4 = 12
::* the next token is +, with precedence 1. the outer while loop is left.
:* 12 is returned.
* the lookahead token is +, with precedence 1. the inner while loop is not entered.
* &quot;lhs&quot; is assigned 2+12 = 14
* the lookahead token is +, with precedence 1. the outer while loop is not left.
* &quot;op&quot; is + (precedence 1) and the input is advanced
* &quot;rhs&quot; is 5
* the next token is ==, with precedence 0. the inner while loop is not entered.
* &quot;lhs&quot; is assigned 14+5 = 19
* the next token is ==, with precedence 0. the outer while loop is not left.
* &quot;op&quot; is == (precedence 0) and the input is advanced
* &quot;rhs&quot; is 19
* the next token is &quot;end-of-line&quot;, which is not an operator. the inner while loop is not entered.
* &quot;lhs&quot; is assigned the result of evaluating 19 == 19, for example 1 (as in the C standard).
* the next token is &quot;end-of-line&quot;, which is not an operator. the outer while loop is left.
1 is returned.

== Pratt parsing ==

Another precedence parser known as Pratt parsing was first described by Vaughan Pratt in the 1973 paper &quot;Top Down Operator Precedence&quot;, based on recursive descent. Though it predates precedence climbing, it can be viewed as a generalization of precedence climbing.

Pratt designed the parser originally to implement the CGOL programming language, and it was treated in much more depth in a Masters Thesis under his supervision.

* Tutorial using Java: &quot;Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing Made Easy&quot; (2011) by Bob Nystrom, author of Crafting Interpreters
* Implementation in C#: &quot;Gratt: A Generic Vaughn Pratt&#x27;s top-down operator precedence parser for .NET Standard&quot; (a generic version inspired by the Java implementation presented by Bob Nystrom in &quot;Pratt Parsers: Expression Parsing Made Easy&quot;)

== Alternative methods ==

There are other ways to apply operator precedence rules. One is to build a tree of the original expression and then apply tree rewrite rules to it.

Such trees do not necessarily need to be implemented using data structures conventionally used for trees. Instead, tokens can be stored in flat structures, such as tables, by simultaneously building a priority list which states what elements to process in which order.

=== Full parenthesization ===
Another approach is to first fully parenthesize the expression, inserting a number of parentheses around each operator, such that they lead to the correct precedence even when parsed with a linear, left-to-right parser. This algorithm was used in the early FORTRAN I compiler:
The Fortran I compiler would expand each operator with a sequence of parentheses. In a simplified form of the algorithm, it would
* replace codice_1 and codice_2 with codice_3 and codice_4, respectively;
* replace codice_5 and codice_6 with codice_7 and codice_8, respectively;
* add codice_9 at the beginning of each expression and after each left parenthesis in the original expression; and
* add codice_10 at the end of the expression and before each right parenthesis in the original expression.
Although not obvious, the algorithm was correct, and, in the words of Knuth, “The resulting formula is properly parenthesized, believe it or not.”

Example code of a simple C application that handles parenthesisation of basic math operators (codice_1, codice_12, codice_5, codice_6, codice_15, codice_16 and codice_17):

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

// The command-line argument boundary is our lexer.
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 int i;
 printf(&quot;((((&quot;);
 for (i=1; i!=argc; i++) {
 // strlen(argv[i]) == 2
 if (argv[i] &amp;&amp; !argv[i][1]) {
 switch (*argv[i]) {
 case &#x27;(&#x27;: printf(&quot;((((&quot;); continue;
 case &#x27;)&#x27;: printf(&quot;))))&quot;); continue;
 case &#x27;^&#x27;: printf(&quot;)^(&quot;); continue;
 case &#x27;*&#x27;: printf(&quot;))*((&quot;); continue;
 case &#x27;/&#x27;: printf(&quot;))/((&quot;); continue;
 case &#x27;+&#x27;:
 // unary check: either first or had an operator expecting secondary argument
 if (i == 1 || strchr(&quot;(^*/+-&quot;, *argv[i-1]))
 printf(&quot;+&quot;);
 else
 printf(&quot;)))+(((&quot;);
 continue;
 case &#x27;-&#x27;:
 if (i == 1 || strchr(&quot;(^*/+-&quot;, *argv[i-1]))
 printf(&quot;-&quot;);
 else
 printf(&quot;)))-(((&quot;);
 continue;
 }
 printf(&quot;%s&quot;, argv[i]);
 printf(&quot;))))\n&quot;);
 return 0;


First, you need to compile your program. Assuming your program is written in C and the source code is in a file named program.c, you would use the following command:

The above command tells gcc to compile program.c and create an executable named program.

Command to run the program with parameters, For example; a * b + c ^ d / e
it produces

as output on the console.

A limitation to this strategy is that unary operators must all have higher precedence than infix operators. The &quot;negative&quot; operator in the above code has a higher precedence than exponentiation. Running the program with this input

produces this output

which is probably not what is intended.

<text>Talukina Ramaswamayya Subba Rao (1920–1984), popularly known as TaRaSu, was an Indian novelist and a scholar in the Kannada-language. He is considered as a harbinger of the Navya movement of Kannada literature. He is well known for his novels like &quot;Durgashtamana&quot;, which won him the Sahitya Akademi award posthumously in 1985.

==Early life==
TaRaSu was born on 21 April 1920 in Malebennur in the Mysore state of British India (present day Karnataka state of India). His father Ramaswamaiah was a lawyer in the town of Harihar and his mother was Seethamma. His ancestors were from the village of Taluku in the Chitradurga district of Karnataka. He wrote his first story called &quot;Puttana Chendu&quot; (Putta&#x27;s ball) to win a bet against his uncle TS Venkannaiah who made self-less contribution to Kannada language through promoting many prominent authors. When he was 17 years old, he joined the Indian freedom movement and went around the villages in the Chitradurga district, singing patriotic songs and giving speeches for independence. He was arrested and jailed when he was giving one of the speeches in Bagur village.

Fearing that his son would lose out on education by joining the freedom movement, Ramaswamaiah admitted his son to the National School in Bangalore. After completing his secondary education, TaRaSu joined a college in Shimoga. After completing his junior intermediate education, he joined a college in Tumkur to complete senior intermediate education. However, the students started boycotting the classes due to the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and others during the Quit India movement. He and his friends started making plans to join the movement. This came to the notice of the police, who arrested TaRaSu and jailed him. He was released in the month of December 1942. He decided that he was not going to study further unless India attains independence. He was an atheist in early life but converted into a believer in the later stages.

==Family==
TaRaSu comes from a literary family. Subbarao was married to Ambuja. His niece Vishalakshi Dakshinamurthy, is a notable Kannada Novelist and writer famous for her novel based film Jeevana Chaitra which starred Rajkumar, well known Kannada Actor. TaSu Sham Rao, was also related to TaRaSu.
==Career==

===As a journalist===
In 1942, TaRaSu went to Bangalore and joined as a sub-editor for the Kannada newspaper, &quot;VishwaKarnataka&quot;, earning a sum of Rs. 25 as salary per month. During this period, he married &quot;Ambuja&quot;. He later worked for the &quot;Prajamatha&quot;, &quot;Vahini&quot; and &quot;Navodaya&quot; newspapers. His career in journalism also included a stint with &quot;Prajavani&quot;, &quot;Mysuru&quot;, &quot;Kaladoota&quot; and &quot;Vicharavani&quot; newspapers.

===As a writer===
TaRaSu was initially influenced by the Pragatisheela writings of the Kannada scholar A. N. Krishna Rao. Hence, his initial writings belong to the pragatisheela style and contain novels like &quot;Purushavatara&quot; and &quot;Munjavininda Munjavu&quot;. These writings mainly deal with the issues faced by the downtrodden and the lower caste society. Occasionally, he also came up with novels that were not of this genre, like &quot;Chandavalliya Thota&quot; which was based on a Gandhian theme of rural life in India. Some of his most celebrated novels include &quot;Masanada Hoovu&quot;, which talks about the plight of prostitutes and &quot;Hamsa Geethe&quot;, which talks about the life of a musician in the context of Chitradurga being passed from the hands of the Palegars to Hyder Ali. Both of these novels have been made into films in Kannada. &quot;Hamsageethe&quot; was chosen as a text book for graduation classes and a Hindi film, Basant Bahar, was based on it.

TaRaSu has also written many historical novels, the most famous being Durgaastamana (fall of the Durga fort), which won him the Sahitya Akademi award in 1985. This was the last novel that he wrote and it talks of the fall of Chitradurga Palegars under the hands of Hyder Ali. His another historical novel based on Chitradurga&#x27;s history is &quot;Kambaniya Kuyilu&quot; and its sequels &quot;Tirugubana&quot; and &quot;Raktaratri&quot;. He also wrote a novel called &quot;Shilpashree&quot; which is based on Chavundaraya, the person who commissioned the statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola. For nearly two decades, much of the historical source material for his numerous novels were sufficed by the eminent Indian historian S. Srikanta Sastri. Sastri even wrote an erudite and scholarly foreword to one of Ta. Ra. Su.&#x27;s famous novels – &quot;Nrupatunga&quot;. TaRaSu experimented with various narrative styles and was the first author to introduce the stream-of-consciousness literary technique in Kannada. He also used the Indian independence movement as a background in his novels, like &quot;Rakta Tarpana&quot;. When the Navya (modernist) movement of Kannada literature was in its infancy, TaRaSu contributed to its growth by coming up with various books belonging to this genre, like his collection of short stories, &quot;Girimalligeya Nandanadalli&quot; which shows the confusion during the shift from progressive to modernist form of literature.

==Later life==
TaRaSu had planned to write many more books but they remained incomplete. This includes his autobiography, &quot;Hindirugi Nodidaaga&quot; (As I look back). He died on 10 Apr 1984. The autobiography was completed by his wife and released in 1990.

<doc id="1301953" wikidata="Q17091071" url="?curid=1301953" title="Grafton saxophone">
<text>The Grafton saxophone was an injection moulded, cream-coloured acrylic plastic alto saxophone with metal keys, manufactured in London, England by the Grafton company, and later by &#x27;John E. Dallas &amp; Sons Ltd&#x27;. Grafton made only altos, owing to the manufacturing challenges presented by larger models (e.g., the tenor) with 1950s plastic technologies. Production commenced in 1950 and ended after approximately ten years. However, a few last examples were assembled from residual parts circa 1967. All tools, machinery, and jigs required to manufacture the Grafton were sold for scrap and subsequently destroyed in 1968.

==Design==
Designed by Ettore Sommaruga, an Italian living in London, the saxophone was named after &quot;Grafton Way&quot;, his address during the early 1950s. The basic saxophone design was patented in late 1945. Creation of the first non-working prototype took place in 1946, and commercial production commenced in 1950. The selling price of the Grafton was £55 i.e. approximately half the cost of a conventional brass saxophone at that time. Contemporary marketing literature described the Grafton as a &quot;Tone poem in ivory and gold&quot;. The decision to make it mainly from acrylic glass like perspex was motivated simply because of its much lower cost and ease of production, rather than improvement in tonal qualities. The serial number on a Grafton appears in an unusual location: it is stamped onto the main body of the saxophone (and highlighted in black) at the front, approximately 2 cm above the front F key which is operated by the player&#x27;s left hand. Serial numbers run to a maximum of five digits. Serial numbers running up to at least 13,571 are known to exist.

==Inadequacies==

The Grafton saxophone, in spite of the fame gained from its use by Charlie Parker and Ornette Coleman, failed to gain acceptance among professional saxophone players due to a variety of reasons.

The acrylic plastic used for the body is brittle, resulting in an extremely fragile instrument. Any component parts made of plastic can easily crack, fracture or snap off during normal use. Not only do Graftons use a non-standard spring mechanism to operate the action, but spare parts are unavailable. Not surprisingly, Graftons are challenging and expensive to overhaul or repair when compared to saxophones made entirely of metal.

The mechanical action of Graftons has an unusual &quot;spongy&quot; feel to it, without the quick, &quot;snappy&quot;, positive feel of other more conventional saxophone actions, which was disconcerting to players.

The plastic body and bell of the Grafton creates a sound very similar to a conventional brass saxophone, as the sound of a saxophone is created by the player, mouthpiece and cone of air, the body material having no influence on tone. The Grafton was used for artistic effect by Ornette Coleman on his album, &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot;.

For these reasons, and their comparative rarity, it is unusual to see a Grafton being played by performers in the 21st century. As a general rule, Graftons are now regarded purely as collectors&#x27; items i.e. for display purposes only. This is because they are fragile and very easy to damage, which detracts from their monetary value.

==Notable players==

===Charlie Parker===
The most notable player of a Grafton saxophone was Charlie Parker. While in Toronto, Charlie Parker and &quot;the quintet&quot; were scheduled to perform at Massey Hall, but Parker had pawned his saxophone - some sources say to buy heroin. A sales representative for Grafton (or the owner of the company, depending on the source) asked Parker to use a Grafton for a Massey Hall gig in May 1953. Although Parker was under exclusive contract to use only one type of saxophone while gigging in the United States, outside the U.S. he was free to use any sax he wished. Parker (credited as Charlie Chan due to contract issues) can be heard playing this Grafton on the album &quot;Jazz at Massey Hall&quot; with Bud Powell, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus and Max Roach, albeit through a low fidelity recording. The Grafton saxophone that Parker used (serial number 10265) was sold at the Christie&#x27;s auction house in London in September 1994 for £93,500 sterling. The buyer was the American Jazz Museum, located in Parker&#x27;s home town of Kansas City, Missouri.

===Ornette Coleman===
Ornette Coleman used to play a Grafton (that he purchased in 1954) originally because it was the cheapest saxophone he could replace his first tenor with after it was broken. In the late fifties and early sixties, Coleman was sometimes known as &quot;the man with the plastic horn&quot;. However, Coleman subsequently replaced his Grafton with a white-lacquered Selmer alto instead.

=== John Dankworth ===
English jazz composer, saxophonist and clarinetist John Dankworth was an early endorser. The Grafton company provided him with two altos, specially customised to his requirements. During the Festival of Britain in 1951, the &quot;John Dankworth Seven&quot; (with Dankworth playing a Grafton) performed at the newly opened Royal Festival Hall in London.

=== Ade Monsbourgh ===
Australian Ade Monsbourgh was given an acrylic alto saxophone by the Grafton Saxophone Company UK, during the Bell Second Tour C1951-1952. The multi-instrumentalist is perhaps best known for his work with Graeme Bell&#x27;s band with which he twice toured Europe and England in the 1940s. These tours had a significant impact, as did Monsbourgh&#x27;s own playing. Indeed, he was offered a job in the band of English jazz musician Humphrey Lyttelton but turned it down. Back in Australia, he played in Len Barnard&#x27;s band, became a resident guest musician at the Melbourne Jazz Club and later played and recorded with Neville Stribling in Lazy Ade&#x27;s Late Hour Boys and Adelaide composer Dave Dallwitz. Wrtiting in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Australian Jazz&quot;, Bruce Johnson said that Monsbourgh, also known as &quot;The Father&quot; or &quot;Lazy Ade&quot;, was &quot;one of the most original and influential jazz musicians Australia has produced&quot;. &quot;His distinctive approach, both in terms of timing, harmonic line and, especially on alto, his timbre, is central to what is widely, if controversially regarded as the &#x27;Australian&#x27; or &#x27;Melbourne&#x27; jazz style.&quot; Johnson also said that Monsbourgh has been copied &quot;more productively than any other Australian jazz musician, including by overseas musicians&quot;. In 2003, Monsbourgh won the Graeme Bell Career Achievement Award at the inaugural Australian Jazz Awards.

===David Bowie===
David Bowie asked his father to lend him money to buy himself a saxophone. His father bought him the saxophone but made David agree to pay him back with the money he made from his part-time job. He can be heard discussing this in a BBC interview.

===Florian Trübsbach===
Since 2011 , Professor at the University for Music and Performing Arts Munich, has played a Grafton alto exclusively.

==Legacy==
The Grafton saxophone remains a historical curiosity and a footnote to the careers of Charlie Parker and Ornette Coleman among jazz buffs. The Vibratosax represents another attempt to produce a low cost saxophone made of plastic. However, it remains to be seen whether that venture has solved the mechanical and durability issues that plagued the Grafton. Whether or not the various issues surrounding plastic saxophones can be solved with more modern plastics or composites to the satisfaction of players and repair technicians remains a matter of speculation.

<doc id="1301969" wikidata="Q60449" url="?curid=1301969" title="Joseph Berchtold">
<text>Joseph Berchtold (6 March 1897 – 23 August 1962) was an early senior Nazi Party member and a co-founder of both the (SA) and (SS).

Berchtold served in World War I and upon Germany&#x27;s defeat joined the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP), a small extremist organization at the time. He remained in the party after it became known as the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP) and went on to become the second commander of the (SS) from April 1926 to March 1927.

After resigning as the SS leader, Berchtold spent much of his time writing for Nazi magazines and journals. He survived the war, but was arrested by the Allies. Berchtold was later released and died in 1962. He was the last surviving person to hold the rank of and the only one to survive the Second World War.

==Early life==
Born on 6 March 1897 in Ingolstadt, Berchtold attended school in Munich from 1903 to 1915. He went on to serve in the Royal Bavarian Army during World War I (1914-18) and held the rank of second lieutenant at the end of the war. After the war, he studied economics at the University of Munich and gained employment as a journalist. In early 1920, he joined the small right-wing extremist group the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP). He remained in the party after it became known as the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP). Berchtold became the treasurer of the Nazi Party, until he resigned at the end of July 1921.

==SA career==

Upon re-joining the party in 1922, Berchtold became a member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment&quot;; SA), a paramilitary wing formed to protect its speakers at rallies, and to police Nazi meetings. Adolf Hitler, leader of the party since 1921, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his protection instead of less trustworthy ordinary party members in 1923. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Berchtold. It was initially designated the &quot;Stabswache&quot; (&quot;Staff Guard&quot;). Later that year, the unit was renamed &quot;Stoßtrupp-Hitler&quot; (&quot;Shock Troop-Hitler&quot;).

On 9 November 1923 the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, took part in what would become known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The plan was to first take control of Munich, then Bavaria and then seize total power by marching on Berlin, much like how Mussolini and his Blackshirts had done in Italy. The coup d&#x27;état failed and resulted in the death of 16 Nazis, three police officers, and one bystander. In the aftermath of the putsch both Hitler and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, were officially disbanded and outlawed. Berchtold ended up fleeing to Tirol, Austria. He was tried in absentia in Munich before the special People&#x27;s Court in 1924 for his role in the Beer Hall Putsch and sentenced to a prison term. During his time in Austria, Berchtold continued to be involved with Nazi Party activities, even though it was illegal.

When Hitler was released from prison on 20 December 1924, Berchtold was District Director of the Nazi Party in Carinthia, Austria and was leader of the SA there. After the re-formation of the Nazi Party on 20 February 1925, he rejoined it, documented as member #964. In March 1926, Berchtold returned to Munich from Austria. He became chief of the SA in Munich not long after.

==SS career==
On 15 April 1926, Berchtold became the successor to Schreck as chief of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;Protection Squadron&quot;; SS), a special elite branch of the party under the control of the SA. Berchtold changed the title of the office position which became known as the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. He issued new rules to establish the position of the SS. The rules stated the unit was &quot;...neither a military organisation nor a group of hangers-on, but a small squad of men that our movement and our Führer can rely on.&quot; He further stressed that the men must follow &quot;only party discipline&quot;. He was considered to be more dynamic than his predecessor, but was still unable to keep the party organizers at bay. He was frustrated in his efforts to have a more independent unit and became disillusioned by the SA&#x27;s authority over the SS. On 1 March 1927, he handed over leadership of the SS to his deputy Erhard Heiden.

==After the SS==
In 1927, he became a lead writer for &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, the Nazi Party newspaper. From 1928 to 1945, Berchtold was an SA leader, serving on the staff of the Supreme SA leadership (OSAF). In 1934, he became the permanent deputy editor-in-chief of the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;. In the following years, he was primarily a Nazi Party journalist and propagandist. In 1928, Berchtold founded the newspaper &quot;SA-Mann&quot; (&quot;SA Man&quot;), which was published by the OSAF. Until January 1938, he was its main writer. Berchtold was also the author of various Nazi publications and on the staff of additional magazines.

Additional posts in Nazi Germany were of secondary importance to Berchtold. From March 1934 to the end of the war, Berchtold served on the town council in Munich. On 15 November 1935, Berchtold was appointed Reich Culture Senator. In addition, he belonged to the &quot;Cultural Circle of the SA&quot; since 6 March 1936, and to the Reichstag from 29 March 1936. From 29 April 1940, Berchtold served as a captain of the reserve on a temporary basis in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

==Post-war==
After World War II in Europe ended, Berchtold was arrested in 1945 and interned at Oberpfaffenhofen. He died on 23 August 1962, in Herrsching am Ammersee, near Munich.

<text>John Fife Symington III (born August 12, 1945) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 19th governor of Arizona from 1991 until his resignation in 1997. A member of the Republican Party, he resigned from office following convictions on charges of extortion and bank fraud – convictions which were later overturned. Prior to entering politics, Symington served in the United States Air Force and was stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Arizona.

A native of New York City, Symington attended the Gilman School in Baltimore; he subsequently graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Dutch art history. Symington comes from a political family: his father, J. Fife Symington Jr., served as Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago; his cousin Stuart Symington was a U.S. Senator from Missouri. After joining the Air Force in 1967 and achieving the rank of captain, Symington was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service. He was honorably discharged in 1971. He remained in Arizona and became a real estate developer, founding his own company, the Symington Company, in 1976.

Symington was elected to the governorship in 1990 over Democratic Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, following a close campaign that resulted in a runoff election. During his first term, Symington established charter schools in Arizona by signing sweeping education reform legislation, with the first charter schools opening in the state in 1995. The following year, during his second term, Symington signed legislation to establish the Arizona Water Bank Authority as a separate agency, allowing excess water to be acquired from the Central Arizona Project and banked in Arizona for future necessity. His term in office also oversaw the first temporary closure of Grand Canyon National Park during the federal government shutdown in November 1995. In 1997, Symington was convicted on seven counts of bank fraud, and resigned from office, but the convictions were later overturned. Before the government could retry him, Symington was pardoned in January 2001 by President Bill Clinton, whom he once saved from a rip tide off of Connecticut during his youth.

After his term as governor, Symington left public service and pursued a career as a chef, later co-founding the Arizona Culinary Institute with his business partners Jerry Moyes, Darren Leite and chef Robert E. Wilson. He has been speculated as a possible candidate for another term as Governor of Arizona, as well as considered running for the United States Senate, but has only endorsed candidates since leaving the Governor&#x27;s office. Symington is also known as a witness to the infamous Phoenix Lights, a mass UFO sighting which occurred in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997.

==Early life and career==
Symington was born in New York City, New York on August 12, 1945. Symington comes from a wealthy Maryland family; he is the great-grandson of steel magnate Henry Clay Frick. Symington was born to Martha Howard (née Frick), and J. Fife Symington Jr. who served as United States Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago from 1969 to 1971 under President Richard Nixon. He is also a cousin to Stuart Symington, who was U.S. Senator from Missouri from 1953 to 1976.

He attended Gilman School in Baltimore, and then went to Harvard University, graduating in 1968 with a degree in Dutch art history. During his time at Gilman, Symington met Thomas Caplan, who would later introduce him to Bill Clinton during college. At 19 years old, Symington rescued an intoxicated 19-year-old Clinton from nearly drowning in a rip tide during a trip to Hyannis Port, Massachusetts near the Kennedy compound. While studying at Harvard, Symington discovered the works of Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Hayek, an economist, social theorist and political philosopher who promoted limited government and free markets. Hayek&#x27;s work would serve as an influence for Symington&#x27;s political beliefs in regards to fiscal and taxation policy as governor. Symington was also a supporter of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election against Lyndon B. Johnson. Beginning in 1967, he served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War, and was stationed at Luke Air Force Base near Glendale, Arizona. In 1971, he was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service, before being honorably discharged. He remained in Arizona and became involved in real estate development, founding his own company, The Symington Company, in 1976. In 1983, he was appointed to Southwest Savings and Loan Association board of directors which was based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Beginning in 1983, one of Symington&#x27;s projects as a real estate developer, with The Symington Company, was the construction of the Esplanade on 24th Street and Camelback Road, an up-scale office complex that had been built on a former Christmas tree lot. Symington believed it to be the &quot;best location in town for business,&quot; and as of 2007, still had his own office on the fourth floor of the building. The financing of the project would later play a part in an investigation in his involvement with Southwest Savings and Loan, which provided the funds with Symington on its board of directors. Symington has stated that the approval of the construction of the Esplanade was significant because nothing over four stories had ever been granted along Camelback Road. The Esplanade took two decades to finish construction, with construction beginning in 1983, and completing in 2003.

Other development projects launched by The Symington Company include the Scottsdale Seville, as well as the Mercado, a shopping complex near downtown Phoenix whose design was influenced by southwestern and Hispanic culture. The Mercado was a concept that originated from Phoenix City Hall, which granted the first ever federal Urban Development Action Grant in Phoenix for the complex, and also owned the land that the Mercado was built upon. The Mercado opened in 1989, but it began facing financial hardships only a few years after its opening. Additionally, in an attempt to finance the construction of the Mercado, Symington repeatedly filed false financial statements, according to a jury in the case that later led to his resignation as governor, to receive a $10 million loan for the project from a group of Arizona pension funds. It was also alleged that Symington threatened to end the lease granted to Arizona State University, the largest tenant at the Mercado at the time, several times between July and October 1991, unless he was released from the $10 million loan. The Mercado loan officially went into default in 1992, with Symington filing for bankruptcy protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

==Governor of Arizona==
===1990 gubernatorial campaign===

In April 1989, Symington announced his bid for Governor of Arizona in the 1990 election, promising to run the state like a business. Beginning with the initial stages of his campaign, Symington had placed his business expertise and his success as a real estate developer center stage, stating, &quot;What Arizona needs right now is a business mind. The state needs a man who can provide experienced, professional fiscal management to pull it out of its economic crisis. I am that man.&quot; In the Republican primary held on September 11, 1990, Symington was opposed by several high-profile career politicians, including former governor Evan Mecham, who had been impeached in 1988 and was attempting to make a comeback. Former U.S. Congressman Sam Steiger, who had previously run for U.S. Senate as the Republican nominee in 1976 and for Governor as the Libertarian nominee in 1982 also ran against Symington, but placed a distant fourth behind Mecham and State Senator Fred Koory. Despite being portrayed as a liberal by his primary opponents, Symington received nearly 44% of the vote in the primary.
In his election night speech, Symington immediately began his general election campaign message by stating that his Democratic opponent, Terry Goddard, was &quot;a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal Democrat,&quot; and, in contrast, that he was a Barry Goldwater conservative, and &quot;proud of it.&quot; At the time, Goldwater was seen as the ideological godfather of the modern Republican Party, and had endorsed Symington&#x27;s campaign. Symington&#x27;s father was also personal friends with Goldwater.

In the general election, the Democratic Party nominee was Terry Goddard, who had served as the mayor of Phoenix until February of that year. Goddard is also the son of former Arizona Governor Samuel Pearson Goddard Jr. During the campaign, Goddard had attempted to cast doubt on Symington in the minds of voters by stating that the former businessman could face indictment for his business activities. In response, Symington charged that Goddard had violated the state&#x27;s campaign finance law by &quot;accepting a law-firm salary while campaigning, without spending the stipulated hours on legal work.&quot; One of Symington&#x27;s campaign promises included a state budget cut of 6%, except for programs related to education and the poor. On election day in November 1990, the presence of several write-in candidates resulted in Symington and Goddard being virtually tied, with Symington ahead by only 4,300 votes. Prior to the election, Arizona had adopted runoff voting in general elections if no candidate received more than 50% of the vote. This came after the controversial Evan Mecham had been elected governor in 1986 with only 40% of the vote. As a result, a runoff was scheduled for February 26, 1991. Both candidates spent a cumulative total of approximately $5 million in the primary, general and runoff campaigns.

Shortly before the runoff occurred, while in Washington, D.C. for a fundraiser, Symington was called before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee by Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a move that was seen as politically motivated. During the hearing, U.S. Senator Bob Dole accused the Democrats of a political &quot;sneak attack&quot; on Symington, a line which was later used in a Symington campaign commercial. The commercial also depicted Goddard behind bars, as the ad&#x27;s narrator asks: &quot;How can anyone trust Terry Goddard, when the fact is he&#x27;s broken the law?&quot; Symington would go on to win the runoff with 52% of the vote. After the extended campaign, Arizona returned to plurality voting for all subsequent gubernatorial elections, making the 1990 gubernatorial election the only statewide runoff election in Arizona&#x27;s history.

===First term (1991–1995)===

Symington was sworn into office on March 6, 1991, becoming Arizona&#x27;s fourth governor in five years. Symington&#x27;s first budget as governor, which totaled more than $3.5 billion, was successfully passed through the state legislature, earning him &quot;high marks&quot; from political analysts at the time, due to its lack of tax increases, as well as for its halting of an incineration project. The project had caused controversy due to the amount of hazardous waste that was being created. Symington also established an extensive review of its human resources management, and created the State Long-Term improved Management Project (known as Project SLIM). The goal of the project was to reduce the size of the state government and decrease spending. Recommendations that were made as a result of the project included methods for improving the hiring process, improving training, providing alternative processes for employee appeals, reducing overall employment, and upgrading the classification, pay, and benefits system, among other suggestions.

Symington&#x27;s accounting firm had won the consulting contract for Project SLIM, which later led to an investigation, and resulted in a $3.3 million settlement due to inquiries into the bidding by other state and federal investigative agencies. Governor Symington, and other former directors of Southwest Savings and Loan, were also the subject of an investigation over their involvement in the failure of the Phoenix-based thrift, with the case later being settled for $12 million.

In November 1992, Symington ended a six-month standoff with the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation by signing a compact that allowed the tribe to operate 250 video gambling machines. Prior to this, the tribe was acting in defiance of federal agents who had seized their gambling machines the year before the agreement. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation settled for a quarter of the machines that had been seized, and also agreed to allow state supervision of the gambling operation. In return, the state conceded to allowing the operation of a 24-hour bingo hall and casino by the tribe. Former Arizona Attorney General Jack LaSota criticized the decision at the time, due to Arizona&#x27;s state laws against gambling. Symington later signed legislation in 1993 that reversed this decision, however, outlawing gambling and casinos, including for fundraising purposes for churches and charities. Also in November 1992, Symington was a supporter of a ballot proposal that reinstated Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in Arizona. The day had been removed as a federal holiday several years prior, under the administration of Governor Evan Mecham, who disagreed with its manner of implementation. Symington boasted that Arizona had become &quot;the only state in the union to put it to the people,&quot; and felt the vote in approval of the holiday made &quot;a wonderful statement about Arizona.&quot;

One of the major achievements enacted by Symington as Governor came at the end of his first term. It included sweeping education reform legislation, which led to the establishment of charter schools in Arizona. The goal behind establishing charter schools was to improve student achievement and provide additional academic choices, with the first charters opening the following year in 1995. Symington later remarked that by creating charter schools &quot;the public education institutions would be forced to compete and get better, it was never meant to hurt, it was meant to make them better.&quot;

===1994 gubernatorial campaign===

Symington ran for reelection to a second term in 1994. In the Republican primary, Symington was challenged by Barbara Barrett, wife of business executive Craig Barrett. In regard to his primary campaign message, Symington stated &quot;I vowed to get state spending under control, reduce taxes and do my best to promote economic development and restore strength to the economy. I think I am in a strong position because I accomplished my goals.&quot; Barrett had spent more than $1 million of her own money in the attempt to defeat Symington, who she stated she did not dislike personally, but simply felt that she could do a better job as governor. On September 13, 1994, Symington defeated Barrett in the primary by a margin of 68% to 32%. Political analysts stated that Barrett had failed to distinguish herself from the incumbent governor, and ran a flawed campaign.

In the general election, Symington was challenged by Democratic nominee Eddie Basha, who was known in the state as a grocery store magnate as CEO and Chairman of Bashas&#x27;. Prior to the general election, Basha had led Symington in opinion polls by 15 to 20 points. However, the midterm elections of 1994 were a landslide for Republicans, which likely benefited Symington as well, despite his vulnerability due to the controversies that had emerged during his first term in office. Symington defeated Basha, winning 52% of the vote to Basha&#x27;s 44%. Basha had refused to resort to negative campaigning until the final days of the campaign when it was likely too late, which political analysts pointed to as the reason for his loss. In addition, Symington had highlighted Basha&#x27;s statement during a debate hosted by the League of Women Voters that the public school system &quot;can be the surrogate family to help children and parents,&quot; which led Symington to declare that Basha believed the &quot;state can take the place of the family.&quot; After defeating Basha, Symington, in his election night victory speech, pledged to try to further reduce state income taxes during the course of his second term, as well as continue to eliminate regulatory burden on businesses, and also to &quot;get tough on crime.&quot; Symington also declared his upset victory a &quot;miracle&quot; and a &quot;revolution,&quot; saying the people &quot;want their country back and they want their taxes lowered. Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan started all this and God bless them.&quot;

===Second term, conviction, and resignation (1995–1997)===
Shortly into his second term in office as governor, Symington filed for personal bankruptcy, claiming debts of more than $24 million, caused by the collapse of his real estate investments. According to a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Symington stated that his &quot;hand was forced by a consortium of union pension funds that refused to negotiate a settlement of an $11 million debt.&quot; To finance the construction of a shopping center and office complex in downtown Phoenix, known as the Mercado, Symington had been lent $10 million from six union pension funds. They foreclosed in 1991 when the Mercado&#x27;s disappointing revenue prevented Symington from being able to make payments towards the loan. This led to the court awarding the union pension funds an estimated $11.4 million settlement, which Symington stated was &quot;beyond his ability to pay.&quot;
In November 1995, Grand Canyon National Park was closed for the first time in its history, due to the federal government shutdown. On November 17, Symington&#x27;s response came very close to creating a national crisis. Citing the dire effects of the park&#x27;s closure on tourism, Symington stated that the &quot;Grand Canyon must remain open, by force, if necessary.&quot; The Pentagon warned the head of the Arizona National Guard against the use of force and raised the possibility that, if necessary, the guard would be federalized and brought under the control of the White House. The governor decided to go ahead and, accompanied by the Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, fifty unarmed National Guard troops, twenty-five state Park Department employees, and other officials, traveled to the canyon. When Symington&#x27;s group arrived, Symington beat on the park gates in front of the media and demanded that the park be reopened.

Robert Arnberger, the park&#x27;s superintendent delivered a letter to Symington from the United States Department of Interior which stated that the state of Arizona may be able to donate money to the department to reopen the Grand Canyon, which Symington called a &quot;political game.&quot; The Department of Interior later reopened the park under state supervision. A federal agency reimbursed Arizona the $370,020 the state donated to keep the Grand Canyon National Park open during the shutdown. The government shut down again in mid-December of that year, but the state and the federal government were able to come to an agreement to keep the park partially open, with the state of Arizona paying $17,625 in advance of each day&#x27;s operation, which was also later reimbursed by the federal government.

In 1996, Symington signed legislation establishing the Arizona Water Bank Authority as a separate agency. The agency acquires excess water from the Central Arizona Project and banks it in Arizona. In a news report published by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; in July 2016, historian Jack August wrote that the legislation &quot;left Arizona in a better position to deal with the current drought than neighboring California,&quot; which was experiencing challenges with drought and water management at the time of the article&#x27;s publication.

Later that same year, in June 1996, Symington was indicted on 21 federal counts of extortion, making false financial statements, and bank fraud. He was convicted for seven counts of bank fraud on September 4, 1997. He was charged with defrauding his lenders as a commercial real estate developer, extorting a pension fund and perjuring himself in a bankruptcy hearing. As Arizona, like most states, does not allow convicted felons to hold office, Symington resigned from office the next day. He was succeeded by then-Secretary of State Jane Dee Hull. Prior to his resignation, there had been a high-profile recall effort led by former Arizona Secretary of State Richard D. Mahoney. This conviction, however, was overturned in 1999 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Six days into jury deliberations, the trial judge had granted the government&#x27;s motion to dismiss a juror because the other jurors complained she was refusing to deliberate with them, a serious breach of the juror&#x27;s oath. A three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled 2–1 that there was a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that the juror had actually been removed because she was leaning toward acquittal, and the rest of the jury was frustrated at the prospect of a hung jury (in federal cases, verdicts must be unanimous). The appeals court held that the juror&#x27;s dismissal violated Symington&#x27;s right to a fair trial, since he was entitled to that juror&#x27;s vote. Before the government could retry him, Symington was pardoned in January 2001 by President Bill Clinton, terminating the federal government&#x27;s seven-year battle with the former governor.

==Post-governorship==
===Arizona Culinary Institute===

While free on appeal, and before receiving a presidential pardon, Symington had attempted to reinvent himself as a private citizen and decided to enroll himself in culinary school. Symington stated of his experience that &quot;It was very educational and very humbling.&quot; During his enrollment at the school, Symington had packed a bag of his belongings in case he had to report to Nellis Federal Prison in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 24 hours notice, but this was made moot following his pardon from President Clinton. After graduating from the Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts Scottsdale, Symington helped to found the Arizona Culinary Institute. The school was co-founded with several other business partners including chef Robert E. Wilson, entrepreneur Jerry Moyes and former president of the Scottsdale Culinary Institute Darren Leite. The vision of the school was to create a small class environment with hands on training, with a specific focus on the traditional French methods of cooking. The school was opened and started its first classes in early 2002 in Scottsdale.

In addition to his time as a student at culinary school, Symington returned to the Esplanade, a real estate development project that he started in 1983 and eventually lost in the investigation of his business practices, and began working as a dessert and pastry chef at an Italian restaurant at the facility. Symington opened the restaurant, called Franco&#x27;s Italian Caffe, in February 2003 with a business partner, restaurateur Franco Fazzuoli. Symington had previously interned at a restaurant that Fazzuoli owned while attending culinary school.

During an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Symington disclosed that he would rather be a chef than be &quot;making money,&quot; and that it was a &quot;great experience.&quot; Symington&#x27;s specialties included tiramisu, as well as a chocolate mousse recipe he created called &quot;The Governor (high taste, low taxes).&quot; Then-Governor Janet Napolitano had supposedly visited Franco&#x27;s Italian Caffe and finished her meal with &quot;The Governor&quot; dessert on multiple occasions, which was reported by the &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; to be the best-selling dessert at the restaurant. The recipe for &quot;The Governor&quot; included &quot;a layer of dense, flourless chocolate cake made with Callebaut dark chocolate from Belgium,&quot; and &quot;topped with chocolate mousse, then with another Callebaut chocolate cake with another layer of mousse.&quot; Finally, the entire dessert is &quot;drizzled with a chocolate ganache.&quot;

===Phoenix Lights===

In 2007, Symington revealed he was a witness to the Phoenix Lights, the mass UFO sighting that took place on March 13, 1997, when he was governor of Arizona, a decade before this admission. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Courier&quot;, Symington stated, &quot;I&#x27;m a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I&#x27;ve ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don&#x27;t know why people would ridicule it.&quot; He continued, &quot;It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn&#x27;t have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape.&quot; As Governor during the Phoenix Lights, Symington stated he would investigate the event, but went on to hold a press conference where he had his chief of staff dress up in an alien costume. He later stated that as a public official he had felt a responsibility to avert public panic and therefore made an attempt to introduce some levity into the situation.

On November 9, 2007, he appeared with a panel of guests discussing their UFO experiences on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. A few days later, on November 12, Symington acted as moderator for a UFO press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Other speakers included U.S. and foreign military witnesses and public officials involved in some major UFO cases, such as the 1980 Rendlesham Forest incident, 1990 Belgium UFO incident, and 1976 Tehran UFO incident, and heads of some official foreign government UFO investigations, such as Nick Pope in the United Kingdom and Claude Poher of France. They said the phenomenon was quite real, should be taken seriously, and urged the U.S. government to reopen its public UFO investigations. Symington also appeared as a witness of the Phoenix Lights in an updated version of the 2002 UFO documentary &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; by filmmaker James Fox. Prior to the documentary, Fox helped organize the witness panels for both &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, and the subsequent National Press Club event.

In 2017, Symington also wrote an editorial piece for CNN, where he further described his experience in witnessing the Phoenix Lights, saying that he observed a delta-shaped craft, which moved silently across the sky over Piestewa Peak (formerly known as Squaw Peak). He further described it as &quot;dramatically large&quot; with a &quot;very distinctive leading edge with some enormous lights.&quot; He also expressed his dissatisfaction with the Air Force&#x27;s explanation of the event as test flares, while acknowledging that there was a possibility of flares also being ignited that night, but that the Phoenix Lights were completely separate from those tests. He went on to voice his support for opening up further investigations, saying &quot;Investigations need to be re-opened, documents need to be unsealed and the idea of an open dialogue can no longer be shunned,&quot; and calling for the government to cease &quot;putting out stories that perpetuate the myth that all UFOs can be explained away in down-to-earth conventional terms.&quot;

===Potential return to politics and endorsements===
On February 4, 2005, in an interview with &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, Symington expressed interest in running again for governor in 2006 against Democrat Janet Napolitano. His interest in the race came after he attended Napolitano&#x27;s State of the State Address in 2005, and was galvanized in opposition to Napolitano&#x27;s education platform. However, three months later, on May 5, he withdrew his name from consideration, saying that he wanted to focus his energy on The Symington Group instead. In November 2006, Symington lost a bid to become the Republican Party Chairman of his local legislative district, the district also happened to be the home district of Senator John McCain, whose support Symington had received. This was the first electoral defeat of Symington&#x27;s career. In April 2007, Symington was named chairman of the board of trustees of the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden.

Following Janet Napolitano&#x27;s resignation as Governor of Arizona in 2009, due to her appointment as Secretary of Homeland Security, Symington was once more considered as a potential candidate to run in the 2010 gubernatorial election, but he again refused to run, announcing the decision in October 2009 following disappointing hypothetical poll numbers. Symington instead endorsed former Arizona Republican Party chairman John Munger, against incumbent governor Jan Brewer, but Munger eventually dropped out of the race when he was unable to compete with his fellow candidates&#x27; sizable fundraising and public funding of their campaigns. Despite Symington&#x27;s refusal to run again for public office, he has remained involved in state politics, endorsing candidates from both major parties, including Doug Ducey for governor, John McCain for U.S. Senate, and Democrats Ruben Gallego for U.S. Congress and Felecia Rotellini for Arizona Attorney General, among others.

Following the announcement by U.S. Senator Jeff Flake that he would not be seeking reelection to a second term, in October 2017, Symington became the treasurer of board of regents member Jay Heiler&#x27;s U.S. Senate exploratory committee, alongside former governor Jan Brewer as chairman. Heiler was Symington&#x27;s Chief of Staff during his two terms as governor. In January 2018, Heiler ultimately decided against running for U.S. Senate, instead supporting U.S. Congresswoman Martha McSally.

In October 2018, it was reported by &quot;The Arizona Capitol Times&quot; that Symington was contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate in the 2020 special election. The seat was vacated following the death of U.S. Senator John McCain, with former U.S. Senator Jon Kyl being appointed by Governor Doug Ducey to temporarily fill the seat. Upon appointment, Kyl stated that he would only serve in the Senate until the end of 2018 and in 2018 Governor Ducey appointed former Representative Martha McSally to the Senate seat. Symington stated that he would enjoy running against the potential Democratic candidate former attorney general of Arizona, Grant Woods, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t think of a better candidate to campaign against. We would have a lot of fun dishing it out,&quot; while also questioning Woods&#x27; party affiliation. Symington also refuted the idea of the legal issues that led to his resignation as Governor having an effect on his candidacy, adding &quot;Elections are about your ideas for the future, where you want to see the country go. It&#x27;s not settled on old issues, especially as distant as those.&quot; In September 2021, Symington became co-chair of Karrin Taylor Robson&#x27;s campaign for governor, alongside Jan Brewer.

===Later life and legacy===
In an op-ed published by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; in 2012, Symington took time to reflect on his time as Governor of Arizona, and spoke positively about his experiences, despite the federal government&#x27;s prosecution that led to his resignation. Symington wrote, &quot;Even as we were charging ahead to reform public policy in the brief time given any governor, I was visited by a ruthless pursuit from the world&#x27;s most inexhaustible adversary. Let it be recorded that few have fought the federal government and prevailed, but by grace and the love of family and friends, we did.&quot; In analyzing his performance as governor, Symington also stated in the retrospective, &quot;Arizona&#x27;s government operated comparatively well, without excess partisan rancor and without so many of the Republican peacocks and Democrat bantam roosters we see running around the political barnyard today.&quot; He also wrote that he believed Arizona would be &quot;better off&quot; had he been able to further reduce income taxes during his term, if not eliminate them, and also praised Arizona as the home of charter schools, an initiative which began under his tenure.

In July 2016, a discovery was made by Arizona historian Jack August when he located a large collection of missing documents regarding Symington&#x27;s governorship. There were 305 boxes total, which was estimated to take at least 500-man-hours to process, and consisted of policy papers, records from his federal trial, photos from White House visits, and a humorous photo of Symington in a Phoenix Suns gorilla costume. The records were located at a storage facility approximately four miles from the state Capitol building, and was described by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; as the &quot;equivalent of finding the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s gold.&quot; Prior to their unearthing, Symington had stated that he had no idea where the records were located, despite ordering his staff to box up the records for a swift transition in the event he was sentenced to prison. State law requires that public officials provide their records for public access, but enforcement of this law has been inconsistent and rarely imposed.

On February 9, 2017, an exhibit titled &quot;The Surreal Life of Fife Symington&quot; was opened at the Arizona Capitol Museum, with &quot;personal mementoes and a trove of family history items&quot; that were discovered by Symington, in a trunk belonging to his mother, serving as the centerpiece for the display. Political campaign materials, Symington&#x27;s Bronze Star from his service in the military, a cast bronze relief of Symington&#x27;s grandfather Henry Clay Frick, and yearbooks were also included. Secretary of State Michele Reagan officiated the opening ceremony. Jack August was one of the organizers of the exhibit, but died only a few weeks before its opening.

== Personal life ==
From his first wife Symington has two children and five grandchildren. His second wife was Ann Olin Pritzlaff, an ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church. They have three children and eight grandchildren. He is currently married for the third time.

<text>Etoricoxib, sold under the brand name Arcoxia, is a selective COX-2 inhibitor developed and commercialized by Merck. It is approved in 63 countries worldwide as of 2007, except the United States where the Food and Drug Administration sent a Non Approvable Letter to Merck and required them to provide additional data.

It was patented in 1996 and approved for medical use in 2002.

==Medical uses==
Etoricoxib is indicated for &quot;the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, and the pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis.&quot;

=== Efficacy ===
A Cochrane review assessed the benefits of single-dose etoricoxib in the reduction of acute post-operative pain in adults. Single-dose oral etoricoxib provides four times more pain relief post-operatively than placebo, with equivalent levels of adverse events. Etoricoxib given at a dose of 120 mg is as effective or even better than other analgesics that are commonly used.

== Adverse effects ==
Like all other NSAIDs, the COX-2 inhibitors too have their share of adverse effects. Fixed drug eruption and generalised erythema, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme like eruption and drug induced pretibial erythema are among the reported serious side effects.

==Mechanism of action==
Like any other selective COX-2 inhibitor (&quot;coxib&quot;), etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX-2). It has approximately 106-fold selectivity for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1. This reduces the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. The clinical relevance of the drug stems from the role of PGs in the inflammation cascade.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors show less activity on COX-1 compared to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). This reduced activity is the cause of reduced gastrointestinal side effects, as demonstrated in several large clinical trials performed with different coxibs.

==Cardiovascular safety and concerns==
Etoricoxib&#x27;s safety on the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular was evaluated in the MEDAL Program consisting of three clinical trials: MEDAL (Multinational Etoricoxib Versus Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term Study), EDGE (Etoricoxib versus Diclofenac Sodium Gastrointestinal Tolerability and Effectiveness) and EDGE II. Pooled analysis from these trials shows that etoricoxib has the same rates of thrombotic cardiovascular events as those of diclofenac, including thrombotic events (1.24 events per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 1.3 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac), arterial thrombotic events (1.05 events per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 1.10 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac) and risks of heart attack, stroke and death of vascular cause (0.84 per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 0.87 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac). Rates of upper gastrointestinal events (ulcer, bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) are in favor of the etoricoxib group (0.67 events per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 0.97 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac), but rates of complicated upper gastrointestinal events are similar between two groups.

Like rofecoxib&#x27;s VIGOR trial, the MEDAL Program was also criticized, this time due to Merck&#x27;s choice of comparator group. In a testimony before the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, Sidney M. Wolfe pointed out that unlike the VIGOR trial, in which the active comparator was naproxen, three trials in the MEDAL Program used diclofenac as an active comparator. Wolfe showed that when compared etoricoxib to naproxen, which is a nonselective COX inhibitor, etoricoxib significantly increases the risks of cardiovascular events to such a degree that &quot;are similar to rofecoxib/naproxen comparison&quot;, but when compared etoricoxib to diclofenac, which inhibits COX-2 more preferentially and has a worse CV safety profile than placebo, the difference was not statistically significant. He also noted the increase in other cardiac events, such as heart failure and high blood pressure.

<text>The Rhymney Valley () is one of the South Wales valleys, with the Rhymney River forming the border between the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. Between 1974 and 1996 a Rhymney Valley local government district also existed (one of six of Mid Glamorgan). The valley encompasses the villages of Abertysswg, Fochriw, Hengoed, Pontlottyn, Tir-Phil, New Tredegar, Nelson, Rhymney, and Llanbradach, and the towns of Bargoed, Caerphilly, Ystrad Mynach and Aberbargoed.

==Geography==

Created as a glacial valley, now the Rhymney River flows largely south to Rumney, a district of Cardiff. The river is the ancient boundary between Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.

Groesfaen, Deri, Pentwyn and Fochriw are located in the Darran Valley and not the Rhymney Valley. This valley joins the Rhymney Valley at Bargoed

Llanbradach is a large village in the Rhymney Valley between Ystrad Mynach and Caerphilly,

==History==
This valley is one of the South Wales Valleys, and its history largely follows theirs: sparsely populated until the nineteenth century; industrialised for iron, steel and coal; industrial decline in the 1980s and 1990s. The Rhymney Valley produced a miner poet, Idris Davies of Rhymney, famous for his poems associated with the locality and the struggles of its people.

The 1990s brought improved road connections to the valley—a dual carriageway running north from Caerphilly—increasing access to and from Cardiff and the M4 motorway, and increasing the numbers of commuters from the valley to Cardiff. The area is now one of the most populous in Wales.

The Rhymney Valley hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1990.

There is a legend to explain how coal first came to be found in the Rhymney Valley. It is said that the local fairies were being pestered by a giant. They asked help from an owl, who slew the giant. As the fairies burnt the giant&#x27;s body, the ground burned away, exposing the coal.

=== Gorsedd Stones ===

The Rhymney Valley Gorsedd Stones are located above Bryn Bach Park, Tredegar on the site of the 1990 National Eisteddfod of Wales hosted by the Rhymney Valley.

The stone circle consists of 12 standing stones arranged in a circle approximately 25m across with the tallest being 1.8m high a thirteenth stone marks the entrance to the circle. In the center is a flat stone known as the Logan stone. Stone circles of this type were erected on all sites of the National Eisteddfod until 2005 when as a cost-cutting exercise fibre-glass stone circles were used for the first time. 51°46&#x27;35.6&quot;N 3°16&#x27;46.1&quot;W

<text>Kelvinhall (&quot;Partick Cross&quot; until 1977) is an underground station on the Glasgow Subway, renamed after the nearby Kelvin Hall. It is located in the West End of Glasgow, Scotland, near to many of the city&#x27;s best known tourist destinations including:
*The Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
*Kelvingrove Park
*The University of Glasgow

There was previously a Kelvin Hall railway station, but it was unattached to the subway station, which was at any rate still known as Partick Cross at the time of that station&#x27;s closure in 1964 as part of the Beeching axe.

The station entrance is located off Dumbarton Road at the end of a narrow arcade of shops below flats. The station retains its original island platform layout and has no escalators. The renovation work at Kelvinhall station during the 1977–1980 modernisation of the Subway was not as extensive as most of the other stations on the network: other than Cessnock, it is the only station to retain its original entrance and surface buildings, which would be virtually invisible from the street without the signage.

Kelvinhall (under its former name of Partick Cross) is one of the stations mentioned in Cliff Hanley&#x27;s song &quot;The Glasgow Underground&quot;.

The Glasgow Subway is operated by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT).

==Transport links==
First Glasgow operated bus routes 2, 3, 8, 77, 90, M4 and N2 serve the station. Other bus routes that serve Kelvinhall are the riversider service 100, operated by Community Transport Glasgow, routes 189 and 190, operated by Hobson Travel and ARG Travel, and routes X25 and X25A, operated by Stagecoach West Scotland.

<doc id="1301987" wikidata="Q4994591" url="?curid=1301987" title="Mickleham, Surrey">
<text>Mickleham is a village in south east England, between the towns of Dorking and Leatherhead in Surrey. The civil parish covers and includes the hamlet of Fredley. The larger ecclesiastical parish includes the majority of the neighbouring village of Westhumble, from which Mickleham is separated by the River Mole.

==History==
Mickleham lies near to the old Roman road known as Stane Street, which ran from London to Chichester. It acquired its Old English based name in Anglo-Saxon times, when it was a small settlement lying within the Copthorne hundred.

Mickleham appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Michelham&quot; and &quot;Micleham&quot;. It was partly held by Nigel from the Bishop of Bayeux and partly by Oswald from (under) Richard de Tonbridge. Its domesday assets were: 7 hides; 1 church, 7 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 4 hogs. It rendered £10 per year to its overlords.

Nearby Mickleham Down was the venue for a single wicket cricket match in June 1730. The game was between two teams of three and played for a stake of £50. The teams, Surrey and Sussex, were described in a contemporary newspaper report as &quot;esteemed the best in the respective counties&quot; but it does not name the players. This is the first and only reference to Mickleham in association with cricket of a senior level.

Mickleham is mentioned in Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Emma&quot; (1815).

The philosopher and amateur botanist John Stuart Mill protested against the building of a railway though the &quot;beautiful valley of Mickleham&quot; in 1836. The village has featured prominently in cycling, following the loops of Box Hill adopted by various versions of the London-Surrey Cycle Classic which has acquired a federation of European cycling points status as an annual event, since its use in the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==Amenities==

===Places of worship===

The main place of worship is St. Michael&#x27;s Church, surrounded by St. Michael&#x27;s Churchyard. The church (in full the &quot;Parish Church of St. Michael and All Angels in Mickleham&quot;) has a Norman west tower and a Norman chancel arch, raised in the 1871 restoration by Ewan Christian, who added neo-Norman aisles and east end. The Norbury chapel on the north side is late Perpendicular, with chequerboard flint and clunch walling. The majority of the stained glass windows are by Clayton and Bell with others by Percy Bacon Bros, Morris &amp; Sons and a modern window by Alfred Fisher (2015).

===Community facilities and commerce===
The village has a Village Hall, two pubs (The Running Horses and The King William IV) and a restaurant (51 Degrees North).

===Schools===

In the village are Box Hill School, an independent secondary school, St Michael&#x27;s Infant C of E (Aided) School and St Michael&#x27;s Community Nursery.

===Transport===
;Roads
The A24 bypasses Mickleham with a dual-carriageway bypass.

;Railway
Box Hill &amp; Westhumble station, located across the A24, and towards Westhumble, provides a link to London and Horsham.
;Buses
The 465 bus route runs every hour or half-hour (except nights) between Kingston upon Thames and Dorking, via Mickleham village.

==Localities==

===Fredley===
The hamlet and former manor of Fredley is approximately 300m south of the centre of Mickleham. Juniper Hall, run by the Field Studies Council is located there.

James Clavell, the Australian novelist and screenwriter, lived at Fredley Manor between 1970 and 1990.

===Mickleham Downs===
The hillside to the east of the village, known as Mickleham Downs, was donated to the National Trust in January 1939 by Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor of the Daily Express newspaper, who had recently purchased the Cherkley Court estate.

===Norbury Park===
Across the Mole and the A24 is Norbury Park. In this is the &#x27;Druids Grove&#x27; which is an area of mature Yew trees.

===The Burford Bridge and the zig-zag road===
Here is the hotel that was frequented by Lord Nelson, 150m north of which starts the Zig-Zag road, one of the two local roads for motor vehicles climbing Box Hill.

== Landmarks ==

The surrounding area contains many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) including the Mickleham Downs and panoramic beauty spot of Box Hill.

The River Mole flows nearby. As its name suggests, the river in places goes underground due to the chalk bed being dissolved, forming swallow holes (sinkholes). Ian Middleton tells of his father, sometime in the 1950s, the village police officer P.C. Middleton, looking past his bathroom mirror one morning whilst shaving to see a mature oak tree disappear into the ground. It turned out that the river flowing underground had been gradually wearing away the supporting ground under the tree, forming a giant such hole which had collapsed. The subsequent pit was not filled in until about 1968 approx when it was still 30 ft deep and 30 ft across.

==Notable residents==
* Sir Carl Aarvold (1907–1991), Recorder of London (senior judge at the Old Bailey), who tried the Kray twins, and who played rugby for England and the British Lions 1928–1933, lived in Westhumble.
* Maurice Allom (1906–1995) England Test cricketer 1930–31, lived at Eastfield Cottage.

<doc id="1301990" wikidata="Q413744" url="?curid=1301990" title="Lumiracoxib">
<text>Lumiracoxib is a COX-2 selective inhibitor nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

Its structure is different from that of other COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib: lumiracoxib is an analogue of diclofenac (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid class of NSAIDs; it binds to a different site on the COX-2 enzyme than do other COX-2 inhibitors; it is the only acidic coxib and has the highest COX-2 selectivity of any NSAID.
It was patented in 1997 and approved for medical use in 2003. It was manufactured by Novartis and is still sold in few countries, including Mexico, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, under the trade name Prexige. Lumiracoxib has been withdrawn from the market in several countries, mostly due to its potential for causing liver failure (sometimes requiring liver transplantation). It has never been approved for use in the United States.

==History==
The TARGET study (Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial) was conducted with more than 18,000 patients to test its gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety against naproxen and ibuprofen and also study its efficacy against these two NSAIDs.

In November 2006, Prexige received marketing approval for all European Union countries through a common procedure called MRP. However, in August 2007, Prexige was withdrawn from the market in Australia following 8 serious liver adverse events, including 2 deaths and 2 liver transplants. On September 27, 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a not approvable letter for lumiracoxib, requiring additional safety data. Canada withdrew Prexige (approved at 100 mg dose only) in October 2007. Several European Union countries followed suit in November 2007.

The FDA rejected Prexige as a trade name for lumiracoxib in 2003. Prexede was suggested as an alternative, but the FDA Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support (DMETS) subsequently recommended against it as well.

===Withdrawal from market===
On August 11, 2007, Australia&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA, the national agency responsible for regulation of pharmaceuticals) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure.

According to the TGA&#x27;s Principal Medical Adviser, Dr Rohan Hammett, as of 10 August 2007 the TGA had received 8 reports of serious adverse liver reactions to the drug, including two deaths and two liver transplants.
&quot;The TGA and its expert advisory committee, the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC), have urgently investigated these reports. ADRAC has today recommended the cancellation of the registration of Lumiracoxib due to the severity of the reported side effects associated with this drug,&quot; Dr Hammett said.

&quot;The TGA has taken this advice to cancel the registration of Lumiracoxib in order to prevent further cases of severe liver damage.

&quot;It seems that the longer people are on the medicine, the greater the chance of liver injury. The TGA is, therefore, advising people to stop taking the Lumiracoxib immediately and to discuss alternative treatments with their doctor,&quot; Dr Hammett said.
New Zealand has followed suit with Australia in recalling Prexige.

On October 3, 2007, Health Canada requested sales of Prexige to stop. Novartis has agreed to the request and has taken steps to do so. On December 13, 2007, the European Medicines Agency recommended the withdrawal for Prexige from all EU markets.

On January 17, 2008, the Philippines Department of Health ordered Novartis Healthcare Phils. Inc. (Novartis) to remove (recall) all lumiracoxib from local drug stores in 2 weeks due to the harmful effects of the drug (potential serious liver-related side effects, hepatotoxicity or malfunction of the lungs).

On July 22, 2008, The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency ordered the withdrawal of 100 mg formulations of lumiracoxib and suspended marketing of the 400 mg formulation for 90 days, after a three-year safety review found a marked increase in adverse event reports; 35% of lumiracoxib-associated adverse events reported worldwide between July 2005 and April 2008 were found to have occurred in Brazil. Lumiracoxib was definitively withdrawn from the Brazilian market on October 3, 2008.

On November 12, 2008, INVIMA, the Colombian National Institute for Food and Drug Surveillance ordered the withdrawal of all presentations of lumiracoxib (Prexige), due to the international reports on hepatotoxicity.

<text>Llanelwedd () is a village and community near Builth Wells, in Powys, Wales. It lies within the historic boundaries of Radnorshire. Llanelwedd features the Royal Welsh Showground.

==Location and geography==

Llanelwedd is on the right bank of the Wye concentrated immediately north of Builth Wells. Here meet roads the A470 (from Rhayader), the A483 (from Llandrindod Wells and Welshpool), and the A481 (from Worcester). Being more populous, Builth dominates in the general perception of the area, and Llanelwedd&#x27;s main network of streets can be perceived as part of the town rather than its own village.

A station named after its neighbour, Builth Wells, was opened in the village on the former Mid-Wales Railway from Newtown to Brecon which ran through the village. This has since closed and nothing remains. The former site is used to access the fairground. The nearest mainline station is now Builth Road which is around two miles away.

The local stone is suitable for various uses, and the Llanelwedd Quarries dominate the landscape on the north-east side of the village.

The community includes the hamlets of Llanfaredd and Builth Road.

==Governance==
A Llanelwedd electoral ward exists, which includes the communities of Llanelwedd, Aberedw and Glascwm. At the 2011 Census this ward had a population of 1,206. Since 1999 the ward has elected a county councillor to Powys County Council.

==Features of the village==
Llanelwedd is the site of the Royal Welsh Showground, which hosts a number of attractions during the year as well as the show. It hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1993.

The village church is at the east end of the village, near the junction of the A481 and A483.

Llanelwedd has one Primary School - Llanelwedd Church in Wales School. This has 4 mixed age classes - Dosbarth Coch has nursery and reception, Dosbarth Gwyrdd has years 1 and 2, Dosbarth Melyn has years 3 and 4, whilst Dosbarth Glas has years 5 and 6.

<doc id="1301996" wikidata="Q582879" url="?curid=1301996" title="Auras, Uttar Pradesh">
<text>Auras is a town and nagar panchayat in Hasanganj tehsil of Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh, India. First officially classified as a town for the 1981 census, Auras is located just north of the Sai River, on the road from Unnao to Sandila. Other roads branch off to Mohan, Newalganj, and Malihabad.

Auras was historically the seat of a pargana and today is the seat of a community development block. Important commodities produced here include wheat flour, rice, and mangoes. As of 2011, the population of Auras is 6,466, in 1,158 households.

==History==
According to tradition, Auras was founded c. 1400 by Ram Mal, a member of the Ursaha merchant community from Sandila. The Ursahas&#x27; trade routes passed through the area, and the site of what is now Auras was covered by forests. Ram Mal cut down the forest and established a village here, which he called &quot;Auras&quot; after his tribe.

Auras was originally part of Lucknow district, but the Auras-Mohan pargana was moved into Unnao district in 1869. It was put into the tehsil previously based at Nawabganj; the headquarters were moved to Mohan at that point and then later moved to Hasanganj.

At the turn of the 20th century, Auras was described as a small village that served as headquarters of the pargana of Auras-Mohan. It had a police station, a road bungalow, and one primary school. There were two markets held weekly, but they were not particularly busy, and the only local products were earthenware and a small amount of jewellery. The population of Auras in 1901 was 1,535 people, including a Muslim population of 96.

==Geography==
The township is located near the Sai River at the Agra-Lucknow Expressway. The area is covered with evergreen vegetation and is having extremely fertile land for agriculture. The average elevation is 214 mts above sea level and is generally south-east sloping.

==Demographics==

According to the 2011 census, Auras has a population of 6,466 people, in 1,158 households. The town&#x27;s sex ratio is 920 females to every 1000 males; 3,368 of Auras&#x27;s residents are male (52%) and 3,098 are female (48%). The 0-6 age group makes up 14.9% of the town&#x27;s population; among this group, the sex ratio is 907, which is slightly higher than the district urban average of 903. Members of Scheduled Castes make up 31.26% of the town&#x27;s population, the highest proportion among towns in Unnao district, while no members of scheduled tribes were recorded. The town&#x27;s literacy rate was 69.0% (counting only people age 7 and up); literacy was higher among men and boys (77.3%) than among women and girls (60.1%). The corresponding gap of 17.3% was the highest among towns in the district.

In terms of employment, 26.4% of Auras residents were classified as main workers (i.e. people employed for at least 6 months per year) in 2011. Marginal workers (i.e. people employed for less than 6 months per year) made up 6.1%, and the remaining 67.6% were non-workers. Employment status varied according to gender, with 48.6% of men being either main or marginal workers, compared to 14.9% of women.

53.1% of Auras&#x27;s population lives in slum conditions as of 2011. There are 6 slum areas in Auras: Chamraudha 1st, Chamraudha 2nd, Khambhapar (the largest), Murauwan Tola, Pasiyana, and Thakurahana. These range in size from 85 to 183 households and have between 8 and 22 tap water access points. The number of flush toilets installed in people&#x27;s homes ranges from 15 to 65. All 6 areas are serviced by open sewers.

==Infrastructure==
The township is developed in sectors with some being north to Agra-Lucknow Expressway and some being south of it. The commercial and banking settlement is in north and the south has residential lands. The township is developed by LDA and KDA combined. The IT and knowledge park along with heavy machinery industry like Aero-Turbine and Casing Pumps that are set by Haliburton are creating jobs here.

== Villages ==
Auras CD block has the following 94 villages:

<text>Bad Dürkheim () is a spa town in the Rhine-Neckar urban agglomeration. It is the seat of the Bad Dürkheim district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, and the site of the discovery of the element caesium, in 1860.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Bad Dürkheim lies at the edge of Palatinate Forest on the German Wine Route some 30 km east of Kaiserslautern and just under 20 km west of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim. Roughly 15 km to the south lies Neustadt an der Weinstraße. In Bad Dürkheim, &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 37 and 271 cross each other. From west to east through the town flows the river Isenach.

=== Constituent communities ===
Bad Dürkheim&#x27;s &quot;Ortsteile&quot; are Grethen, Hardenburg, Hausen, Leistadt, Seebach and Ungstein including Pfeffingen.

=== Climate ===
Bad Dürkheim has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). Yearly precipitation in Bad Dürkheim is 574 mm, which is low, falling into the lowest quarter of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Lower figures recorded at only 16% of the German Weather Service&#x27;s weather stations. The driest month is February. The most rainfall comes in May. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in February. Precipitation varies little. Only 1% of the weather stations record lower seasonal swings. The warm climate allows the cultivation of mediterranean plants like the chinese windmill palm, stone pine, mediterranean cypress, fig tree, olive tree and oleander, which can be seen in many gardens and public spaces.

== History ==

Between 1200 and 500 BC, the area around the eastern end of the Isenach valley was settled by Celts, who also built the &quot;Heidenmauer&quot; (&quot;Heathen Wall&quot;), a Celtic ring wall.

The earliest documented appearance of the name of the town is in the Lorsch codex of 1 June 778, as &quot;Turnesheim&quot;. A letter of enfeoffment from the Bishop of Speyer in 946 mentions &quot;Thuringeheim&quot;. About 1025, building work on Limburg Abbey, today preserved only as ruins, was begun.

Town rights were granted on 1 January 1360, but were withdrawn again in 1471 after Elector Friedrich the Victorious of the Palatinate conquered the town and wrought considerable destruction. After the slow reconstruction, Dürkheim passed to the Counts of Leiningen in 1554.

In 1689, the town was almost completely destroyed when French troops in the Nine Years&#x27; War (the &quot;Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg&quot;, or War of the Palatine Succession) carried out a scorched earth campaign in the Electorate of the Palatinate. This time, though, reconstruction was swifter, and Count Johann Friedrich of Leiningen granted Dürkheim town rights again as early as 1700. In 1725, Dürkheim became the main seat of the Counts and later Princes of Leiningen, who resided in Schloss Dürkheim.

In the late 18th century, as the French Revolution was beginning to spread into southwest Germany, Dürkheim, as the Canton of Durkheim (without the umlaut), became part of the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). After the Napoleonic Wars, it ended up along with the rest of the Electorate of the Palatinate&#x27;s territory on the Rhine&#x27;s left bank in the Kingdom of Bavaria.

In 1860, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered the metallic element caesium in the mineral water from the Durkheim springs.

For its seven mineral springs, Dürkheim was given the epithet &quot;Solbad&quot; (&quot;brine bath&quot;), and in 1904 it was given leave to change its name to &quot;Bad Dürkheim&quot; (&quot;Bad&quot; is German for &quot;bath&quot;, and a place may only bear this epithet on state recognition of its status as a spa town). In 1913, the &quot;Rhein-Haardtbahn&quot; (a narrow-gauge tramway) was opened, linking Bad Dürkheim with Ludwigshafen and Mannheim.

In 1935, Grethen, Hausen and Seebach were amalgamated.

After 1933 the number of Jews in Bad Dürkheim reduced drastically, due to the economic boycott, constantly increasing repression and dehumanization (1933: 184, 1937: 98, 1938: 40). During the Night of Broken Glass in 1938, the synagogue was plundered. The 19 Jews still surviving here in 1940 were deported to the Gurs concentration camp in October of that year.

On 18 March 1945, Bad Dürkheim was badly hit by an Allied air raid in which more than 300 people died.

In Rhineland-Palatinate&#x27;s administrative reform, Hardenburg and Leistadt were amalgamated with Bad Dürkheim on 7 June 1969, as was Ungstein along with its outlying hamlet of Pfeffingen on 22 April 1972. Moreover, the town, having belonged to the old district of Neustadt an der Weinstraße, became the district seat of the newly formed district of Bad Dürkheim and also lay in the likewise newly formed &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Rheinhessen-Pfalz, which was later abolished in 2000.

In September 2023, 73.7 percent voted against renaming street names whose namesakes had a close connection and ideological proximity to National Socialism.

==Demographics==

===Religion===
In 2007, 52.8% of the inhabitants were Evangelical, 32.3% Catholic, and 14.8% stated no religion. The rest belonged to other faiths.

== Politics ==

=== Town council ===
The council is made up of 32 honorary members, who were most recently elected at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the full-time mayor as chairman.

The municipal election held on 25 May 2014 yielded the following results:
On the town council, the CDU, the FDP and the Greens form a coalition, making Bad Dürkheim the only town in Germany governed by a so-called Jamaica coalition. This special arrangement was concluded in 1999 after the SPD lost its majority. It has been twice extended by five years after municipal elections in 2004 and 2009.

=== Mayor ===
Wolfgang Lutz (CDU) was the Mayor of Bad Dürkheim from 2000 to 2015; he was re-elected on 6 May 2007 for a further eight years with 75.3% of the vote. His successor was Christoph Glogger (SPD), who was elected in July 2015 with 52.83% of the votes. He was succeeded by Natalie Bauernschmitt (CDU), elected in June 2023.

== Coat of arms ==
The German blazon reads: &quot;In Silber ein schwarzer Maueranker (Türangel).&quot; This might be rendered in English as: Argent, a wall brace (hinge) sable.

The arms go back to a court seal from 1405, which itself was a reference to the arms borne by the Lords of Dürkheim.

Between 1540 and 1776, the arms featured a cross and a crozier above the escutcheon, indicating Limburg Abbey&#x27;s ownership of the town.

== Culture and sightseeing==

=== Buildings ===


==== Limburg Abbey and Hardenburg ====
At the edge of the Palatinate Forest lie the once thriving Limburg Abbey’s ruins. In the 9th century, the Salian Dukes from Worms built a fortress on the &quot;Linthberg&quot; as their family seat. In the early 11th century, the fortress was converted into a monastery with a basilica. It existed until the mid-16th century.

Above the like-named constituent community are spread the castle ruins of Hardenburg. Beginning in the 13th century, the castle was the seat of the Counts of Leiningen, but was built in its current shape only in the 16th century. It was destroyed once and for all in the late 18th century.

==== Hunting lodges ====
In the town’s woodlands, nobles built the hunting lodges (&quot;Jagdschlösser&quot;) Kehrdichannichts (whose name means “Do-not-mind-anything”), Murrmirnichtviel (“Do-not-grumble-at-me-much”) and Schaudichnichtum (“Do-not-look-about”). While the first is still used today as a forester&#x27;s house, there is nothing but ruins left of the other two.

==== Churches ====
Saint Louis&#x27;s Catholic Parish Church (&quot;Ludwigskirche&quot;) was built in 1828 and 1829 in the Classicist style. The plans were inspired by a master builder from Baden named Weinbrenner. The building work was backed and financially supported by King Ludwig I of Bavaria (Bad Dürkheim was part of Bavaria&#x27;s Palatine exclave at the time).

The Protestant Castle Church (&quot;Schlosskirche&quot;) – formerly Saint John&#x27;s Church (&quot;Kirche St. Johannis&quot;) – was built in the late 13th century. Its tower, with a height of 70 m, is the Further (or “Anterior”, that is, East) Palatinate&#x27;s third tallest churchtower.

The Castle Church (&quot;Burgkirche&quot;) was built in the 18th century, destroyed in 1945 and thereafter built once again. Today it serves as a Protestant community centre. In its tower hangs a 317 kg bell poured in 1758. It underwent improvements in 2006 and is rung by a hand-drawn rope. It is rung each year at 14:00 on 18 March in memory of the air raid on Bad Dürkheim in 1945, and also at 17:00 on the first Saturday in Advent, together with the other bells in the inner town, to usher in the new liturgical year.

==== Ancient sites ====
The &quot;Heidenmauer&quot; (“Heathen Wall”) is the remnants of a great Celtic settlement with a 2.5 km-long ringwall, which was built about 500 BC.

The Roman quarry, Kriemhildenstuhl, was in use in the 4th century.

==== Modern sites ====
On the western edge of the Wurstmarkt grounds stands the &quot;Dürkheimer Riesenfass&quot; (&quot;Giant Barrel&quot;), the world&#x27;s biggest barrel. It houses a restaurant.

The &quot;Kurhaus&quot; (“spa house”) holds not only catering rooms and lounges but also the Dürkheim casino.

The graduation tower, known locally as &quot;Saline&quot;, is part of Bad Dürkheim&#x27;s spa facilities. With a length of some 330 m, it is one of the biggest of its kind in Germany. In the wake of a fire on 7 April 2007, in which great parts of the facility were destroyed, the outdoor inhalatorium has reopened as of June 2011. The opportunity is also being taken to modify the spa park.

=== Natural monuments ===
The foremost outing and hiking destinations in the Palatinate Forest are the Isenachweiher (a small reservoir) and the Drachenfels (despite its name, a hill), but especially, near the ruins of the Weilach estate, the Teufelsstein (&quot;Devil’s Rock&quot; – another hill) and the Heidenfels (&quot;Heathen Crag&quot;), as well as the Kupferfelsen (&quot;Copper Crags&quot;) near the former forester&#x27;s house Lindemannsruhe.

=== Regular events ===

==== &quot;Wurstmarkt&quot; ====
Above all, Bad Dürkheim is well known for the &quot;Dürkheimer Wurstmarkt&quot;, whose name literally means “sausage market”, although it is in fact the world&#x27;s biggest wine festival, drawing more than 600,000 visitors each year.

==== Literature prize ====
The town of Bad Dürkheim awards the &quot;Limburg-Preis&quot; for literature, named after the Abbey, every three years.

==== Giant roulette ====
Every year in August, the &quot;Riesenroulette&quot; – “Giant Roulette Wheel” – is set up in the spa park as part of the &quot;Kurparkgala&quot;. It is the world&#x27;s biggest roulette wheel and uses a ball the size of a football.

==== &quot;Stadtgeläute&quot; ====
The “Town Bellringing” is heard once a year at 17:00 on the first Saturday in Advent, and is performed by ringers at the town&#x27;s three churches, the &quot;Burgkirche&quot;, the &quot;Schlosskirche&quot; and the &quot;Ludwigskirche&quot;.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

Bad Dürkheim&#x27;s main industry is winegrowing. With 855 ha (3.3 square miles) of vineyards under cultivation, the town is the Palatinate’s third biggest winegrowing centre. In Rhineland-Palatinate as a whole, it ranks fourth. Nevertheless, tourism and health promotion play an important role. Some spa clinics have located in the town. Furthermore, Bad Dürkheim was one of the few places in Germany with a graduation tower that was still being run, until it all but burnt down in 2007. It was rebuilt in 2010. Among midsize businesses, the paper and wood industry is represented, along with various technology businesses.

=== Transport ===
Bad Dürkheim is linked to the long-distance road network by &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 37 (Kaiserslautern–Mosbach) and 271 (Neustadt–Monsheim). The four-lane Autobahn A 650 has still not been built quite as far as Bad Dürkheim.

The &quot;Rhein-Haardtbahn&quot; (a narrow-gauge tramway), which now runs as “Line 4”, runs through Maxdorf and links Bad Dürkheim with Ludwigshafen and Mannheim, where it joins with the Mannheim tramway network at Mannheim Hauptbahnhof and then continues to Heddesheim. On Sundays and holidays, the &quot;RNV-Express&quot; offers a through tramway connection with five two-car units running as far as Heidelberg; the &quot;RNV-Express&quot; does not stop everywhere and has no line number. The Pfälzische Nordbahn from Neustadt an der Weinstraße to Monsheim serves the town at a &quot;terminal&quot; station (although the right-of-way branches both ways after a short distance). The excursion train, the &quot;Elsass-Express&quot; (“Alsace Express”), also begins its run here, taking passengers all the way to the Alsatian town of Wissembourg just inside France.

Until 1981, there was also a gondola lift that whisked riders from the Wurstmarkt grounds to the Teufelsstein (“Devil’s Stone” – a mountain). Since 2005, the town has been preparing its reintroduction.

To Bad Dürkheim&#x27;s north-east lies a recreational airfield, the &quot;Flugplatz Bad Dürkheim&quot;.

=== Media ===
Local print media are the daily newspaper &quot;Die Rheinpfalz&quot; (with a local section for the Bad Dürkheim region) and the weekly &quot;Stadtanzeiger&quot;.

On cable television, the public-access channel &quot;Offener Kanal Neustadt und Weinstraße&quot; can be received.

==== Microwave transmission tower ====
The &quot;Richtfunkturm&quot;, a 72 m-tall steel-reinforced concrete mast, was formerly used by the military. The operational buildings stood in the outlying centre of Hardenburg. Today the tower is used for microwave transmission for the O2 and E+ cellular networks. Position: .

=== Public institutions ===
Bad Dürkheim, as the district seat, hosts the like-named district&#x27;s administration. It has at its disposal an &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; that belongs to the Landgerichtsbezirk of Frankenthal and to the Oberlandesgerichtsbezirk of Zweibrücken.

On 23 November 2008, the Palatinate&#x27;s first Protestant urn graveyard was consecrated in Bad Dürkheim&#x27;s outlying centre of Seebach. It is found right at the monastery church. The burials there are exclusively cinerary urns made of disintegrating unfired earth. Charged with the artistic design was the Landau sculptor Madeleine Dietz.

<text>TransMolecular was a biotech company located in Birmingham, Alabama. It was geared to finding anti-cancer targeted drugs.

TransMolecular, Inc. engaged in discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for glioma, metastatic brain tumors, and cancers. It developed TM601, a synthetically-produced polypeptide that was derived from scorpion venom, which is used to specifically target tumors in the treatment of cancer. The company was founded in 1996. In 2003, Fortune Magazine listed the company as one of the 14 &quot;most exciting, innovative companies in the nation&quot;.

In March 2011, TransMolecular&#x27;s assets were purchased by Morphotek, a subsidiary of the Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai.

<text>Exelixis, Inc. is a genomics-based drug discovery company located in Alameda, California, and the producer of Cometriq, a treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medullary thyroid cancer with clinical activity in several other types of metastatic cancer.

==History==

Exelixis was founded in 1994; the scientific founders were Spyridon Artavanis–Tsakonas, at Yale at that time, and Corey Goodman and Gerry Rubin who were then at the University of California, Berkeley. George Scangos joined the company as CEO in 1996. The business plan was to use model organisms (fruit flies, nematodes, and zebrafish) and functional genomics to identify pathways and biological targets that could be exploited in the fields of agriculture and medicine. It eventually set up a subsidiary, Exelixis Plant Sciences, for the agricultural work.

By 2000 it had left the radical exploratory phase behind and became focused on drug discovery and had a chemical library of 4 million compounds. The company went public that year, after withdrawing its offering the week before; it raised $118 million in a down market.

In 2002 the company signed a broad alliance with GSK to discover new drugs in the fields of cancer, inflammatory diseases, and vascular conditions; GSK paid it $30 million in cash, bought $14 million in stock at twice the market rate, and committed to providing Exelixis with $90 million in research funding; it also offered loan financing of up to $85 million.

By 2002 the company had limited its internal efforts to cancer, and had settled its strategy on discovering and developing drugs that could inhibit targeted small sets of tyrosine kinases that are needed for cancer formation, growth, and metastasis. The sets of TKs had been identified by means of its prior functional genomics work. This approach was controversial at the time; most companies try to selectively target just one protein in their discovery efforts.

In 2006 Exelixis partnered with Daiichi Sankyo on compounds that targeted mineralocorticoid receptors; esaxerenone was part of this collaboration. In 2007, the company partnered its MEK inhibitor program with Genentech; cobimetinib (at that time XL-518) was part of this collaboration. Exelixis had filed an IND on XL-518 prior to the partnership, committed to funding and running the Phase I trial, and retained rights to co-market it in the US.

In 2008 the company partnered its lead cancer drug candidate, XL-184 (which would become called cabozantinib) and another cancer candidate, XL-281, with Bristol Myers Squibb; BMS returned the rights to XL-184 to Exelixis in 2010 and returned the rights to other drug candidate in 2011.

In 2010 Scangos departed as CEO to take over at Biogen and the company appointed Michael M. Morrissey as president and CEO; Morrissey had joined the company in 2000 as Vice President of Discovery Research. At that time the company had eight drugs in clinical trials.

Exelixis&#x27; first drug approval came in 2012, when cabozantinib was approved for medullary thyroid cancer, an orphan indication. It was approved in Europe in 2014. 

Exelixis invested heavily in exploring cabozantinib in other cancers, betting the future of the company on the drug. In 2014 the drug failed a Phase III trial in prostate cancer, and the company laid off 70% of its employees.

In 2015 Genentech and Exelixis won FDA approval for cobimetinib for certain forms of melanoma.

In March 2016 Exelixis licensed to Ipsen worldwide rights (outside the US, Canada, and Japan) to market cabozantinib.

In April 2016 the FDA granted approval for marketing the tablet formulation as a second line treatment for kidney cancer and the same was approved in Europe in October of that year.

In December 2017, the FDA granted approval for the use of cabozantinib for first line treatment of kidney cancer and in May 2018 approval for first-line treatment was approved in Europe.

=== Pricing ===

==== Cabometyx (cabozantinib) ====
In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Cabometyx (cabozantinib) as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Cabometyx&#x27;s wholesale acquisition cost rose by 7.5%, leading to an additional $86 million in costs to U.S. payers.

<text>Meifod, formerly also written Meivod (), is a small village, community and electoral ward north-west of Welshpool in Montgomeryshire, Powys, Wales, on the A495 road and located in the valley of the River Vyrnwy. The River Banwy has a confluence with the Vyrnwy approximately to the west of the village. The village itself had a population of 317. The community includes the village of Bwlch-y-cibau and the hamlet of Allt-y-Main.

==History==
Although the Mediolanum of the Antonine Itinerary has since been identified as Whitchurch in Shropshire, Meifod is sometimes identified as the Mediolanum among the Ordovices described in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, although others argue for Llanfyllin or Caersws.

Meifod is about north-east of the royal residence of the Princes of Wales at Mathrafal, and it was an early Christian centre known at &quot;Caer Meguaidd&quot; or &quot;Meguaid&quot;; It is associated with St Gwyddfarch in the 6th century and St Tysilio in the 7th. Tysilio&#x27;s father was Brochwel Ysgithrog, a prince of Powys, who made Meifod his summer residence. The first Christian foundation was probably a clas and a monastery in the early medieval period. A church built by Madog ap Maredudd, the last prince of the entire Kingdom of Powys, and dedicated to St Fair, was consecrated in 1156. The same churchyard once contained three separate churches; Eglwys Gwydafarch, Eglwys Fair and Eglwys Tysilio.

The churchyard is said to contain the royal tombs of Madog ap Maredudd (d. 1160) and his son Gruffydd Maelor (d. 1191), Prince of Powys Fadog. There is also a stone slab in the church dated late-9th or early-10th century, although very weathered the decorations on it are still clear and include a large cross and a smaller cross in a circle, it is assumed that it once covered a tomb.

The village has never been served by a railway. However the Llanfyllin Branch line ran a few miles north east of the village and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway terminus is in the nearby town of Llanfair Caereinion.

The village lies in the floodplain of the River Vyrnwy and was flooded in 1955.

The Barony of Main-yn-Meifod belonged the House of Mathrafal through the members of the House of Powys, such as Iorwerth Goch, his son Iorwerth Vychan, and his grandson Madoc Vychan.

==Religion==

At the village centre is the Church of St Tysilio and St Mary which occupies a very large site; the building includes material with a wide range of ages some dated to the 12th century. In addition, in common with many Welsh villages, there are a number of Nonconformist chapels within the village and its catchment area.

==Buildings==
The village has one pub, the King&#x27;s Head and a convenience store (with a post office). In 2006, local rugby union team C.O.B.R.A built a new rugby clubhouse and two pitches. The village football team plays in the amateur division. The village also has a primary school, Ysgol Meifod (formerly Meifod County Primary (or CP) School) and a modern village hall located next door which provides facilities for a wide variety of clubs and societies.

Bryngwyn Hall, to the north, is a late 18th century country house designed by Robert Mylne. It is a Grade II* listed building and its Victorian park is listed, also at Grade II*, on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

Dyffryn Hall, a Georgian period manor house, is situated to the west of the village and was home to Clement Davies, the Montgomeryshire MP and leader of the post-war Liberal Party between 1945 and 1956.

==Demographics==
57% of the population of Meifod were born in England. However, this is not in itself evidence of any large-scale immigration from England; it may simply reflect the preference of local parents for using larger hospitals more conveniently situated in nearby Shropshire for giving birth. The United Kingdom Census 2001 revealed that some 38% of the population over 3 years old had some knowledge of the Welsh language, with almost 20% able to speak, read and write in Welsh. The Meifod valley hosted the National Eisteddfod in 2003 and 2015.

<text>Voorne-Putten () is an island between the North Sea, the Brielse Meer and the rivers Oude Maas, Spui and Haringvliet in the province of South Holland. Voorne-Putten consists of the two former islands Voorne (the larger, western part) and Putten (the smaller, eastern part). It used to be separated by the river Bernisse which silted up, uniting the two islands. It has 160,000 inhabitants (2008). Recently the riverbed has been dredged, and the two islands have been reformed.

The North Sea coast of Voorne is a valuable nature reserve (sand dunes), even though the northern part of the area has lost much of its estuarine character with the building of the Maasvlakte, an extension of the Port of Rotterdam, in the 1960s. The rest of the island is a mostly agricultural region. The largest town is Spijkenisse.
Voorne-Putten consists of the following municipalities:
* Voorne:
** Voorne aan Zee
** Nissewaard - Bernisse (Heenvliet, Abbenbroek, Oudenhoorn, and Zuidland)
* Putten:
** Nissewaard - Bernisse (Geervliet and Simonshaven) and Spijkenisse

Voorne-Putten is separated
*from the island of Rozenburg on the north by the Brielse Meer (dam and bridge)
*from IJsselmonde island on the north-east by the Oude Maas (bridge and metro tunnel)
*from Hoeksche Waard island on the south-east by the Spui (ferry)
*from Goeree-Overflakkee island on the south by Haringvliet (dam)

<doc id="1302032" wikidata="Q3987201" url="?curid=1302032" title="The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show">
<text>The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, sometimes called The Burns and Allen Show, is a half-hour television sitcom broadcast from 1950 to 1958 on CBS. It starred George Burns and Gracie Allen, one of the most enduring acts in entertainment history. Burns and Allen were headliners in vaudeville in the 1920s, and radio stars in the 1930s and 1940s. Their situation comedy TV series received Emmy Award nominations throughout its eight-year run.

==Production==

A half-hour TV series broadcast October 12, 1950 – September 22, 1958, on CBS, &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; was initially staged live and broadcast every other Thursday at 8 pm ET. In fall 1952, it became a weekly series filmed on the West Coast. From March 1953 through September 1958, &quot;The Burns and Allen Show&quot; aired Mondays at 8 pm ET.

The show was an immediate success. Six episodes were produced live from the Mansfield Theatre in New York, with the stage set as the Burns&#x27;s living room. The show relocated to the CBS Columbia Square facilities in Hollywood beginning with the seventh episode.

Ever the businessman, Burns realized it would be more efficient to do the series on film; the half-hour episodes could then be syndicated. From that point on, the show was filmed at General Service Studios without a live audience present; however, each installment was screened before an audience to provide live responses prior to the episodes being broadcast. With 291 episodes, the show had a long network run through 1958 and continued in syndicated reruns for years.

The sets were designed to look like the couple&#x27;s real-life residence. An establishing shot of the actual house on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills, California, was often used. Although extensively remodeled, that house still exists today—including the study over the garage where George would &quot;escape&quot; from Gracie&#x27;s illogical logic. Burns lived in the house until his death in 1996, at the age of 100.

One running gag of the TV show involved a closet full of hats belonging to various visitors to the Burns household, who would slip out the door unnoticed and leave their hats behind rather than face another round with Gracie. The format had George watching all the action (standing outside the proscenium arch in early live episodes; watching the show on TV in his study towards the end of the series) and breaking the fourth wall by commenting upon it to the viewers. Another running gag was George&#x27;s weekly &quot;firing&quot; of announcer Harry Von Zell after he turned up aiding, abetting, or otherwise not stopping the mayhem prompted by Gracie&#x27;s illogical logic.

During the course of the eight-year run, the TV show had remarkable consistency in its cast and crew. The episodes were produced and directed by Ralph Levy (1950–53); Frederick de Cordova, later producer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (1953–56); and Rod Amateau (1956–58). The original writing staff consisted of Sid Dorfman, Harvey Helm, Paul Henning, and William Burns (George&#x27;s brother). Later writers included Nate Monaster, Jesse Goldstein, Norman Paul, and Keith Fowler. The associate producer was Al Simon, the director of photography was Philip Tannura, A.S.C., and the editor was Larry Heath. The show&#x27;s primary sponsor was Carnation Evaporated Milk, later alternating with B.F. Goodrich (1952–55, 1956–57), and General Mills, for Betty Crocker (1955–56, 1957–58).

Bea Benaderet carried over from the &quot;Burns and Allen&quot; radio show, portraying neighbor Blanche Morton, but over the course of the series, four different actors played her husband. The character&#x27;s first name was &quot;Harry&quot;, the same first name as the real-life announcer Harry Von Zell, requiring the writers to craft dialogue that would distinguish the two characters&#x27; names. Blanche&#x27;s husband Harry Morton was first portrayed by Hal March (October–December 1950), then John Brown (January–June 1951), and after that, Fred Clark, until 1953 and Larry Keating until 1958. In one episode, &quot;Morton Buys Iron Deer/Gracie Thinks George Needs Glasses&quot;, George walks on-stage and freezes the scene just before Harry&#x27;s entrance and explains that Clark has left the show to perform on Broadway. He introduces Larry Keating, who enters, and then calls over Bea Benaderet to introduce the two saying, &quot;This is Larry Keating and he is going to be your husband now&quot;. The pair greet and chat briefly, complimenting each other on their previous work. George remarks that if they are going to be so nice to each other, no one will believe they are married. Burns then gives a cue, Blanche resumes her position, and the scene continues where it stopped as if nothing had happened. The new Harry enters and Blanche hits him in the head with a catalog for spending $200 to buy an iron deer.

Also appearing in the TV series were Burns and Allen&#x27;s two children. Ronnie, adopted in 1935, and Sandra, adopted the year before, first appeared in the third-season episode, &quot;Uncle Clyde Comes to Visit&quot; (January 1, 1953), playing themselves. The teenagers are in the Burns living room, threading a 16 mm projector with that night&#x27;s episode. In voiceover, George introduces them, and tells the audience that they have been away at school and that is why we have not met them before. Ronnie made a guest appearance on the episode &quot;Gracie Gives Wedding in Payment of a Favor&quot; (October 18, 1954), playing a character named Jim Goodwin, and was introduced to the audience at the episode&#x27;s conclusion. Ronnie joined the regular cast October 10, 1955, playing himself, but cast as a young drama student who tended to look askance at his parents&#x27; comedy style. Their daughter, Sandra, declined becoming a regular member of the cast, although she appeared in a few episodes as a classmate of Ronnie. In one episode, Ronnie&#x27;s drama class puts on a vaudeville show to raise funds for the school. Gracie hosts the show while Ronnie and Sandy deliver an impersonation of their famous parents along with one of their classic routines. Since Ronnie played himself, Gracie closed the segment with a wisecrack: &quot;The boy was produced by Burns and Allen.&quot;

Starting in the fall of 1955, Burns and Allen often reappeared after the end of the episode, before a curtain decorated with the names and locations of the various theaters where they headlined in their vaudeville days. They would perform one of their signature &quot;double routines&quot;, often discussing one of Gracie&#x27;s fictional relatives (including &quot;Death Valley Allen&quot; the prospector, &quot;Florence Allen&quot; the nurse, &quot;Casey Allen&quot; the railroad man). Burns always ended the show with, &quot;Say goodnight, Gracie&quot;, to which Allen simply replied, &quot;Goodnight.&quot; She never said, &quot;Goodnight, Gracie&quot;, as legend has it. Burns was once asked this question and said it would have been a funny line. Asked why he did not do it, Burns replied, &quot;Incredibly enough, no one ever thought of it.&quot;

In March 1953, &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; joined &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as part of the CBS Monday-night primetime lineup. As a result, the show entered the top 30 television programs in the Nielsen ratings ranking at number 20. For the 1954–1955 season, it ranked number 26, and for both the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons it was number 28.

With &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; ending its six-year run on CBS in the spring of 1957, the television network wanted to renew the Burns and Allen series, but by this time, Allen had grown tired of performing. Nevertheless, Burns committed both of them for another year, which would be their eighth—and last—on television.

Allen announced her retirement on February 17, 1958, to be effective at the end of the current season.

Burns and Allen filmed their last show on June 4, 1958. The filming was an emotional experience, although nothing was said about it being Allen&#x27;s last performance. At the wrap party, Allen took a token sip of champagne from a paper cup, hugged her friend and co-star Bea Benaderet, and said &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s it.&quot; After a brief last look around the set, she said, &quot;And thank you very much, everyone.&quot;

&quot;She deserved a rest,&quot; Burns said when Allen devoted herself to gardening and being a homemaker:She had been working all her life, and her lines were the toughest in the world to do. They didn&#x27;t make sense, so she had to memorize every word. It took a real actress. Every spare moment—in bed, under the hair dryer—had to be spent in learning lines. Do you wonder that she&#x27;s happy to be rid of it?

Burns attempted to continue the show with the same supporting cast but without Allen. &quot;The George Burns Show&quot; lasted one season (October 21, 1958 – April 14, 1959) on NBC.

Following a mild heart attack in the 1950s, Allen suffered a series of angina episodes over a number of years. She had a major heart attack in 1961. She lived a slower but comfortable retirement for another three years, often appearing in public with her husband, but never performing. Gracie Allen died August 27, 1964, as Burns was underway with his short-lived ABC sitcom, &quot;Wendy and Me&quot;, with Connie Stevens and a cast including Ron Harper, James T. Callahan, and J. Pat O&#x27;Malley. All the TV shows were produced under the banner of McCadden Productions, a company run by George Burns which he named after the street on which his brother William lived. McCadden also produced the iconic TV show &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. The McCadden catalog is now owned by Sony Pictures Television.

<text>== Karlheinz Essl ==

==Biography==
Essl was born in Vienna. His studies at the University of Music in Vienna included composition under Friedrich Cerha, electroacoustic music under Dieter Kaufmann, and double bass. At the University of Vienna he studied musicology and wrote his doctoral thesis on &quot;Das Synthese-Denken bei Anton Webern&quot; (1989).

From 1992 to 2016, he was the music curator of the Essl Collection in Klosterneuburg, near Vienna. Between 1995 and 2006, he taught algorithmic composition at the Studio for Advanced Music &amp; Media Technology for the Anton Bruckner Private University for Music, Drama, and Dance in Linz, Austria. As of 2007, Essl is professor of composition for electroacoustic and experimental music at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.

=== Early Life and Background ===

Essl&#x27;s formative years were marked by an early exposure to classical music theory, as well as an academic engagement with serialism and modern music technologies. His interest in blending traditional musical practices with new technologies led him to the field of electronic music, where he would develop a reputation for innovation and experimentation.

==Music==
Essl&#x27;s work with computers (with emphases on algorithmic composition and generative music) and prolonged occupation with the poetics of serial music have been formative influences on his compositional thinking. Besides writing instrumental music, Karlheinz Essl also works in the field of electronic music, creating interactive realtime compositions and sound installations.

Since the early 1990s, he has developed various software environments for realtime composition which he uses for his own live performances and also in collaboration with artists from other fields, including choreographers, dancers, visual artists, and poets). Essl has also carried out a number of Internet-based projects and became increasingly involved with improvisation.

Essl began developing a computer-based electronic instrument called m@ze°2 in 1998. He has used it to improvise during live performances. Since 2008, he is working on &quot;Sequitur&quot;, a series of compositions for various solo instruments and live electronics. He has recently written several solo and ensemble pieces for electric guitar.

==Reception==
While working on commission at IRCAM in Paris (1992–1993), he was composer-in-residence at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse für Neue Musik (1990–1994). In 1997, Essl was featured at the Salzburg Festival with portrait concerts and sound installations. In 2003, he was artist-in-residence of the festival musik aktuell, and in 2004 he was presented with a series of portrait concerts at the Brucknerhaus Linz. He was the 2008–2009 composer-in-residence of the Belgium ensemble Champ d&#x27;Action.

=== Algorithmic Composition and Generative Music ===

Essl has been a pioneer in the use of algorithmic composition and generative music. These approaches involve the use of algorithms, computer programs, or systems to generate musical structures, often in real-time, creating music that evolves according to predefined rules or randomly determined processes. Essl&#x27;s work in this area has greatly influenced contemporary trends in algorithmic composition, and he often integrates these processes into his live performances.

=== Interactive Real-Time Compositions and Sound Installations ===

In addition to composing instrumental and electronic music, Essl is known for creating interactive real-time compositions and sound installations. His works in this domain often involve the audience or environment in real-time, influencing the composition or sound output during the performance or installation. These works explore the intersection of sound, technology, and human interaction, allowing for a more immersive and dynamic experience.

=== Development of Software for Real-Time Composition ===

Since the early 1990s, Essl has developed a variety of software environments for real-time composition, which he uses in both his live performances and collaborations with artists from diverse fields. These software tools allow Essl to create music interactively, often in collaboration with dancers, choreographers, visual artists, and poets. His technical contributions have been instrumental in advancing live electronic music and expanding the possibilities of interactive composition.

For more information on the software developed by Essl, visit [his official website](http://www.essl.at/software.html).

=== M@ze°2 and Sequitur ===

Essl began developing a computer-based electronic instrument called m@ze°2 in 1998. This instrument, which he uses for improvisation, has become an integral part of his live performances, allowing for spontaneous creation and manipulation of sound in real-time.

In 2008, Essl began work on the Sequitur project, a series of compositions for various solo instruments combined with live electronics. These compositions have been central to his recent output and showcase his continued interest in the relationship between acoustic instruments and live electronic processing.

=== Recent Works and Collaborations ===

In recent years, Essl has written several solo and ensemble pieces for electric guitar, reflecting his ongoing interest in blending acoustic and electronic elements. His works often involve complex interactions between musicians and technology, emphasizing the role of improvisation and spontaneity.

Essl has also collaborated with various artists across disciplines, including choreographers, dancers, and visual artists, often creating interdisciplinary performances that merge music, dance, and visual art.

=== Influence and Legacy ===

Essl&#x27;s work has been a significant influence on the development of contemporary electronic music, especially in the fields of algorithmic composition, generative music, and interactive sound installations. His innovative approach to music technology and his contributions to real-time composition software have made him an important figure in the avant-garde music scene.

<text>Hershey&#x27;s Kisses are chocolates first produced by the Hershey Company in 1907. The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive conical shape, sometimes described as flat-bottomed teardrops. Hershey&#x27;s Kisses chocolates are wrapped in squares of lightweight aluminum foil. A narrow strip of paper, called a plume, protrudes from the top of each Hershey&#x27;s Kiss wrapper. Originally designed as a flag for the &quot;Hershey&#x27;s&quot; brand, the printed paper plumes were added to the Kisses product wrapper in 1921 to distinguish the Hershey&#x27;s Kiss from its competitors who were offering similar products.

== History ==
When first manufactured in 1907, Hershey&#x27;s Kisses were wrapped by hand. In 1921, a machine was used so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. This machinery also added the paper plume or paper strip flag to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify Hershey&#x27;s Kisses, replacing the original small square of printed tissue that was inside the foil wrapper.

In 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for &quot;foil wrapped conical configuration with plume&quot; which included the paper plume sticking out from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper. In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey&#x27;s Kisses foil wrapper.

During 1942, production of Hershey&#x27;s Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were re-purposed to create military chocolate D ration bars for the soldiers in World War II. By the end of World War II, Hershey&#x27;s had produced more than three billion D ration chocolate bars.

==Popularity==
Kisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the fifth-most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 70 million Hershey&#x27;s Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company&#x27;s two factories. Today&#x27;s Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey&#x27;s original milk chocolate formula.

==Kisses brand varieties==
Though originally made of solely milk chocolate, many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced. Hershey introduces and discontinues new Kisses flavors constantly as part of its standard Kisses offering, including holidays. In addition to the standard milk chocolate, year-round varieties include caramel, Special Dark, hazelnut (deluxe), birthday cake, cookies&#x27;n&#x27;cream, milk chocolate almond, and white chocolate (Hugs). Seasonal varieties include cherry cordial, hot cocoa, mint truffle, sugar cookie, candy cane, lava cake, &quot;vampire&quot; milk chocolate with strawberry creme and Kisses Special Selections milk chocolate with strawberry creme, truffle creme, yogurt, and mocha cream.

== Discontinued and limited-edition Kisses ==

Throughout the years, Hershey&#x27;s has created many different flavors of kisses, most of which are currently discontinued. The following list, updated in December 2021, is not necessarily exhaustive.

===Hershey&#x27;s Kissables===
Introduced in late 2005, these mini candy-coated milk chocolate kisses were similar to M&amp;Ms and Reese&#x27;s Pieces. Colors included red, orange, yellow, green, and blue, as well as pastels for Easter, pink, red, and white for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and red, purple, and brown Special Dark Kissables. In 2008, Hershey&#x27;s attempted to cut production costs by changing the recipe for these (and other chocolates), opting to use vegetable oils instead of cocoa butter. Customers were not pleased and this change ultimately led to the death of Kissables in July 2009.

===Candy Corn Kisses===
These candy corn limited edition Halloween kisses were introduced in 2007, and had three layers of white chocolate flavored candy; yellow on bottom, orange in the middle, and a white tip. Discontinued in 2011, Hershey&#x27;s opted not to bring them back for future Halloween&#x27;s due to poor sales.

===Strawberry Ice Cream Cone Kisses===
This limited edition flavor was only available for a few months around Easter 2021. Strawberry Ice Cream Cone kisses were available for purchase as of July 2022 at Hershey&#x27;s Chocolate World.

===Pumpkin Spice Kisses===
Released in fall of 2008, shortly following Hershey&#x27;s Kiss 100th anniversary, this limited edition candy was well received by the public. The kisses had a pumpkin spice scent; comparable to that of snickerdoodles or ginger snaps. The orange kiss was filled with a white pumpkin-flavored creme, and wrapped in a special gold and brown foil wrapper.

==Wrapper history and varieties==

When introduced in 1907, Hershey&#x27;s Kisses chocolates originally were wrapped by hand. The automated wrapping machinery was introduced in 1921.

The original wrapper was silver-colored foil and Hershey&#x27;s Kisses were only available in this single color for decades. In 1962, Hershey became one of the first companies to change its wrappers for seasonal sales. That was the first year that Kisses chocolates were available in different colored foil wrappers: red, green, and silver-wrapped candies were manufactured to coincide with the Christmas season. This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi&#x27;s &quot;Gifts in Good Taste&quot;—a mail-order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi&#x27;s Christmas catalog.

In 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for Easter, and in 1986, Valentine&#x27;s Day-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine&#x27;s Day. &quot;Fall Harvest&quot; colors were introduced in 1991. Independence Day has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with &quot;ribbons&quot; on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper. The Halloween themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a candy corn with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy.

In 2016, four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read &quot;Fa La La&quot;, and &quot;Kissmas&quot; Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.

==Paper plume==
All Kisses wrappers have a food safe paper strip called a plume as an identification tag sticking from the top of the foil wrapper. When the paper plume was added to the Kisses wrapper in 1921, originally it was a flag for the &quot;Hershey&#x27;s&quot; brand, distinguishing Hershey&#x27;s Kisses from its competitors.
==Advertising==
&quot;Christmas Bells&quot; is a long-running commercial in which Hershey&#x27;s Kisses, fashioned as a handbell choir, perform the Christmas carol &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;. The advertisement premiered in 1989 and has run each holiday season since in the United States, representing the longest-running television commercial for the Hershey brand. In 2020, Hershey&#x27;s introduced a new &quot;Bells to Blossoms&quot; version of the ad, in which one of the candies is removed from the choir and used to make cookies, but was criticized for changing a 30-year running iconic holiday tradition. The company made the decision to air both the &quot;classic&quot; and newer versions of the holiday ad throughout the holiday season.

==Ingredients and nutrition information==
Beginning with its own consumer research into product information, in 2015 Hershey led the SmartLabel initiative. Hershey&#x27;s was the first brand to adopt this Grocery Manufacturers Association mobile-scannable packaging standard. 
Kisses ingredients are cane sugar, milk, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk fat, lecithin, and natural flavor. A 1.45-ounce (41.1 g) serving of Hershey&#x27;s Kisses consists of seven Kisses pieces. Kisses has the following nutrition information:

<doc id="1302068" wikidata="Q377915" url="?curid=1302068" title="Agip">
<text>Agip S.p.A., acronym for Azienda generale italiana petroli, was an Italian automotive gasoline, diesel, LPG, lubricants, fuel oil, and bitumen retailer established in 1926 and subsidiary of Eni S.p.A.

In 2013 Agip merged into Eni, creating the Refining and Marketing Division (R&amp;M).

==History==

In 1924, Sinclair Oil, a U.S. oil company, and the Italian Ministry of National Economy created a fifty-year joint venture agreement to explore oil in Emilia-Romagna and Sicily, over an area of 40,000 km2. 40% of the capital was held by the ministry, all expenditure was incurred by Sinclair Oil and 25% of profits went to the Italian ministry. The political opposition, headed by Giacomo Matteotti and Don Sturzo, alleged that the joint venture was damaging to the nation and started a controversy which led to suspicions of corruption; Matteotti indeed was killed two days before he was due to give a speech on this issue. Don Sturzo continued the controversy, stating that a public company was the only way to maintain national energy independence.

Coal in Italy was scarce and of poor quality. It was imported from abroad at prices that weighed on Italy’s trade balance and limited industrial growth. Power plants, which were not very developed and mainly concentrated in the north of the country, could not satisfy the needs of energy.

===The constitution of the company and the &quot;ad aziendam&quot; laws===
With a royal decree on April 3, 1926, the government of the Kingdom of Italy established the &quot;Azienda generale italiana petroli&quot; (&quot;Agip&quot;), a joint-stock company, to conduct all activities relating to the petroleum industry. 60 percent of the share capital was held by the Ministry of the Treasury, 20% by Istituto Nazionale Assicurazioni (INA), and the remaining 20% by the Italian Social Insurance fund. The first president was Ettore Conti, a contractor in the electricity sector. The establishment of the company was attributed by many analysts to Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata, Ministry of Finance, and Giuseppe Belluzzo, Ministry for the National Economy. Volpi di Misurata, however, was directly involved in oil-related interests, working together with FIAT of Giovanni Agnelli, and with the financial backing of Banca Commerciale Italiana, which had searched unsuccessfully for oil in Emilia-Romagna.
In 1927 a &quot;Mining Act&quot; was enacted, which gave the ownership of the subsoil to the State and imposed the rule that any oil-related activity was subject to government authorization and/or grant.

Agip experienced difficulties after the crisis of 1929 but began to flourish in the 1930s. In 1933 a new law was issued that restrained protectionist refineries and Agip could operate with greater ease in this area.

===Early stages and development===

Agip had a facility for refining at Fiume and in 1936 it took over a refinery at Porto Marghera, owned by Volpi di Misurata. Soon after it made an agreement with Montecatini to create a joint enterprise, Anic (Fuel Hydrogenation National Company), which was to pursue the derivation of fuel by hydrogenation of brown coal. Anic built two refineries to process the oil extracted in Albania from Azienda Italiana Petroli Albanesi (AIPA), a subsidiary of Agip. However, the Albanian oil was of poor quality and its processing proved uneconomical.

Simultaneously, however, because of the costs to support colonial campaigns, Agip had to exit some foreign investments, in particular their exploration campaigns in Iraq. It was the explorer Ardito Desio who found oil in Libya and in 1939 came the so-called &quot;Petrolibia operation&quot;, in which Agip was linked to FIAT, with which the year before it had created an Italian company for synthetic fuels, to explore the possibility of obtaining gasoline from synthetic chemistry.

<doc id="1302075" wikidata="Q10711" url="?curid=1302075" title="Manuel Almunia">
<text>Manuel Almunia Rivero (born 19 May 1977) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. 

He competed mainly in the Spanish lower leagues in his early years, only appearing in 26 La Liga games over the course of two seasons with Recreativo and Albacete, after starting out at Osasuna. Most of his career was spent with Arsenal, for whom he signed in 2004, going on to play 175 official matches and winning the 2005 FA Cup. He also had a short loan spell at West Ham United.

In 2012, after his contract expired, Almunia joined Watford and played there for two years, following which he retired on medical advice.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Almunia started his senior career with CA Osasuna&#x27;s reserves in 1995, going on to spend four seasons with the team in the Segunda División B. Subsequently, he stayed in the same level, where he represented FC Cartagonova and CE Sabadell FC.

In the summer of 2001, Almunia first reached La Liga, after signing with RC Celta de Vigo. He never represented the club officially, however, being loaned to SD Eibar (where he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in the Segunda División for the 2001–02 campaign), Recreativo de Huelva and Albacete Balompié, the last two in the top flight.

Playing understudy to José Antonio Luque and César at &quot;Recre&quot;, Almunia&#x27;s debut in the Spanish top tier came on 17 November 2002, following a red card to the latter in a 3–0 away loss against Deportivo Alavés. It was one of only two league appearances during the season, as the Andalusians suffered relegation after ranking 18th.

At Albacete Balompié, Almunia started as backup to Carlos Roa. However, after the Argentine came down with illness he became first-choice, going on to help his team easily escape relegation through a 14th-place finish; his first league appearance was on 9 November 2003, in a 1–0 home defeat to Málaga CF as Roa was suspended.

===Arsenal===
Almunia joined Arsenal on 14 July 2004 for an undisclosed sum, to provide backup to Jens Lehmann. He made his debut for his new team on 27 October in a 2–1 win at Manchester City in that season&#x27;s League Cup, and his maiden Premier League appearance came on 4 December against Birmingham City; the highlight of his first year came in the fifth round of the FA Cup, a replay at Sheffield United: with the game finishing 0–0 after extra time and heading to penalties, he saved Alan Quinn and Jon Harley&#x27;s attempts to book his team a place in the quarter-finals, and was an unused substitute in the final win over Manchester United.

In the 2005–06 campaign, Almunia continued as second-choice to Lehmann, but found himself thrust into the spotlight when he replaced Robert Pires in the 20th minute of the final of the UEFA Champions League against FC Barcelona after Lehmann was sent off. He performed well for the most part, only conceding both goals in the 2–1 loss late in the game.

2006–07 brought Almunia 14 appearances in all competitions. This included the League Cup final, lost to Chelsea. He and Lehmann were by all accounts rivals off the pitch as well. In an interview with German television in October 2007, speaking about manager Arsène Wenger&#x27;s decision to drop him in favour of the Spaniard, Lehmann said: &quot;It’s possible that some day I’ll feel like talking about the whole issue. But at the moment I’m just swallowing it all as part of the humiliation. But I think – and this is aimed at my dear manager – one shouldn’t humiliate players for too long. I won’t just fade away quietly. Almunia has not yet showed he can win matches for us. I’ve experienced this before and know what the others are expecting from the goalkeeper&quot;. Five months later, Almunia responded: &quot;I treat people the way I would like to be treated myself. To have someone here who hates me is just amazing. Every morning I wake up I know it is going to be the same. But I don’t care any more. I come into training and work with Łukasz Fabiański and Vito Mannone. They are better than him anyway&quot;.

Almunia finally won the battle for first-choice duties in the 2007–08 season. Highlights included saving a penalty from Robbie Keane to help Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–1. He was given the number one shirt after Lehmann left for VfB Stuttgart at the beginning of the 2008–09 campaign, and he saved another important penalty on 21 March 2009, this time from Newcastle United&#x27;s Obafemi Martins in a 3–1 victory. In June 2008 he signed a new four-year contract with the English club, but his subsequent performances were highly inconsistent, with brilliant displays in the Champions League semi-final first leg against Manchester United and the 2010 Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona, and poorly received ones which resulted in rumours arising that he would be sold.
Despite the speculation, Almunia began 2010–11 as starter. However, on 25 September against West Bromwich Albion, he conceded a penalty (which he saved), let a weak shot slip through the near post and was caught out of position in the opposition&#x27;s third goal; he lost his place through injury and, upon his return, found himself third-choice behind the Polish duo of Fabiański and Wojciech Szczęsny.

Almunia made a return to the team on 30 January 2011 against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup, and went on to play both games in the next round against Leyton Orient. On 8 March, he came on as a 19th-minute substitute for the injured Szczęsny against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16 stage, and made a series of saves as Arsenal lost 3–1 at the Camp Nou to exit the tournament, 4–3 on aggregate; he was voted Player of the match by fans on the club&#x27;s official website.

With Szczęsny (dislocated finger), Fabianski (shoulder) and Mannone all out with injury, Almunia again became first-choice. On 19 March, during a 2–2 draw at West Bromwich, he was caught out of position along with Sébastien Squillaci, gifting the home team their second goal; already with Lehmann back in the club as an emergency signing, he injured his knee during warm-up of the fixture against Blackpool, and did not appear in any more matches for the rest of the season.

On 30 September 2011, Almunia signed an initial one-month emergency loan deal with Championship club West Ham United after Robert Green was ruled out for six weeks with a knee cartilage injury. He made his debut for the Hammers on 1 October in a 2–2 away draw against Crystal Palace but, at the end of October and with Green&#x27;s return to fitness, he returned to Arsenal.

On 22 May 2012, Arsenal announced that Almunia and six other players would be released from their contracts as of 30 June.

===Watford===
In July 2012, aged 35, Almunia signed a one-year contract with Championship&#x27;s Watford, replacing Scott Loach who had moved to Ipswich Town. He played his first game on 11 August in a League Cup tie at home to Wycombe Wanderers, and kept a clean sheet.

Having appeared in all thirty four of Watford&#x27;s league games, Almunia injured his hamstring against Derby County on 23 February 2013. He missed the next six contests as youngster Jonathan Bond deputised in his absence, returning in a 0–0 home draw against Cardiff City on 6 April 2013.

On 12 May 2013, in the play-off semi-final second leg at home to Leicester City, Almunia made a double save from Anthony Knockaert&#x27;s penalty in injury time, with Watford leading 2–1 but still level on aggregate. Watford counter-attacked from the resulting saves and Troy Deeney&#x27;s goal to put his team in the decisive match against Crystal Palace, where a Kevin Phillips penalty in extra time resulted in a 1–0 loss.

Watford announced that Almunia had signed a new twelve-month deal on 5 July 2013, to keep him at the club for one further season. Manager Gianfranco Zola commented: &quot;His experience and influence are so important for us and the impact he had at Watford last season was magnificent.&quot; He left in June of the following year, as his link expired.

Almunia retired on 28 August 2014 on medical advice, after a rare heart condition was picked up during a medical with Serie A side Cagliari Calcio. In 2016, he was appointed to the role of goalkeeping coach at UAE Pro League club Al Jazira Club.

==International career==
Almunia did not represent Spain at any level. He stated on more than one occasion his desire to play for England, only provided that he did not receive a call-up from his nation of birth first.

==Personal life==
Almunia, whose brother served in the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations in Kosovo, has an interest in the Second World War and regularly visited sites associated with the conflict before European games with Arsenal.

<text>Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags is a play written in 1829 by John Augustus Stone. It was first performed December 15, 1829, at the Park Theater in New York City, starring Edwin Forrest.

== History ==
On November 28, 1828, a contest was posted in the New York Critic by American actor Edwin Forrest offering a prize of 500 dollars for an original play which met such criteria as, “a tragedy, in five acts, of which the hero, or principal character, shall be an aboriginal of this country&quot;. Forrest, looking to produce a play suiting his strengths, created the contest as an opportunity to boost his acting career. With his play, &quot;Metamora, or the Last of the Wampanoags&quot;, playwright and actor John Augustus Stone stood out among his competitors and took home the prize. The play, which opened on December 15, 1829, was an instant hit. Due to a combination of the highly publicized contest, Forrest&#x27;s growing celebrity, and the timely subject matter of the play itself, the performances resonated with audiences across the growing country, earning theaters record profits, of which Stone received very little. Although Stone had written many other plays &quot;Metamora&quot; was by far the most critically acclaimed. After its debut the play quickly spread into various cities where it was continuously performed. During the 19th century there were over seventy-five Indian Dramas written, and even though &quot;Metamora&quot; shared a very similar plot line as the rest of plays, it was the only one to be successful.

== John Augustus Stone==
John Augustus Stone was born in Concord, Massachusetts on December 15, 1800. He started his theatrical career as an actor in his early 20s, portraying mostly comic roles, and was considered a crowd favorite in the New York Theatres. Later on, he married an actress and together they had two sons who became actors as well. Again, while Stone was respected and known for the play, the name associated with Metamora was Edwin Forrest — in fact Stone&#x27;s name is not on one surviving poster. Stone struggled with poor health issues and at the age of thirty-three committed suicide by jumping off the Spruce Street landing on June 1, 1834. Forrest was extremely grateful to Stone not only for his friendship, but for the role that changed his life, as well as his career. When Stone died, Forrest placed a monument on his grave that said, “To the Memory of John Augustus Stone, Author of Metamora, by His Friend Edwin Forrest.&quot;

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Metamora&quot; is set in 17th century New England around the arrival of the Puritans. The story deals with the conflict between the New English settlers, specifically Walter and Oceana, and the Wampanoags, specifically Metamora and his wife, Nehmeokee. Metamora is a tragic, noble Indian hero turned violent only by force. In the beginning there is actually peace, and a willingness to collaborate between the Wampanoags and the Puritans, however, as the play progresses, so does the rising conflict that leads to the full-on attack on Metamora&#x27;s tribe. During the ending scene, Stone provides the long-awaited marriage between Walter and Oceana. However, in the last moment, Metamora kills his wife in order to protect her from the New English settlers’ invasion, leaving the audience with the image of Metamora, his wife, and his son all slain as a result of the white man. He cursed the English with his final breath.

== Themes and criticism ==
Though &quot;Metamora&quot; is referred to as an Indian tragedy, its themes of love, war, dramatic deaths and suicides, and declaratory speeches make the play better described as a romantic melodrama. The depiction of Metamora as a kind and “noble savage,” turned violent by force especially resonated with the mid-19th century audience. Most critics raved over the play, however, some critical response was negative, and as one critic very harshly put it, “Mr. Stone did what he could to atone for the injury which he had inflicted upon the world by the production of this play. He drowned himself. We will accept the presumptive apology.”

== American character types: the Indian ==
In the years following such pivotal events in history as the American Revolution and the War of 1812, a strong feeling of nationalism infiltrated early America. This sense of national pride influenced not only everyday life, but also became evident in the arts, including early American theatre. After a time when mostly British theatre was performed in America, a desire to create drama specific to America emerged. America needed to establish itself in the midst of the well-developed drama and literature of other nations, as well as set a standard for what is uniquely American. However, this need for nationalism soon manifested itself in drama through American character types: the Negro, the Yankee, and in the case of &quot;Metamora&quot;, the Indian. As historian Walter Meserve points out, “American literature became identifiable only after writers had recognized the potential of American scenery, custom, characters, and ideas... in a sense, they were bound together by a similar desire for freedom: the Yankee from the English, the Indian from the Yankees, and the Negro from bondage.” Depictions of oppressed, underdog characters such as the Yankee, Negro, and Indian overcoming captivity, or dying gloriously, represented the themes of freedom and liberty that characterized the newly independent America.

== Indian drama ==
In the nineteenth century, about seventy-five Indian-related plays were written. The success of &quot;Metamora&quot; was due to Stone&#x27;s ability to create a lead character that was a combination of the sublime, the grotesque, and the natural state in order to produce a believable and gratifying story. Not only did he create a character that the audience could believe, but that the audience could sympathize with. The first American play with an Indian hero was a closet drama from 1776, marking the beginning of what would become one of the biggest trends of the century. The character Metamora was inspired by New England Chief, Metacom or King Philip, who was famous for attacking the English in 1675–1676. In 1671 the English settlers grew suspicious of Metacom and demanded that the tribe surrender their guns. Finally in 1675 when three Wampanoag&#x27;s were tried and executed for the murder of another Native American, who had been acting as an informer for the settlers, Metacom led a bloody uprising. This marked the last major attempt by the Indians to drive out the New England Settlers. It lasted for fourteen months and twelve frontier towns were destroyed as a result. The war came to an end in August 1676 when Metacom was captured and executed. Though King Philip&#x27;s War has been ignored by the modern public, it “stands as perhaps the most devastating war in this country’s history.&quot;

== Metamora and the Indian Removal Act ==
Opening only one year before the passage of Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act, &quot;Metamora&quot;’s depiction of a scorned and violent savage against English settler victims raises questions about the motives of both Forrest and Stone. In an essay analyzing the issue, Scott Martin remarks, “Recent interpretations insist that Stone’s play and Forrest’s personation of the title character, coming as they did when the fate of the southeastern tribes emerged as an urgent issue in congressional debate and the public mind, represented more than a mere coincidence in the realm of popular culture.&quot; Mark Mallett argues that Forrest&#x27;s partiality to the Democratic Party, and to Jackson, was the driving force behind &quot;Metamora&quot;. “Forrest’s play,” he asserts, “brought the Democrat’s message back into the theatre... effectively distracting public attention from the horrors of the government’s Indian Removal campaign.” However, others contend that &quot;Metamora&quot; was simply a vehicle for Forrest&#x27;s career and a story that suited the romantic ideals of its audience. “The overemphasis of political and racial ideology as the preeminent analytical context may cloud rather than clarify the relationship between &quot;Metamora&quot; and Jacksonian Indian policy. A close consideration of &quot;Metamora&quot;’s place in antebellum culture, and the contexts in which it can be interpreted, should give pause to scholars who are quick to detect efforts to engineer political advantage in every corner of art and popular culture.&quot;

==Revivals==
In October 2004, the play was performed at the Metropolitan Playhouse in New York City as Metamora: Last of the Wampanoags! as a work exploring the American theatrical history. Directed by Alex Roe, then in his third year at the company, with Matthew Trumbull (b. Minnesota) starring as Metamora.

<text>An adaptive equalizer is an equalizer that automatically adapts to time-varying properties of the communication channel. It is frequently used with coherent modulations such as phase-shift keying, mitigating the effects of multipath propagation and Doppler spreading. 

Adaptive equalizers are a subclass of adaptive filters. The central idea is altering the filter&#x27;s coefficients to optimize a filter characteristic. For example, in case of linear discrete-time filters, the following equation can be used:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the vector of the filter&#x27;s coefficients, formula_3 is the received signal covariance matrix and formula_4 is the cross-correlation vector between the tap-input vector and the desired response. In practice, the last quantities are not known and, if necessary, must be estimated during the equalization procedure either explicitly or implicitly.
Many adaptation strategies exist. They include, e.g.:

* Least mean squares filter (LMS) Note that the receiver does not have access to the transmitted signal formula_5 when it is not in training mode. If the probability that the equalizer makes a mistake is sufficiently small, the symbol decisions formula_6 made by the equalizer may be substituted for formula_5.
* Stochastic gradient descent (SG)
* Recursive least squares filter (RLS)

A well-known example is the decision feedback equalizer, a filter that uses feedback of detected symbols in addition to conventional equalization of future symbols. Some systems use predefined training sequences to provide reference points for the adaptation process.

<doc id="1302124" wikidata="Q1630557" url="?curid=1302124" title="Baseboard">
<text>In architecture, a baseboard (also called skirting board, skirting, wainscoting, mopboard, trim, floor molding, or base molding) is usually wooden, MDF or vinyl board covering the lowest part of an interior wall. Its purpose is to cover the joint between the wall surface and the floor. It covers the uneven edge of flooring next to the wall, protects the wall from kicks, abrasion, and furniture, and can serve as a decorative molding.

At its simplest, baseboard consists of a simple plank nailed, screwed or glued to the wall; however, particularly in older houses, it can be made up of a number of moldings for decoration. A baseboard differs from a wainscot; a wainscot typically covers from the floor to around 1-1.5 metres (3&#x27; to 5&#x27;) high (waist or chest height), whereas a baseboard is typically under 0.2 metres (8&quot;) high (ankle height).

Plastic baseboard comes in various plastic compounds, the most common of which is UPVC. It is usually available in white or a flexible version in several colors and is usually glued to the wall. Vinyl baseboard is glued with adhesive and can be difficult to remove or to replace. It has a long lifespan, which can mean lower maintenance. 

Wooden baseboard can be available in untreated, lacquered or prepainted versions. Prepainted baseboards can be made from a single piece or finger jointed wood, often softwoods, while hardwoods are either lacquered, or raw for staining and made from a single piece of wood.

MDF (medium-density fiberboard) is a common material used for baseboard trim and molding. It is an engineered wood product manufactured from refined wood fibers combined with wax and resin binders. MDF is denser and more rigid than standard particle board. Compared to solid wood trim, MDF baseboard has the advantage of being consistent in thickness and profile. It resists warping, swelling, and shrinking that can occur with natural wood. MDF provides a smooth, stable surface for painting that resists absorption of paint. It is also typically cheaper than solid wood alternatives.

Tiles can also be used as a baseboard.

Heaters are sometimes installed in place of or in front of baseboards. These come in electrical and radiator varieties, the latter relying on hot water as their heat source.

<text>Jérémie Aliadière (; born 30 March 1983) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker.

As a graduate of the elite Clairefontaine academy, he signed for Arsenal at the age of 16. During his career he also played for Celtic in the Scottish Premier League, West Ham United in the Premier League, and Wolverhampton Wanderers, before returning to Arsenal for another season. At the beginning of the 2007–08 season he was sold to Premier League club Middlesbrough for £2.5 million.

In 2011 the striker signed for Lorient playing for Les Merlus til 2014. In September 2016, it was announced that Aliadière would be returning to the Stade du Moustoir, once again playing for Lorient.

==Early life==
Aliadière was born in Rambouillet, Yvelines.

==Club career==
===Arsenal===
Aliadière signed for Arsenal at the age of 16 before the beginning of the 1999–2000 season. He made his Premier League debut for Arsenal against Fulham in the 2001–02 season, replacing Thierry Henry in a 4–1 victory. That game was his only league appearance that season, meaning he was not eligible for a medal as Arsenal won the 2001–02 FA Premier League. He scored his first goal for the club the following season, in a 5–2 victory over West Bromwich Albion on 27 August 2002.

In the 2003–04 season, Aliadière was mainly played in the 2003–04 League Cup rather than the league, scoring Arsenal&#x27;s first League Cup goal of the season against Rotherham United. The match finished 1–1 after extra time, with Arsenal winning 9–8 on penalties. He also scored twice against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the following round of the League Cup, his second winning goal for the month for December. In total, he scored four goals in the cup run, having also scored against West Brom in the quarter-finals, with Arsenal finally being eliminated by Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. He was voted best young talent in the 2003–04 League Cup. As the season progressed, he made further inroads into the Arsenal first team, playing ten Premier League matches, seven as a substitute, to gain a Premier League winners&#x27; medal, as well as making his FA Cup debut in a 1–0 defeat against Manchester United in the semi-finals. He also came on as a late substitute in Arsenal&#x27;s 5–1 victory over Inter Milan in the San Siro. Seconds after coming on, he set up the fifth goal for Robert Pires.

Aliadière missed much of the following 2004–05 season after picking up an injury in the 2004 FA Community Shield, and was kept out of action until March. On his return, he made six substitute appearances for the first team, including the FA Cup semi-final against Blackburn Rovers. Although he failed to score in these matches, he scored eight goals in five games for Arsenal&#x27;s reserves. Despite his limited opportunities and being linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, he was offered and signed a new Arsenal contract, running until the summer of 2009, announced at the same time as a loan move to Celtic.

====Loan to Celtic====
In the summer of 2005, Aliadière was sent on loan to Scottish club Celtic for the entire 2005–06 season in order to play regular first team football. Despite his limited appearances, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had stated he had a future at Arsenal, despite being kept out of the side at the time by the form of Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp. In the end, his time at Celtic was forgettable; he made just two substitute appearances for the club, one in each leg of their loss to Artmedia Bratislava in the Champions League. He accused Celtic manager Gordon Strachan of not giving him a chance.

====Loan to West Ham United====
On 24 August 2005, Aliadière decided to move back to London after a lack of first team opportunities, where West Ham United took over his year-long loan deal, having been promoted back to the Premier League after two seasons in the lower leagues. Once again affected by injury, he only made eight appearances for West Ham, seven as a substitute.

====Loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers====
On 31 January 2006, West Ham terminated the loan, and Aliadière joined Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan for the remainder of the 2005–06 season. He scored two league goals for Wolves, in games against Hull City and Watford.

====Return to Arsenal====
Aliadière returned to Arsenal during the 2006–07 season but was again mainly used in the League Cup, scoring both goals in their 2–0 win over West Brom on 24 October 2006. His first Premier League appearance of the season came on 16 December 2006, a 2–2 draw against Portsmouth, with Aliadière playing for 55 minutes before being replaced by Emmanuel Adebayor. Continuing appearances in Arsenal&#x27;s League Cup campaign saw him score in the quarter-final against Liverpool in a 6–3 victory, and in the second leg of the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, with Arsenal advancing with a 3–1 win. Arsenal ultimately lost the final 2–1 to Chelsea, with Aliadière featuring for 80 minutes.

With four appearances in Premier League matches during the season, as of 9 January 2007 he had played 37 times for Arsenal, 25 as a substitute, scoring nine goals, all but one coming in the League Cup, four against West Brom. In the January 2007 transfer window, Aliadière was linked with a move to the Premier League club Middlesbrough in North East England, after Wenger said he would be allowed to leave the club. The move, however, failed to happen after Robin van Persie broke his foot, and he was told to stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance on the final day of the 2006–07 season against Portsmouth in a 0–0 draw at Fratton Park.

===Middlesbrough===
Middlesbrough signed Aliadière on 19 June 2007, for an initial fee of £2 million. He scored his first goal in a Premier League match against Manchester United at Old Trafford in October 2007, with a header to draw level at 1–1, before Middlesbrough went on to lose the game 4–1. This was his first Premier League goal, since scoring his first ever for Arsenal on 27 August 2002. He scored for Middlesbrough against old club Arsenal on 15 March in a 1–1 draw, before rounding off the season, scoring in the final day 8–1 victory over Manchester City on 11 May 2008.

Aliadière got a red card and three match ban for slapping Javier Mascherano in a 23 February 2008 Premier League match against Liverpool, after Mascherano had raised his hands against him, in full view of the referee. It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough&#x27;s consequent appeal was deemed as &quot;frivolous&quot; by The Football Association (FA) and extended by one more game, with the club&#x27;s chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, deeming this unfair and criticising The FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea&#x27;s Michael Essien.

Before the start of the 2008–09 season, Aliadière switched to wearing the number 10, previously worn by midfielder Fábio Rochemback, when his number 11 was given to £3.2 million summer signing Marvin Emnes. He scored his first goal of the season in Middlesbrough&#x27;s 5–1 home victory against Yeovil Town on 26 August 2008. His first Premier League goal of the season came in a 1–0 win against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium on 4 October 2008, scoring in the 89th minute of the match. After a run of not scoring in his next ten matches, he again scored against his old club Arsenal, with a headed equaliser in a home 1–1 draw on 13 December 2008. At the end of the season, Middlesbrough finished equal bottom of the Premier League with West Brom, on 32 points, and as a result were relegated to the Championship.

On 12 September 2009, he came off the bench against Ipswich Town to score two goals after 30 minutes of being on the pitch, and scored another goal in the same week against Sheffield Wednesday. His next goal came on 26 December against Scunthorpe United, in his first start under new manager Gordon Strachan due to injury. Having failed to reach the play-offs, and after three injury hit seasons at Middlesbrough, he left the club on 30 June 2010 at the end of his contract having decided not to take up the option of extending his contract. In total, he made 86 appearances and scored 12 goals for the club. The 2010–11 pre-season found Aliadière training with West Ham with a view to a permanent move to the London club. The deal fell through when he damaged his knee ligaments playing in a reserve game against Crystal Palace. Subsequently, his old club Middlesbrough offered the player full use of their rehabilitation and training facilities in order to overcome the injury and regain full fitness.

In January 2011, Aliadière also revealed he was linked with a move to Blackpool, but the move collapsed over contract issues; he described the experience as hitting &quot;rock-bottom&quot;. Al Ain, a club based in the United Arab Emirates, announced on 13 February 2011 that they had signed Aliadière, but he subsequently denounced their claim, stating that he had rejected a move and Al Ain had &quot;been very unprofessional in their conduct&quot;.

===Post-Middlesbrough===
In March 2011, Aliadière trained with former club Arsenal while looking for a club. Along with the newly re-signed goalkeeper Jens Lehmann he played the full 90 minutes in a reserve game against Wigan on 29 March 2011, losing the game 2–1.

===Lorient===
On 5 July 2011, Aliadière signed for Ligue 1 club Lorient on a free transfer, with an option for a three-year deal. It was revealed that Arsène Wenger helped Aliadiere seal his move to Lorient. He made his debut for Lorient in a 2–0 win against Valenciennes, then scored his first two goals in a 3–0 win over Saint-Étienne. On 18 October 2011, he agreed to a newly designed three-year deal with Lorient, which he officially signed on 1 November 2011.

In Lorient&#x27;s 2–2 draw with Paris Saint-Germain to start the 2012–13 Ligue 1 season, Aliadière scored Lorient&#x27;s second, putting them up 2–0 at the time. With his side down 4–1 at home to Ajaccio on 28 October 2012, he scored a second-half brace to help Lorient earn a point, as Gilles Sunu scored Lorient&#x27;s fourth goal in the dying seconds. On 9 December, Aliadière opened the scoring against title contenders Marseille, striking from the penalty spot and also provided the assist for Kévin Monnet-Paquet&#x27;s strike, as Lorient won comfortably 3–0 at the Stade Vélodrome.

On 12 December, Aliadière received the ball from a poor clearance by Sochaux goalkeeper Simon Pouplin and found Alain Traoré, who fizzed a long-range effort in off the left-hand post, giving Lorient a 1–0 lead; Lorient went on to win 2–0 and moved up to fourth in the Ligue 1 table. Lorient continued their ascent up the Ligue 1 table with a 2–0 defeat of Saint-Étienne on 16 December, Aliadière opening the scoring in the 20th minute after defeating two defenders and finishing past the goalkeeper. In the January transfer window, Aliadière was linked to a return move to England by joining Middlesbrough&#x27;s rival Newcastle United, for personal reasons, but the move was rejected by the club. Eventually, he remained at the club throughout the transfer window and said that transfer speculation did not affect his form, and even hints to play for the France national team.

In Lorient&#x27;s Brittany derby with Rennes on 2 February 2013, Aliadière scored the team&#x27;s second goal in a 2–2 draw. Ahead of the match, Aliadière told Ligue 1.com when asked about comparing the derbies, &quot;You can&#x27;t really compare them to be honest. The derbies I played in the UK were Arsenal versus Spurs or even Middlesbrough against Sunderland or Newcastle. The derbies here are not as fanatical as those in England. It&#x27;s obviously a big game and a game that the fans want to win but it won&#x27;t be the end of the world for them if they don&#x27;t. They are not as passionate as the people in the UK so it&#x27;s not as big.&quot;

Aliadière converted a penalty to open the scoring in a 2–1 defeat of Evian on 16 February, keeping Lorient within reach of securing European football. Aliadière expressed his pleasure at playing for manager Christian Gourcuff, stating that &quot;his vision of football ... means very good organization defensively&quot;.

===Umm Salal===
On 25 July 2014, it was announced that Aliadière had completed a transfer to Qatari side Umm Salal.

===Lorient===
In September 2016, Aliadère once again joined Lorient, signing on a free transfer. He left at the end of the 2016–17 season.

Aliadère retired from playing in 2018.

==International career==
Aliadière made five appearances and scored one goal for the France national under-21 team.

==Personal life==
Aliadière is of Swiss and Algerian descent and bears a tattoo with the flag of Algeria. Aliadière said that Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, during his six-year spell at the Gunners, was like a father to him. They remain in contact to the present day.

<doc id="1302142" wikidata="Q463635" url="?curid=1302142" title="Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)">
<text>Larry Demetric Johnson (born March 14, 1969) is an American former professional basketball player who spent his career as a power forward with the Charlotte Hornets and the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). An NCAA champion and two-time NBA All-Star, Johnson is a member of the Southern Nevada Sports Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Johnson won a version of national player of the year at the high school, junior college, and NCAA Division I levels.

==High school career==
Johnson played at Skyline High School in Dallas, Texas. As a senior, Johnson was a consensus All-American and was named Mr. Basketball USA. Johnson was a member of the 1987 McDonald&#x27;s High School All-American Team.

== College career ==

=== Odessa (1987–1989) ===
Johnson originally made a verbal commitment to play for Dave Bliss at Southern Methodist University, but he instead enrolled at Odessa College in Texas following a dispute with the SMU administration about the legitimacy of one of his SAT scores. He played the 1987–88 and 1988–89 seasons at Odessa, averaging 22.3 points per game as a freshman and over 29 points per game his sophomore year, becoming the first and, to date, only player ever to win the National Junior College Athletic Association Division 1 Player of the Year award both years played. There were even some basketball analysts who believed Johnson could have been a first round selection in the 1989 NBA draft (even a possible NBA lottery selection) if he had declared for early entry.

=== UNLV (1989–1991) ===
Johnson eventually transferred to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) to play under head coach Jerry Tarkanian.
Alongside future NBA players Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony, Johnson faced the Duke Blue Devils in the title game of the 1990 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament. UNLV went on to win the contest by a score of 103–73, with Johnson contributing 22 points and 11 rebounds. The Runnin&#x27; Rebels set numerous NCAA records in the tournament, including simultaneous NCAA records for the largest margin of victory and highest score in an NCAA Tournament championship game.

In a post-season mired by charges of recruiting violations and misconduct by UNLV, an agreement was reached between the university and the NCAA to allow for the defense of their title for the 1990–91 season, which would be followed by a suspension from post-season play the following season. Johnson and the Runnin&#x27; Rebels responded with a perfect regular season record of 27–0, with an average scoring margin of 26.7 points per game; this total included a 112–105 victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks, ranked second in the country at the time.

In the 1991 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament, UNLV won the West Regional Tournament only to be upset by eventual champion Duke in the Final Four. Johnson was named a First Team All-American twice, and won the Big West Conference Player of the Year and tournament Most Valuable Player awards in 1990 and 1991. He also won the prestigious John R. Wooden Award and was named Naismith College Player of the Year in 1991. To this day, Johnson is ranked 12th in career scoring and 7th in rebounding at UNLV despite playing only two seasons. He also holds the record for single-season and career field goal percentage. In 2002, Johnson and teammates Augmon and Anthony were inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame along with the 1990–91 UNLV men&#x27;s basketball team. To date they are the only UNLV team to make back-to-back Final Four appearances.

==Professional career==

=== Charlotte Hornets (1991–1996) ===
Johnson was selected first overall in the 1991 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, and won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in his first season. He also competed in the 1992 Slam Dunk Contest at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Orlando, finishing second to Cedric Ceballos of the Phoenix Suns.

In 1993, Johnson was voted to start in that year&#x27;s All-Star Game, making him the first Hornet in franchise history to receive that honor; he enjoyed his best statistical season with averages of 22.1 points per game and 10.5 rebounds per game in 82 games, which earned him All-NBA Second Team honors. Along with Alonzo Mourning, Muggsy Bogues and Dell Curry, Johnson played with the Hornets at the height of their popularity in the early to mid-1990s. During this time, Johnson, who went by his initialism &quot;LJ&quot; and the nickname &quot;Grandmama&quot; (because of a popular series of commercials for Converse, who signed Johnson to an endorsement contract following his entry into the NBA), was featured on the cover of the premiere issue of &quot;SLAM&quot;.

In October 1993, Johnson signed what was at the time the most lucrative contract in NBA history, a 12-year, $84 million deal with the Hornets. However, he missed 31 games after spraining his back on December 27, 1993, in a game against the Detroit Pistons. During the summer he played for the U.S. national team (nicknamed Dream Team II) in the 1994 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal.

Johnson had entered the league as an explosive power forward, averaging over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game. However, after the injury to his back, Johnson was forced to develop an all-around game with an improved outside shot. In the 1994–95 season, he made 81 three-pointers, nearly 60 more than in his first three years combined, and was selected to the 1995 NBA All-Star Game.

Friction between Johnson and Mourning forced the organization to make a change, and the resulting moves made by the Hornets left both players on other teams. Prior to the 1995–96 season, Mourning was traded to the Miami Heat for Glen Rice and Matt Geiger. Following that season, Johnson was dealt to the New York Knicks for Anthony Mason and Brad Lohaus.

=== New York Knicks (1996–2001) ===
Johnson averaged 12.8 points, a career-low, in his first season as a Knick, and although he would never return to his former All-Star form, he was a key member of the Knicks&#x27; 1999 Eastern Conference championship team. Johnson took on a lesser role as the Knicks turned to Allan Houston and later Latrell Sprewell as the team&#x27;s top scorers.

During Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he was involved in a critical play in which he was fouled by Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Standing outside the three-point line with 11.9 seconds left, Johnson held the ball, and then began to dribble. He leaned into defender Davis before jumping up. The referee called the foul about a half-second before Johnson released the ball, but it was counted as a continuation shooting foul. Johnson made the shot and converted the free throw following the basket for a four-point play, which turned out to be the winning margin in a 92–91 Knicks victory.

During the 1999 NBA Finals, Johnson characterized the Knicks as a band of &quot;rebellious slaves&quot;. Bill Walton later called Johnson and his performance a &quot;disgrace&quot;. When Johnson was asked about the play of San Antonio Spurs point guard Avery Johnson in Game 4, Johnson again shifted the topic to slavery: &quot;Ave, man, we&#x27;re from the same plantation. You tell Bill Walton that. We from Massa Johnson&#x27;s plantation.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Here&#x27;s the NBA, full of blacks, great opportunities, they made beautiful strides. But what&#x27;s the sense of that ... when I go back to my neighborhood and see the same thing? I&#x27;m the only one who came out of my neighborhood. Everybody ended up dead, in jail, on drugs, selling drugs. So I&#x27;m supposed to be honored and happy or whatever by my success. Yes, I am. But I can&#x27;t deny the fact of what has happened to us over years and years and years and we&#x27;re still at the bottom of the totem pole.&quot;

Johnson also played a central role in the developing rivalry between the Knicks and the Heat. In Game 5 of the 1997 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Johnson was one of several players who left the Knicks bench during a brawl involving teammate Charlie Ward and Miami&#x27;s P. J. Brown; he was eventually suspended for Game 7 which the Knicks lost. Then in Game 4 of the 1998 Eastern Conference First Round, Johnson and former Hornets teammate Mourning engaged in a fight which also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy holding onto Mourning&#x27;s leg. Both Johnson and Mourning were suspended for Game 5, in which the seventh-seed Knicks eliminated the second-seed Heat.

On October 10, 2001, Johnson announced his early retirement from basketball due to chronic back problems that had plagued him for several years, after his point production had decreased for three straight years.

==Post-playing career==
In July 2007, Johnson expressed interest in making a comeback with the Knicks in some type of &quot;leadership role&quot;.
On December 21, 2007, Johnson received a Bachelor of Arts degree in social science studies from UNLV. In 2008, Johnson was inducted into the Southern Nevada Sports Hall of Fame. He was hired by the Knicks as a basketball and business operations representative on April 8, 2012. In 2014, he was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Johnson converted to Islam. During the NBA season, he observed Ramadan, the holy month of fasting.

Johnson has five children with four women. In 2015, he filed for bankruptcy in a California court, claiming he owed more than $120,000 in unpaid child support.

==Film and television==
In 1993, Johnson appeared in the episode &quot;Grandmama&quot; of the sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot; as his alter ego &quot;Grandmama&quot; (pronounced Grand Ma-Ma), who becomes Steve Urkel&#x27;s teammate in a basketball tournament. Later that year, he was a guest on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Three years later he appeared as himself in the movies &quot;Eddie&quot; and &quot;Space Jam&quot;; in the latter he had a supporting role as a fictionalized version of himself. He was one of the NBA stars who had their basketball abilities stolen alongside Muggsy Bogues, Shawn Bradley, Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing.

<text>Powellite is a calcium molybdate mineral with formula CaMoO4. Powellite crystallizes with tetragonal – dipyramidal crystal structure as transparent adamantine blue, greenish-brown, yellow-to-grey typically anhedral forms. It exhibits distinct cleavage, and has a brittle-to-conchoidal fracture. It has a Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4 and a specific gravity of 4.25. It forms a solid solution series with scheelite (calcium tungstate, CaWO4). It has refractive index values of nω=1.974 and nε=1.984.

Powellite was first described by William Harlow Melville in 1891 for an occurrence in the Peacock Mine, Adams County, Idaho, and named for American explorer and geologist, John Wesley Powell (1834–1902).

It occurs in hydrothermal ore deposits of molybdenum within the near-surface oxidized zones. It also appears as a rare mineral phase in pegmatite, tactite and basalt. Minerals found in association with powellite include molybdenite, ferrimolybdite, stilbite, laumontite and apophyllite.

<text>Kashan (; ) is a city in the Central District of Kashan County, in the northern part of Isfahan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

==History==

Earliest evidence of human presence around Kashan date back to Paleolithic period that have been found at Niasar, Kaftar Khoun and Sefid-Ab. Middle Paleolithic stone tools were discovered at travertine spring of Niasar and the travertine of Kaftar Khoun. Upper Paleolithic groups were living around Sefid-Ab spring at SW of Kashan.

By some accounts, although not all, Kashan was the origin of the three wise men who followed the star that guided them to Bethlehem to witness the nativity of Jesus, as recounted in the Bible. For example, medieval traveler Friar Odoric of Pordenone related this story in 1330 after having visited there.

According to a legend dating from the Safavid era, Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a, the Persian skilled craftsman who was enslaved by the Islamic conquerors and who eventually assassinated the caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab in 644, fled to Kashan after the assassination. The shrine that was built over his supposed tomb is one of Kashan&#x27;s landmarks (see gallery below).

During the rule of Timurid Empire, Kashan were patronized by Ulugh Beg, grandson of Timur. After the era of Timurid rulers, Kashan then came simultaneously under the rule of Qara Qoyunlu, and then Aq Qoyunlu. Kashan was also a leisure vacation spot for Safavid kings. 

The earthquake of 1778 leveled the city of Kashan and all the edifices of Shah Abbas Safavi, leaving 8000 casualties. But the city started afresh.

This city is also known as Dar al-Mominin.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 248,789 in 67,464 households. The following census in 2011 counted 275,325 people in 80,015 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 304,487 people in 91,935 households.

== Geography ==
Kashan is divided into two parts, mountainous and desert. 
===Location===
The city of Kashan is located in the north of Isfahan province, north of the Karkas Mountains and west of Dasht-e Kavir desert, where it is poor in terms of vegetation and where bushes and shrubs are more or less found.

===Mountains===
Dare mountain is next to Dare village and 14 kilometers southwest of Kashan with a height of 2,985 meters overlooking the city of Kashan, and Gargash peak is the second highest peak of the Karkas mountain range (the first is mount Karakas in Natanz), 33 kilometers southwest of Kashan and 12 kilometers southwest of Qamsar and 7 kilometers northeast of Kamu with a height of 3,600 meters is located near the city of Kamu and Chogan. Kashan has the least light and air pollution. For this reason, it was chosen by international experts as the most appropriate and best place to establish the National Observatory of Iran, and the home of one of the largest large telescopes in the Middle East with the latest technology.

Ardahal peak is located 35 kilometers west of Kashan with a height of 3505 meters after Gargash, is the highest point of Kashan heights (continuation of the central mountain range) in the vicinity of Niaser and the villages Nashlej and Mashhad.

===Climate===

Kashan has a hot desert climate, with (&quot;BWh&quot;) designation in Köppen climate classification and (&quot;BW&quot;) in Trewartha climate classification, with cold winters (although warmer than other Iranian cities) and very hot and dry summers. Kashan is significantly warmer than other cities in the Iranian Plateau due to its lower elevation. 

==Main sights==
On August 9, 2007, Iran placed the Historical Axis of Fin, Sialk, Kashan on its Tentative List for possible future nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The exact definition of what locations within Kashan proper might be nominated was not made clear. In 2012 Iran successfully nominated the Fin Garden separately for inscription by UNESCO as a part of its Persian Gardens World Heritage Site. Despite this the &quot;Historical-Cultural Axis of Fin, Sialk, Kashan&quot; remains in full on Iran&#x27;s Tentative List. The Boroujerdiha house is one of the historical places from the Qajar period.

<text>Arkadi Arshaviri Ghukasyan (; born 22 June 1957) is an Armenian politician who served as the second President of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. He was elected as the President on 8 September 1997 and re-elected in 2002, until his term ended on 7 September 2007 and was succeeded by Bako Sahakyan. He was detained by Azerbaijani forces after the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh and is currently facing criminal charges in Azerbaijan.

== Biography ==

Arkadi Ghukasyan was born in Stepanakert in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Republic of the Azerbaijan SSR on 22 June 1957. He graduated from Yerevan State University with a degree in linguistics in 1979. He started his career as a correspondent for the newspaper (&quot;Soviet Karabakh&quot;), becoming its deputy editor-in-chief in 1981.

In 1991, Ghukasyan was elected to the first parliament of the newly declared Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR). In September 1992, he was appointed political adviser to the Chairman of the State Defense Committee, and headed the NKR&#x27;s delegations during OSCE-mediated negotiations with Azerbaijan.

Ghukasyan was a member of Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s Security Council since 1993. On 23 July 1993, he became the first Foreign Minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

He survived an assassination attempt in 2000. Samvel Babayan, whom he had recently sacked as defence minister, was convicted of organising the attack and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Babayan was released from imprisonment on 18 September 2004 due to health concerns, with the terms of release including a probationary period and continued disenfranchisement.

In 2015, it was reported that Ghukasyan was the unofficial leader of the Artsakh Republican Party.

Ghukasyan and the other arrested former officials are reportedly facing &quot;grave criminal charges&quot; in Azerbaijan.

<text>The Opel Commodore is an executive car (E-segment) produced by Opel from 1967 to 1986. It is the six-cylinder variant of the Rekord with styling differences. The Commodore nameplate was used by Opel from 1967 to 1982 in Europe and to 1986 in South Africa. However, its nameplate/lineage continued until 2020 with the Australian [[Holden Commodore]]. The last generation was sold in the United Kingdom primarily as the Vauxhall Viceroy although Opel models were also sold.

==Commodore A (1967–1971)==


The Opel Commodore A was manufactured from 1967 to 1971, based on the Rekord C. After having offered a Rekord-6 powered by a 2.6 L 6-cylinder engine (which originated in the Opel Kapitän and Admiral) since March 1964, Opel in February 1967 launched the Commodore as a faster up-market version of the Rekord. The Commodore was initially available with the known the 2.2-litre six and a larger 2.5 L engine developing with a single carburettor. The 2239 cc engine with which the Commodore was launched shared its 82.5 x 69.8 mm cylinder dimensions with the four-cylinder 1492 cc Rekord engine on which it was based. The unit was first seen in the short-lived six-cylinder version of the Opel Rekord towards the end of 1966, but ceased to be offered in the Rekord after July 1967 when it became the entry level power unit for the newly introduced Opel Commodore. Body styles comprised a two-door or four-door notchback saloon and a two-door hardtop/fastback coupé. In September 1967 the sporty Commodore GS offering from a dual-carburettor 2.5-litre six was introduced.

For the 1969 model year, the carryover 2.2-litre six was dropped and the optional 2-speed Powerglide automatic was abandoned in favor of Opel&#x27;s new 3-speed automatic transmission.

From September 1969, the base 2.5 L-engine was pumped up to ; at the same time, both remaining engines received hydraulic lifters for smoother running, a new exhaust system and six camshaft bearings. The handbrake lever was moved from its position under the dash to a location between the front seats and the fuel tank was enlarged from 55 to 70 litres.

An even more sporty model than the GS, the Commodore GS/E, debuted in March 1970. It had a 2.5 L engine equipped with Bosch D-jetronic fuel injection system developing , which gave the car a top speed of . The Commodore GS/E also had a career in motorsports, with a car prepared by Steinmetz. In April 1970 a Commodore with a detuned and carburetted 2.8 L-six giving followed (GS 2800).

156,330 Commodore As were built, including 2,574 GS and GS/E variants.

The Rekord C/Commodore A &quot;V body&quot; platform was used by GM to produce other models in many markets, these include the Ranger sold in mainland Europe and also in South Africa, as well as the GM Opala which was built and sold in South America from 1968 through to 1992. Ranger and Opala production commenced two years after the Commodore A&#x27;s debut in 1966.

Today the name Commodore is a name synonymous with GM Holden of Australia. However, that wasn&#x27;t always the case: The first-generation Holden Commodore actually is equivalent to the &quot;third&quot;-generation Opel Commodore.

GS/E History

All engines for the Commodore were 12 valve, CIH straight-six engines ranging from 2.2 to 2.8 litres. All but one engine option had single-barrel (2.2) or double-barrel (2.5; 2.8) downdraught carburetor. in 1970 the GS/E model was introduced which as its badge implies did not utilise carburetors, the &quot;E&quot; meaning &quot;Einspritzung&quot; or fuel injection in English.

Opels didn&#x27;t have the reputation for performance cars in the period and they had seen the positive impact on sales for other race winning manufacturers on having performance models in their range of cars. Opel wanted to be in this area of the market and the results of this desire was the Commodore GS/E.

The carburettors were ditched in favour of a Bosch D-Jetronic, Bosch&#x27;s first commercially produced electronic fuel injection system. Bosch D-Jetronic was a very early version of multi-point EFI, the “D” stood for “drucksensorgesteuert” (pressure sensor regulated). Unlike later Bosch fuel injection system, the injection was direct to the cylinder instead of via the Plenum inlets, which meant the a specific cylinder head was manufactured specifically for the engine, making this model unique and expensive to produce and purchase. Different from older mechanical injection systems, it incorporated taking input from the pressure inside the intake manifold. This is known as the Air Mass Sensor or in modern terms this would be known as the MAP-sensor (manifold absolute pressure), a part that&#x27;s commonly found in more modern vehicles.

Bosch sold the patent to Japanese companies that continue to produce injection systems based on D-Jetronic.

D-Jetronic fuel injection was installed onto the 2.5 litre engine with the modified cylinder head, increasing power by , making it more powerful than the larger 2.8 litre engine. The fuel injected engine, named 2500 E, now produced at 5,800 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm with an unchanged compression ratio of 9.5:1. For comparison, the base model Porsche 911T in 1970 had less, but was more expensive. The GS/E could accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 9.5 seconds, a similar value to the same period Porsche 911. It could also reach a top speed of .

The GS/E Coupe model is known affectionately as the &quot;German Charger&quot;.

==Commodore B (1972–1977)==
The Commodore B was based on the Rekord D, and launched in 1972. As in the previous generation, four models were offered: 2500 S, 2500 GS, 2800 GS, and 2800 GS/E, as a four-door saloon and two-door hardtop coupé (although the fastback design was replaced by a more conventional three-box design). Power of the 2.5-litre engine was depending on the specifications (25S/25H), while carburetted 2.8-liters had . The fuel injected 2.8 used in the GS/E has .

The Rekord and Commodore were also assembled as CKD kits in Belgium and Switzerland in the 1970s. These cars carried the name Ranger and differed from the originals in having different grilles and trim. These cars were exported to various countries.

In 1974, due to new regulations regarding pollutant emissions, the 2.5-litre models were dropped and the 2.8 L models were detuned to . Commodore B production ended in 1977.

The Commodore B series was like the A series briefly used in motorsports, and the extreme &quot;Jumbo&quot; Commodore raced in the 1974 &quot;interserie&quot;. It used a 6.0-litre V8 engine and had large wings which almost made it unrecognizable as an Opel. It never enjoyed much success despite its massive powerplant and impressive output.

===Foreign assembly===
Opel Commodores were also built in Iran between 1974 and 1976 under the name Chevrolet Iran 2800, 2500, Royal and Custom with both 2.5 L and 2.8 L engines by Pars Khodro (General Motors Iran). The first Royale, also the first Chevrolet car built in Iran, left the production line on 15 January 1974. The Royale sold well initially, but the car had not been re-engineered for Iranian conditions and the low ground clearance coupled with carburettor troubles led to its reputation quickly being tarnished. The car was withdrawn by early 1977, replaced by the locally-built versions of the Buick Skylark, Chevrolet Nova, and Cadillac Seville (American origins).

It was also assembled in South Africa, where it was called the Chevrolet 2500, 3800, and 4100, and was a top seller in that market. These received inline-four or -six engines of Chevrolet origins, built locally.
==Commodore C (1978–1986)==
The Commodore C was first shown in late 1977, at the same time as the Rekord E. It only entered series production in October the following year, however. The South African version of this car, the Chevrolet Commodore, was actually ahead of the European original model to enter production, in September 1978. The Commodore continued to be a larger and more luxurious version of the Rekord. There was no coupé version of the Commodore C, as it was replaced by the Opel Monza, the coupé version of the Opel Senator, but a two-door notchback saloon was available until June 1981. The single engine used by the Commodore in Europe was the well-known straight-six 2.5-litre unit with or when fitted with fuel injection.

The Commodore C was never a success, occupying an uncomfortably narrow niche between the Rekord and Senator. Another concern was the fuel mileage, with a fuel injected Commodore taking considerably more fuel than the larger three-liter Senator. The outdated engine also had little torque available at lower engine speeds, and was noisy.

The new model featured a similar front end to the larger Senator. It was sold in the UK under the name Vauxhall Viceroy, with the Viceroy being a slightly more luxurious version of the Carlton. There was an estate version (dubbed the &quot;Voyage&quot; in Germany) offered in the Opel range from April 1981 until the end of production in 1982, which became a mainstay in the Holden range in Australia and was also available in the Chevrolet range in South Africa. It was never offered by Vauxhall in the UK as a Viceroy, although a one-off estate car was built in 1981 for Queen Elizabeth II, for her to carry her Corgi dogs. The car still survives today, one of only 15 Vauxhall Viceroys left registered in the UK, as of 2006.

The Commodore was dropped by Opel in Europe in 1982. It was this model which the early Holden Commodore models were based on, introduced in late 1978, and eventually replaced (after several facelifts) in 1988, with the VN Commodore, a model based on the then-current Senator and Omega models.

===Manufacture elsewhere===
It was the Opel Commodore and Vauxhall Viceroy that formed the basis for the first Holden Commodore in Australia, and was sold in South Africa as the Chevrolet Commodore until 1982, when it was rebadged as an Opel. The South African Commodore was introduced in July 1978, at the same time as the Rekord E went on sale there. These originally had Chevrolet engines, pushrod inline-sixes of 3.8 or 4.1 liters. Sold as a standard or a GL (with the 4.1 only available as a sedan with automatic transmission), the South African version replaced the earlier Chevrolet 3800 and 4100, also based on the Commodore.

However, in South Africa, General Motors South Africa (later Delta) offered a revised version of the Commodore until 1986, again combining the bodyshell of the Rekord with the front end of the revised Senator. It was also sold there with the same 3-litre inline-six, producing .

<text>Saint Andrew (Guernésiais: Saint Andri; ) is located in the centre of Guernsey and as such is the only parish on the island to be landlocked.

As it is customary to list the parishes round the coast, either clockwise or anti-clockwise, starting with St Peter Port, St Andrew is usually the last parish to be mentioned in such a list. This gave rise to the traditional nickname in Dgèrnésiais of the inhabitants of the parish: &quot;les croinchaons&quot; (the siftings, what is left behind in the sieve).

==General==
Saint Andrew is located in the centre of the island and features hills and valleys. It is split into two parts, one bordering St Peter Port and one bordering St Saviour and the Forest. The upper part of the parish where the church and the Little Chapel is situated is very rural. The parish is mainly agricultural, Best&#x27;s quarry now being used for water storage. St Andrews is the most expensive parish for buying property in Guernsey, closely followed by St Pierre Du Bois and St Saviour. The postal code for street addresses in this parish begins with GY6.

==Features==
The features of the parish include:
* Churches:
** Saint Andrew parish church 
** The Monnaie Chapel 
** La Villiaze Church 
* The Little Chapel, which is believed to be the world&#x27;s smallest consecrated church.
* Military:
** Parish war memorial inside church 
** German Military Underground Hospital 
** German fortifications, built during the occupation 1940-45
* Abreuvoirs (places for cattle to drink) 
* A number of protected buildings 

The parish of Saint Andrew hosts:
* St Andrew Douzaine
* Princess Elizabeth Hospital
* Les Bourgs Hospice 
* Grammar School
* Blanchelande College
* Specsavers Optical Group
* St Andrew water storage reservoir
* Various hotels and restaurants

==Politics==
St Andrew comprises part of the South East administrative division with St Martin.

In the 2016 Guernsey general election there was a 3,363 or 73% turnout to elect five Deputies. Those elected (in order of votes received) being &quot;Heidi Soulsby&quot;, &quot;Lindsay De Sausmarez&quot;, &quot;Peter Roffey&quot;, &quot;Rob Prow&quot; and &quot;Victoria Oliver&quot;.

<doc id="1302217" wikidata="Q16185260" url="?curid=1302217" title="Billy Birmingham">
<text>Billy Birmingham (born 18 January 1953) is an Australian humorist and sometime sports journalist, most noted for his parodies of Australian cricket commentary in recordings under The Twelfth Man name.

==Early career==
He wrote the pun-laden comedy hit &quot;Australiana&quot;, which was made famous by performer Austen Tayshus and reached No. 1, ultimately becoming the most successful single on the Australian charts in 1983.

==&quot;The Twelfth Man&quot;==

In 1984 he released his first record as The Twelfth Man, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Just Not Cricket&quot;. This went on to become his most successful series of recordings, with eight albums being released between 1987 and 2006. The premise involved Birmingham impersonating and satirizing the Channel Nine cricket commentary team, particularly Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry and Tony Greig.

During the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Birmingham also recorded a series of mock-commentaries on Olympic events as the &quot;Wired World of Sports&quot;, featuring such characters as the American track-and-field representative &quot;Chuck DeWobblee&quot; (&quot;chucked a wobbly&quot; – meaning to throw a tantrum) and the Ukrainian pole-vaulter &quot;Olga Bedjanodgonnagedova&quot; (&quot;bet you&#x27;re not gonna get over&quot;), while also releasing the single under the 12th Man name, &quot;Bruce 2000&quot;, featuring an impersonation of famed commentator Bruce McAvaney during the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.

Birmingham has commented on his relationship with Richie Benaud, stating that he was kind when meeting with him, but a problem he had with his albums was the amount of obscenities he used when impersonating him, and that he thought it didn&#x27;t reflect him personally. He has also stated that his favorite person to impersonate was Richie Benaud, as well as stating that over the years that things associated with the 12th Man have become conflated with Richie Benaud. Specifically, the 12th Man&#x27;s interpretation of Benaud&#x27;s &quot;Two for twenty two&quot; phrase, saying that Benaud never said that—apart from when it was the score.

==&quot;The Back Page&quot;==
In 1997, Birmingham joined as a regular guest on the panel discussion show &quot;The Back Page&quot;, alongside host Mike Gibson. Ironically, Gibson was sent up by Birmingham in 1987 on his Twelfth Man album &quot;Wired World of Sports&quot;.

Birmingham is famous for being able to find humour amid the hyperbole of world sport. Following Michael Clarke&#x27;s debut innings of 151 against India in 2004, there was considerable praise for him – including comments that the young man was the new Donald Bradman and that he should captain Australia. Birmingham announced on &quot;The Back Page&quot; that he was going to nominate Clarke for Australian of the Year: &quot;He&#x27;s just that good.&quot;

A skilled impersonator, Birmingham is also used on the show as a means of interviewing a sporting celebrity who is otherwise unavailable. His impression of Australian rugby union coach Eddie Jones following the decision to award a Super Rugby franchise to Perth was a prime example of this, even to the point that another panelist held Birmingham&#x27;s left eyebrow in place in order to have him look like the man he was pretending to be. At one point, Birmingham even began an impression of Gibson, which he quickly ceased performing, upon deciding (tongue-in-cheek) that it might endanger his career. He also is well known for spontaneously impersonating Richie Benaud during discussions about cricket, having once said during a debate about Twenty20 cricket, &quot;Why not twenty-two overs for the two sides?&quot; (taking advantage of Benaud&#x27;s characteristic pronunciation of the letters T and S). In the lead-up to the Melbourne Cup, Birmingham also frequently adopts the distinctive high-pitched voice of a jockey.

Birmingham is also known for his ability to cover up any ignorance he might have of players&#x27; names by creating new ones in keeping with the country in question. For example, a discussion about the New Zealand national rugby league team collapsed into laughter when Birmingham praised, among others, the performance of &quot;the centre, Waisiwerina Silitupe&quot; (&quot;Why&#x27;s he wearing a silly toupee?&quot;).

In December 2012, Birmingham quit the show soon after Mike Gibson&#x27;s departure, with the incumbents on the show being Matt Shirvington and Tony Squires.

<doc id="1302223" wikidata="Q7007376" url="?curid=1302223" title="New England Science Fiction Association">
<text>The New England Science Fiction Association, or NESFA, is a science fiction club centered in the New England area. It was founded in 1967, &quot;by fans who wanted to &quot;do&quot; things in addition to socializing&quot;. NESFA is currently registered as a non-profit literary organization under IRS section 501(c)(3).

The organization holds regular meetings (at their dedicated site, the NESFA Clubhouse) of and for members and other interested parties. A weekly meeting is held most Wednesday evenings, for socializing, projects, and miscellaneous business. Two weekend meetings are held every month: a Business Meeting (for administration), and the Other Meeting. The club also publishes a regular newsletter, &quot;Instant Message&quot;. There are two book groups that meet on a monthly basis, as well as a monthly Game Day, and a monthly Game Night. In addition, there is a monthly Media day. This involves showings of two episodes of an anime series, two TV series episodes and a movie choice. All are science fiction/fantasy related. There is currently a NESFA Short Story Contest, accepting submissions from amateur writers seeking to improve their science fiction/fantasy writing through constructive critical analysis from expert readers, editors, and professional writers.

==Boskone==
The club runs an annual science fiction convention, Boskone. In the words of the convention organizers, &quot;Boskone is a regional Science Fiction convention focusing on literature, art, music, and gaming (with just a dash of whimsy)&quot;. It is held over a weekend every February, in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. The name is a reference to the classic Lensman series by E. E. Smith, in which &quot;Boskone&quot; is a council of villains, and also a name for their civilization. The obvious name for a con in Boston would, of course, be &quot;Boscon&quot;; the similarity was noticed and embraced. Continuing the trend, when a new Boston-area convention was formed, the organizers of that event named it &quot;Arisia&quot;, the name of the civilization for which the protagonists work in the Lensman series.

Boskone I was held in 1941 under the auspices of The Stranger Club, an earlier Boston-based SF club. Four more were held annually, ending with Boskone V in 1945. The current series of Boskones started in 1965 with Boskone 1 and continued without interruption to the present. Boskone 1, 2, and 4 were run by BosSFS, the now-defunct Boston Science Fiction Society. The then-newly formed NESFA took over with Boskone 5. The tradition of holding Boskone in February started in 1976.

==NESFA Press==
NESFA has a small publishing arm, NESFA Press, which specializes in classic and neglected works of science fiction, as well as SF/fandom reference and historical material. Works published by NESFA press include:

* &quot;Once More* with Footnotes&quot;, by Terry Pratchett (2004)
* &quot;Norstrilia&quot; by Cordwainer Smith (1995)
* &quot;The Rediscovery of Man&quot; by Cordwainer Smith (1993)

==Awards==

===Skylark Award===
The Edward E. Smith Memorial Award for Imaginative Fiction (the Skylark) is presented annually by NESFA to some person, who, in the opinion of the membership, has contributed significantly to science fiction, both through work in the field and by exemplifying the personal qualities which made the late &quot;Doc&quot; Smith well loved by those who knew him.

===Jack Gaughan Award===
The Jack Gaughan Award is presented annually to an emerging artist chosen by a panel of judges (which have included Vincent Di Fate, Kelly Freas, Michael Whelan, David Cherry, Bob Eggleton, Tyler Jacobson, and Ron Walotsky).

==MCFI==
NESFA also hosts meetings of Massachusetts Convention Fandom, Inc. MCFI, a non-profit like NESFA, is responsible for various &quot;special&quot; conventions in the New England area. Most notable of these is Noreascon, MCFI&#x27;s occasional Worldcon bid. The most recent of these was Noreascon Four, the 62nd World Science Fiction Convention, in September 2004. MCFI has also hosted SMOFcon, Ditto, and the World Fantasy Convention. MCFI is a separate legal entity from NESFA, though there is a large overlap in membership.

<doc id="1302225" wikidata="Q6767601" url="?curid=1302225" title="Mark Fields (linebacker)">
<text>Mark Fields (born November 9, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He had a ten-year career with the New Orleans Saints, St. Louis Rams, and the Carolina Panthers before missing the 2005 NFL season due to being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma for the second time in three seasons and subsequently retiring.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Fields attended Washington Preparatory High School, Southwest College, and Compton College. He transferred to Washington State University in Pullman, and played middle linebacker under head coach Mike Price. As a senior in 1994, he was All-Pac-10, and its Defensive Player of the Year.

==NFL==
Fields was the thirteenth overall selection in the first round of the 1995 NFL draft, taken by the New Orleans Saints. He played six years in New Orleans, leading or coming close to the team lead in tackles. He later played one year with the St. Louis Rams, appearing in Super Bowl XXXVI (losing to the New England Patriots) then signed with the Carolina Panthers in 2002.

However, before the start of the 2003 season, he learned he had Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, and he was forced to sit the season out. Both he and linebackers coach Sam Mills were sources of inspiration for the team, which made it to Super Bowl XXXVIII, but Fields again lost to the New England Patriots. Fields returned to play in 2004

Fields learned before the start of the 2005 season that his Hodgkin&#x27;s had returned, and so he turned down a new contract offer from Carolina.

==NFL career statistics==
=== Regular season ===
===Playoffs===
==Personal life==
On August 10, 2010, Fields was arrested for assaulting the mother of his then-six-year-old daughter while she was picking her daughter up from daycare. Mark would be charged for aggravated assault, endangerment, disorderly conduct, and interfering with an educational institution as a result.

His son, Mark Fields II played cornerback in the NFL.

<text>Giuseppe Avati, better known as Pupi Avati (born 3 November 1938), is an Italian film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is known to horror film fans for his two &quot;giallo&quot; masterpieces, &quot;The House with Laughing Windows&quot; (1976) and &quot;Zeder&quot; (1983).

==Early life and career==
Pupi Avati was born in Bologna in 1938. After attending school and studying political science at the University of Florence, he started working at a frozen food company. At the same time, he developed a passion for jazz, becoming a proficient clarinetist. In the second half of the 1950s, he formed and played in the Doctor Dixie Jazz Band, of which Lucio Dalla was also a member.

Although he initially intended to be a professional musician, Avati felt he lacked the necessary talent. In the mid-1960s, he decided to dedicate himself to cinema after seeing Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; and its portrait of the role of a director. Avati&#x27;s passion for music, as well as his love for his hometown, which was the setting of many of his films, were to become recurrent themes found in his productions.

His first films were &quot;Balsamus. L&#x27;uomo di Satana&quot; (1968) e &quot;Thomas… gli indemoniati&quot; (1969).

His filmography as a director includes almost forty films and television works. As a screenwriter, Avati wrote or co-authored the majority of his movies, as well as screenplays for other directors. He cooperated on the script of &quot;Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma&quot; (&quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, 1976) directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, even though he is not credited for it. He also produced several films for other directors and in his own work. Many of his movies are also produced by his brother Antonio Avati.

Avati began his career directing horror films and is considered one of the most notable Italian directors of this genre, with titles including &quot;La casa dalle finestre che ridono&quot; (&quot;The House with Laughing Windows&quot;, 1976) and &quot;Zeder&quot; (1983), which are considered his masterpieces.

According to Avati, the TV series &quot;Jazz Band&quot; (1978), written about the story of the Doctor Dixie Jazz Band marked a turning point for his work. The subject of his movies began coming from his own experience, and his cinema became more nostalgic, introspective, and autobiographic. Moreover, the series was successful and brought Avati to the attention of a wider public compared to his previous films.

Throughout his career, Avati successfully directed and produced many genres of film, including horrors, medieval period pieces, dramas, jazz comedies, buddy comedies, biopics and others, proving himself to be a versatile director.

During his career as a director, screenwriter, and producer, Avati was nominated for the Golden Palm, Silver Ribbons, David di Donatello Awards, and many others. He won two David di Donatello Awards and five Silver Ribbons.

Avati was nominated &quot;Commendatore Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana&quot; on 2 June 1995.

He has presided over the Federico Fellini Foundation, created in 1995, in memory of the great Rimini-born director.

In 2008, Avati published his autobiography, &quot;Sotto le stelle di un film&quot;. Inspired by the autobiography of the director, in 2010, Claudio Costa made a documentary film of interviews and animations, called &quot;Pupi Avati, ieri oggi domani&quot; (&quot;Pupi Avati, yesterday today tomorrow&quot;).

He is also the author of the novels &quot;Il ragazzo in soffitta&quot; (2015), &quot;Il signor diavolo&quot; (2018), from which he made a film of the same name the following year, and &quot;L&#x27;archivio del diavolo&quot; (2020).

===Personal life===
Pupi Avati is married to Amelia &quot;Nicola&quot; Turri and has two sons and a daughter. He is Catholic.

<text>Nathan Haines (born 1972) is a New Zealand-born producer/vocalist/saxophonist based between London (since 1995) and his native Auckland.

==Life and career==
Haines was born in 1972 in Takapuna on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore. His father, Kevin was one of New Zealand&#x27;s leading jazz bassists and with his guitarist brother Joel, they were playing International Jazz Festivals by the time they were in their early teens. Haines played gigs with Joel across New Zealand, before moving to New York City in 1991 to study jazz music. He returned in 1994 and recorded and released his first solo record &quot;Shift Left&quot; in April 1995, also released in the UK on the Verve Records label.

In 1995, he moved to London. His first release was a co-written 12-inch single on Metalheadz with drum and bass producer Jason Cambridge (DJ name A-Sides) in 1997. The pair had several follow-up singles. In 2000, his first UK based solo record &quot;Sound Travels&quot;, produced by Phil Asher was released on the now defunct UK label Chillifunk Records, and in 2003 the follow-up &quot;Squire for Hire&quot; was released featuring Marlena Shaw, Damon Albarn, Vanessa Freeman, Rich Medina, keyboardists Kaidi Thatham, Mike Patto, Mark de Clive Lowe, and many others, and was certified gold for album sales in New Zealand. Both albums featured Haines singing self-penned jazz ballads including the popular &quot;Impossible Beauty&quot; featured on &quot;Sound Travels&quot;.

New Zealand-based albums since 2005 have included &quot;Life Time&quot;, recorded with the 100-piece New Zealand Symphony Orchestra with arrangements by ex-pat US based Alan Broadbent, &quot;Right Now&quot; produced with Chris Cox and released in the UK on Freestyle Records and featuring vocalists Marlena Shaw and Ty, and &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot;. The straight to analog two-track album &quot;The Poet&#x27;s Embrace&quot; recorded in 2013 and released on Warner Classics and Jazz in the UK and Germany was followed up with &quot;Vermillion Skies&quot;, both of which won the Tui New Zealand Jazz Album of the Year Award. Both albums were released on limited edition vinyl.

Haines spent most of 2014 recording &quot;5 A Day&quot; in rural Buckinghamshire with writing and production partner Mike Patto. It was released in New Zealand in November 2014 on both CD, download and vinyl formats and features vocalists Vanessa Freeman, Kevin Mark Trail with Mike and Nathan on recording and production duties with drum programming from 4hero producer Marc Mac.

<doc id="1302232" wikidata="Q289455" url="?curid=1302232" title="DeShaun Foster">
<text>DeShaun Xavier Foster (born January 10, 1980) is an American college football coach and former player who is the head football coach for the UCLA Bruins. He played professionally as a running back for six seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Foster played collegiately for UCLA, earning All-American honors in 2001. He is a member the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.

Foster was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft. He played five seasons for the Panthers and one for the San Francisco 49ers. He became a coach, serving as an assistant coach for the Texas Tech Red Raiders and UCLA. The Bruins promoted him to head coach in 2024, after previously accepting a job as Running backs coach for the Las Vegas raiders under coach Antonio Pierce before being offered the UCLA head coaching job.

==Early life==
Foster was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. Although he and his family moved to Tustin, California when he was one year old, Foster continued to visit relatives in Charlotte regularly as a child. He attended Tustin High School in Tustin, California, and lettered three times each in football and basketball, and four times in track. As a senior in 1997, he was named the &quot;USA Today&quot; California Player of the Year and finished the year rushing for 3,998 rushing yards and a state single-season record 59 touchdowns on a Tustin football team that finished runners-up in the state championship against a Santa Margarita Catholic High School team with quarterback Carson Palmer. For his career, he rushed for a total of 5,885 yards.

==Playing career==
===College===
Foster played football at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he set a team rushing record for true freshmen with 673 yards and 10 touchdowns on 126 carries in 11 games. The next year, he spent mostly on the bench with an ankle sprain, but still managed to record 375 yards and 6 scores on 111 carries. As a junior, he led the Bruins with 1,037 yards, while scoring 13 touchdowns. In his final year in 2001, Foster posted 1,109 yards with 12 touchdowns; he had six games of over 100 rushing yards. He set a school record with a 301-yard game against Washington, and tied a record with four touchdowns (both records since broken by Maurice Jones-Drew). He was named a second-team All-American by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He ended his college career in the team top 10 in touchdowns, rushing yards, and points scored.

===National Football League===
====Carolina Panthers====

Foster was chosen in the second round (34th overall) of the 2002 NFL draft. He had a promising preseason, but was injured in a game against the New England Patriots, and sat out the remainder of the season on injured reserve. However, he returned the following season as a complement to Stephen Davis; whose bruising style matched well with Foster&#x27;s speed. Foster finished the regular season with 113 carries for 429 yards. However, his best performances came in the 2003-04 playoffs. He had a memorable run in the NFC Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles, where he broke four tackles on a one-yard run to score, giving the Panthers a 14–3 lead. In Super Bowl XXXVIII against the Patriots, Foster scored on a 33-yard run that stands as the fifth-longest touchdown run in Super Bowl history. The following season looked promising for the Panthers, but many of the starters suffered season-ending injuries, and Foster was no exception. He broke his clavicle in a game against the Denver Broncos. He returned the following season (2005) and surpassed Davis as the Panthers&#x27; starter. He led the team in yardage and carries, helping the Panthers to an 11–5 record. In a 23–0 wild card victory over the New York Giants, Foster set franchise records for carries (27), yards (151) and average (5.59) in a playoff game, but suffered a broken ankle in a playoff game against the Chicago Bears that left him out for the remainder of the playoffs (though it preserved his franchise record 102.5 yards per game in a playoff season).

On, March 10, 2006, Foster agreed to a three-year, $14.5 million contract with a $4.5 million signing bonus with another $3 million in escalators and incentives. This was a $700,000 raise over the transition tag tender placed on Foster in February. He led the team in rushing attempts and yards the next two seasons, increasingly splitting time with DeAngelo Williams.

On February 21, 2008, he was released by the Panthers.

====San Francisco 49ers====

On February 29, 2008, the San Francisco 49ers signed Foster to a one-year contract worth around $1.8 million, to be a back-up behind starter Frank Gore.
He played in 16 games, amassing 234 rushing yards and 133 receiving yards.

===NFL statistics===
==Coaching career==
===UCLA (first stint)===
In 2012, Foster joined UCLA as a volunteer assistant under head coach Jim L. Mora. In 2013, he became a graduate assistant at UCLA. In 2015, he became the program&#x27;s director of player development and high school relations.

===Texas Tech===
In 2016, Foster was hired as the running backs coach for the Texas Tech Red Raiders under head coach Kliff Kingsbury.

===UCLA (second stint)===
On January 21, 2017, Foster returned to UCLA as their running backs coach under head coach Jim L. Mora. In 2018, Foster was retained under head coach Chip Kelly. 

On February 12, 2024, Foster was hired as UCLA&#x27;s head coach, signing a five-year contract for $3 million in the first year with annual increases of $100,000.

==Personal life==
Foster and his wife, Charity, have one daughter together.

<doc id="1302238" wikidata="Q6437191" url="?curid=1302238" title="Kris Jenkins">
<text>Kristopher Rudy-Charles Jenkins (born August 3, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for the Carolina Panthers and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Maryland Terrapins. He was selected by the Panthers in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft. A two-time All-Pro and four-time Pro Bowl selection, Jenkins played seven seasons for the Panthers before being traded to the Jets in 2008.

==College career==
Jenkins played college football at the University of Maryland, where he started 27 of 41 games. He made the second-team All-ACC during his senior season. He finished with 9.5 sacks and 154 tackles.

==Professional career==

===2001 NFL draft===
Jenkins was selected in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft by Carolina.

===Carolina Panthers (2001–2007)===
Jenkins finished the 2002 season with 60 tackles and 7 sacks, en route to an alternate appearance on the NFC&#x27;s Pro Bowl team, where he replaced an injured Warren Sapp. The following season, he helped the Panthers on their way to Super Bowl XXXVIII. In one game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jenkins blocked two kicks: a field goal attempt by Martin Gramatica, and an extra point attempt that would have won the game. Jenkins&#x27; second block marked the first time that an extra point was blocked to send a game into overtime (Carolina later won the game). Jenkins was rewarded with his first Pro Bowl start, and joined teammate Mike Rucker as half of the NFC&#x27;s defensive front line.

However, the 2004 NFL season saw Jenkins suffer a shoulder injury in the second game against Kansas City, and he spent the latter half of the season on injured reserve. His injuries continued during the first game of the 2005 NFL season when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was once again placed on injured reserve.

===New York Jets (2008–2010)===
On February 29, 2008, the Carolina Panthers traded Jenkins to the New York Jets for third- and fifth-round draft picks in the 2008 NFL draft. The Panthers selected Charles Godfrey and Gary Barnidge with the traded picks. For much of his first season with the Jets, Jenkins was dominant and garnered heavy consideration for the NFL&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year award. On Sunday October 18, 2009, Jenkins left the game against the Buffalo Bills with a left knee injury. The next day, it was reported that he had a torn ACL and would be out for the rest of the season. During the home opener against the Baltimore Ravens on September 13, 2010, Jenkins was injured as he twisted his leg making a tackle. A few days later, an MRI revealed that Jenkins had again torn his ACL and was out for the rest of the 2010 season.

The Jets released Jenkins on February 28, 2011.

===Retirement===
Jenkins announced his retirement from football on July 20, 2011.

==Personal life==
Prior to the 2011 NFL season, Jenkins joined SNY as an analyst for New York Jets. His job included appearing on Jets programs such as pre-game and post-game shows and Jets Game Plan. He is the older brother of former defensive end, Cullen Jenkins, and the father of Kris Jenkins Jr, who was an All-American at the University of Michigan. Kris Jenkins Jr went on to be drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 2024 NFL Draft.

<text>Todd Scott Sauerbrun (; born January 4, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a punter in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons. He played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American in 1994. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 1995 NFL draft, and also played for the Kansas City Chiefs, Carolina Panthers, Denver Broncos and New England Patriots of the NFL, and the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League (UFL).

==Early life==
Sauerbrun was born and raised on Long Island, in Setauket, New York. He attended Ward Melville High School in East Setauket, and was a letterman in football and lacrosse. In football, as a senior, he averaged 45.1 yards per punt and kicked a field goal of 62 yards on October 27, 1990 (still the New York State high school record). In lacrosse, he was a high school U.S. Lacrosse All-America selection. He still holds the Ward Melville record for leading midfield scorer with 109 goals and 24 assists for 133 points.

==College career==
Sauerbrun attended West Virginia University, where he was a punter for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team from 1991 to 1994. He was a first-team All-Big East Conference selection in 1992, 1993, and 1994, and an honorable mention All-American in 1992 and 1993. As a senior in 1994, he set an NCAA record with a 48.4-yard punting average, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American.

==Professional career==
He was drafted by the Chicago Bears 56th overall in the 1995 NFL draft. He spent five seasons with the Bears, and is ranked second on the team in all-time punting average. Sauerbraun tore his ACL in the third game of the 1998 season and missed the rest of the year. He was injured after a Tampa Bay Buccaneers player landed on his leg after a punt that drew a roughing the punter penalty. He spent the 2000 season with the Kansas City Chiefs, and was signed by the Carolina Panthers before the 2001 season.

Sauerbrun achieved both his greatest success and biggest problems while with Carolina. He was picked for the Pro Bowl to represent the NFC in the 2002, 2003, and 2004 seasons. Sauerbrun also became the first player from either conference since the AFL-NFL Merger in 1970 to lead his conference in gross punting average for three consecutive seasons (2001–2003). However, during the 2004 season, the Panthers were riddled with injuries, and at one point, starting placekicker John Kasay suffered a leg injury, and the Panthers were forced to use Sauerbrun to replace Kasay. Sauerbrun refused to kick unless he was reimbursed for fines he incurred when he was overweight.

In December 2004, he was charged with driving under the influence, and he was named in an investigation of steroids use in the NFL linked to a South Carolina doctor during the 2004 season.

&#x27;s NFL off-season, Todd Sauerbrun held at least 10 Panthers franchise records, including:
* Punts: season (104 in 2002), game (11 on 2002-12-22 CHI), playoff season (21 in 2003), playoff game (7 on 2004-02-01; with 2 others)
* Punt Yards: season (4,735 in 2002), playoff season (910 in 2003)
* Yards / Punt: career (45.54), playoffs (43.33), playoff season (43.33 in 2003), playoff game (48.4 on 2004-01-03 DAL)

On May 19, 2005, Sauerbrun was traded to the Denver Broncos for punter Jason Baker and a 7th round draft pick in the 2006 draft. On July 7, 2006, Sauerbrun was suspended for the first four games of the NFL season after testing positive for the banned dietary supplement ephedra. On October 17, 2006, the day he was supposed to come back from his suspension, Denver cut him in favor of punter Paul Ernster.

One of Sauerbrun&#x27;s most notable NFL career moments occurred during the AFC Divisional Playoffs on January 14, 2006, when, in a rare move for a team punter, he managed to tackle New England Patriots returner Ellis Hobbs after his own kickoff and forced a fumble, which was recovered by teammate Cecil Sapp. This eventually led to a Broncos field goal, which helped Denver defeat the Patriots 27–13, ending New England&#x27;s bid for three consecutive Super Bowl victories.

Sauerbrun was signed by the Patriots on December 22, 2006, to a one-year contract that gave them the right to match any contract he signed the next offseason.

On April 3, 2007, the Denver Broncos signed Sauerbrun to a one-year contract. However, a week later, the Patriots announced their decision to match Denver&#x27;s offer to Sauerbrun. Shortly thereafter, the NFL Players Association filed a grievance on behalf of Sauerbrun regarding the details of the contract he signed with New England in 2006. On April 18, 2007, it was announced that Sauerbrun would once again be a free agent. Sauerbrun re-signed with the Denver Broncos on April 19, 2007.

Prior to facing the Chicago Bears, Sauerbrun stated that he would kick to Devin Hester, who was well known for his success as a kick and punt returner. Sauerbrun stated, &quot;We&#x27;re going after it. We&#x27;re not going to kick away from him. Hey, we respect him and he&#x27;s the best, but we have guys on our coverage teams that are paid to make big tackles.&quot; Hester responded by returning both a punt and kick-off for touchdowns. Sauerbrun attempted to tackle Hester on both returns, but failed. Later in the game, Sauerbrun had a punt blocked by Charles Tillman while attempting to kick away from Hester. Keith Olbermann, a commentator and anchor for NBC, awarded Sauerbrun with his dubious &quot;Worst Person in the NFL Award&quot;, for challenging Hester and failing to stop him.

On December 18, 2007, the Denver Broncos released Sauerbrun for a second time after he was arrested by Denver police during an altercation with a taxi driver.

Sauerbrun was signed by the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League on September 9, 2009.

<doc id="1302245" wikidata="Q7933902" url="?curid=1302245" title="Virgin CrossCountry">
<text>Virgin CrossCountry was a train operating company in the United Kingdom that operated the InterCity CrossCountry passenger franchise from January 1997 until November 2007. Along with the InterCity West Coast franchise held by a separate legal entity, the company traded under the Virgin Trains brand.

Operations commenced on 5 January 1997 as part of the privatisation of British Rail. Originally scheduled to run for 15 years, the franchise was suspended in favour of a management contract in July 2002. The government opted to retender the CrossCountry franchise during the late 2000s and services were transferred over to Arriva-owned CrossCountry on 11 November 2007.

Virgin CrossCountry operated some of the longest direct rail services in the United Kingdom, but most avoided Greater London entirely as a result of changes in 2003. All of its services called, or terminated, at Birmingham New Street. Multiple service reorganisations, such as Project Princess and Project Omega, were implemented by the company. In order to replace its British Rail-era rolling stock, the company introduced Class 220 &quot;Voyagers&quot; and Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot;.

==History==

Amid the privatisation of British Rail during the mid 1990s, the newly formed Virgin Rail Group submitted multiple bids to operate several different train franchises, including Gatwick Express, InterCity CrossCountry and InterCity West Coast. It was successful in winning the latter two, both scheduled to run for 15 years, leading to the creation of Virgin CrossCountry and Virgin West Coast: During November 1996, it was announced that Virgin had been awarded the InterCity CrossCountry franchise. Services were operated by a wholly owned subsidiary, CrossCountry Trains Limited. The company commenced operations on 5 January 1997.

In October 1998, Virgin Group sold 49% of the shares in Virgin Rail Group to Stagecoach.

Virgin sought to introduce new tilting trains upon some of its services; however, their introduction was repeatedly delayed as a consequence of poor project management by the national railway infrastructure owner of the era, Railtrack. Infrastructure changes were required to make effective use of tilting trains and, while Railtrack had committed itself to performing such upgrades on the West Coast Main Line as to permit 140 mph operation by 2005, the modernisation programme soon suffered from spiralling costs, as well as technical failures such as the moving block signalling apparatus sought being immature for the intended use at that time. Railtrack would ultimately collapse in 2002 while its successor, Network Rail, would also be unable to fully deliver the promised upgrade, heavily impacting Virgin&#x27;s operations.

In the wake of the collapse of Railtrack and the inability of Network Rail to fully deliver on promised improvements, both the Virgin CrossCountry and Virgin West Coast franchises were suspended in favour of management contracts in July 2002. While the terms of the West Coast franchise were renegotiated, an agreement could not be reached on CrossCountry, and it was thus retendered during the late 2000s. Virgin Trains were keen to retain the franchise, and submitted a bid in response along with several other interested parties.

During September 2006, the Department for Transport announced the shortlist for the New CrossCountry franchise, which included Virgin Rail Group. In October 2006, the DfT issued the invitation to tender (ITT) to the four shortlisted bidders: Arriva, FirstGroup, National Express and Virgin Rail Group. On 10 July 2007, the Department for Transport awarded the new CrossCountry franchise to Arriva; accordingly, the services operated by Virgin CrossCountry were transferred over to the newly created operator, named CrossCountry, on 11 November 2007.

==Services==
In May 1998, Virgin introduced new services from Portsmouth Harbour to Liverpool Lime Street and Blackpool North. The Summer Saturday service to Ramsgate ran for the last time in September 1999. The Summer Saturday services to Weymouth ran for the last time in September 2002.

===Operation Princess===
In September 2002, Virgin Trains launched &quot;Operation Princess&quot;. This involved introducing a new clockface timetable with shorter trains running more frequently. However, the new fleet suffered from a number of technical faults which, coupled with infrastructure and capacity issues, led to many problems. Between September 2002 and January 2003, punctuality fell to 54.1%, it was therefore agreed with the Strategic Rail Authority that certain services would be cut to improve reliability and robustness on the core network.

When &quot;Operation Princess&quot; was launched in September 2002, Virgin CrossCountry served these destinations:

===Project Omega===

Project Omega was a project which would have seen a series of improvements following the West Coast modernisation. This included Virgin CrossCountry running services from to Teesside via and and another service from to via for Heathrow. These services would have been run by the Class 220. The project also involved extending Virgin&#x27;s West Coast and CrossCountry franchises by 5 years (both originally planned to end in 2012, so would have been 2017) as well as adding a fifth car to 38 Voyagers.

By the time Virgin Trains lost the CrossCountry franchise to Arriva in 2007, the network consisted of only the following routes:

==Rolling stock==

Virgin CrossCountry inherited a fleet of Class 47 and Class 86 locomotives, Mark 2 Carriages, High Speed Trains and Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; diesel multiple units from British Rail. Class 47s on hire from English Welsh &amp; Scottish and Fragonset were also fairly common.

A franchise commitment was the replacement of these trains with new stock. In December 1998 Virgin signed a deal to lease 78 &quot;Voyager&quot; diesel–electric multiple units built by Bombardier Transportation, consisting of 34 four-carriage Class 220 &quot;Voyagers&quot; and 40 five-carriage and four four-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot;. The Super Voyagers were built with tilting mechanisms to enable higher speeds on curved tracks, including on the West Coast Main Line and between Oxford and Banbury. The four-carriage Super Voyagers were intended for use by Virgin West Coast on services from London Euston to Holyhead, although they ended up being pooled with the other Voyagers. When Virgin West Coast started using Super Voyagers on Holyhead services in September 2004, the five-carriage units were used.

The first Class 220 Voyager arrived from Belgium in January 2001 and entered service on 21 May 2001. The last Class 47s, Class 86s and Mark 2 carriages were withdrawn in August 2002, while the Express Sprinters were transferred to Wessex Trains and First TransPennine Express.

After experiencing rapid growth Virgin CrossCountry decided to retain some High Speed Train sets. During December 2001, it announced plans to refurbish eight HSTs as &quot;Virgin Challengers&quot; for use on proposed services from London Paddington to Manchester Piccadilly via Cheltenham, with the option to refurbish more. In the wake of the collapse of &quot;Operation Princess&quot;, the project was cancelled with the remaining HSTs withdrawn in September 2003 on the instruction of the Strategic Rail Authority.

To provide extra stock for services on summer Saturday services to Paignton and Newquay, Virgin CrossCountry hired HSTs from Virgin West Coast, Midland Mainline and Great North Eastern Railway (GNER), and Mark 3B loco-hauled carriages from Virgin West Coast. In 2004, Virgin hired Class 67 locomotives from EWS and Mark 2 carriages from Riviera Trains to operate summer Saturday services to Paignton.

A standby set of Mark 2 carriages was leased from Riviera Trains from September 2004. This set was usually used with an EWS Class 90 locomotive between Birmingham New Street and Manchester Piccadilly, although it did run to Newcastle with a Class 57/3 in January 2007.

HSTs were hired from Midland Mainline and GNER on a number of occasions to operate services from Edinburgh Waverley to Plymouth when Voyagers were unavailable.

<text>Arthur Liebehenschel (; 25 November 1901 – 24 January 1948) was a German commandant at the Auschwitz and Majdanek concentration camps during the Holocaust. After the war, he was convicted of war crimes by the Polish government and executed in 1948.

==Early life==
Liebehenschel was born on 25 November 1901 in Posen (now Poznań). He studied economics and public administration. Too young to serve in World War I, Liebehenschel enrolled in the &quot;Freikorps &quot;Grenzschutz Ost&quot;&quot; in 1919. He also served as a sergeant major in the German armed forces (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;) afterwards.

== SS career ==
In 1932, Liebehenschel joined the Nazi Party and in 1934 the SS, where he served in the &quot;Death&#x27;s Head Units&quot;. Liebehenschel became the adjutant in the Lichtenburg concentration camp, and two years later was transferred to the Concentration Camps Inspectorate in Berlin. In 1942, when the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office was founded, Liebehenschel was assigned to the Department D (Concentration Camps) as head of DI (Central Office).

On 1 December 1943, Liebehenschel was appointed commandant of Auschwitz I concentration camp, succeeding Rudolf Höss. While continuing mass executions, he made some minor &quot;improvements&quot; including removing the standing cells and halting the selections to gas chambers among regular prisoners. According to Hermann Langbein, a prisoner at Auschwitz infirmary: &quot;in general one could establish that even those SS members who were very bloodthirsty before became a bit more reserved because they realized that their fanaticism would not necessarily be tolerated anymore.&quot; 

On 8 May 1944, Höss returned to Auschwitz, replacing Liebehenschel, who was appointed commandant of the already emptied Majdanek camp on 19 May, succeeding Martin Gottfried Weiss. The camp was evacuated because of the Soviet advance into German-occupied Poland. Liebehenschel relocated to Trieste, Italy to the office of Odilo Globocnik, the SS and Police Leader for Operational Zone Adriatic Coast (OZAK). Liebehenschel became head of the SS Manpower Office there.

==Criminal conviction==

At the war&#x27;s end, Liebehenschel was arrested by the U.S. Army and extradited to Poland. After being convicted of crimes against humanity at the Auschwitz Trial in Kraków, he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed by hanging on 24 January 1948.

==Family==
Liebehenschel had one son and three daughters by his first wife, Gertrud, the youngest of whom, Barbara Cherish (born 1943), now lives in the United States. 

In 2009, Cherish published her book &quot;My Father, the Auschwitz Commandant&quot;, in which she outlined actions by Liebehenschel that improved the prisoners&#x27; lives, but also discussed his participation in a genocidal system. Together with another daughter, Antje, Cherish was interviewed in 2002 by ZDF, the German television channel, about living with their father&#x27;s guilt. Liebehenschel had a son by his second wife, Anneliese. Liebehenschel&#x27;s first wife, whom he left during the war, suffered from mental health issues after the war and committed suicide in a hospital for the mentally ill in 1966.

<text>Rae Theotis Carruth (born Rae Lamar Wiggins; January 20, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. He played as a wide receiver for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). Carruth played college football for the Colorado Buffaloes, earning first-team All-American honors in 1996. He was selected by the Panthers in the first round of the 1997 NFL draft and spent three seasons with the team.

In 2001, he was found guilty of conspiring the murder of his then-girlfriend Cherica Adams, who was pregnant with his child. Including pre-trial confinement, he served 18 years of an 18-to-24-year sentence in the North Carolina state prison system and was released from the Sampson Correctional Institution in Clinton, North Carolina, on October 22, 2018.

== Early life ==
Born and raised in Sacramento, California, Carruth attended Valley High School. He was accepted on a football scholarship to the University of Colorado Boulder, in Boulder, Colorado.

==College career==
He played four seasons for the Buffaloes and was named a first-team All-American in 1996. His quarterbacks at CU were future pros Koy Detmer and Kordell Stewart. Carruth earned his degree with a double major in English and education. Carruth caught 135 passes for 2,540 yards and 11 touchdowns in his four seasons, with an average of 18.8 yards per catch.

==Professional career==
Carruth was a first-round draft pick in the 1997 NFL draft, taken by the Carolina Panthers with the 27th overall selection. He signed a four-year, $3.7 million deal that included a $1.3 million signing bonus.

Carruth had a rookie season in 1997 and started 14 games, during which he caught 44 passes for 545 yards and four touchdown passes, tied for first among rookie receivers. He was named to the all-rookie team at wide receiver.

He broke his right foot in the opening game of 1998, and did not catch another pass that season due to the injury. He ended the year with four catches for 59 yards (all on opening day). He played in the first five games of the 1999 season, with 14 catches for 200 yards.

==Personal life==
During Carruth&#x27;s sophomore year at Colorado, his girlfriend, Michelle Wright, gave birth to their son Rae Jr. Wright sued him for child support, and Wright later testified that Carruth agreed to pay $2,700 in child support, half of what he was ordered to pay by a judge, and she had accepted on condition that he be a better father.

===Crimes===
On November 16, 1999, near Carruth&#x27;s home in Charlotte, North Carolina, Cherica Adams, a real estate agent he had been dating, was shot four times using a .357 caliber Charter Arms revolver by Van Brett Watkins Sr., a nightclub manager and an associate of Carruth. Adams managed to call 911, and said that Carruth had stopped his vehicle in front of hers, and that another vehicle drove alongside and its passenger had shot her. Carruth then drove away from the scene.

Adams was eight months pregnant with Carruth&#x27;s child at the time. Soon after her admission to the hospital, she fell into a coma. Doctors delivered the baby via emergency caesarean section. Carruth went to the police and posted $3 million bail, on condition that if either Adams or the infant died, he would turn himself in. Adams died on December 14, 1999. The baby, named Chancellor Lee Adams, survived, but suffered permanent brain damage and cerebral palsy as a result of being without oxygen for 70 minutes before he was born. Chancellor Lee graduated from Vance High School in 2021 at age 21.

Carruth quickly fled after Adams&#x27; death, but was captured on December 15 in West Tennessee, found hiding in the trunk of a car outside a motel in Parkers Crossroads. The trunk also contained $3,900 cash, bottles of his urine, extra clothes, candy bars, and a cell phone. The Panthers waived him on December 16, citing a morals clause in his contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely on December 17.

At trial, prosecutors contended that Carruth hired Watkins and others to murder Adams because of her refusal to abort their unborn child. Carruth&#x27;s lawyer David Rudolf claimed that Carruth had been caught up in a drug deal gone bad. They claimed that on the night of the shooting, after Carruth had refused to fund the drug deal, Watkins shot Adams in a sudden rage when she &quot;flipped him off&quot; after he had attempted to ask her about Carruth&#x27;s whereabouts.

Carruth was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, shooting into an occupied vehicle, and using an instrument to destroy an unborn child. He was found not guilty of first degree murder, sparing him from possible execution. Carruth was sentenced to 18 years and 11 months to 24 years and 4 months in prison.

Watkins was sentenced to prison for a minimum of 40 years, 8 months and a maximum 50 years, 8 months for the murder of Cherica Adams. He was last housed at Scotland CI in Laurinburg, North Carolina, and died on December 3, 2023.

Carruth sent a letter in 2018 apologizing to Saundra Adams, the mother of Cherica Adams, via WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina, for accusing her of lying about him in interviews for years.

Carruth was released on October 22, 2018, after serving 18 years. He moved to Pennsylvania after his release. He is now married and resides in southwestern USA.

<text>Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (Welsh for &quot;cave of the black spring&quot;), also known informally as OFD, is a cave under a hillside in the area surrounding Penwyllt in the Upper Swansea Valley in South Wales. It is the second longest cave in Wales and the deepest in the United Kingdom.

==History==
OFD was discovered in 1946 through digging by Peter Harvey and Ian Nixon, members of the newly formed South Wales Caving Club. Exploration beyond the Boulder Chamber in 1957 revealed passages as far as the Dip Sump. Major extensions were discovered in 1967 through to Cwm Dŵr, which is now known as OFD2. The system is famous for its intricate maze-like structure and its impressive main stream passage.

It is now part of the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu National Nature Reserve, which includes the ruined remains of a former brickworks, including several kilns, quarry workings and tramroad tracks. The terrace of workers&#x27; cottages is now occupied by the South Wales Caving Club.

The cave has seen many minor incidents resulting from people getting lost or tired, or surprised by flooding, and various accidents such as falls which are handled by volunteer cave rescue teams who are alerted by the police. More prolonged rescues have included:

In 1951, before cave rescue was well established, &quot;two well-known members of the South Wales Caving Club, Lewis Railton and W.H.Little, made their way into the huge cave that bears the Welsh name of Ogof-Y Ffynnon Ddu (Cave of the Black Well or Stream) in South Wales...[when] swirling water cut off their escape...a rescue party including soldiers from Senny Bridge, men of the R.A.F., and thirty miners set to work to divert the stream above the point where it goes underground...they were brought out into the open air after being trapped for fifty-nine hours...&quot;

In 2021 the cave was the site of the next longest cave rescue undertaken in the UK, after George Linnane, a 38-year-old experienced caver, fell and sustained multiple injuries on 6 November, from the lower Cwm Dŵr entrance. Almost 250 people were involved in the rescue, which was organised by the South and Mid Wales Cave Rescue Team and involved manually hauling the casualty by stretcher, using relay teams of rescuers, to the top entrance. Linnane was rescued on the evening of 8 November, after 57 hours; the previous longest rescue was 41 hours.

==The cave system==
With a depth of and a length of at least , it is the deepest cave in the UK and the second-longest in Wales. The passages and chambers of Ogof Ffynnon Ddu weave a tortuous path beneath the east side of the Tawe Valley. The stream passage cuts through black limestone producing waterfalls, rapids, deep potholes and scalloped walls. The system is divided into three parts: the lowermost (western) section is referred to as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu I (or simply OFD I), the central section as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu II (or OFD II) and the uppermost (eastern) section as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu III (or OFD III).

A variety of specialised wildlife has developed underground including cave shrimps and the pale blanched trout endemic to pure underground fresh water courses with sufficient plankton. Deep cracks in the vast expanse of stony moorland above provide habitats for plant life, including the lily of the valley and wood anemone, and mossy saxifrage (&quot;Saxifraga hypnoides&quot;) grows on the limestone outcrops.

==National Nature Reserve (NNR)==
The name Ogof Ffynnon Ddu has also been applied to an extensive tract of moorland, rocks and cave systems of which the eponymous cave is a part. It was designated as an NNR because of its unique geology, floristic diversity, its industrial past and its subterranean animal and plant life.

<text>Betty Smith (11 December 1921 – 24 December 2016), known by the stage name Liz Smith, was an English actress known for her roles in BBC sitcoms, including as Annie Brandon in &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know You Cared&quot; (1975–1979), the sisters Bette and Belle in &quot;2point4 Children&quot; (1991–1999), Letitia Cropley in &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; (1994–1996) and Norma (&quot;Nana&quot;) in &quot;The Royle Family&quot; (1998–2006). For the latter she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Comedy Performance in 2007. She also played Zillah in &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot; (2008) and won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Mother in the film &quot;A Private Function&quot; (1984).

==Early life==
Smith was born Betty Gleadle in 1921 in the Crosby area of Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. Her mother died when she was two; her father remarried, but his new wife did not wish him to have any contact with his previous life. As a result, she was brought up by her widowed grandmother and attended Crosby Junior School and the Scunthorpe Modern and Day Commercial Schools in Cole Street. During the Second World War, she served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service of the Royal Navy.

==Career==
===Early roles===
In 1971, aged 49, Smith had a career breakthrough when she appeared as the downtrodden mother in Mike Leigh&#x27;s film &quot;Bleak Moments&quot;:

Smith starred in &quot;It&#x27;s a Lovely Day Tomorrow&quot;, written by Bernard Kops and directed by John Goldschmidt, which depicted the real-life drama of the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster during World War II. A role in &quot;Hard Labour&quot; followed. After that she appeared in &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (as Hilda Semple), &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot;, &quot;Crown Court&quot;, &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know You Cared&quot; and &quot;The Sweeney&quot;. She also appeared as Madame Balls in &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; (1976), but her scenes were deleted and remained unseen until &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; in 1982. She was seen in &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; (1983), and later &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; (1993) in the same role. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, Smith appeared in many UK television programmes, including &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot;, &quot;Within These Walls&quot;, &quot;In Loving Memory&quot;, &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot;, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Partners in Crime&quot;, &quot;The Life and Loves of a She-Devil&quot;, &quot;One by One&quot; as Gran Turner and &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot;. In 1984, Liz Smith received a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the mother of Maggie Smith&#x27;s character in &quot;A Private Function&quot;.

In 1980, Smith won a role in &quot;Sir Henry at Rawlinson End&quot; as Lady Philippa of Staines. She later appeared in the thriller, &quot;Apartment Zero&quot;, which was featured in the 1988 Sundance Film Festival. Smith played the role of one of two eccentric characters (the other is Dora Bryan) described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as two &quot;... tea-and-crumpet gargoyle-featured spinsters who snoop the corridors.&quot; also had a part in Lovejoy 1eps

===1990s===
Smith started the 1990s by appearing in &quot;2point4 Children&quot; (as &quot;Aunt Belle&quot; and &quot;Bette&quot;), &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Lovejoy&quot;. In 1994, she played the lead role in the Children&#x27;s BBC series &quot;Pirates&quot; and the supporting role of Letitia Cropley for seven episodes in &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;. In the 1996 Easter Special episode the character died.

In November 1995 she made a guest appearance in the BBC1 medical drama series &quot;Casualty&quot;. In 1996 she had a cameo appearance in the Mike Leigh film &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; and in 1998 starred in the TV sitcom &quot;The Royle Family&quot;. This aired until 2000, but came back for a special episode in 2006 when her character, Nana, died. In the meantime, she had appeared in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Nose&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;. In 1999 Smith was featured in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; as Mrs Dilber. She portrayed that same character in the 1984 version and also appeared as Miss Lory in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
Smith continued to act until ill-health beset her in 2009, appearing in such TV programmes as &quot;Trial &amp; Retribution V&quot; and &quot;Doctors&quot;. In 2005, she played Grandma Georgina in the film &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and provided the voice of Mrs. Mulch in &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, as well as small roles in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and &quot;Keeping Mum&quot;. In 2001, she appeared as herself in &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;.

In 2006 Smith published her autobiography &quot;Our Betty&quot; and around the same time, moved to a retirement home in Hampstead, London. In 2007, she published a series of short stories entitled &quot;Jottings: Flights of Fancy&quot; and appeared in the Little Man Tate music video &quot;This Must Be Love&quot;. On 5 December 2007, Smith won the Best Television Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards for her role in &quot;The Royle Family&quot;. The 2006 episode &quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot; takes place six years after the events of the previous series and features Nana&#x27;s declining health and death. It won the Best Sitcom award at the 2007 BAFTAs, and won the Royal Television Society Award for Best Situation Comedy &amp; Comedy Drama.

In 2006 she made a cameo appearance in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s film &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, a version in English of the Mozart opera. However, her role did not require her to sing. She portrayed Old Papagena who, later on in the film, magically transforms into Young Papagena (played by soprano Silvia Moi) and marries the birdcatcher Papageno (played by baritone Benjamin Jay Davis).

In 2008 she starred in the first series of the period drama &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot;. That same year she was a castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; and was in the film &quot;City of Ember&quot;, which was released in October 2008. In July 2009, she featured in a one-hour BBC Four documentary called &quot;Liz Smith&#x27;s Summer Cruise&quot;, where she joined a group of like-minded individuals on a cruise from Croatia to Venice. That same month, having suffered a series of strokes a few months earlier, she announced her retirement from acting at the age of 87.

Smith was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours.

In 2010 she took part in the BBC television programme &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, in which six celebrities in their 70s and 80s attempted to overcome some of the problems of ageing by harking back to the 1970s.

==Personal life and death==
In 1945, Smith married Jack Thomas, whom she met while on service in India. They had two children but divorced in 1959. Smith brought up her son and daughter on her own. She described this as an extremely difficult period in her life, as she struggled against financial problems and social disapproval of her status as a divorcée.

Smith died on 24 December 2016 at her home in Worthing, West Sussex, shortly after her 95th birthday. Shane Allen, controller of BBC comedy commissioning, said that Smith had &quot;brilliantly captured the grandparent in everyone&#x27;s family&quot; as Nana in &quot;The Royle Family.&quot; Mike Leigh said &quot;She was a complete breath of fresh air... she was not your bog standard middle-aged actress.&quot; The final episode of the lockdown edition of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; ended with a tribute just before the closing credits reading, &quot;In loving memory of Liz, John, Emma and Roger&quot;, paying tribute to her and also three other deceased &quot;Dibley&quot; cast members (John Bluthal, Emma Chambers and Roger Lloyd-Pack).

<text>Gregory Alexander Van Pelt (born May 1, 1970) is an American professional football coach and former quarterback who currently serves as a senior offensive assistant with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League. He played in the NFL primarily with the Buffalo Bills. Van Pelt previously served as an assistant coach for the Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots.

==Playing career==
===College===
Van Pelt attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he was a 4-year starting quarterback for the Panthers. When he graduated, Van Pelt broke school career passing records previously set by Dan Marino, holding records for most career passing yards, completions, and attempts in Pitt history. His single-season mark of 3,163 passing yards in 1992 was broken in 2003 by Rod Rutherford.

*1989: 192/347 for 2,881 yards with 17 touchdowns vs 12 interceptions. Ran for 4 touchdowns.
*1990: 201/351 for 2,427 yards with 14 touchdowns vs 17 interceptions. Ran for 2 touchdowns.
*1991: 227/398 for 2,796 yards with 15 touchdowns vs 14 interceptions. Ran for 1 touchdown.
*1992: 245/407 for 3,163 yards with 20 touchdowns vs 17 interceptions.

===Professional===
Van Pelt was an eighth round draft pick of his hometown franchise Pittsburgh Steelers, but was released during training camp. Van Pelt spent three games with the Kansas City Chiefs late in the 1993 NFL season following a hamstring injury to Joe Montana. He was re-signed by the Chiefs prior to the 1994 NFL season, but was released during training camp. He was signed by the Buffalo Bills later in the 1994 season following a knee injury sustained by Jim Kelly and spent the remainder of his career as a backup with the Bills.

Van Pelt&#x27;s first NFL win as a starter would come on November 2, 1997, against Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins. In 2001, he started eight games, going 2–6, and playing well enough to justify a contract extension that would allow the Bills to release failed Jim Kelly successor Todd Collins. Van Pelt would not start any games after 2001 due to a Bills trade with the New England Patriots for Drew Bledsoe, who became the full-time starting quarterback. Van Pelt remained with the team as Bledsoe&#x27;s backup for the next two seasons before retiring.

In his eleven-year career, Van Pelt totaled 16 touchdowns and 24 interceptions on 477 pass attempts in 31 career appearances and 11 starts.

==Broadcasting career==
After retiring from football in 2004, Van Pelt was John Murphy&#x27;s partner on Bills Radio Network broadcasts. He did color commentary for the radio broadcast of all Bills games during the 2004 season.

==Coaching career==

<doc id="1302279" wikidata="Q4108155" url="?curid=1302279" title="Antowain Smith">
<text>Antowain Drurell Smith (born March 14, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL), most notably with the New England Patriots, with whom he won two Super Bowls, and the Buffalo Bills. At 6&#x27;2&quot;, 232 pounds, Smith&#x27;s powerful running style made him an effective runner between the tackles.

==Early life==
Smith attended Stanhope Elmore High School in Millbrook, Alabama and played football only in his senior year.

==College career==
Smith worked in a factory for two years before enrolling at East Mississippi Junior College in 1993. At East Mississippi, Smith was a JUCO All-American running back. In 1995, Smith transferred to the University of Houston and played two seasons on the Houston Cougars football team at running back. In 21 games with Houston, Smith rushed for 1,847 yards and 19 touchdowns. Among records set by Smith include the longest touchdown in school history at 96 yards and six touchdowns in one game.

In his senior season, Smith rushed for 1,239 yards and 14 touchdowns, while also catching 28 passes for 201 yards and another score.

==Professional career==
Antowain Smith was drafted in the first round of the 1997 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills. In his rookie season Smith ran for 840 yards and 8 touchdowns with also catching 28 passes. The next season Smith ran for 1,124 yards and again scored 8 times, although his yards per carry dropped from 4.3 to 3.7. Smith gained just 27 total yards in the Bills first round playoff loss in 1998. The next season was disappointing and saw Smith score 6 times while rushing for just 614 yards. He did manage to run for 79 yards and two scores in the Bill&#x27;s first round playoff game but the Bills still lost to the Titans. Having fallen out of favor with the coaching staff Smith ran for just 354 yards and 4 touchdowns in 2000.

The next season Smith rejuvenated his professional career when he joined the New England Patriots. He ran for 1,157 yards and 12 touchdowns in the regular season. He also ran for 204 yards in the playoffs as the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI. The iconic moment of him being the first Patriot to run onto the field after Adam Vinatieri kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired is what Smith is remembered for the most in his career. Smith&#x27;s numbers dropped off a bit in 2002 as he ran for 982 yards and 6 touchdowns. He did get more involved in the passing game however, and caught 31 balls including 2 touchdowns. 2003 was Smith&#x27;s final season in New England and he managed just 642 yards, although he still led the team in rushing. His play improved in the playoffs that year as he ran for 252 yards and 2 scores as Smith and the Patriots won their second Super Bowl championship, Super Bowl XXXVIII.

Smith joined the Titans for 2004 and he ran for 509 yards. It was the only season in his career in which he failed to record a single 100 yard game. Smith played his final NFL season in 2005, with the New Orleans Saints, running for 659 yards and 3 scores. For his career Smith played in 131 games, running for 6,881 yards and 54 touchdowns, good for 50th and 44th on the all-time lists respectively.

<doc id="1302280" wikidata="Q1140657" url="?curid=1302280" title="Cro-Mags">
<text>The Cro-Mags are an American hardcore punk band from New York City. The band, which has garnered a strong cult following, has released six studio albums, with the first two considered the most influential. With a Hare Krishna background, they were among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal.

Harley Flanagan, who co-founded the Cro-Mags, reached a settlement in April 2019 with former singer John Joseph and former drummer Mackie Jayson. Under the terms of the agreement, Flanagan retained exclusive rights to the Cro-Mags name, while Joseph and Jayson would continue performing under the name Cro-Mags&quot;JM&quot; until september of 2022.

==History==
===Early years (1980–1985)===
How the Cro-Mags formed is disputed by the band&#x27;s founding members. In Tony Rettman&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;NYHC: New York Hardcore 1980-1990&quot;, guitarist Parris Mayhew states that the band formed after he had put up a number of posters around New York in search of band members, to which Flanagan responded. In the same book, other people involved in the New York hardcore scene suggest that the band formed under the name Mode of Ignorance, with an original lineup consisting of Dave Hahn on drums, Mayhew and Dave Stein on guitar, John Joseph on lead vocals and Flanagan on bass. During its early existence, the band went through frequent lineup changes. Mayhew explains that this was because &quot;Harley would see some kid with a shaved head and think &#x27;This kid is hard... let&#x27;s bring him into the band.&#x27; Then I would end up tolerating some horrible, talentless person for however long it took Harley to realise that the guy had no talent&quot;. Joseph left the band soon after to live in Puerto Rico and then Hawaii, and was replaced by Eric Casanova. One Cro-Mags lineup from this time consisted of Flanagan on drums, Mayhew on guitar, Todd Youth on bass and Casanova on vocals. By the time the band played their first live performance, Youth had been replaced by Roger Miret, however soon after Casanova was kicked out of the band due to the birth of his son interfering with scheduling. By this time, Joseph had returned to New York and so rejoined as the band&#x27;s vocalist. Youth briefly rejoined the band after Miret&#x27;s departure, at the same time Robb &quot;Nunzio&quot; Ortiz joined as an additional guitarist. A few months later, the band changed their name to the Cro-Mags.

However, Flanagan claims in his 2016 autobiography &quot;Hard-Core: Life of My Own&quot; that he and Mayhew met in 1980 after being introduced by Paul Dordal, they began writing music together soon after and formed the band with vocalist Eric Casanova, who only performed with the band twice. Following this, they would go on hiatus as Flanagan went to California then Canada, during which time he wrote and recorded demos for the songs &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gonna Die&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread On Me&quot;, &quot;By Myself&quot; and &quot;Do Unto Others&quot;. After returning to New York in 1983, he regrouped the band and he, Mayhew and Casanova began writing again, using his demo tracks as a basis.

Flanagan also claimed in a 2018 interview with Blabbermouth.net that he formed the Cro-Mags in 1980 with guitarist Dave Stein, drummer Dave Hahn and vocalist John Berry and that the band&#x27;s first performance was at the Peppermint Lounge opening for the Stimulators the same year. He thought the band was not ready to debut using their real name, so instead performed as Disco Smoothy. After this performance, the group disbanded and in 1982–1983, Flanagan recorded four tracks in Songshop Studios in New York City with Denise Mercedes of the Stimulators, the tracks set to be released by Rat Cage Records but issues regarding management prevented the project to come to fruition. He then recruited Eric Casanova on vocals, before meeting Parris Mayhew in 1983, who then joined as guitarist, along with drummer Mackie Jayson. This final story by Flanagan is supported by John Joseph in his 2007 autobiography &quot;The Evolution of a Cro-Magnon&quot;, however Joseph instead states the band formed in 1981 and that he was the band&#x27;s vocalist prior to Berry but left prior to the Peppermint Lounge performance because he thought the name they were performing under was not serious enough.

===Rising popularity, lineup changes and breakup (1986–2002)===
The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Age of Quarrel&quot; was released in 1986, which was mostly written by Parris Mayhew and Flanagan, some songs being based on a four track demo that Flanagan had recorded solo in 1982 while on the West Coast. Joseph parted ways with the band again after &quot;The Age of Quarrel&quot;, leaving Flanagan to sing on the second Cro-Mags album, &quot;Best Wishes&quot; (1989), which had a more heavy metal-influenced sound. The next album, &quot;Alpha Omega&quot; (1992), saw the return of Joseph singing along with Flanagan. According to cofounder Parris Mayhew, he wrote most of the album with guitarist Rob Buckley. However, neither Mayhew or Buckley played on the actual recording, and the writing has been disputed by Flanagan and others. The Cro-Mags disbanded but later recorded the album with the return of Doug Holland and a new rhythm guitarist, Gabby Abularach.

The album, &quot;Near Death Experience&quot; was released in 1993, after which the group disbanded for several years. They began touring again in the late 1990s with Flanagan on vocals and bass and Mayhew returning to the fold. Eventually, the band released &quot;Revenge&quot; in 2000. For many fans, this album signified a return to the Cro-Mags&#x27; early hardcore roots. Many songs were comparable to those on &quot;The Age of Quarrel&quot;, although some featured a more melodic/punk rock style. The release of &quot;Revenge&quot; and its subsequent tour resulted in yet another break up, which caused lasting resentment between Mayhew and Flanagan. In 2001 Flanagan asked Joseph to join him once again, but the short-lived reunion ended in 2002.

===Reunion and legal battle over name ownership (2008–2019)===

In 2008, John Joseph and Jayson began playing shows under the Cro-Mags name with other established hardcore musicians such as Craig Setari from Sick of It All on bass and A.J. Novello from Leeway on guitar. In an October 2010 interview, Joseph revealed that they were planning to release a new album in 2011. This album never happened, as Joseph did not have the legal right to release music using the trademarked name Cro-Mags.

In 2018, Flanagan filed a federal trademark infringement suit against John Joseph and Mackie Jayson in the Southern District of New York. In April 2019, Flanagan announced a settlement wherein he would own exclusive rights to the name Cro-Mags; simultaneously, Joseph announced his recognition of the settlement, and that he and his band would perform as the Cro-Mags JM, having been granted a limited license to use the name in this manner, beginning in August 2019. Later infringement by Joseph in 2022 resulted in a permanent injunction granted by the Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York. The rights to the Cro-Mags name now belong exclusively to Flanagan.

===Cro-Mags today (2019–present)===
On June 28, 2019, the Cro-Mags released their first new music in nineteen years, while heading into a 5-show run with the Misfits sharing three new songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Give In&quot;, &quot;Drag You Under&quot;, and &quot;No One&#x27;s Victim&quot;, and toured in North America and Europe. The line-up consisted of Flanagan on bass and vocals, Abulurach on guitar, Rocky George on lead guitar and long time drummer Garry &quot;G-Man&quot; Sullivan on drums.

At the end of 2019, they released &quot;From the Grave&quot; featuring former Motörhead guitarist Phil Campbell on lead and slide guitar. A three-song 7-inch EP of the same name was released on December 6, 2019, in various colors and have the tracks &quot;PTSD&quot; and &quot;Between Wars&quot; included. The band was set to perform with Body Count in New York City on March 15 at Webster Hall. The show was postponed due to the COVID-19 virus. The band decided to live stream a free performance from SIR studios, one of the first bands to do so during the pandemic. On March 31, 2020, the band offered a free download of the track, &quot;The Final Test&quot; and announced the June 19 release date of their first studio album in twenty years, &quot;In the Beginning&quot;.

In July 2022, Flanagan announced that the Cro-Mags were working on new material for their next album.

<text>The Peace–Athabasca Delta, located in northeast Alberta, is the largest freshwater inland river delta in North America. It is located partially within the southeast corner of Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada&#x27;s largest national park, and also spreads into the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, west and south of the historical community of Fort Chipewyan. The delta encompasses approximately , formed where the Peace and Athabasca rivers converge on the Slave River and Lake Athabasca. The delta region is designated a wetland of international importance and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region is large enough that it is considered one of twenty distinct natural subregions of Alberta by the provincial government&#x27;s Natural Regions Committee.

==History==
Land use and occupation by the first indigenous people in the area can be traced to the retreat of the glaciers. The descendants of the Cree and Chipewyan First Nations continue to carry on traditional fishing, hunting and trapping activities. It is &quot;the longest standing tradition of native subsistence use.&quot; Based on excavations in the 1980s at the Peace Point and Lake One Dune (IgPc-9) sites, archaeologist Marc Stevenson argued that the area around Peace Point has been occupied by boreal forest-related and plains-related northern hunter-gatherer groups of people &quot;at intervals over the last 7000-8000 years.&quot;

In 1922, Wood Buffalo National Park was established to protect the remnant population of wood bison that escaped the slaughter in the late 19th century. It became the world&#x27;s largest herd of free roaming wood bison, estimated at more than 5,000. It is one of two known nesting sites of whooping cranes.

In the late 1960s, the W.A.C. Bennett Dam was constructed on the Peace River in northern British Columbia by BC Hydro, a major hydropower utility. Between 1968 and 1971, &quot;after the construction and initial filling of the W.A.C. Bennett hydroelectric dam at the headwaters of the Peace River&quot;, the Peace–Athabasca delta experienced a &quot;prolonged dry period&quot; that turned some basins from aquatic into terrestrial ecosystems.

In 1974, a major flood occurred in the region and, when the spring water receded, the delta experienced a second prolonged dry period.

On 24 May 1982, the Peace–Athabasca Delta region was designated by the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance. The Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands, was created to &quot;stem the progressive encroachment on and loss of wetlands now and in the future&quot;. They recognize the &quot;fundamental ecological functions of wetlands&quot; that support a &quot;characteristic flora and fauna, particularly waterfowl&quot; and the economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value of wetlands. The reasons for this designation as internationally significant are,

In 1983, Peace–Athabasca Delta was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the world&#x27;s largest freshwater deltas, for its biological diversity and for the population of wild bison.

In 1986, Ducks Unlimited (Canada) and Alberta Energy and Natural Resources Fish and Wildlife Division proposed &quot;the portion of the delta lying outside Wood Buffalo National Park, with the exception of the Chipewyan Indian Reserves, as a Wildlife Habitat Management Area.

By the 1990s, the National Water Research Institute was involved in a provincial-territorial-federal initiative, the Northern River Basins Study, and was conducting research on the hydro-climatology and ecology of the Peace–Athabasca Delta. They investigated potential impact on the delta&#x27;s productivity and biodiversity if the climate were to change.

In the spring of 2006, BC Hydro dam managers released an agreed upon timed flow into the delta under appropriate hydrological and climatic conditions thereby increasing the magnitude of an ice-jam flood, producing the first major flood since c. 1986 and bringing restorative water to areas that had been dry since c.1986.

In June 2009, the Peace–Athabasca Delta Environmental Monitoring Program (PADEMP) held their first official meeting in Fort Smith with 17 groups participating, including federal, provincial and territorial governments and ten First Nations directly affected by the Peace–Athabasca Delta. PADEMP chair, Stuart Macmillan representing Parks Canada, observed that, &quot;I think everybody realizes if we don’t do this now, we’re in danger of losing something very special in the delta. The rate of change is increasing so rapidly that we&#x27;ve got to get a handle on what&#x27;s going on.&quot; According to Chris Heron, the NWT Metis Nation representative of the PADEMP, the use of traditional knowledge to determine the ecological health of the Peace–Athabasca Delta and their findings will be investigated using western science.

== Conservation ==
The marshes, lakes and mud flats of this area are an important habitat for waterfowl nesting and provides a staging area for migration.

The unique location and habitat of the Peace–Athabasca Delta region supports numerous species of waterbirds and is one of the most important places in North America for migrating waterbirds to rest, feed and breed.

Although all four major North American flyways, Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific, cross the Peace–Athabasca Delta, it is &quot;probably the most significant to the Mississippi and Central flyways.&quot; In the spring, there can be up 400,000 migrating birds. In the fall, the number reaches one million. Species include ducks, geese, swans and the endangered whooping crane, which has its natural nesting place in the delta.

The grass and sedge meadows of this area also provide habitat for several thousand wood and plains bison.

=== Influence of Bennett Dam ===
In the late 1960s, the W.A.C. Bennett Dam was constructed on the Peace River in northern British Columbia by BC Hydro, a major hydropower utility. The impacts of the dam on the delta have been disputed. Initial drops in water levels were mitigated by the construction of three rock-fill weirs on the Chenal des Quatre Fourches, Revillon Coupé, and Rivière des Rochers, the first of which was later removed due to complaints from muskrat trappers. The weirs restored mean open-season water levels nearly to pre-regulation levels.

Critical to the delta are spring ice-jam floods that play a critical role in refilling perched basins and wetlands outside of the permanently connected channels and lakes. It has been claimed that the dam reduced ice-jam floods, but recent studies are not able to verify this claim. Sediment records were used to reconstruct the history of flooding for the past 300 years. Maximum flood frequency was seen to reach a maximum in the early 1900s and declined in the 1940s and 1950s prior to the construction of the dam. There were no major ice-jam floods between 1975 and 1995 and this could be a result of the dam. Major ice-jam floods occurred in 1996 and 1997. There have been similar prolonged periods lacking major flooding including 1813 to 1839 and 1705 to 1786.

Studies of the climate and ecology of the Peace–Athabasca Delta have been carried out to understand the effect of the dam on delta. It was found that the recent decades are neither the driest nor the wettest that the delta has experienced in the past three hundred years. The early 1900s were some of the wettest conditions experienced by the delta. During the early- to mid-1900s there was a general trend of drying. While the delta is drier today than it was in the early parts of the 1900s, there is no clear indication that the dam is responsible. The Peace–Athabasca Delta is still well within the range of naturally variability due to natural changes in climate seen within the past few centuries.

An ongoing lawsuit between BC Hydro and local First Nations bands relates to the effects of Bennett Dam on delta water levels and associated traditional lifestyles.

== Waterways ==
The Birch River flows into Lake Claire, the largest lake completely in Alberta, which is an important part of the delta. Other water bodies located in the delta are Baril Lake, Mamawi Lake, Hilda Lake, Otter Lake, French Lake, Pair Lakes, Welstead Lake, Four Forks Lake, Galoot Lake, Pushup Lake, Jemis Lake, Richardson Lake, Flett Lake, Blanche Lake and Limon Lake.

Revillon Coupé, Rivière des Rochers and Chenal des Quatre Fourches are the main distributaries connecting Lake Athabasca and the point where Peace River flows into the Slave River. When the Peace River is in flood, the flow of these channels are reversed and water from the Peace flows into Lake Athabasca.

Other rivers draining the wetlands through the Peace–Athabasca Delta include Swift Current Creek, Carolyn Creek, Modere Creek, Steepbank River, McIvor River, Buckton Creek, Frog Creek, Sall River, Bolton Creek, Edra Creek, Peel Creek, Alice Creek, Mamawi Creek, Embarras River, Horse Island Creek, Chilloneys Creek, Claire River, Dempsey Creek, Baril River, Peltier Creek, Scow Channel, Powder Creek, and Revillon Coupe.

<text>Jonas Duran Jennings (born November 21, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a offensive tackle that played in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the third round of the 2001 NFL draft. He has also played for the San Francisco 49ers. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs. Jennings is now director of player development for his alma mater, the University of Georgia. He was part of the Bulldogs&#x27; coaching staff that won the National Championship over Alabama in the 2021 season.

==Professional career==

===Buffalo Bills===
Jennings was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the third round of the 2001 NFL draft with the 95th overall pick.

In 2001, Jennings played 12 games, all of which he started at right tackle. 
In 2002, he moved to left tackle, starting all 15 games in which he appeared.
After 11 games in 2003, Jennings was placed on injured reserve with a toe injury. 
His final season with the Bills was 2004, when he started and played in 14 games.

===San Francisco 49ers===
Jennings signed with the San Francisco 49ers on March 3, 2005.

In his first season in San Francisco, he started the first three games of the season before being placed on injured reserve.

During the 2006 season, started 13 games and missed three. During the season, he was named a co-captain along with teammates Alex Smith, Walt Harris, Bryant Young and Keith Lewis.

On October 4, 2007, Jonas Jennings took a leave of absence from the San Francisco 49ers to deal with &#x27;private matters&#x27;. He was replaced by Adam Snyder for the week 5 game against the Baltimore Ravens. It was announced the week after that he would rejoin the team as the starter at LT, but during the next game against the New York Giants he split time with his backup Adam Snyder.

Jennings sustained a high ankle sprain in the second quarter of the 49ers&#x27; loss to the Giants on October 21 and missed the subsequent two games. On November 5 he was placed on Injured Reserve; coach Mike Nolan stated that Jennings was to undergo surgery to remove &quot;loose bodies&quot; in his ankle, effectively ending his 2007–2008 season.

The 49ers brought Jennings back for the 2008 NFL season but did not guarantee him a starting position. During the 2008 season Jennings continued his injury-stricken career as a 49er when he injured his right shoulder. Although he insisted on remaining on the sideline as an emergency backup, ultimately he was placed on injured reserve to undergo his 3rd shoulder surgery.

Jennings was released by the 49ers on March 27, 2009.

<doc id="1302298" wikidata="Q7847024" url="?curid=1302298" title="Troy Vincent">
<text>Troy Darnell Vincent Sr. (born June 8, 1970) is an American sports executive and former professional football player. He played as a cornerback for the Miami Dolphins, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Buffalo Bills and the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Dolphins as the seventh overall pick in the 1992 NFL draft. He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2023. On September 28, 2011, Vincent was named as one of the preliminary nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2012 in his first year of eligibility and each year since.

He was previously inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame for the Philadelphia Eagles and was entered into the Hall of Fame for the State of Pennsylvania, the University of Wisconsin and Pennsbury High School.

Vincent is currently the executive vice president of football operations for the NFL.

== Early life ==
Troy Vincent was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He spent his early childhood in east Trenton&#x27;s Wilbur section, where he and his younger brother, Sam, were raised by their mother, Alma. His athletic interests at the time centered on basketball.

Alma moved the family to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, before Vincent&#x27;s seventh-grade year. After a brief period in which Vincent returned to Trenton for his sophomore year, he returned to finish his secondary education at Pennsbury High School, where he was encouraged to try out for the football team and later starred for the Pennsbury Falcons. He also played recreationally with the Morrisville Little Bulldogs.

== College career and education ==
Vincent enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1988. He played cornerback for the Wisconsin Badgers and emerged as an All-American in 1991 under coach Barry Alvarez.

By the time he entered the NFL draft in 1992, Vincent had set Badgers&#x27; all-time records for passes defended in a season (13) and career (31). He finished his collegiate stint with 192 tackles, four interceptions and three punts returned for touchdowns, and was named team captain and MVP in his final season. He was inducted into the University of Wisconsin Athletics Hall of Fame in 2008 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2023.

Vincent studied urban planning and development at the University of Wisconsin. He completed his studies at Thomas Edison State College in Trenton, graduating in 2007 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in liberal arts.

He also holds executive education and advanced business certificates from several institutions, including Harvard, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.

==Professional career==
===Miami Dolphins===
Vincent was selected by the Miami Dolphins out of the University of Wisconsin–Madison as the seventh pick in the first round of the 1992 NFL draft. He became the Dolphins&#x27; starting left cornerback, and helped the Dolphins reach the AFC Championship Game his rookie year. During his time in Miami, he intercepted 14 passes and was among the team leaders in tackles.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
Vincent signed with his hometown team the Philadelphia Eagles in 1996, where he spent eight more seasons. Vincent made five consecutive Pro Bowls from 1999 to 2003. In 2002, Vincent was the recipient of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award. In 2007 Vincent was named to the Philadelphia Eagles 75th Anniversary Team. Vincent announced the Philadelphia Eagles 2nd Round Draft Pick at the 2011 NFL draft.

Vincent shares the record for the longest interception in Eagles history against the Dallas Cowboys in 1996; after teammate James Willis intercepted Troy Aikman four yards into the end zone, he ran 14 yards before lateraling to Vincent, who returned the interception 90 yards for a 104-yard touchdown.

===Buffalo Bills===
Prior to the 2004 NFL season, Vincent signed a free agent contract with the Buffalo Bills with the departure of cornerback Antoine Winfield. During his time in Buffalo, Vincent transitioned from the cornerback position, which he had played all his career, to free safety. In his first season as full-time safety in 2005, he had 66 tackles and a team-high four interceptions.

Vincent and starting strong safety Matt Bowen suffered injuries during the team&#x27;s 2006 season opener. In order to clear a roster spot, the Bills placed him on injured reserve on September 10 as he was expected to miss up to two months. Once he was cleared to play, the Bills granted Vincent his release on October 13.

===Washington Redskins===
On October 16, Vincent signed a three-year contract with the Washington Redskins.

On November 5, 2006, against the rival Dallas Cowboys, Vincent recorded six tackles and had a crucial block on a 35-yard field goal attempt by kicker Mike Vanderjagt as time expired. The block, along with a 15-yard face mask penalty, allowed the Redskins to return the ball into field goal range for kicker Nick Novak and win the game 22–19 with no time. The improbable win is known as the &quot;Hand of God&quot; game.

On February 22, 2007, the Redskins released Vincent.

===Career achievements===
On November 22, 2017, Vincent was honored by the Big Ten Conference as the 2017 recipient of the Ford-Kinnick Leadership Award. The annual award recognizes Big Ten football student-athletes who have garnered significant success in leadership roles following their academic and athletic careers. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame on December 5, 2023.

Vincent was honored by &quot;Ebony Magazine&quot; at their February 4, 2017, Celebration of Champions Super Bowl event, where he received the Ebony Pathfinder Award.

==NFL executive==

=== Executive Vice President of Football Operations (2014-present) ===
Vincent was named the NFL&#x27;s executive vice president of football operations in 2014, four years after joining the league office. His role includes oversight of game operations, officiating, on-field discipline, in-game analytics, personnel development and growth, policies and procedures related to NFL games, and other areas that affect the business of football. He also is involved in the league&#x27;s inclusion initiatives, leading pipeline programs for coaches and front office executives of color.

As part of his role as the NFL&#x27;s head of football operations, Vincent is a member of the American Football Coaches Association, an organization that represents coaches across the United States and is often consulted by the NCAA and the media regarding rule changes and developments occurring in college football, and serves as a non-voting member of the NFL&#x27;s competition committee. In an October 24, 2017, feature article in The Root publication, Vincent discussed his role as &quot;bridge-builder&quot; in the ongoing debate about players taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem.

In the January 2018 issue of Monarch Magazine, Vincent talks about the &quot;Game of Giving&quot; and his commitment to American football. Vincent&#x27;s leadership and impact on the game of football and social issues was detailed in Jarrett Bell&#x27;s column in USA Today.

==== Flag Football Expansion and Advocacy ====
In 2022, Vincent and International Federation of American Football president Pierre Trochet were named co-chairs of Vision28, a group that lobbied for flag football&#x27;s inclusion in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Their efforts led to the International Olympic Committee adding flag football to the LA Summer Games.

Vincent has also advocated for the expansion of flag football in the U.S., citing the demand created by a spike in participation among girls and young women. He has described flag as &quot;football for all&quot; due to the sport&#x27;s greater accessibility for women, people with disabilities, and others to play in a non-contact format and earn opportunities such as college scholarships. Vincent has met with aspiring flag football players in high schools, introduced flag to U.S. colleges through a partnership with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, and published op-eds arguing for states such as California, New York and Colorado to approve flag football as a varsity sport statewide.

==== Deflategate Involvement ====
After the 2014 AFC Championship Game, ESPN&#x27;s Chris Mortensen reported that 11 of the Patriots&#x27; 12 game footballs were underinflated by at least two pounds each.

Mortensen&#x27;s report later turned out to be false, and according to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, Mortensen got his false info from NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent. Florio noted that it&#x27;s &quot;unclear&quot; whether Vincent &quot;deliberately lied&quot; to Mortensen, however, Vincent was the one who handed out the initial four-game suspension to Brady in May 2015, suggesting a conflict of interest behind NFL walls as it investigated Brady.

===Sr. Vice President of Player Engagement (2010-2014)===
Vincent joined the NFL&#x27;s league office in February 2010 as vice president of player development, leading support programs for players and their families, such as the Rookie Symposium and life skills initiatives. He was promoted to senior vice president of player engagement in 2013.

During his tenure as head of development and engagement, Vincent expanded the league&#x27;s services, helping to launch programs such as NFL Total Wellness for current and former players. Vincent also started the peer-to-peer NFL Legends community and has been credited with recruiting hundreds of former NFL players as ambassadors for the league&#x27;s various support initiatives.

Vincent estimated that monthly participation increased from &quot;probably 200, 300 players&quot; when he joined the NFL office to around 20,000 active and retired players by 2014.

==NFLPA career==
Vincent was president of the NFL Players Association from March 29, 2004, until March 18, 2008. He was replaced by Kevin Mawae. During his time with the Players Association, Vincent helped negotiate and implement three collective bargaining agreement extensions.

On February 26, 2009, the Players Association announced they were investigating whether during his tenure as president Vincent disclosed confidential personal and financial information about a number of player agents. It is alleged Vincent emailed this information to his longtime business partner Mark Magnum for the benefit of a financial services firm co-owned by the two men. However, the Associated Press uncovered no evidence to support the contention that Vincent, by forwarding an NFLPA e-mail to his business partner, used agents&#x27; personal information to build his financial services company.

===NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program===
While playing for the Buffalo Bills, Vincent approached the Wharton School with an idea to create educational programs to help fellow players prepare for life after football. This led to the formation of the NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program led by Vincent and former NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw. Jason Wingard of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; spoke to Vincent&#x27;s vision and the need for those entering the NFL to prepare for retirement from football.

==Community involvement and philanthropic efforts==
Vincent has served on numerous boards over his career and served on the board of directors for the University of Wisconsin Foundation, and the State of New Jersey After 3 Program. He became the first active NFL player to serve on the National Board of Directors for Pop Warner Little Scholars Football.

=== Domestic violence and sexual assault awareness ===
A national advocate for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, Vincent shared his family&#x27;s own story of experiencing domestic violence in a February 19, 2017, guest editorial in the Naples Daily News prior to his February 20 keynote address at The Naples Shelter for Abused Women and Children&#x27;s annual event. In multiple forums, Vincent has advocated for an end to domestic violence. He has also challenged men to &quot;stand beside women as leaders in the fight against domestic violence and sexual assault.&quot;

In 2023, Troy Vincent and his wife Tommi Vincent, chair of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, launched the Vincent Commission in partnership with Niagara University to study and address gender-based violence. Vincent has been honored by organizations such as Womanspace, Women Against Abuse and the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation for his work to advance domestic violence awareness.

=== Love Thy Neighbor ===
Vincent and his family founded the Love Thy Neighbor Community Development and Opportunity Corporation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to fostering positive change in young people&#x27;s lives through character, athletics and academics. Since its founding in Trenton, N.J., in the 1990s, Love Thy Neighbor has provided college scholarships and mentoring programs for high school students, and school supplies for elementary students in inner cities, among other initiatives.

Each year ahead of the Super Bowl, Love Thy Neighbor holds a virtual fundraiser and the &quot;Vincent Country Safe Zone Activity Day&quot; for students at an under-resourced elementary school in the game&#x27;s host city. The seventh annual activity day in 2024, held at Matt Kelly Elementary School in Las Vegas, Nevada, included sports, games, food and resources. Students received free eye exams and glasses, health screenings, and haircuts provided by former NFL star Steven Jackson, co-founder of the Original Barber School in Las Vegas.

=== Other community involvement ===
The Vincent family donated funds to help restore a park in Trenton, N.J., where Troy Vincent played basketball growing up. The city later renamed the park in memory of his grandfather, Jefferson Vincent.

In 2011, Vincent returned to another one of the communities he grew up in; the Pennsbury School District in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His visit was in support of the Fuel Up To Play 60 program at Edgewood Elementary School. During this visit, Vincent spent time with the students, teachers, and parents.

==Personal life==
Vincent and his wife Tommi, a cousin to drag racer Antron Brown, have five children – three sons and two daughters. His son Taron Vincent is a defensive tackle who played college football at Ohio State and signed with the Los Angeles Rams in 2023.

Vincent is a Christian.

<text>Frederick Wilson Talbot (born 17 December 1949) is a British former television presenter. He grew up in north west England.

==Early life and teaching==
Born in Edinburgh, Talbot grew up in north west England, where he attended North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham, Cheshire. In 1964 he was a founding member of the Altrincham and District Astronomical Society, with which he co-discovered a meteor shower, the June Lyrids in June 1966.

After teacher training in Gateshead in the late 1960s, he was employed to teach biology at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys until May 1984, when his schooling career came to &quot;an abrupt end&quot; following an indecent proposal he made to two pupils at his home.

==Media career==

Talbot began working for Granada Television in 1982, with &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, an educational science series networked on ITV as part of their children&#x27;s programming strand. In 1984, he began presenting for the regional news programme &quot;Granada Reports&quot; in North West England. He continued as a regular reporter for &quot;Granada Reports&quot; and became a weatherman for the ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; in October 1988.

Until production of This Morning was moved from the Albert Dock, Liverpool, to London, Talbot presented weather reports from a large floating map of the UK and Ireland in the dock. He was required to jump across a gap to go back and forth between Britain and the island of Ireland. Crowds often gathered to watch his leap. On one occasion in 2004, a diver swam near the map to distract Talbot and on another a streaker swam naked up to the map and jumped on.

Talbot also presented several regional feature series for ITV Granada, including &quot;Locks and Quays&quot; and &quot;Wainwright Country&quot; before returning to weather presenting with &quot;Granada Reports&quot; in February 2009. He also contributed to the CITV science series &quot;Prove It!&quot; and guest presented weather forecasts for the ITV Breakfast programme &quot;Daybreak&quot;.

==Indecent assault convictions==
In December 2012, Greater Manchester Police carried out a search of Talbot&#x27;s home in Bowdon, when allegations first emerged of abuse at Altrincham Grammar School between the early 1970s and early 1980s. A day before the search, Talbot posted on his Twitter account that he was on a holiday cruise in the Atlantic Ocean.

He did not return to his role at ITV Granada upon his return to the UK, but he was not suspended.

In April 2013, police arrested Talbot, who refused to answer interview questions about allegations by men who claimed they had been abused as children. Following a re-arrest in December 2013, he was charged with ten historical sexual offences, followed by an eleventh charge for a further sexual assault in June 2014.

His trial began in January 2015, accused of abusing four former pupils at Altrincham Grammar School and a fifth schoolboy from the Newcastle area, during an annual holiday in the 1970s. He was defended by Suzanne Goddard QC. Witnesses included Stone Roses lead singer Ian Brown, a former pupil of Talbot&#x27;s at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, who swore under oath that Talbot showed his class gay pornographic films. Evidence was also provided by Talbot&#x27;s extensive diaries, which noted his sexual activity. On 13 February 2015, a jury at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester found Talbot guilty of indecent assault against two teenage boys at the school, and acquitted him of eight further charges. Immediately remanded in custody bearing in mind Talbot&#x27;s &quot;abuse of trust&quot;, sentencing was adjourned until 13 March 2015. With reporting restrictions lifted, it was noted that a number of similar complaints against Talbot had since been passed by police to the procurator fiscal about alleged offences said to have been committed in Scotland. During the trial, Talbot said he knew at fourteen that he was homosexual.

At Minshull Street Crown Court on 13 March 2015, Judge Timothy Mort sentenced Talbot to five years in prison. Talbot was told that he would serve at least two-and-a-half years in prison before being considered for release on licence.

Talbot appeared in a Scottish court on 11 March 2016, where he faced ten fresh charges of indecent assault dating from 1968 to 1981 and two charges of breach of the peace. He did not enter a plea during the hearing. In May 2017, Talbot was convicted of seven charges of indecent assault against boys that took place on trips to Scotland while he was a teacher at Altrincham Grammar. On 15 June 2017, he was sentenced to four years&#x27; imprisonment at Lanark Sheriff Court, to run from 14 August, after he had served half of his existing sentence for indecent assault. On 29 November 2017, Talbot was jailed for eight months for a further sexual assault, this time of a male over the age of 16, having admitted the offence at a previous hearing.

Talbot was released from prison in December 2019.

==Awards==
In 1998, Talbot was named Weatherman of the Year at the Annual International Weather Festival in Paris.

In 2007, Talbot was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Manchester Metropolitan University in recognition of bringing to a mass audience a better understanding of scientific and environmental issues.

<text>&quot;Fraudcast News&quot; is the twenty-second and final episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 23, 2004. The episode was written by Don Payne and directed by Bob Anderson.

In this episode, Mr. Burns acquires all media outlets in town to improve his image while Lisa begins publishing her own newspaper. The episode received positive reviews. Payne won the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s Paul Selvin Award, which honors works that focus on First Amendment issues, for his work on the episode.

==Plot==
Springfield holds a ceremony dedicating their newest national park, Geezer Rock, a rock formation which resembles the face of an old man in profile. As Lisa Simpson prepares to read a poem there at the behest of Mayor Quimby, Homer notices that there is a small tree growing in the eye of the rock. Fearing that it will destroy Geezer Rock over time, he rushes over and pulls it out. This causes Geezer Rock to fall apart, and everyone runs for their lives — except for Mr. Burns, who winds up in a landslide. Smithers is fearful he has lost Mr. Burns.

Lisa is saddened that no one ever heard her poem, and she publishes it on Marge&#x27;s suggestion. Meanwhile, it turns out that Burns survived the horrible landslide through slithering his way out and subsisting on centipedes, insects and mole milk. However, Springfield&#x27;s local news instead reports on the destruction of Geezer Rock and then labels Burns as being a hateful man nobody liked.

Lisa distributes the very first issue of her newspaper, &quot;The Red Dress Press&quot;, which is well received. She enlists the help of Bart, Milhouse Van Houten, Martin Prince, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum among others, to publish her newspaper&#x27;s second issue. Meanwhile, to improve his image after the landslide, Burns acquires all media outlets in Springfield except Lisa&#x27;s newspaper. He even makes an episode of &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; promoting nuclear power. Later, Burns tries to bait Lisa with ponies in an attempt to acquire her newspaper, but she will not give up. Lisa is saddened when all the other employees of the newspaper leave her, but is relieved when Bart decides to stay and help Lisa publish more issues.

Burns gets back at Lisa by cutting off the Simpsons&#x27; power, so Lisa is forced to write her next issue through an old mimeograph that Principal Skinner used in Vietnam. Burns finally wins the war by interrogating Homer with a truth serum so he can damage Lisa&#x27;s reputation; the following day&#x27;s &quot;Springfield Shopper&quot; boasts the headline, &quot;LISA’S A TOTAL WACKO, IMPLIES FATHER&quot;, and goes further by humiliating Milhouse&#x27;s crush upon her. Lisa writes her final &quot;I Give Up&quot; edition and shuts down the &quot;Red Dress Press&quot;. Homer responds by creating his own newspaper, &quot;The Homer Times&quot;, with which he defends Lisa and her journalistic integrity, while many of the townspeople, inspired by Homer, also create their own newspapers to voice their individual opinions. Burns realizes that, while he succeeded in defeating Lisa and her journal, he cannot possibly buy out everyone nor stop people criticizing him. As a result, he is forced to acknowledge that no one besides Rupert Murdoch can truly control the whole media, and goes out on a shopping spree with Smithers for relief.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
In its original airing, this episode was watched by 9.2 million viewers.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; thought the episode was better than the previous episode even though they both dealt with political commentary. He said the episode was &quot;a good capper for a spotty but often enjoyable season.&quot;

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Brendan Dando and Guy Davis liked the final two acts and felt the episode&#x27;s plot was realistic in contrast with the previous episode.

===Awards and nominations===
At the 57th Writers Guild of America Awards, writer Don Payne won the Paul Selvin Award for this episode. In addition, he was also nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation for his script to this episode.

<text>Siegbert Salomon Prawer (15 February 1925 – 5 April 2012) was Taylor Professor of the German Language and Literature at the University of Oxford.

==Life and works==
Prawer was born on 15 February 1925 in Cologne, Germany, to Jewish parents Marcus and Eleanora (Cohn) Prawer. Marcus was a lawyer from Poland and Eleanora&#x27;s father was cantor of Cologne&#x27;s largest synagogue. His sister Ruth was born in 1927. The family fled the Nazi regime in 1939, emigrating to Britain.

Educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry, and Jesus College, Cambridge, he was lecturer at the University of Birmingham from 1948 to 1963, Professor of German at Westfield College, London, from 1964, and became Taylor Professor of the German Language and Literature at the University of Oxford in 1969. He was awarded his PhD by Birmingham University in 1953 (PhD, University of Birmingham, Department of German, 1953, &#x27;A critical analysis of 24 consecutive poems from Heine&#x27;s Romanzero&#x27;).

He was a Fellow (then an Honorary Fellow) of Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge.

He had academic interests in German poetry and lieder, Romantic German literature, especially E. T. A. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine, comparative literature and also in film, particularly horror films.

His sister was the writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. He made a cameo appearance in the Merchant-Ivory film &quot;Howards End&quot; (for which his sister wrote the Academy Award-winning screenplay).

Prawer died on 5 April 2012 in Oxford, England.

<doc id="1302326" wikidata="Q13415" url="?curid=1302326" title="Beta Canis Majoris">
<text>Beta Canis Majoris (β Canis Majoris, abbreviated Beta CMa, β CMa), also named Mirzam , is a star in the southern constellation of Canis Major, the &quot;Great Dog&quot;, located at a distance of about 500 light-years (150 parsecs) from the Sun. In the modern constellation it lies at the position of the dog&#x27;s front leg.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;Beta Canis Majoris&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. The traditional names &quot;Mirzam&quot;, &quot;Al-Murzim&quot; or &quot;Murzim&quot;, derive from the Arabic (مرزم) for &#x27;The Herald&#x27;, and probably refer to its position, heralding (i.e., rising before) Sirius in the night sky. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Mirzam&quot; for this star.

In Chinese, (), meaning &#x27;Market for Soldiers&#x27;, refers to an asterism consisting of β Canis Majoris, Nu3 Canis Majoris, 15 Canis Majoris, Pi Canis Majoris, Omicron1 Canis Majoris and Xi1 Canis Majoris. Consequently, β Canis Majoris itself is known as (, ). From this Chinese name arose the name &quot;Kuen She&quot;.

The Dunhuang Star Chart noted β Canis Majoris as Yeji &quot;Pheasant Cock&quot;, though was located about 10 degrees too far north of its correct position.

Beta Canis Majoris was called &quot;Oupo&quot; by the people of the Tuamotus.

==Properties ==

Mirzam is a Beta Cephei variable that varies in apparent magnitude between +1.97 and +2.01 over a six-hour period, a change in brightness that is too small to be discerned with the naked eye. It exhibits this variation in luminosity because of periodic pulsations in its outer envelope, which follow a complex pattern with three different cycles; all about six hours in length. The two dominant pulsation frequencies have a combined beat period of roughly 50 days. The strongest pulsation mode is a radial first overtone, while the second is non-radial.
This star has a mass of about 12–13 times the mass of the Sun with 7.4 or 8.2 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. The effective temperature of the star&#x27;s outer envelope is about 24,700 K, which is much higher than the Sun&#x27;s at 5,778 K. The energy emitted at the high temperature of the former is what gives this star a blue-white hue characteristic of a B-type star. The estimated age of Mirzam is , which is long enough for a star of this mass to have evolved into a giant star. The stellar classification of B1 II-III indicates that the spectrum matches a star part way between a giant star and a bright giant. This star has a rotation period of 13.6 days and is inclined 57.6 ° as seen from Earth.

Beta Canis Majoris is located near the far end of the Local Bubble, a cavity in the local interstellar medium through which the Sun is traveling. It is located within the Mirzam Tunnel, a region of less dense concentration between the stars and HII regions surrounding the Ori OB1 and Vel OB2 associations. Beta Canis Majoris was the brightest star in the night sky around four million years ago, peaking with an apparent magnitude of -3.65, or more than seven times as bright as Sirius today.

==In culture==
Mirzam appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolising the state of Amapá.

&quot;Murzim&quot; (AK-95) was a United States Navy Crater class cargo ship named after one of the star&#x27;s alternative traditional names.

<text>The Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus is a feast of the liturgical year celebrated by Christians on varying dates.

==History==
The feast of the Holy Name of Jesus has been celebrated in the Roman Catholic Church, at least at local levels, since the end of the fifteenth century. The celebration has been held on different dates, usually in January, because 1 January, eight days after Christmas, commemorates the naming of the child Jesus; as recounted in the Gospel read on that day, &quot;at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.&quot; Medieval Catholicism, and many Christian churches to the present day, therefore celebrated both events as the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, usually on 1 January. An Office and Mass were approved by Pope Sixtus IV.

Observance of the feast was officially granted to the Franciscans in 1530 and spread over a great part of the Church. The Franciscans, Carmelites, and Augustinians kept the feast on 14 January, the Dominicans on 15 January. At Salisbury, York, and Durham in England, and at Aberdeen in Scotland it was celebrated on 7 August, at Liège (now in Belgium) on 31 January, at Compostela in Spain and Cambrai in France on 8 January.

Around 1643 the Carthusians were granted permission to celebrate the feast on the second Sunday after the Epiphany. This was the date assigned to the celebration when, on 20 December 1721, it was inserted into the General Calendar of the Roman Rite by Pope Innocent XIII. In the reform of Pope Pius X, enacted by his motu proprio &quot;Abhinc duos annos&quot; of 23 October 1913, it was moved to the Sunday between 2 and 5 January inclusive, and in years when no such Sunday existed the celebration was observed on 2 January; this is still observed by Catholics following the 1962 calendar.

The reform of the General Roman Calendar by the motu proprio &quot;Mysterii Paschalis&quot; of 14 February 1969 removed the feast &quot;since the imposition of the name of Jesus is already commemorated in the office of the Octave of Christmas.&quot; However, a newly composed Mass formulary of the Holy Name of Jesus was placed among the Votive Masses. The celebration was restored to the General Roman Calendar on 3 January with the promulgation of a revised edition of the Roman Missal in 2002. On this occasion an entirely new Mass formulary was composed for use on the memorial day, while the 1970 votive Mass formulary was kept unchanged. Catholics using the 1962 Missal of St. John XXIII still observe the celebration on 2 January with the corresponding texts there prescribed.

==Present day==
In the Catholic Church of Roman Rite, therefore, the festivity is as a general rule celebrated under the title of the Most Holy Name of Jesus as an optional memorial on 3 January. The Jesuits celebrate the Holy Name of Jesus on 3 January as the order&#x27;s titular solemnity. Furthermore, among Catholics the month of January is traditionally dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.

In the Lutheran Church, the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus is sometimes celebrated as a part of the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ on 1 January.

In some Anglican churches including the Episcopal Church (United States), the feast is observed on 1 January. In the Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America since 1979, the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ celebrated on 1 January is now listed as the &quot;Feast of the Holy Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. In the Church of England, the calendar of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer stipulates a festival &quot;The Name of Jesus&quot; to be observed on 7 August (as had been the practice at Salisbury, Durham, and York, but in the more recent &quot;Common Worship&quot; resources the Feast of the Circumcision and Naming of Christ (1 January) takes its place as the primary festival of the name of Jesus. The Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s &#x27;Book of Common Prayer&#x27; (1962) retains the date of 7 August, but as a commemoration, not a feast day. Many Eastern Churches celebrate the feast on 1 January.

The United Methodist Church observes the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus on 1 January, with the liturgical colour of the day being white/gold.

The Presbyterian Church (USA) observes the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus on 1 January.

In Western Rite Orthodoxy, the feast is celebrated on 7 August.

<doc id="1302341" wikidata="Q739536" url="?curid=1302341" title="Luneburg lens">
<text>A Luneburg lens (original German &quot;Lüneburg-Linse&quot;) is a spherically symmetric gradient-index lens. A typical Luneburg lens&#x27;s refractive index &quot;n&quot; decreases radially from the center to the outer surface. They can be made for use with electromagnetic radiation from visible light to radio waves.

For certain index profiles, the lens will form perfect geometrical images of two given concentric spheres onto each other. There are an infinite number of refractive-index profiles that can produce this effect. The simplest such solution was proposed by Rudolf Luneburg in 1944. Luneburg&#x27;s solution for the refractive index creates two conjugate foci outside the lens. The solution takes a simple and explicit form if one focal point lies at infinity, and the other on the opposite surface of the lens. J. Brown and A. S. Gutman subsequently proposed solutions which generate one internal focal point and one external focal point. These solutions are not unique; the set of solutions are defined by a set of definite integrals which must be evaluated numerically.

==Designs==
===Luneburg&#x27;s solution===

Each point on the surface of an ideal Luneburg lens is the focal point for parallel radiation incident on the opposite side. Ideally, the dielectric constant formula_1 of the material composing the lens falls from 2 at its center to 1 at its surface (or equivalently, the refractive index formula_2 falls from formula_3 to 1), according to

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the radius of the lens. Because the refractive index at the surface is the same as that of the surrounding medium, no reflection occurs at the surface. Within the lens, the paths of the rays are arcs of ellipses.

===Maxwell&#x27;s fish-eye lens===

Maxwell&#x27;s fish-eye lens is also an example of the generalized Luneburg lens. The fish-eye, which was first fully described by Maxwell in 1854 (and therefore pre-dates Luneburg&#x27;s solution), has a refractive index varying according to

:formula_6
where formula_7 is the index of refraction at the center of the lens and formula_5 is the radius of the lens&#x27;s spherical surface. The index of refraction at the lens&#x27;s surface is formula_9. The lens images each point on the spherical surface to the opposite point on the surface. Within the lens, the paths of the rays are arcs of circles. 

====Publication and attribution====
The properties of this lens are described in one of a number of set problems or puzzles in the 1853 &quot;Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal&quot;. The challenge is to find the refractive index as a function of radius, given that a ray describes a circular path, and further to prove the focusing properties of the lens. The solution is given in the 1854 edition of the same journal. The problems and solutions were originally published anonymously, but the solution of this problem (and one other) were included in Niven&#x27;s &quot;The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell&quot;, which was published 11 years after Maxwell&#x27;s death.

==Applications==
In practice, Luneburg lenses are normally layered structures of discrete concentric shells, each of a different refractive index. These shells form a stepped refractive index profile that differs slightly from Luneburg&#x27;s solution. This kind of lens is usually employed for microwave frequencies, especially to construct efficient microwave antennas and radar calibration standards. Cylindrical analogues of the Luneburg lens are also used for collimating light from laser diodes.

===Radar reflector===

A radar reflector can be made from a Luneburg lens by metallizing parts of its surface. Radiation from a distant radar transmitter is focussed onto the underside of the metallization on the opposite side of the lens; here it is reflected, and focussed back onto the radar station. A difficulty with this scheme is that metallized regions block the entry or exit of radiation on that part of the lens, but the non-metallized regions result in a blind-spot on the opposite side.

Removable Luneburg lens type radar reflectors are sometimes attached to military aircraft in order to make stealth aircraft visible during training operations, or to conceal their true radar signature. Unlike other types of radar reflectors, their shape doesn&#x27;t affect the handling of the aircraft.

===Microwave antenna===

In modern millimeter wave and microwave systems, specialized microwave antenna equipment is often required. A custom-made Luneburg lens antenna can be designed to meet specific requirements, including different sizes, feeds, and operating frequencies. A Luneburg lens can be used as the basis of a high-gain radio antenna. 

A Luneburg lens antenna is comparable to a parabolic dish antenna, but uses the lens rather than a parabolic reflector as the main focusing element. As with the dish antenna, a &quot;feed&quot; to the receiver or from the transmitter is placed at the focus, the feed typically consisting of a horn antenna. The phase centre of the feed horn must coincide with the point of focus, but since the phase centre is invariably somewhat inside the mouth of the horn, it cannot be brought right up against the surface of the lens. Consequently it is necessary to use a variety of Luneburg lens that focusses somewhat beyond its surface, rather than the classic lens with the focus lying on the surface.

A Luneburg lens antenna offers a number of advantages over a parabolic dish antenna. Because the lens is spherically symmetric, the antenna can be steered by moving the feed around the lens, without having to bodily rotate the whole antenna. Again, because the lens is spherically symmetric, a single lens can be used with several feeds looking in widely different directions. In contrast, if multiple feeds are used with a parabolic reflector, all must be within a small angle of the optical axis to avoid suffering coma (a form of de-focussing). Apart from offset systems, dish antennas suffer from the feed and its supporting structure partially obscuring the main element (&quot;aperture blockage&quot;); in common with other refracting systems, the Luneburg lens antenna avoids this problem.

A variation on the Luneburg lens antenna is the &quot;hemispherical Luneburg lens antenna&quot; or &quot;Luneburg reflector antenna&quot;. This uses just one hemisphere of a Luneburg lens, with the cut surface of the sphere resting on a reflecting metal ground plane. The arrangement halves the weight of the lens, and the ground plane provides a convenient means of support. However, the feed does partially obscure the lens when the angle of incidence on the reflector is less than about 45°.

In 2015, U.S. wireless network operator AT&amp;T used a new &amp; high-capacity antenna called the &quot;Giant Eyeball Antenna,&quot; a Luneburg lens antenna, at a music festival in Chicago. It helped a mass of attendees stay connected and share the most exciting moments without causing major network problems. The antenna is said to be so effective that it provided attendees with 10 times more capacity than a traditional single-beam antenna. The antenna is perfect for events like festivals or parades when people are roaming the grounds and not seated in one location.

==Path of a ray within the lens==
For any spherically symmetric lens, each ray lies entirely in a plane passing through the centre of the lens. The initial direction of the ray defines a line which together with the centre-point of the lens identifies a plane bisecting the lens. Being a plane of symmetry of the lens, the gradient of the refractive index has no component perpendicular to this plane to cause the ray to deviate either to one side of it or the other. In the plane, the circular symmetry of the system makes it convenient to use polar coordinates formula_10 to describe the ray&#x27;s trajectory.

Given any two points on a ray (such as the point of entry and exit from the lens), Fermat&#x27;s principle asserts that the path that the ray takes between them is that which it can traverse in the least possible time. Given that the speed of light at any point in the lens is inversely proportional to the refractive index, and by Pythagoras, the time of transit between two points formula_11 and formula_12 is

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the speed of light in vacuum. Minimizing this formula_15 yields a second-order differential equation determining the dependence of formula_16 on formula_17 along the path of the ray. This type of minimization problem has been extensively studied in Lagrangian mechanics, and a ready-made solution exists in the form of the Beltrami identity, which immediately supplies the first integral of this second-order equation. Substituting formula_18 (where formula_19 represents formula_20), into this identity gives

:formula_21

where formula_22 is a constant of integration. This first-order differential equation is separable, that is it can be re-arranged so that formula_16 only appears on one side, and formula_17 only on the other:

:formula_25

The parameter formula_22 is a constant for any given ray, but differs between rays passing at different distances from the centre of the lens. For rays passing through the centre, it is zero. In some special cases, such as for Maxwell&#x27;s fish-eye, this first order equation can be further integrated to give a formula for formula_17 as a function of formula_16. In general it provides the relative rates of change of formula_17 and formula_16, which may be integrated numerically to follow the path of the ray through the lens.

<doc id="1302347" wikidata="Q4908063" url="?curid=1302347" title="Bill Baxter (Victorian politician)">
<text>William Robert Baxter (born 3 November 1946) is a former Australian politician and a former Victorian State President of The Nationals. He was the Nationals member of the Victorian Legislative Council representing North Eastern Province from June 1978 until November 2006 (excepting a four-month break in 1984–85). He also served one term in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1973 to 1976.

==Early life==
Baxter was born and raised in the Nathalia area. He started high school in Nathalia, but completed his secondary schooling at the prestigious Scotch College, Melbourne, where he was a boarder in School House. He then returned to his family property at Picola, near Nathalia, and began working as a farmer and grazier. Around the same time, he began to pursue an interest in politics.

==Political career==
In 1966, at the age of only twenty, he became the secretary of his local Country Party branch, and a delegate to the party conference. At the 1969 federal election, he was campaign director in Deputy Prime Minister Sir John McEwen&#x27;s seat of Murray.

Baxter was elected to the Nathalia Shire Council in 1970, and in 1973 became the Shire President. In the same year, he stood as the National Party candidate for the relatively safe Legislative Assembly seat of Murray Valley, replacing the retiring member George Moss. Having been easily elected, he juggled the two commitments until 1975, when he ceased to be Shire President, although he remained on the council. Throughout this term, Baxter also served on the parliamentary Road Safety Committee. In the lead-up to the 1976 state election, the Murray Valley electorate underwent major boundary changes, and as a result, Baxter chose to contest the adjacent seat of Benambra. Baxter polled the most primary votes, but although it had been a National Party seat since 1932, Benambra fell to Lou Lieberman of the rival conservative Liberal Party on preferences.

After losing his seat in the Legislative Assembly, Baxter made a comeback in 1978, when he switched to the Legislative Council and successfully contested a by-election in the safe National Party seat of North Eastern Province. He received his first parliamentary position the following year, when he was appointed as Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council and Party Whip. He was again returned in a regular election the following year. After the election, he nominated for a position on the Public Works Committee, and served there until 1982, when he switched to the Natural Resources and Environment Committee.

In 1984, Baxter resigned from the Legislative Council to contest the federal seat of Indi, challenging sitting Liberal member Ewen Cameron. The bid was unsuccessful, as Baxter came third behind Cameron and the ALP candidate, and Cameron was easily re-elected on Baxter&#x27;s preferences. Baxter subsequently contested the by-election for his old seat in February 1985, and was once again elected to the Legislative Council. Over the next three years, he served on three more committees, responsible for Economic and Budget Review, WorkCare and Social Development.

Baxter retained his previous portfolios after being re-elected in 1985, and received another promotion in 1988, when he became Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council. In 1990, he was made Shadow Minister for Roads and Ports as part of the Liberal-National coalition opposition. Two years later, Jeff Kennett led the coalition to an election victory, and Baxter became Minister for Roads and Ports in the new government. However, the 1996 election saw a changed ratio between the two parties, and the National Party lost one of its portfolios to the Liberals. As a result, Baxter returned to the backbenches, and instead took up a position as Chairman of the Parliament House Completion Authority, which oversaw the renovation of Parliament House in order to comply with the original architectural designs.

The coalition between the Liberal and National parties again fractured after the Kennett government suffered a surprise defeat at the 1999 election. This meant that a range of new portfolios had to be filled, in order to cover all the areas that had previously been overseen by members of the larger Liberal Party. When these were allocated after the 2002 election, Baxter once again was in line for promotion, obtaining the high-profile portfolios of the treasury, finance, industry, industrial relations and the financial services industry. In addition, he was also a member of the Legislative Council Privileges and Public Accounts and Estimates Committees.

Baxter was an active member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for many years, having served on its executive committee and attended numerous conferences, going back as far as 1980. In September 2002, he made a bid for the position of executive committee chairman, but was defeated by Canada&#x27;s Bob Speller.

As a result of reforms to the Legislative Council made after the 2002 election, Baxter&#x27;s two-member electorate was abolished and replaced with a larger, five-member electorate. After fellow incumbent Damian Drum won the first spot on the National Party ticket, Baxter decided to transfer back to the Legislative Assembly, and he hoped to regain the seat of Benambra for the Nationals at the upcoming 2006 election. He polled third behind Bill Tilley of the Liberal Party and Labor candidate Lisa Mahood.

In early 2007 Baxter became the Victorian State President of The Nationals after the resignation of John Tanner, who became Federal President. After retiring from the presidency in 2009, Baxter was awarded life membership of the Victorian National Party.

In 2018, Baxter was inducted as a Member of the Order of Australia for services to the Victorian Parliament.

<doc id="1302352" wikidata="Q49094494" url="?curid=1302352" title="Panelling">
<text>Panelling (or paneling in the United States) is a millwork wall covering constructed from rigid or semi-rigid components. These are traditionally interlocking wood, but could be plastic or other materials.

Panelling was developed in antiquity to make rooms in stone buildings more comfortable both by insulating the room from the stone and reflecting radiant heat from wood fires, making heat more evenly distributed in the room. In more modern buildings, such panelling is often installed for decorative purposes. Panelling, such as wainscoting and boiserie in particular, may be extremely ornate and is particularly associated with 17th and 18th century interior design, Victorian architecture in Britain, and its international contemporaries.

== Wainscot panelling ==
The term wainscot ( or ) originally applied to high quality riven oak boards.

Wainscot oak came from large, slow-grown forest trees, and produced boards that were knot-free, low in tannin, light in weight, and easy to work with. It was preferred to home-grown oak, especially in the Netherlands and British Isles, because it was a far superior product and dimensionally stable.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that it derives from the Middle Low German &quot;wagenschot&quot; as well as &quot;wageschot&quot; or &#x27;wall-board&#x27;. &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defined it thus: 

A &#x27;wainscot&#x27; was therefore a board of riven (and later quarter-sawn) oak, and wainscoting was the panelling made from it. During the 18th century, oak wainscot was almost entirely superseded for panelling in Europe by softwoods (mainly Scots pine and Norway spruce), but the name stuck:

Today the term wainscot refers commonly to the different treatment of the lower part of the wall (roughly a meter, 3–4 feet); see also dado.

== &quot;Boiserie&quot; ==

Boiserie (; often used in the plural boiseries) is the French term used to define ornate and intricately carved wood panelling. &quot;Boiseries&quot; became popular in the latter part of the 17th century in French interior design, becoming a &quot;de rigueur &quot; feature of fashionable French interiors throughout the 18th century. Such panels were most often painted in two shades of a chosen color or in contrasting colors, with gilding reserved for the main reception rooms. The Palace of Versailles contains many fine examples of white painted &quot;boiseries&quot; with gilded mouldings installed in the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI. The panels were not confined to just the walls of a room but were used to decorate doors, frames, cupboards, and shelves also. It was standard for mirrors to be installed and framed by the carved &quot;boiseries&quot;, especially above the mantelpiece of a fireplace. Paintings were also installed within &quot;boiseries&quot;, above doorways or set into central panels.

== Wood wall panelling ==
Wood wall panelling has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years due to its aesthetic appeal, versatility, and sustainability. Traditionally used to insulate and decorate interiors, modern wood panelling includes wainscoting, beadboard, shiplap, board and batten, and both raised and flat panels. This renewed interest is driven by the material&#x27;s natural warmth and texture, its eco-friendly properties when sourced responsibly, and the influence of contemporary design trends showcased in media and online platforms.

<doc id="1302363" wikidata="Q614667" url="?curid=1302363" title="Tyrell Biggs">
<text>Tyrell Biggs (born December 22, 1960) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 1998, and challenged once for the undisputed heavyweight title in 1987. As an amateur he won a gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics, having previously won bronze at the 1983 Pan American Games and gold at the 1982 World Championships, all in the super heavyweight division.

==Early life==
Biggs was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, making his sporting debut playing basketball at West Philadelphia High. He was a starting forward for the Speedboys&#x27; Public League and City champions in 1978, a team that extended a state-record winning streak to 68 before a regular season loss to Overbrook. In &#x27;77, one of Biggs&#x27; teammates was Gene Banks, who went on to excel at Duke and play in the NBA. After his initial boxing successes, he changed his name to &quot;Tyrell&quot;.

==Amateur career==

Biggs&#x27; first major success as an amateur boxer was winning the gold medal at the 1981 United States National Boxing Championships in the super-heavyweight division. He repeated this feat the next year, and also in 1982 he won the World Championships in Munich, West Germany, where in the final he defeated Francesco Damiani from Italy on points, who beat the legendary Cuban veteran Teofilo Stevenson earlier in the competition. In 1983, Biggs won a bronze medal at the Pan American Games, losing to future professional challenger Jorge Luis Gonzalez in the semi-final. In addition, Biggs won a 3–2 split decision over Cuban Angel Milian, who had beaten Greg Page five years earlier.

In 1984, Biggs won the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, defeating future Olympic gold medallist and professional world champion Lennox Lewis in the quarter-finals. In the gold medal bout, Biggs beat Damiani on points again.

Biggs finished his amateur career with an outstanding record of 108-6-4.

==Professional career==
He turned professional soon after his Olympic victory, scoring a 6-round unanimous decision over Mike Evans on November 15, 1984 at Madison Square Garden in New York City in his first bout. Besides Mike Tyson, Lewis and Damiani he went on to face such other boxing luminaries as James &quot;Quick&quot; Tillis, Ossie Ocasio, Riddick Bowe, Tony Tubbs, Buster Mathis, Jr., and Larry Donald before ending his career with a second-round knockout of Carlton Davis in 1998. He did not win a title, but stalked the rankings of contendership for much of the mid- to late 1980s.

===Biggs vs. Tyson===

Biggs&#x27; biggest professional fight was against Tyson, for the latter&#x27;s undisputed heavyweight title. Biggs and Tyson disliked each other, and Biggs derided Tyson before the fight. Biggs attempted to outbox Tyson, using his jab and movement. But Tyson kept coming in and landing big punches, wearing him down until the fight was stopped in the seventh. Tyson admitted after the fight to &quot;carrying&quot; Biggs so as to inflict more damage, in retaliation for Biggs&#x27; pre-match comments.
Unfortunately the talented Biggs&#x27; life has been a constant fight against drug and alcohol addiction. He had to enter rehabilitation only a few months after turning professional, and some declare that his career at the time of the Tyson fight was already effectively over. Biggs&#x27; robe was sometimes emblazoned with, &quot;Realize your potential&quot;, a drug rehabilitation mantra. An article published when he was 40 years old characterized him as &quot;still fighting between stints in rehabilitation.&quot;

==Outside the ring==
Biggs competed in the &quot;American Gladiators&quot; season 5 Gold Medal Challenge of Champions in 1993, losing to 1984 Gold Downhill Skiing medalist Bill Johnson. A feature documentary about Tyrell Biggs&#x27; life is currently in production.

<text>PSR J2144−3933 is a pulsar about 180 parsecs (587 light-years) from Earth. It is the coldest known neutron star with a surface temperature less than 42000 Kelvin as measured by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was previously thought to have a period of 2.84 seconds but is now known to have a period of 8.51 seconds, which is among the longest-known radio pulsar.

J2144−3933 is also notable for other reasons: its mean pulse profile is very narrow in comparison to the pulse period with a half-intensity width of less than one degree of longitude. It also has the lowest spindown luminosity of any pulsar at about 3×1021 watts.

Writing in &quot;Nature&quot;, astrophysicists M. D. Young and coworkers consider this object and suggest that its existence throws current theories into doubt. They state:

:&quot;Moreover, under the usual model assumptions, based on the neutron-star equations of state, this slowly rotating pulsar should not be emitting a radio beam. Therefore either the model assumptions are wrong, or current theories of radio emission must be revised&quot;

The fact that J2144−3933 is the coldest observed neutron star has been exploited to constrain the properties of dark matter.

<doc id="1302375" wikidata="Q2844588" url="?curid=1302375" title="Amy Weber">
<text>Amy Marie Weber (born July 2, 1970) is an American actress, model, film producer, singer, real estate broker and retired professional wrestling valet. She is best known for her time in WWE as a WWE Diva. She released an album, &quot;Let it Rain&quot;, the titular single for which stayed in the U.S. Billboard Chart for over a month. Weber has been the face of a Shiseido cosmetic campaign.

==Early career==
===Television===
Weber is currently the Director of Residential Estates at the famed brokerage &quot;Beverly &amp; Co.&quot; She has sold over $750,000,000 in her short 8 years in the real estate industry. Weber has been recognized by Los Angeles Magazine, Pasadena Magazine and The Wall Street Journal as an All-Star. Weber has played roles in numerous television series including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Son of the Beach&quot;, &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, &quot;Jenny&quot;, &quot;USA High&quot; and &quot;City Guys&quot;. She also appeared in country musician Toby Keith&#x27;s video for his song &quot;Whiskey Girl&quot; as the Whiskey Girl, and, on December 31, 2004, she was featured in a sketch on the New Year&#x27;s Eve live episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Weber teamed up with Tom Green who traveled all over New York City looking for someone to kiss him at midnight, which Weber eventually go to do.

===Film===
Weber has had lead roles in the movies &quot;Scarlet Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Bet&quot;, &quot;Dr. Life&quot;, &quot;Art House&quot;, &quot;Kolobos&quot;, &quot;The Contract&quot;, &quot;Starforce&quot;, &quot;Crackerjack III&quot;, &quot;Becoming Pony Boi&quot;, &quot;The Pumpkin Karver&quot;, and &quot;Transmorphers&quot;. She also had a lead role in the movie &quot;Diablita&quot;, and supporting roles in the movies &quot;The Adventures of Joe Dirt&quot; and &quot;Unbeatable Harold&quot;. She is also the executive producer and star of &quot;Crossroad&quot;. She was an associate producer on the film &quot;The Pumpkin Karver&quot;, in which she also starred.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Entertainment (2004–2005)===
A former WWE Diva Search contestant, Weber became a villainous diva for WWE&#x27;s SmackDown! brand, with a gimmick as John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL)&#x27;s image consultant in The Cabinet. During her time in The Cabinet, she feuded with Joy Giovanni, who she defeated by forfeit in her only match. She resigned from WWE in February 2005 because of her allegations of harassment from some of the wrestlers. She later stated that she &quot;wasn&#x27;t happy with the pay&quot; and the &quot;frat house-like&quot; environment. To explain her departure, JBL stated she had been &quot;fired&quot; for accidentally firing a sleeping dart at him the previous week while he was playing with an inflatable dinosaur. The dart was actually intended for JBL&#x27;s No Way Out 2005 opponent, Big Show.

In April 2020, Weber further explained that the allegations of being bullied by Edge and Randy Orton had led to her WWE exit in 2005

So when I got to Alaska, Shane McMahon was there, we were all getting our bags, and I was done,&quot; Weber said. &quot;I just felt like I couldn&#x27;t continue to be in an environment where people had no respect for me. They had their reasons, but I don&#x27;t think taking two ibuprofen is a reason for someone to call you names, try to physically harm you, and then pour a drink in your face. So that&#x27;s the story.
==Personal life==
Weber briefly dated rock guitarist Robbie Crane but while on The Howard Stern Show said she had to sue him in small claims court over $4000 he borrowed but didn&#x27;t pay back. Later, she was engaged to model/actor Dante Spencer in 2002 but ultimately married film producer David Dginger on May 17, 2008. The couple welcomed twins named Levi and Madison Grace on May 28, 2009.

Since leaving WWE, Weber has been working in modeling, movies, music, and eventually real estate businesses.

==Filmography==
===Film===
===Television===
===Music videos===
===Stage===
Weber has had starring roles in theater productions of &quot;Reservations for Two&quot;, &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;, &quot;Apocalyptic Butterflies&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, and &quot;Grease&quot;.

<text>Homo unius libri (&#x27;(a) man of one book&#x27;) is a Latin phrase attributed to Thomas Aquinas by bishop Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667), who claimed that Aquinas is reputed to have employed the phrase &quot;hominem unius libri timeo&quot; (&#x27;I fear the man of a single book&#x27;).

The poet Robert Southey recalled the tradition in which the quotation became embedded: 

The phrase was in origin a dismissal of eclecticism, i.e. the &quot;fear&quot; is of the formidable intellectual opponent who has dedicated himself to and become a master in a single chosen discipline. In this first sense, the phrase was invoked by Methodist founder John Wesley to refer to himself, with &quot;one book&quot; () taken to mean the Bible. However, the phrase today most often refers to the interpretation of expressing &quot;fear&quot; of the opinions of the illiterate man who has &quot;only read a single book&quot;.

<doc id="1302390" wikidata="Q800907" url="?curid=1302390" title="Heathrow Terminal 5 station">
<text>Heathrow Terminal 5 is a shared railway and London Underground station serving Heathrow Terminal 5. It serves as a terminus for Heathrow Express services to Paddington, and for Elizabeth line and London Underground Piccadilly line services to central London. It is managed and staffed by Heathrow Express.

The London Underground section of the station is situated in Travelcard Zone 6; it is the westernmost below-ground station on the network. It is also the westernmost National Rail station in London.

==History==
Following the longest public inquiry ever undertaken in the UK, construction of the station was granted in November 2001 by transport minister Stephen Byers as part of the approval of the Heathrow Terminal 5 project. The proposed terminal site was not welcomed by London Underground, as it would be impossible for all three stations to be served from the same route. Instead, twin tunnels would be built from Terminals 1, 2, 3 to the new terminal.

Construction of the extension as part of the T5 construction took 6 years, funded by British Airport Authority (BAA). As part of the construction, the Terminal 5 project team shut down two aircraft stands from Terminal 3 so that an access shaft could be constructed. The new junction was then built into a concrete box which connected all the underground tunnels. Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station was closed for 20 months between January 2005 and September 2006 to allow these connecting junctions to be constructed. Train testing started when the extension was handed over to London Underground on 18 July 2007.

The station opened on 27 March 2008 coinciding with that of Heathrow Terminal 5. It was designed by architects HOK in conjunction with Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. Although situated underground, parts of the station&#x27;s roofing are made of translucent ETFE laminate panels, allowing natural daylight to flood down both ends of all six platforms. 

Since May 2022, Heathrow Terminal 5 has been served by the Elizabeth line.

==Services==

Terminal 5 station is the only one at Heathrow Airport where Heathrow Express, Elizabeth line and Piccadilly line services share the same station. The following rail services are provided:
*Piccadilly line from platforms 5 and 6: half the trains on the Heathrow branch terminate here, via Hatton Cross and Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3. The other half do not serve Heathrow Terminal 5, running instead via the loop to service Heathrow Terminal 4 and Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3, before returning eastbound.
*Heathrow Express terminus to and from Paddington station from platforms 3 and 4.
*Elizabeth line terminus to and from Shenfield station from platforms 3 and 4.
===Free intra-terminal transfers===
Until 2012, free transfer was not possible between terminals via the Underground, unlike on the Heathrow Express. In January 2012, free travel was introduced for Oyster card and contactless payment card holders between the Heathrow stations on the Piccadilly line. Journeys from Heathrow Terminal 5 to Terminal 4 via the Piccadilly line require a change at Hatton Cross; this journey is free.

===Future links===
Network Rail has put forward a proposal for a Western Rail Approach to Heathrow, a short spur of track in tunnel which would run from a junction east of to Terminal 5 station. This would permit Great Western Main Line trains to run directly from and into Heathrow, without the need to change at Paddington. The proposal is currently at consultation stage and remains unconfirmed.

In addition to the above rail links, Terminal 5 station also has two safeguarded &quot;heavy rail&quot; platforms for use by a west-facing connection to the National Rail network. The south-leaning proposal would spur off the Waterloo to Reading Line west of Staines railway station (originally dubbed Heathrow Airtrack, with a newer proposal named Heathrow Southern Railway). It proposes direct rail services to London Waterloo, Reading, Woking, Guildford and Gatwick Airport. Due to the cost of replacing three level crossings, one in a very urban part of Egham, the proposals are currently unfunded.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 350, 423, 482, 490 and night route N9 serve the station. First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley, National Express and Oxford Bus Company also operate connecting bus and coach services.

<text>Threose is a four-carbon monosaccharide with molecular formula C4H8O4. It has a terminal aldehyde group, rather than a ketone, in its linear chain and so is considered part of the aldose family of monosaccharides. The threose name can be used to refer to both the - and -stereoisomers and more generally to the racemic mixture (/-, equal parts - and -) as well as to the more generic threose structure (absolute stereochemistry unspecified). 

The prefix &quot;threo-&quot; which derives from threose (and &quot;erythro-&quot; from a corresponding diastereomer erythrose) offer a useful way to describe general organic structures with adjacent chiral centers, where &quot;the prefixes... designate the relative configuration of the centers&quot;. As is depicted in a Fischer projection of -threose, the adjacent substituents will have a syn orientation in the isomer referred to as &quot;threo&quot;, and are anti in the isomer referred to as &quot;erythro&quot;.

Although often inconsequential, threose in aqueous solution mainly exists as the hydrate owing to the following equilibrium:

<doc id="1302406" wikidata="Q5208101" url="?curid=1302406" title="Dado rail">
<text>A dado rail, also known as a chair rail or surbase, is a type of moulding fixed horizontally to the wall around the perimeter of a room. The dado rail is traditionally part of the dado or wainscot and, although the purpose of the dado is mainly aesthetic, the dado rail may provide the wall with protection from furniture and other contact.

In cities such as Bath, England, the dado rail has been used in architecture to imply parts of the classical order. According to author Micahel Forsyth, &quot;The dado, including skirting and dado rail, represents the pedestal, the wall surface the column shaft, and the cornice the entablature.&quot;

Modern trends have been towards , based on the assumption that its purpose is to protect the wall from chair backs. The term &quot;chair rail&quot; is also used for this reason.

Dado rails are also sometimes applied to a wall without the full dado treatment. The purpose of the rail in these cases may be protective, and it is common in environments where walls are subject to much wear and tear, such as shopping centres and hospitals. In such cases the height of the rail is often or even from the floor and serves a functional rather than aesthetic role.

The dado rail is a decorative and functional architectural element that is designed to divide the wall into distinct sections and protect it from furniture or other potential sources of wear and tear. It can be used for colour blocking, additional definition and to pay homage to the original architectural details of the property.

== Materials and Construction ==
Dado rails are produced using a variety of materials, each offering unique benefits depending on the intended aesthetic and functional requirements:

* Wood: Traditional dado rails are crafted from solid hardwoods such as oak, pine, or mahogany. These materials are highly durable and lend a timeless appearance, making them particularly suitable for restoration projects and period properties.
* Medium-Density Fibreboard (MDF): MDF is a cost-effective and widely used material for dado rails in modern interiors. It is easy to cut, resistant to warping, and can be painted to suit a variety of décor styles.
* Plaster: In historical buildings, plaster dado rails are often molded directly onto walls, blending seamlessly with other decorative architectural features such as cornices and friezes.
* PVC or Plastic: Commonly used in commercial spaces or high-traffic areas like hospitals and shopping centers, these materials are durable and low-maintenance, prioritizing function over aesthetics.

=== Height and Installation ===
The placement of a dado rail is significant for achieving both aesthetic balance and functional utility. Traditionally, dado rails are installed at a height of to (35 to 47 inches) above the floor, aligning with the historical purpose of protecting walls from chair backs. However, modern applications may vary depending on the room&#x27;s proportions and design preferences.

One method for determining the ideal height involves dividing the total wall height by five and doubling the result. For instance:
* A wall height of divided by five equals . Doubling this value places the dado rail at approximately above the floor.

This calculation ensures visual harmony by dividing the wall into proportionate sections. For homeowners seeking precision, tools like dado rail height calculators can assist in determining optimal placement.

Dado rails may also be installed without the full dado or wainscot treatment, serving a purely decorative purpose or providing wall protection in areas subject to frequent wear and tear. For example, in high-traffic spaces like hallways or dining rooms, the material and height can be adjusted to match the room&#x27;s style and functional needs.

<doc id="1302407" wikidata="Q3231592" url="?curid=1302407" title="Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade">
<text>Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade (also known as The Les Claypool Frog Brigade) is a musical project with rotating personnel, led by American singer/bassist Les Claypool. The Frog Brigade was formed during a hiatus from Claypool&#x27;s main group Primus. 

The original band was formed in summer 2000 and consisted of Claypool, Todd Huth (guitars, vocals), Jay Lane (drums), Jeff Chimenti (keyboards), Skerik (saxophone), and Eenor Wildeboar (guitars, cümbüş). Les Claypool has described their sound as, &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a King Crimson meets Pink Floyd meets Frank Zappa type thing.&quot;

The band released two live recordings in 2001, &quot;Live Frogs Set 1&quot; and &quot;Live Frogs Set 2&quot;. &quot;Set 1&quot; is a mix of covers and originals, including &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; (King Crimson) and &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; (Pink Floyd). &quot;Set 2&quot; is a live cover of the entire Pink Floyd album, &quot;Animals&quot;. A studio album, entitled &quot;Purple Onion&quot;, was also released in 2002.

All three albums were released on Les Claypool&#x27;s Prawn Song Records.

==History==
Claypool formed the band to play the Mountain Aire Festival, a jam band festival that takes place in Northern California on Memorial Day weekends each year. Its initial lineup featured MIRV&#x27;s Marc Haggard on guitar, Skerik on saxophone, and both Jack Irons (ex-Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Primus&#x27; Tim Alexander on drums. Les had planned on naming the band Les Claypool&#x27;s Thunder Brigade, but was told by Mountain Aire organizers that the name might sound too heavy for the jam band crowd.

In August 2000, Claypool created a new line-up of the Frog Brigade and took it on a tour that fall. The band consisted of Jay Lane on drums and Todd Huth on guitar, who had worked with Claypool in Sausage (which in itself was a re-formation of the first line up of Primus), guitarist Eenor, who got a place in the band by winning a mail-order competition, Jeff Chimenti, the keyboardist from Ratdog (Jay Lane also has worked with Ratdog), and Skerik continuing on saxophone. This version of the band played a show consisting of two sets – the first filled with covers and songs from Claypool&#x27;s previous bands, and a second set where the band would play all of the Pink Floyd album, &quot;Animals&quot;.

Reviews noted that although Claypool was turning towards jam band, the cover selections were adventurous and the cross over brought together a unique combination of fans. At the shows it was noted &quot;a peculiar convergence of poncho punks, old Deadheads, extravagant funk fans and year-round Halloween revelers supplied one of the least likely rock audiences in recent memory&quot; including both deadhead &#x27;noodle dancers&#x27; and a mosh pit.

After this tour, the Brigade released two live recordings, both taken from the Autumn 2000 concerts by the band in San Francisco. &quot;Live Frogs, Vol. 1&quot; contained material from the first, free-form set, and &quot;Live Frogs, Vol. 2&quot; was a recording of the band performing &quot;Animals&quot;.

The Brigade headlined the first SnoCore Icicle Ball in early 2001. The following summer, the band was composed of Claypool, Skerik, Eenor and a new drummer, Paul Svena. Les began writing new material and they began playing single-set live shows. In 2002, Mike Dillon was added as a percussionist and the Frog Brigade recorded their only studio album to date, &quot;Purple Onion&quot;.

In 2003, Eenor left the band and guitarist Bryan Kehoe joined. Throughout their touring schedule the band has changed drummers multiple times. Drummer Paulo Baldi also entered the rotation in 2003. Baldi, formerly of the Bay Area trio Deadweight, who have disbanded, is a natural fit along the lines of Tim Alexander and Jay Lane.

In 2002, Claypool formed a new band, Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains, with guitarist Buckethead, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, and former Primus drummer Bryan Mantia (aka Brain). This band had much the same genesis as the Frog Brigade; Formed to play at the Bonnaroo Festival of that year, it has since gone on the road, and recordings have become subsequent live albums.

As of August 2011, the Frog Brigade has not recorded any new material since Purple Onion, and the band has not gone on a major tour since Summer 2003, but has occasionally re-formed to play other one-off shows and music festivals. Claypool toured 2006 and 2007 with Paulo Baldi, Gabby La La, Mike Dillon and Skerik as Les Claypool&#x27;s Fancy Band.

In 2023, Claypool reformed the band for a tour entitled &quot;Summer of Green,&quot; featuring an almost entirely new line up of Sean Lennon on guitar, Harry Waters on keyboards, Paulo Baldi on drums, and Mike Dillon on percussion. Skerik was the only original member aside from Claypool set to rejoin the reformed group; however, Skerik was forced to bow out of the tour due to a mysterious shoulder/neck injury.

<text>-Erythrulose (also known as erythrulose) is a tetrose carbohydrate with the chemical formula C4H8O4. It has one ketone group and so is part of the ketose family. It is used in some self-tanning cosmetics, in general, combined with dihydroxyacetone (DHA).

Erythrulose/DHA reacts with the amino acids in the proteins of the first layers of skin (the stratum corneum and epidermis). One of the pathways involves free radicals at one of the steps of the Maillard reaction, distantly related to the browning effect when a cut apple slice is exposed to oxygen. The other pathway is the conventional Maillard reaction; both pathways are involved in the browning during food preparation and storage. This is not a stain or dye, but rather a chemical reaction that produces a color change on all treated skin. It does not involve the underlying skin pigmentation nor does it require exposure to ultraviolet light to initiate the color change. However, the &#x27;tan&#x27; produced by erythrulose/DHA only has an SPF of up to 3, and &quot;enhances&quot; the free radical injury from UV (compared to untreated skin) for the 24 hours after self-tanner is applied, according to a 2007 study led by Katinka Jung of the Gematria Test Lab in Berlin. Forty minutes after the researchers treated skin samples with high levels of erythrulose, they found that more than 140 percent additional free radicals formed during sun exposure compared with untreated skin.

DHA produced similar results, but faster; however erythrulose takes longer to develop its full effect, therefore it lasts longer. For a day after self-tanner application, excessive sun exposure should be avoided and sunscreen should be worn outdoors, they say; an antioxidant cream could also minimize free radical production. Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last as long as the tan. During UV irradiation free radicals, mainly superoxide/hydroperoxyl (O2•−/HO2•), and other reactive species (ROS/RNS) are produced, that can react with the ketoamines (Amadori products) and other intermediates of the Maillard reaction. This leads to autoxidationradical chain reactions of the ketoamines, which cause a dramatic increase in the radical injury of the skin. This can be suppressed by antioxidants, which shows involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ketoamines were shown to cause DNA strand breaks and to act as mutagens.

The free radicals are due to the action of UV light on AGE (advanced glycation end-products) as a result of the reaction of DHA with the skin, and the intermediates, such as Amadori products (a type of AGE), that lead to them. AGEs absorb UV light, but do not have melanin&#x27;s extended electronic structure that dissipates the energy, so part of it goes towards starting free radical chain reactions instead, in which other AGEs participate readily. AGEs are behind the damage to the skin that occurs with high blood sugar in diabetes where similar glycation occurs.

Erythrulose is a clear to pale-yellowish liquid, which naturally occurs in red raspberries. According to one method, it is made through aerobic fermentation by the bacterium &quot;Gluconobacter&quot;, followed by extensive multi-step purification.

Erythrulose and dihydroxyacetone (DHA) are very similar in composition, and both react much the same way on the skin surface. Erythrulose produces a lighter and slower-developing tan, taking 24 to 48 hours to complete development. When used alone, it fades faster than a DHA-based sunless tan. Some people feel the final tone of erythrulose is slightly redder, and less bronze, than the DHA-based tan. It may be less drying to the skin surface, helping provide a smoother fading tint. When combined with DHA, the resulting sunless tan is said to last longer, fade better, and provide a more cosmetically pleasing color tone. In sunless tanning products, it is incorporated at 1% to 3% levels.

Because the skin continually exfoliates itself, losing thousands of dead surface skin cells each day, the tan hue is temporary. The tan appearance lasts from two to 10 days, depending on application type and skin condition.

Not all users develop a tan coloration from erythrulose; some may find their fading is more uneven and blotchy when this ingredient is used. Because of the added cost associated with this ingredient, some manufacturers feel it is an inefficient additive to the sunless tanning product line.

Individuals sensitive to DHA may be able to use erythrulose as a skin-safe self-tanning replacement. Erythrulose is more expensive, and difficult to obtain.

Erythrulose is not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a self-tanning agent.

<text>A web service protocol stack is a protocol stack (a stack of computer networking protocols) that is used to define, locate, implement, and make Web services interact with each other. A web service protocol stack typically stacks four protocols:

* (Service) Transport Protocol: responsible for transporting messages between network applications and includes protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, as well as the more recent Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP).
* (XML) Messaging Protocol: responsible for encoding messages in a common XML format so that they can be understood at either end of a network connection. Currently, this area includes such protocols as XML-RPC, WS-Addressing, and SOAP.
* (Service) Description Protocol: used for describing the public interface to a specific Web service. The WSDL interface format is typically used for this purpose.
* (Service) Discovery Protocol: centralizes services into a common registry so that network Web services can publish their location and description, and makes it easy to discover what services are available on the network. Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) was intended for this purpose, but it has not been widely adopted.

The protocol stack can also include a range of higher-level protocols such as Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) or WS-Security for security extensions.
