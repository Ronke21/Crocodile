<text>Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS), sometimes shortened to Disney Animation, is an American animation studio that produces animated feature films and short films for the Walt Disney Company. The studio&#x27;s current production logo features a scene from its first synchronized sound cartoon, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928). Founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney after the closure of Laugh-O-Gram Studio, it is the longest-running animation studio in the world. It is currently organized as a division of Walt Disney Studios and is headquartered at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California. Since its foundation, the studio has produced 63 feature films, from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), which is also the first hand drawn animated feature film, to &quot;Moana 2&quot; (2024), and hundreds of short films.

Founded as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio (DBCS) in 1923, renamed Walt Disney Studio (WDS) in 1926 and incorporated as Walt Disney Productions (WDP) in 1929, the studio was dedicated to producing short films until it entered feature production in 1934, resulting in 1937&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, one of the first full-length animated feature films and the first U.S.-based one. In 1986, during a large corporate restructuring, Walt Disney Productions, which had grown from a single animation studio into an international media conglomerate, was renamed the Walt Disney Company and the animation studio became Walt Disney Feature Animation (WDFA) in order to differentiate it from the company&#x27;s other divisions. Its current name was adopted in 2006 after Pixar Animation Studios was acquired by Disney.

For many people, Disney Animation is synonymous with animation, for &quot;in no other medium has a single company&#x27;s practices been able to dominate aesthetic norms&quot; to such an overwhelming extent. The studio was recognized as the premier American animation studio for much of its existence and was &quot;for many decades the undisputed world leader in animated features&quot;; it developed many of the techniques, concepts and principles that became standard practices of traditional animation. The studio also pioneered the art of storyboarding, which is now a standard technique used in both animated and live-action filmmaking, as well as television shows and video games. The studio&#x27;s catalog of animated features is among Disney&#x27;s most notable assets, with the stars of its animated shorts—Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, and Pluto—becoming recognizable figures in popular culture and mascots for the Walt Disney Company as a whole.

Three of the studio&#x27;s films—&quot;Frozen&quot; (2013), &quot;Frozen 2&quot; (2019), and the aforementioned &quot;Moana 2&quot;—are all among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, with &quot;Frozen 2&quot; becoming the fourth-highest-grossing animated feature film of all time.

By 2013, the studio had no hand-drawn animated features in development as a result of their computer animated films performing better at the box office, and had laid off a large portion of their hand-drawn animators. However, the studio stated in 2019 and 2023 that they are open to proposals from filmmakers for future hand-drawn feature projects. In addition, in April 2022, Eric Goldberg, one of the studio&#x27;s hand-drawn animators who has been working with the studio since 1992, confirmed plans within the Disney studio to once again return to hand-drawn animation.

==History==
===1923–1929: Early years===

Kansas City, Missouri, natives Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney founded Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in Los Angeles in 1923 and got their start producing a series of silent &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; short films featuring a live-action child actress in an animated world. The &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; were distributed by Margaret J. Winkler&#x27;s Winkler Pictures, which later also distributed a second Disney short subject series, the all-animated &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;, through Universal Pictures starting in 1927. Upon relocating to California, the Disney brothers initially started working in their uncle Robert Disney&#x27;s garage at 4406 Kingswell Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, then, in October 1923, formally launched their studio in a small office on the rear side of a real estate agency&#x27;s office at 4651 Kingswell Avenue. In February 1924, the studio moved next door to office space of its own at 4649 Kingswell Avenue. In 1925, Disney put down a deposit on a new location at 2719 Hyperion Avenue in the nearby Silver Lake neighborhood, which came to be known as the Hyperion Studio to distinguish it from the studio&#x27;s other locations, and, in January 1926, the studio moved there and took on the name Walt Disney Studio.

Meanwhile, after the first year&#x27;s worth of &quot;Oswalds&quot;, Walt Disney attempted to renew his contract with Winkler Pictures, but Charles Mintz, who had taken over Margaret Winkler&#x27;s business after marrying her, wanted to force Disney to accept a lower advance payment for each &quot;Oswald&quot; short. Disney refused and, as Universal owned the rights to &quot;Oswald&quot; rather than Disney, Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce &quot;Oswald&quot; cartoons. Most of Disney&#x27;s staff was hired away by Mintz to move over once Disney&#x27;s &quot;Oswald&quot; contract expired in mid-1928.

Working in secret while the rest of the staff finished the remaining &quot;Oswalds&quot; on contract, Disney and his head animator Ub Iwerks led a small handful of loyal staffers in producing cartoons starring a new character named Mickey Mouse. The first two &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoons, &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Galloping Gaucho&quot;, were previewed in limited engagements during the summer of 1928. For the third &quot;Mickey&quot; cartoon, however, Disney produced a soundtrack, collaborating with musician Carl Stalling and businessman Pat Powers, who provided Disney with his bootlegged &quot;Cinephone&quot; sound-on-film process. Subsequently, the third &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoon, &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, became Disney&#x27;s first cartoon with synchronized sound and was a major success upon its November 1928 debut at the West 57th Theatre in New York City. The &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; series of sound cartoons, distributed by Powers through Celebrity Productions, quickly became the most popular cartoon series in the United States.
A second Disney series of sound cartoons, &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;, debuted in 1929 with &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot;. In total, five different shorts from the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series were released by the end of 1929. All were scored by Stalling and involved animation by Iwerks.

===1929–1940: Reincorporation, &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;===
In 1929, disputes over finances between Disney and Powers led to Disney&#x27;s animation production company, reincorporated on December 16, 1929, as Walt Disney Productions, signing a new distribution contract with Columbia Pictures. Powers, in return, signed away Ub Iwerks, who began producing cartoons at his own studio, although he would return to Disney in 1940.

Columbia distributed Disney&#x27;s shorts for two years before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process, which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not. The result was the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot;, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor. &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; was a major success and all &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; were subsequently produced in Technicolor.

By the early 1930s, Walt Disney had realized that the success of animated films depended upon telling emotionally gripping stories that would grab the audience and not let go, and this realization led him to create a separate &quot;story department&quot; with storyboard artists dedicated to story development. With well-developed characters and an interesting story, the 1933 Technicolor &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; became a major box office and pop culture success, with its theme song &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot; becoming a popular chart hit.

In 1934, Walt Disney gathered several key staff members and announced his plans to make his first animated feature film. Despite derision from most of the film industry, who dubbed the production &quot;Disney&#x27;s Folly&quot;, Disney proceeded undaunted into the production of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, which would become the first animated feature in English and Technicolor. Considerable training and development went into the production of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and the studio greatly expanded, with established animators, artists from other fields and recent college graduates joining the studio to work on the film. The training classes, supervised by head animators such as Les Clark, Norm Ferguson and Art Babbit and taught by Donald W. Graham, an art teacher from the nearby Chouinard Art Institute, had begun at the studio in 1932 and were greatly expanded into orientation training and continuing education classes. In the course of teaching the classes, Graham and the animators created or formalized many of the techniques and processes that became the key tenets and principles of traditional animation. &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; such as &quot;The Goddess of Spring&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Old Mill&quot; (1937) served as experimentation grounds for new techniques such as the animation of realistic human figures, special effects animation and the use of the multiplane camera, an invention that split animation artwork layers into several planes, allowing the camera to appear to move dimensionally through an animated scene.

&quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; cost Disney a then-expensive sum of $1.4 million to complete (including $100,000 on story development alone) and was an unprecedented success when released in February 1938 by RKO Radio Pictures, which had assumed distribution of Disney product from United Artists in 1937. It was briefly the highest-grossing film of all time before the unprecedented success of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; two years later, grossing over $8 million on its initial release, the equivalent of $ in 1999 dollars.

During the production of &quot;Snow White&quot;, work had continued on the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series of shorts. &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey&#x27;s dog, Pluto, and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; cartoons eclipsed the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; series in popularity. &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;, which garnered seven Academy Awards, ceased in 1939, until the shorts returned to theatres with some re-issues and re-releases.

===1940–1948: New feature films, strike and World War II===
The success of &quot;Snow White&quot; allowed Disney to build a new, larger studio on Buena Vista Street in Burbank, where the Walt Disney Company remains headquartered to this day. Walt Disney Productions had its initial public offering on April 2, 1940, with Walt Disney as president and Roy Disney as CEO.

The studio launched into the production of new animated features, the first of which was &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, released in February 1940. &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was not initially a box office success. The box office returns from the film&#x27;s initial release were below both &quot;Snow White&quot;&#x27;s unprecedented success and the studio&#x27;s expectations. Of the film&#x27;s $2.289 million cost – twice of &quot;Snow White&quot; – Disney recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film&#x27;s final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. However, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was a critical success, winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Best Original Score, making it the first film of the studio to win not only either Oscar, but both at the same time.

&quot;Fantasia&quot;, an experimental film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski, was released in November 1940 by Disney itself in a series of limited-seating roadshow engagements. The film cost $2 million to produce and, although the film earned $1.4 million in its roadshow engagements, the high cost ($85,000 per theater) of installing Fantasound placed &quot;Fantasia&quot; at a greater loss than &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. RKO assumed distribution of &quot;Fantasia&quot; in 1941, later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years. Despite its financial failure, &quot;Fantasia&quot; was the subject of two Academy Honorary Awards on February 26, 1942 – one for the development of the innovative Fantasound system used to create the film&#x27;s stereoscopic soundtrack, and the other for Stokowski and his contributions to the film. &quot;Fantasia&quot; was the final Disney animated film to be completed at the Hyperion Studio of the Walt Disney Studios (Walt Disney Productions) in Los Angeles.

Much of the character animation on these productions and all subsequent features until the late 1970s was supervised by a brain-trust of animators Walt Disney dubbed the &quot;Nine Old Men&quot;, many of whom also served as directors and later producers on the Disney features: Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Woolie Reitherman, Les Clark, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Milt Kahl, and Marc Davis. Other head animators at Disney during this period included Norm Ferguson, Bill Tytla and Fred Moore. The development of the feature animation department created a caste system at the Disney studio: lesser animators (and feature animators in-between assignments) were assigned to work on the short subjects, while animators higher in status such as the Nine Old Men worked on the features. Concern over Walt Disney accepting credit for the artists&#x27; work as well as debates over compensation led to many of the newer and lower-ranked animators seeking to unionize the Disney studio.
A bitter union strike began in May 1941, which was resolved without the angered Walt Disney&#x27;s involvement in July and August of that year. As Walt Disney Productions was being set up as a union shop, Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the U.S. government on a Good Neighbor policy trip to Central and South America. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Melendez, and John Hubley. Hubley, along with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney&#x27;s key animation rival in the 1950s.

&quot;Dumbo&quot;, in production during the midst of the animators&#x27; strike, premiered in October 1941 and proved to be a financial success. The film cost $950,000 to produce, half the cost of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, less than a third of the cost of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and two-fifths of the cost of &quot;Fantasia&quot;. &quot;Dumbo&quot; eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. &quot;Dumbo&quot; was the first Disney animated film to be completed at the original Animation Building of the Walt Disney Studios (Walt Disney Productions) in Burbank, California. In August 1942, &quot;Bambi&quot; was released and, as with &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;, did not perform well at the box office. Out of its $1.7 million budget, it grossed $1.64 million.

Production of full-length animated features was temporarily suspended after the release of &quot;Bambi&quot;. Given the financial failures of some of the recent features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market, the studio&#x27;s financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production. Features then in production such as &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; were therefore put on hold until after the war. Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the studio housed over 500 U.S. Army soldiers who were responsible for protecting nearby aircraft factories from enemy bombers. In addition, several Disney animators were drafted to fight in the war and the studio was contracted on producing wartime content for every branch of the U.S. military, particularly military training, and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio&#x27;s animation output was for the military. During the war, Disney produced the live-action/animated military propaganda feature &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot; (1943), and a series of Latin culture-themed shorts resulting from the 1941 Good Neighbor trip were compiled into two features, &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944).

&quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; set the template for several other 1940s Disney releases of &quot;package films&quot;: low-budgeted films composed of animated short subjects with animated or live-action bridging material. These films were &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; (1946), &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947), &quot;Melody Time&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; (1949). The studio also produced two features, &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946) and &quot;So Dear to My Heart&quot; (1948), which used more expansive live-action stories which still included animated sequences and sequences combining live-action and animated characters. Song of the South, however, would go on to have historical notability due to its now controversial depiction of happy plantation workers. These depictions were wrong then and were wrong now, and due to this, the film is not available on Disney+. Shorts production continued during this period as well, with &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Goofy&quot;, and &quot;Pluto&quot; cartoons being the main output accompanied by cartoons starring Mickey Mouse, Figaro and, in the 1950s, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale and Humphrey the Bear.

In addition, Disney began reissuing the previous features, beginning with re-releases of &quot;Snow White&quot; in 1944, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; in 1945, and &quot;Fantasia&quot; in 1946. This led to a tradition of reissuing the Disney films every seven years, which lasted into the 1990s before being translated into the studio&#x27;s handling of home video releases.

===1948–1966: Return of feature films, Buena Vista, end of shorts, layoffs and Walt&#x27;s final years===

In 1948, Disney returned to the production of full-length features with &quot;Cinderella&quot;, a feature film based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. At a cost of nearly $3 million, the future of the studio depended upon the success of this film. Upon its release in 1950, &quot;Cinderella&quot; proved to be a box-office success, with the profits from the film&#x27;s release allowing Disney to carry on producing animated features throughout the 1950s. Following its success, production on the in-limbo features &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was resumed. In addition, an ambitious new project, an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; set to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s classic score, was begun but took much of the rest of the decade to complete.

&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, released in 1951, met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, released in 1953, on the other hand, was a commercial success and the sixth highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was released to higher box office success than any other Disney animated feature since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, earning an estimated $6.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; is significant as Disney&#x27;s first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney&#x27;s own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.
By the mid-1950s, with Walt Disney&#x27;s attention primarily set on new endeavours such as live-action films, television and the Disneyland theme park, production of the animated films was left primarily in the hands of the &quot;Nine Old Men&quot; trust of head animators and directors. This led to several delays in approvals during the production of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, which was finally released in 1959. At $6 million, it was Disney&#x27;s most expensive film to date, produced in a heavily stylised art style devised by artist Eyvind Earle and presented in large-format Super Technirama 70 with six-track stereophonic sound. However, despite being the studio&#x27;s highest-grossing animated feature since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, the film&#x27;s large production costs and the box office underperformance of Disney&#x27;s other 1959 output resulted in the studio posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, leading to massive layoffs throughout the studio.

By the end of the decade, the Disney short subjects were no longer being produced on a regular basis, with many of the shorts divisions&#x27; personnel either leaving the company or being reassigned to work on Disney television programs such as &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; and &quot;Disneyland&quot;. While the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) during the 1930s, the studio&#x27;s reign over the most awards had been ended by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, Warner Bros. Cartoons&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, and the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives to the older Disney style. During the 1950s, only one Disney short, the stylized &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot;, won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar.

The &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Pluto&quot; and &quot;Goofy&quot; shorts had all ceased regular production by 1953, with &quot;Donald Duck&quot; and &quot;Humphrey&quot; continuing and converting to widescreen CinemaScope before the shorts division was shut down in 1956. After that, all future shorts were produced by the feature films division until 1969. The last Disney short of the golden age of American animation was &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bird&quot;. Disney shorts would only be produced on a sporadic basis from this point on, with notable later shorts including &quot;Runaway Brain&quot; (1995, starring Mickey Mouse) and &quot;Paperman&quot; (2012).

Despite the 1959 layoffs and competition for Walt Disney&#x27;s attention from the company&#x27;s expanded live-action film, TV and theme park departments, production continued on feature animation productions at a reduced level.

In 1961, the studio released &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, an animated feature that popularized the use of xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels. Using xerography, animation drawings could be photochemically transferred rather than traced from paper drawings to the clear acetate sheets (&quot;cels&quot;) used in final animation production. The resulting art style – a scratchier line which revealed the construction lines in the animators&#x27; drawings – typified Disney films into the 1980s. The film was a success, being the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961 with rentals of $6.4 million.

The Disney animation training program started at the studio in 1932 before the development of &quot;Snow White&quot; eventually led to Walt Disney helping found the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). This university formed via the merger of Chouinard Art Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. It included a Disney-developed animation program of study among its degree offerings. CalArts became the alma mater of many of the animators who would work at Disney and other animation studios from the 1970s to the present.

&quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; was released in 1963 and was the sixth highest-grossing film of the year in North America with estimated rentals of $4.75 million. A featurette adaptation of one of A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; stories, &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;, was released in 1966, to be followed by several other &quot;Pooh&quot; featurettes over the years and a full-length compilation feature, &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, which was released in 1977.

Walt Disney died in December 1966, ten months before the studio&#x27;s next film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, was completed and released. The film was a success, finishing 1967 as the fourth highest-grossing film of the year.

===1966–1984: Decline in popularity; Don Bluth&#x27;s entrance and departure===
Following Walt Disney&#x27;s death, Wolfgang Reitherman continued as both producer and director of the studio&#x27;s feature films. It was Reitherman who was responsible for a noticeable softening of the Disney villains. Over the next two decades, nearly all Disney villains were more comical or pitiful rather than scary. Reitherman&#x27;s main priority was ensuring that the studio would continue to turn a profit and towards that end, he stressed the importance of making family-friendly films. According to Andreas Deja, Reitherman said that &quot;if we lose the kids, we lose everything&quot;.

The studio began the 1970s with the release of &quot;The Aristocats&quot;, the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms until 1978. The next feature, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features. Both &quot;The Aristocats&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood&quot; were minor box office and critical successes.

&quot;The Rescuers&quot;, released in 1977, was a success exceeding the achievements of the previous two Disney features. Receiving positive reviews, high commercial returns, and an Academy Award nomination, it ended up being the third highest-grossing film of the year and the most successful and best reviewed Disney animated film since &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. The film was reissued in 1983, accompanied by a new Disney featurette, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;.

The production of &quot;The Rescuers&quot; signaled the beginning of a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio, as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired; they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker and Glen Keane. The new animators, selected from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Woolie Reitherman, got their first chance to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney&#x27;s live-action/animated hybrid feature &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977), the animation for which was directed by Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation in the development of the art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney&#x27;s chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.

Delayed half a year by the defection of the Bluth group, &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; was released in 1981 after four years in production. The film was considered a financial success by the studio, and development continued on &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, a long-gestating adaptation of the &quot;Chronicles of Prydain&quot; series of novels by Lloyd Alexander produced in Super Technirama 70.

&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was intended to expand the appeal of Disney animated films to older audiences and to showcase the talents of the new generation of Disney animators from CalArts. Besides Keane, Musker and Clements, this new group of artists included other promising animators such as Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel, John Lasseter, Brad Bird and Tim Burton. Lasseter was fired from Disney in 1983 for pushing the studio to explore computer animation production, but went on to become the creative head of Pixar, a pioneering computer animation studio that would begin a close association with Disney in the late 1980s. Similarly, Burton was fired in 1984 after producing a live-action short shelved by the studio, &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, then went on to become a high-profile producer and director of live-action and stop-motion features for Disney and other studios. Some of Burton&#x27;s high-profile projects for Disney would include the stop-motion &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993), a live-action adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010), and a stop-motion feature remake of &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (2012). Bird was also fired after a few years working at the company for criticizing Disney&#x27;s upper management as he felt that they were playing it safe and not taking risks on animation. He subsequently became an animation director at other studios, including Warner Bros. Animation and Pixar.

Ron Miller, Walt Disney&#x27;s son-in-law, became president of Walt Disney Productions in 1980 and CEO in 1983. That year, he expanded the company&#x27;s film and television production divisions, creating the Walt Disney Pictures banner under which future films from the feature animation department would be released.

===1984–1989: Restructuring and new projects for prominence===

After a series of corporate takeover attempts in 1984, Roy E. Disney, son of Roy O. and nephew of Walt, resigned from the company&#x27;s board of directors and launched a campaign called &quot;SaveDisney&quot;, successfully convincing the board to fire Miller. Roy E. Disney brought in Michael Eisner as Disney&#x27;s new CEO and Frank Wells as president. Eisner in turn named Jeffrey Katzenberg chairman of the film division, The Walt Disney Studios. Near completion when the Eisner regime took over Disney, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985) came to represent what would later be referred to as the &quot;rock bottom&quot; point for Disney animation. The studio&#x27;s most expensive feature to that point at $44 million, &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was a critical and commercial failure. The film&#x27;s $21 million box office gross led to a loss for the studio, putting the future of the animation department in jeopardy.

Between the 1950s and 1980s, the significance of animation to Disney&#x27;s bottom line was significantly reduced as the company expanded into further live-action production, television and theme parks. As new CEO, Michael Eisner strongly considered shuttering the feature animation studio and outsourcing future animation. Roy E. Disney intervened, offering to head the feature animation division and turn its fortunes around, while Eisner established the Walt Disney Pictures Television Animation Group to produce lower-cost animation for television. Named Chairman of feature animation by Eisner, Roy E. Disney appointed Peter Schneider president of animation to run the day-to-day operations in 1985.

On February 1, 1985, Disney executives began to move the animation department from the Disney studio lot in Burbank to a variety of warehouses, hangars and trailers located about east at 1420 Flower Street in nearby Glendale, California. About a year later, the growing computer graphics (CG) group would move there too.

The animation department&#x27;s first feature animation at its new location was &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), begun by John Musker and Ron Clements as &quot;Basil of Baker Street&quot; after both left production of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;. The film was enough of a critical and commercial success to instill executive confidence in the animation studio. Later the same year, however, Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment released Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot;, which outgrossed &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; at the box office and became the highest-grossing first-issue animated film to that point.

Katzenberg, Schneider, and Roy Disney set about changing the culture of the studio, increasing staffing and production so that a new animated feature would be released every year instead of every two to four. The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), which featured an all-star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack. &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; opened in the theaters on the same day as another Bluth/Amblin/Universal animated film, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;. &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; outgrossed &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; in the U.S. and went on to become the most successful animated feature in the U.S. to that date, though the latter&#x27;s worldwide box office gross was higher than the former.

At the same time in 1988, Disney started entering into Australia&#x27;s long-standing animation industry by purchasing Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Australian studio to start Disney Animation Australia.

While &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; and the next feature &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; were in production, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment and master animator Richard Williams to produce &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, a groundbreaking live-action/animation hybrid directed by Robert Zemeckis, which featured licensed animated characters from other studios (such as Warner Bros., MGM, and Universal). Disney set up a new animation studio under Williams&#x27; supervision in London to create the cartoon characters for &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;, with many of the artists from the California studio traveling to England to work on the film. A significant critical and commercial success, &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; won three Academy Awards for technical achievements. and was key in renewing mainstream interest in American animation. Other than the film itself, the studio also produced three &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; shorts during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

===1989–1994: Beginning of the Disney Renaissance, success &amp; impact===

A second satellite studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, opened in 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were located within the Disney/MGM Studios Theme Park theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and visitors were allowed to tour the studio and observe animators at work. That same year, the studio released &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which became a keystone achievement in Disney&#x27;s history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who had been co-directors on &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for the studio. The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, who was also a co-producer and story consultant on the film. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.

&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; vigorously relaunched a profound new interest in the animation and musical film genres. The film was also the first to feature the use of Disney&#x27;s Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS/ink-and-paint would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was the first of a series of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance. The Renaissance era also saw the studio return to making films with darker themes and scarier villains, similar to the films it had made when Walt Disney was still alive.

Accompanied in theaters by the Mickey Mouse featurette &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990) was Disney&#x27;s first animated feature sequel and the studio&#x27;s first film to be fully colored and composited via computer using the CAPS/ink-and-paint system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. The next Disney animated feature, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the songs and score, though Ashman died before production was completed.

Debuting first in a work-in-progress version at the 1991 New York Film Festival before its November 1991 wide release, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, was an unprecedented critical and commercial success and would later be regarded as one of the studio&#x27;s best films. The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, a first for an animated work, winning for Best Song and Best Original Score. Its $145 million box office gross set new records, and merchandising for the film, including toys, cross-promotions, and soundtrack sales, was also lucrative.

The successes of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; established the template for future Disney releases during the 1990s: a musical-comedy format with Broadway-styled songs and tentpole action sequences, buoyed by cross-promotional marketing and merchandising, all carefully designed to pull audiences of all ages and types into theatres. In addition to John Musker, Ron Clements, Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, the new guard of Disney artists creating these films included story artists/directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff, Chris Sanders and Brenda Chapman, and lead animators Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Nik Ranieri, Will Finn and many others.

&quot;Aladdin&quot;, released in November 1992, continued the upward trend in Disney&#x27;s animation success, earning $504 million worldwide at the box office, and two more Oscars for Best Song and Best Score. Featuring songs by Menken, Ashman and Tim Rice (who replaced Ashman after his death) and starring the voice of Robin Williams, &quot;Aladdin&quot; also established the trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices of Disney characters, which had been explored to some degree with &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, but now became standard practice.

In June 1994, Disney released &quot;The Lion King&quot;, directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. An all-animal story set in Africa, &quot;The Lion King&quot; featured an all-star voice cast which included James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick and Jeremy Irons, with songs written by Tim Rice and pop star Elton John. &quot;The Lion King&quot; earned $768 million at the worldwide box office, to this date a record for a traditionally-animated film, earning millions more in merchandising, promotions and record sales for its soundtrack.
&quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; had been the highest-grossing films worldwide in each of their respective release years. Between these in-house productions, Disney diversified in animation methods and produced &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; with former Disney animator Tim Burton; Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed by providing the film&#x27;s second-layering traditional animation. With animation becoming again an increasingly important and lucrative part of Disney&#x27;s business, the company began to expand its operations. The flagship California studio was split into two units and expanded, and ground was broken on a new Disney Feature Animation building adjacent to the main Disney lot in Burbank, which was dedicated in 1995. also one of Disney&#x27;s television animation studios in the Paris, France suburb of Montreuil – the former Brizzi Brothers studio – became Walt Disney Feature Animation Paris, where &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995) and significant parts of later Disney films were produced. Disney also began producing lower cost direct-to-video sequels and prequels for its successful animated films using the services of its television animation studios under the name Disney MovieToons. &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; (1994), a sequel to &quot;Aladdin&quot; and a pilot for the &quot;Aladdin&quot; television show spin-off, was the first of these productions. Walt Disney Feature Animation was also heavily involved in the adaptations of both &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 1994 and &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 1997 into Broadway musicals.

Jeffrey Katzenberg and the Disney story team were heavily involved in the development and production of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the first fully computer-animated feature ever produced. &quot;Toy Story&quot; was produced for Disney by Pixar and directed by former Disney animator John Lasseter, whom Peter Schneider had unsuccessfully tried to hire back after his success with Pixar shorts such as &quot;Tin Toy&quot; (1988). Released in 1995, &quot;Toy Story&quot; opened to critical acclaim and commercial success, leading to Pixar signing a five-film deal with Disney, which bore critically and financially successful computer animated films such as &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001), &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004).

In addition, the successes of &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; spurred a significant increase in the number of American-produced animated features throughout the rest of the decade, with the major film studios establishing new animation divisions such as Fox Animation Studios, Sullivan Bluth Studios (both founded by Don Bluth), Amblimation, Rich Animation Studios, Turner Feature Animation, and Warner Bros. Feature Animation being formed to produce films in a Disney-esque musical-comedy format such as &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; (1993), &quot;Thumbelina&quot; (1994), &quot;The Swan Princess&quot; (1994), &quot;A Troll in Central Park&quot; (1994), &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot; (1995), &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1997), &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997), &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; (1998), and &quot;The King and I&quot; (1999). Out of these non-Disney animated features, only &quot;Anastasia&quot; was a box office success, and it later ended up being acquired by Disney through the company&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019.

===1994–1999: Late Disney Renaissance and declining returns===
Concerns arose internally at the Disney studio, particularly from Roy E. Disney, about studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg taking too much credit for the success of Disney&#x27;s early 1990s releases. Disney Company president Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter accident in 1994, and Katzenberg lobbied CEO Michael Eisner for the vacant president position. Instead, tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner and Disney resulted in Katzenberg being forced to resign from the company on August 24 of that year, with Joe Roth taking his place. On October 12, 1994, Katzenberg went on to become one of the founders of DreamWorks SKG, whose animation division became Disney&#x27;s key rival in feature animation, with both computer animated films such as &quot;Antz&quot; (1998) and traditionally-animated films such as &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998). In December 1994, the Animation Building in Burbank was completed for the animation division.

In contrast to the early 1990s productions, not all the films in the second half of the renaissance were successful. &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, released in the summer of 1995, was the first film of the renaissance to receive mixed reviews from critics. It was still popular with audiences and commercially successful, earning $346 million worldwide. The film won two Academy Awards for its music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.

The next film, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996) was partially produced at the Paris studio. Although it is considered Disney&#x27;s darkest film, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; performed better critically than &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and grossed $325 million worldwide.

The following summer, &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997) did well at the box office, grossing $252 million worldwide, but underperformed in comparison to Disney&#x27;s previous films. It received positive reviews for its acting but the animation and music were mixed. &quot;Hercules&quot; was responsible for beginning the decline of traditionally-animated films. The declining box office success became doubly concerning inside the studio as wage competition from DreamWorks had significantly increased the studio&#x27;s overhead, with production costs increasing from $79 million in total costs (production, marketing, and overhead) for &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 1994 to $179 million for &quot;Hercules&quot; three years later. Moreover, Disney depended upon the popularity of its new features in order to develop merchandising, theme park attractions, direct-to-video sequels and television programming in its other divisions. The production schedule was scaled back and a larger number of creative executives were hired to more closely supervise production, a move that was not popular among the animation staff.

&quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), the first film produced primarily at the Florida studio, opened to positive reviews from audiences and critics and earned a successful $305 million at the worldwide box office, restoring both the critical and commercial success of the studio. The next film, &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck, had a high production cost of $130 million, again received positive reviews and earned $448 million at the box office. The &quot;Tarzan&quot; soundtrack by pop star Phil Collins resulted in significant record sales and an Academy Award for Best Song.

===1999–2005: Experimentation &amp; corporate disorder===
&quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, a sequel to the 1940 film that had been a pet project of Roy E. Disney&#x27;s since 1990, premiered on December 17, 1999, at Carnegie Hall in New York City as part of a concert tour that also visited London, Paris, Tokyo and Pasadena, California. The film was then released in 75 IMAX theaters worldwide from January 1 to April 30, 2000, making it the first animated feature-length film to be released in the format; a standard theatrical release followed on June 15, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. The film&#x27;s $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. It was in 2003 also that the Walt Disney company released &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; which went on to spawn a billion dollar franchise.

Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 to become president of The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider&#x27;s vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators&#x27; incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally-animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio&#x27;s staff – which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999 – down to approximately 1,200 employees.

In October 1999, Dream Quest Images, a special effects studio previously purchased by the Walt Disney Company in April 1996 to replace Buena Vista Visual Effects, was merged with the computer-graphics operation of Walt Disney Feature Animation to form a division called The Secret Lab. The Secret Lab produced one feature film, &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, which was released in May 2000 and featured CGI prehistoric creatures against filmed live-action backgrounds. The $128 million production earned $349 million worldwide, below studio expectations, and The Secret Lab was closed in 2001.

In December 2000, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; was released. It had been a musical epic called &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot; before being revised mid-production into a smaller comedy. The film earned $169 million worldwide on release, though it was well-reviewed and performed better on video; &quot;&quot; (2001), an attempt to break the Disney formula by moving into action-adventure, received mixed reviews and earned $186 million worldwide against production costs of $120 million.

By 2001 and early 2002, the notable successes of Pixar&#x27;s computer-animated films (thanks to its distribution deal with Disney), along with DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Shrek&quot; and Blue Sky Studios&#x27; &quot;Ice Age&quot;, respectively, against Disney&#x27;s lesser returns for &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and &quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire&quot; led to the speculation that hand-drawn animation was becoming obsolete. Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer-animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low not seen since the start of the studio&#x27;s ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.

The Burbank studio&#x27;s remaining hand-drawn productions, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, continued production. &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, a futuristic outer space retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, was a pet project of writer-directors Ron Clements and John Musker. It received an IMAX release and generally positive reviews but was financially unsuccessful upon its November 2002 release, resulting in a $74 million write-down for the Walt Disney Company in fiscal year 2003.

The Burbank studio&#x27;s 2D departments closed at the end of 2002, following the completion of &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, a long-in-production feature that had previously been known as &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;. Meanwhile, hand-drawn feature animation production continued at the Feature Animation Florida studio, where the films could be produced at lower costs. &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, an offbeat comedy-drama written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, became the studio&#x27;s first bonafide hit since &quot;Tarzan&quot; upon its summer 2002 release, earning $273 million worldwide against an $80 million production budget.

By this time, most of the Disney features from the 1990s had been spun off into direct-to-video sequels, television series, or both, produced by the Disney Television Animation unit. Beginning with the February 2002 release of &quot;Return to Never Land&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), Disney began releasing lower-budgeted sequels to earlier films. These films had been intended for video premieres, but they were released in theaters. The process was derided by some of the Disney animation staff and the fans of the Disney films.

In 2003, Tom Schumacher was appointed president of Buena Vista Theatrical Group, Disney&#x27;s stageplay and musical theater arm, and David Stainton, then president of Walt Disney Television Animation, was appointed as his replacement. Stainton continued to oversee Disney&#x27;s direct-to-video division, Disneytoon Studios, which had been part of the television animation department, though transferred at this time to Walt Disney Feature Animation management.

Under Stainton, the Florida studio completed &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, which did not perform as well as &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; critically or financially. Disney closed the Florida studio on January 12, 2004, with the then in-progress feature &quot;My Peoples&quot; left unfinished when the studio closed two months later. &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, released in April 2004, was also not as critically or commercially successful as &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. Disney officially announced its conversion of Walt Disney Feature Animation into a fully CGI studio – a process begun two years prior – now with a staff of 600 people. Disney also began selling off all of its traditional animation equipment.

Just after &quot;Brother Bear&quot;″s November 2003 release, Feature Animation chairman Roy E. Disney had resigned from the Walt Disney Company. Roy Disney and his business partner Stanley Gold launched a second external &quot;SaveDisney&quot; campaign, similar to the one that had forced Ron Miller out in 1984. This time they were attempting to force out Michael Eisner. Two of their arguing points against Eisner included his handling of Feature Animation and the souring of the studio&#x27;s relationship with Pixar. The same year, the studio collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering on the 4D theme park film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic&quot;. One of the studio&#x27;s first attempts at CG animation, the studio brought back several animators from the Renaissance period to work on the film; each animator worked on a sequence that they had previously worked on, such as Glen Keane animating Ariel for the &quot;Part of Your World&quot; sequence.

Talks between Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs over renewal terms for the highly lucrative Pixar-Disney distribution deal broke down in January 2004. Jobs, in particular, disagreed with Eisner&#x27;s insistence that sequels such as the then in-development &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) would not count against the number of films required in the studio&#x27;s new deal. To that end, Disney announced the launching of Circle 7 Animation, a division of Feature Animation which would have produced sequels to the Pixar films, while Pixar began shopping for a new distribution deal.

In 2005, Disney released its first fully computer-animated feature, &quot;Chicken Little&quot;. The film was a success at the box office, earning $315 million worldwide, but was met with critically mixed-to-negative reviews. Earlier that year, after two years of Roy E. Disney&#x27;s &quot;SaveDisney&quot; campaign, Eisner announced that he would resign and named Bob Iger, then president of the Walt Disney Company, his successor as chairman and CEO.

===2005–2010: Reorganization===

Iger later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t yet have a complete sense of just how broken Disney Animation was.&quot; He described its history since the early 1990s as &quot;dotted by a slew of expensive failures&quot; like &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Chicken Little&quot;; the &quot;modest successes&quot; like &quot;Mulan&quot; and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; were still critically and commercially unsuccessful compared to the earlier films of the Disney Renaissance.

After Iger became CEO, Jobs resumed negotiations for Pixar with Disney. On January 24, 2006, Disney announced that it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal, with the deal closing that May. Consequently, the Circle 7 studio launched to produce &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; was shut down. Most of that studio&#x27;s employees returned to Feature Animation and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; returned to Pixar&#x27;s control. Iger later said that it was &quot;a deal I wanted badly, and [Disney] needed badly.&quot; He believed that Disney Animation needed new leadership and, as part of the acquisition, Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter were named president and Chief Creative Officer, respectively, of Feature Animation as well as Pixar.

While Disney executives had discussed closing Feature Animation as redundant, Catmull and Lasseter refused and instead resolved to try to turn things around at the studio. Lasseter said, &quot;We weren&#x27;t going to let that [closure] happen on our watch. We were determined to save the legacy of Walt Disney&#x27;s amazing studio and bring it back up to the creative level it had to be. Saving this heritage was squarely on our shoulders.&quot; Lasseter and Catmull set about rebuilding the morale of the Feature Animation staff, and rehired a number of its 1980s &quot;new guard&quot; generation of star animators who had left the studio, including Ron Clements, John Musker, Eric Goldberg, Mark Henn, Andreas Deja, Bruce W. Smith and Chris Buck.

To maintain the separation of Walt Disney Feature Animation and Pixar despite their now common ownership and management, Catmull and Lasseter &quot;drew a hard line&quot; that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. Catmull said that he and Lasseter would &quot;make sure the studios are quite distinct from each other. We don&#x27;t want them to merge; that would definitely be the wrong approach. Each should have its own personality.&quot;

Catmull and Lasseter also brought to Disney Feature Animation the Pixar model of a &quot;filmmaker-driven studio&quot; as opposed to an &quot;executive-driven studio&quot;; they abolished Disney&#x27;s prior system of requiring directors to respond to &quot;mandatory&quot; notes from development executives ranking above the producers in favor of a system roughly analogous to peer review, in which non-mandatory notes come primarily from fellow producers, directors and writers. Most of the layers of &quot;gatekeepers&quot; (midlevel executives) were stripped away, and Lasseter established a routine of personally meeting weekly with filmmakers on all projects in the last year of production and delivering feedback on the spot.

The studio&#x27;s then-current team of top creatives who worked together closely on the development of its films became known as the Disney Story Trust. It was somewhat similar to the Pixar Braintrust, but its meetings were reportedly &quot;more polite&quot; than those of its Pixar counterpart.

In 2007, Lasseter changed the name of Walt Disney Feature Animation to Walt Disney Animation Studios, and re-positioned the studio as an animation house that produced both traditional and computer-animated projects. In order to keep costs down on hand-drawn productions, animation, design and layout were done in-house at Disney while clean-up animation and digital ink-and-paint were farmed out to vendors and freelancers.

The studio released &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot; in 2007, its second all-CGI film, earning $169.3 million worldwide. That same year, Disneytoon Studios was also restructured and began to operate as a separate unit under Lasseter and Catmull&#x27;s control. Lasseter&#x27;s direct intervention with the studio&#x27;s next film, &quot;American Dog&quot;, resulted in the departure of director Chris Sanders, who went on to become a director at DreamWorks Animation. The film was retooled by new directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams as &quot;Bolt&quot;. It was released in 2008 and had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. The film also became a moderate financial success, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Film.

&quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; was the studio&#x27;s first hand-drawn animated film in five years. It was loosely based on the fairy tale &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; and the 2002 novel &quot;The Frog Princess&quot;. The film was directed by Ron Clements and John Musker. A return to the musical-comedy format of the 1990s with songs by Randy Newman, the film was released in 2009 to a positive critical reception. It was also nominated for three Academy Awards, including two for Best Song.

The box office performance of &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; – a total of $267 million earned worldwide against a $105 million production budget – was seen as an underperformance due to competition with &quot;Avatar&quot;. The film&#x27;s underperformance was also attributed to the word &quot;Princess&quot; in the title. The future Disney films then in production which were about princesses were given gender-neutral, symbolic titles: &quot;Rapunzel&quot; became &quot;Tangled&quot; and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; became &quot;Frozen&quot;. In 2014, former Disney animator Tom Sito compared the box office performance of &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; to that of &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), which was a step-up from the theatrical run of the 1985 film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;.

In 2009, the studio also produced the computer-animated &quot;Prep &amp; Landing&quot; holiday special for the ABC television network.

===2010–2019: New leadership and return to success===
After &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, the studio released &quot;Tangled&quot;, a musical CGI adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;Rapunzel&quot; with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. In active development since 2002 under Glen Keane, &quot;Tangled&quot;, directed by Byron Howard and Nathan Greno, was released in 2010 and became a significant critical and commercial success and was nominated for several accolades. The film earned $592 million in worldwide box office revenue, becoming the studio&#x27;s third most successful release to date.

The hand-drawn feature &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, a new feature film based on the eponymous stories by A. A. Milne, followed in 2011 to positive reviews; it remains the studio&#x27;s most recent hand-drawn feature. The film was released in theaters alongside the hand-drawn short &quot;The Ballad of Nessie&quot;.

&quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, directed by Rich Moore, was released in 2012 to critical acclaim and commercial success. A comedy-adventure about a video-game villain who redeems himself as a hero, it won numerous awards, including the Annie, Critics&#x27; Choice and Kids&#x27; Choice Awards for Best Animated Feature Film, and received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. The film earned $471 million in worldwide box office revenue.

In addition, the studio won its first Academy Award for a short film in forty-four years with &quot;Paperman&quot;, which was released in theaters with &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;. Directed by John Kahrs, &quot;Paperman&quot; utilized new software developed in-house at the studio called Meander, which merges hand-drawn and computer animation techniques within the same character to create a unique &quot;hybrid&quot;. According to Producer Kristina Reed, the studio was at the time continuing to develop the technique for future projects, including an animated feature.

In 2013, the studio laid off nine of its hand-drawn animators, including Nik Ranieri and Ruben A. Aquino, leading to speculation on animation blogs that the studio was abandoning traditional animation, an idea that the studio dismissed. Later that same year, in November, &quot;Frozen&quot;, a CGI musical film inspired by Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, was released to widespread acclaim and became a blockbuster hit. Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee with songs by the Broadway team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, it was the first Disney animated film to earn over $1 billion in worldwide box office revenue. &quot;Frozen&quot; also became the first film from Walt Disney Animation Studios to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (a category started in 2001), as well as the first feature-length motion picture from the studio to win an Academy Award since &quot;Tarzan&quot; and the first to win multiple Academy Awards since &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. It was released in theaters with &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;, a new &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoon combining black-and-white hand-drawn animation and full-color CGI animation.

The studio&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, a CGI comedy-adventure film inspired by the Marvel Comics series of the same name, was released in November 2014. For the film, the studio developed new light rendering software called Hyperion, which the studio continued to use on all subsequent films. &quot;Big Hero 6&quot; received critical acclaim and was the highest-grossing animated film of 2014, also winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The film was accompanied in theaters by the animated short &quot;Feast&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. In the same month that &quot;Big Hero 6&quot; was released, it was announced that General Manager, Andrew Millstein had been promoted as President of Walt Disney Animation Studios.

In March 2016, the studio released &quot;Zootopia&quot;, a CGI buddy-comedy film set in a modern world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $1 billion worldwide, and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

&quot;Moana&quot;, a CGI fantasy-adventure film, was released in November 2016. The film was shown in theaters with the animated short, &quot;Inner Workings&quot;. &quot;Moana&quot; was another commercial and critical success for the studio, grossing over $600 million worldwide and receiving two Academy Award nominations.

In November 2017, John Lasseter announced that he was taking a six-month leave of absence after acknowledging what he called &quot;missteps&quot; in his behavior with employees in a memo to staff. According to various news outlets, Lasseter had a history of alleged sexual misconduct towards employees. On June 8, 2018, it was announced that Lasseter would leave Disney and Pixar at the end of the year after the company decided not to renew his contract. He would instead take on a consulting role until the expiration of the contract. Jennifer Lee was announced as Lasseter&#x27;s replacement as chief creative officer of Disney Animation on June 19, 2018.

On June 28, 2018, the studio&#x27;s division Disneytoon Studios was shut down, resulting in the layoffs of 75 animators and staff. On October 23, 2018, it was announced that Ed Catmull would be retiring at the end of the year, and would stay in an adviser role until July 2019.

In November 2018, the studio released a sequel to &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, titled &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. The film grossed over $529 million worldwide and received nominations for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award, both for Best Animated Feature.

===2019–present: Ongoing changes &amp; struggles===
In August 2019, it was announced that Andrew Millstein would be stepping down from his role as president, before moving on to become co-president of Blue Sky Studios alongside Robert Baird, while Clark Spencer was named president of Disney Animation, reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Bergman and working alongside chief creative officer Jennifer Lee.

&quot;Frozen 2&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Frozen&quot;, was released in November 2019. The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.

From 2020 to 2022, Disney Animation produced a series of experimental shorts called &quot;Short Circuit&quot; for the Disney+ streaming service. The first pack of shorts was released in January 2020, and a second pack was released in August 2021. During that period, Disney Animation returned to work on hand-drawn animation once again, having released the hand-drawn &quot;At Home with Olaf&quot; web short &quot;Ice,&quot; as well as three hand-drawn animated Goofy shorts for Disney+, and a hand-drawn animated &quot;Short Circuit&quot; titled &quot;Dinosaur Barbarian&quot;. In April 2022, Eric Goldberg confirmed plans within the studio to develop hand-drawn animated films and series. That year saw the release of the hand-drawn shorts &quot;Mickey in a Minute&quot;, released as part of the Disney+ documentary &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot;, which marked the title character&#x27;s first animated short produced by Disney Animation since Disney acquired the rights for the character in 2006.

In December 2020, the studio announced that it was expanding into producing television series – a business usually handled by the Disney Television Animation division. Most of the projects in development are for Disney+. The CG series produced include &quot;Baymax!&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;), &quot;Zootopia+&quot; (an anthology series set in the &quot;Zootopia&quot; universe), and &quot;Iwájú&quot; (an original long-form science fiction anthology series co-produced with British-based Pan-African entertainment company Kugali Media). In addition, employees from Disney Animation are involved on the Disney Television Animation series &quot;Monsters at Work&quot;, based on Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; franchise.

&quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;, a CGI fantasy-adventure film, was released in March 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. The film was accompanied in theaters with the animated short &quot;Us Again&quot;. &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot; grossed over $130 million at the box office and became a hit on the streaming charts after its Premier Access charge expired on Disney+. The film became the third most streamed film title of 2021. The film also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

In August 2021, it was reported that Disney Animation was opening a new animation studio in Vancouver. Operations at the Vancouver studio started in 2022, with former Disney Animation finance lead Amir Nasrabadi serving as head for the studio. The Vancouver studio works on the animation for the Disney+-exclusive long-form series and future Disney+ specials, while the short-form series are animated at the Burbank studio. Pre-production and storyboarding for the long-form series and specials also take place at the Burbank studio.

In November 2021, the studio released &quot;Encanto&quot;, a CGI musical-fantasy film. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was given an exclusive 30-day theatrical run in theaters and was released to Disney+ on December 24, 2021. It was released in theaters with the 2D/CG hybrid short &quot;Far from the Tree&quot;. Although &quot;Encanto&quot; was not able to break-even at the box office by grossing $256 million against its $120–150 million budget, it went viral over the 2021 holiday season and achieved wider commercial success after its digital release to Disney+. The film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score and Best Original Song.

In November 2022, the studio released the CGI action-adventure film &quot;Strange World&quot;. Although the film received positive reviews, it was a box-office failure, grossing $73 million worldwide on a budget of $135–180 million, with an estimated loss of $100–147 million.

By 2023, the studio had opened a new apprentice program for hand-drawn animators. That same year, the live-action/animated short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; was released to celebrate Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary, which occurred in October 2023.

The 2D/CG hybrid musical-fantasy film &quot;Wish&quot; was released in November 2023. The film&#x27;s theme is inspired by Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed roughly $255 million worldwide against a production budget of $175–200 million, resulting in a loss of an estimated $131 million. The film was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film.

In September 2024, Lee announced that she was stepping down from her position as Disney Animation&#x27;s chief creative officer to return to full-time filmmaking at the studio—specifically, to direct and write &quot;Frozen 3&quot; and also to write and executive produce &quot;Frozen 4&quot;. Jared Bush was named as her successor.

The studio released the sequel &quot;Moana 2&quot; in November 2024. The project was originally under development as a series for Disney+ before being reworked into a theatrical feature film. The film received mixed reviews and was a commercial success, grossing over $1 billion worldwide.

==Production logo==
Until 2007, Walt Disney Animation Studios did not use a traditional production logo, using the standard Walt Disney Pictures logo instead. Starting with 2007 film &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;, an on-screen production logo based on &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was added. The logo has had variants, such as pixilation for the 2012 film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;.

&quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; entered the public domain on January 1, 2024, as it was published in 1928. The logo remains in use.

===Locations===

Since 1995, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been headquartered in the Roy E. Disney Animation Building in Burbank, California, across Riverside Drive from the Walt Disney Studios, where the original Animation building (now housing corporate offices) is located. The Disney Animation Building&#x27;s lobby is capped by a large version of the famous hat from the &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; segment of &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), and the building is informally called the &quot;hat building&quot; for that reason.

Until the mid-1990s, Disney Animation previously operated out of the Air Way complex, a cluster of old hangars, office buildings, and trailers in the Grand Central Business Centre, an industrial park on the site of the former Grand Central Airport about two miles (3.2 km) east in the city of Glendale. The Disneytoon Studios unit was based in Glendale. Disney Animation&#x27;s archive, formerly known as &quot;the morgue&quot; (based on an analogy to a morgue file) and today known as the Animation Research Library, is also located in Glendale. Unlike the Burbank buildings, the ARL is located in a nondescript office building near Disney&#x27;s Grand Central Creative Campus. The 12,000-square-foot ARL is home to over 64 million items of animation artwork dating back to 1924; because of its importance to the company, visitors are required to agree not to disclose its exact location within Glendale.

Previously, feature animation satellite studios were located around the world in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France (a suburb of Paris), and in Bay Lake, Florida (near Orlando, at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park). The Paris studio was shut down in 2002, while the Florida studio was shut down in 2004. The Florida animation building survives as an office building, while the former Magic of Disney Animation section of the building is home to &quot;Star Wars&quot; Launch Bay.

In the wake of Roy E. Disney&#x27;s death in 2009, the Burbank headquarters were re-dedicated the Roy E. Disney Animation Building in May 2010.

In November 2014, Disney Animation commenced a 16-month upgrade of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, in order to fix what then-studio president Edwin Catmull had called its &quot;dungeon-like&quot; interior. For example, the interior was so cramped that it could not easily accommodate &quot;town hall&quot; meetings with all employees in attendance. Due to the renovation, the studio&#x27;s employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space – the Disneytoon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building). The renovation was completed in October 2016.

===Feature films===
Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced animated features in a series of animation techniques, including traditional animation, computer animation, combination of both and animation combined with live-action scenes. The studio&#x27;s first film, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, was released on December 21, 1937, and their most recent film, &quot;Moana 2&quot;, was released on November 27, 2024.

Starting with &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005), most of their films have cost between $150–175 million. &quot;Tangled&quot; (2010) is the studio&#x27;s most expensive film, with a budget of $260 million.

===Short films===
Since &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced a series of prominent short films, including the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoons and the &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; series, until the cartoon studio division was closed in 1956. Many of these shorts provided a medium for the studio to experiment with new technologies that they would use in their filmmaking process, such as the synchronization of sound in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928), the integration of the three-strip Technicolor process in &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; (1932), the multiplane camera in &quot;The Old Mill&quot; (1937), the xerography process in &quot;Goliath II&quot; (1960), and the hand-drawn/CGI hybrid animation in &quot;Off His Rockers&quot; (1992), &quot;Paperman&quot; (2012), &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; (2013). and &quot;Feast&quot; (2014).

===Television programming===
Walt Disney Animation Studios announced its expansion into television programming in 2020 and is currently producing original shows for Disney+, including &quot;Tiana&quot; (TBA).

<doc id="1303945" wikidata="Q5503504" url="?curid=1303945" title="Friday Night! with Ralph Benmergui">
<text>Friday Night! with Ralph Benmergui was a Canadian television variety show, which aired on CBC Television from 1992 to 1993. The show initially aired at 10 p.m., following &quot;Prime Time News&quot;, but was moved to 11 p.m. in January 1993 and aired in the later time slot for the remainder of its run.

The show debuted October 30, 1992, and was hosted by Ralph Benmergui, formerly of &quot;Midday&quot;. The house band, called simply &quot;The House&quot; and including musicians such as Matt Zimbel, Doug Wilde and Taborah Johnson, provided the music in the first season; they were replaced in the second season by Look People, led by Jaymz Bee. It was one hour long and had an American late-night talk show format: an opening monologue by Benmergui followed by comedy sketches, guest interviews, and musical performances.

The show&#x27;s primary goal was to highlight and promote emerging Canadian talent, although established celebrities also sometimes appeared. Notable guests on the show included Céline Dion, Leonard Cohen, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Barenaked Ladies and Don Cherry. Future late-night host Mike Bullard had a regular spot delivering two-minute rants during the show&#x27;s second season.

Although the show received strong ratings at first, with almost a million viewers for its premiere, it soon declined to less than half of its initial audience, representing only one-third of the audience that the CBC had in its timeslot the previous year. The critics were not impressed, either; one segment featured real TV scribes reviewing the program, mostly unfavourably, while it was still in progress.

The first season aired its final episode on April 2, 1993, and was then followed by two &quot;best of&quot; specials featuring musical performances from prior episodes. During the off-season, the show responded to its critical and audience reception by overhauling its production team; production was ultimately taken over by comedian and Yuk Yuk&#x27;s founder Mark Breslin. Benmergui also refreshed his own personal style, adopting a hipper, more casual look instead of the loud patterned or shiny suits he had favoured in the first season, and the original house band were dropped and replaced by The Look People. The show also dropped Benmergui&#x27;s opening monologue, instead using the opening slot to highlight a different stand-up comedian each week, and changed its format so that the show would centre on one feature interview each episode.

The second season premiered in October 1993, but Breslin&#x27;s changes failed to improve the program&#x27;s critical reception or ratings. The final episode of &quot;Friday Night!&quot; aired on December 31, 1993, and the program&#x27;s cancellation was announced in the first week of January 1994.

Benmergui subsequently moved to CBC Newsworld, hosting the afternoon talk show &quot;Benmergui Live&quot;. The CBC subsequently developed another variety series, &quot;Rita and Friends&quot;, which began airing in the fall of 1994.

<text>A finger pillory is a style of restraint where the fingers are held in a wooden block, using an L-shaped hole to keep the knuckle bent inside the block. The name is taken from the pillory, a much larger device used to secure the head and hands.

Finger stocks were also used in churches for minor offences, like not paying attention during a sermon. An example still survives in St Helen&#x27;s Church, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England.

<text>Trekkies 2 is a 2004 American documentary film directed by Roger Nygard, and the sequel to the 1997 film &quot;Trekkies&quot;. The film travels throughout the world, mainly Europe, to show fans of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, commonly known as Trekkies. It also profiles people from the first film, including Barbara Adams and Gabriel Köerner. Also featured are &quot;Star Trek&quot;-themed punk bands from Sacramento, California, including Warp 11 and the &quot;No Kill I&quot; franchise.

==Production==
One of the European filming shots were done in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro (modern day Serbia).

== Reception ==
MaryAnn Johanson of &quot;Flick Filosopher&quot; wrote &quot;this time out the focus is on the real people behind the Spock ears, and the film recognizes that they’re a lot more clever, creative, self-aware, and generous than the uninitiated will have realized.&quot;

Nick Schager of &quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot; gave it D+ grade. He called it &quot;a repetitive hodgepodge&quot; and &quot;More sloppily constructed than the first film&quot;.

<text>Benjamin Stewart Parsons (July 12, 1941 – January 16, 2007) was an American NASCAR driver, and later an announcer/analyst/pit reporter on SETN, TBS, ABC, ESPN, NBC, and TNT. He became famous as the 1973 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion, and was a 2017 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductee. He was the older brother of former NASCAR driver, car owner, and broadcaster Phil Parsons of Phil Parsons Racing.

He was nicknamed &quot;BP&quot; and &quot;the Professor&quot;, the latter in part because of his popular remarks and relaxed demeanor.

==Early life==
Parsons was born in Wilkes County, North Carolina. He spent his childhood years in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and played football at Millers Creek High School (now known as West Wilkes High School). Following high school, he moved to Detroit, Michigan where his father operated a taxicab company. Parsons worked at a gas station and drove cabs in Detroit before beginning his racing career. While working at the gas station one day, a couple of customers towing a race car invited him to a local race track. The driver of the car never showed up for that evening&#x27;s race, and Parsons drove the car in a race for the first time later that night. Benny later moved to Ellerbe, North Carolina and always called it home.

==Driving career==

===1960s===
Parsons began his NASCAR career by running a single race in 1964 for Holman-Moody with a young Cale Yarborough.

Parsons won the 1968 and 1969 ARCA championships, and then moved to Ellerbe, North Carolina.

Parsons had three top-10 finishes in four NASCAR races in 1969.

===1970s===
Benny joined the NASCAR circuit full-time in 1970 with crew chief John Hill. He had 23 top-10 finishes in 45 races, a pole at Langley Field Speedway, and finished eighth in the final point standings. He raced the No. 72 car for L.G. DeWitt/DeWitt Racing.

Parsons had 18 top-10 finishes in 35 starts in 1971, including his first win at South Boston Speedway. He finished eleventh in the points.

In 1972, he had 19 top-10 finishes in 31 races. He finished fifth in the final points standings.

In 1973, he won the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Championship with only one win, even though David Pearson won eleven races, although Pearson had only entered eighteen events. Parsons&#x27; consistency likely won him the championship: he had 21 top-10 and 15 top-5 finishes in the 28 events.

His improbable return to the track after an early crash cemented his 1973 championship at Rockingham, North Carolina. He saw his championship hopes start to fade as he was involved in a lap 13 crash and his car was heavily damaged. He took to the pits to muster whatever he could out of the car and hope for a top five finish in the final standings. The rest of the garage was hoping to see the underdog unseat the mighty Richard Petty and joined in to help Parsons&#x27; crew put the car back together. Parsons miraculously got back on the track 136 laps later and completed enough laps to finish 25th and take the 1973 championship. Richard Petty, with the championship in his sights after winning the pole and seeing Parsons&#x27; accident, had engine trouble and was relegated to a 35th-place finish. The poor performance dropped Petty all the way to fifth in the final standings, as Cale Yarborough took the runner up spot on the season with his third-place effort. Yarborough finished 67 points behind the champion.

Parsons became the only person to win both ARCA and NASCAR championships.

Parsons finished between third and fifth in the final points standings from 1974 to 1980, and won the 1975 Daytona 500. He switched to the No. 27 entry for M.C. Anderson starting in 1979.

In 1979 at North Wilkesboro Speedway, Bobby Allison led most of the race, but in the final 150 laps, Darrell Waltrip caught Allison. The two hit together hard and Waltrip hit the front stretch wall. Waltrip began crowding Allison under the caution and got black flagged for the crowding. Benny Parsons would win the race, but it would be his only win at the North Wilkesboro Speedway. Parsons&#x27; wife Terri, with whom he was married from 1992 until his death in 2007, became an investor in North Wilkesboro Speedway two years after his death.

===1980s===

He won the 1980 World 600 at Charlotte and the Los Angeles Times 500 (the final major motor race held at Ontario Motor Speedway) and finished 3rd in points.

In 1981, he started racing in the No. 15 Bud Moore Ford Thunderbird. He had wins at Nashville Speedway USA, the final race at Texas World Speedway, and Richmond. In addition, he received his final top-ten points finish, finishing tenth that year.

Parsons qualified for the 1982 Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway at 200.175 miles per hour (mph), which was the first NASCAR qualification run over .
Parsons raced in about half of the races between 1983 and 1986 for owner Johnny Hayes. Parsons&#x27; final career victory came in 1984 at the Coca-Cola 500 at Atlanta.

He appeared in the 1983 Burt Reynolds movie &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;.

Parsons joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1987 as a substitute driver for Tim Richmond, who was stricken with AIDS. During the first lap of a race at Darlington Raceway, Parsons hit the wall and badly damaged his race car. He was able to continue, but had to make several pit stops for repairs. At one point, his crew chief, Harry Hyde, refused to allow Parsons to pit because he and the crew were on an ice cream break. This incident was alluded to in the film, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;. Another scene in the film was inspired by a real-life incident at Martinsville Speedway involving Parsons and the notoriously cantankerous Hyde. Hyde sarcastically told Parsons to hit the pace car on a restart because it was the only thing on the track that Parsons had not hit.

Parsons drove the No. 90 Bulls Eye BBQ Ford for Junie Donlavey in his final NASCAR season in 1988 and then moved to the broadcast booth, a position that he would hold until his death.

Parsons did decide to race a few other times. The first was during the 2003 Old Dominion 500 as part of an advertising segment for &quot;Wally&#x27;s World.&quot; He then drove a ceremonial victory lap at the last fall race at Rockingham in 2003 in a 1973 Chevrolet similar to the one in which he had won a championship.

Parsons is also credited with discovering former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle at a &quot;Gong Show&quot; held in Tucson, Arizona.

After permanently retiring from racing in 1988, Parsons became a broadcaster – first on ESPN, and then with NBC and TNT in 2001. He received an ESPN Emmy in 1996, and the ACE Award in 1989. He appears in the videogames &quot;NASCAR &#x27;99&quot;, &quot;NASCAR 2000&quot;, and &quot;NASCAR 2001&quot; as a commentator as well as an unlockable legend (he was only featured in &quot;NASCAR 2001&quot; as an announcer). He later appeared in &quot;NASCAR Rumble&quot; as a legend in the game as well as &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2002&quot;, &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2003&quot;, and &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2004&quot; as an unlockable driver and featured the game in NBC and TNT telecasts where Parsons did EA Sports Thunder Motion where he took viewers on a virtual ride of each track.

Parsons co-hosted coverage of Winston Cup Qualifying on North Carolina radio station WFMX with Mark Garrow in the early &#x27;90s. He continued to co-host a radio program called &quot;Fast Talk&quot; on Performance Racing Network (PRN) with Doug Rice until his death (he was replaced by an alternating host). He also had a podcast available on iTunes, in conjunction with CNN called &quot; The CNN Radio Racing Report with Benny Parsons&quot;. 

Parsons appeared as himself in the 1995 children&#x27;s video &quot;NASCAR For Kids - A Day At The Races,” acting as the host.

In 2005, Parsons made a cameo appearance as himself in the movie &quot;&quot;. In 2006, he again appeared as himself in &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;.

==Personal life==
Parsons married twice, with his first wife Connie they had two sons Kevin and Keith and married till Connie&#x27;s death in June 1991. Parsons married Terri but they would not have kids together.

==Illness and death==
Parsons began having trouble breathing in the summer of 2006. He was diagnosed with lung cancer. He announced in October 2006 that the treatment had been successful, and that he had a clean bill of health. Parsons had stopped smoking in 1978, the treatment cost Parsons the use of his left lung.

His health prevented him from attending a ceremony in November 2006 where he was to be presented with the Myers Brothers Award, honoring his contributions to racing.

On December 26, 2006, Parsons was readmitted to the hospital and placed in intensive care because of complications relating to lung cancer. Doctors would find a blood clot in his right lung.

On January 16, 2007, Parsons died of complications from lung cancer treatment in the intensive care unit of the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is buried near his childhood home in Purlear, North Carolina, which is now the site of Benny Parsons&#x27; Rendezvous Ridge. Rendezvous Ridge is also his wife Terri&#x27;s residence as well as being a racing museum and a winery.

<text>Walter Kwok Ping-sheung (; ; 1950 – 20 October 2018) was a Hong Kong real estate developer. He was the eldest son of Kwok Tak-seng, founder of Sun Hung Kai Properties, and his wife Kwong Siu-hing. Following their father&#x27;s death in 1990, he and his brothers Thomas and Raymond inherited Sun Hung Kai Properties.

Kwok, formerly chairman and CEO of Sun Hung Kai Properties, negotiated his departure from the family firm in 2010. His mother remains the controlling shareholder of the company, whilst his brothers manage the firm. The Kwok family was ranked third in 2017 &quot;Asia&#x27;s Richest Families&quot;, with an estimated net worth of US$40.4 billion as of November 2017.

==Early life and family==
Kwok was born in 1950 in British Hong Kong, the eldest son of Kwok Tak-seng, founder of Sun Hung Kai Properties, and his wife Kwong Siu-hing. The Kwok family&#x27;s ancestral home was located in Zhongshan, Guangdong, formerly known as Xiangshan. Kwok was educated at Imperial College London in England, from which he earned a master&#x27;s degree in civil engineering.

Kwok and his younger brothers Thomas and Raymond are together referred to by media as the Kwok brothers. Together they controlled the majority of Sun Hung Kai Properties (until ouster in 2008, see below section). As of March 2018, all three brothers were listed in the Forbes 2018 &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot;, with a net worth of US$16.5 billion (Thomas and Raymond) and US$8 billion (Walter only) respectively. In a separate listing, the Kwok family was listed as the third-richest in Forbes&#x27;s &quot;2017 Asia&#x27;s Richest Families&quot;, with a net worth of US$40.4 billion as of November 2017. The net worth by Forbes as of his death was US$6.9 billion.

==Abduction==
Kwok was kidnapped by the notorious gangster &quot;Big Spender&quot; Cheung Tze-keung on 30 September 1997, and was released seven days later without police intervention. Negotiations fronted by wife Wendy resulted in payment of a ransom rumoured to have been nine figures. Following his arrest in Guangzhou in 1998, Cheung confessed that he had put Kwok in a wooden container blindfolded for four days, and fed him regular meals of roast pork with rice, until the ransom of some HK$600 million was paid. The ransom in 1,000-dollar notes was packed inside 20 large carrier bags and driven in two Mercedes saloon cars to a quiet lane in Central district. After the kidnapping, the badly shaken Kwok handed over the executive duties of SHKP to his younger brothers while retaining the title of chairman and chief executive. His abductor, Cheung, was captured in Guangzhou, China, and executed in December 1998.

==Later chairmanship==
As a result of his kidnapping ordeal, Kwok reportedly developed deep psychological problems, and while he retained the titles of chairman and chief executive, his two brothers Thomas and Raymond controlled day-to-day operations of the group.

Under Kwok&#x27;s later chairmanship, press reported that a former girlfriend, Ida Tong, had become increasingly influential in decision making. This influence has led to business decisions by Kwok that departed from its previous conservative model, and without the consensus of his brothers.

==Ouster==
On 18 February 2008, Sun Hung Kai Properties issued a statement saying Kwok would take a temporary leave of absence for personal reasons with immediate effect. Kwok later issued a statement stating he would take a personal holiday to travel to the United States, Beijing and other cities in the coming two to three months, adding he would resume his duties on his return. However, Kwok was formally removed as the chairman on 27 May, with his mother Kwong Siu-hing taking over as chairperson. Kwok remained as one of the non-executive directors until his resignation in 2014.

The &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; and sister publication &quot;The Standard&quot; reported that the family matriarch Kwong Siu-hing, wielding the holding of the Sun Hung Kai trust, intervened to oust Kwok from his chairman position to protect the family&#x27;s interests. It was said that Tong&#x27;s influence as Kwok&#x27;s mistress of four years had caused friction with his brothers.

Kwok founded in 2010. Empire Group Holdings was incorporated in Hong Kong, and was notable for forming joint ventures with other real estate developers in the bidding of the leasehold of Government Land, such as the Hong Kong Ferry in August 2016 and Sino Land in October 2016. The group also acquired the rights to re-develop and operate the former site of the Mariners&#x27; Club in Tsim Sha Tsui, despite not owning the re-developed properties.

In 2012, Kwok&#x27;s younger brothers Thomas and Raymond, as well as Rafael Hui, previously the second-highest ranking government official in Hong Kong, were arrested by the city&#x27;s anti-corruption agency on suspicion of bribery. Thomas Kwok and Rafael Hui were sentenced to prison, while Raymond Kwok was acquitted. It is suggested that Walter Kwok, who was not arrested, provided information to the authorities in retaliation for his ousting from Sun Hung Kai Properties.

Kwok also sued his brothers to revoke the agreement on the distribution of the family fortune. According to his testimony in the court proceedings, he received some real estate in the United States, but of lesser value than what his brothers received.

==Personal life==
Kwok&#x27;s parents introduced him to Lydia Ku Chee-yung, the daughter of a wealthy businessman from Shanghai, whom he married on 15 September 1982, but the marriage broke up six months later.

Kwok married Wendy Lee Ting-wing in 1983. They had two sons, Geoffrey and Jonathan, and a daughter.

Kwok died at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital – Stubbs Road on 20 October 2018, two months after suffering a stroke. He was 68.

<text>František Křižík (; 8 July 1847 – 22 January 1941) was a Czech inventor, electrical engineer, and entrepreneur.

==Biography==

Křižík was born into a family in Plánice. In spite of his background, Křižík managed in 1866 to study engineering at the Technical University of Prague ČVUT.

Křižík is considered the pioneer of practical electrical engineering and in electrification of Bohemia and Austro-Hungarian empire. At the time he was often compared to Thomas Edison. In 1878 Křižík invented a remotely operated signaling device to protect against collision between trains. Křižík&#x27;s cores are magnetic
solenoids cores shaped so as to ensure an approximately uniform pull in different positions in the solenoid.

His first experiments in Plzeň resulted in the invention in 1880 of the automatic electric arc lamp, the so-called &quot;Plzen Lamp&quot; which was displayed at the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris in 1881. This lamp, with self-adjusting brushes, won the gold medal from among 50 similar devices. Later he successfully defended his patent against Werner Siemens claim to have created it first. His lamps were successfully used in many cities for street lighting. The restored and fully functional patented arc lamp with automated electrode adjustment can be viewed at the Museum of Plzeň.

In 1884 Křižík set up his own company building city lighting, tramway lines, street cars, power stations, and various electric equipment. In 1895 Křižík built one of first electromobiles in the Austrian Empire.

He was active freemason since 1881 when he joined masonic lodge &quot;Harmonie&quot; in Plzeň. He was later active as member of lodge &quot;Jan Amos Komenský&quot; and later lodge &quot;Sibi et posteris&quot; in Prague. In 1923 František Křižík was one of the founders nad patrons of the National Czechoslovak Grand Lodge.

A Prague street and subsequently near subway station were named after František Křižík – Křižíkova.

==Electrified railway Tábor–Bechyně==

František Křižík built the first electrified railway in the Austro-Hungarian empire from Tábor to Bechyně in 1903. The track gauge was . The maximum speed was .

==Legacy==
The main belt asteroid 5719 Křižík was named in his honor.

<doc id="1303981" wikidata="Q402633" url="?curid=1303981" title="Deprenyl">
<text>Deprenyl, also known by its developmental code name E-250 and as &quot;N&quot;-propargylmethamphetamine, is the racemic mixture of -deprenyl and -deprenyl (selegiline). It was discovered in 1961 in Hungary at Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company by Zoltan Ecseri and József Knoll, was patented in 1962, and was first described in the literature in 1964 or 1965.

The drug is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. It is a prodrug of methamphetamine and amphetamine, which mediates the latter action. Deprenyl was studied clinically at high doses of 50 to 100mg/day and was described as a psychostimulant and antidepressant. At lower doses, selective MAO-B inhibition would be expected, but at these higher doses, dual inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B would occur, on the basis of -deprenyl.

Subsequent to its synthesis, the stereoisomers of deprenyl were separated. The dextrorotatory isomer, -deprenyl, was found to be more toxic, producing effects like hyperthermia and more potent psychostimulation in rodents. The levorotatory isomer, selegiline, was much more potent as an MAO-B inhibitor, and was subsequently developed for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and depression.

Deprenyl is reported to result in side effects including agitation, anxiety, and sleep disturbances more often than selegiline.

Similarly to selegiline, deprenyl is a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE). Both enantiomers of deprenyl, -deprenyl and selegiline, are active in this respect, but selegiline is slightly more potent than -deprenyl.

<doc id="1303985" wikidata="Q5375325" url="?curid=1303985" title="Encaustic tile">
<text>Encaustic or inlaid tiles are ceramic tiles in which the pattern or figure on the surface is not a product of the glaze but of different colors of clay. They are usually of two colours but a tile may be composed of as many as six. The pattern appears inlaid into the body of the tile, so that the design remains as the tile is worn down. Encaustic tiles may be glazed or unglazed and the inlay may be as shallow as , as is often the case with &quot;printed&quot; encaustic tile from the later medieval period, or as deep as .

==History==

The tiles known as &#x27;encaustic tiles&#x27; in the Victorian period were, in the medieval period, known as &#x27;inlaid tiles&#x27;. The use of the word &quot;encaustic&quot; to describe an inlaid tile of two or more colors is linguistically incorrect. The word &quot;encaustic&quot;, from the , means &#x27;burning in&#x27;, from , and .

The term &quot;encaustic&quot; originally described a process of painting with a beeswax-based paint that was then fixed with heat. It was also applied to a process of medieval enameling. The term did not come into use when describing tile until the 19th century; supposedly, Victorians thought that the two colour tiles strongly resembled enamel work and so called them encaustic. Despite the error, the term has now been in common use for so long that it is an accepted name for inlaid tile work.

Encaustic or inlaid tiles enjoyed two periods of great popularity. The first came in the 13th century and lasted until the English Reformation under Henry VIII of England in the 16th century, which eschewed and removed much medieval church decoration along with the policy of the dissolution of the monasteries.

The second period of popularity came when the tiles caught the attention of craftsmen during the Gothic Revival era, who, after much trial and error, mass-produced encaustic tiles, and made them available to the general public. During both periods, tiles were made across Western Europe, though the centre of tile production was in England. Companies in the United States also made encaustic tile during the Gothic Revival architecture style&#x27;s period. The American Encaustic Tiling Company of Zanesville, Ohio, was active until 1935. However, in the 1930s, encaustic tiling began to lose ground to more affordable glass and vitreous glass tiles.

== Manufacture ==
Modern encaustic tiles use a two-shot moulding process. The &#x27;inlay&#x27; colour is moulded first. For multiple colours, a mould with cavities for each colour is used and the individual colours are filled carefully. This coloured clay is then placed face-down in a mould that is backfilled with the body colour. The tiles are then fired.

The manufacture of encaustic clay tiles may be seen today at the Jackfield Tile Museum, one of the Ironbridge Gorge museums.

==Use==
In both the Middle Ages and in the 19th and 20th century Gothic Revival, tiles were most often made for and laid in churches. Even tiles that were laid in private homes were often copies of those found in religious settings. Encaustic tile floors exist all over Europe and North America, but are most prevalent in England where the greatest numbers of inlaid tiles were made.

<text>The Princeton Branch, also known as the Dinky, or the Princeton Junction and Back (PJ&amp;B), is a commuter rail line and service owned and operated by New Jersey Transit (NJT) in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The line is a short branch of the Northeast Corridor Line, running from Princeton Junction northwest to Princeton with no intermediate stops (the line had an intermediate stop, Penns Neck, until 1971). The branch is served by special 1-or-2 car trains. Now running along a single track, it is the shortest scheduled commuter rail line in the United States. The run takes approximately 5 minutes in each direction.

At the initiative of Princeton University, the line was shortened by in order to construct a new University Arts Center. A new station opened on November 17, 2014.

Service on the Princeton Branch was temporarily suspended and replaced by shuttle buses from October 14, 2018, through May 11, 2019, as part of NJT&#x27;s systemwide service reductions during the installation and testing of positive train control.

==Service==
The Princeton Branch provides rail service directly to the Princeton University campus from Princeton Junction, where New Jersey Transit and Amtrak provide Northeast Corridor rail service, heading northeast to Newark, New York City, and Boston, and southwest to Trenton, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. As of 2016, the branch schedule includes 41 round trips each weekday. The line is served by a two-car set of GE Arrow III self-propelled electric coach cars.

===Service suspension 2018–19===
In September 2018, New Jersey Transit announced that it would be suspending all service on the Princeton Branch from mid-October 2018 until mid-January 2019, and providing shuttle bus service instead. Restoration of train service was later postponed until May 12, 2019. Systemwide service reductions were attributed to the installation and testing of positive train control, compounded by a shortage of train engineers. The automatic braking system will not be installed on the Princeton Branch itself.

==History==

===Operational milestones===
When the Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C&amp;A) opened its original Trenton–New Brunswick line in 1839, completing the first rail connection between Philadelphia and New York Harbor, the line was located along the east bank of the newly completed Delaware and Raritan Canal, about one mile (2 km) from downtown Princeton. A new alignment (now the Northeast Corridor Line) opened on November 23, 1863, but some passenger trains continued to use the old line until the Princeton Branch opened on May 29, 1865, at the end of the American Civil War. The branch&#x27;s first train used a Grice &amp; Long wood-burning steam dummy for passenger service, and took about 20 minutes each way. The Pennsylvania Railroad leased and began to operate the C&amp;A, including the Princeton Branch, in 1871. The branch was re-aligned and double-tracked in 1905 to handle popular college football weekends, upgraded from coal to a gasoline-electric train in 1933, fully electrified in 1936, and single-tracked again in 1956. The 1956 rail bridge over U.S. Route 1 was replaced in 1994 to allow further widening of the highway.

Penn Central Transportation took over operations in 1968, and discontinued the little-used Penns Neck station in 1971. When Conrail was formed in 1976, the Final System Plan called for the transfer of the Princeton Branch to Conrail and then to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, but the transfer to NJDOT was not made until 1984.

===University highlights===
The Princeton train, locally called the &quot;Dinky&quot; or the &quot;PJ&amp;B&quot; (for &quot;Princeton Junction and Back&quot;), is a unique symbol of Princeton University that has grown over time to emblemize the university. It is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, featured in the television program &quot;Family Ties&quot; when young Alex Keaton goes for his on-campus interview, and it is also in the 1934 Bing Crosby movie &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;. The theme of Princeton and the train is repeated in the university&#x27;s own traditional homecoming song &quot;Going Back to Nassau Hall&quot; by Kenneth S. Clark (Class of 1905). In it, the lyric &quot;We&#x27;ll clear the track as we go back&quot; refers to the Princeton Branch track leading to the campus.

The Great Dinky Robbery was an incident on May 3, 1963, in which four men boarded the Dinky and abducted four passengers. Princeton was not yet co-educational, and the Dinky was the usual mode of transportation for women dating members of the then all-male student body. On a Friday evening, four Princeton University students, riding horses in Western attire, ambushed the train as it was arriving at Princeton station. A convertible was parked across the track, forcing the Dinky to come to an abrupt halt. The men, including George R. Bunn Jr. of the Bunn coffee maker family, who was armed with a pistol loaded with blanks, boarded the train and persuaded four female passengers to leave with them. The Dinky later resumed its trip and arrived at Princeton station. Although the university administrators were aware of the event and may have known who was involved, they took no official action.

===Princeton station relocation and controversy===
In 2006, Princeton University announced its intention to construct a new arts center, calling for the replacement of the 1918 Princeton station house, the shortening of the trackage right-of-way, and the creation of a new terminus to the south. Rail advocates opposed the relocation, fearing that access to the new station would be less convenient, resulting in decreased ridership that could &quot;threaten the train&#x27;s existence.&quot; The proposal prompted protest from residents, students, faculty and alumni, and led to the creation of the organization &quot;Save the Dinky&quot; and a lengthy series of legal challenges. In October 2010, the Princeton Regional Planning Board passed a resolution supporting the continuation of train service. The new Princeton station opened on November 17, 2014, with construction continuing on a complex of arts and dining buildings in the surrounding area. , weekday ridership was down 20 percent from 2012, the last full year of the old station.

==Proposed Transitway==
The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and New Jersey Transit have conducted studies to develop the Central New Jersey Route 1 Bus Rapid Transit Project. Parts of the proposals call for the construction of a &quot;Dinky Transitway&quot; along the Princeton Branch right-of-way, which would incorporate the rail service and add exclusive bus lanes and a greenway for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.

In April 2012, the university submitted a revised plan for the arts and transit center, calling for the extension of the station&#x27;s freight house onto the right-of-way for possible use as a restaurant. The Regional Planning Board introduced an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend farther into Princeton&#x27;s central business district at Nassau Street. According to the university, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the transitway to be implemented. Approvals were subsequently issued for converting the station house and the extended freight house into a pair of restaurants.

<doc id="1304000" wikidata="Q2302824" url="?curid=1304000" title="Alraune">
<text>Alraune (German for ) is a novel by German novelist Hanns Heinz Ewers published in 1911. It is also the name of the female lead character. The book originally featured illustrations by Ilna Ewers-Wunderwald.
==Legend==
The basis of the story of Alraune dates to the Middle Ages in Germany. The humanoid-shaped mandrake root or &quot;Mandragora officinarum&quot; was widely believed to be produced by the semen of hanged men under the gallows. Alchemists claimed that hanged men ejaculated after their necks were broken and that the earth absorbed their final &quot;strengths&quot;. In some versions, it is blood instead of semen. The root itself was used in love philtres and potions while its fruit was supposed to facilitate pregnancy. Witches who &quot;made love&quot; to the mandrake root were said to produce offspring that had no feelings of real love and had no soul.
==Fiction==
The novel deviates from the myth by concentrating on the issues of artificial insemination and individuality: genetics versus environment. A scientist, Professor Jakob ten Brinken, interested in the laws of heredity, impregnates a prostitute in a laboratory with the semen of a hanged murderer. The prostitute conceives a female child who has no concept of love, whom the professor adopts. The girl, Alraune, suffers from obsessive sexuality and perverse relationships throughout her life. She learns of her unnatural origins and she avenges herself against the professor.

==Adaptations==
A number of films and other works are based on or inspired by the novel &quot;Alraune&quot;.

* 1918: &quot;Alraune&quot;, an 80-minute Hungarian movie which is now believed to be lost
* 1918: &quot;Alraune, die Henkerstochter, genannt die rote Hanne&quot;, an 88-minute German movie directed by Eugen Illés
* 1928: &quot;Alraune&quot;, also known as &quot;Unholy Love&quot;, a 125-minute black and white, silent German film directed by Henrik (Heinrich) Galeen. It stars Brigitte Helm as Alraune and Paul Wegener as the scientist Professor Jakob ten Brinken. It uses the novel and is regarded by critics as the definitive version of Alraune. When this film was first shown in Britain, film censors removed the details of the woman&#x27;s origins, thereby making the story and motivations confusing to British audiences.
* 1930: &quot;Alraune&quot;, also known as &quot;The Daughter of Evil&quot;, a 103-minute black and white German film directed by Richard Oswald and again starring Brigitte Helm as Alma Raune (Alraune). This was a sound remake of the 1928 film.
* 1952: &quot;Alraune&quot;, or &quot;The Unnatural&quot;, a black and white German feature film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt. This had an all-star German cast including Hildegard Knef as Alraune and Erich von Stroheim as the scientist.
* 1998–2004: &quot;Alraune&quot;, a series of black and white German comic books illustrated by Tony Greis. The comic books deviate significantly from the novel. The main character is cursed and must live as if she is Alraune until she can find a way out from under the curse.

<doc id="1304003" wikidata="Q780923" url="?curid=1304003" title="Wallasey">
<text>Wallasey () is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Cheshire, it is at the mouth of the River Mersey, on the north-eastern corner of the Wirral Peninsula. At the 2011 Census, the population was 60,284.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name of Wallasey originates from the Germanic word &quot;Walha&quot;, meaning a Briton, a Welshman, which is also the origin of the name Wales. The suffix “&quot;-ey&quot;” denotes an island or area of dry land. Originally the higher ground now occupied by Wallasey was separated from the rest of Wirral by the creek known as Wallasey Pool (which later became the docks), the marshy areas of Bidston Moss and Leasowe, and sand dunes along the coast.

===Early history===

The area was sparsely populated before the 19th century and horse races organised for the Earls of Derby on the sands at Leasowe in the 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as forerunners of the modern Derby.

Old maps show that the main centre and parish church (St Hilary&#x27;s) were located at what is now called Wallasey Village, and there were smaller hamlets at Liscard, Poulton and Seacombe, from where there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. There was also a mill (at Mill Lane), and from the mid-18th century a gunpowder store or magazine at Rock Point, located well away from the built-up areas. 
The main activities in the area were farming and fishing. The area also had a reputation for smuggling and “wrecking”, the act of luring ships onto rocks or sandbanks with false lights in order to raid their cargo. Underground cellars and tunnels, which were used to hide cargo pilfered from wrecked ships still exist in the town. As late as 1839, the “Pennsylvania” and two other ships were wrecked off Leasowe in a severe storm, and their cargoes and furnishings were later found distributed among local residents.

===Early 19th-century development===
By the early 19th century, the shoreline between Seacombe and Rock Point started to become an attractive area to which affluent Liverpool merchants and sea captains could retire. Development at Egremont began around this time, and gained pace with the introduction of steam ferries across the river. The area also had a defensive role overlooking the growing Port of Liverpool. In 1829, Fort Perch Rock was built, and in 1858 Liscard Battery.

In 1835 Liscard Hall was built by another merchant, Sir John Tobin. Its grounds later became Central Park. His family also developed a “model farm” nearby.

With the expansion of trade on the Mersey, new docks were constructed between 1842 and 1847 in the Wallasey Pool, and by 1877 the dock system between Wallasey and neighbouring Birkenhead was largely complete. The area around the docks became a centre for engineering industries, many associated with shipbuilding, and other activities including sugar refining and the manufacture of cement and fertilisers. Bidston Dock, the last in the area, was opened in 1933, but was filled in during 2003.

===Later growth and the 20th century===
During the latter half of the 19th century New Brighton developed as a popular seaside resort serving Liverpool and the Lancashire industrial towns, and many of the large houses were converted to inexpensive hotels. A pier was opened in the 1860s, and the promenade from Seacombe to New Brighton was built in the 1890s. This served both as a recreational amenity in its own right and to link up the developments along the estuary, and was later extended westwards towards Leasowe. The New Brighton Tower, the tallest in the country, was opened in 1900 but closed in 1919 and dismantled shortly afterwards. However, its ballroom continued as a major venue, hosting numerous concerts in the 1950s and 1960s by local Liverpool bands as well as other international stars. 

After 1886, with the opening of the Mersey Railway allowing access via a tunnel to Liverpool, the pace of housing development increased, particularly in the Liscard and Wallasey Village areas. The area now called Wallasey comprises several distinct districts which gradually merged to form a single built-up area during the 19th and early-20th centuries. Further growth continued well into the 20th century and eventually spread into the Leasowe area and beyond to Moreton.

The UK&#x27;s first guide dog training school, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, was founded in the town in 1931. A statue sits outside the Floral Pavilion Theatre to celebrate this.

The Wallasey Golf Club is where club member, Dr Frank Stableford, developed the Stableford system of points scoring. This was first used in competition in 1932.

Because of its docks and proximity to Liverpool, parts of the area suffered aerial bombing in 1940–41. After the Second World War, the popularity of New Brighton as a seaside resort declined dramatically, as did the use of the docks, and Wallasey gradually became more obviously a residential suburb for Liverpool, Birkenhead, and the other towns in the area.

The Beatles played some of their first shows outside Liverpool at the Grosvenor Ballroom in Liscard in 1960, and over the next few years also played several times at the Tower Ballroom in New Brighton. On 12 October 1962, they played there as the support act for Little Richard. Wallasey was also the home base of two other leading Merseybeat groups, the Undertakers featuring Jackie Lomax, and the Pressmen featuring Ritchie Prescott and Phil Kenzie who later became a successful saxophone soloist.

The world&#x27;s first passenger hovercraft service operated from July 1962 to September 1962 between Leasowe and Rhyl in North Wales. Local MP Ernest Marples was responsible as Minister of Transport (1959–64) for introducing parking meters, yellow lines, and seat belt controls to the UK.

The &quot;Solar Campus&quot; on Leasowe Road was the first building in the world to be heated entirely by solar energy. It was formerly St George&#x27;s Secondary School, and was completed in 1961 to the designs of Emslie Morgan. The solar panels on this establishment have since been removed due to high costs and has been renamed.

Wallasey was struck by an F1/T3 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

===Civic history===

Wallasey became a County Borough in 1913, and its town hall was officially opened in November 1920. The borough boundaries expanded to include Moreton and Saughall Massie in 1928.

The County Borough of Wallasey was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral on 1 April 1974. The town is contained in the parliamentary constituency of Wallasey, which has been held since the 1992 general election by Angela Eagle of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
Wallasey is situated at the north-east of the Wirral Peninsula, on the western side of the River Mersey and adjoining the Irish Sea. The area is approximately east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Hoylake. Wallasey is at an elevation of between above sea level, with the highest point being around St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church in New Brighton.

The area now called Wallasey comprises several distinct districts - Egremont, Liscard, New Brighton, Poulton, Seacombe and Wallasey Village. These gradually merged to form a single built-up area during the 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Unlike in most other towns, there is no single Wallasey town centre, although the main shopping area is centrally located at Liscard. Both the parliamentary constituency and the former County Borough of Wallasey also include (or included) Leasowe, Moreton and Saughall Massie, which are now usually regarded as separate settlements.

The town forms part of the wider Birkenhead Urban Area, which in 2011 had a population of 325,000.

=== Liscard ===

This contains the main shopping area, with the covered Cherry Tree precinct and an extensive shopping parade outside. Central Park, originally the grounds of Liscard Hall, is the largest park in the town. Much of the area is residential and contains mainly high-density semi-detached housing with some terraces. The gatehouse of the old Liscard Battery remains.

Liscard Hall was destroyed by a fire on 7 July 2008. The damage was so severe, the whole building had to be demolished.

=== Wallasey Village ===
Wallasey Village has a mixture of mostly 20th century semi-detached and detached housing, a shopping street, with a floral roundabout in the centre. St Hilary&#x27;s Church is an ancient foundation; the old tower is all that remains of a 1530 church building which burned down in 1857. There are two railway stations, Wallasey Village and Wallasey Grove Road. At the north end of Wallasey Village, the main street leads to the promenade and coastal park, and two golf courses. The promenade passes here, running from the &#x27;Gunsite&#x27; around to Seacombe, a total of over .

=== New Brighton ===

New Brighton was a popular seaside resort after the mid-19th century, but declined in popularity after the 1950s. Nevertheless, the marine promenade is part of a walkway and the areas near the sea offer a much improved beach and many leisure activities. The Floral Pavilion plays host to regular productions and national stars such as Ken Dodd, and Vale Park is a public park. Housing here ranges from large villas near the sea to suburban semi-detached homes, and some terraces in parts of the area. New Brighton is served by a railway station of the same name.

=== Poulton ===
Poulton was originally a small fishing and farming hamlet beside the Wallasey Pool (hence its name). It developed with the growth of the docks, mainly as an industrial and terraced housing area.

=== Egremont ===
Egremont developed as an affluent residential area in the early 19th century, and was named by one Captain Askew who built a house in the area in 1835 and named it after his Cumberland birthplace.

=== Seacombe ===
Seacombe, the most southeasterly section of Wallasey, is best known for its Mersey Ferry terminal, with regular ferry boat departures to Pier Head in Liverpool and Woodside in Birkenhead. There is a commuter ferry service direct to Liverpool during peak hours, while for the rest of the day the ferries are geared to serving tourists with a circular cruise visiting Birkenhead Woodside ferry terminal as well. Seacombe is the last remaining of the three ferry terminals which used to connect the Borough of Wallasey, the others being Egremont Ferry and the New Brighton Ferry, which operated from its own pier, running parallel to the New Brighton pleasure pier. Seacombe Ferry is also the starting point of a unbroken promenade, mostly traffic-free, running alongside the River Mersey to Harrison Drive beyond New Brighton.

Local landmarks are St Paul&#x27;s Church, standing on its own traffic island, and the ventilation tower for the Kingsway Tunnel with its mighty extraction fans. As with Poulton, the area developed with housing for the dockworkers and nearby industries, and much of the housing is owned by Magenta Housing or is terraced. The Guinea Gap swimming baths are located between Seacombe and Egremont.

== Transport ==
===Roads===
The following roads connect to Wallasey:
* The Kingsway Tunnel was opened by Queen Elizabeth II when it was completed in 1971. Its roadway route via Poulton leads to its entrance in Seacombe, which links Wallasey with the centre of Liverpool. It was featured in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1&quot;.
* The M53 motorway begins in Poulton; it leads south through the centre of the Wirral Peninsula to Chester and into the M56 motorway, which continues to Manchester Airport.
* The North Wallasey Approach Road begins in Wallasey Village and ends in Bidston at junction 1 of the M53.
* Leasowe Road gives access to Leasowe and Moreton to the west, and to Wallasey Village to the east.

===Railway===
The town has three railway stations: , and . Merseyrail operates electric trains to on the Wirral line every 15 minutes during the day; this reduces to 30 minutes in late evenings and on Sundays.

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are operated primarily by Arriva North West, Stagecoach Merseyside and Al&#x27;s Coaches. Routes connect Wallasey with nearby towns including Birkenhead, Leasowe and Moreton; the 423 provides a regular service to Whitechapel, Liverpool.

Until 1969, Wallasey had its own corporation bus service; from this date, the operation was taken over by Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive. The Wallasey bus service was relatively constrained within the borough boundaries and had two distinctive features. One was the unusual livery, which appeared to be two shades of yellow (officially it was &quot;sea green and rich cream&quot;, but it always looked yellow and the service was generally known as the &quot;yellow buses&quot;). Secondly, the services mostly radiated from Seacombe Ferry terminal across the borough and bus departures coincided with the arrival of the ferry. Vehicles were lined up facing outwards from the kerb and, every 10–15 minutes, the passengers (several hundreds at peak hours) would arrive from the ferry boat. When all had boarded their respective routes, the inspector in charge would blow a whistle and there would be an amazing Le Mans-style start with up to fifteen double-decker buses, including racing engines, close manoeuvring and competitive gestures between the crews for the first few hundred yards until the routes gradually diverged across the borough.

<text>Slindon is a mostly rural village and civil parish in the Arun District of West Sussex, England, containing a developed nucleus amid woodland. Much of Slindon&#x27;s woodland belongs to the National Trust on the southern edge of the escarpment of the South Downs National Park. Slindon is centred north-east of Chichester.
Within the village is situated two schools, Slindon Church of England Primary School, a state funded primary school for boys and girls aged 4-11, and Slindon College, an specialist independent day and boarding school for boys aged 8-18, which officially opened in 1972. 

== History ==
The village is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Eslindone&quot;, the name having the probable meaning in Old English of &quot;sloping hill&quot;. The Domesday Book records Slindon as having 35 households, putting it in the top 20% of settlements.

St Mary&#x27;s 12th-century parish church contains a memorial to Stephen Langton (c1150–1228), the Archbishop of Canterbury who attended the signing of Magna Carta and who died in Slindon.

In the Middle Ages Slindon House (now Slindon College) was the site of one of the Archbishop&#x27;s residences. In 1330 Thomas de Natindon, who was a legal representative of the Pope, was sent there to serve a writ on the archbishop. His party were not well received by the archbishop&#x27;s servants who stripped and bound them, then threw cold water over them, apparently with the archbishop&#x27;s consent. Natindon escaped revenge and was pursued over the hills to Petworth where he was caught and held in prison for three days.

The village war memorial was unveiled in 1921, with the names of 14 residents killed in World War I; a further three names were added after World War II.

The writer Hilaire Belloc (1870–1953) lived in the village.

In the mid-18th century, Slindon Cricket Club achieved fame through the excellence of its team which featured Richard Newland (1713–1778).

==Amenities==
In May 2012, the process began of renovating and converting the old village forge into a shop, café and information centre; this opened on 16 October 2012.

The village has been called the &quot;pumpkin capital of Britain&quot;, and an annual display of pumpkins attracts tourists to the village.

A short walk from the village is Nore Folly (aka Slindon Folly), a structure built during the 18th century by the Newburgh family, whose seat was at Slindon. The Folly resembles a gateway but leads to nowhere.

===Former amenities===
Slindon post office closed in 2008. The Newburgh Arms closed in 2001.

<text>&quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; is a poem written by William Wordsworth, a representative of the Romantic movement in English literature. The poem was composed in spring 1798 and first published in the same year in &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, a collection of poems written by Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which is considered to be a turning point in the history of English literature and the Romantic movement. The poem investigates such themes as language, intellectual disability, maternity, emotionality (excessive or otherwise), organisation of experience and &quot;transgression of the natural.&quot;

&quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; is Wordsworth&#x27;s longest poem in &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (with 463 lines), although it is surpassed in length by Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot; It was the 16th poem of the collection in the original 1798 edition, and the 21st poem in the 1800 edition, which added Wordsworth&#x27;s famous Preface to Lyrical Ballads.

==Summary of the plot==

The poem tells the story of the titular &quot;Idiot Boy,&quot; as well as his mother Betty Foy and their gravely ill neighbour Susan Gale. As Johnny&#x27;s father, a woodsman, is away from home, Betty decides to send her son to the nearest town on horseback, so that he may bring with him a doctor who could help Susan. However, Johnny gets lost trying to reach the town at night, and his mother is forced to follow him. When she reaches the doctor&#x27;s house, she realizes Johnny is not there and returns home in a state of agitation, forgetting to bring the doctor with her. Eventually, Johnny is reunited with his mother, and their neighbour rises from her bed, miraculously cured.

==Form==

The poem uses a five-line stanza of tetrameter lines, with a rhyming scheme of ABCCB, said to be a &quot;variation on the long meter quatrain.&quot; It has been described as a realisation of the traditional form of the ballad, chiefly because of its &quot;unobtrusive&quot; narrator, as well as &quot;an extreme example of the naive or rustic style in poetry.&quot;

===Balladic Elements===

The poem contains allusions to many romantic ballad commonplaces, connected mainly with Gottfried August Bürger&#x27;s ballads &quot;Lenore&quot; and &quot;The Wild Huntsman.&quot; This is exemplified mainly by the mock-heroic section of the poem (lines 322-356), as well as its opening stanza (lines 1-6), where moonlight and the presence of owls take centre stage as the attributes of the ballad:

&lt;poem&gt;
&#x27;T&#x27;is eight o&#x27;clock – a clear March night,
&#x27;The moon is up – the sky is blue,
&#x27;The owlet in the moonlight air,
He shouts from nobody knows where
He lengthens out his lonely shout,
Halloo! halloo! a long halloo!&lt;/poem&gt;

Johnny has been dubbed &quot;a Quixotic hero,&quot; as well as a knight errant, and an allusion to Don Quixote has been found in the narrator&#x27;s vision of Johnny hunting sheep in line 337 of the poem. He has been connected to &quot;a long tradition of fools,&quot; as the poem explores his extraordinary, unorthodox perception of the world. The poem, however, seems to emphasise a defamiliarization of such clichés, rather than emulate them. The poem&#x27;s connection to the ballad genre has also been described as tenuous, as it is said to exhibit a shift in focus from the exploration of a plot to the exploration of abstract feeling.

===The Narrator===

The narrator of &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; is considered to be &quot;comic,&quot; as well as &quot;dramatized,&quot; &quot;highly limited&quot; and even &quot;incompetent.&quot; He is described as a poetic figure &quot;variously affected&quot; by the story he narrates, and thus both &quot;detached&quot; from and &quot;engaged&quot; in the events of the poem. Though he is not directly involved in the story of the poem himself, certain qualities of his &quot;may be inferred from [his] stylistic habits,&quot; as well as the parts of the poem in which he addresses his audience.

The narrator&#x27;s attitude towards Johnny seems benevolent, however he criticises Betty with &quot;a trace of patronizing condescension&quot; in lines 22-26: 

&lt;poem&gt;
The world will say &#x27;tis very idle,
Bethink you of the time of night;
There&#x27;s not a mother, no not one.
But when she hears what you have done.
Oh! Betty she&#x27;ll be in a fright.&lt;/poem&gt;

Condescension may also be found in the narrator&#x27;s description of Johnny as a &quot;fierce and dreadful hunter,&quot; (338) as well as in his negative response to Betty&#x27;s imaginings about her son&#x27;s fate (lines 212-216).

&lt;poem&gt;
So, through the moonlight lane she goes,
And far into the moonlight dale;
And how she ran, and how she walked,
And all that to herself she talked,
would surely be a tedious tale.&lt;/poem&gt;

However, he is said to be just as much a source of speculation as she is, as he strives to &quot;fill in the gaps of his story&quot; with &quot;fanciful adventure.&quot;

Out of ninety stanzas of the poem, approximately one third of them begin with the conjunctions &quot;and,&quot; &quot;but&quot; or &quot;so,&quot; which suggests that its narrator is focused chiefly on a simple, sequential retelling of the story. He also seems prone to simplifying the character&#x27;s experience into simple binary opposites, such as when referring to the life or death of Susan Gale (52-56), in Betty&#x27;s instructions to Johnny (62-66; &quot;[h]ow to turn left and how to right&quot;) or in the description of her search for him (217-221).

&lt;poem&gt;
In high and low, above, below,
ln great and small, in round and square,
In tree and tower was Johnny seen,
In bush and brake, in black and green,
&#x27;Twas Johnny, Johnny everywhere.&lt;/poem&gt;

Despite this, some evidence of the narrator&#x27;s skilfulness has been identified in his usage of humour and deliberate poetic structures, such as the recurring theme of the owls.

====The Muses====

The mock-heroic fragment of the poem (lines 322-356) may be read as a &quot;self-conscious comment on the narrator&#x27;s efforts,&quot; as he expresses affection towards his muses in a way similar to how Betty&#x27;s affection towards Johnny is portrayed (compare &quot;Ye muses! Whom I love so well&quot; (356) with &quot;Him whom she loves, her idiot boy&quot; (lines 16 and 376). The narrator&#x27;s appeal to the muses has also been described as a way to comment on the anxiousness which readers may experience expecting a full account of the titular character&#x27;s &quot;strange adventures&quot; (351), as they would in more traditional sentimental stories.

In lines 347-348 the narrator claims that he has practised poetry (been &quot;bound&quot; to the muses) for fourteen years, which is a fact true about Wordsworth in the moment of writing the poem. These lines have been read to suggest the narrator&#x27;s incompetence, as trades would typically be learnt in a period of seven years. However, the narrator has also been dubbed a &quot;deliberately naïve version of [Wordsworth],&quot; not to be confused with the author himself, but rather to be identified with a &quot;narrow-minded&quot; and &quot;excessively genteel&quot; style of poetry criticised by Wordsworth.

===Humour===

&quot;The Idiot Boy&#x27;s&quot; tone is considered to be comedic. Its humour has been dubbed a &quot;defence against the ominous threats facing Johnny,&quot; as well as a &quot;burlesque&quot; of the philosophical discourse of intellectual disability in the Enlightenment, as by &quot;mocking the reader&#x27;s sense of decorum&quot; the poem seems to challenge literary and social preconceptions.

The sources of humour in the poem have been found in the contrast between the fragments devoted to Johnny and Betty and the elements of the narrator&#x27;s mock-heroic voice, as well as the comedic force of Betty&#x27;s failure to ask for the doctor&#x27;s help joint with Susan&#x27;s miraculous recovery. Thus, the poem&#x27;s humour has been classified as &quot;one of happy resolution.&quot;

==Characters and Themes==

===Moonlight and the Supernatural===

Supernatural elements of the poem are found chiefly in Betty&#x27;s visions of Johnny&#x27;s undoing (lines 232-241) and in the narrator&#x27;s mock-heroic section (322-356):

&lt;poem&gt;
&#x27;Oh saints! what is become of him?
Perhaps he&#x27;s climbed into an oak,
Where he will stay until he is dead;
Or, sadly he has been misled,
And joined the wandering gipsy-folk.

&#x27;Or him that wicked pony&#x27;s carried
To the dark cave, the goblin&#x27;s hall;
Or in the castle he&#x27;s pursuing,
Among the ghosts his own undoing;
Or playing with the waterfall.&#x27;&lt;/poem&gt;

Betty imagines her son&#x27;s downfall to be caused by goblins (238) or ghosts (240), but the narrator disregards her concerns, describing them as &quot;unworthy&quot; and &quot;wild&quot;: 

Betty&#x27;s superstitious speculation has been described as her way of dealing with her anxiety for Johnny – namely the fear of him dying (suggested by his &quot;playing with the waterfall&quot; in line 241). Her anxious behaviour is also found to contrast with the aura of peaceful &quot;transcendence&quot; evoked by the moonlight. The moon, in turn, is identified with Johnny&#x27;s &quot;other-worldliness,&quot; as he experiences the uncanniness of the night.

Despite its abundance of supernatural elements, the poem has been found to be focused rather on &quot;social commentary&quot; in line with Wordsworth&#x27;s aim &quot;to give the charm of novelty to things of every day&quot; (as described by Coleridge).

===Johnny Foy and Intellectual Disability===

Johnny Foy exhibits non-normative behaviour and atypical verbal expression, which has led critics to interpret his condition as intellectual disability. &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; is said to explore how such disabilities are mythologized in order to establish them as a proper subject for linguistic and psychologic deliberations, and it has been connected with &quot;an emergent &#x27;humane&#x27; understanding of cognitive difference.&quot;

The poem&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;idiot&quot; has been said to carry &quot;connotations of deficiency,&quot; and the word itself has been counted amongst those used &quot;to provoke revulsion or to ostracize groups of people.&quot;

Johnny&#x27;s condition is said to transgress &quot;the limits of being,&quot; as well as the &quot;binary oppositions of order and disorder, reason and idiocy, [...] purity and disgust.&quot; He has also been connected with the poem&#x27;s subversion of romantic conventions, as he himself is free of any literary and socio-cultural preconceptions.

Although Johnny&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s roles in the poem are discussed at length, his father is notably absent from the poem and only mentioned by his profession in lines 37-39.

====Johnny&#x27;s Joy and Poeticism====

Michael Mason claims that Johnny experiences &quot;Wordsworthian joy,&quot; a state in which a passive observer perceives natural phenomena &quot;in themselves,&quot; with no outside point of reference, as illustrated by Johnny&#x27;s misclassification of owl cries and the moon in lines 447-463:

&lt;poem&gt;
For, while they all were travelling home,
Cried Betty &#x27;Tell us, Johnny, do,
Where all this long night you have been,
What you have heard, what you have seen,
And, Johnny, mind you tell us true.&#x27;

Now Johnny all night long had heard
The owls in tuneful concert strive;
No doubt too he the moon had seen;
For in the moonlight he had been
From eight o&#x27;clock till five.

And thus, to Betty&#x27;s question, he
Made answer, like a traveller bold
(His very words I give to you),
&#x27;The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,
And the sun did shine so cold,&#x27; –
Thus answered Johnny in his glory,
And that was all his travel&#x27;s story.&lt;/poem&gt;

This sense of joy has also been connected with an escape from the restrained world of rationality into one where language is &quot;subordinate to feeling.&quot; Johnny&#x27;s account of his journey has been said to present him as an &quot;imaginative&quot; and &quot;poetic&quot; figure, as he seems to creatively organise his new experience. However, although this is identified with &quot;poetic insight,&quot; Johnny all the same fails to reach the doctor and let him help his neighbour.

This portrayal seems to criticise the popular perception of intellectually disabled people in the Enlightenment, as it would likely lead to Johnny being read as &quot;revolting&quot; or &quot;inhuman&quot; due to his disability, in line with Coleridge&#x27;s remark that Wordsworth has not &quot;taken sufficient care to preclude from the reader&#x27;s fancy the disgusting images of ordinary, morbid idiocy.&quot;

Furthermore, Johnny&#x27;s apparent lack of reason, contrasted with the suggestion that his horse is both capable of thought and that he &quot;thinks of [Johnny] as &#x27;what&#x27; rather than &#x27;whom&#x27;&quot; in lines 121-126, has been connected with John Locke&#x27;s classification of &quot;changelings&quot; – a species between humans and animals.

&lt;poem&gt;
But then he is a horse that thinks!
And when he thinks his pace is slack,
Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,
Yet for his life he cannot tell
What he has got upon his back.&lt;/poem&gt;

Despite his failure, Johnny&#x27;s experience is said to be &quot;cathartic for [his] entire community,&quot; transforming it &quot;into a more integral and caring&quot; one, as he, his mother and their neighbour are once more brought together.

===Abuse of Language===

Abuse of language similar to Johnny&#x27;s is prevalent throughout the poem, as exemplified by Susan&#x27;s miraculous recovery, made possible when she recovers as she regains &quot;control over her utterance,&quot; and by the doctor&#x27;s ironic lines (262-271), which subvert the expectations one might hold towards a member of his profession and the principles of the Hippocratic Oath.

&lt;poem&gt;
&#x27;Oh doctor! doctor! Where&#x27;s my Johnny?&#x27;
&#x27;I&#x27;m here, what is&#x27;t you want with me?&#x27;
&#x27;Oh sir! you know I&#x27;m Betty Foy,
And I have lost my poor dear boy,
You know him – him you often see;

&#x27;He&#x27;s not so wise as some folks be.&#x27;
&#x27;The devil take his wisdom!&#x27; said
The doctor, looking somewhat grim,
&#x27;What, woman! should I know of him?&#x27;
And, grumbling, he went back to bed.&lt;/poem&gt;

Even the narrator may be characterised by a similar linguistic inefficiency, as he is unable to continue his narrative in lines 352-356 due to what Gordon Thomas calls his &quot;aphasia.&quot;

&lt;poem&gt;
O gentle Muses! is this kind?
Why will ye thus my suit repel?
Why of your further aid bereave me?
And can ye thus unfriendly, leave me;
Ye Muses! whom I love so well.&lt;/poem&gt;

Johnny&#x27;s seemingly rational mother also fails to keep her composure throughout the poem, as signified by line 249 (&quot;Unworthy things she talked and wild&quot;).

====&quot;Burring&quot;====

The word &quot;burr&quot; is often used in the poem (lines 19, 107, 115, 387) to refer to a sound made by Johnny, which has been classified as his &quot;physiological response to the cold,&quot; as well as a mimicry of the owls, or his steed. Betty, however, interprets it as &quot;the noise he loves&quot; (line 110). This may be read as faulty, as the &quot;burr&quot; may not have any meaning to him after all, or, conversely, as accurate, as it may signify that Johnny&#x27;s noises are &quot;perfectly comprehensible&quot; to him and his loved ones.

&lt;poem&gt;
Burr, burr – now Johnny&#x27;s lips they burr,
As loud as any mill, or near it;
Meek as a lamb the pony moves,
And Johnny makes the noise he loves,
And Betty listens, glad to hear it.&lt;/poem&gt;

Johnny&#x27;s &quot;burring&quot; has been likened to Wordsworth&#x27;s own – that is, to his Northumberland accent, &quot;characterized by a strong, guttural pronunciation of &#x27;r,&#x27;&quot; and to his narrator&#x27;s stylistic mistakes, which suggest that his &quot;competency as a storyteller is limited.&quot; These include overuse of repetition (lines 82-86, 92-96, 177-181), as well as distortion of &quot;syntax for the sake of rhyme&quot; (lines 365-366) and &quot;an exaggerated inversion of normal word order&quot; (in lines 34-36, in which the usage of the verb &quot;ail&quot; is simultaneously transitive and intransitive, and thus logically indecipherable).

&lt;poem&gt;
But when the pony moved his legs,
Oh! then for the poor Idiot Boy!
For joy he cannot hold the bridle,
For joy his head and heels are idle,
He&#x27;s idle all for very joy. (82-86)

Old Susan lies a-bed in pain,
And sorely puzzled are the twain,
For what she ails they cannot guess. (34-36)&lt;/poem&gt;

This abuse of &quot;poetic diction,&quot; however, has been characterised as an element of Wordsworth&#x27;s critique of the use of popular language in poetry, and as &quot;evidence not of Wordsworth&#x27;s failure as a poet but of his skill&quot; in &quot;defining his dramatized narrator.&quot;

===Betty Foy and &quot;Maternal Passion&quot;===

In the Preface to Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth expressed his aim to portray human nature by &quot;tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings.&quot; Betty&#x27;s approach to her son has, however, been dubbed by John Wilson as &quot;almost unnatural&quot; and by Coleridge as &quot;an impersonation of an instinct abandoned by judgement,&quot; signifying that Wordsworth&#x27;s contemporaries found the poem &quot;lacking&quot; in this regard.

Wilson&#x27;s criticism of Betty&#x27;s affection towards her son has been said to follow a sense of reciprocal sympathy described by Adam Smith in his Theory of Moral Sentiments, as, in that view, &quot;no self-respecting mother ought to adore a son so indifferent to and incapable of returning love.&quot; Betty&#x27;s inability to understand Johnny&#x27;s burring has also been said to signify her being &quot;incapable of representing him&quot; in a perception of intellectual disability contemporary to Wordsworth.

Wordsworth&#x27;s portrayal of Betty has been connected with the exploration of &quot;his ability to love like a mother (totally, vulnerably or irrationally [...]),&quot; as even her and Johnny&#x27;s surname (Foy) has been connected with the French word &quot;foi&quot; meaning faith.

Betty has also been ascribed the role of the poet due to her accounts of Johnny&#x27;s adventure. This role, in turn, allows for the narrator to be read as her double, guilty of the same susceptibility to emotions in his reports, which &quot;exposes [his] poetic pretension and lack of self-awareness.&quot; The narrator and Betty are therefore jointly described as &quot;[representing] debased popular poets,&quot; whereas Johnny stands as &quot;the heroic poet of the [creative] Imagination,&quot; as opposed to their superfluous fancy.

==Reception==

&quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; was counted amongst &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;&#x27; most experimental and controversial poems in the perception of its early reviewers. In the period of 1798-1800 it was reprinted only once, in 80 lines, in the issue of Critical Review for October 1798, in which it was famously criticised by Robert Southey as &quot;[resembling] a Flemish picture in the worthlessness of its design and the excellence of its execution.&quot;

The poem was generally negatively described by John Wilson and Coleridge. William Hazlitt wrote that he felt &quot;a &quot;chaunt&quot; in the recitation&quot; of the poems declaimed to him by Wordsworth and Coleridge, including &quot;The Idiot Boy, which would &quot;[act] as a spell upon the hearer, and [disarm] the judgment&quot;. Hazlitt&#x27;s remarks may suggest that despite any criticism he might have had towards the poems delaimed, they were signified by an effective use of meter (though possibly misleadingly so).

Marilyn Butler writes that &quot;most of the [reviewers of the &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;] praised poems which use an elevated language and subject, like &#x27;Tintern Abbey,&#x27; and attacked those using a &#x27;mean&#x27; language and subject, like &#x27;The Idiot Boy.&#x27;&quot; In line with this, Janina Nordius comments that &quot;great talent wasted on a dubious topic seems to be the dominant critical view&quot; of the poem, and Roger Murray claims that &quot;no one has warmly defended&quot; it. Murray also finds the poem to have &quot;too little grace [...] ever to be ranked alongside Wordsworth&#x27;s greatest poems,&quot; though he sees its portrayal of Betty as its saving grace.

Conversely, Michael Mason remarked that &quot;The Idiot Boy,&quot; as one of &quot;the more ballad-like of Wordsworth&#x27;s contributions [in Lyrical Ballads,] was generally well received,&quot; and Albert E. Wilhelm claimed it was &quot;one of Wordsworth&#x27;s best known but least appreciated&quot; poems.

===Quality===

The &quot;Idiot Boy&quot; been described as &quot;incongruous&quot; and as &quot;a failure&quot; by Geoffrey H. Hartman, as its repetitions &quot;draw too much attention to Wordsworth&#x27;s own &#x27;burring,&#x27;&quot; Joshua King argues, however, that such features are &quot;what make[s] [the poem] interesting,&quot; as they suggest &quot;a human community made possible by blind patterns of sensation, pleasure and habit, rather than primarily by rationality and linguistic ability.&quot;

Jonathan Wordsworth dubbed the poem a &quot;comic masterpiece&quot; and &quot;an almost faultless work of art,&quot; as well as &quot;a creation of exquisite tact, at once humorous and deeply moving.&quot; In line with this, John F. Danby comments that the tone of the poem is &quot;beautifully mock-solemn and yet indulgently ready with its sympathy,&quot; and Daniel Robinson claims that &quot;the warm comedic tones, which never mock the boy, complement perfectly the affection his mother feels, and the affection [the] reader ought to feel for him,&quot; though the poem &quot;subverts the sentimentality readers would have expected from a poem on mental disability in a newspaper or magazine of the time.&quot; Although the poem &quot;appears frivolous&quot; with its &quot;feminine rhymes, overblown diction and laughable characters,&quot; Karen Guendel argues that it warrants a second, more in-depth look due to its subversion of expectations and metaliterary critique of its own narrator.

Wordsworth&#x27;s transgressions have, however, been noted by Anne McWhir to &quot;[prevent] us from noticing&quot; his perpetuation of the binary oppositions of what is vulgar and proper, as he strives to select the latter kind of language for his poetry. Zoe Beenstock has also criticised the poem&#x27;s aims at recontextualising intellectual disability, claiming that Wordsworth &quot;remains focused on the able-bodied interlocutors who learn to value their own freedom by watching the spectacle of disability and dependence.&quot;

===Responses to Johnny===

Responses to Johnny&#x27;s condition seem to range from condescending dismissal to explorations of his state of being which classify it as serious, &quot;in touch with the divine&quot; or &quot;extra human,&quot; as he is found to have access to &quot;other dimensions&quot; of perception, both &quot;natural and divine.&quot; Johnny has even been said to represent an ideal Wordsworthian poet, a liminal figure &quot;between childhood and manhood,&quot; as well as &quot;the earthly and the divine,&quot; due to his disability.

Daniel Robinson argues that &quot;although calling Johnny an &#x27;idiot&#x27; seems callous,&quot; he is portrayed &quot;without sentimentality or pathos and with great respect.&quot; On the negative side, Wordsworth&#x27;s portrayal of Johnny has also been described as &quot;ludicrous.&quot;

===Responses to Betty===

Joshua King claims that the author&#x27;s contemporaries were unable to sympathise with Betty Foy, as her love for Johnny transgressed their &quot;standards of propriety,&quot; defined by &quot;rationality and the clear use of language.&quot; Conversely, modern criticism has largely found the poem &quot;faithful to [Wordsworth&#x27;s] objective.&quot;

Roger Murray claims that &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; displays &quot;the evolution&quot; of a mother&#x27;s mind. He also finds Betty to be the true main character of the poem, instead of Johnny, as it is mainly her search for Johnny that the narrative follows. Similarly, G. H. Durrant claims that &quot;the essential meaning of the poem&quot; is conveyed in how Betty&#x27;s love &quot;leads [Johnny] safely and serenely through [his] perils,&quot; while she &quot;suffers fear and anguish on his behalf.&quot; Zachary Leader, however, argues for the opposite, claiming that it is Johnny&#x27;s &quot;oddity&quot; that &quot;takes centre stage&quot; in the poem.

Karen Guendel has noted that the poem &quot;invites us to question Betty&#x27;s judgement,&quot; and that, in light of her reckless decision to send out her son into the night and her failure to acquire help for her neighbour, it is her fancy that motivates her decision-making, rather than her love for Johnny or her rationality, as she &quot;daydreams idly, casting Johnny and herself as the hero and heroine of various shopworn plots.&quot; This, according to Guendel, may be read as Wordsworth&#x27;s critique of sensationalist popular literature.

===Author&#x27;s Comments===

Wordsworth commented on the &quot;purpose&quot; of the poem in the 1802 Preface to Lyrical Ballads, saying that it adheres to his goal to &quot;follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affectations of our nature&quot; by &quot;tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings.&quot; In the Fenwick Notes he explained:

Wordsworth&#x27;s fondness of the poem has been identified &quot;a frustrated desire for his dead mother,&quot; Ann Wordsworth, though this claim has also been disputed as too simplistic an assumption. His and his narrator&#x27;s pleasure in narration have also been connected with the exploration of transgressive maternal love, melancholy and &quot;the originary deviance of poetry.&quot; 

Wordsworth&#x27;s sister, Dorothy Wordsworth, was similarly &quot;enchanted&quot; with the poem.

====Responses to Criticism====

Wordsworth defended the poem against John Wilson&#x27;s critique in his letter from 7 June 1802, claiming that his negative response to &quot;an Idiot&quot; as the subject of the poem was caused by &quot;petty social prejudice&quot; of the higher social strata, enabled by their ability to isolate themselves from intellectually disabled people. He also commented that he wrote the poem with &quot;exceeding delight and pleasure,&quot; and claimed that his usage of the word &quot;idiot&quot; was unavoidable, as he knew no better word &quot;to which we had attached passion&quot; to replace it with, mentioning &quot;lack-wit,&quot; &quot;half-wit,&quot; and &quot;witless&quot; as alternatives. This has been read as a signal of him &quot;[aiming] at the semantic reorientation&quot; of the word.

Wordsworth has been said to exoticize and glorify intellectually disabled people in his letter to Wilson, granting them &quot;visionary privilege.&quot;

He also partially conceded to Wilson&#x27;s concept of repulsion towards intellectual disability as an element of human nature, as what he claimed was the factor distinguishing Johnny from other intellectually disabled people, &quot;usually disgusting in their persons,&quot; was his ability to produce speech.

==Connections with other works==
* &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; as well as Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Somersetshire Tragedy&quot; have been connected with Thomas Poole&#x27;s &quot;John Walford&quot; – an account of a murder of an intellectually disabled woman called Jenny by her husband.
* Shortly before the publication of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, on 30 June 1798 issue of &quot; The Morning Post&quot; there appeared a poem titled &quot;The Idiot&quot; written by Robert Southey. In line with the contemporary &quot;standards of correctness,&quot; the poem avoids using a word similar to Johnny&#x27;s &quot;burr&quot; when describing the sounds made by an intellectually disabled person, instead using the phrase &quot;half artic&#x27;late call&quot; (line 10).
* Johnny&#x27;s voyage has been compared with the journey to the underworld taken by Virgil&#x27;s Aeneas in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, as the &quot;holly-bough&quot; that Johnny holds in his hand (mentioned in lines 57-61 and 87-91) seems to allude to the golden bough which Aeneas sought for safety in his travel, and as Virgil&#x27;s depiction of the underworld seems to reflect Betty&#x27;s vision of Johnny&#x27;s ill fate. The maternal love of Betty has also been connected with Cyrene&#x27;s strength-endowing &quot;effluence&quot; from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;.
* Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot; Barnaby Rudge &quot; has been said to &quot;[owe] something of his origin to Johnny Foy&quot;, as they share &quot;an undefined, good-natured dementia&quot; and are &quot;most fully connected with humanity through the unfailing devotion of their respective mothers.&quot;
* The poem&#x27;s narrator has been compared to Laurence Sterne&#x27;s Tristram Shandy, as they both have difficulty finishing their stories, and their respective invocations appear only towards the end of both works.
* Johnny&#x27;s account of his voyage has been connected with Henry Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;The Night,&quot; as &quot;the paradoxical interplay between sun and moon, heat and cold, darkness and light&quot; is likewise key to Vaughan&#x27;s poem.

===Other Works by Wordsworth===
* Wordsworth described &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; along with his &quot;The Mad Mother&quot; as poems pertaining to &quot;maternal passion&quot; in the Preface to Lyrical Ballads.
* Wordsworth mentions the plot of &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; in book XIV of his autobiographical poem &quot;The Prelude&quot; (lines 397-406). &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; has also been likened to the Winander boy episode of Book V of &quot;The Prelude,&quot; as both Johnny and the Winander boy echo the sound of the owls. The Snowdon episode of Book XIII of the 1805 edition of &quot;The Prelude&quot;, as well as Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;A Night Piece,&quot; have been connected with &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; as pieces &quot;featuring a lunar epiphany.&quot; 
* The moonlight is also mentioned in Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Peter Bell,&quot; which seems to allude to Johnny&#x27;s journey, and has even been dubbed the poem&#x27;s sequel.
* The narrator&#x27;s appeal to the muses has been connected with Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Simon Lee,&quot; the speaker of which similarly seems to &quot;[rebuke] his reader for wanting sentimental stories and arousing incidents.&quot;
* Johnny has been grouped with the leach-gatherer from &quot;Resolution and Independence&quot;, Luke from &quot;Michael&quot; and Lucy Gray as Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;[intermediaries] between [nature] and man&quot;.
* The poem has been grouped with other &quot;Pre-Goslar poems with vagrants or itinerants as subjects,&quot; such as &quot;The Thorn,&quot; &quot;The Mad Mother,&quot; &quot;Old Man Travelling&quot; and &quot;The Complaint of a forsaken Indian Woman&quot; as allusions to their &quot;substantial literary precedents (wandering bard or minstrel; pilgrim; knight-errant).&quot;

===Connections with Coleridge===
* The poem has been compared with Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Christabel&quot; as &quot;particularly valuable in tandem&quot; due to their &quot;complementary&quot; explorations &quot;of language, [its] divinity [...] and how [its] use and misuse [...] may at once both reveal and hide thoughts&quot;.
* The poem has been connected with Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner&quot; as well as Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Female Vagrant&quot; as &quot;a more light-hearted instance of [their] pattern of departure and return.&quot; Moreover, &quot;both Johnny and the [Mariner] have imaginative experiences illuminated by moonlight,&quot; and both poems &quot;conclude with a provocative undercutting of narrative expectations.&quot;
* Coleridge&#x27;s Osorio has also been noted to anticipate the motives of the owls, moonlight, caverns and the waterfall found in &quot;The Idiot Boy.&quot; 

===Parody===
* Wordsworth complains about an apparent parody of his poem written by Peter Bayley in his letter to Walter Scott from 16 October 1803. The poem was titled &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Wife.&quot;
* The poem has been alluded to in an anonymously published poem called &quot;Benjamin the Wagonner, A Ryghte merrie and conceited Tale in Verse&quot; printed in the 1819 Literary Gazette. Just as &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; describes the &quot;happy, happy, happy John&quot; (96), the parody speaks of &quot;Happy, happy, happy people / Happy, ignorant of law,&quot; imagined by Wordsworth on a visit to &quot;a fanciful country.&quot;
* George Byron alluded to &quot;The Idiot Boy&quot; in lines (259-266) of his 1840 poem called &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers: A Satire.&quot;

<text>Kenneth Robert Maxwell (born 3 February 1941) is a British historian of Iberia and Latin America, educated at Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton, Somerset, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge University (1960-1963) where he studied under Ronald Robinson, Edward Miller, Professor Sir Harry Hinsley and Johanthan Steinberg, and at Princeton University where his doctoral adviser was Professor Stanley J. Stein.
== Career ==
In 1963, Kenneth Maxwell studied at the University of Madrid and was a Gulbenkian grantee in Lisbon in 1964. In September 1964 he entered the graduate program in Latin American History at Princeton University where his supervisor was Professor Stanley Stein. 

Maxwell was a Newberry library-Gulbenkian fellow in Chicago (1968-1969)(newberry.org). He was appointed an assistant and later an associate professor of Luso-Brazilian history at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. In 1971 and 1972 he was the Herodotus fellow in the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Between 1972 and 1975 he remained at the Institute in the school of historical studies, with the support of a Rockefeller Foundation grant and in 1974-75 as a joint appointment in the school of historical studies and the newly established school of social sciences. He was a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow from 1975-76 (https://www.gf.org &gt; fellows &gt; k...), and was then appointed an associate professor of history at Columbia University (1976-1984), becoming the director of the Camões Center at Columbia University in 1988-1999. He was a senior fellow at the Research Institute on International Change at Columbia University from 1978-1992 and a Senior Research Associate at the Institute for Latin American Studies at Columbia University from 1992-2000. He was the program director of the Tinker Foundation (1979-1983). A long-time member of the Council on Foreign Relations for fifteen years, Maxwell headed its Latin America Studies Program and was the director of studies and vice-president in 1996. He was the first Nelson and David Rockefeller Senior Fellow for Inter-American Affairs (1996-2004) and was the Western Hemisphere book reviewer for Foreign Affairs from 1995 until 2004. His 13 May 2004 resignation from the council and Foreign Affairs involved a major controversy over whether there had been a breach of the so-called &quot;church-state separation&quot; between the council itself and its magazine &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. He endowed a Kenneth Maxwell thesis prize for the best senior thesis on Brazil at the David Rockafeller Center (https://rll.fas.harvard.edu &gt; pages &gt; kenneth - maxwell - the...) As well as a Kenneth Maxwell thesis prize for the best senior thesis on Brazil at Princeton University (https://plas.princeton.edu/certificate - programs/senior-thesis- prizes). As of 2004 Maxwell became a professor of History at Harvard University and a senior fellow at Harvard University David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, where he established and was the founding director the Brazil Studies Program (2004-2013). He was a weekly columnist for the &quot;Folha de São Paulo&quot; (2005-2015) and &quot;O Globo&quot; (2015- ) and has written for the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; and Defense.info (https://defense.info &gt; book &gt; ken...) and many other publications. He was a Visiting associate professor of Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University (1978–79), a Visiting Professor of History and Latin American Studies at Princeton (1985–86) and a Visiting Professor of History at Yale (1991–92). He donated his collection of books on Brazil, Portugal and Latin America to the Library of St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge University.

<text>Sheppard West (formerly Downsview) is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station, which is located near the intersection of Sheppard Avenue West and Allen Road, opened in 1996 in what was then the City of North York, and the commuter parking lot opened in July 2005. It was the northwestern terminus of the line for over two decades, until the opening of the Toronto–York Spadina subway extension on December 17, 2017.

When this station opened, it was among the first accessible stations of the Toronto subway system, and the first to be purpose-built as such. The station also features Wi-Fi service.

==History==
Sheppard West station (then named &quot;Downsview&quot;) was opened in 1996 as a one-stop extension north of Wilson station. The reason for such a short extension was that the provincial government was offering funds for subway expansion as part of the Network 2011 plan, but was debating whether an extension should curve east to interline with a future phase of the proposed Sheppard Line (which was only approved with a western terminus at the-then Sheppard station on the Yonge line), or continue farther north as part of a loop to join the Spadina and Yonge line branches, either along the hydro corridor north of Finch Avenue or along Steeles Avenue via York University. The Sheppard line interlining idea was dropped in favour of the loop proposalitself superseded in 2002 by the Vaughan extension plan, which was ultimately what was built. As a northward extension was chosen as part of the intervening loop plans, the short extension was built with the station constructed on a north–south alignment.

Construction of an access track to Wilson Yard branching off the mainline south of station began in 2009 but was mothballed after a tunnel was completed in 2010. Track was not laid and the tunnel was sealed off with hoarding. However, the tunnel was put into service in 2018 after completion of an ongoing expansion project to expand the Wilson Yard.

Concurrent with the opening of the extension on December 17, 2017, this station became one of the first eight stations to discontinue sales of legacy TTC fare media (tokens and tickets), previously available at the fare collector booth. Presto vending machines were available to sell Presto cards and to load funds onto them. On May 3, 2019, this station became one of the first ten stations to sell Presto tickets via Presto vending machines.

==Name==

Originally, the TTC named the station &quot;Downsview&quot; due to its intended role as a transfer point for Line 4 Sheppard, which was planned to extend westward beyond Yonge Street and intersect with the western segment of Line 1. &quot;Downsview&quot; was the winning entry in a public naming competition. Another name considered was &quot;Wilson Heights&quot;.

On May 7, 2017, the station was renamed &quot;Sheppard West&quot; in preparation for the opening of Downsview Park station that same year. The TTC felt the name &quot;Downsview&quot; would mislead passengers into thinking Downsview Park was easily accessible from the station, when in actuality, the upcoming northern station would offer a more direct connection to the park. The renaming cost $800,000, which was largely spent on updating the Toronto Rocket subway trains&#x27; automated announcement system and destination signs.

Prior to the renaming, Downsview was the only station in the system to have its name displayed in mixed-case lettering on the platform walls. The new name is rendered in uppercase lettering, using the traditional Toronto Subway typeface, on placards that obscure the old name. Smaller text at the bottom acknowledges the station&#x27;s previous name.

==Architecture and art==
The station was designed by Adamson Associates Architects (above grade buildings and mezzanine) and The Stevens Group Architects (below grade). The subway platform lacks pillars and the ceiling is high and curved, evoking an aircraft hangar. High ceilings, skylights and an exceptionally large mezzanine make the station feel open and airy. Natural light reaches all areas of the station including the subway platform. The offset, glassed-in access walkway above the platform overlooks it and gives passengers views of passing trains below. Originally, the walkway was divided by a sinuous barrier as it ran through both the fare-paid and unpaid areas, with the unpaid half leading from an entrance at the north end of the station to the main fare concourse. The barrier was removed after this entrance had Presto card paddle fare gates installed in 2017. As a result, the north side entrance to the station is now a fully automated entrance and is only accessible to those using Presto.

The station features two pieces of artwork:
* &quot;Sliding Pi&quot; is a large scale wall mosaic by Calgary artist Arlene Stamp. It can be viewed when travelling between the bus platform and the mezzanine level. The work shows colourful overlapping rectangles with the amount of overlap mathematically determined by the digits in the number pi. The overlapping pattern is non-repeating and gives the impression to viewers that the rectangles are sliding to one side.
* &quot;Boney Bus&quot;, created by John McKinnon in 2000, is located in front of the station and consists of an abstract bus shape made from aluminum beams with basalt &quot;wheels&quot;.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include Downsview Park, which was the site of the World Youth Day Papal Visit in 2002 and the SARSstock concert in 2003. It is the site of an airstrip once used by a military base (CFB Toronto), and by an aircraft manufacturer (DeHavilland), separating the station area from the original village of Downsview. William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute lies to the northeast in the Bathurst Manor neighbourhood.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

The subway platform is located underground east of Allen Road. There is a complex crossover just south of the station, which incorporates a switch to a single track which branches off to the west in a tunnel to access Wilson Yard. The line continues underground for and crosses to the west side of the road; after exiting at the Clanton Park Portal, the line runs on the surface past Wilson Yard and passes the original north access track to it. South of this point, the line partially uses what were originally the non-revenue yard access tracks north of Wilson, the previous terminal station. North of the station, the line turns sharply northwest to cross under Allen Road again, then leaves Allen Road&#x27;s alignment and heads via a compound curve toward Downsview Park station. Immediately north of the station, there is a trackless third tunnel between the service tunnels, built when the station was a terminus to accommodate a potential third tail track, but which may now be used to house a potential pocket track. 
==Surface connections==

Several TTC routes serve the station, as does one York Region Transit (YRT) route. For YRT bus riders, disembarking is done on-street outside the station as an additional fare is requiredfor cash paymentswhen transferring between the TTC and YRT. 

==Proposed Line 4 extension==
The original plans for Line 4 Sheppard called for it to terminate at this station (then Downsview) and connect there with Line 1, but during construction in the late 1990s, the extension of Line 4 was halted after the first phase due to funding issues. Plans to extend Line 4 are currently inactive, but some local politicians (such as former Toronto mayor Rob Ford) have tried to revive the Line 4 expansion. In 2023, Metrolinx began public consultations for a potential extension of Line 4 east towards Scarborough and west towards Sheppard West station.

<text>Wilson is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the median of Allen Road at Wilson Avenue. The station is accessible, has commuter parkingincluding bike parkingand connects to many bus routes.

==History==
Wilson station was opened in what was then the Borough of North York as the last station in the 1978 subway line extension north from St. George station. According to historian Mike Filey, Wilson Avenue is a misspelling of Arthur L. Willson, who was a clerk and treasurer of York Township for over twelve years around 1875. Among Arthur Willson&#x27;s accomplishments were writing a &quot;municipal manual&quot;, &quot;which has been found of practical value as a guide to those requiring a knowledge of municipal law&quot;, according to a history of the County of York.

Wilson was the northwestern terminus of the Yonge–University line for eighteen years and a major hub for TTC bus service, but with the extension to (then named &quot;Downsview&quot;) in 1996, many of the bus routes serving areas to the north were moved to the new station.

Concurrent with the opening of the Toronto–York Spadina Subway Extension (TYSSE) on 17 December 2017, this station became one of the first eight stations to discontinue sales of legacy TTC fare media (tokens and tickets), previously available at a fare collector booth. Presto vending machines were available to sell Presto cards and to load funds onto them. On 3 May 2019, this station became one of the first ten stations to sell Presto tickets via Presto vending machines.

In November 2018, construction began on three new elevators, automatic sliding doors, and a new accessible washroom, to make the station wheelchair accessible. It was completed on 18 December 2020.

By the late 1990s, over 2,000 commuter parking spaces were available. Two lots were declared surplus in 2013 and have been redeveloped. Until November 2024, 953 parking spaces remained at Wilson; however, in October 2021, the city government reached an agreement with developer Tridel to build 1,484 new homes, a childcare centre and a new park on the main parking lot. Since 18 November 2024, only the Wilson Transit Road Lot with 72 spaces remains available. Following the opening of the subway extension into York Region in 2017, new commuter parking lots are available farther north at stations like Highway 407 and Pioneer Village.

==Architecture and art==
Wilson is one of two Yonge–University line stations on the west side of the line, along with , that were designed by the TTC&#x27;s in-house architects.

The subway station building is a simple enclosed concrete structure built within the median of Allen Road where it crosses over Wilson Avenue. The mezzanine level connects by a maze of tunnels to the bus terminal, a kiss-and-ride facility and four commuter parking lots with a total of 2257 spaces. An additional island bus platform, no longer needed for the reduced number of connecting buses after the line was extended to Sheppard West Station, was mothballed and now serves as a storage area.

Wilson station is home to multiple art displays. A wall sculpture by Ted Bieler entitled &quot;Canyons&quot; is located at the mezzanine level. In late 2019, &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; was installed in multiple parts of the station. The display can be found in various locations, such as the subway platform level, walkway to bus bays, and on the second floor of the bus bays.

In October 2021, a mural named &quot;Daily Migration&quot; was unveiled. The mural is located on a wall of an entrance south of the station, west of Allen Road.
==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

Northwest of the station is the Wilson Yard, opened in 1977, which houses the system&#x27;s largest subway marshalling yard having taken over Yonge-University line operations from Davisville Yard in 1993 and a large bus garage servicing most of the bus routes in north Toronto. The original yard access tracks form part of the mainline north to station, crossing under the southbound lanes of Allen Road and descending, as does the road itself, down to ground level. There is a diamond crossover south of the station, used to reverse trains when the station was a terminus, and still frequently used for short turning.
==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include a Costco store and the southern end of Downsview Park. Across Highway 401 is Yorkdale Shopping Centre. Large events at the park, such as World Youth Day 2002 and Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto in 2003, have resulted in heavy use of Wilson station.

<doc id="1304053" wikidata="Q6675048" url="?curid=1304053" title="Look People">
<text>Look People was a Canadian alternative rock band formed in 1985 in Toronto. They were known as &quot;outlandishly quirky&quot;, and had a moderate hit in 1991 with a cover of War&#x27;s &quot;Lowrider&quot;. They received five CASBY Award nominations for their CD &quot;Small Fish, Big Pond&quot;.

==History==
The band formed in 1985 around the lineup of vocalist Jaymz Bee, guitarist Andy Flinn, bassist Walter K. Thut, drummer Mike Weilenmann and percussionist Gerry Scott, aka Great Bob Scott. Flinn left the band and was replaced by Fabio Marc Baltensperger; he left and was replaced by Longo Hai. Weilenmann quit before their first recording, leaving Great Bob Scott to fill the chair as drummer and percussionist.

In 1986, Look People released the EP &quot;Stop Making Cheese&quot;, which was recorded in Switzerland and released in North America on AMOK Records.

By 1988, the band was down to Bee and Scott, who composed music with producer Walter Zweifel and played several shows with John Bottomley and Chris Bottomley. The following year, a new lineup formed, consisting of Bee, Scott, Clay Tyson, Kevin Hearn, Bazl Salazar and &quot;Aardvark Q. Dardknarbles&quot; (Derek Orford). This lineup (with Richard Underhill on sax)), recorded the band&#x27;s 1989 EP &quot;More Songs About Hats and Chickens&quot;. Salazar and Dardknarbles then left the band, and guitarist Longo Hai returned.

In 1990, Look People released their debut album, &quot;Small Fish, Big Pond&quot; (which includes an appearance by Bob Wiseman).

In 1991, Hypnotic Records released the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Boogazm&quot;. Look People then toured Europe, played a couple of Lollapalooza dates, and toured Canada twice. Tyson then left the band and was replaced by Chris Gartner. 

In 1993, Look People released their third album, &quot;Crazy Eggs&quot;, and became the house band for the CBC Television variety show &quot;Friday Night with Ralph Benmergui&quot;. Following the cancellation of that series, Look People made one final tour of North America and performed their last show at the Palomino Club (North Hollywood), with an opening act of rock music performed by porn stars Madison Ivy, Raven, and Ron Jeremy. 

Bee pursued lounge music, forming Jaymz Bee and the Royal Jelly Orchestra. Kevin Hearn, Great Bob Scott, Derek Orford, and Chris Gartner continued working together as Thin Buckle. Jaymz Bee and Great Bob Scott continued to collaborate on music in the bands &quot;Bonzai Suzuki&quot; and &quot;The Tiki Collective&quot;. There have been reunion concerts; the band played a show at the 2013 Electric Eclectics Festival In 2019, Derek Orford became ill and the band played a fundraising concert for him at The Dakota Tavern.

<doc id="1304057" wikidata="Q586583" url="?curid=1304057" title="Yorkdale station">
<text>Yorkdale is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the median of the William R. Allen Road just south of Highway 401. Opened in 1978, the station is named after the nearby Yorkdale Shopping Centre, to which it is connected by an enclosed walkway.

Connections to GO Transit and Ontario Northland intercity buses are available at Yorkdale Bus Terminal, immediately west of the station.

==Entrances==
* Yorkdale Mall west entrance, next to Yorkdale Bus Terminal
* Ranee Avenue and Allen Road, south entrance (unstaffed entrance)
* Onramp to Highway 401 and Allen Road, north entrance

==Architecture and art==
Yorkdale was designed by Arthur Erickson. The station is above ground, and also above street level. It has two tracks: northbound and southbound, and has a centre platform. A dramatic vaulted glass roof spans the length of the single centre platform. It terminates symmetrically at escalators and stairs at both ends of the platform, creating the appearance of a glass dome. The interior walls of the station at platform level are unfinished concrete, but artistically cast, and curve over the tracks to form the ceiling. The shape of the windows on these walls recalls the oval windows of subway trains. On the exterior, these concrete walls are clad with stainless steel.

Handrails on stairs leading to the platform are backlit. Platform shelters are unique to the station, designed in the oval shape which dominates many features in the station, with large windows. Like the centre pillars which hold X-shaped structural supports—distinctive in Toronto&#x27;s rapid transit system to the station—they are clad in unpainted metal panels.

Yorkdale station won a Governor General&#x27;s Award for Architecture in 1982.

The station&#x27;s glass roof originally featured an artwork by Michael Hayden—also responsible for the &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; installation at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport—called &quot;Arc en ciel&quot; (French for &quot;rainbow&quot;). This piece consisted of a large number of mercury-vapour lamps painted in various colours that would light in a pattern, running along the station in the appropriate direction whenever a train went through. In the mid-1990s, it stopped working because of damaged transformers caused by water leakage. Each transformer would have cost just $28 to repair at the time; however, because the TTC had not budgeted for its continued maintenance, it was removed at the artist&#x27;s request.

At a TTC meeting in September 2010, a deal was made for Oxford Properties, owner of Yorkdale Mall which connects to the station, to pay for the restoration of the installation. The plan calls for the rebuilt piece to use LED lights, allowing for a broader range and customization of colours and patterns. Hayden requested that a maintenance contract be included, and for the piece installed by a Toronto-based company. The cost of such a reinstallation was not known (the original installation cost $100,000) until 13 July 2016, when it was revealed that the Oxford Properties would pay for much of the $500,000 cost to re-install the art installation, with some of the funds being from a pool dedicated to community improvements.

==History==
In late 2013, the entrance at Ranee Avenue was altered: the south and north driveways were removed, and curb was added to run parallel with the support pillars. Buses no longer drop passengers off directly at the doors. This project was completed in conjunction with resurfacing of Ranee to remove asbestos and the future construction of residential buildings along Allen Road on the south side of Ranee.

In January 2014, the parking structure connected to the subway, which could accommodate 1144 cars, was demolished for mall expansion. Construction of a new parking structure was delayed to coincide with the opening of Nordstrom and eventually opened in February 2017, with 1,010 spaces.

On 6 January 2019, this station discontinued sales of legacy TTC fare media (tokens and tickets), previously available at a fare collector booth. Presto vending machines were available to sell Presto cards and to load funds or a monthly Metropass onto them.

On 5 April 2019, and Yorkdale stations became the first two locations to sell single-use Presto tickets, which are sold from the stations&#x27; Presto fare vending machines.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
South of Yorkdale station, Allen Road descends into a shallow open cut below the surrounding ground level, and the subway descends with it until Eglinton West station. North of Yorkdale, the tracks remain elevated and cross Highway 401 to Wilson station.

== Surface connections ==
=== Toronto Transit Commission ===

A transfer is required to connect between the subway and surface bus routes.

TTC routes serving the station include:
==In popular culture==

Yorkdale station was used as the Transit Hub station in the film &quot;The Last Chase&quot; (1981) because of its futuristic look. The station also appears in both &quot;Scanners&quot; (1981) and &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; (1983).

<text>MusiCAD is a scorewriter program originally designed for folk music featuring irregular meter (like or ) and automatically generated accompaniment voices (bass/chords) from chord symbols and specified time signature. Created lead sheets are audibly verifiable. One of its design goals was to be as predictable as possible: &#x27;what-you-write-is-what-you&#x27;ll-hear&#x27;. The resulting music engraving is the result of the notes used and an applied set of rules (note sizes etc.) that determine how notes should be drawn. After changing the layout parameters or after transpose the (new) rules are applied, perhaps changing page layout completely.

The name MusiCAD is a portmanteau of music and computer-aided design.

The DOS/XT and Dutch-only 1.65 version has been available since 1994. Version 2.0 added support for multi-voice score editing. Later versions do not focus that much on folk music anymore and will allow up to 32 voices as well as percussion notation. The 3.0 version is available for Microsoft Windows and in Dutch, English and German. Like a few other scorewriters, it uses plain ASCII files for storage. MusiCAD will read and write ABC-notation as well as MIDI, and is capable of writing PDF-files for easy distribution of scores. There is an unlimited-time evaluation mode which allows storing and printing. Version 4 adds (among others) UTF-8, MusicXML import/export.

<doc id="1304065" wikidata="Q2113908" url="?curid=1304065" title="Providence Equity">
<text>Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. is a specialist private equity investment firm focused on media, communications, education, and technology investments across North America and Europe. The firm specializes in growth-oriented private equity investments and has invested in more than 170 companies globally since its inception in 1989.

The firm manages funds with over $31 billion in aggregate private equity capital commitments, making it a large global player in the private equity industry. Providence was one of the principal pioneers of a sector-based approach to private equity investing. The firm&#x27;s eighth fund, Providence Equity Partners VIII, closed on $6 billion in 2019, above its $5 billion target. The prior fund, Providence VII, closed with $5 billion in 2013.

Providence is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island with additional offices in New York, Boston, London and Atlanta.

==Operations==
The firm raises investment funds from a broad array of institutional investors, including pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, financial institutions, insurance companies, fund of funds, and high-net-worth individuals.

Providence partners with companies at various stages of development, from growth capital and complex recapitalizations of family-owned businesses to large buyouts and take-privates. The firm targets equity investments of $150 million to $500 million and can employ a variety of financing structures. Providence prefers to lead its investments, serve on company boards, and work collaboratively with company management.

== History ==
In 2008, Providence hired Thomas Gahan as president of the firm&#x27;s new capital markets group and its affiliate, Benefit Street Partners. Prior to joining Providence, Gahan was head of Deutsche Bank&#x27;s corporate and investment banking in the Americas and chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities. Benefit Street Partners closed on a $1.75 billion middle market direct lending fund in April 2014. The credit platform was sold to Franklin Templeton Investments in October 2018.

In 2014, Providence established Providence Strategic Growth (PSG), its growth equity affiliate focused on investments in lower middle market software and technology-enabled service companies. PSG is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, with offices in London and Kansas City.

Providence&#x27;s investments have included AutoTrader.com Group, Blackboard Inc., Conversica, eircom, Hulu, Kabel Deutschland, MLS Media, NEW Asurion, Bluestone Television, Newport Television, Univision, VoiceStream (now T-Mobile US), Warner Music Group, Western Wireless, and World Triathlon Corporation (Ironman), YES Network and TopGolf.

In March 2013, Providence and the National Football League formed a global partnership to invest primarily in sports and entertainment related media assets.

In September 2012, Providence sold a less than 10% stake in the firm to Florida&#x27;s state pension system and a sovereign wealth fund.

In February 2015, Providence&#x27;s $800 million stake in security screener Altegrity was wiped out when the security company was accused of fraud and filed for bankruptcy. This followed a series of other expensive losses that Providence blamed on investments outside of its expertise made during the peak of the 2007 and 2008 private equity boom.

In February 2017, Providence expanded its education business by buying NACE Schools, a Spain-based operator of for-profit schools. , the schools portfolio branded as Globeducate has 55 schools in nine countries.

In October 2017, Modern Times Group sold its telecommunication businesses in the Baltic states to Providence Equity Partners. The newly acquired companies were united and operate under the All Media Baltics company name (currently TV3 Group).

In April 2019, MasMovil agreed to repurchase its convertible bond from Providence Equity. Providence remains a shareholder in the company.

In September 2019, Providence Strategic Growth collected $2 billion for its fourth fund.

In August 2021, it was announced that Providence Equity had purchased a majority share of Sweetwater Sound, a major musical equipment retailer based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

In April 2022, it was announced Providence had acquired the cloud-based managed Wi-Fi solutions provider, Airties.

== Key people ==
In September 2020, Providence announced a leadership transition plan, under which founder and CEO Jonathan M. Nelson would become Executive Chairman in January 2021. As part of this planned transition, Providence appointed Davis Noell and David Phillips senior managing directors and co-heads of North America, and Karim Tabet and Andrew Tisdale senior managing directors and co-heads of Europe. Managing Director Michael Dominguez was appointed Chief Investment Officer.

<doc id="1304071" wikidata="Q1041636" url="?curid=1304071" title="Lawrence West station">
<text>Lawrence West is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the median of William R. Allen Road at Lawrence Avenue West. The station serves the local communities of Lawrence Heights, Lawrence Manor and Glen Park, and nearby destinations such as the Columbus Centre, Lawrence Heights Community Recreation Centre and Lawrence Allen Centre. The station has a Gateway Newstands in the north end concourse area at street level.

==History==

The station opened in 1978, as part of the subway line extension from to Wilson station.

In 2008, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported this station, along with Lansdowne, Kennedy, and Warden to be a &quot;known problem area&quot; in terms of crime in the subway system.

In 2014, an elevator, automatic sliding doors and an accessible fare gate were installed in the main part of the station on the south side of Lawrence Avenue, to make the station wheelchair accessible. In addition, repairs were made to the sawtooth bus platforms and the roadway was repaved for low floor buses. The northside entrance remains inaccessible due to space restrictions and generally used as drop off point by car.

On 6 January 2019, this station discontinued sales of legacy TTC fare media (tokens and tickets), previously available at a fare collector booth. Presto vending machines were available to sell Presto cards and to load funds or a monthly Metropass onto them.

On 5 April 2019, Lawrence West and stations became the first two locations to sell single-use Presto tickets, which are sold from the stations&#x27; Presto fare vending machines.

==Architecture and art==
Dunlop Farrow Aitken was the firm responsible for the station&#x27;s architecture. The structure is composed of an enclosed train platform area in the median of Allen Road, which is bridged by a bus loop and waiting area on the south side of the Lawrence Avenue bridge. Staffed entrances on both sides of the street connect to a transfer area which links the train platform and the bus area.

Upon entrance from the Lawrence Avenue bridge over Allen Road, the bus waiting area and the train platform are apparent. This openness is achieved through glazed walls and a large stairwell. The glass is framed with distinctive orange-painted metal. The platform level features exposed concrete walls, with a long strip of skylights above the tracks with the same orange framing used throughout the station. Rectangular prism benches with rectangular tiles of yellow, orange, and brown hues are unique to the station. Similar tiles are used on the floors and centre pillars.

&quot;Spacing... Aerial Highways&quot;, a large 300 foot ceramic tile mural designed by Claude Breeze, spreads across the north face of the main station building above the bus platform.

== Surface connections ==
When the subway is closed, buses use stops outside of the terminal along Lawrence Avenue West. TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1304072" wikidata="Q214563" url="?curid=1304072" title="Edward Salomon">
<text>Edward Salomon (August 11, 1828April 21, 1909) was a Jewish American politician and the 8th governor of Wisconsin, having ascended to office from the lieutenant governorship after the accidental drowning of his predecessor, Louis P. Harvey. He was the first Jewish governor of Wisconsin.

==Early life==
Salomon was born in Ströbeck, in the Province of Saxony, in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia. He was the son of Dorothea (Klussman) and Christoph Salomon. He attended the University of Berlin, but as a sympathizer with the contemporary German revolution, fled the country in 1849. He immigrated to the United States and settled in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where he was a schoolteacher, a surveyor, and served as deputy circuit court clerk. In 1852 he moved to Milwaukee, where he read law, was admitted to the bar in 1855, and set up a law practice with Winfield Smith. Salomon was Jewish and a cousin of Edward S. Salomon, the future governor of the Washington Territory who was considered to be one of the highest-ranking Jewish heroes in the American Civil War.

==Career==
In 1860, to support Abraham Lincoln for the presidency, Salomon changed his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican. In 1861 he was nominated by the Republican Party on their Union Party ticket as candidate for lieutenant governor. He ultimately won the election by a narrow margin. In 1862, when Governor Louis P. Harvey drowned, Salomon became Wisconsin&#x27;s first German-born and first Jewish governor.

In 1862 Governor Salomon responded to a request from the War Department for more troops by asking for volunteers and setting up a draft. He was able to raise 14 regiments. Salomon had to call up federal troops to quell the Port Washington Draft Riot. Suppression of the rioters with use of federal troops cost him the 1864 Republican nomination.

In 1864, Salomon resumed his law practice in Milwaukee. In 1869 he moved to New York City, where he continued his law practice for a number of years as legal representative for various important German interests. When he retired in 1894, he returned to Germany and lived there until his death.

==Death==
Salomon died April 21, 1909, in Germany at Frankfurt am Main. He was buried at Frankfurt&#x27;s Old Jewish Cemetery.

==Family==
Salomon married a woman named Elise Nebel. He had three brothers, Charles Eberhard Salomon, Frederich Salomon, and Herman Salomon, all of whom were involved in the American Civil War.

Salomon&#x27;s brothers, Frederick Salomon and Charles Eberhard Salomon, served as officers in the Union Army. On July 18, 1862, Frederick was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as a brigadier general of volunteers to rank from July 16, 1862. President Lincoln submitted the nomination to the U.S. Senate on May 17, 1862, and the Senate confirmed the appointment on July 16, 1862. Charles served as colonel of the 5th Missouri Volunteer Infantry (3 months, 1861) and on September 26, 1862, rejoined the army and succeeded Frederick as colonel of the 9th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. On March 13, 1865, his cousin Edward S. Salomon was made a brigadier general for his &quot;distinguished gallantry and meritorious service.&quot; On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Charles Eberhard Salomon for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.

<doc id="1304075" wikidata="Q1041497" url="?curid=1304075" title="Glencairn station">
<text>Glencairn is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the median of William R. Allen Road at Glencairn Avenue.

==History==
The station opened in 1978 in what was then the Borough of North York. It was part of the subway line extension from St. George to Wilson station.

A station at Glencairn and Yonge was considered for the North Yonge extension in the late 1960s and early 1970s. However, this was dropped (along with Glen Echo Station at Yonge Boulevard) because of budgetary concerns. If built, it would have been placed between Eglinton and Lawrence stations on the Yonge line.

==Station description==
Glencairn station was constructed at ground level within the median of Allen Road, between the Glencairn Avenue and Viewmount Avenue bridges.

Glencairn Avenue, at the north end of the station, has entrances on the north and south side of the street. Here there are both up and down escalators and stairs between the centre train platform, the intermediate concourse where there is a collectors booth and turnstiles, and street level. Viewmount Avenue, at the south end of the station, only has stairs to an automatic entrance on the north side of the street.

As part of the Easier Access program, construction began in 2022 to add elevators to the centre platform, which connects to the street-level concourse. The project was completed on October 1, 2024.

==Architecture and art==

Glencairn was designed by Adamson Associates. A central vaulted glass roof spans the length of the station, allowing the penetration of natural light to all areas of the station during the day and to be seen at night as a long illuminated strip of light.

The glass roof is directly above the single centre platform. This is similarly to Yorkdale station, where the interior walls of the station at platform level are unfinished concrete, with curved sections over the tracks to form a lower ceiling. Unlike Yorkdale, the curve is less sudden making the walls more rounded in appearance and they are clad with white horizontal panels between vertical concrete &quot;ribs&quot;, along with a wider orange panel strip displaying the station name. Platform level seating is sheltered within glass walls. Wayfinding signage is backlit. Floors and some of the walls are clad with red-brown tiles.

Glencairn features an artistic skylight entitled &quot;Joy&quot; designed by Rita Letendre. It existed in two versions, both by the same artist. The first version was installed in 1977 and consisted of painted translucent glazed act panels; it was removed in the early 1990s at the artist&#x27;s request after leakage damaged the art panels below the skylight, and was replaced with a lighter weight-supported glazing system. The second version, installed in 2020, is a reinterpretation of the original work. It consists of art colours inserted between two glass panels.

==Surface connections==
TTC routes serving the station include:
Transfers to buses occur at curbside stops outside this station. 109 Ranee runs along Marlee Avenue one block west of Glencairn station.

<doc id="1304081" wikidata="Q51651" url="?curid=1304081" title="Rhineland massacres">
<text>The Rhineland massacres, also known as the German Crusade of 1096 or &quot;Gzerot Tatnó&quot; (, &quot;Edicts of 4856&quot;), were a series of mass murders of Jews perpetrated by mobs of French and German Christians of the People&#x27;s Crusade in the year 1096 (4856 in the Hebrew calendar). These massacres are often seen as the first in a sequence of antisemitic events in Europe which culminated in the Holocaust.

Prominent leaders of crusaders involved in the massacres included Peter the Hermit and especially Count Emicho. As part of this persecution, the destruction of Jewish communities in Speyer, Worms and Mainz was noted as the &quot;Hurban Shum&quot; (Destruction of Shum). These were new persecutions of the Jews in which peasant crusaders from France and Germany attacked Jewish communities. A number of historians have referred to the violence as pogroms.

==Background==
Though no Crusades explicitly targeted Jews, the fervor for holy war sometimes turned into an outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Europe, even though both ecclesiastical and secular authorities condemned it. The focus on crucifixion story and violence against enemies of the Christian faith during the Crusades, as exemplified by the preaching of Pope Urban II in 1095-96 and Bernard of Clairvaux in 1146-47, needed little misconceptions to be translated into animosity towards Jews. In parts of France and Germany, Jews were perceived just as much of an enemy as Muslims: they were held responsible for the crucifixion, and they were more immediately visible than the distant Muslims. Many people wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight &quot;non-believers&quot; when there were already &quot;non-believers&quot; closer to home. 

It is also likely that the crusaders were motivated by their need for money. The Rhineland communities were relatively wealthy, both due to their isolation, and because they were not restricted as Catholics were against moneylending. Many crusaders had to go into debt in order to purchase weaponry and equipment for the expedition; as the Catholic Church strictly forbade usury, many crusaders inevitably found themselves indebted to Jewish moneylenders. Having armed themselves by assuming the debt, the crusaders rationalized the killing of Jews as an extension of their Catholic mission.

There had not been so broad a movement against Jews by Catholics since the seventh century&#x27;s mass expulsions and forced conversions. While there had been a number of regional persecutions of Jews by Catholics, such as the one in Metz in 888, a plot against Jews in Limoges in 992, a wave of anti-Jewish persecution by Christian millenarian movements (which believed that Jesus was immediately to descend from Heaven) in the year 1000, and the threat of expulsion from Trier in 1066; these are all viewed &quot;in the traditional terms of governmental outlawry rather than unbridled popular attacks.&quot; Also many movements against Jews (such as forced conversions by King Robert the Pious of France, Richard II, Duke of Normandy, and Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor around 1007–1012) had been suppressed by various popes and bishops. The passions that were aroused within the Catholic community by Pope Urban II&#x27;s call for the first crusade had moved the persecution of Jews into a new chapter in history where previous constraints no longer held.
A relevant perspective on the extent of the era&#x27;s antisemitism was recorded 40 years afterward by Jewish historian Solomon bar Simson. He stated that Godfrey of Bouillon swore:

Emperor Henry IV (after being notified of the pledge by Kalonymus Ben Meshullam, the Jewish leader in Mainz) issued an order prohibiting such an action. Godfrey claimed that he never really intended to kill Jews, but the community in Mainz and Cologne sent him a collected bribe of 500 silver marks.

Sigebert of Gembloux wrote that before &quot;a war in behalf of the Lord&quot; could be fought, it was essential that the Jews convert; those who resisted were &quot;deprived of their goods, massacred, and expelled from the cities.&quot;

The first outbreaks of violence occurred in France. According to a contemporary chronicle of events written by an anonymous author in Mainz:

Richard of Poitiers wrote that Jewish persecution was widespread in France at the beginning of the expeditions to the east. The anonymous chronicler of Mainz admired the Jews:

In June and July 1095, Jewish communities in the Rhineland (north of the main departure areas at Neuss, Wevelinghoven, Altenahr, Xanten and Moers) were attacked, but the leadership and membership of these crusader groups was not chronicled. Some Jews dispersed eastward to escape the persecution.

On top of the general Catholic suspicion of Jews at the time, when the thousands of French members of the People&#x27;s Crusade arrived at the Rhine, they had run out of provisions. To restock their supplies, they began to plunder Jewish food and property while attempting to force them to convert to Catholicism.
Not all crusaders who had run out of supplies resorted to murder; some, like Peter the Hermit, used extortion instead. While no sources claim he preached against the Jews, he carried a letter with him from the Jews of France to the community at Trier. The letter urged them to supply provisions to Peter and his men. The &quot;Solomon bar Simson Chronicle&quot; records that they were so terrified by Peter&#x27;s appearance at the gates that they readily agreed to supply his needs. Whatever Peter&#x27;s own position on the Jews was, men claiming to follow after him felt free to massacre Jews on their own initiative, to pillage their possessions. Sometimes Jews survived by being subjected to involuntary baptism, such as in Regensburg, where a crusading mob rounded up the Jewish community, forced them into the Danube, and performed a mass baptism. After the crusaders had left the region, these Jews returned to practicing Judaism.

According to David Nirenberg, the events of 1096 in the Rhineland &quot;occupy a significant place in modern Jewish historiography and are often presented as the first instance of an antisemitism that would henceforth never be forgotten and whose climax was the Holocaust.&quot;

==Folkmar and Gottschalk==
In the spring of 1096, a number of small bands of knights and peasants, inspired by the preaching of the Crusade, set off from various parts of France and Germany (Worms and Cologne). The crusade of the priest Folkmar, beginning in Saxony, persecuted Jews in Magdeburg and later, on May 30, 1096, in Prague in Bohemia. The Catholic Bishop Cosmas attempted to prevent forced conversions, and the entire Catholic hierarchy in Bohemia preached against such acts. Duke Bretislaus II was out of the country and the Catholic Church&#x27;s officials&#x27; protests were unable to stop the mob of crusaders.

The hierarchy of the Catholic Church as a whole condemned the persecution of the Jews in the regions affected (though their protests had little effect). Especially vocal were the parish priests (only one monk, named Gottschalk, is recorded as joining and encouraging the mob). Chronicler Hugo of Flavigny recorded how these religious appeals were ignored, writing:

In general, the crusader mobs did not fear any retribution, as the local courts did not have the jurisdiction to pursue them past their locality nor did they have the ability to identify and prosecute individuals out of the mob. The pleas of the clergy were ignored on similar grounds (no cases against individuals were brought forward for excommunication) and the mob believed that anyone preaching mercy to the Jews was doing so only because they had succumbed to Jewish bribery.

Gottschalk the monk went on to lead a crusade from the Rhineland and Lorraine into Hungary, occasionally attacking Jewish communities along the way. In late June 1096, the crusader mob of Gottschalk was welcomed by King Coloman of Hungary, but they soon began plundering the countryside and causing drunken disorder. The King then demanded they disarm. Once their weapons had been secured, the enraged Hungarians fell upon them and &quot;the whole plain was covered with corpses and blood.&quot;

The priest Folkmar and his Saxons also met a similar fate from the Hungarians when they began pillaging villages there because &quot;sedition was incited&quot;.

==Emicho==
The largest of these crusades, and the most involved in attacking Jews, was that led by Count Emicho. Setting off in the early summer of 1096, an army of around 10,000 men, women and children proceeded through the Rhine valley, towards the Main River and then to the Danube. Emicho was joined by William the Carpenter and Drogo of Nesle, among others from the Rhineland, eastern France, Lorraine, Flanders and even England.

Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, absent in southern Italy, ordered the Jews to be protected when he learned of Emicho&#x27;s intent. After some Jews were killed at Metz in May, John, Bishop of Speyer gave shelter to the Jewish inhabitants. Still, 12 Jews of Speyer were slain by crusaders on May 3. The Bishop of Worms also attempted to shelter Jews, but the crusaders broke into his episcopal palace and killed the Jews inside on May 18. At least 800 Jews were massacred in Worms when they refused Catholic baptism.

News of Emicho&#x27;s crusade spread quickly, and he was prevented from entering Mainz on May 25 by Bishop Ruthard. Emicho also took an offering of gold raised by the Jews of Mainz in hope to gain his favor and their safety. Bishop Ruthard tried to protect the Jews by hiding them in his lightly fortified palace. Nevertheless, Emicho did not prevent his followers from entering the city on May 27 and a massacre followed. Many among the Christian business class (the burghers) in Mainz, had working ties with Jews and gave them shelter from the mobs (as the burghers in Prague had done). The Mainz burghers joined with the militia of the bishop and the burgrave (the town&#x27;s military governor) in fighting off the first waves of crusaders. This stand had to be abandoned when crusaders continued to arrive in ever greater numbers, and the militia of the bishop together with the bishop himself fled and left the Jews to be slaughtered by the crusaders. Despite the example of the burghers, many ordinary citizens in Mainz and other the towns were caught up in the frenzy and joined in the persecution and pillaging. Mainz was the site of the greatest violence, with at least 1,100 Jews being killed by troops under Clarambaud and Thomas. Given the choice between flight, death, and conversion, some Jews opted for a desperate fourth alternative: active martyrdom, that is, killing their family and themselves. One man, named Isaac, was forcefully converted, but wracked with guilt, later killed his family and burned himself alive in his house. Another woman, Rachel, murdered her four children with her own hands so that they would not be kidnapped and &quot;raised in the way of error&quot; as Christians. Chronicler Solomon bar Simpson compared Rachel to the martyrdom of the woman and her seven sons in an attempt to make sense of her desperate act.

Eliezer ben Nathan, a Jewish chronicler at the times, paraphrased Habakkuk 1:6 and wrote of

On May 29 Emicho arrived at Cologne, where most Jews had already left or were hiding in Christian houses. In Cologne, other smaller bands of crusaders met Emicho, and they left with quite a lot of money taken from the Jews there. Emicho continued towards Hungary, soon joined by some Swabians. Coloman of Hungary refused to allow them through Hungary. Count Emicho and his warriors besieged Moson (or Wieselburg), on the Leitha. This led Coloman to prepare to flee into Russia, but the morale of the crusader mob began to fail, which inspired the Hungarians, and most of the mob was slaughtered or drowned in the river. Count Emicho and a few of the leaders escaped into Italy or back to their own homes. William the Carpenter and other survivors eventually joined Hugh of Vermandois and the main body of crusader knights. Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV overruled Church law and permitted forcibly converted Jews to return to Judaism.

==Later attacks on Jews==
Later in 1096, Godfrey of Bouillon also collected tribute from the Jews in Mainz and Cologne, and would have participated in pogroms himself if he had not been ordered by Henry IV not to do so. Saint Louis University Professor Thomas F. Madden, author of &quot;A Concise History of the Crusades&quot;, claims the Jewish defenders of Jerusalem retreated to their synagogue to &quot;prepare for death&quot; once the Crusaders had breached the outer walls of the city during the siege of 1099. The chronicle of Ibn al-Qalanisi mentions the building was set on fire while the Jews were still inside. The Crusaders were supposedly reported as hoisting up their shields and singing &quot;Christ We Adore Thee!&quot; while they circled the fiery complex.&quot; However, a contemporary Jewish letter written shortly after the siege does not mention the burning synagogue. But playing on the religious schism between the two sects of Judaism, Arabist S.D. Goitein speculates the reason the incident is missing from the letter is because it was written by Karaite Jews and the synagogue belonged to Rabbinic Jews.

Following the siege, Jews captured from the Dome of the Rock, along with native Christians, were made to clean the city of the slain. Tancred took some Jews as prisoners of war and deported them to Apuleia in southern Italy. Several of these Jews did not make it to their final destination as &quot;Many of them were [...] thrown into the sea or beheaded on the way.&quot; Numerous Jews and their holy books (including the Aleppo Codex) were held ransom by Raymond of Toulouse. The Karaite Jewish community of Ashkelon (Ascalon) reached out to their coreligionists in Alexandria to first pay for the holy books and then rescued pockets of Jews over several months. All that could be ransomed were liberated by the summer of 1100. The few who could not be rescued were either converted to Catholicism or murdered. The First Crusade ignited a long tradition of organized violence against Jews in European culture. Jewish money was also used in France for financing the Second Crusade; the Jews were also attacked in many instances, but not on the scale of the attacks of 1096. In England, the Third Crusade was the pretext for the expulsion of the Jews and the confiscation of their money. The two Shepherds&#x27; Crusades, in 1251 and 1320, also saw attacks on Jews in France; the second in 1320 also attacked and killed Jews in Aragon.

==Catholic Church response==

The massacre of the Rhineland Jews by the People&#x27;s Crusade and other associated persecutions were condemned by the leaders and officials of the Catholic Church. The Church and its members had previously carried out policies to protect the presence of Jews in Christian culture. For example, the twenty-five letters regarding the Jews of Pope Gregory I from the late sixth century became the primary texts for the canons, or Church laws, which were implanted to not only regulate Jewish life in Europe but also to protect it. These policies did have limits to them; the Jews were granted protection and the right to their faith if they did not threaten Christianity and remained entirely submissive to Christian rule. These regulations were enacted in a letter by Pope Alexander II in 1063. Their goal was to define the place of the Jews in Christian society. The Dispar nimirum of 1060, was the late eleventh-century papal policy concerning the Jews. It rejected acts of violence and punishments of the Jews, and it enforced the idea of protecting the Jews because they were not the enemy of the Christians. This papal policy aimed at creating a balance of privilege and restrictions on Jews so that the Christians did not see their presence as a threat. Sixty years after the Dispar nimirum, inspired by the atrocities of the First Crusade, the Sicut Judaeis was issued. It was a more detailed and organized text of the position of the papacy concerning the treatment of Jews. This text was enacted by Pope Calixtus II in 1120. It defined the limits of the Jews&#x27; eternal servitude and continued the reinforcement of the Jews&#x27; right to their faith.

The bishops of Mainz, Speyer, and Worms had attempted to protect the Jews of those towns within the walls of their palaces. In 1084 Rüdiger Huzmann (1073–1090), bishop of Speyer, established an area for the Jews to live, to protect them from potential violence. Rüdiger&#x27;s successor, Bishop John, continued the protection of Jews during the First Crusade. During the attack on Speyer, John saved many of the Jews, providing them protection in his castle. Bishop John had the hands of many attackers cut off. Archbishop Ruthard of Mainz tried to save the Jews by gathering them in his courtyard; this was unsuccessful as Emicho and his troops stormed the palace. Ruthard managed to save a small number of Jews by putting them on boats in the Rhine. The Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann III, sent many of the Jews to outlying villages, so that they would be safe from Crusaders. The archbishop of Trier was less effective; he favored protecting the Jews from violence, but during the attack on Trier, he hid and did not take any action to help them. Some bishops, like Archbishop Hartwig of Spanheim in Magdeburg, went as far as offering the Crusaders silver to spare the Jews.

After the First Crusade, there was a continued effort made by the popes to protect the Jews, so that violence that occurred in the Rhineland Valley would not reoccur. In 1272, Pope Gregory X stated that the Jews &quot;are not capable of harming Christians, nor do they know how to do so.&quot; Popes continually assured the Christian people that the Jews were not the enemy, but the Saracens were because they opposed Christianity, and Jews would only become the enemy if they challenged the religion. Following Gregory X&#x27;s lead, Pope Benedict XIII clearly stated to the Christian people how to treat the Jews. &quot;Jews are never to be burdened beyond the limits of the present constitution. [They are not] to be molested, to be offered in their persons, or to have their goods seized... [Rather, they are to be treated] humanely and with clemency...&quot; Benedict enforced the privileges given to the Jews by warning the Christians that their actions toward the Jewish people must not violate those given to them by the Church.

Fifty years later, when St. Bernard of Clairvaux was urging recruitment for the Second Crusade, he specifically criticized the attacks on Jews that had occurred in the First Crusade. Though Clairvaux considered the Jews to be &quot;personae non gratae&quot;, he condemned in his letters the crusaders&#x27; attacks on the Jews and ordered protection for Jewish communities. There is debate on Bernard&#x27;s exact motivations: he may have been disappointed that the People&#x27;s Crusade devoted so much time and resources to attacking the Jews of Western Europe while contributing almost nothing to the attempt to retake the Holy Land itself, the result being that Bernard was urging the knights to maintain focus on the goal of protecting Catholic interests in the Holy Land. It is equally possible that Bernard held the belief that forcibly converting the Jews was immoral or perceived that greed motivated the original Rhineland massacre: both sentiments are echoed in the canon of Albert of Aachen in his chronicle of the First Crusade. Albert of Aachen&#x27;s view was that the People&#x27;s Crusaders were uncontrollable semi-Catholicized country-folk (citing the &quot;goose incident,&quot; which Hebrew chronicles corroborate) who massacred hundreds of Jewish women and children and that the People&#x27;s Crusaders were themselves slaughtered by Turkish forces in Asia Minor.

==Jewish reactions==
Sigebert of Gembloux wrote that most of those Jews who converted before the crusader threat later returned to Judaism.

In some cases Jews chose to die as Jews rather than convert. The Hebrew chronicles portray the Rhineland Jews as martyrs who willingly sacrificed themselves in order to honour God and to preserve their own honour (to die for &quot;Kiddush Hashem)&quot;. The Rhineland Jews looked to historical precedents since Biblical times to justify their actions: the honourable suicide of Saul, the Maccabees revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the suicide pact at Masada, and the Bar Kochba revolt were seen as justifiable deaths in the face of a stronger enemy. Despite this, the suicidal and homicidal nature of the Rhineland Jews&#x27; actions largely separated the events of 1096 from previous incidents in Jewish history. While the events of Masada most closely parallel those of the Rhineland Massacres, it is important to note that the dramatic suicides of that event were often downplayed by Rabbinic scholars, even to the point of Masada&#x27;s total omission from some Rabbinic histories. 

The Biblical moment that was most commonly evoked by chroniclers of the Rhineland Massacres was the Binding of Isaac, to which several allusions appear throughout the major primary sources, the &quot;Mainz Anonymous&quot;, the &quot;Soloman bar Simson Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Eliezer bar Nathan Chronicle&quot; (though allusions to this moment persist beyond these sources, and even in to more modern interpretations). Although it was the most common Biblical reference, the details of the Binding of Isaac presented significant dissimilarities (alongside definite parallels) that put the actions of the Rhineland Jewry at odds with the Biblical narrative. While Isaac was spared from sacrifice by divine intervention, the Jews of the Rhineland committed their ritual suicide to its end. This influenced novel interpretations of the binding of Isaac. The &quot;Soloman bar Simson Chronicle&quot; interprets the sacrifice of the Rhineland Jews as a similar, though even greater expression of righteousness and piety than that of Abraham, a theme echoed throughout other chronicles of the events. Similarly, a preexisting alternative Midrashic reading of the Binding of Isaac claiming that Isaac truly was sacrificed gained a newfound popularity following the events of 1096.

Several 20th century Jewish authors have related the events of 1096 to an underlying theme of human sacrifice. Historian Israel Yuval understood these choices as a manifestation of a Messianic theology that was uniquely tied to medieval Jews living in the midst of Latin Christendom. This theology understood the Messiah&#x27;s coming as a time of vengeance against those who transgressed against God and the Jewish people, as well as a process that was sensitive to the blood of Jewish martyrs. Such ideas are alluded to in the &quot;Sefer Hasidim&quot;, a work of the twelfth century consisting of an amalgamation of Rabbinic teachings common to the era and the centuries immediately preceding it. Additionally relevant was a medieval Ashkenazi genealogical interpretation of Christians as descendants of the Biblical Esau (referred to as Edomites), over whom the Jews (the descendants of Jacob) would eventually succeed and gain dominion. Following from this, the events of 1096 presented an opportunity for the Rhineland Jews to ritually offer their deaths as an example of Christian transgression and spur the Messianic Age – an analysis supported by the frequent ritual tone and symbolism employed by Jewish chroniclers while describing the deaths, and their somewhat lesser interest for Jews who simply died by Christian hands directly. This included frequent descriptions of suicides occurring within synagogues (which were on occasion burning), and the shedding of blood on the Holy Ark. Despite this, somewhat more &quot;post hoc&quot; explanations provided by Medieval Jewish chroniclers also existed. Most often, the homicide of the Rhineland children was explained by the adage &quot;lest they dwell among the Gentiles; it is better that they die innocent and not guilty&quot;, meaning that it was better to kill Jewish children and prevent them from losing their religion than to allow them to die later as a non-Jew. The descriptions of Jewish parents killing their children was shocking to Christian ears, and may have served as fuel for later accusations of blood libel. This analysis of Yuval&#x27;s caused a stir among the scholarly community, and the journal &quot;Zion&quot; devoted a double issue to discussing Yuval&#x27;s thesis. A particularly scathing response was written by Ezra Fleischer, in which he examines of Yuval&#x27;s claims and responds to them. The article ends with the words &quot;It is the kind of article that would have been better if it had not been written than written, and if it had been written - it would have been better if it had not been printed, and if it had been printed - it would have been better if it had been forgotten as soon as possible&quot;. 

Historians have disagreed about whether there was a halakhic justification for the mass suicide during Rhineland massacres. Haym Soloveitchik states that the issue of voluntary martyrdom to avoid committing sins in halakhic literature is highly questionable, and acorrding to that the Poskim should have determined that &quot;all the martyrs [...] were not only not &quot;holy,&quot; but were &quot;self-killers,&quot; and murderers&quot;. Later, according to Soloveitchik, the rabbis, out of respect for the victims, had to justify these horrific acts &quot;with a few deft twists, a tenable, if not quite persuasive&quot; of the Halakha. In contrast, Avraham Grossman, Israel Ta-Shma and other researchers state that the suicides acted according to the Jewish law as it was known to them. According to them, Ashkenazi Poskim attributed halakhic importance to the legends that appear in the Talmud (Aggadah), many of which involve suicides in order to avoid committing sins. Therefore, the act of suicide during the Rhineland massacres was anchored in the halakhic perception of the Ashkenazim, and they acted according to Jewish tradition, as they perceived it. 

Prior to the Crusades, the Jews were divided among three major areas which were largely independent of one another. These were the Jews living in Islamic nations (still the majority), those in the Byzantine Empire and those in the Catholic West. With the persecutions that began around 1096, a new awareness of the entire people took hold across all of these groups, reuniting the three separate strands. 

In the late 19th century, Jewish historians used the episode as a demonstration of the need for Zionism (that is, for a new Jewish state).

<text>Eglinton West is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the median of Allen Road on the north side of Eglinton Avenue West. It will become an interchange station with the upcoming Line 5 Eglinton, at which point it will be renamed Cedarvale.

==History==
The station opened in 1978, as part of the Line 1 extension from to station.

Eglinton West had been planned to be an interchange station as part of the proposed Eglinton West line (not to be confused with the Eglinton Crosstown line). This was one of the three proposed subway lines in the Network 2011 Plan created in 1985 by the Toronto Transit Commission. The project was cancelled in 1995 after the election of a Progressive Conservative government led by Mike Harris. Afterwards, the small amount of tunnel that had been dug under the station was refilled.

Since October 2005, the station has been wheelchair-accessible.

In December 2012, commuter parking lots formerly located east and west of the station building on the north side of Eglinton Avenue were taken out of service, leaving no immediately adjacent parking. The lots were used as staging areas for the tunnel boring machines (TBMs) during the construction of Line 5 Eglinton. On the weekend of 18 and 19 April 2015, the TBMs Dennis and Lea were extracted from the east-side staging area and then transported on a heavy truck trailer to relaunch from the west-side staging area. The two staging areas will each be the location of a new station entrance.

==Description==
The station building is located on the north side of Eglinton Avenue West between the entry/exit ramps for Allen Road. The station currently has two levels: street level and the platform level for Line 1 trains. The station&#x27;s pedestrian entrance, the station concourse and a bus terminal are all located at street level. The bus terminal, located in a fare-paid area, surrounds the concourse area with bays on three of its four sides.

After the opening of Line 5 Eglinton in 2024, Eglinton West will have two more station entrances: one just east of the Allen Road entry ramp, and the other just west of the Allen Road exit ramp. The current entrances will be retained for direct access to the bus terminal for walk-in patrons not riding the subway or LRT, and the new entrances will all be on the north side of Eglinton Avenue. On the south side of Eglinton Avenue just west of Everden Road, there is a possibility of an emergency exit or a fourth entrance to be incorporated into some future private development.

The Line 5 tunnel and platform will pass under the Line 1 platforms. Above the Line 5 platform level, there will be a new underground concourse divided in two sections by a gap where the Line 1 tracks cross. Crossover tracks to reverse Line 5 trains will be located just east of the Line 5 platforms.

===Architecture===
The station was designed by Arthur Erickson and Clifford &amp; Lawrie. The main ticketing and concourse area at surface level is sheltered by an exposed concrete space frame supported by eight circular columns. The concrete ceiling is, in effect, a large slab, and overhangs the entrance. With a glass curtain wall, it appears to float. Inside, it is coffered throughout the station, with skylights in certain areas, allowing for increased penetration of natural light. Eglinton West makes use of sandblasted concrete and brick wall finishes extensively, distinguishing it from most stations on Line 1 and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, where tiles are predominant.
As the north end of the station is in Allen Road&#x27;s median, the Line 1 platform level is partly built at surface level. Designers took advantage of this and added windows at platform level. The northbound platform has regular windows, allowing for a view onto Allen Road, while windows on the opposite platform were frosted during construction of the aborted Eglinton West subway in 1994. This combination of window treatments allows transit riders to view cars speeding onto Allen Road&#x27;s northbound expressway lanes, while blocking views of cars stuck in traffic approaching Eglinton, where the expressway—originally planned to continue south to downtown—ends.

During July 2009, the TTC installed an $850,000 green roof over the northern end of the station to reduce maintenance costs, increase the lifespan to 40–50 years, reduce the heat island effect by lowering the temperature of the surrounding area by a few degrees, and to reduce runoff. The TTC had to repair the roof anyway, since it had been leaking since 2000. The plants atop the 835-square-metre roof are low-maintenance sedums. and stations are slated to have green roofs installed as well.

===Art===

The station&#x27;s artwork, on two enamel murals facing each other, is &quot;Summertime Streetcar&quot; by Gerald Zeldin, is a montage of PCC streetcars from differing perspectives. The artwork is two storeys high and is located in the appropriately high ceiling section of the platform level.

In future, as part of a program to install artworks at major interchange stations along Line 5 Eglinton, the station will feature the artwork &quot;Super Signals&quot; by Douglas Coupland consisting of aluminum panels with brightly coloured concentric circles against a background of black and white diagonal lines. The artwork is an exaggeration of traditional wayfinding graphics.

===Line 1 infrastructure in the vicinity===
South of the station, Line 1 continues underground below Everden Road to reach the Cedarvale Ravine, then continues southeast below the ravine. Moving northward, tracks continue on the surface, in the median of Allen Road.

<text>is a private university in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan

Founded in 1949, it is located in Sanbanchō, near the Imperial Palace in the Chiyoda City. It began as a sewing school opened by Otsuma Kotaka (1884–1970) in 1908. From this grew the Otsuma Girls&#x27; High School (1935) and the Otsuma Women&#x27;s Vocational School (1942).

Otsuma Kotaka (大妻コタカ) was a pioneer of traditional women&#x27;s education, emphasizing scientific training in homemaking skills. For almost twenty years the university specialized in home economics and became synonymous with the education of ‘good wives and wise mothers’ (良妻賢母, &quot;ryōsai-kenbo&quot;). An adjacent two-year junior college was established in 1950.

In 1967 the university expanded with establishment of a Faculty of Language and Literature and construction of a second campus in Sayamadai, Saitama. Two hitherto independent girls&#x27; middle and high schools (Otsuma Nakano and Otsuma Ranzan) were also affiliated. In 1990 a third campus and a fourth affiliated high school were opened in Tama, Tokyo.

Like many other women&#x27;s universities in Japan, Otsuma has faced the challenge of a rapidly changing job market for women. In the 70s and 80s the demand was for junior college graduates and for most of this period the Otsuma Junior College English Department was at the top of the national rankings.

The subsequent shift to a demand for four-year graduates has resulted in the retrenchment of the junior college and the creation of several new faculties, including Social Information Studies and Comparative Cultures. On December 26, 1975, Popular girl group, The Candies performed their concert at that location.

<doc id="1304089" wikidata="Q1041505" url="?curid=1304089" title="St. Clair West station">
<text>St. Clair West is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It spans the block north of St. Clair Avenue West to Heath Street, between Bathurst Street and Tweedsmuir Avenue. The station serves the local communities of Forest Hill South, Humewood, Bracondale Hill and Casa Loma.

The addition of automatic sliding doors, accessible fare gates, and elevators made the station fully accessible in 2017.

== History ==
This station was opened in 1978, as part of the subway line extension from St. George station to Wilson Station. Its south end was in the City of Toronto while its north end was in what was then the Borough of York.

The sports field of St. Michael&#x27;s College School is directly above the length of the station and a Loblaws supermarket is located over the entrance on the north side of St. Clair Avenue.

The 1995 Russell Hill subway incident occurred on August 11, 1995, between this station and Dupont station to the south on the southbound line.

On September 3, 2017, the new Flexity Outlook streetcars were introduced to the 512 St. Clair streetcar route. Because the new streetcars are twice the length of the older CLRV streetcars, the underground platform assignments for streetcars at St. Clair West station had to be changed. Previously, streetcars for both directions shared the west-side platform for arrivals and the north-side platform for departures, each able to accommodate two CLRV streetcars. Now the west-side platform handles arrivals and departures for one eastbound streetcar, and the north-side platform for one westbound streetcar.

The streetcar tracks in the station were replaced in 2024; power and structural upgrades were performed as part of the same project.

== Entrances ==
The station has three entrances:

* The main entrance is located at on the north side of St. Clair Avenue West, about east of Bathurst Street beside a Loblaws. It is the only accessible entrance. An elevator, escalators and stairs lead to the fare gate on the bus and streetcar level.
* Opposite the main entrance, on the south side of the street near Wells Hill Avenue, an entrance with escalators and stairs leads via tunnel to a fare gate on the south concourse level. 
* An unstaffed automatic entrance is located on Heath Street adjacent to Tichester Road just east of Bathurst Street. This entrance has an elevator from street level to the concourse level but not to the platform level.

== Architecture and art ==
St. Clair West, designed by the TTC&#x27;s in-house architects, is a colourful station featuring a wide variety of interior finishes such as ceramic tiles, brick and sculptural concrete surfaces. Backlit orange panels and an abstract tile pattern resembling a barcode at platform level distinguish the station from others in the system. The TTC built its first underground streetcar loop at this station circling an exceptionally spacious waiting area for connections to surface routes. Buskers often take advantage of the acoustics caused by the station&#x27;s open architecture. Wilson is the one other station on the line which, due to its complexity, the TTC chose to design themselves.

The abstract enamel mural &quot;Tempo&quot; by Gordon Rayner is on the mezzanine-level bridge crossing the tracks.

The station has a second artwork, &quot;The Commuters&quot; by Rhonda Weppler and Trevor Mahovsky, installed during the 2016/17 station renovations. The artwork consists of many bronze snails of about 50-centimetres in size clinging to the walls of a staircase leading from the bridge over the subway tracks to the streetcar/bus platform. The work was inspired by Pierre Berton’s book for children: &quot;The Secret World of Og&quot;.


== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
South of the station, the subway tunnel cuts southeast through the Nordheimer Ravine, where the emergency exit used in the Russell Hill accident is located, then continues in a bored tunnel south beneath Spadina Road and under Casa Loma to Dupont Station.

Also constructed by cut-and-cover north of the station, the tunnel runs northwest through the Cedarvale Ravine to Eglinton West Station.

==Connections==

These routes can be boarded in the underground loop:

To connect to these bus routes, passengers can walk outside the station to Bathurst Street:

<doc id="1304092" wikidata="Q71358" url="?curid=1304092" title="Helmut Gollwitzer">
<text>Helmut Gollwitzer (29 December 1908 – 17 October 1993) was a German Protestant (Lutheran) theologian and author.

Born in Pappenheim, Bavaria, Gollwitzer studied Protestant theology in Munich, Erlangen, Jena, and Bonn (1928–1932); he later completed a doctorate under Karl Barth in Basel (1937), writing on the understanding of the eucharist in Martin Luther and John Calvin.

During the period of the Nazi regime in Germany, Gollwitzer was a well-known member of the Confessing Church movement, which resisted the regime&#x27;s attempt to control the churches. He took over as the pastor of the congregation at Berlin-Dahlem after the arrest of Martin Niemöller.

During World War II, Gollwitzer served as a medic at the Eastern Front, and was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1949. He wrote a book about his experience of being a POW which became a bestseller in Germany in 1950 (&quot;Unwilling Journey: A Diary from Russia&quot;); the then President of West Germany, Theodor Heuss, called it &quot;a great historical document&quot;.

Gollwitzer was appointed professor of systematic theology at the University of Bonn (1950–1957), and then as professor of Protestant theology at the Free University of Berlin; he retired in 1975. He had been Karl Barth&#x27;s first choice as his successor in Basel, but the university authorities turned him down due to what they called &#x27;his unclear attitude to the Soviet Union&#x27;. Dr. W. Travis McMaken illustrates Gollwitzer&#x27;s role in the theology and politics of the twentieth century in his latest book, &quot;Our God Loves Justice: An Introduction to Helmut Gollwitzer&quot;. He explains Gollwitzer&#x27;s close relationship with Barth, and the socialist political ideas Gollwitzer held throughout his life.

Known as a close friend of Rudi Dutschke, whose wife studied with Gollwitzer, and a pastor to Ulrike Meinhof, he was prominently involved in the political debates ensuing in the late 1960s and 1970s. He was also a friend to student movements since his time as a professor. In the 1950s, one of his students at the University of Bonn, Paul Oestreicher, wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that Gollwitzer was a pastor at heart, being equally concerned with students&#x27; personal issues like a &quot;broken love affair&quot; as with matters such as &quot;the betrayal of Christian values&quot; in Bonn society. Gollwitzer was a pacifist and a well-known opponent of nuclear escalation during the 1950s to 1980s. He opposed United States engagement in Vietnam, in the arms race, and was a staunch critic of capitalism.

Gollwitzer died in Berlin on 17 October 1993.

<text>Jaymz Bee (born April 13, 1963) is a Canadian musician, writer, emcee and radio personality based in Toronto, Ontario.

==Early life==
Jaymz was raised in North Bay, Ontario. He was a founder of the Al Waxman Fan Club at Inglenook Community High School and of the punk band Bee People. &quot;Bee had a fixation on [Waxman]... &#x27;[W]e only dressed in black and yellow and we only sang songs about Al Waxman: about his dog, his movies, his life, anything we could think of. We ended up with an hour-long show, just about Al Waxman.&#x27;&quot;

==Early career==
In 1985, Bee and his drummer Bob Scott joined members of a defunct Swiss band to form the alternative rock band Look People and left for Switzerland. &quot;&#x27;[W]e were a weird band that shouldn’t even be able to sell a record, and we were getting huge tours opening for Los Lobos or Bob Geldof or Wishbone Ash or Uriah Heep in stadiums.&#x27;&quot; After three years he and Scott returned to Toronto. The duo recruited new members and continued to perform as Look People until April 1994.

In 1992, Bee became the musical director for &quot;Friday Night with Ralph Benmergui&quot; when Look People became its house band.

In 1994, Bee and Melleny Melody formed an independent label called &quot;Nepotism Records&quot;.

Bee formed &quot;Jaymz Bee and the Royal Jelly Orchestra&quot; and recorded the group&#x27;s first lounge music album in 1995.

==Recent career==
In 1997, Bee published the book &quot;Cocktail Parties for Dummies&quot;, and began hosting radio shows on Toronto&#x27;s CFRB and CFMJ. 

In 2002, Bee released a new album, produced by Dave Howard, &quot;Sub Urban&quot; by Jaymz Bee and the Deep Lounge Coalition and followed that with another Royal Jelly Orchestra release entitled &quot;Seriously Happy&quot; for Wychwood Productions. His last recording with the RJO was &quot;Toronto Launch Pad&quot;, recorded in 2006 for his own label, Timely Manor. For over a decade, Bee ran a PR firm called Bullhorn which turned into a personal monthly newsletter in 2016. Bee formed a pop group called Bonzai Suzuki with Dave Howard. Their self-titled debut was released in the summer of 2011 and their follow up recording called &quot;Everything Leads To Everything Else&quot;. He collaborated with Carlos Peron (ex member of the band Yello) on an electronic dance recording called &quot;Tuk&quot; and most recently (2017) began writing and recording The Tiki Collective - a surf jazz band led by guitarist Eric St-Laurent. In 2018, this group released their debut album &quot;Muse&quot;, which reached #17 on the Canadian campus radio jazz chart in December.

== Films ==
Bee appeared in &quot;Say Nothing&quot; (2001), &quot;Heatscore&quot; (2002), &quot;Dom&quot; (2004), and &quot;Five Course Meal&quot; (2018). 

In 2021, it was revealed that a documentary about Bee&#x27;s life (working title: Being Bee) is currently being produced. Collaborators on the project include the team at Retrontario and Joel Goldberg, notable for his work on Electric Circus and directing music videos for rapper Maestro.

In 2023, Bee directed three short films: &quot;Wild Music&quot;, &quot;Beat Speak&quot;, and &quot;Artists &amp; Aliens&quot;

In February 2024, he began directing his first full-length feature film

<text>Dupont is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Spadina Road at Dupont Street in The Annex neighbourhood of the city. 

== History ==
The station opened in 1978, as part of the &quot;Spadina&quot; extension of the subway line from to station.

The 1995 Russell Hill subway accident happened on August 11, 1995, when a train southbound from station rear-ended another stationary train just north of Dupont station. Three people were killed and 30 were taken to hospital with injuries, and this section of the subway line was shut down for five days. Subsequent investigations found that a combination of human error and a design flaw in a mechanical safety device caused the accident.

On June 1, 2006, at 9:30 a.m., as a train entered the station, a metal cover in the bottom of the last subway car came loose and wedged in the third rail. This filled the train with smoke, forcing the evacuation of the station and disrupting service for about an hour. The possibility that this incident may have resulted from sabotage by striking TTC personnel was discarded by the Toronto Police.

Three elevators and improved fare gates were constructed, to make the station accessible. An open house was held on September 24, 2015, to outline the work involved. The elevators opened on September 30, 2020.

== Architecture and art ==
Dupont Station was designed by Dunlop-Farrow Architects. The two entrances to the station, located at the northwest and southeast corners of Dupont Street and Spadina Road, take the form of glass &quot;bubbles&quot; with orange-painted metal frames covering the stairways and escalators. A motif of rounded surfaces and finishes is used, with the interior walls of the station being clad in small circular orange tiles and all corners curved. On the platforms unique built-in concrete benches are also rounded and covered with the same tiles as the walls and the use of large circular lighting fixtures throughout the station reinforces the theme. The overall effect of the interior&#x27;s rounded surfaces and colour scheme is of an earthly cavern.

The main artwork in the station consists of murals designed by James Sutherland, entitled &quot;Spadina Summer Under All Seasons&quot;. Using thousands of pieces of glass, colourful mosaics of flowers were created directly within the station&#x27;s tiling. Two large mosaics of a giant flower in cross-section face each other across the tracks, reaching upward to a mezzanine level lined with smaller flower mosaics. Sculptor Ron Baird designed massive circular interlocking doors which provide access to the electrical substation, which is nestled behind the northwest entrance.

In mid-2021, to celebrate the TTC&#x27;s 100th anniversary, a temporary art installation titled &quot;Yonge Subway Construction&quot; by John DeRinzy was put on display at the station. It was located at the subway platform levels and was removed in July 2022.

== Nearby landmarks ==
The station is located on the north side of The Annex neighbourhood. Nearby landmarks and destinations include Casa Loma, Spadina House, Casa Loma campus of George Brown College and the City of Toronto Archives.

== Surface connections ==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:

<text>PSNI Football Club is an intermediate Northern Irish football club that plays in the Mid-Ulster Football League Intermediate A division. The club is associated with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and its home ground is Newforge Lane in Belfast.

==History==
PSNI FC was founded in 1928 as RUC, derived from Royal Ulster Constabulary and changed its name in 2002, following the police service&#x27;s name change to the PSNI.

The club joined the Northern Amateur Football League in 1956 and became one of its leading clubs before being elevated to the Irish League B Division in 1975. The club stayed at this level until failing to gain a place in the reorganised and re-branded IFA Championship in 2008.

Although originally only serving members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland could play for the team, this rule is no longer in effect.

In February 2019, Will Horwood was appointed as PSNI FC manager. Six months later, in November 2019, Horwood appointed 20-year-old Rhys Hadden as the assistant manager.

In January 2020, Glenn Taggart was appointed manager of PSNI FC, with Hadden remaining as assistant manager.

In April 2023, the club finished bottom of the NIFL Premier Intermediate League and was due to drop into amateur league football for the first time since 1973. However the club retained their league status in a new, 14-team PIL, due to issues with finding an appropriate league, and the issues with Warrenpoint Town. The move encored a great deal of criticism due to the move lacking sporting integrity, effectively meaning the club could not be relegated.

The club would finish bottom of the NIFL Premier Intermediate League and be successfully relegated this time, dropping out of senior football for the first time since 1973.

<doc id="1304106" wikidata="Q840750" url="?curid=1304106" title="Arvicolinae">
<text>The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae (yielding the adjective &quot;microtine&quot;) or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae.

The Arvicolinae are the most populous group of Rodentia in the Northern Hemisphere. They often are found in fossil occlusions of bones cached by past predators such as owls and other birds of prey. Fossils of this group are often used for biostratigraphic dating of paleontological and archeological sites in North America and Europe.

== Description ==
The most convenient distinguishing feature of the Arvicolinae is the nature of their molar teeth, which have prismatic cusps in the shape of alternating triangles. These molars are an adaptation to a herbivorous diet in which the major food plants include a large proportion of abrasive materials such as phytoliths; the teeth get worn down by abrasion throughout the adult life of the animal and they grow continuously in compensation.

Arvicolinae are Holarctic in distribution and represent one of only a few major muroid radiations to reach the New World via Beringia. (The others are the three subfamilies of New World rats and mice.) Arvicolines do very well in the subnival zone beneath the winter snowpack, and persist throughout winter without needing to hibernate. They are also characterized by extreme fluctuations in population numbers.

Most arvicolines are small, furry, short-tailed voles or lemmings, but some, such as &quot;Ellobius&quot; and &quot;Hyperacrius&quot;, are well adapted to a fossorial lifestyle. Others, such as &quot;Ondatra&quot;, &quot;Neofiber&quot;, and &quot;Arvicola&quot;, have evolved larger body sizes and are associated with an aquatic lifestyle.

== Phylogeny ==
The phylogeny of the Arvicolinae has been studied using morphological and molecular characters. Markers for the molecular phylogeny of arvicolines included the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (&quot;cyb&quot;) gene 
and the exon 10 of the growth hormone receptor (&quot;ghr&quot;) nuclear gene. The comparison of the &quot;cyb&quot; and &quot;ghr&quot; phylogenetic results seems to indicate nuclear genes are useful for resolving relationships of recently evolved animals. As compared to mitochondrial genes, nuclear genes display several informative sites in third codon positions that evolve rapidly enough to accumulate synapomorphies, but slow enough to avoid evolutionary noise.
Of note, mitochondrial pseudogenes translocated within the nuclear genome complicate the assessment of the mitochondrial DNA orthology, but they can also be used as phylogenetic markers.
Sequencing complete mitochondrial genomes of voles may help to distinguish between authentic genes and pseudogenes.

The complementary phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular characters 
suggests:
* &quot;Ellobius&quot;, &quot;Prometheomys&quot;, and &quot;Lagurus&quot; are among the most basal arvicolines.
* &quot;Dicrostonyx&quot;, &quot;Phenacomys&quot;, and &quot;Arborimus&quot; may form a clade.
* Core arvicolines include four subclades:
** Lemmini: &quot;Synaptomys&quot;, &quot;Lemmus&quot;, &quot;Myopus&quot;
** Myodini: &quot;Eothenomys&quot;, &quot;Myodes&quot;
** Arvicolini: &quot;Arvicola&quot;
** Microtini: &quot;Alexandromys&quot;, &quot;Chionomys&quot;, &quot;Hyperacrius&quot;, &quot;Lasiopodomys&quot;, &quot;Lemmiscus&quot;, &quot;Microtus&quot;, &quot;Mictomicrotus&quot;, &quot;Neodon&quot;, &quot;Proedromys&quot;, &quot;Stenocranius&quot;, &quot;Volemys&quot;
* &quot;Ondatra&quot; and &quot;Dinaromys&quot; positions are uncertain, probably compromised by the convergent evolution of morphological characters.

Some authorities have placed the zokors within the Arvicolinae, but they have been shown to be unrelated.

A 2021 study found Lemmini to be the most basal group of Arvicolinae. The study also found &quot;Arvicola&quot; to actually fall outside the tribe Arvicolini, and to be sister to the tribe Lagurini.

== Classification ==
Subfamily Arvicolinae - voles, lemmings, muskrats

The subfamily Arvicolinae contains eleven tribes, eight of which are classified as voles, two as lemmings, and one as muskrats. Recent changes to the subfamily include disbanding genus &quot;Myodes&quot; in favor of genera &quot;Clethrionomys&quot; and &quot;Craseomys&quot; (and disbanding Myodini in favor of Clethrionomyini), moving most of the genera from Arvicolini to Microtini, and renaming Phenacomyini as Pliophenacomyini.

<doc id="1304112" wikidata="Q2091525" url="?curid=1304112" title="Marawah Island">
<text>Marawah () is a low-lying island off the coast of the Western Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.

==Geography==
Marawah is north of the Khor al-Bazm (lagoon) along the Abu Dhabi coastline in the southern Gulf. It lies west of the city and capital, Abu Dhabi. It is about from east to west and about from north to south. There are three islands in proximity to Marawah: the small island of Al Fiyah to the west, the island of Junaina to the southeast, and the island of Abu al Abyad in the east.

===Geology===
Current research indicates that the island was formed from relict Pleistocene limestone platforms linked by Holocene sand and beach deposits and intervening patches of &quot;sabkha&quot;.

===Environment===
Marawah island is in the Marawah Biosphere Reserve, as recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and is one of the six marine protected areas in the Zayed Network of Protected Areas, a network managed by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi.

The coastline of the island, with its extensive tidal mudflats, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports both passage and wintering populations of many waders, including grey plovers, Siberian sand plovers, bar-tailed godwits, great knots and crab-plovers.

== History ==
The west first became aware of the island around 1829 when the East India Company recorded its location in a nautical survey of the Persian Gulf.

== Archaeology ==
Although privately owned, the island is a key center of archaeology. Recent excavations yielded a small natural pearl that was carbon dated to 5800/5600 BCE. 

In 1992, the Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS) completed a preliminary survey of the island. Archeologists identified 13 sites dating from the Neolithic to the Islamic Period (12-13 AD).

In 2004, ADIAS discovered the oldest human skeleton ever found in the region amid the remains of Neolithic buildings and over 200 flint tools. DNA was extracted from teeth that were recovered from the site, and it was determined that the remains were about 7,500 years old.

<doc id="1304116" wikidata="Q1041160" url="?curid=1304116" title="Spadina station">
<text>Spadina is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Spadina Road, north of Bloor Street West. It is one of only three stations open overnight, along with Queens Quay station and Union station. 

The station consists of two separate sections, one for each line, at the same level and 150 metres apart. The north–south platforms, which opened in 1978, were originally planned as a separate station, but the TTC decided to join to the existing 1966 east–west station with a pedestrian tunnel containing a pair of long moving walkways. The cost of the moving walkways themselves became an issue when they became due for refurbishment or replacement, and they were shut down and ultimately removed in 2004, leaving the corridor as a simple underground walkway. The former location of the moving walkways remains visible because the tiles used to cover their removal are noticeably different. Warnings to hold the handrails are still embossed on the walls where the ends of the moving walkways were once located.

An underground loop for the 510 Spadina streetcar was added in 1997 near the east end of the east–west platforms. The streetcar platform adds Postmodern finishes to the station&#x27;s mix of styles. These range from the basic Modernist tiles of the Bloor–Danforth line platform, to the more intricate round tiles and backlit signage of the Yonge–University line platform.

In 1997, this station became accessible only to the Bloor–Danforth platforms and exit.

==Architecture and art==

=== Spadina and Bloor ===
The largest above ground structure is the bus station; its main entrance, along with elevators and a fare collector booth, is located on the east side of Spadina Road just north of Bloor Street, which currently serves as the terminus of the &quot;127 Davenport&quot; bus route. Originally, it was built to serve as a looping facility for the former &quot;77 Spadina&quot; bus which operated until the underground streetcar loop was added and the buses were replaced by &quot;510 Spadina&quot; streetcars. This building, with its pseudo-mansard roof and brick arches and no obvious bold signage like most other station entrances, is located at the easterly end of the Bloor line platforms. There is a secondary entrance building directly opposite, on the west side of Spadina Road, which is only accessible to those with Presto cards.

At the street level, there are three large cedar wood carvings called &quot;K&#x27;san Village House Posts&quot; depicting an owl, a wolf and a hawk. They are the work of Fedelia O&#x27;Brien, Murphy Green and Chuck Heit respectively, who are from the Gitxsan First Nation in British Columbia.

=== Walmer Road ===
There is an automatic entrance, accessible only to Presto card holders as of November 2017, on the east side of Walmer Road. It leads to the west end of the Bloor line platforms.

=== Norman B. Gash House ===
The main entrance to the Yonge–University line part of the station is concealed inside a house at 85 Spadina Road, which was built in 1899 and listed as a heritage property by the City of Toronto in 1974. The building was designed by architect Robert Ogilvie for lawyer Norman Gash. The property had previously been needed for construction of the Spadina Expressway, which was cancelled in 1971. Since it was still planned to build the subway on its original route along the course of the expressway, the site was subsequently acquired by Metropolitan Toronto in 1972, with the intention of replacing it with a new station building. Local protest forced the TTC to repurpose the old building, thereby retaining the residential character of the neighbourhood. Opposite the house, on the west side of Spadina Road at Kendal Avenue, there is an uncovered stairwell entrance to the station mezzanine. There are northbound and southbound bus stops outside the entrances. This entrance only accepts Presto cards.

This building includes two large artworks: &quot;Morning Glory&quot; by Louis de Niverville, a surreal enamel mural sited on the ground level by the stairwell; and &quot;Barren Ground Caribou&quot; by Joyce Wieland, a huge quilt featuring caribou in a tundra landscape, located near the unmanned turnstile on the concourse level below.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
This section of the Bloor line was constructed by cut and cover on a strip of land behind the properties fronting on the north side of Bloor Street. The tracks run east from here to the lower level of St. George station. Between the stations connecting tracks from the Bloor line rise on each side to the upper level of St. George station, like exit ramps on a highway, providing a link with the University line.

The section of the Yonge–University line at and between Dupont and Spadina stations was constructed under Spadina Road. South of the station the tunnel turns off-street and curves eastward through 90 degrees to run briefly parallel to Bloor Street before entering the upper level of St. George station.

==Station improvements==
In 2022, the Toronto Transit Commission proposed constructing elevators for the side platforms of Spadina station on Line 1; they will connect to the street level concourse. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

==Nearby landmarks==
The station is located in The Annex neighbourhood at the northwest corner of the University of Toronto main campus. Destinations and nearby points of interest include the Spadina Road Branch of the Toronto Public Library, Native Canadian Centre of Toronto, Miles Nadal Jewish Community Centre, Bloor Street United Church, and Trinity-St. Paul&#x27;s United Church.

==Surface connections==

When the subway is closed, streetcars still enter the station. TTC routes serving the station include:

<doc id="1304123" wikidata="Q3629825" url="?curid=1304123" title="Tej Bahadur Sapru">
<text>Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru (8 December 1875 20 January 1949) was an Indian freedom fighter, lawyer, and politician. He was a key figure in India&#x27;s struggle for independence, helping draft the Indian Constitution. He was the leader of the Liberal party in British-ruled India.

==Early life and career==

Tej Bahadur Sapru was born on 8 December, 1875 in Aligarh in the North-Western Provinces of British India (now in Uttar Pradesh, India) into a Kashmiri Pandit family. Sapru was the only son of Ambika Prasad Sapru, a zemindar, and his wife Gaura Sapru (née Hukku). Sapru&#x27;s mother Gaura was the sister of Niranjan Hukku, whose daughter Uma was married to Shyamlal Nehru, a first cousin of Jawaharlal Nehru. Sapru was also an eighth cousin of Allama Iqbal, a Muslim ideologue who was among those who formulated the very idea of Pakistan in the 1930s, who was later given the title of the national poet of Pakistan.

He was educated at the Agra College. Sapru worked in the Allahabad High Court as a lawyer where Purushottam Das Tandon, a future nationalist leader, worked as his junior. He later served as a dean of the Banaras Hindu University. On 13 December 1930, Sapru was admitted to the Middle Temple, but withdrew on 14 January 1932 without being called to the English bar.

==Political career==

Sapru served in the Legislative Council of the United Provinces (1913–16) and the Imperial Legislative Council (1916–20) and as a member for law affairs in the Viceroy&#x27;s Council (1920–23). Sapru and Indian Liberals collaborated with the Congress after the ascent of Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated non-violent civil disobedience against British rule. Sapru supported the Non-cooperation movement until (1920–22). He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in the 1923 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours list, As early as 1927, Sapru organised an All Party Conference to begin drafting the Indian Constitution. In 1928, he helped draft the Nehru Committee Report on Constitutional Reforms. It is acknowledged as the most important document related to the evolution of the Indian Constitution. For the first time in the history of India, it proposed uniting the princely states with the rest of India as a part of the federal polity.

Although initially a member of the Indian National Congress, India&#x27;s largest political party, Sapru left it to join the Liberal Party of India. He was also a member of the Hindu Mahasabha, sitting on its All-India Committee. While he supported &quot;Swaraj&quot; (Self Rule) and civil disobedience against British colonial rule, as a constitutionalist, Sapru advocated for greater political rights and freedoms for Indians to be achieved through dialogue with British authorities. For example, on 28 February 1930, he attended a dinner party organised by the Standing Committee of British India and minister advisers. Chimanlal Setalvad from Bombay was also present ready to co-operate with Muslims M. A. Jinnah, and M. R. Jayakar, alongside C. P. Ramaswami Aiyer from Madras. The Committee absorbed Haksar&#x27;s Report, and agreed to hold monthly meetings; their deliberations became known as the Sapru Committee recommendations. These &quot;conversations with the princes are very important&quot; declared New Delhi. Kailas Nath Haksar was a personal friend who also proposed federation of British and princely India, responsibility was a conservative counter-weight to radicalisation. They established good relations with the British Ministry of Works and Gandhi to build a forum for the round table conference. On 17 November 1930 the All-India Federation gained princely support for a constitutional relationship. Although unaware of the impact of this shift, Sapru sought out Gandhi and Nehru for conversations against civil disobedience movements. He was not successful, other than drawing criticism from Nehru about British control over the Army and financial safeguards. However they had more success in Bhopal and Bikaner, proposed the establishment of a Centre Party with allies in Oudh and United Provinces. They were in no stronger position when the Second Round Table Conference started. The factional splits were fatal to the princes cause; and Sapru&#x27;s severe criticisms of Maharaja of Dhollpur only served to postpone federation. But he persevered with colleagues Jayakar and Haksar to lobby officials, when he was informed the Viceroy warned against repudiation. Lord Willingdon remained aloof and indifferent to his efforts. The bureaucratic denials slowed attempts, and so in early 1932 Lord Lothian of the Franchise Committee made overtures towards Federation, they recruited Hailey&#x27;s organ &quot;The Pioneer&quot; to persuade the princes to donate.

Sapru and other Liberal politicians, eager to achieve independence through dialogue, participated in the central and provincial legislatures set up by the British, even though they were opposed by most Indian political parties and ignored by the people, who considered the legislatures to be unrepresentative &quot;rubber stamps&quot; for the Viceroy of India. Many Congress politicians respected Sapru as an eminent jurist, as he was a valuable and effective mediator. Sapru mediated between Gandhi and the Viceroy Lord Irwin, helping to forge the Gandhi–Irwin Pact that ended the Salt Satyagraha. Sapru also mediated between Gandhi, B. R. Ambedkar and the British over the issue of separate electorates for India&#x27;s &quot;Untouchables&quot;, which was settled by the Poona Pact. Sapru was chosen as the representative of Indian Liberals at the Round Table Conferences (1931–33), which sought to deliberate plans over granting more autonomy to Indians. His efforts along with those of his contemporary M. R. Jayakar at the Round Table Conferences for bridging the differences between the British administration and Congress are well known. But by Third Round Table many princes would not turn up, and their ministers were lukewarm about federation, and personalities clashed to exclude his able lieutenant Haksar. Sapru had to battle conservative intransigent and princely fickleness when participation was largely voluntary. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council on 26 February 1934.

Sapru supported the Viceroy&#x27;s decision to bring India into the Second World War in 1939, even as the Congress criticised the decision as unilateral and made without consulting the representatives of India&#x27;s people. Sapru was also one of the main lawyers engaged to defend captured soldiers of the rebel Indian National Army, raised by nationalist leader Subhas Chandra Bose with the aid of Imperial Japan during the warand the Quit India Movement (1942–46).

=== Sapru Committee Report ===

In 1944, the Standing Committee of the Non-Party Conference adopted a resolution to appoint a committee that would make recommendations on constitutional principles, taking into particular account issues of communal division in India. Sapru was invited to head the committee, and to appoint members representing various communities to participate in the preparation of its report. This report, titled &#x27;Constitutional Proposals of the Sapru Committee&#x27;, came to be commonly known as the Sapru Committee Report, and contained 21 recommendations pertaining to constitutional questions that concerned the governance and politics of India. The Report was published along with a detailed exposition of the reasoning behind these recommendations and included a number of notes of dissent from committee members, as well as details of correspondence regarding their deliberations between the committee and political figures such as Ambedkar, Gandhi, and others. The Sapru Committee Report rejected the proposal for the division of the Indian sub-continent into the two states of India and Pakistan, and made a number of recommendations for the protection of minorities in a unified state. While the Report did not receive much attention or consideration when it was published, it was cited and considered a number of times by the Constituent Assembly of India when drafting the Constitution of India.

==Personal life==

Sapru and his wife were the parents of five children. Their three sons were Prakash Narain Sapru, Trijugi Narain Sapru, and Anand Narain Sapru and their daughters were named Jagdambashwari and Bhuvaneshwari. Sapru was the grandfather of Jagdish Narain Sapru, former chairman of British Oxygen and of ITC Limited.

Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru died on 20 January 1949 in Allahabad, seventeen months after India gained independence.

<text>Destination Moon () is the sixteenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was initially serialised weekly in Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from March to September 1950 and April to October 1952 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1953. The plot tells of young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock who receive an invitation from Professor Calculus to come to Syldavia, where Calculus is working on a top-secret project in a secure government facility to plan a crewed mission to the Moon.

Developed in part through the suggestions of Hergé&#x27;s friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; was produced following Hergé&#x27;s extensive research into the possibility of human space travel – a feat that had yet to be achieved – with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. During the story&#x27;s serialisation, Hergé established Studios Hergé, a Brussels-based team of cartoonists to aid him on the project. Hergé concluded the story arc begun in this volume with &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have held the illustrative detail of the book in high esteem, but have expressed divided opinions of the story; some consider it to be among the most mature and emotionally resonant entries in the series, while others fault it for downplaying the humour seen in previous volumes in favour of the scientific focus of the narrative. The story was adapted for the 1957 Belvision animated series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1989 computer game &quot;Tintin on the Moon&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and the 1992–93 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock travel to join Professor Calculus, who has been commissioned by the Syldavian government to secretly build a spacecraft that will fly to the Moon. Arriving at the Sprodj Atomic Research Centre, they meet the centre&#x27;s managing director, Mr. Baxter, and Calculus&#x27; assistant, the engineer Frank Wolff. After witnessing Calculus test out a new multiplex helmet for the planned mission, they are informed of both his plan and his new use of an ear trumpet due to his signature hearing ailments. Haddock is against the plan, but due to him mistaking Haddock&#x27;s pipe for the ear trumpet (an error made in reverse by Haddock and corrected in a respective and consequent fire accident), Calculus instead believes he agreed. An uncrewed sub-scale prototype of the rocket – the &quot;X-FLR6&quot; – is launched on a circumlunar mission to photograph the far side of the Moon and test Calculus&#x27;s nuclear rocket engine. Before the launch, the centre&#x27;s radar picks up a plane which drops three paratroopers near to the centre. One of the men dies from a malfunctioning parachute; the incident coincides with the arrival of the police detectives Thomson and Thompson, who are initially believed to be the intruders.

Tintin sets out to locate the spies, telling Haddock to follow from the base, as he suspects a mole is on the inside. Wolff follows Haddock out of suspicion. Tintin catches one of the paratroopers during an exchange at an air vent, but is shot by the other before he is able to do anything. Simultaneously, the base experiences a temporary power outage, and confusion ensues, with neither Haddock (who passed out) nor Wolff (who was grabbed by the detectives) capable of explaining clearly what happened.

This incident confirms the centre&#x27;s suspicions that the paratroopers were agents of a foreign power, but Tintin fears that efforts to trace any leaked information would be futile. The rocket is successfully launched and orbits the Moon as planned, but on its return it is intercepted by the aforementioned foreign power, who have used the leaked information concerning the rocket&#x27;s radio control. However, Tintin had anticipated this and asked Calculus to rig a self-destruct mechanism for the rocket, and the Centre destroys the rocket to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Tintin reasons that there must have been an inside spy who leaked information to the paratroopers, but no suspects are found. Preparations are made for the crewed expedition to the moon, but after an argument with Haddock, in which Haddock accuses Calculus of &quot;acting the goat&quot; through the ear trumpet, Calculus becomes irate and angrily gives Haddock a forced tour of the Moon rocket. However, after telling the Captain to look where he&#x27;s going (Stars above, Captain! Behind you!), Calculus forgets to look where he is going, falls down a ladder, and suffers amnesia.

When Calculus&#x27; memory fails to be brought back, Haddock opts to use a violent shock to overcome Calculus&#x27; amnesia. He keeps trying increasingly more insane things, but his attempts repeatedly backfire. Eventually, after repeating the phrase &quot;you can keep acting the goat as long as you like&quot;, Haddock successfully and accidentally triggers Calculus&#x27; memory recovery. After regaining his knowledge on the rocket, construction is eventually completed, and the final preparations are made, with Calculus obtaining an actual hearing aid for near-perfect hearing of transmission signals. On the night of the launch, Haddock initially backs out, but after hearing Thomson and Thompson stating that he would be too old to go, he angrily declares his participation. The crew finally board the rocket, and later lose consciousness as the rocket successfully takes off due to the sudden g-force. Despite attempting to make contact, the ground crew are unable to get through, and the book ends with the rocket flying towards the Moon while the ground crew repeatedly calls, &quot;Earth calling Moon Rocket, are you receiving me?&quot;.

==History==
===Background===
Hergé first devised the idea of sending Tintin on a mission to the Moon while he was working on &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; (1949). His decision to move into the field of science fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had recently had success with his own science fiction comic, &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot; (1950–1953). He decided that it would be a two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (1943) and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; (1948) and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.
Seeking advice on the story, Hergé consulted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, who had authored the non-fiction book &quot;L&#x27;Homme parmi les étoiles&quot; (&quot;Man Among the Stars&quot;) (1944). In autumn 1947, Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke developed a script for the story, which they gave to Hergé. This version based Calculus&#x27; lunar expedition in a fictional location, Radio City, in the United States. It featured a return of Professor Decimus Phostle, a character who had previously appeared in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; (1942), but this time as an antagonist; Phostle had sold the secrets of the mission in order to attain funds to buy a diamond for the actress Rita Hayworth. In early 1948, Hergé produced two black-and-white pages of this version of the story before abandoning it. Hergé retained some elements of this original script in his finished version, namely the scenes in which Haddock drinks whiskey in a gravity-free environment and that in which Haddock goes for a space walk and nearly becomes a satellite of Adonis, which appear on pages 5 and 8 of &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;.

Nevertheless, Heuvelmans thought his influence on the story to be more significant, stating that &quot;in going through the two books we [he and Van Melkebeke] really had the impression that it was what we had originally done at the beginning. In broad outline, that was it&quot;.

Hergé hoped for the story to be as realistic as possible, and sought to eschew fantastical elements. In his own words, it contained &quot;no moonmen, no monsters, no incredible surprises&quot;. To ensure this realism, he collected a wide range of documents about rockets and space travel with which to conduct research. In this he was aided by Heuvelmans, who collected pictures of rockets and atomic research facilities for him. Hergé&#x27;s research archive included an article from the American magazine &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; which discussed how humanity could reach the Moon, as well as books by Pierre Rousseau and Auguste Piccard. A further work that he used was &quot;L&#x27;Astronautique&quot; (1950), a book on putative space travel by the physicist Alexander Ananoff, with whom Hergé began a correspondence in April 1950. He also visited the Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi&#x27;s Center for Atomic Research, striking up a subsequent correspondence with its director, Max Hoyaux. Hergé incorporated much of this technical information into the story, but juxtaposed it with moments of humour to make it more accessible to his young readership.

According to literary critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé&#x27;s story include Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Around the Moon&quot; and the 1950 American film &quot;Destination Moon&quot;. Hergé was certainly inspired by a number of photographic stills from the &quot;Destination Moon&quot; film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his Moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé&#x27;s rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon&#x27;s 1947 book &quot;German Research in World War II&quot;. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was realistic representation of what a Moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.

Hergé also inserted a cameo of Jacobs into the story, using him as the basis for a scientist that appears on page 40 of &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, a nod to Jacobs&#x27; inclusion of a reference to Hergé in one of his &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; mysteries, &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot; (1954).

===Publication===

Hergé announced the upcoming story with two consecutive covers of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine each depicting the Moon.
The story began serialisation in the Belgian &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from 30 March 1950, in the French language. It then began serialisation over the border in France, in that country&#x27;s edition of the magazine, from 11 May 1950. During this time, there were changes to how Hergé conducted his work; on 6 April 1950, he established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine&#x27;s main abode. The Studios would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work. He hired Bob de Moor as his primary apprentice at the Studios in March 1951. On 7 September 1950, only six months after the start of serialisation, the story was interrupted due to the fact Hergé was suffering another breakdown and had been developing eczema on his hands. On 9 April 1952, the story was continued in &quot;Tintin&quot;.

The story was collected together and published by Editions Casterman as &quot;Objectif Lune&quot; in 1953. The title had been Hergé&#x27;s own choice, having rejected Casterman&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;Tintin and the Nuclear Rocket&quot;. For publication in book form, the story was re-coloured, with various changes being made; for instance, in the serialised version, the uniforms worn by staff were green, and they are changed to blue for the book volume. A number of scenes were also deleted, including Snowy about to be thrown out into outer space accidentally by Haddock, the Thompsons getting lost on their moonwalk. Hergé sent a copy to Ananoff, with a message stating that &quot;your help, your knowledge, has been invaluable, enabling me to get my little characters to the Moon... and to bring them back safe and sound&quot;. An English-language translation of the book was published in 1959.

Marking the Apollo 11 Moon landings in 1969, Hergé produced an illustration in which NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong has just arrived on the Moon, only to be greeted by Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus carrying roses and a sign welcoming him. That same year, the French magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot; commissioned him to produce a short comic documenting the Apollo 12 landings.

==Critical analysis==

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that the two-part story &quot;belongs&quot; to Calculus, because his &quot;cosmic vision moves the story forward&quot;. They further expressed the opinion that Wolff was a unique character in the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, suggesting that he is akin to a character from a John le Carré novel.
They felt that the Moon adventure was &quot;Hergé at his best... a triumphant achievement on every level&quot;, awarding both halves of the story five stars out of five. Harry Thompson described the entire Moon adventure as &quot;a technical masterpiece&quot; as a result of its &quot;uncannily accurate&quot; depiction of the Moon. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline felt that the two Moon adventures &quot;mark a stage in the development of Hergé&#x27;s work&quot;. Conversely, Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters was critical of the two-part story arc, stating that they had &quot;neither the liveliness and dynamism&quot; of &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;/&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, &quot;nor the supernatural quality&quot; of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;/&quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;.

In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès praised the &quot;Destination Moon&quot;-&quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; story arc for its &quot;meticulous attention to scientific facts&quot;, but added that this had also resulted in the story&#x27;s &quot;rather pedagogical tone&quot;. He added that in these stories, the main division was &quot;no longer Good and Evil&quot; as it had been in previous &quot;Adventures&quot;, but &quot;Truth and Error&quot;. Apostolidès opined that despite being a &quot;fussy and somewhat ridiculous character&quot;, through his scientific achievements Calculus grows to the &quot;stature of a giant&quot; in this arc, eclipsing Sir Francis Haddock (from &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;) as the series&#x27; &quot;founding ancestor&quot;. He goes on to claim that in becoming the &quot;sacred ancestor&quot;, the voyage to the Moon becomes &quot;a mystical quest&quot; with science as its guiding religion. Drawing comparisons between this arc and the &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; story, he drew symbolic links between the scientific centre and the Inca Temple of the Sun, but noted that here Calculus was the &quot;high priest&quot; rather than the sacrificial victim as he had been in the previous story.
Moving on to discuss the Moon rocket in these stories, Apostolidès described it as a phallic object which penetrated the &quot;virgin territory&quot; of the Moon. At the same time, he described the rocket as a &quot;maternal belly&quot; in which the space explorers slept.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that in the &quot;Destination Moon&quot;-&quot;Explorers of the Moon&quot; story arc, Calculus &quot;embodies Hergé&#x27;s ... own wartime position, spun out into a post-war environment&quot;, representing a genius driven by his work whose activities are coincidental to national and political causes. He suggested that the scene in which Captain Haddock rides a pantomime hobby horse can be contrasted with the many scenes in which Haddock is thrown off of a horse&#x27;s back during the &quot;Adventures&quot;. McCarthy also interpreted the scene in which Calculus cries and tears at his hair in response to the rocket&#x27;s capture by the enemy as reflecting Hergé&#x27;s own anxieties at having his work published and reinterpreted by his readers. He was also of the opinion that several scenes in &quot;Destination Moon&quot; reflected recurring themes throughout the series; he suggested that Haddock&#x27;s attempts at smuggling whisky into Syldavia echoed the smuggling of treasure in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, while the &quot;correction&quot; in which Thompson and Thomson were recognised as not being spies reflected a theme of corrections in the series. He also believed that there was an example of Hergé&#x27;s secret vulgarity within &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, with a diagram above Calculus&#x27; head in one scene resembling buttocks.

==Adaptation==
In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based on Hergé&#x27;s original comics, adapting eight of the &quot;Adventures&quot; into a series of daily five-minute episodes. &quot;Destination Moon&quot; was the first to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a second animated series based upon &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. &quot;Destination Moon&quot; was the fourteenth story to be adapted and was divided into two twenty-minute episodes. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot; to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé&#x27;s original panels.

<text>Kailash Nath Katju (17 June 1887 – 17 February 1968) was a prominent politician of India. He was the Governor of Odisha and West Bengal, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, the Union Home Minister and the Union Defence Minister. He was also one of India&#x27;s most prominent lawyers. He was part of some of the most notable cases of his times, including the Indian National Army trials. Katju joined the Indian independence movement early on and spent several years incarcerated with fellow independence activists for his activities.

==Early life==
Kailash Nath Katju was born in the princely state of Jaora (in present-day Madhya Pradesh) on 17 June 1887. His family were Kashmiri Pandits who had settled in Jaora. His father Tribhuwan Nath Katju was a former dewan of the state. Kailash Nath was educated at the Barr High School in Jaora, when he was sent to Lahore to study at the Rang Mahal School. He passed his matriculation examination from Panjab University the following year before completing his graduation from Forman Christian College, Lahore, in March 1905. In July that year, he joined the Muir Central College in Allahabad. In September 1907, he received a degree in laws from the Allahabad University, standing second in the province. In 1908, he received a master&#x27;s degree in history from the same university. He began legal profession that year in Kanpur before moving to Allahabad in 1914. He completed his doctorate in law, the LL.D. from Allahabad University in 1919, joining the Allahabad High Court as an advocate in 1921.

==Career==
Katju defended the accused in the Meerut Conspiracy Case in Allahabad High Court in 1933 and later the military officers accused at the Indian National Army trials at the Red Fort in Delhi. On 17 July 1937, he became the Minister of Law and Justice and Parliamentary Affairs of the United Provinces in the Govind Ballabh Pant&#x27;s cabinet. He was elected to the legislature from the constituency of Allahabad district (Doaba). The ministry resigned on 2 November 1939 and soon Katju was imprisoned for 18 months. He was again imprisoned in 1942. He also served in the Constituent Assembly of India. Between 1935 and 1937, he served as the chairman of the Allahabad Municipal Board, and later as chancellor of Prayag Mahila Vidyapith, Allahabad.

Following the independence of India, Katju held many high political positions. Initially he was made the Governor of Orissa from 15 August 1947 to 20 June 1948. He became the Governor of West Bengal on 21 June 1948 and was in office till 31 October 1951. In 1951 he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Mandsaur constituency, joining the cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru as Law Minister in 1951. In November 1951 he succeeded C. Rajagopalachari as the country&#x27;s third Home Minister. In 1955 he was made the Defence Minister. He became the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on 31 January 1957, remaining in office till 11 March 1962. He also held the portfolios for general administration, home, publicity, planning and development, co-ordination and anti-corruption.

==Personal life==
Katju and his wife Rup Kishori had five children together: three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Shiva Nath Katju, served as a judge at the Allahabad High Court, and after retirement, took up politics and was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh legislature. Another son, Brahma Nath Katju, rose to serve as chief justice of the same Allahabad High Court.

Katju&#x27;s grandsons have also achieved distinction. His grandson Markandey (son of Shiv Nath) served as a judge in the Supreme Court of India. Another grandson is Vivek Katju, IFS, a retired diplomat who served in several sensitive positions. Tilottama Mukherji, a professor at New York University and first wife of politician and former diplomat Shashi Tharoor, is Katju&#x27;s grand-daughter (daughter&#x27;s daughter).

Katju had recovered from a kidney ailment he had suffered in the summer of 1967. After his condition deteriorated in early February 1968, he died at 7:55 p.m. (IST) on 17 February 1968 at his residence in Allahabad. The last rites were performed by son Shiva Nath on the bank of the Ganges the following day.

==Publications==
Dr Kailash Nath Katju wrote many books, some of which are the following::
* Experiments in Advocacy: A Colossus in the Courts of Justice
* The days I remember
* Reminiscences and experiments in advocacy

He also wrote many articles and delivered many memorable speeches, including the following:
* Some Judges and Lawyers whom I knew
* Speech delivered on 27 November 1966, on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the High Court Building.

===Founder of National Herald===
He was one of the founders of Associated Journals Ltd. and one of the seven original subscribers of the Memorandum of Association of the company which published National Herald and two other newspapers. His shares were taken over by a company formed and closely held by Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi and two others in 2012. There is a legal case of criminal conspiracy in this regard against them in a court of law in Delhi.

<text>Birds of Fire is the second studio album by jazz fusion band the Mahavishnu Orchestra. It was released in 1973 by Columbia Records and is the last studio album released by the original line-up before it dissolved.

As with the group&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Inner Mounting Flame&quot;, &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; consists solely of compositions by John McLaughlin. These include the track &quot;Miles Beyond (Miles Davis)&quot;, which McLaughlin dedicated to his friend and former bandleader.

The back cover of the album features the poem &quot;Revelation&quot; by Sri Chinmoy.

The track &quot;Birds of Fire&quot; was nominated for the 1974 Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

==Release history==
In addition to the standard two-channel stereo album there was also a four-channel quadraphonic version released in 1973 on LP and 8-track tape. The quad LP was encoded in the SQ matrix format.

The first CD issue was in 1986. A remastered version of the album was released on CD in 2000 by Sony Music Entertainment. It features a new set of liner notes by &quot;JazzTimes&quot; critic Bill Milkowski, as well as photographs of the band. In 2015 the album was re-issued on Super Audio CD by Audio Fidelity containing both the stereo and quad mixes. The same content was re-issued on SACD in Japan in 2021 by Sony Music.

The track &quot;Celestial Terrestrial Commuters&quot; appears on the six-CD box set &quot;&quot;, released by Smithsonian Folkways in 2011, covering the history of jazz. 

==Reception==
Reviewing the album for &quot;All About Jazz&quot; in 2002, Walter Kolosky wrote of the title track:

&quot;Birds of Fire,&quot; which opens up the album, is a fusion classic. John McLaughlin scares the hell out of his guitar with his melodic convulsions. If you ever want to frighten a musical neophyte, turn your stereo up really loud and play the cover tune – it&#x27;s guaranteed to send him or her fleeing.

<doc id="1304150" wikidata="Q680286" url="?curid=1304150" title="Bolbec">
<text>Bolbec () is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region in northern France. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Bolbécais&quot; or &quot;Bolbécaises&quot;.

==Geography==
A farming, quarrying and light industrial town situated at the heart of three valleys in the Pays de Caux, some northeast of Le Havre. It is the source of the river Commerce, though here it is known as the river Bolbec. The town has many small lanes (&quot;ruelles&quot;) with some pretty houses.

==History==
The first written record of the town dates from the end of the 11th century, as &quot;Bolebec&quot;. Archeological discoveries indicate that the site has been inhabited since ancient times. The first lord of Bolbec was Osbern de Bolbec (around 992) and the last was the Duc de Charost who was executed during the French Revolution. Through the Norman family of de Bolbec, the town gives its name to the village of Swaffham Bulbeck in Cambridgeshire, England.
Bolbec developed thanks to the numerous mills which lined the river banks through the town. These mills, numbering 14 in the middle of the 19th century, allowed the development of a textile industry based on water power, and later steam, to power the machinery.

Today, only three mills remain: one at the source of the river in the grounds of the Oril factory; one at Vallot; and one in the Ruelle Papavoine.

At the end of the 18th century, a number of manufacturers installed themselves in Bolbec to produce &quot;Indiennes&quot; (printed textiles). On the eve of the Revolution, Bolbec had 18 factories. In 1806, there were 27 producing &quot;Indiennes&quot; employing nearly 800 workers.

The importance of textiles in the Bolbec Valley was recognised by the state with the creation of the &quot;Chambre des Arts et Manufactures&quot; in 1806 (which became the Chamber of Commerce and Industry) and further, with the creation of a &quot;Conseil des Prud&#x27;hommes&quot; in 1813. However, over the years the textile industry suffered economic crises and by the end of the 19th century there was just one &quot;indiennerie&quot; remaining.

Bolbec is the last French town in which Thomas Jefferson, his family, and Sally and James Hemings stayed in 1789 prior to their arrival in Le Havre to return to America after their time in Paris.

===Bolbec today===
Little remains of the textile history of the town. A single former factory remains, that of the Desgenétais works, closed in 1986. In effect, this site is the last witness of the impact of the textile factories on Bolbec town planning: school, creche, chapel, workers&#x27; and foremen&#x27;s houses… The site provides an exceptional insight into the epoch.

===Heraldry===
==Population==
==Economy==
Bolbec is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bolbec - Lillebonne.

===Industry===
The principal employers in Bolbec are Oril Industrie, part of the Servier Pharmaceutical group, and Cooper Standard Automotive, automobile equipment manufacturers specialising in waterproofing

<doc id="1304151" wikidata="Q241313" url="?curid=1304151" title="Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska">
<text>Theresa Kunegunda (, , ) (4 March 1676 – 27 March 1730) was a Polish princess, Electress of Bavaria and of the Electorate of the Palatinate. By birth she was member of the House of Sobieski and by marriage member of the House of Wittelsbach. She also served as Regent of the Palatinate in 1704–05.

==Biography==
She was a daughter of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania John III Sobieski and his wife, Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d&#x27;Arquien. While her parents had thirteen children she was the only daughter to survive childhood.

Theresa was baptized in Jaworow on 19 July 1676, having for her godfather Charles II, king of England and for her godmother Marie-Thérèse of Austria, wife of Louis XIV, both by proxy.

Theresa was educated in painting and music, Latin, Italian and French. At the beginning of 1692, her father planned to marry her to the Crown Prince of Denmark, but this project was subsequently abandoned.

===Wedding===
On 15 August 1694, at the age of nineteen, she married Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. He was a former comrade in arms of her father and widower of Maria Antonia of Austria. The marriage took place by proxy in Warsaw, her oldest brother standing in for Max Emanuel. She would not meet the latter until 1 January 1695 in Brussels. Her journey, paid for by her mother, lasted approximately 50 days and was accompanied by splendors. Her dowry was 500,000 thalers. In honor of her wedding to Max Emanuel the opera &quot;Amor vuol il giusto&quot; was created and staged. It used a libretto by the Italian writer Giovanni Battista Lampugnani.

===Regency===
In the Spanish Netherlands, Theresa gave birth to six children before the family moved to Munich in May 1701. Following the evacuation of the Bavarian court from the Spanish Netherlands after the defeat of the Battle of Blenheim (13 August 1704), she became Regent of the Government of the Elector of Bavaria. The move was smart since, legally, the war was against the Elector and not Theresa. It was the only time a woman ruled the Bavarian Electorate. However, Emperor Leopold I forced her to sign the treaty of Ilbersheim on 5 November 1704. This included a cease-fire and gave Theresa the Munich Rentamt, one of the four administrative districts of the Duchy of Bavaria, while the rest of Bavaria is placed under the military supervision of the Austrian Empire. At the beginning of this phase, Theresa strove to decide in collaboration with Max Emanuel but the courier took too long for this to be effective. She also had to face the defection of part of the Bavarian nobility in favour of the emperor.

===Exile===
On 21 December 1704 she gave birth to the last of her sons. In February 1705, she left to meet her mother in Padua following the discovery of written correspondence between her husband and Agnès Le Louchier, the Countess of Arco, his mistress. Upon her return in May, the imperial army would not allow him to return to Munich, in violation of the treaty of Ilbersheim. Her four sons were looked after by the Austrians in Klagenfurt while her two youngest boys and her daughter remained in Munich.

After the battle of Ramillies, on 23 May 1706, Max Emanuel was forced to flee the Spanish Netherlands and found refuge at the court of France located in Versailles. Max Emmanuel would live with his French mistress Agnès Le Louchier during his exile from 1704 to 1715.

Theresa negotiated her return to Munich from the Emperor by asking for the help of the Republic of Venice, Pope Clement XI, Prince Eugene of Savoy and Anne, Queen of Great Britain. She tried to use the Duke of Modena and the Grand Duchess of Tuscany as mediators, but to no avail. On the domestic level, the financial and military retributions imposed by Joseph I created many revolts and she lost a son. Consequently, Theresa spent ten years in exile in Venice, not returning until 1715 when the War of the Spanish Succession ended and Max Emanuel regained his electorate on 7 September 1714 by the Treaty of Baden. Despite a short reign of seven months, Theresa left a positive balance where in particular the role of the nobility was improved.

===Later life===
 On 8 April 1715 she finally reunited with her husband. She founded the Servitinnen monastery in Munich dedicated to Saint Elisabeth the same year. On the death of her husband in February 1726, she did not remarry but retired to Venice, where she died in 1730. She rests in the Theatine Church in Munich.

==Children==
She was the mother of ten children by her husband, including Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII and Clemens August of Bavaria, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, though only six of them survived till adulthood.

*A stillborn child (1695)
*Maria Anna Karoline (1696–1750), a nun

<text>St. George is a station on Line 1 Yonge–University and Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway. It is located north of Bloor Street West between St. George Street and Bedford Road. It is the second-busiest station in the system after Bloor–Yonge station, serving a combined total of approximately people a day. 

==Entrances==

* The St. George Street entrance is an unstaffed automatic entrance. It is located on the east side of St. George Street just north of Bloor Street West at 
* The Bedford entrance is wheelchair accessible and is staffed during all hours of operation. It is located on the west side of Bedford Road just north of Bloor Street West at . Patrons board the 26 Dupont bus from a platform within the station&#x27;s fare-paid area. 
* There is also an unstaffed automatic entrance from Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.

==History==

The station was first opened on February 28, 1963, for the Yonge–University line, followed by the Bloor–Danforth line on February 26, 1966.

Between 1963 and 1966, there was a direct surface connection at the Bedford Road subway entrance to Bloor and Danforth streetcars. The &quot;Bedford Loop&quot; was immediately south of the station structure and had opened in 1954 to provide a short turn facility for westbound streetcars serving Bloor station on the new Yonge Subway. Streetcars entered from Bedford Road, turned west into the loop beside the station, and exited south on to Bloor Street. The platform was on the east side of what is now the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, with a TTC transformer station constructed at the former entrance and the exit where the Bloor–Bedford Parkette is situated. This loop gave passengers travelling in peak hours a more direct connection between the subway and eastbound and westbound streetcars than walking to/from the curbside stops. The loop closed in February 1966 when streetcar routes were replaced by the Bloor–Danforth line.

In 1999, this station became accessible with elevators.

In late August 2019, the TTC installed platform door markers along the edge of the station&#x27;s southbound platform as a pilot to improve customer flow when a southbound train is in station. These indicate where customers waiting to board should stand to avoid obstructing customers leaving the train. Automated train control (ATC) ensures that train doors and decals perfectly match up. Blue decals are located near the train doors for accessible seating; customers with mobility problems have priority boarding.

===Interlining===
St. George and stations are both two-level stations with two platforms, with Line 1 on the upper level, and Line 2 on the lower level at St. George. Between these stations and is a full double-track, grade-separated wye junction. The tracks to and from Museum connect to the upper-level platforms at St. George and the lower-level platforms at Bay stations, while the tracks along Bloor use the lower level at St. George and the upper level at Bay. From February to September 1966, all three sides of the wye were used in regular service: from each of three termini—, , and —trains ran alternately to the other two (between Eglinton and Museum they went via ).

After the six months of interlining, the Bloor–Danforth Line became a separate route and the lower platforms at Bay (sometimes called Lower Bay) were closed. The upper-level platforms at St. George became the terminus of the Yonge–University line until 1978, when the extension to was opened. Lower Bay is sometimes used as a movie or TV set, and has been used for platform-surface experiments.

===Paul Arthur signage===

Some areas of the station contain wayfinding signage with the image of a crest with a dragon, referencing the Christian legend of St. George. However, St. George Street is actually named for Quetton St. George, a French-born British citizen who lived in Toronto in the 19th century. The signs were designed by Paul Arthur and installed in 1993 as part of a new system of wayfinding signage, which was to be implemented in the entire subway system. Ultimately, the TTC did not go through with the project but did not remove the prototypes either, preserving some of Arthur&#x27;s designs.

A further wayfinding project began implementation in 2014: using circles with the colour and number of each line to identify them more easily. Signage for that project rolled out at station in March of that year, with St. George set to be the next to follow.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

Both platforms lie on an east–west alignment, with the Line 1 platform being one of three platforms on that line with an east–west orientation, the others being and . Upon leaving the station, the line curves south by 90 degrees to run under Queen&#x27;s Park (the street). The two tracks split into separate tunnels in this area, briefly running at different levels to form a grade-separated junction with the second pair of link tracks from the Bloor–Danforth line, which curves in from the east.

==Tenants==
* Gateway Newstands (one at the St. George entrance/exit and another at the Bedford entrance/exit)

==Nearby landmarks==

Nearby landmarks include the Bata Shoe Museum, University of Toronto Schools, the north side of the University of Toronto, the Royal Conservatory of Music, the Chinese Consul General, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the York Club.

<text>Eros Walter Luciano Ramazzotti (; born 28 October 1963) is an Italian pop singer and songwriter. He is popular in Italy and most European countries, and throughout the Spanish-speaking world, as he has released most of his albums in both Italian and Spanish.

Since 1984, Ramazzotti has released 11 studio albums, one EP, three compilation albums, three live albums, and 37 singles. He has sold over 70 million records in his 40-year career. His repertoire includes duets with artists such as Cher, Tina Turner, Andrea Bocelli, Patsy Kensit, Anastacia, Joe Cocker, Julio Iglesias, Lynn Davis, Ricardo Arjona, Luciano Pavarotti, Laura Pausini, Nicole Scherzinger and Ricky Martin.

Ramazzotti first gained international success in 1993, with the release of &quot;Tutte storie&quot;, which amassed five million album sales and occupied the top five in every country where he had previously released albums. This success led to a BMG International record contract in 1994. His audience appeal comes from several factors, including his unique voice, which can be described as somewhat nasal but nevertheless forceful and resonant baritone, and his energetic delivery of catchy, melodic tunes which are often passionate mid-tempo autobiographical ballads, with instrumentation that is rich in soft-rock influence.

== Biography ==
=== Childhood and early beginnings (1963–1981) ===
Ramazzotti was born in Cinecittà Est, a suburb of Rome. He is the son of Rodolfo Ramazzotti, a construction worker and Raffaela Molina, a housewife. His father originated from the province of Viterbo in Lazio and his mother from the province of Vibo Valentia in Calabria. He was named after Eros, the Greek god of love. He began playing the guitar at age seven. As a teenager, he wrote songs with the help of his father who was a music lover and played piano. He wanted to attend a musical conservatory but failed the admission examination, and started training in bookkeeping, but dropped out. He occasionally appeared as an extra in films while dreaming of having a career as a pop-star.

In 1981, Ramazzotti took part in a music contest, &quot;Voci Nuove di Castrocaro&quot; (New Voices of Castrocaro Terme) with the song &quot;Rock 80&quot;, which he wrote, performing in front of various record label representatives. Although the contest was won by Zucchero and Fiordaliso, Ramazzotti reached the final and received two votes from Roberto Galanti and Baron Lando Lanni, who represented the recently launched Italian Label DDD (Drogueria di Drugolo). DDD gave Eros his first contract. He moved to Milan with his brother Marco and his mother Raffaella, and they initially lived in the same building as the record label company.

=== Career breakthrough (1982–1986) ===

Ramazzotti&#x27;s first single, &quot;Ad un amico&quot; (), was released in 1982, and was not particularly well received. Soon after, Eros met Renato Brioschi, who mentored the young artist toward his first success in 1984 at the highly regarded Sanremo Festival. His song, &quot;Terra promessa&quot; () won the Newcomers&#x27; category, and was subsequently released widely throughout Europe.

In 1985, Ramazzotti took part in the Sanremo Festival again with the song &quot;Una storia importante&quot; (), taken from his debut album &quot;Cuori agitati&quot; (). While only placing sixth at the festival, &quot;Una storia importante&quot; was released as a single and became a huge hit in many European countries, including France where it sold a million units. His second album &quot;Nuovi eroi&quot; (), released in 1986, earned two Platinum-awards in Switzerland with over 100,000 sales, and Gold status in Germany with over 250,000 sales. At his third Sanremo Festival appearance in 1986 his memorable single, &quot;Adesso tu&quot; () from &quot;Nuovi eroi&quot; won the overall competition.
=== Popularity established (1987–1994) ===

In 1987, Ramazzotti went on a nine-month-long tour after releasing his third album &quot;In certi momenti&quot; (Sometimes), performing in front of more than a million people. &quot;In certi momenti&quot; went Gold in Germany with over 250,000 sales and Platinum in Switzerland with over 50,000 sales, and reached more than 3 million copies worldwide. As his career developed, he performed &quot;La Luce Buona Delle Stelle&quot; (The Good Light of the Stars) with Patsy Kensit on 22 November 1987, and released a seven-track mini-album &quot;Musica è&quot; (Music Is) in May 1988.

His fifth album, &quot;In ogni senso&quot; (In Every Sense), released in April 1990, attracted more than two hundred journalists from around the world to the album&#x27;s press conference launch in Venice. An American record producer, Clive Davis, advised Ramazzotti to hold a concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and he became the first Italian artist to perform at the renowned concert hall, performing before a sell-out crowd. However, he was later disappointed to learn that most of his audience was of Italian descent, having hoped for a more widespread breakthrough. During that visit to the US, Ramazzotti also performed on TV shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Good Morning America. &quot;In ogni senso&quot; earned multiple Gold and Platinum album awards around the world, including a Platinum in Germany for over 500,000 sales, a triple Platinum in Switzerland for over 150,000 sales, and Platinum in the Netherlands for sales of over 100,000 units.

His 1991 double-CD release &quot;Eros in Concert&quot; was followed by another long tour, including a concert in Barcelona, Spain before 20,000 fans on 4 December, the day of his live CD&#x27;s release.

In 1993, he released &quot;Tutte storie&quot; (All Stories), and he toured in Europe and 15 Latin American countries, where he has released his Spanish language albums. That November, Ramazzotti performed &quot;Cose della vita&quot; (Things of Life) at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Berlin. &quot;Tutte storie&quot; entered the Top-5 album list in many countries in Europe including Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway. The album earned Ramazzotti four Platinums in Switzerland for sales of over 200,000 units, a Platinum in Germany for sales of over 500,000 units, and Platinum status in many other counties including the Netherlands, Sweden, Argentina and Austria. &quot;Tutte storie&quot; eventually sold five million copies worldwide which played a significant role in helping Ramazzotti get his contract with BMG International.

=== Worldwide Commercial Success (1995–2002) ===
In the summer of 1995, Ramazzotti participated in the European summer festival along with Rod Stewart, Elton John and Joe Cocker. His six-million-seller album, &quot;Dove c&#x27;è musica&quot; (Where There Is Music) was released on 13 May 1996, his first completely self-produced album. On 5 December of the same year, his companion of several years and future wife Michelle Hunziker (Swiss model and television host) gave birth to their daughter, Aurora Sophie.

In October 1997, he released &quot;Eros – Greatest Hits&quot;, which contained two new songs, &quot;Quanto Amore Sei&quot; (How Much Love Are You) and &quot;Ancora un minuto di sole&quot; (Just One More Minute of Sunshine), as well as reworked versions of previous hits including &quot;Musica è&quot; (duet with Andrea Bocelli) and &quot;Cose Delle Vita-Can&#x27;t Stop Thinking of You&quot; as a duet with Tina Turner. This collection entered the Top-5 in France, Belgium, Sweden and Finland, and reached No. 1 in several countries including Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Norway, selling 1.2 million units in its first week of release according to BMG International.
The album was certified five times Platinum by IFPI (Europe) for selling well over five million units in Europe alone. The album also attained two Latin-type Platinum certifications by RIAA for sales of over 400,000 units in USA. That year, Ramazzotti was awarded &quot;Best International Male Artist of the Year&quot; at Germany&#x27;s Echo Music Awards.

In 1998, he released the live CD &quot;Eros Live&quot;, which included two duets recorded during the world tour, &quot;Cose della vita-Can&#x27;t Stop Thinking of You&quot; featuring Tina Turner, and &quot;That&#x27;s All I Need to Know-Difenderò&quot; with Joe Cocker, performed in Munich. In 1999, Ramazzotti again collaborated with Italian superstar Andrea Bocelli, singing &quot;Nel Cuore Lei&quot; (In Your Heart) for Bocelli&#x27;s album, &quot;Sogno&quot; (Dream). The album sold over 10 million albums worldwide, gaining more recognition for Ramazzotti. In 1999, he was again awarded as &quot;Best International Male Artist of the Year&quot; at Germany&#x27;s Echo Music Awards. Throughout his career, Ramazzotti has done duets with some very well known artists such as Cher, Andrea Bocelli, Joe Cocker, Carlos Santana, Tina Turner, Anastacia, Luciano Pavarotti, and Laura Pausini.

Ramazzotti gained a reputation as a seasoned producer with the album &quot;Come fa bene l&#x27;amore&quot; (Feels good to love) by Gianni Morandi in the beginning of 2000. That October, he delivered his eighth studio album &quot;Stilelibero&quot; (Freestyle), which contained a duet with the American diva, Cher, in the song &quot;Più che puoi&quot; (As Much As You Can). The album, the result of a collaboration of several producers including Celso Valli, Claudio Guidetti, Trevor Horn and Rick Nowels, reached the Top-5 album charts throughout Europe and was certified two times Platinum by IFPI (Europe) for sales of over two million units in Europe alone. In the course of the international tour for &quot;Stilelibero&quot;, Ramazzotti also appeared in eastern European countries including Moscow, Russia where he gave a three-day sold-out concerts at Kremlin Palace.

=== Continued success (2003–present) ===

On 30 May 2003, Ramazzotti released his ninth studio album, entitled &quot;9&quot;. The first single, &quot;Un&#x27;emozione per sempre&quot; (An Emotion Forever) was released on 9 May, and was number one in Italy&#x27;s official single chart for 14 consecutive weeks.
The album, produced along with Claudio Guidetti and Eros&#x27;s longtime musical friend Celso Valli, stayed at the No. 1 position for nine weeks in Italy&#x27;s official album chart. &quot;9&quot; went on selling 3 million copies, 1.1 million of which were sold in Italy alone. He began his world tour in Ancona, Italy which was set to have 100 dates in front of audiences of up to one million people (56 dates of which were done in Europe in front of 550,000 people).

On 28 October 2005, Ramazzotti&#x27;s 10th album &quot;Calma apparente&quot; (Apparent Calm) was released on the day of his birthday, which he produced together with Claudio Guidetti. The album &quot;Calma apparente&quot;, which was certified Platinum within a period of just one month after its release for selling over one million copies in Europe, contains the duet hit single &quot;I Belong to You&quot; with American singer Anastacia, the single went No. 1 in several countries including Italy, Germany and Switzerland. Throughout the years, Eros has gained popularity especially in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Venezuela, and most Spanish-speaking countries.

More than ten years after Ramazzotti&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;Eros&quot;, which has sold a total of 7.5 million copies worldwide and has reached No. 1 in many countries including Germany, Ramazzotti released a new double-CD compilation-album &quot;e²&quot; on 26 October 2007; the first CD contained four new tracks and 14 original songs in a remastered format, and the second CD had 17 redone tracks, and feature artists such as Carlos Santana, Wyclef Jean, Steve Vai, Jon Spencer. The four unreleased pieces on the &quot;e²&quot; album include a new international duet &quot;Non siamo soli&quot; (We&#x27;re Not Alone) which Eros sings along with Latin pop star Ricky Martin. This became the first single taken off the album, and was available for sale on 5 October 2007, reaching the top spot in Italy and entering the top-5 in Switzerland and Spain. In Spain, the Spanish-language version &quot;No estamos solos&quot; was certified four times Platinum for having been downloaded over 80,000 times in Digital format, whereas it was certified six times Platinum for having been downloaded 120,000 in Original Tone format (equivalent to US Master Ringtone). The single was written, both in Italian and Spanish, by Ramazzotti and his longtime songwriting partner Claudio Guidetti.

Ramazzotti&#x27;s 11-track album, &quot;Ali e radici&quot; (&quot;Wings and Roots&quot;), was released on 22 May 2009, produced by Eros himself as well as his longtime musical partner Claudio Guidetti; in addition, six tracks on the album are co-produced by Michele Canova who has previously worked with artists such as Laura Pausini, Tiziano Ferro and Jovanotti. The first single &quot;Parla con me&quot; (&quot;Talk to Me&quot;), released on 17 May 2009, off his 11th studio album, is a catchy pop song which has peaked at No. 1 in Italy and No. 8 in Switzerland. The album was available both in a standard-edition as well as in a deluxe-edition, which includes 64-page booklet of photographs, and it entered the Top-5 in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, and was number-one in Italy and Switzerland.

Ramazzotti&#x27;s next studio album was released in Italy on 12 May 2015, entitled &quot;Perfetto&quot;. The album contains 14 tracks, which have been recorded in Los Angeles, Milan and Rome. The songs are produced by Ramazzotti and his longtime partner Claudio Guidetti. The first single from the album is &quot;Alla Fine Del Mondo&quot;, which was released on 27 March 2015.

Ramazzotti recalls being extremely shy in the early 1980s before achieving fame:

In spite of being born and raised in Rome, he is famous for his loyal support of Juventus. On 26 March 2012, he was awarded a personal star by club legend Pavel Nedvěd as recognition of his importance as a supporter of the club.

His 320-page autobiography, co-written by Luca Bianchini, was published on 13 April 2006.

<text>The Calhoun Street Extension is a series of roads in Trenton, New Jersey, and nearby Lawrence Township. It runs from the Calhoun Street Bridge over the Delaware River to Brunswick Circle, and is composed of the following named streets:
*Calhoun Street
*Part of Princeton Avenue
*Brunswick Circle Extension
The Extension was built as a joint undertaking by the New Jersey State Highway Commission, the city of Trenton and Mercer County; it opened in January 1932. New roads built were the Brunswick Circle Extension and the northeast part of Calhoun Street; the rest of Calhoun Street and Princeton Avenue existed before the road was built. Princeton Avenue was already maintained by the county; the rest was taken over by the state.

The road was intended as a bypass of Downtown Trenton for cars and light trucks; the Calhoun Street Bridge had and still has a low weight limit. It may have been part of Route 26, which continued north from Brunswick Circle. On the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River, the road from the bridge rejoined the Lincoln Highway to Philadelphia at Fallsington. On the New Jersey side, the Lincoln Highway ran through Brunswick Circle, and the new Route 26 to New Brunswick, built in 1930, began at the Circle.

In the 1950s, it was numbered as part of County Route 583 except along the Brunswick Circle Extension; it now has the following numbers:
*County Route 653 along Calhoun Street
*County Route 583 and southbound U.S. Route 206 (also signed as southbound U.S. Route 1 Business) along Princeton Avenue
*County Route 645 (also signed as southbound US 206 and Business US 1; US 206 southbound officially stays with Princeton Avenue and Business US 1 southbound isn&#x27;t officially there) along Brunswick Circle Extension. 
The Extension has been supplanted by U.S. Route 1, which also connects Brunswick Circle to the Delaware River.

<text>Omar Abdullah (born 10 March 1970) is an Indian politician who is currently serving as the chief minister of union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. He had previously served as the chief minister of the Jammu and Kashmir between 2009 and 2014, and is the current vice president of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, a position he has held since 2009 and also previously served as its president. Abdullah also served as a member of parliament in the Lok Sabha from 1998 to 2009, representing the Srinagar parliamentary constituency, and was a union minister of State for External Affairs.

The son of former Jammu and Kashmir state chief minister Farooq Abdullah, he joined politics in 1998 after being elected as the youngest member of the Lok Sabha, a feat he repeated in subsequent three elections. He was the union minister of State for External Affairs in Atal Bihari Vajpayee&#x27;s NDA government, from 23 July 2001 to 23 December 2002. He resigned from NDA government in October 2002 to concentrate on party work. During this time, he took a larger role in state politics. However, his party faced defeat in the 2002 state elections. However, him and his party were later elected in the 2008 state elections.

He became the youngest, and 11th chief minister of the state of Jammu and Kashmir after forming a government in coalition with the Indian National Congress, on 5 January 2009. He would serve in that position until 2015, after being defeated in the 2014 state elections. He was the last leader of opposition in the erstwhile state Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly, serving as an MLA from Beerwah constituency, before the assembly was dissolved in 2018 and the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir ceased to exist as on 6 August 2019 and became a union territory following the revocation of Article 370, which Abdullah fiercely opposed.

Following being arrested and detained in 2020, Abdullah returned to politics first in the 2024 Indian general election, where he was defeated for a seat. Despite initially refusing to run for a seat, Abdullah was elected as an MLA following the 2024 union territory elections, being elected the first chief minister of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in alliance with the INDIA bloc. He took office in October 2024.

==Personal life==
Omar Abdullah was born on 10 March 1970 in Rochford, Essex, United Kingdom. He is a grandson of Sheikh Abdullah, and the only son of Farooq Abdullah, a physician and former Chief Minister of J&amp;K. All three men have held the position of Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. His mother, Mollie, an Englishwoman and a nurse by profession, has said that she was not in favor of him joining politics. He studied at the Burn Hall School located at Sonwar Bagh, Srinagar and then at Lawrence School, Sanawar. He is a B.Com. graduate of Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics. He was employed with ITC Limited and The Oberoi Group till the age of 29 before entering politics. He did commence an MBA with the University of Strathclyde, however due to his election to the Lok Sabha, he dropped out from the course.

He is married to Payal Nath. She is the daughter of a retired army officer, Ram Nath. In September 2011, Omar confirmed that he and his wife have separated but their divorce is still pending in courts. His younger sister, Sara, was married to Sachin Pilot, son of Rajesh Pilot whose divorced news has come recently.

He had a role in director Apoorva Lakhia’s film, &quot;Mission Istanbul&quot; (2008) playing himself.

==Political career==
In 1998, at the age of 28, Omar Abdullah was elected to the 12th Lok Sabha, becoming the youngest member. In 1998–99, he was a member of both the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Ministry of Tourism&#x27;s Consultative Committee. In 1999, he was elected to 13th Lok Sabha (2nd term as a Member of Parliament). On 13 October 1999, he took oath as Union Minister of State, Commerce and Industry. On 22 July 2001, he became the youngest Union Minister, when he was made Union Minister of State for External Affairs. He resigned from the post on 23 December 2002, to concentrate on party work.

On 23 June 2002, he became the President of the National Conference party, replacing his father, Farooq Abdullah. He lost his Ganderbal seat in the Kashmir assembly elections held in September–October 2002. Abdullah was re-elected as the National Conference party&#x27;s president in 2006.

In March 2006, much to the disapproval of the centre Omar Abdullah had a one-on-one meeting with Pakistan&#x27;s president, Pervez Musharraf, in Islamabad. This was the first meeting of its kind between a mainstream politician from Jammu &amp; Kashmir and the Pakistani government, thereby re-enforcing Omar&#x27;s growing commitment to the solution of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir cause.

On 22 July 2008, Omar gave a speech during the 2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence, which was praised and won him fans on the internet. 
&quot;I am a Muslim and I am an Indian, and I see no distinction between the two. I don&#x27;t know why should I fear the nuclear deal. It is a deal between two countries which, I hope, will become two equals in the future. The enemies of Indian Muslims are not America or deals like these. The enemies are the same as the enemies of all those who are poor—poverty, hunger, lack of development and the absence of a voice&quot;. On 6 February 2020 the government of India booked him under the Public Safety Act (PSA) which was revoked on 24 March 2020.

Mr. Abdullah has been appointed a member of the Coordination Committee of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance at its Mumbai convention on 1 September 2023. The coordination committee will decide the national agenda, common campaign issues and common program of the country&#x27;s main opposition alliance (I.N.D.I.A.).

In the 2024 Lok Sabha Election Omar Abdullah was defeated by Engineer Sheikh Abdul Rashid. In run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Omar Abdullah showed unwillingness to go for a seat sharing agreement with other political parties under the INDIA alliance in Jammu and Kashmir, and insisted on NC contesting all seats in Kashmir region. He won both of his assembly seats from Budgam Assembly constituency and Ganderbal Assembly constituency and later withdrew his Budgam seat and retained Ganderbal seat.

==Chief Ministership==

After the 2008 Kashmir Elections, the National Conference won the largest number of seats, and formed a coalition government with the Congress party, and Omar was sworn in as the 11th Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir on 5 January 2009 at the General Zoravar Singh Auditorium in the University of Jammu, Jammu, raising hope amongst the people of Jammu and Kashmir who had been reeling under insurgency and violence caused by cross border terrorism since 1989.

In 2009, Omar Abdullah was accused of covering up the rape and murder of two young women in Shopian. Many regarded this as Abdullah&#x27;s first failure, as even moderates felt Abdullah had bowed to pressure from New Delhi.
At the 2024 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, Abdullah&#x27;s Jammu and Kashmir National Conference and its allies alliance secured 49 seats allowing him to be nominated to be the new Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. Omar Abdullah met with the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Manoj Sinha, on 11 October was sworn in as Chief Minister on 16 October 2024.

==Detention==
On the intervening night of 4 and 5 August 2019, Omar Abdullah was placed under preventive detention by the Indian Government under Section 107 of the CRPC. This came as a backdrop to the government&#x27;s decision of scrapping Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which gave the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir semi-autonomous powers.

After the expiry of the six-month detention without any charges, Abdullah was again charged and detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA) which was later revoked on 24 March 2020.

&quot;The capacity of the subject to influence people for any cause can be gauged from the fact that he was able to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers even during peak of militancy and poll boycotts,&quot; the government dossier continues.

Abdullah&#x27;s sister, Sara Abdullah Pilot has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging Abdullah&#x27;s detention calling it &quot;wholly antithetical to a democratic polity and undermines the Indian Constitution&quot; and asking that the SC secure Abdullah&#x27;s release.

The petition also includes a habeas corpus for Abdullah to be produced before the Supreme Court.

On 10 February 2020, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Sara Abdullah Pilot, mentioned the matter for urgent listing before a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana.

On 14 February 2020, the Supreme Court issued notice to the Jammu &amp; Kashmir administration and set the next date of hearing as 2 March 2020.

On 24 March 2020, Omar Abdullah was released from detention. Following his release, he demanded other people held under detention be released as well.

<doc id="1304167" wikidata="Q642906" url="?curid=1304167" title="Ayu sweetfish">
<text>The ayu sweetfish (Plecoglossus altivelis), or sweetfish, is a species of fish. It is the only species in the genus &quot;Plecoglossus&quot; and family Plecoglossidae. It is a relative of the smelts and other fish in the order Osmeriformes.

Native to East Asia, it is distributed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean along the coast of Hokkaidō in Japan southward to the Korean Peninsula, China, Hong Kong and northern Vietnam. It is amphidromous, moving between coastal marine waters and freshwater lakes and rivers. A few landlocked populations also exist in lakes in Japan such as Biwa. Original wild populations in Taiwan became extinct in 1968 due to pollution and present extant populations were reintroduced from Japan in the 1990s.

The name &quot;sweetfish&quot; was inspired by the sweetness of its flesh. In reference to its typical one-year lifespan, it is also written as (&quot;year-fish&quot;). Some individuals live two to three years. The ayu is the prefectural fish of Gunma Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture.

==Subspecies==
Two to three subspecies are recognized by some authors. Others do not distinguish the subtaxa.

Subspecies include:
* &quot;P. a. altivelis&quot; (ayu, sweetfish)
* &quot;P. a. chinensis&quot; (Chinese ayu)
* &quot;P. a. ryukyuensis&quot; (Ryukyu ayu-fish) – endangered

==Biology==
An omnivore, the ayu feeds on algae, crustaceans, insects, sponges, and worms. It feeds on algae that accumulates on the rocks, scraping it off the rocks with their saw-shaped teeth. Adults typically maintain a feeding territory, but the form restricted to lakes and associated streams is schooling.Most populations of this species are amphidromous and breed in the lower part of rivers during the autumn, laying their eggs in small pits they dig in the gravel. The eggs hatch shortly after and the larvae are carried downriver to the sea. They overwinter in coastal regions, staying there until the spring where the young fish typically are about long and move back to the rivers. Here they reach by the summer. They reach maturity by the autumn and move down to the lower part of rivers to breed. Some die after breeding and only live one year, but others return to live in the ocean and may spawn up to three times, each time moving into the lower part of rivers in the autumn. In Japan, some populations live their entire life in freshwater, only moving between lakes and the associated streams where they breed. These have a more variable migration pattern, moving upstream from the lakes in the spring, summer or autumn. Although their larvae mostly stay within freshwater, some are carried downstream with the current to the sea and become part of the amphidromous populations. The freshwater-restricted populations typically reach an age of two or three years. During the breeding season the amphidromous and freshwater-restricted forms may occur together. Ayu are also stocked in reservoirs.

Although there are reports of ayu up to long, a more typical maximum size for the species is about . The form restricted to freshwater is considerably smaller than the amphidromous form. The freshwater-restricted ayu of Lake Biwa that migrate into their spawning streams in the spring can reach up to about in length, but those that migrate later in the year, primarily in the autumn, only grow to . This is caused by differences in the availability of food.

==Human uses==

Ayu is an edible fish, mostly consumed in East Asia. Its flesh has a distinctive, sweet flavour with &quot;melon and cucumber aromas&quot;. It is consequently highly prized as a food fish. The main methods for obtaining ayu are by means of fly fishing, by using a fish trap, and by fishing with a decoy which is known as &quot;ayu-no-tomozuri&quot; in Japan. The decoy is a living ayu placed on a hook, which swims when immersed into water. It provokes the territorial behavior of other ayu, which assault the &quot;intruder&quot; and get caught.

Japanese fishers also catch it using cormorant fishing. On the Nagara River where Japanese cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax capillatus&quot;) are used by the fishermen, the fishing season draws visitors from all over the world. The Japanese cormorants, known in Japanese as &quot;umi-u&quot; (ウミウ, &quot;sea-cormorant&quot;), are domesticated birds trained for this purpose. The bird catches the ayu, stores it in its crop, and delivers it to the fishermen.

Ayu is also fished commercially, and captive juveniles are raised in aquaculture before being released into rivers for sport fishing.

A common method of preparing ayu and other small fish in Japan is to skewer it in such a way so that its body forms a wave, making it look as though it is swimming.

<text>Museum is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It opened in 1963 and is located under Queen&#x27;s Park at Charles Street West, beside the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) after which it is named.

==Structure==

The station structure was created in the middle of the road using cut and cover, while immediately south of the station the line goes into a bored tunnel to run under Queen&#x27;s Park, passing east of the Ontario Legislative Building to reach Queen&#x27;s Park station. The concourse is located under the roadway, one level above the north end of a centre platform, with entrances from either side of the road. There are two stairways on the west side adjacent to the southern end of the Royal Ontario Museum and two on the east, just south of Charles Street. Pedestrians are encouraged to use the station as a pedestrian underpass to cross Queen&#x27;s Park, a wide and busy thoroughfare without a centre median. There is also a stairway from Queens Park leading directly to the southern end of the subway platform. This station does not yet have an elevator and is not wheelchair accessible.

When plans for the adjacent and now closed McLaughlin Planetarium were drawn up in the mid-1960s, a tunnel that would lead directly to the Planetarium was contemplated, but this plan was scrapped as being too expensive.

===Connection to Line 2 Bloor–Danforth===
 and stations each have four parallel tracks, two above two. Between these stations and Museum is a full double-track, grade-separated wye junction. The tracks to/from Museum connect to the upper St. George and Lower Bay stations, while the tracks along Bloor use lower St. George and upper Bay.

The decision by Metro Council in 1960 to build a wye from the University line to the eastbound Bloor line between Museum and Bay stations was a controversial one. TTC Chairman Clarence Downey opposed the construction, estimated to cost about $10 million, saying that $10 million would build an extra mile of subway on the Bloor–Danforth line. The construction was estimated to cost $3 million for the basic interchange, and $7 million for the “intricate trackage system”.

From February to September 1966, all three sides of the wye were used in regular service: from each of three terminals—, , and —trains ran alternately to the other two (between Eglinton and Museum via ). Thereafter, Line 2 Bloor–Danforth became a separate route, Lower Bay was closed, and upper St. George became a terminus for the Yonge–University line until it was extended to in 1978. The tunnel to Lower Bay is visible from northbound trains shortly after they leave Museum Station.

==Station access upgrades==
In August 2022, construction started on a second entrance via an exterior staircase at the south end of Museum station; it was opened in May 2024. The staircase is located at the north end of Queens Park Circle on the south side of the War Memorial monument. It leads down to platform-level turnstiles, located at the site of a former storage space. For station accessibility, there will also be an entrance via elevator to a new concourse level providing access to a second elevator to the platform level; these changes were expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2026.

==Architecture and art==

The station opened with the same tile scheme which would become standard on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, whose first phase was completed three years later in 1966. Smooth, unadorned cream-coloured rectangular tiles were predominant, with a strip of narrower blue tiles near the ceiling. The unique Toronto subway typeface was used for the station name, sandblasted into the wall and painted in the same shade of blue as the narrower strip of tiles.

In April 2008, a major renovation by Diamond and Schmitt Architects and Jeviso Construction Corporation transformed the platform level to mirror exhibits in the Royal Ontario Museum. This renovation replaced the original tile scheme. Supporting columns were redesigned to evoke various historical and cultural figures, including the Egyptian deity Osiris, Toltec warriors, Doric columns, Forbidden City columns, and Indigenous Northwest Coast house posts. The walls were reclad with mauve aluminum panels by Ontario Panelization, which incorporated painted 1/4&quot; fire-rated Lexan into the panels composing the large &quot;MUSEUM&quot; lettering on the walls with a historical hieroglyphic inscription from the ROM.
==Nearby landmarks==
In addition to its proximity to the Royal Ontario Museum, other landmarks nearby include the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art, The Royal Conservatory of Music, the defunct McLaughlin Planetarium, and the northeast corner of the University of Toronto (which includes Trinity College, Victoria University, St. Michael&#x27;s College, the Faculty of Law, and the Faculty of Music).

<doc id="1304171" wikidata="Q6544906" url="?curid=1304171" title="Life Is a Highway">
<text>&quot;Life Is a Highway&quot; is a song by Canadian musician Tom Cochrane from his second studio album, &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; (1991). The song became a number-one hit in Canada in late 1991. &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot; also peaked at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in August 1992 and reached the top two in Australia and New Zealand the same year. The song was covered by Chris LeDoux for his 1998 album &quot;One Road Man&quot; and Rascal Flatts in 2006 for the &quot;Cars&quot; soundtrack.

==Background and release==
Cochrane has stated that &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot; was originally conceived in the 1970s as &quot;Love Is a Highway&quot; while he was still a member of Red Rider, but was shelved at that time because he felt the unfinished song was unusable. Following a trip with his family to eastern Africa with the World Vision famine relief organization, Cochrane revisited the song on the advice of his friend John Webster, an instrumentalist on the &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; album. In a 2017 interview with The Canadian Press to mark the song&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Cochrane said Webster encouraged him to revisit the demo recording, which at that point only had mumbled vocals and improvised lyrics, but not the song&#x27;s well-known chorus. &quot;(The song) became a pep talk to myself... saying you can&#x27;t really control all of this stuff, you just do the best you can,&quot; he says. Cochrane says he was trying to make sense of the poverty he witnessed on his trip, which he found &quot;shocking and traumatic&quot;.

Eventually, the original demo version was released on the 25th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; under the original title &quot;Love Is a Highway&quot;. He later said the up-tempo spirit of the song came from looking for something positive to &quot;hang the experience on.&quot; Most of the vocals on the track were recorded in Cochrane&#x27;s small home studio. The song was Cochrane&#x27;s only top-40 hit in the United States, reaching number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Canada, the song stayed at number one for two weeks, and three other singles from the album charted within the top 10; &quot;No Regrets&quot; peaked at number three, &quot;Sinking Like a Sunset&quot; reached number two, and &quot;Washed Away&quot; climbed to number seven. In Australia and New Zealand, the single peaked at number two in both countries. Elsewhere, it became a top-40 hit in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

==Music video==
The video for &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot; was directed by David Storey and produced by Albert Botha, who went on to be the line producer on two films for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;: &quot;Superstar&quot; starring Molly Shannon and &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; starring Tim Meadows. The video was shot in Alberta&#x27;s Badlands, near the town of Drumheller. Many of the shots are in familiar locations along the Dinosaur Trail, including Cochrane playing guitar amid the Hoodoos and the couple, Kait Shane and Brennan Elliott, running around the car while it rides the Bleriot Ferry across the Red Deer River. It also features an older man (gas station attendant), a couple (tall man, short wife), two women (Jacqueline and Joyce Robbins) from an Anabaptist religious order (Alberta has a population of Hutterites), and two First Nations men, one wearing a baseball cap with the words &quot;Oka Standoff&quot; printed on it, referring to the Oka Crisis (a land dispute between a group of Mohawk people and the town of Oka, Quebec). The car featured in the music video is a 1965 Chevrolet Impala Super Sport.

==Release history==
==Chris LeDoux version==

In 1998, Chris LeDoux covered &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot; for his album &quot;One Road Man&quot;. Changes include the intro, timing of vocal entrances on the chorus, and location names between the first and second chorus. LeDoux&#x27;s version was released as a single the following year and peaked at number 64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart during the week of June 12, 1999, and remained at the spot for nine weeks.

===Music video===
The music video for the song, directed by Michael Salomon, takes place on multiple roads and highways as well as a blue and red static themed room. When on roads and highways, there is a chance for LeDoux to appear on a television that is sitting on a sidewalk or grass, however, while the background behind LeDoux (that appears on the TV) is the same background as everything behind the TV itself, LeDoux does not appear to be standing behind the TV. In most locations, LeDoux is walking down a road as at the start of the music video. The video ends with LeDoux singing the chorus while appearing on a flap-down TV inside of someone&#x27;s car, then transitioning to LeDoux being once again in the static room and then walking out of it. After LeDoux leaves the room, the screen slowly fades to black and the video ends.

==Rascal Flatts version==

In 2005, American country band Rascal Flatts recorded a cover of the song for the Pixar animated film &quot;Cars&quot;, which was released on June 9, 2006. The song sold a large quantity of digital downloads, leading to a number seven peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (one position lower than Cochrane&#x27;s original version). In addition, the cover was placed as a bonus track on later versions of the album &quot;Me and My Gang&quot;, and also was included on &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 1&quot; (2008) and &quot;Twenty Years of Rascal Flatts: The Greatest Hits&quot; (2020). This version also won the &quot;Favorite Song from a Movie&quot; &amp; &quot;Favorite Remake&quot; award at the 33rd People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

The instrumental of the Rascal Flatts&#x27; cover version was prominently featured in the &quot;Top Gear: US Special&quot;, which aired February 11, 2007. The song is included on the soundtrack for &quot;Cars Mater-National Championship&quot; and &quot;Lego Rock Band&quot;. It topped the two million mark in paid downloads as of the chart dated March 28, 2009. As of March 2013, the song has sold over three million copies in the US. On July 14, 2015, Scott Walker, Republican Governor of Wisconsin, launched his presidential campaign as Republican Party nominee in Waukesha, Wisconsin using the song. On December 8, 2020, Harmonix announced that the cover would be featured on the video game, FUSER, as a DLC on December 10, 2020. The song is also featured in video games such as &quot;Cars: Mater-National&quot; and &quot;Rocket League&quot;.

===Music video===
The music video portrays the three band members pulling into a drive-in theater driving three vintage vehicles. The cars allude to three characters from &quot;Cars&quot;: Lightning McQueen, Doc Hudson and Mater. As the projector rolls, scenes from the film are shown as the band plays through the number. It was directed by Shaun Silva.

===Charts===
The Rascal Flatts version subsequently became a hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at number seven. Even though it was not officially released to country radio, many country stations played the song as an album cut, overlapping with their then-current country single &quot;My Wish&quot;. The unsolicited country airplay brought &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot; to number 18 on the US Hot Country Songs chart. The song has sold 3.4 million copies in the US as of June 2016.

==Early life==
Walter graduated from St. Charles Preparatory School in Columbus, Ohio, and received a B.A. degree from Ohio University in 1967. Walter later attended Harvard Business School, where he received an MBA.

==Career==
In 1971, he founded Cardinal Foods after purchasing Monarch Foods, a small Ohio food wholesaler. In less than a decade his company became a regional food distributor. In 1979, the company acquired Bailey Drug Company and began wholesaling drugs. He renamed the company Cardinal Health. By 1983, the company went public and, under Walter&#x27;s direction, achieved $1 billion in revenue in 1991.

In subsequent years, the company experienced extraordinary growth, &quot;one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight.&quot; Cardinal Health is now a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals, health &amp; beauty products, and hospital supplies in the United States. In 2007, he was #14 on &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 25 top-paid male executives, with total compensation of $42.7 million the previous year. He retired from Cardinal Health at the end of the 2008 fiscal year.

In 2016, after serving on the board since 2006, he was named non-executive chairman of Louisville based Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Walter previously served as a director of American Express, Nordstrom, CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse.

==Personal life==
He is married to Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Walter, who also attended Ohio University. The Walters have given support to the Ohio University community including Margaret Walter Hall, and to the Columbus Museum of Art, where they donated $10,000,000, the largest gift in the Museum’s history, in 2015. Walter resides in Dublin, Ohio; Boca Raton, Florida; and Park City, Utah.

<text>Edwin Howland Blashfield (December 5, 1848October 12, 1936) was an American painter and muralist, most known for painting the murals on the dome of the Library of Congress Main Reading Room in Washington, DC.

== Biography ==
Blashfield was born in Brooklyn in 1848 to William H. Blashfield and Eliza Dodd. He studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts after initial coursework in engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He moved to Europe in 1867 to study with Léon Joseph Florentin Bonnat in Paris and remained abroad until 1881, traveling, painting, and exhibiting his work in salon shows. His academic background in painting and extensive travels in Italy to study fresco painting melded in work marked by delicacy and beauty of coloring. Following his early success as a genre painter, Blashfield became a widely admired muralist whose work ornamented the dome of the Manufacturers&#x27; and Liberal Arts building at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, in Chicago, several state capitols, and the central dome of the Library of Congress.

Edwin Blashfield designed the 1896 two-dollar note. The mural on the obverse features Science presenting Steam and Electricity. Science is seated with two boys. The figures of Steam and Electricity are represented by the children and Commerce and Manufacture are portrayed by the two adults. The reverse of the note features portraits of inventors Robert Fulton and Samuel Morse. 

He was a member of numerous arts organizations, including the National Academy of Design, the National Society of Mural Painters in which he served as President from 1909 to 1914. American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Blashfield served from 1920 to 1926 as President of the National Academy of Design. Among his many honors, Blashfield was awarded a Gold Medal by the National Academy of Design in 1934, an honorary membership in the American Institute of Architects, and an honorary doctorate of fine arts by New York University in 1926. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1912 to 1916. His circle of friends included sculptor Daniel Chester French, painters John Singer Sargent and Maxfield Parrish, and architect Cass Gilbert. His style was influenced by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Jean-Paul Laurens, and Paul Baudry. He married Evangeline Wilbour in 1881 and together they wrote &quot;Italian Cities&quot; (1900) and translated Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Painters&quot; (4 vols., 1897). Wilbour died in 1918 and Blashfield married Grace Hall in 1928. He became president of the Society of Mural Painters, and of the Society of American Artists. Blashfield died in 1936 at his summer home on Cape Cod and is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

<doc id="1304175" wikidata="Q5330225" url="?curid=1304175" title="Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association">
<text>The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) is an NCAA Division I collegiate wrestling conference. It held its first championship tournament in 1905, making it the oldest wrestling conference in the NCAA. The EIWA&#x27;s charter members were Columbia, Penn, Princeton, and Yale. Thirty-three different schools have been members of the EIWA during its history, all schools from the Eastern United States. Its current members are schools in the Northeast whose main conferences do not sponsor wrestling, including the Patriot League, America East Conference, Northeast Conference, Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, and Coastal Athletic Association. Franklin &amp; Marshall College is the only Division III school that competes in Division I wrestling.

==Current members==
The EIWA currently has 12 members:

* American University
* United States Military Academy (Army)
* Binghamton University
* Bucknell University
* Drexel University
* Franklin and Marshall College
* Hofstra University
* Lehigh University
* Long Island University
* Morgan State University
* United States Naval Academy (Navy)
* Sacred Heart University
== Recent success and developments==
At the 2011 NCAA Wrestling Championship, three EIWA teams placed in the top 10: Cornell placed 2nd, American University placed 5th, and Lehigh University placed 8th. In 2012, Cornell finished 4th and Lehigh 8th; Cornell was also 5th in 2013 and 7th in 2014.

In the same period, the EIWA had forty-four All-Americans; also, Kyle Dake of Cornell was awarded the Dan Hodge Trophy as national wrestler of the year and was named most outstanding wrestler of the NCAA tournament after becoming the first NCAA wrestler ever to win four national championships in four different weight classes in consecutive years.

In 2013, the EIWA absorbed Boston University, Hofstra, Drexel, and Binghamton after the Colonial Athletic Association ceased sponsorship of wrestling, making an 18-team conference for the 2013–14 season. The EIWA was reduced to 16 in 2014-15 with the departure of Rutgers to the Big Ten Conference and discontinuation of the BU program.

The most recent change in the EIWA membership was announced in April 2019. Long Island University announced that the wrestling team that had represented its Post campus in Division II would join the EIWA once the merger of the athletic programs of its Brooklyn and Post campuses took effect in July 2019. The renamed LIU Sharks joined NEC rival Sacred Heart, bringing the conference to seventeen members.

For the 2020–21 season, the EIWA had ten schools competing, as the six Ivy League schools and the Centennial Conference (which includes Franklin &amp; Marshall) did not hold winter sports due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On December 19, 2023, the six Ivy League members announced that they were leaving the EIWA to compete exclusively under the Ivy League banner starting in the 2024–25 season.

On September 19, 2024, Morgan State University, a program that resumed competition in 2023 after a 26-year hiatus and the lone Division I HBCU wrestling program, joined the EIWA. Morgan State is the first HBCU to join the EIWA.

<doc id="1304177" wikidata="Q743568" url="?curid=1304177" title="Braj Kumar Nehru">
<text>Braj Kumar Nehru MBE, ICS (4 September 1909 – 31 October 2001) was an Indian diplomat and Ambassador of India to the United States (1961–1968).

He was the son of Brijlal Nehru and Rameshwari Nehru and the first cousin of India&#x27;s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

== Personal life ==
Braj Kumar Nehru was born in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India and was son of Brijlal Nehru and Rameshwari Nehru. He was educated at the Allahabad University (India), the London School of Economics and at Oxford University. He was awarded the Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Punjab, for his distinguished services in various fields. His grandfather, Pandit Nandlal Nehru, was the elder brother of Pandit Motilal Nehru. He was the cousin to the erstwhile Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi (née Nehru). In 1935, Nehru married Magdolna Friedman (5 December 1908, Budapest, Austria-Hungary - 25 April 2017, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, India), a fellow student in the UK who was of a Hungarian Jewish background. The ill-treatment of the Jewish community in Europe prompted her father to change her name to Magdolna Forbath. Her nickname was Fori. After marriage, she changed her name to Shobha Nehru.

== Career ==

=== National ===
He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1934 and rose to be governor of seven different states of India. From 1934 to 1937 he held various government positions in the province of Punjab. Nehru became the secretary of economic affairs in 1957. He was appointed Commissioner General for Economic Affairs (external financial relations) of India in 1958. He was Governor of Jammu and Kashmir (1981–84), Assam (1968–73), Gujarat (1984–86), Nagaland (1968–73), Meghalaya (1970–73), Manipur (1972–73) and Tripura (1972–73). He was transferred overnight as the Governor of Jammu &amp; Kashmir to Gujarat after he refused to help Indira Gandhi in destabilising the Farooq Abdullah government.

=== International ===

Nehru worked as executive director in the World Bank (1949) and was Economic Minister at the Indian Embassy in Washington (1954). He helped to create the &quot;Aid India Club&quot; in 1958, which was a consortium of donor nations that committed to donate $2 million for the development of India. He also served as a diplomat, as ambassador to several countries and was offered the post of secretary-general of the United Nations in 1951, but declined. Nehru was also the Indian High Commissioner in London from 1973 to 1977. Braj was chairman of the United Nations Investment committee for 14 years. He represented India in the &#x27;Sterlings balances&#x27; negotiations with Britain at the post-Second World War reparations conference.

=== Writer ===

Nehru wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Nice Guys Finish Second&quot;. Mr. Ramesh Kumar Saxena, who worked for him for 35 years, helped writing his biography.

== Awards ==
He was appointed an MBE in the 1945 New Year Honours. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1999.

The speech &quot;Civil Service in Transition&quot; delivered at the India International Center in New Delhi on 15 October 1999 describes the need and the role played by a strong civil service. It also details the causes for the prevalent corruption in India&#x27;s political system and civil services.

== Death ==
Nehru died in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, India on 31 October 2001 at the age of 92. His body was cremated in Delhi and a memorial service was held amongst the chanting of &quot;mantras&quot; from the holy scriptures.

<doc id="1304180" wikidata="Q1040665" url="?curid=1304180" title="Queen's Park station (Toronto)">
<text>Queen&#x27;s Park is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station, which opened in 1963, is located under University Avenue at College Street.

The station is wheelchair-accessible and has had underground connections to adjoining buildings since 2002. Wi-Fi service is available at this station.

== Entrances ==
The mezzanine level of the station is located under the intersection of College Street and University Avenue/Queens Park and entrances are located at all four corners. 
* Northwest entrance: The only uncovered stairwell entrance is located beside the Leslie L. Dan Pharmacy Building at the southeast corner of the University of Toronto lands.
* Northeast entrance: This is where the elevator between ground level and the ticketing mezzanine is situated. A different elevator provides further access to the train platform. There is a tunnel here connecting to the Ontario Government Buildings and other important destinations include the Ontario Legislative Building and Women&#x27;s College Hospital.
* Southwest entrance: Twin escalators provide a direct connection to the Intact Centre, with Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Mount Sinai Hospital and the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute being on the west side of University Avenue to the south.
* Southeast entrance: Beside this entrance is the MaRS Discovery District, where a connecting tunnel is to be constructed, and a short distance to the south are Toronto General Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children.

==Architecture and art==

The station is in a bored tunnel, and it is one of only two stations in the system to have a tubular shape, the other being the next station south at St. Patrick. North of the station, the tunnel curves east around the Ontario Legislative Building, then comes back to its original alignment centred under the road just before Museum Station

A ceramic tile mural, a gift from the Government of Portugal, is located within the fare-paid area of the mezzanine. The mural features subject matter inspired by Portuguese exploration of the New World. It was designed by Ana Vilela, manufactured by Viúva Lamego in Lisbon and installed here in 2003.
==Station improvements==

 further renovations at the station have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2023, including asbestos removal and cosmetic upgrades such as new wall finishes. Some riders have expressed frustration with the station&#x27;s safety and appearance due to a lack of proper wayfinding signage and missing tiles.

==Surface connections==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:

The station, which opened in 1963, is named for the nearby St. Patrick&#x27;s Church. It is one of only two stations in the system to have a tubular shape created by the tunnel boring machine, the other such station being Queen&#x27;s Park, the next station to the north.

The murder of Mariam Peters here in 1975 prompted the TTC to adopt system-wide safety measures such as the first police patrols on the subway and the installation of emergency telephones and alarms. One of the three cross passages was blocked off, as well as at Queen&#x27;s Park station, to prevent it being used as a hiding spot for criminals.
==Nearby landmarks==
The Canadian Airman&#x27;s Memorial was erected in the median of University Avenue above the station in 1984. &lt;br&gt;Nearby landmarks include St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, The Michener Institute, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Consulate General of the United States, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Textile Museum of Canada, the Ontario College of Art and Design, and the Hospital for Sick Children. It is also within a very short walking distance, west along Dundas Street, to the original Chinatown.

== Surface connections ==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:

TTC routes serving the station include:
==Station improvements==
St. Patrick Station was listed on the Toronto Community Foundation&#x27;s list of stations which they expressed interest in donating funds for platform level appearance improvements. The organization successfully raised funds and designed the renovations of Museum station.

As part of its Easier Access Program, the TTC added two new elevators, one from a new street level entrance to the concourse level, and a second from the concourse to the platform level. Construction started in late 2017 and renovations were fully completed by December 4, 2018. A ceremony was held on March 5, 2019, to officially celebrate St. Patrick as the 45th accessible TTC subway station.

Station enhancements also included the artwork titled &quot;Many Little Plans&quot; by artist Barbara Todd. The artwork consists of over 400 ceramic tiles and is installed in alcoves at the platform level.
 further renovations at the station have been ongoing since the fourth quarter of 2023, including asbestos removal and cosmetic upgrades such as new wall finishes. Some riders have expressed frustration with the station&#x27;s safety and appearance due to a lack of proper wayfinding signage and missing tiles.

<text>Warburg Pincus LLC is a global private equity firm, headquartered in New York City, with offices in the United States, Europe, Brazil, China, Southeast Asia and India. Warburg has been a private equity investor since 1966. As of April 2024 the firm had over $90 billion in assets under management and invests in a range of sectors including retail, industrial manufacturing, energy, financial services, health care, technology, media, and real estate. Warburg Pincus is a growth investor. Warburg Pincus has raised 21 private equity funds which have invested over $100 billion in over 1,000 companies in 40 countries. 

In June 2024, Warburg Pincus was ranked ninth in Private Equity International&#x27;s PEI 300 ranking of the largest private equity firms in the world.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
In 1939, Eric Warburg of the Warburg banking family founded a company under the name E.M. Warburg &amp; Co. Its first address was 52 William Street, New York, the Kuhn Loeb building. Throughout the early post-war period, the firm was a small office of 20 employees. In 1966, E.M. Warburg merged with Lionel I. Pincus &amp; Co, forming a new company that eventually became known as E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co. In 1965, when Eric Warburg retired to Germany, control was handed to Lionel Pincus, a partner in the Ladenburg Thalmann investment bank, and the working language of the office switched from German to English.

In 1967, Andres Fernandez Coronil, a former partner at Lazard Freres, joined Pincus to build the firm. Together they developed a strategy of investing in diversified companies of various sizes rather than focusing on start-ups. Pincus was the founder and chairman while Vogelstein was vice chairman and then president. Pincus and Vogelstein ran the company until 2002, when they stepped down and appointed Charles Kaye and Joseph P. Landy as co-presidents. Pincus died in 2009.

Warburg Pincus began investing in Europe in 1983 and opened its first office in Asia in 1994. It has invested more than $5 billion in Europe; more than $3 billion in India and more than $3.3 billion in China. The firm is headquartered in New York and has offices in Beijing, Berlin, Hong Kong, Houston, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, São Paulo, Shanghai and Singapore, with administrative offices in Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mauritius.

The firm is structured as a global partnership led by Chairman, Timothy Geithner, CEO, Charles R. &quot;Chip&quot; Kaye, and President, Jeffrey Perlman.

===Initial public offerings===
More than 140 Warburg Pincus companies have listed on exchanges, raising approximately $30 billion in public markets. In each of these IPOs, the firm was the principal financial investor in the portfolio company. The companies have listed on 13 exchanges, including at least 30 IPOs outside the U.S. In August 2010, a six-year partnership between management and Warburg Pincus led to MEG Energy&#x27;s successful IPO.

===Funds===
Warburg Pincus has a history of venture capital investing. The firm is a founding member of the venture capital associations in the U.S. and China, and offers a global entrepreneur in residence program to help start up new businesses.

In October 2014, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that Warburg Pincus had raised $4 billion for its first energy-focused private equity fund. In late 2018, Warburg Pincus closed its Warburg Pincus Global Growth, L.P. fund at $14.8 billion, and in June 2019, closed its Warburg Pincus China-Southeast Asia II, L.P. fund at $4.25 billion.

In April 2023, Warburg Pincus and ArchiMed agreed to sell the France-headquartered business Polyplus to life science group Sartorius for approximately €‎2.4 billion.

===Fight over the Warburg name===
During the post-war period, Eric Warburg vied with his cousin Siegmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg, over the use of the Warburg name in New York. Siegmund wished to expand the S.G. Warburg franchise into New York but was blocked by the existence of E.M. Warburg &amp; Co. Following the effective sale of the business to Pincus, Siegmund Warburg accused Eric of prostituting the Warburg name. &quot;Complicating matters was that Siegmund thought Pincus the wrong kind of Jew—of Eastern European ancestry, with a garment-district background. Professionally, he thought Pincus well below &quot;haute banque&quot; stature in the venture capital world.&quot;

In January 1970, Siegmund finally got the name changed to E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Company to differentiate it from S.G. Warburg &amp; Company. &quot;In the end, however, Lionel Pincus had the last laugh on Siegmund. He expanded Eric&#x27;s tiny firm into a giant, thriving business, with three and a half billion dollars of venture capital partnerships.&quot;

In 1999, they attempted to purchase English Premier League association football club Everton.

== Investment funds ==
== Acquisition, partnership and merger ==
Warburg Pincus invested in the information and communication technology sectors, including investments in Avaya, Bharti Tele-Ventures, Harbour Networks, NeuStar, PayScale, and Telcordia.

Warburg Pincus has invested in companies such as CityMD, The Summit Medical Group, Harbin Pharmaceutical, Venari Resources, NIO, ZTO Express in China and South East Asia, Bharti Telecommunications, Apollo Tyres Ltd, Ecom Express, SBI General Insurance in India, AmRest in Poland and Nuance Communications in the U.S. In 2019, the firm acquired a majority stake in healthcare tech company WebPT from Battery Ventures.

In May 2024, Warburg Pincus acquired Shriram Housing Finance at Rs 4,630 crore.

In August 2024, Warburg-Pincus said it will invest 50% each in Australian real estate company Lendris to establish a joint venture platform to focus on the Asia-Pacific region&#x27;s life science and R&amp;D real estate market.

In October 2024, Warburg Pincus invested $125 million in Contabilijay, Brazil&#x27;s leading accounting firm. The deal is Contabilijay&#x27;s largest shareholder, acquiring stakes from venture capital funds including Kajek, which has invested in Contabilijay since 2014.

In January 2025, Warburg Pincus entered into a $300 million strategic partnership with Mashra, a leading inventory intelligence platform in healthcare.

<doc id="1304192" wikidata="Q623080" url="?curid=1304192" title="Flowboard">
<text>A flowboard is a variation on a skateboard, combining aspects of surfing, skating and snowboarding. There are three sizes made by the brand Flowboards: 32&quot;, for tricks and smaller riders; 36&quot;, the standard size; and 42&quot;, the large downhill bomber.

==Concept==
The flowboard was created by Pieter Schouten and Mike Simonian, two design students attending the Art Center College of Design in Vevey, Switzerland. In 1993, they had the idea to develop a board that would perform like a snowboard, but on asphalt. They found that on a skateboard, a rider could only lean over a few degrees and then the bushings would give resistance in a turn. The two inventors sought a solution that would give a rider the ability to execute more extreme angles while carving without resistance, offering fluid transitions edge to edge. In 1994, Simonian asked Schouten to spend time developing their ideas in Simonian&#x27;s native California.

Schouten came up with a concept for a two-wheeled board with two curved axles with one wheel on each and springs on either side. The theory was that wheels would slide along the arced axles as the board leaned to carve. These &quot;arced axles&quot; became one of the key elements of the new board design. To allow the board to turn, the two men found that by mounting the axles at opposing angles, the wheels would go in a straight line when they were at the top of the arc and that when the wheels slid to either end of the arc they would have a curved relationship that would result in a turn. The &quot;angled axles&quot; would be the second key element of the new board design. The first prototype was produced in Simonian&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage on El Arco Drive in Whittier, California. This location became the namesake of the &quot;El Arco Axles&quot;.

==Company==
Numerous potential investors were approached including Powell Skateboards, Morey Boogie Board, pro-skater Rodney Mullen, Nike, Rollerblade and Mattel, but nothing developed from the discussions. In 1999, the two inventors formed Flowlab LLC alongside entrepreneur Phil Wessells. By the year 2000, the very first Flowboards were being shipped.

In 2003, Michael Kern (CEO of Sport Technology Inc.), then the company&#x27;s largest distributor, purchased the company and a new headquarters in Long Beach, California was established. In 2005, Flowlab signed an exclusive distribution agreement with the skate wheel manufacturer Kryptonics to further expand its presence in general sporting goods channels.

In 2007, Michael Kern took his Company Public with FBC Holding Co.. A division of Capital One Inc., and was shut down unlawfully and has been seeking action against FBC Holding Inc. and Capital One Inc. to the current date.

==Handling==
The flowboard&#x27;s design enables a 45 degree turning ability rather than the standard 25 degrees on a skateboard while still remaining stable.

A flowboard tends to put pressure on just 2 wheels of the board, rather than 4. This more focused weight distribution requires slightly more effort into keeping the board moving. For this reason, it is often ideal to ride it on downhill slopes. Spacers can also be installed to reduce bearing compression caused by the trucks&#x27; arched structure and improve mobility.

== History and construction ==

The station has an island platform and was constructed using the cut-and-cover method. There is a pocket track at the south end of the station which allows a southbound train to change direction.

When Osgoode was built, some utility lines were relocated away from the station to allow for a future &quot;Lower Osgoode&quot; station on the projected but never-built Queen Street subway, but unlike at Lower Queen, no actual construction took place. When it opened, Osgoode, like St. Andrew station, boasted Vitrolite tiles on its walls. Cracks resulting from the high water table at the station forced the TTC to cover over most of these tiles in the 1970s with vertical slats along the outer walls on the far side of the tracks and ceramic tiles on structural elements on the platform itself. In 2016, the slats on the outer walls were replaced by off-white panels, evoking the original design.
Entrances to the station were all built as open stairways from the sidewalk, with the panel above the lintel emblazoned with the scales of justice, which referenced the Superior Court of Justice at Osgoode Hall. Subsequent refurbishment resulted in a generic TTC style replacing the unique symbolism. In 2006, a new entrance, with elevator access to the concourse level, was integrated into the construction of the Four Seasons Centre, at the southeast corner of Queen and University. Along with an elevator to the platform level within the fare paid area, this made the station fully accessible as of 2007. Plans from 2008 call for Diamond and Schmitt Architects, who were responsible for the opera house, to design complementary covered entrances at the other three corners of the intersection.

== Future ==
Metrolinx plans to construct the Ontario Line, a rapid transit line connecting the south loop of Line 1 Yonge–University to the east wing of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth and north to Science Centre station, where the line will interchange with Line 5 Eglinton. The preferred route of the line is from Science Centre to Exhibition. Osgoode station is a planned station on this new line. The Ontario Line would be drilled out of rock at a lower level.

== Nearby landmarks ==
Nearby landmarks include the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, Toronto City Hall, Nathan Phillips Square, Osgoode Hall, the South African War Memorial, 299 Queen Street West, the Canada Life Building and the United States Consulate.

<text>Sir Brian Souter (born 5 May 1954) is a Scottish businessman. With his sister, Dame Ann Gloag, he founded the Stagecoach Group of bus and rail operators. He also founded the bus and coach operator Megabus, the train operating company South West Trains, his investments company Souter Holdings Ltd, and the Souter Charitable Trust.

Souter has been politically active in Scotland, and supported the Scottish National Party (SNP) financially. In 2000, when the Scottish Executive proposed to repeal Section 2A of the Local Government Act, which prevented local authorities from &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot;, Souter started the Keep the Clause campaign to oppose their plans, spending £1 million of his own money to organise a private referendum across Scotland. This campaign and other controversial statements have led opponents to accuse him of homophobia.

In 2011, he was knighted for services to transport and the voluntary sector. The honour was criticised by Scottish Labour Party politicians and by gay rights campaigners.

In October 2019, Souter announced the donation of 28% of the total shares in Souter Investments to charitable causes, with an estimated value of £109 million. This was described in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; as &quot;what could be the largest charitable donation by a Scot since ... Andrew Carnegie&quot;. This came after Souter&#x27;s charitable trust had already spent over £98 million supporting &quot;13,000 worthwhile causes&quot; over 13 years.

According to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2020, Souter and his sister Ann Gloag are worth £730 million, a decrease of £145 million from the previous year.

==Life and career==

===Childhood and education===

Souter was born in the Scottish city of Perth. His father was a bus driver and as a child Brian often travelled on bus routes with his father.
At school he developed an interest in economics and accounts, about which he later said, &quot;Changing my timetable from maths to include economics and accounts was one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

On leaving school, he studied at the Dundee Institute of Technology (which became Abertay University in 1994) to become a commerce teacher. On completion he studied at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, where he graduated with a CA Diploma in Accountancy and Economics. Following his graduation, Souter became a Chartered Accountant at Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.

===Stagecoach===

Using his father&#x27;s redundancy money, with his sister Ann Gloag and his brother-in-law Robin Gloag he established the Stagecoach Group in 1980, running buses from Dundee to London. Following the deregulation of bus services in Great Britain, expansion continued, and in the late 1980s Stagecoach acquired National Bus Company subsidiaries in Cumberland and Hampshire, and the East Midlands, Ribble, Southdown and United Counties companies. Stagecoach also bought bus operations in Scotland, Newcastle and London, with Manchester being added a few years later. In 1993, Stagecoach was valued at £134 million and was floated on the London Stock Exchange to access capital for new opportunities for buses and trains overseas.

By the mid-1990s, Stagecoach developed its interests in Australia and New Zealand. The company further expanded with the purchase of Citybus, an operator of buses and ferries in Hong Kong, and Coach USA.

Stagecoach then bought a number of the new small bus companies and ran free or low-fare buses to put local rivals out of business. In Darlington, Stagecoach subsidiary Busways offered bounties to recruit drivers from the existing bus service and offered free buses to deter the rival preferred bidder from taking over that service. This practice was deemed as &quot;predatory, deplorable and against the public interest&quot; according to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

In 2009, Souter received a £1.6 million bonus. Stating &quot;it was felt that in the present economic climate it would not be right for any individual to pocket a bonus package of £1.6million&quot;, he donated £900,000 to his own charity, the Souter Charitable Trust, which assists humanitarian projects in the UK and overseas. Most of the remainder was given to the staff pension fund.

In August 2012, it was announced that Souter would become chairman of Stagecoach Group on 1 May 2013, finance director Martin Griffiths replacing Souter as CEO. It was announced in December 2019 that Souter would step down from his role as chairman at the end of the year, but remain on the board as a non-executive director.

===Rail operations===

Shortly after Souter floated Stagecoach on the London Stock Exchange, he turned his attention to British railways. Initial experiments consisted of a Scotland to London service branded Stagecoach Rail with carriages attached to the &quot;Caledonian Sleeper&quot;. During the privatisation of British Rail, Stagecoach bid successfully to operate the South West Trains franchise from 1996 followed by the Island Line Trains later the same year. Stagecoach successfully bid to retain both when retendered in 2001 and 2006, before they passed to South Western Railway in 2017.

In 1998, Stagecoach purchased a 49% shareholding in Virgin Rail Group that operated the CrossCountry and West Coast franchises. In 2007, Stagecoach commenced operating the East Midlands Trains franchise. From April 2015 until June 2018, Virgin Trains East Coast, in which Stagecoach held a 90% share, operated the InterCity East Coast franchise.

===Megabus===

In 2003, Souter added the bus and coach operator Megabus to the group. With its slogan &quot;Low Cost Inter City Travel Serving Europe&quot;, it offered discounted travel across the UK and Europe. In 2012 it operated in 31 cities in the UK with a turnover in excess of £2 billion, with annual profits of over £250 million.

In April 2013 Souter announced a new Megabus overnight sleeper service from Scotland to London. The sleeper coaches cost £5 million to build, and have 53 leather seats which can be converted into 42 bunk beds. Passengers receive a onesie for sleeping in during the trip. This service ended in May 2017, due to it being consistently loss-making, and the coaches are now only used on daytime services.

===Souter Investments===

Souter has more than 200 private investments, which are managed by his company, Souter Investments. It makes investments across a broad range of asset classes, with a primary focus on private equity and a portfolio of more than 25 direct unquoted investments. The total portfolio, excluding Stagecoach, has increased in value by 9% per annum over 12 years.

====Highland Global Transport====

Souter and his sister Ann Gloag formed Highland Global Transport in 2012. It owns a portfolio of transport related investments valued at more than £600M including:
*Stagecoach Group (26%)
*Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri, a ferry operator on the Bosphoros and Sea of Marmara, Turkey (held by HGT shareholders direct)
*PolskiBus, an intercity coach service operator in Poland, sold to Flixbus in December 2017
*Alexander Dennis, a bus and coach manufacturer in UK, Asia and North America
*Argent Energy, a biodiesel manufacturer
*Sunseeker, a luxury motor yacht manufacturer
*OnniBus (75%), an intercity coach operator in Finland purchased in May 2014, sold October 2018
*SuperBus.com, an intercity coach operator in Baltic states

====InMotion Group====

Highland Global Transport has purchased and established a number of subsidiaries in New Zealand. In August 2015, these were brought together under the one umbrella as the InMotion Group with 340 buses and coaches and 17 ferries.

*Mana Coach Services, an urban bus operator in Wellington
*Howick &amp; Eastern Buses, an urban bus operator in Auckland
*Fullers Group (Fullers360), operator of commuter and tourist ferry services on Auckland Harbour and Hauraki Gulf
*ManaBus, an inter-city coach operator
*Naked Bus, an inter-city coach operator
*Reesby Buses, 40 vehicle coach operator

ManaBus and Naked Bus ceased operation on 15 July 2018, with the bus fleets being sold to Ritchies Transport. Reesby Buses was also sold to Ritchies in February 2019. Mana Coach Services and Howick &amp; Eastern Buses were sold to Transdev Australasia in October and November 2019 respectively. This leaves Fullers Group (Fullers360) as Souter&#x27;s only subsidiary in New Zealand as of November 2019.

===Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland===

In April 2015, Souter was officially appointed vice president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, alongside newly appointed president, Jim Pettigrew. Souter, who qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1984, was the sole nominee for the vice-president role. In May 2017 the organisation appointed him as its president.

==Political activity==

===Section 28===

In 2000, the Scottish Executive proposed the abolition of Section 28 laws, which forbade local authorities from &quot;intentionally promoting homosexuality&quot;. Souter was a prominent leader of the Keep the Clause campaign, which sought to prevent its abolition. In Scotland, where Section 28 was known as clause 2A, Souter spent £1 million on the first privately funded postal referendum across Scotland to gauge public opinion. A spokesman for Souter stated &quot;He is not in this for personal glory. He is fighting this battle because he is a father and committed Christian.&quot;

3,970,712 ballot papers were posted out and 31.8% valid votes were returned, a turnout rate lower than any Scottish national election. 86.8% were in favour of keeping Clause 28, 13.2% in favour of repeal.

Souter pointed out that the number of people who voted to keep the clause exceeded the number of votes cast for any single political party in Scotland at any election over the preceding ten years, although Scottish voters usually choose from four main parties, not two options. The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.

Souter&#x27;s campaign group approached the Electoral Reform Society to organise the ballot through its ballot services subsidiary. The society refused the request as it believed the poll &quot;would not be a legitimate democratic exercise to ask people to give an opinion on the repeal of Section 28 without knowing the detail of what would replace it&quot;. Many groups hostile to Souter&#x27;s stance had called for a public boycott of the poll, and accordingly claimed that as only a minority voted this was a defeat for Souter and his supporters. Mainstream politicians, including the Scottish National Party (which Souter has supported) largely ignored his poll and disputed whether the result was a true reflection of public opinion, with the Scottish Executive stating that the public had been fed a diet of &quot;misinformation and lies&quot; by Souter&#x27;s campaign group. The Communities Minister, Wendy Alexander MSP, criticised the poll, stating &quot;I think what is significant about today&#x27;s ballot is that two out of three voters rejected, or binned or simply ignored this glorified opinion poll.&quot; Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell stated that &quot;Brian Souter&#x27;s support for Section 28 is the moral equivalent of the business-funded campaign to maintain racial segregation in the Deep South of the USA in the 1950s.&quot; Tatchell said that Souter&#x27;s campaign was &quot;hateful&quot; and that it is clear that he was using his vast fortune to try to keep a cruel and &quot;bigoted law&quot; intact.

===Donations to SNP and other political parties===

Souter was a major financial supporter of the Scottish National Party (SNP). In March 2007, he donated £500,000, citing an imbalance of funding within Scottish politics. He stated that it was his intention to redress an imbalance in funding: &quot;as long as I can remember, the case for the union has been hugely financed by cash from London, while the case for independence has lacked resources. I hope my donation will help redress this imbalance&quot;. Following the donation, SNP leader Alex Salmond was criticised for &quot;pandering to homophobia&quot; by accepting the donation. Salmond thanked Souter for his support, calling him &quot;one of the outstanding entrepreneurs of his generation&quot;. One month later, in April 2007, the SNP&#x27;s commitment (made at the party&#x27;s 2006 conference) to re-regulate the bus network was dropped from the 2007 manifesto, although the SNP denied any direct link.

In February 2011 Souter again pledged financial support for the SNP, promising to match every pound they raised with a donation of up to £500,000. Announcing his support he said Salmond and the SNP deserved a second term in office. The SNP won a resounding victory in the election with Salmond being returned unopposed as First Minister.

The BBC reported in August 2014 that Souter had donated £1 million to the campaign for Scottish independence. Since Nicola Sturgeon became SNP leader in November 2014, Souter has made no further donation, but in December 2014 he gave £3,500 to the Lewes branch of the Liberal Democrats.

In 2023, Souter aided Humza Yousaf’s government to organise a dinner between government and businesses. Patrick Harvie, the Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings, Active Travel and Tenants’ Rights stated &quot;what has to be really, really clear is that not just my party, but the Scottish Government, does not share the values of Brian Souter.&quot;.

==Charitable work==

In 1992 Souter and his wife set up the Souter Charitable Trust, which assists humanitarian projects in the UK and overseas, especially, but not exclusively, those with a Christian emphasis. Projects include the prevention of malaria and supplying daily meals to school children in Africa. The Trust has donated more than £98m to 13,000 worthwhile causes.

Groups funded annually by the trust include Tearfund, The Message Trust, Oasis Trust and Jam International.

In April 2019, Souter&#x27;s company Stagecoach Southeast was announced as the sponsor of the annual Turner Prize for visual artists, but the sponsorship was ended a few days later by mutual agreement after public criticism of Souter&#x27;s involvement in the sponsorship.

==Honours and awards==

In 1997 Souter was granted an honorary degree from Strathclyde University.

In 1998 he was awarded the Scottish Entrepreneur Award.

In 1999 he received his second honorary degree, from Abertay University.

In 2004 he was honoured with the Businessman of the Year award at the Insider Elite Awards.

In 2008 he was given a Special Recognition Award for services to the bus industry.

In June 2010 he was given a Special Career Service Award at the &quot;Talent In Mobility&quot; Awards, part of the European Mobility Exhibition held in Paris for the public transport industry.

In October 2010 he was awarded the Ernst &amp; Young UK Master Entrepreneur of the Year.

In 2011 he was presented with an outstanding achievement award at the 2011 Perthshire Chamber of Commerce Business Star Awards.

On 18 April 2012 he was inducted into the British Travel and Hospitality Industry Hall of Fame, the first public transport entrepreneur to receive the honour.

===Knighthood===

Souter was knighted in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to transport and the voluntary sector. This proved controversial, and was criticised by Scottish Labour MP Cathy Jamieson, who suggested a link between the knighthood and the large amounts of money he has donated to the Scottish National Party. In a public statement, Jamieson said: &quot;The First Minister and his party must look seriously at the relationship they have developed with wealthy individuals handing them large sums of cash. The public will rightly be asking what&#x27;s next on Mr Souter&#x27;s shopping list?&quot; Salmond denied any wrongdoing in the matter and referred himself for investigation after calls for a probe by Scottish MP Jim Sheridan. An independent report, conducted by Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, cleared Salmond of any wrongdoing, asserting that &quot;There appears to me to have been no breach of the ministerial code by Alex Salmond as First Minister and he should be wholly exonerated of any breach.&quot;

Souter&#x27;s knighthood was also criticised by some gay rights campaigners, who felt that the honour was insulting to the gay community and was effectively rewarding homophobia, given Souter&#x27;s past campaigning. A petition to have the knighthood withdrawn received 5,000 signatures by July 2011.

==Personal life==

In 1998, Souter described English Northerners (who make up a considerable proportion of his customers) as &quot;the beer-drinking, chip-eating, council house-dwelling, old Labour-voting masses.&quot;

Souter lives in Perth, Scotland with his wife and four children. He is a member of the Church of the Nazarene, and attends Trinity Church of the Nazarene in Perth.

<text>St. Andrew is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located under University Avenue where it is intersected by King Street West. The station, which opened in 1963, is named for the nearby St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
South of the station the line curves 90 degrees east to run under Front Street to Union station.

==Nearby landmarks==
The station is near the Entertainment District, including Roy Thomson Hall, Royal Alexandra Theatre, Princess of Wales Theatre and TIFF Lightbox, the home of the Toronto International Film Festival. Also nearby is the Financial District and the Toronto Stock Exchange, with access east of the station via the PATH pedestrian tunnel system to Sun Life Centre, Exchange Tower, First Canadian Place, Standard Life Centre, and Toronto-Dominion Centre. Destinations west of the station, also available via PATH, include Metro Hall, Canadian Broadcasting Centre, RBC Centre, Ritz-Carlton Toronto and Simcoe Place, and continuing further to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on the south side of Front Street.

== Surface connections ==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway and these surface TTC streetcar routes:

TTC routes serving the station include:
== Station improvements==
Starting in 2008, several minor improvements to the station were implemented. A trial installation of LED lights at the south end of the platform was being used to study their effectiveness in the system. The decision to keep them was made in September 2009, and permanent installation began in February 2011.

Removal of the metal slat wall cover treatment began in 2009. In June 2009, the installation of a new wall treatment began. The new treatment consisted of enamel-painted sheet metal that was white with dark green trim and lettering. On March 25, 2010, the panels were replaced with new versions that showed less buckling; however, the buckling issue was not totally resolved and a new stronger version was being developed.

The station was converted to full wheelchair accessibility by adding a new elevator inside the station from the mezzanine level to the subway platform, and upgrading an elevator in a nearby office complex at 145 King St West to provide access from street level to the mezzanine. The project started in 2010 and the elevators went into service in June 2012.

<text>Lillian Barbara Board, (13 December 1948 – 26 December 1970) was a British athlete. She won the silver medal in the 400 metres at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and two gold medals at the 1969 European Championships in Athletics in Athens. Her career was cut short in 1970 when she developed the colorectal cancer that within months would claim her life at the age of 22.

==Early life==
Board was born in Durban, South Africa on 13 December 1948. Her parents, George and Frances Board, had emigrated from Manchester, England in April 1947 with their son, George Alfred. Growing homesick, shortly after the birth of Lillian and her fraternal twin sister, Irene, the family moved back to Manchester in February 1950.

In 1956, the family moved to Ealing, west London, where Lillian and Irene, then aged 7, started studying at Drayton Green School.

==Developing athletics career==
In 1960, at the age of 11, Lillian and her sister moved to Grange Secondary Modern Girls&#x27; School, also in Ealing and now part of The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls. It was here in 1961 that Physical Education teacher Sue Gibson (a Middlesex county discus champion) spotted that Lillian, now aged 12, had a special talent for running. She took her to join London Olympiades, the leading all-female athletics club, which had a training base at Alperton, north-west London. Here she competed in relays and 100 and 150-yard sprints.

The following year, 1962, she began competing in the long jump and after training through that winter, improved markedly as both a sprinter and long jumper.

In 1963, aged 14, she won the junior long jump title at the All-England Schools Championships (now known as The English Schools Championships) with a leap of , and then finished second () in the long jump at the Women&#x27;s Amateur Athletic Association&#x27;s national junior championships. She ended the season with victory in the long jump at the Southern Inter-Counties meeting, her leap of the best by a British junior girl that year.

Trained by her father George and inspired by an illustrious club-mate, international long jumper and pentathlete Mary Rand, she concentrated on the sprints from the 1964 season with an emphasis on strength work and with a view to eventually moving up from the short sprints to the 440 and 880 yards, where George felt sure her future lay. She made her debut over both 220 yds and 880 yds in 1964, winning both events in times of 26.2 and 2:30.8, respectively.

In 1965, aged 16, Board was a member of the London Olympiades squad that won the 4 × 100 m relay title at the Women&#x27;s AAA junior championships. Later that year, she showed her versatility with a career best leap of 5.80 m in the Long Jump and indoor wins over 60 yards (7.2) and 300 yards (42.0). She also lowered her 100 y best time to 10.9 and her 220 y best to 24.7.

Due to age rules, Board was unable to make her debut at the 440 yds until April 1966 when, aged 17 and now a senior, she finished a close second in an inter-club meeting at Southall, London, in 58.1 seconds. She then ran 57.3 in the Southern Counties Championships, before taking fourth place in the Women&#x27;s AAA senior 440 yds final in a time of 54.6, the fastest ever recorded by a 17-year-old in Europe. Meanwhile, she took a secretarial course at Chiswick Polytechnic after leaving school, and worked between training sessions as a typist.

==International success==

===1966 season===
Board&#x27;s performances at 400 m in the 1966 season earned her a place in the England team for the Commonwealth Games held in Kingston, Jamaica, that August. Here, after winning her 400 m heat (54.7), Board finished fifth in the final in a time of 54.7 seconds, just outside her personal best. It was a very creditable effort for a 17-year-old. Disappointingly, she was not then chosen for the Great Britain team at the European Championships in Budapest, which were held from 30 August – 4 September. However, such disappointment was short-lived as later in September, she made her Great Britain debut, achieving fourth in the 400 m (55.9) in a match against France in Lille.

===1967 season===
Board became the national 440 yards champion after winning the British WAAA Championships title at the 1967 WAAA Championships.

Board firmly announced her arrival onto the international scene when, still aged only 18, she won the 400 m race in a Commonwealth v USA match in Los Angeles, California on 9 July 1967. She came from last to first with a stunning late surge and won in a time of 52.8 seconds, the second fastest ever recorded by a European woman. The race was broadcast live on British television and made her into a household name. Winning in such style at the biggest meeting of year was clearly a turning point in her career.

She followed this momentous triumph with a run of four wins at 400 m in five international events, most notably securing the only victory for Britain&#x27;s women (in a time of 53.7) in the 1967 European Cup, final in Kyiv on 15 September. That season she also lowered her 200 m personal best to 24.6 and her 880 y best to 2.08.7. Recognition of a highly successful season came when she was chosen as Athlete of the Year by the Athletic Writers&#x27; Association.

===1968 season and Olympic Games===
Board began the 1968 season by winning the 440-yard race at an inter-club meeting in Brighton, her time of 54.8 comfortably inside the Olympic qualifying standard. She then leapt to the top of the world rankings after winning over 400 m (53.5) at an international meeting in Moscow. However, at the Women&#x27;s AAA championships in July, she spurned the chance of an almost certain victory in the 400 m and instead decided to contest the 800 metres. After winning her heat (2.05.7), she showed her huge potential in this event by running a superb 2:02.0 (the second fastest ever by a British woman), to finish 2nd to the reigning European 800 m champion, Vera Nikolic of Yugoslavia, whose time of 2:00.5 was a new world record.

She continued her preparations for Mexico with a personal best of 23.5 when winning the 200 m in a match against West Germany in August and taking the 400 m (53.0) against Poland in September. She also anchored a British relay team to a new 4 × 110 y world record (45.0) later that month.

After that excellent build-up, she went into the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as favourite to win the 400 m gold medal. After finishing a comfortable second in her 400 m heat (53.00), she won her semi-final in a personal best 52.56. In the final itself on 16 October, she only took the lead about 100 m from the finish and maintained her advantage well down the home straight. She looked certain to win but was caught just before the line by Colette Besson of France and beaten into second place by a mere 0.09 seconds. Setting a new UK record of 52.12 had not quite been enough to win gold. Nevertheless, it was an excellent effort by a 19-year-old competing in her first Olympics.

===1969 season and European Championships===
In 1969, Board began the season with a personal best 11.9 for 100 metres and a 52.9 contribution to a 4 × 400 metres world record (3:37.6), but in early July she strained ligaments in her back, forcing her to miss five weeks of the season. She returned in August with a 52.5 anchor leg in the 4 × 400 m relay to help Great Britain defeat the USA in an international match at London&#x27;s White City; and then gained a modicum of &#x27;revenge&#x27; on her Olympic nemesis, Colette Besson, when taking the 400 m (53.7) in a match against France in Middlesbrough.

However, her back was still painful, more so when she ran shorter distances, so she decided to go for the 800 metres at the 1969 European Athletics Championships in Athens that September. Still inexperienced at the longer event and ranked only 8th in Europe on her performances that season, she was not strongly fancied for 800 m gold. She won her heat comfortably (2:04.2) and then, two days later, produced a superb performance in the final on 18 September sprinting away from her rivals on the final bend and winning by eight metres in a personal best time of 2:01.4, a new championship record. She was the first British woman to win this European title, the second being Lynsey Sharp in 2012.

Just two days later, 20 September, Board lined up for Great Britain in the 4 × 400 m relay. Running the last leg, she came from ten metres down entering the home straight to beat her old rival Besson, who was anchoring the French squad, in a dramatic photo finish, not only winning gold for Britain but also helping to set a new world record of 3:30.8. Having claimed two gold medals, it was no surprise that she was named as &#x27;Best Woman Athlete in the Games&#x27;. The relay team, featuring Board, Rosemary Stirling, Pat Lowe and Janet Simpson, was the first British team to win that title at the competition.

A further accolade came when she was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to sport, in the 1970 New Year Honours. Known as the Golden Girl of British athletics for her blonde good looks and medal success, Board had become a very popular public figure, earning herself another nickname: &#x27;Britain&#x27;s favourite girl&#x27;. In December 1969, she was the &#x27;mystery runner&#x27; at the &quot;Nos Galan&quot; (New Year&#x27;s Eve) festival, held annually in the Welsh village of Mountain Ash to commemorate the legendary Welsh runner, Guto Nyth Bran.

===1970 season===
Board ran two-mile races early in the 1970 campaign, partly to build up stamina for the 800 m and partly with the aim of becoming the first athlete to represent Britain at all distances, the 1500 m being the only one missing from her collection. After running a solid 4:55.7 on her miling debut, she was selected for an international mile race in Rome on 16 May. Here she improved her personal best to 4:44.6, finishing second to a former mile world record holder, Paola Pigni of Italy. Her time moved her to No 2 in the UK all-time lists for the women&#x27;s mile, behind only another former world record holder at the distance, Anne Smith.

==Cancer and early death==

===Initial health problems===
Soon after the mile race in Rome, she began to suffer from stomach upsets. These were diagnosed as a virus and she was prescribed pills. She continued to feel unwell but still managed to contribute a 2:07.0 leg to a 4 × 800 m world record on 13 June in Edinburgh. She ran 2:06.8 six days later when winning her 800 m heat at the Women&#x27;s AAA championships at Crystal Palace, London, despite being doubled up in pain before the race. Pale and underweight, she then finished a tired third (2:05.1) in the 800 m final on 20 June.

===Diagnosis and treatment===
That 800 m final proved to be her last race. X-rays revealed inflammation of the bladder and her condition was initially diagnosed as Crohn&#x27;s disease, forcing her to halt training and ruling her out of July&#x27;s Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. However, after further X-rays, tests and two biopsies she was correctly diagnosed with terminal colorectal cancer (or bowel cancer) in September 1970. An exploratory operation at St Mark&#x27;s Hospital, London, on 8 October, revealed that the cancer had spread to her stomach and she was given two months to live.

Seeking a cure, she travelled in November 1970 to the village of Rottach-Egern, in the Bavarian Alps near Munich, West Germany, to be treated by the controversial physician Dr Josef Issels at his Ringberg Cancer Clinic. Adhering to his belief in non-mainstream treatments, she was placed on a strict diet of healthy food and with spring water and herbal tea as her only drinks. She then had her tonsils and two front teeth removed as Issels believed they helped spread infection.

Her condition worsened and she was moved to an intensive care unit at the clinic on 11 December. The following day, she underwent an operation to drain water from her abdomen.

===Early death===
She was transferred to Munich University Clinic on 21 December 1970, with suspected peritonitis. She was found not to have peritonitis but still needed to undergo an operation to remove a stomach blockage. This was done on 23 December. She recovered from the after-effects of the operation, but on 24 December she lapsed into a coma from which she would not emerge. She died in Munich two days later, aged 22. She was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium on 1 January 1971.

A memorial service was held for her at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, on 21 January 1971, and she is commemorated in Munich with an avenue bearing her name that leads to the Munich Olympic Stadium. A biography entitled simply &quot;Lillian&quot; was published by her fiancé, David Emery, in 1971.

==Personal bests==
She only competed twice in the mile run and ceased competing in the long jump in 1967.

==Personal life==
Board was engaged to sports journalist David Emery at the time of her death. Emery was at her side throughout her illness. He subsequently married her twin sister Irene.

A talented dressmaker and designer, Board often made her own clothes, including a pink coat she wore to receive the MBE from Queen Elizabeth II in January 1970.

She was the only female panellist on the first nationwide edition of BBC TV&#x27;s quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, broadcast on 5 January 1970. The other panellists were footballers George Best and Tom Finney and cricketer Ray Illingworth (the team captains were boxer Henry Cooper and rugby player Cliff Morgan, and the presenter was David Vine.) The recording of this historic edition of one of television&#x27;s most popular and durable programmes (now in its 54th year) is missing from the BBC archives.

<doc id="1304227" wikidata="Q7893098" url="?curid=1304227" title="2004 United States presidential election in Texas">
<text>The 2004 United States presidential election in Texas took place on November 2, 2004, and was part of the 2004 United States presidential election. State voters chose 34 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.

Texas was won by incumbent Republican President George W. Bush by a margin of 22.87%. Prior to the election, all 12 major U.S. news organizations expected Texas to vote for Bush, considering it to be a safe red state.

Texas has not voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1976, and has been a Republican stronghold since the 1980s. A former governor of the state, Bush&#x27;s performance stands as a high water mark for Republican presidential candidates in Texas, and remains the last time that a Republican has won more than 60% of the state&#x27;s vote, or that a Democrat has won less than 40%. Bush is the last Republican to win any of the following counties in a presidential election: Bexar (home of San Antonio), Dallas (home of Dallas), and Harris (home of Houston). Cameron and Culberson counties would not vote Republican again until 2024. The 1,067,968 ballots cast in Harris County also marked the first time that any Texas county would cast more than one million votes. However, this is also the last election where Harris County would vote to the left of any of the five most populous counties in the state, with the exception of Tarrant County. Harris County in this election voted to the left of Bexar by approximately 0.2% of the votes. This is also the most recent election in which the Republican candidate would win Tarrant County with at least 60% of the vote. Starting from 2008, Republicans would win Tarrant with less than 60% of the vote, and in 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden narrowly carried the county.

Bush, who made historic gains with Latino voters in 2004, drew even with Kerry among Texan Latinos, winning 49% to Kerry&#x27;s 50%. 

This is the most recent presidential election in which a Republican candidate has gotten over 60% of the statewide vote. In 2008 there would be a shift in many of the urban counties Bush carried in this election toward Democratic candidate Barack Obama, though the state would still be won by his Republican opponent, John McCain.

==Primaries==
* 2004 Texas Democratic presidential primary
* 2004 Texas Republican presidential primary

==Campaign==
===Predictions===

===Fundraising===
Bush raised $23,776,943. Kerry raised $5,554,831.

===Advertising and visits===
Neither campaign advertised or visited this state during the fall election.

==Analysis==

Texas, located in the South, has become a consistently Republican state at all levels. Economically and racially diverse, Texas includes a huge swath of the Bible Belt where many voters, especially those in rural Texas, identify as born-again or evangelical Christians and therefore tend to vote Republican due to the party&#x27;s opposition to abortion. Although once part of the Solid South, the last time Texas voted for a Democratic presidential nominee was Jimmy Carter in 1976. George Bush achieved his party&#x27;s best result in Texas since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s second landslide in 1984.

President Bush carried 236 of the state&#x27;s 254 counties, improving on his performance from 2000. East Texas, historically the most Democratic region in the state, solidified its support for the Republican Party with only Jefferson County, home to Beaumont, voting for John Kerry. South Texas, while still voting heavily for Senator Kerry, swung towards Bush as well.

Despite Bush&#x27;s increased margin in the state compared to 2000, Kerry made major inroads in the state&#x27;s suburban areas, especially in Metro Houston, the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, and the Austin area. Kerry narrowed Bush&#x27;s 2000 margins in Collin, Dallas, Denton, Fort Bend, Harris, Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties. Out of those, however, only Travis County, home to Austin, flipped into the Democratic column, in part due to the city&#x27;s strong liberal leanings and opposition to the Iraq War. Bush had won a plurality in the county in 2000 in part due to the Green Party&#x27;s Ralph Nader winning 11% of the county&#x27;s vote. Although Bush carried Dallas County by a narrow margin of 50% to Kerry&#x27;s 49%, the city of Dallas proper voted heavily for Kerry, giving him 57% of the vote.

==Electors==
Technically the voters of Texas cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Texas is allocated 34 electors because it has 32 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 34 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 34 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.

The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.

The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 34 were pledged to Bush/Cheney:

# Royce Hayes
# Tom Cotter
# Jay Pierce
# Marjorie Chandler
# Lance Lenz
# Barbara Grusendorf
# Bill Borden

<text>The City of Dreadful Night is a long poem by the Scottish poet James &quot;B.V.&quot; Thomson, written between 1870 and 1873, and published in the &quot;National Reformer&quot; in 1874, then, in 1880, in a book entitled &quot;The City of Dreadful Night and Other Poems&quot;. The poem is noted for the pessimistic philosophy that it expresses. It has been argued that the city described in the poem is based on London.

The poem, despite its insistently bleak tone, won the praise of George Meredith, Rudyard Kipling and of George Saintsbury, who in &quot;A History of Nineteenth-Century Literature&quot; wrote that &quot;what saves Thomson is the perfection with which he expresses the negative and hopeless side of the sense of mystery.&quot;

<doc id="1304238" wikidata="Q850811" url="?curid=1304238" title="Union station (TTC)">
<text>Union is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It opened in 1954 as one of twelve original stations on the first phase of the Yonge line, the first rapid transit line in Canada. It was the southern terminus of the line until the opening of the University line in 1963, and is today the inflection point of the U-shaped line. Along with Spadina station and Queens Quay station, it is one of three stations open overnight to support late-night streetcar routes.

Union station is located on Front Street between the Yonge Street and University Avenue sections of the line. It is named for and directly connects to the railway station and regional bus terminal of the same name, serving all GO Transit train lines and train-bus services as well as Via Rail intercity routes (including Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; service to New York City). It connects to the Union Pearson Express (UPX), a dedicated rail link to Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is the only subway station with a direct connection to Via services.

Based on Toronto&#x27;s street grid, Union is the southernmost subway station and the closest to Lake Ontario; however, using standard compass directions, Kipling and Islington stations are further south. It serves approximately 100,000 people a day, ranking it as the fourth-busiest station in the system, after Bloor–Yonge, St. George, and Sheppard–Yonge, and the busiest served by only one line. Adjacent to the subway station is an underground terminal loop for the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar.

In 2007, Union subway station became the first location on the TTC where Presto cards could be used, as part of a trial. Wi-Fi service has been available at this station since 2014.

==History==

The station opened as the southern terminus of the original Yonge subway line on March 30, 1954.

On February 28, 1963, Union became a through station with the opening of the University section of the Yonge–University line.

On June 22, 1990, Union became the terminus of route 604 Harbourfront LRT, now part of the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar routes. A new underground streetcar platform was built south of the subway tracks, connected to the station concourse by a 30-metre pedestrian tunnel and a flight of stairs.

Elevators were installed in 1996, making Union one of the first wheelchair-accessible subway stations in Toronto. An elevator was added to the streetcar platforms, even though streetcars were not accessible themselves. By the time accessible streetcars began serving the station in 2014, the elevator had been replaced as a part of the station expansion.
On August 18, 2014, a second subway platform was opened to serve Yonge line trains, leaving the existing platform to serve only University line trains.

=== Station expansion ===
In 2003, planning began on a station expansion to address overcrowding in the station. Despite being one of the busiest stations in the system, the station had only one narrow island platform serving both the University and Yonge lines, and a small concourse area.

The plan was to build a new subway platform on the south side of the tracks to serve the Yonge portion of the line, leaving the existing island platform to serve only the University portion. This new platform would feature a step-free connection to the streetcar platform. The project also included an expansion of the concourse level, the replacement of all finishes and signage, installation of public art, as well as improved connections to the adjacent Union Station and the PATH network.

At a cost of $137million, construction began in February 2011, with the new second platform opening on August 18, 2014. The project was completed in 2015 with the completion of the station renovation.

In 2019, as part of the rebuilding and expansion of the adjacent Union Station, large glass canopies were installed in the &quot;moat&quot; that connects the subway station to the rest of the Union station complex. This weather-protected route connecting to the main concourses at Union Station ensures that commuters do not need to go outside when entering or leaving the TTC station.

==Station decor==
When the station opened in 1954, the wall coverings were glossy yellow Vitrolite tiles with red lettering and trim, and the station name on the walls was in the TTC&#x27;s unique Toronto Subway Font. During renovations in the 1980s, the yellow Vitrolite tiles were replaced with brown ceramic tiles and vinyl siding, and the station font was changed to Univers.

The 2011 to 2015 station expansion replaced these tiles and panels with white tiles and black trim, and the font used to render the station name was returned to its original Toronto Subway typeface.

As part of the second platform project, a glass wall was built to block off the southern side of the old platform, since it now only serves the University line. It features the art piece &quot;Zones of Immersion&quot; by Stuart Reid, a professor at the OCAD University The work comprises 166 large glass panels, each measuring more than one by two metres, extending along the length of the platform. Mostly transparent, it is visible from both the Yonge and University platforms. Each panel contains images or words, many based on sketches that Reid drew while riding the subway. Public reaction towards the art piece has been mixed, with some users of the station finding it &quot;tragic&quot; or &quot;dark and depressing&quot;.
==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

==Streetcar loop==
Union Station Loop is located underground at the north end of a tunnel running under Bay Street through the underground Queens Quay station from the street Queens Quay. The loop runs anticlockwise on a single track along a curved platform. An underground passage connects the streetcar platform to the Yonge subway platform. Union Station Loop is the eastern terminus of the 509 Harbourfront and southern terminus of the 510 Spadina streetcar route. The loop has a minimum radius of curvature of .

A 2017 TTC report stated that the streetcar loop would become inadequate for the volume of customers it handled because of its single track and its curved, narrow platform. The loop would not be able to handle the peak demand of 3700 people per hour projected for 2041. A 2010 environmental assessment for the East Bayfront LRT (a proposed streetcar line) approved rebuilding the existing streetcar loop plus the construction of a connection from the streetcar tunnel to the East Bayfront LRT on Queens Quay East. The LRT design would have rebuilt the loop to have four platforms, each with a bypass track, so that a streetcar could bypass other streetcars loading or unloading. Expansion of the loop&#x27;s capacity would be needed in order to support an East Bayfront LRT. In 2017, conversion of the tunnel under Bay Street to operate a funicular shuttle to Queens Quay station instead of streetcars was considered but ultimately rejected. , the conversion of the streetcar loop into a four-platform configuration is in the design stage.

<text>Mehmet Murat Okur (born 26 May 1979) is a Turkish former professional basketball player. Listed at , he played as a power forward and center.

Okur is known for his three-point shooting and ability to space the floor. In his seven seasons with the Utah Jazz, he emerged as a talented shooter in the NBA. From 2004 to 2010, he displayed a talent for making big shots in pressure situations, earning him the nickname of &quot;the Money Man&quot; and &quot;Memo is Money&quot; among Jazz fans. Okur was also the first Turkish player in NBA history to win an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004.

In 2016, Okur was named a player development coach for the Phoenix Suns, becoming the first Turkish citizen to enter the coaching world in the NBA.

==Early career==
Okur notes Toni Kukoč was his favorite player while he was growing up. He helped the Turkish 22-and-under national team to 6th place at the 1997 world championship. He was transferred to Efes Pilsen (now known as Anadolu Efes) in 2000 and won a championship in the 2001–2002 Turkish Basketball League season. He averaged 13.5 points per game during his last season in Turkey.

==Professional career==
===Detroit Pistons (2002–2004)===
Okur was selected 38th overall in the second round of the 2001 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. He played two seasons for the Pistons from 2002–03 to 2003–04. On November 7, 2003, Okur led the Pistons to a 105–99 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, with a career-high 18 rebounds and 12 points. During the 2004 NBA playoffs, Okur helped Detroit win the NBA championship in June 2004. He became the first Turkish player to win an NBA championship. Due to salary cap limitations, the Pistons were unable to pay a top-level salary for Okur, and Okur was able to parlay his success into a six-year, US$50 million contract with the Utah Jazz.

===Utah Jazz (2004–2011)===
Okur signed with the Jazz on 27 July 2004 and played seven seasons in Utah from 2004 to 2011, spending the majority of his career with the team. Standing and 290 lbs (132 kg), Okur played the center and power forward positions for the Jazz. In his first season (2004–2005) with Utah, he played in all 82 games, starting in 25 of them. Nicknamed &quot;Memo&quot;, Okur made his presence felt during his second (2005–2006) season with Utah, increasing his scoring average from 12.9 points per game the previous season to 18.0 points per game. He started in all 82 games for the second straight season, the only Utah Jazz player to do so. In his third season, he continued to be a key player for Utah.

He was named to the Western Conference All-Star team for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. He and Ray Allen were selected as replacements for injured original members Allen Iverson and Steve Nash. He was the first Turkish player to participate in this event.

On 12 January 2009, Okur scored a career-high in points with 43 against the Indiana Pacers during a 120–113 win.

On 10 July 2009 Okur signed a two-year contract extension reportedly worth approximately $21 million.

On 17 April 2010, Okur ruptured his Achilles&#x27; tendon during the first game of the post-season against the Denver Nuggets, eliminating him from the remainder of the NBA playoffs, as well as the World Basketball Championships in his native Turkey later that summer.

He returned on 17 December 2010 and scored 2 points against the New Orleans Hornets.

===Türk Telekom Ankara (2011)===
In September 2011, Okur signed a contract with Türk Telekom B.K. His contract had an out-clause, which allowed him to return to the NBA when the 2011 NBA lockout was resolved.

===New Jersey Nets (2011–2012)===
On 22 December 2011, Okur was traded to the New Jersey Nets for a 2015 second round pick (later used to select Pat Connaughton). This reunited him with former Jazz teammate, PG Deron Williams, who was traded to the Nets the previous season. Okur played 17 games for the Nets, averaging 7.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.

On 15 March 2012, Okur was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers along with Shawne Williams and a 2012 first-round pick (later used to select Damian Lillard in exchange for Gerald Wallace.

He was waived by Portland on 21 March 2012.

Later in 2012, Okur decided to retire from basketball, citing injuries. In Okur&#x27;s final 2 years in the league, he only played 30 games total. His final game being on January 25, 2012, where he recorded 11 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists in a 97–90 win over the 76ers.

==Coaching career==
Before working as a coach, Okur was an ambassador for the Utah Jazz from 2014 to August 2016. On 13 September 2016, he agreed to a deal that made him one of the newest player development coaches for the Phoenix Suns. Okur would soon become the first Turkish-born coach to ever be a part of an NBA coaching staff in some capacity. With the earlier hiring of Canadian Jay Triano, it would also mark the first time that two foreign-born coaches would take part in participating in the Suns&#x27; coaching staff at the same time. He would also be reunited with his former teammate Earl Watson and former coach Tyrone Corbin, although their roles would be different with Watson being the head coach and Corbin being an assistant coach.

After seeing slight improvements in his first season as a player development coach, Okur was fired alongside assistant coach Nate Bjorkgren and fellow player development coach Jason Fraser on 22 October 2017. The sudden firing came after the Suns had some very poor performances to start out their 50th anniversary season, leading to a 0–3 start to their season.

==Personal life==
He is married to actress and former Miss Turkey finalist Yeliz Çalışkan. They have a daughter, Melisa, born on 21 March 2007, and two sons, Yiğit Mehmet Okur, born on 19 February 2010, and Mert Mehmet Okur, born on 19 November 2014. He and his family currently live in San Diego, California.

<text>King is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway system. The station is located at the intersection of King Street and Yonge Street in Toronto&#x27;s Financial District.

==History==
King station opened in 1954 as part of the first stretch of subway line built in Toronto, between and stations.

The original address for the station was 70 Yonge Street, which is still used in Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) maps, but the official website uses the address 3 King Street East, which both point to the intersection of the two streets, and the numbers are not used by nearby buildings.

A scissors crossover was installed just north of the station when the line was built, so that trains could easily crossover from one track to another, but was later removed in May 1984 during track rehabilitation because of maintenance costs. In 2012, the TTC decided to restore this crossover, as it would allow trains to turn back during service disruptions after the implementation of automatic train control, which occurred on February 24, 2020.
==Station description==
The station lies underneath Yonge Street at King Street, and is built on three levels. All five entrances are located on ground level, with three of them being sidewalk staircases from the northeast, southwest, and southeast corners of the Yonge Street and King Street intersection. The northwest corner entrance is through Scotia Plaza, and a semi-automatic entrance from Commerce Court East at 21 Melinda Street is staffed by a collector during rush hour. There is also an &quot;exit only&quot; sidewalk staircase from the southbound subway platform, just south of Melinda Street. There are no elevators in this station, and it is not accessible for persons with physical disabilities.

Below ground level are two separate concourses, located under King Street (north concourse), and under Commerce Court (south concourse). All entrances and exits connect to the north concourse except for ones along Melinda Street. Below the concourses are the subway platforms, connected by stairs and one escalator to the northbound platform on weekdays from 3:00 pm to 6:30 pm.

Gateway Newsstands located in the north concourse is the only tenant in the station.

==Station improvements==
As part of its Public Art Program announced in June 2017, the TTC intends to install an artwork titled &quot;Light Canopy&quot; by artist Sean Martindale. The work is an animated lighting system to be set into the ceiling above the stairwell at King station&#x27;s western entrance, and will give passers-by the feeling of passing under tree foliage.

In January 2023, the TTC began construction to add elevators to the side platforms, with a new exit to be built at Melinda Street, and a second at Yonge and College Streets. The elevators will connect the north- and southbound platforms to the street level concourse. Construction is scheduled to be completed by mid-2026.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
North of the station, the subway travels through a scissors crossover through its tunnels underneath Yonge Street, past Queen Street, and into Queen station. South of the station, the subway continues underneath Yonge Street, until it reaches Front Street, where it turns 90 degrees west and passes through a crossover into Union station.

==Nearby destinations==
The destination for many people using King station is the financial district and its numerous office towers, connected to the station by the underground PATH system of pedestrian tunnels. These include the Canadian Pacific Building, Scotia Plaza, Commerce Court, Toronto-Dominion Centre and First Canadian Place.

This is also the closest station to One Yonge Street, the King Edward Hotel, St. James Cathedral, Toronto Sculpture Garden, St. Lawrence Hall and the St. Lawrence Market.
==Surface connections==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:

<doc id="1304244" wikidata="Q242187" url="?curid=1304244" title="Agnes of Waiblingen">
<text>Agnes of Waiblingen (1072/73 – 24 September 1143), also known as Agnes of Germany, Agnes of Franconia and Agnes of Saarbrücken, was a member of the Salian imperial family. Through her first marriage, she was Duchess of Swabia; through her second marriage, she was Margravine of Austria.

== Family ==
She was the daughter of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Bertha of Savoy. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Agnes of Poitou. She had two siblings, Adelaide/Adelheid and Henry, who died in infancy, and two brothers, Conrad, and Henry. Her mother died when she was around 15, and around 17, her father remarried to Eupraxia of Kiev.

==First marriage==
In 1079, aged seven, Agnes was betrothed to Frederick, a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty; at the same time, Henry IV invested Frederick as the new duke of Swabia. The couple married in 1086, when Agnes was fourteen. They had two sons and three daughters: 
* Frederick II of Swabia
* Conrad III of Germany 
* Gertrud, who married Hermann III, Count Palatine of the Rhine 
* Heilika, who married Frederick III of Pettendorf-Lengenfeld-Hopfenche
* Richildis, who married Hugh I, Count of Roucy

In 1977, German genealogist and historian Hansmartin Decker-Hauff revealed the existence of several other children he claimed to have found in documents from the abbey of Lorch, the Staufers&#x27; family monastery. These claims were later exposed as forgeries. Historian Heinz Bühler&#x27;s suggestion that Berta of Boll, the wife of Count Adalbert of Elchingen-Ravenstein, was Agnes&#x27; and Frederick&#x27;s daughter is purely speculative.

==Second marriage==
Following Frederick&#x27;s death in 1105, Agnes married Leopold III (1073–1136), the Margrave of Austria (1095–1136). According to a legend, a veil lost by Agnes and found by Leopold years later while hunting was the instigation for him to found the Klosterneuburg Monastery.

Their children were:
* Adalbert
* Leopold IV
* Henry II of Austria
* Berta, married Heinrich III, Burgrave of Regensburg
* Agnes, &quot;one of the most famous beauties of her time&quot;, married Wladyslaw II of Poland
* Ernst
* Uta, married Luitpold I, Count of Plain
* Otto of Freising, bishop and biographer 
* Conrad, Bishop of Passau, and Archbishop of Salzburg
* Elisabeth, married Hermann, Count of Winzenburg
* Judith, married c. 1133 William V of Montferrat. Their children formed an important Crusading dynasty.
* Gertrude, married Vladislav II of Bohemia

According to the &quot;Continuation of the Chronicles of Klosterneuburg&quot;, there may have been up to seven other children (possibly from multiple births) stillborn or who died in infancy.

In 2013, documentation regarding the results of DNA testing of the remains of the family buried in Klosterneuburg &amp; Heiligenkreuz strongly favor that Adalbert was the son of Leopold and Agnes.

In 1125, Agnes&#x27; brother, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, died childless, leaving Agnes and her children as heirs to the Salian dynasty&#x27;s immense allodial estates, including Waiblingen.

In 1127, Agnes&#x27; second son, Konrad III, was elected as the rival King of Germany by those opposed to the Saxon party&#x27;s Lothar III. When Lothar died in 1137, Konrad was elected to the position.

<text>The Natural Step is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation founded in Sweden in 1989 by scientist Karl-Henrik Robèrt. The Natural Step is also used when referring to the partially open source framework it developed. Following publication of the Brundtland Report in 1987, Robèrt developed &quot;The Natural Step framework&quot;, setting out the &quot;system conditions&quot; for the sustainability of human activities on Earth; Robèrt&#x27;s four system conditions are derived from a scientific understanding of universal laws and the aspects of our socio-ecological system, including the laws of gravity, the laws of thermodynamics and a multitude of social studies.

The Natural Step has pioneered a &quot;Backcasting from Principles&quot; approach meant to advance society towards greater sustainability. Whole-systems thinking and backcasting from sustainability principles form the basis for numerous applications and tools to plan and (re-)design organisational strategy, organisational processes, product/service innovation and business models. Its biggest advantage is the concept of &#x27;simplification without reduction&#x27; to prevent getting lost in the details with the complex topic of sustainability. For almost 30 years, the approach has been implemented, proven and refined in education, research, businesses, municipalities, regional and national governments, inter-governmental organisations (e.g. UN, EU) and a multitude of NGOs around the world.

Currently, The Natural Step has offices in 9 countries and numerous associates and ambassadors in more than 50 countries. Next to the Five Level Framework and the TNS Framework (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development), the TNS &#x27;theory of change&#x27; shows an integrated cascaded approach to accelerate change towards a sustainable society by collaboration on individual, organisational and multi-stakeholder system level. Change programs and transition Labs include Future-Fit Business Benchmark and the Alberta, Canada energyfutureslab.

The Natural Step (TNS), an approach used to guide sustainability efforts in organizations, involves implicit and explicit precautions judgments that may limit growth. But these limits may be difficult for companies and individuals to adhere to. Some implicit precautions are that TNS avoids making judgments about specific levels of damage thresholds or critical concentrations because they are uncertain and can cause disagreements. TNS recommends actions to reduce dependence on certain materials and activities, but these recommendations assume that critical thresholds have already been breached. Some explicit precautions are TNS rate corollaries include avoiding the extraction, production, or dispersion of materials at a faster rate than their breakdown in nature and avoiding harvesting or manipulation of nature in a way that reduces productivity and diversity, and infrastructure development in human history would not have been possible had the TNS systems conditions and these first intended corollaries have been adhered to.

==Towards sustainability==
Sustainability essentially means preserving life on Earth, including humanity - or the well-being of the socio-ecological system and it&#x27;s subsystems over time. As also expressed in the 1987 Our common future report (a.k.a. the Brundtland report) meeting the needs of humans is central in sustainable development, however, it does not state &quot;which&quot; &quot;needs.&quot; Attempting to satisfy those human needs (whether &#x27;real&#x27; or created) also are the root causes of many of societal (incl. ecological) challenges we face today. The Natural Step differs between fundamental human needs and their satisfiers (Manfred Max-Neef) and between &quot;real needs&quot; and created desires.

The Natural Step believes the root causes for unsustainability should be taken into account when designing for sustainable solutions and satisfaction of fundamental needs. These root causes are derived from a scientific understanding of our socio-ecological systems – the interactions between humans in society and between humans, their organisations and the ecosystem.

It was found that ecosystem functions and processes are systematically altered in the following ways (thereby degrading the ecosystem services and resources they provide):
* Society mines and disperses materials from the lithosphere into the biosphere faster than they are returned to the Earth&#x27;s crust (examples include oil, coal, minerals such as Phosphors and metals such as mercury and lead).
* Society produces and concentrates substances faster than they can be broken down by natural processes — if they can be broken down at all (examples of such substances include plastics, dioxins, DDT and PCBs).
* Society encroaches on ecosystems faster than they can regenerate (for example, over-harvesting of natural resources including trees, fish, fresh water), or by other forms of ecosystem manipulation (for example, paving over fertile land or causing soil erosion).
Simultaneously, societal systems can be degraded by several factors (thereby eroding trust in the systems and trust in the individuals, organisations and institutes it consists of): 
* Society allows structural obstacles to: health (of individuals in the system); influence (of how the system is organised), competence (development to understand context and to become the best one can be); impartiality (equal treatment) and meaning-making (a larger purpose).

==Framework==

===Overview===
The 5 Level Framework (5LF) is a comprehensive model for planning and decision making in complex systems based on whole systems thinking. It comprises 5 levels: 1) System, 2) Success, 3) Strategic Guidelines, 4) Actions and 5) Tools. It can be used to analyze any complex system of any type or scale (e.g. human body, the game of chess or soccer, an organization, a sustainability concept) and helps to plan, decide and act strategically towards success based on principles determined by the working of the system (e.g. treat cancer, win chess or soccer, manage a successful business, design useful tools).

When the 5LF is applied to the socio-ecological system (or society within the biosphere) it is called the Natural Step Framework, or the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD). As a framework it helps to see the BIG picture of the workings and functions of our ecological and social systems and institutions, current trends and our sustainability challenge, how we as a society negatively influence the functioning of the socio-ecological system (System), what systems conditions should be met for it to not to be negatively influenced (Success) and how to strategically plan towards that (Strategic Guidelines) with prioritised actions (Actions) selecting (or designing) and applying the appropriate tools for those (Tools).

Since its creation by Dr. Karl Henrik Robert in 1989, the framework has been reviewed by many scientists, is under constant development and has been an inspiration to other tools and concepts in the area of sustainable development. The framework has been tested in hundreds of organizations (businesses, governments, neighborhoods, NGO&#x27;s) around the world. Based on experience with the framework specific guidelines, methods and applications have been developed and refined to accelerate and improve the application of the framework.

===FSSD System Level===

====The Sustainability challenge====
To explain the sustainability challenge, the metaphor of a funnel is used. The walls closing in represent the many (systematic and often exponentially increasing) trends impacting upon, and degrading, the system e.g.; decreasing number and quality of natural resources and ecosystems, the stricter laws and regulations, degrading interpersonal and person-to-person trust, increasing toxicity levels, growing human population, increase in demands for resources, etc. The walls of the funnel are getting closer and closer over time limiting the room to maneuver. Individuals, organisations and society are hitting the walls of the funnel over time e.g.: victims of climate change-related weather events, stricter laws and regulations, depleting fish stocks, increased number of cancer occurrences, air-, water-, soil pollution, erosion of trust, financial crises, bankruptcies due to price increases of scarce resources, land erosion, etc.

====Overview of the science - Systems functions====
Behind the framework there is a science-based understanding of the dynamic interrelationships within and between socio-ecological sub-systems and is based (a.o.) on study of ecosystems, laws of nature (including thermodynamics, conservation laws, laws of gravity, biogeochemical cycles, photosynthesis, systems thinking, flows of resources and wastes), social systems, social institutions (including trust and fundamental human needs), psychology.

In order to be able to create a structured overview and not to be confused with more downstream or detailed information only the logic of the concepts are explained here.

====Ecological System====
Earth&#x27;s biosphere is an &quot;open system&quot; with regards to energy. Energy comes in the form of sunlight and energy leaves in the form of heat radiation. Earth&#x27;s biosphere is a (relatively) closed system regarding matter, some meteorites and dust enter and only limited matter leaves due to gravity (e.g. some space rockets, dust).

The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics (LoTD) and Laws for conservation of matter (LCoM) set limiting conditions for life on earth: The First Law says that energy is conserved; nothing disappears, its form simply changes (e.g. heat, movement). Another way of stating this is: &quot;Energy cannot be created, or destroyed, only modified in form.&quot; The implications of the Second Law and second law of conservation of matter, are that matter and energy tend to disperse over time. For matter this is referred to as &quot;entropy.&quot; Putting the different laws together and applying them to our planetary system, the following facts become apparent:
* All the matter that will ever exist on earth is here now (1st LCoM).
* Disorder increases in all closed systems and the Earth is a closed system with respect to matter (2nd LCoM). However, it is an open system with respect to energy since it receives energy from the sun, and radiates waste heat to space. 
* Sunlight, or energy radiation, (LoTD) is responsible for almost all increases in net material quality on the planet through photosynthesis and solar heating effects. Chloroplasts in plant cells take energy (and minerals and oxygen) from sunlight for plant growth (Sugars, structure, oxygen). Plants, in turn, provide energy for other forms of life, such as animals. Evaporation of water from the oceans by solar heating produces most of the Earth&#x27;s fresh water. This flow of energy from the sun creates structure and order from the disorder.
* The global ecosystem and its local ecosystems evolved over time into a complex adaptive system with many interdependencies.

====Social system====
A social (sub-)system also is a complex adaptive system. Trust is essential in the smooth workings of societal systems and can be seen as the glue binding society (economically, politically, socially). A lack of trust, e.g. in the future and each other, creates societal unrest and instability as individuals and (sub-)systems within society will attempt to continue to satisfy Individual fundamental human needs (as articulated by Manfred Max-Neef, among others).

Being able to keep one&#x27;s health, influence of how the system is organised, learn &amp; develop to become the best one can be; equal treatment and pursuing a larger purpose are important factors to trust and &#x27;believe in&#x27; the system one is part of.

====Human influence====
Based on the whole-system understanding and research focusing on the causes rather than the effects of &quot;unsustainability&quot; within the socio-ecological system lead to 8 main causes of unsustainability.

These main causes of unsustainability are in two groups of, as follows:

* The &quot;ecological system&quot; is systematically subject to:
# Concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth&#x27;s crust (e.g. mining of fossil fuels, metals, minerals)
# Systematic increases in concentrations of substances produced by society (e.g. creation of plastics, toxins, purified substances, sugar, nanochemicals)
# Systematic increases in physical degradation of ecosystems (e.g. deforestation, over-harvesting, fishing methods, unnatural barriers, introduction of exotic species, leakages of extracted or created substances)

* The people in the &quot;social systems&quot; are systematically subject to barriers to trusting relationships, due to structural obstacles to:
# Health, i.e. injury and illness (physical, physiological, psychological, emotional) (e.g. dangerous working contortions or insufficient rest) 
# Influence, i.e. inability to participate in shaping the social systems of which they are a part (e.g. suppression of free speech, opinions ignored) 
# Competence, i.e. inability to develop and increase proficiency individually or together (e.g. obstacles to education - informal, formal or professional)
# Impartiality, i.e. treated differently for any reason other than competency (e.g. sexism, racism, homophobia, classism, etc.)
# Meaning-making, i.e. hindered from creating and co-creation meaning in our lives (e.g. suppression of cultural expression, etc.)

These latter 5 are the result of recent research led by Dr Merlina Missimer. By providing significant granularity on the root causes of &quot;social system&quot;unsustainability, it is increasingly replacing the previous single, and very high-level, cause of social system unsustainability:
* Systematic increases in setting barriers for peoples capacity to meet their needs (e.g. inequality, discrimination, long working hours, access to healthcare, torture, right to demonstrate or vote, land grabbing, corruption, deny education). For example the Future-Fit Business Benchmark uses the 8 causes of unsustainability.

Previously, these were called the &quot;system conditions&quot; to be met so as not to degrade the socio-ecological system.

===FSSD Success Level===
In 1989, Robèrt wrote a paper describing the system conditions for sustainability, given these laws of nature amongst others. He sent it to 50 scientists, asking that they tell him what was wrong with his paper. On version 22, Robèrt had scientific consensus on what was to become &quot;The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD)&quot; (Originally &quot;The Natural Step Framework&quot;. This was first published in a peer-reviewed academic journal in 1991 under the title &quot;From the Big Bang to Sustainable Societies&quot;.

Since then there have been 2 more rounds of scientific consensus on the Framework, one was initiated by Paul Hawken in the USA (1994), one took place in Australia. Since the initial version several changes to the wording of the principles have been made (2001, 2006, 2015)., and an ongoing program of additional research, application and practice around the world.

====Sustainability principles====
The current FSSD&#x27;s definition of sustainability includes eight &quot;sustainability principles&quot; (first order scientific principles) or &quot;criteria for redesign&quot;. The first three are ecological sustainability principles, the latter five as social sustainability principles. Together they describe a strongly sustainable society within a strongly sustainable ecological system:

&quot;&quot;In a sustainable society nature is not subject to systematically increasing concentrations of…&quot; 
#&quot;… substances extracted from the Earth&#x27;s crust;&quot;
#&quot;… substances produced as a byproduct of society;&quot;
#&quot;… degradation by physical means,&quot;

&quot;…and people are not subject to structural obstacles to…&quot;
#&quot;… health;&quot;
#&quot;… influence;&quot;
#&quot;… competence;&quot;
#&quot;… impartiality; and&quot;
#&quot;… meaning-making&quot;

Again, the last five social sustainability principles extended a single social sustainability principle:(Missimer, et al.,2017) 
:&quot;and in that society… people are not subject to conditions that systematically undermine their capacity to meet their needs.&quot;(Henrik Ny, et al., 2006)

The eight sustainability principles can be reworded, to simplify understanding and to apply to any society, organization or product. In short, to become a sustainable society we must:
#&quot;… eliminate our contribution to the progressive buildup of substances extracted from the Earth&#x27;s crust; &quot;
#&quot;… eliminate our contribution to the progressive buildup of chemicals and compounds produced by society; &quot;
#&quot;… eliminate our contribution to the progressive physical degradation and destruction of nature and natural processes; and &quot;
#&quot;… eliminate our contribution to structural obstacles to: health; influence; competence; impartiality and; meaning-making.&quot; [4]

The negative wording is often debated as the use of &#x27;not&#x27; can have a negative emotional connotation. As in a game with game rules, it doesn&#x27;t tell you everything you &quot;should&quot; do, they leave that up to the imagination of the players, they allow you to do anything as long as it is within all agreed rules of the game. The restrictions set by these &#x27;rules of the game&#x27; stimulate creativity as they are applied in personal, professional or community planning and decision-making. On the success level organizations, institutes and individuals add their own (secondary) principles of success based on their specific context or needs.

===FSSD - Strategic Level===

==== Strategic ====
Often confused with Strategy. To be able to be strategic, one needs to know where one wants to be or where one is heading.

====Backcasting====

The framework bases its planning approach on a concept called &quot;backcasting&quot; and more specifically &quot;backcasting from sustainability principles&quot;. Backcasting is the process of moving backwards from an imagined vision of success. One begins with an end in mind, moves backwards from the vision to the &quot;present&quot;, and moves step-by-step towards the vision. It is essentially placing ourselves in the future, imagining that we have achieved success and looking back to ask the question: “What do we need to do today to reach that successful outcome?”. Instead of picturing how success could look like, backcasting is advocated from a principled vision of success in which specific conditions are met creates a shared understanding of success.

Different general strategies can be applied to reach success based on a general understanding of the system including: 
* Dematerialisation across the entire life cycle of a product or process. 
* Substitution of materials that do not comply with the sustainability principles by those that do. 
* Applying the &quot;precautionary principle&quot;
* Applying the &#x27;&quot;Golden rule&quot;&#x27; (&quot;&#x27;do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you&quot;&#x27;)

===FSSD - Actions===
The actions that you can do within the strategy to reach success within the system e.g. Raise awareness on specific sustainability topics, education programs on what sustainability is and how it could be approached, selecting different suppliers based on sustainability criteria, designing or implementing policies, analyze the life cycle of a product, create a sustainability report, facilitate a dialogue with specific stakeholders around a particular challenge, etc.

===FSSD - Tools Level===
A variety of tools and concepts can be supportive when addressing sustainability. Informed by the framework and priorities of actions can help to select and implement the appropriate tools. Tools can then be optimally used: for the purpose they were designed to do together with other complementary tools.

====ABCD Method====
The ABCD method is the approach with which the framework backcasting from the 8 sustainability principles can be applied to an organization. The letters represent the following steps (FSSD academic ABCD and TNS ABCD method differ slightly):

A: Awareness and visioning. After understanding the system your organization works within and the principles, members of the organization create a vision on how they would like the organization to be. Organisations should also identify the service they provide, independent of the product, sparking more creative goals.

B: Baseline assessment. The organisation analyses and maps what it has been doing currently and evaluates it based on the 4 principles. It allows for the organisation to identify critical issues, implications and opportunities.

C: Creative solutions. Members of the organisation brainstorm for solutions to the issues raised previously, without constraint. With the vision and potential actions, organisations backcast to develop strategies for sustainability.

D: Decide on priorities. The organisation prioritizes the different actions developed previously that help gear it to sustainability in the fastest and most optimal way, by asking a set of questions: by asking: 
i) Does this action move us in the right direction? 
ii) Can this action be built upon in future? 
iii) Does this action bring an acceptable financial, ecological and/or social return on investment?. This step involves step-by-step implementation and planning.

Backcasting is continually used to assess and evaluate the actions, to determine if the organisation is moving towards the vision set in &#x27;A&#x27;.

====Interfaces with other tools and concepts====
Much research has been done on the interfacing of the FSSD with other known tools and concepts within the sustainable development arena (Interfaces with most sustainability tools and concepts have been described).
Below various examples:
* Factor X; Factor 4; Factor 10; biological footprinting; IS0 14001; EMAS; EMS 
* Global Reporting Initiative - Mind The Gap! Strategically Driving GRI Sustainability Reporting Towards Sustainability.

====Tools based on the Framework====
Furthermore, various tools and other forms of support have been developed by and in collaboration with TNS. Others have been inspired by, or based upon the TNS framework, some more rigorous than others.
Below various examples:
* &quot;Future-Fit Business Benchmark&quot; co-developed with TNS practitioners
* &quot;Strategic Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA)&quot;
* &quot;VinylVerified Product Label&quot; a product label for specific PVC building applications in Europe.
* Living Building Challenge (LBC) 
* Sustainable Apparel Coalition Higgs Index, or Materials Sustainability Index as originally developed by Nike in collaboration with The Natural Step.

==Applications of the Framework==
The framework is applicable to organisations (of any sector, size, location), processes, products, services, business models. It can be used to analyse other sustainability tools and concepts and strengthens other tools by placing them in the context and focus on what they are designed to do.

When applied correctly, also the business case for sustainability and the sustainability case for business are taken into account to create inspiring cases and best practices. Sustainable Growth Associates, representing The Natural Step Germany adapted the generic ABCD approach into an ADVISE approach applicable to business strategy.

==On making change happen==
In an article in &quot;In Context&quot; (1991), Robèrt described how &quot;The Natural Step Framework&quot; would create change:

Eco-municipalities, based on the Natural Step&#x27;s system conditions, originated in Sweden. Over 80 municipalities and several regions (25 percent of all Swedish municipalities) have adopted the TNS sustainability principles based on the system conditions. There are now 12 eco-municipalities in the United States and the American Planning Association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles. Communities such as Whistler and Dawson Creek,

In addition to the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, corporations such as Interface, Nike, Inc., ICI Paints, Scandic Hotels, Max Hamburgers, and IKEA have also adopted the framework and have become more sustainable as a result. Each of these companies have completely re-thought their business and have examined and changed all their processes including purchase of materials, manufacturing, transportation, construction of facilities, maintenance and waste management.

The Natural Step was introduced to the Northwest region of the United States through three one-day conferences introduced by Northwest Earth Institute.

<text>Cecil Edwin Webber (sometimes known by the nickname &quot;Bunny&quot;; 9 April 1909 – 26 June 1969) was a British television writer and playwright. He is best remembered as one of the co-creators of the science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; while working as a staff writer for the BBC in the early 1960s.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
Webber participated in many crucial early development meetings, and co-wrote the first format document for the series with Donald Wilson and Sydney Newman. Webber and his scripts were ultimately not used as he was felt to not be capable of &#x27;writing down&#x27; to the level required of the programme. However, his draft script for the proposed first episode formed the basis of the broadcast first episode eventually written by Anthony Coburn. Webber received a co-writer&#x27;s credit on internal BBC documentation for the episode, although not on screen.

Webber submitted a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; pilot entitled &quot;Nothing at the end of the Lane&quot;, suggested in early May 1963 under the programme&#x27;s developing format guide. The story would feature Biddy and her teachers, Lola and Cliff, who would encounter Biddy&#x27;s grandfather, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and his time machine. &quot;Nothing at the end of the Lane&quot; was soon replaced by Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Giants&quot;, which would be a four-part serial to be directed by Rex Tucker. The story would feature Lola and Cliff in search of their student, Sue, and meet an old man in the fog. Calling him &quot;Dr. Who&quot;, they find out that his home is a time machine disguised as a police telephone box. Unexpectedly, they are shrunken to an eighth of an inch in size. They then go to Cliff&#x27;s laboratory and are menaced by a microscope lens, spiders, a student&#x27;s compass, and caterpillars. Cliff manages to communicate with the students, and both return to Dr. Who&#x27;s time machine.

In production, the names of the companions changed to Ian, Barbara and Susan, while the Doctor&#x27;s name, &quot;Dr. Who&quot;, would go unused. &quot;The Giants&quot; was abandoned in June 1963 in favour of &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;, because &quot;Doctor Who&quot; creator Sydney Newman disliked the idea of putting caterpillars and spiders as monsters in the story.

==Other work==

Webber&#x27;s published stage plays included &quot;Be Good, Sweet Maid&quot; (1957), &quot;Out of the Frying Pan&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Mortal Bard&quot; (1964).

Other television shows he wrote or created for the BBC included the 1961 action adventure serial &quot;Hurricane&quot;, the 1962 children&#x27;s comedy &quot;William&quot;, starring Dennis Waterman, based on the books by Richmal Crompton, and in 1964 episodes of the &quot;Thorndyke&quot; detective series.

<text>Santha Rama Rau (24 January 1923 – 21 April 2009) was an Indian-born American writer.

==Early life and background==

While Santha&#x27;s father was a Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin from Canara whose mother-tongue was Konkani, her mother was a Kashmiri Brahmin from the far north of India, who had however grown up in Hubli.

In her early years, Rama Rau lived in an India under British rule. When aged 5 and a half, with her 8-year-old sister Premila, she briefly attended an Anglo-Indian School where the teacher anglicized their names. Santha&#x27;s name was changed to Cynthia and her sister&#x27;s was changed to Pamela. The environment there they found to be condescending, as their teacher told them that &quot;Indians cheat&quot;. They walked home, and never returned to that school. The incident was recounted in Rama Rau&#x27;s short memoir entitled &quot;By Any Other Name&quot;.

==Career==
When India won its independence in 1947, Rama Rau&#x27;s father was appointed as his nation&#x27;s first ambassador to Japan. While in Tokyo, Japan, she met her future husband, an American, Faubion Bowers. After extensive traveling through Asia and a bit of Africa and Europe, the couple settled in New York City, New York. Rama Rau became an instructor in the English language faculty of Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York, in 1971, also working as a freelance writer.

She adapted the novel &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, with author E. M. Forster’s approval, for the theater. The play of the same name was produced for the Oxford Playhouse, Oxford, United Kingdom, moved to the West End in London, United Kingdom, in 1960 for 261 performances, and then on to Broadway in New York City where it was staged 109 times. It was adapted by John Maynard and directed by Waris Hussein for BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; in 1965. Although the film rights originally required Rama Rau to write the screenplay, director David Lean found her draft unsatisfactory and was able to reject it, although she is still credited in the titles because he still used some of her dialogue.

Rama Rau is the author of &quot;Home to India&quot;, &quot;East of Home&quot;, &quot;This is India&quot;, &quot;Remember the House&quot; (a novel), &quot;My Russian Journey&quot;, &quot;Gifts of Passage&quot;, &quot;The Adventuress&quot;, (a novel), &quot;View to the Southeast&quot;, and &quot;An Inheritance&quot;, as well as co-author (with Gayatri Devi) of &quot;A Princess Remembers: the memoirs of the Maharani of Jaipur&quot;.

==Personal life==
She married Faubion Bowers in 1951 and had one son, Jai Peter Bowers in 1952. The couple divorced in 1966. In 1970, Rama Rau married Gurdon B. Wattles, and had no children. Faubion Bowers died in November 1999.

<text>Queen is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located under Yonge Street north from Queen Street to Shuter Street.

== History ==
Queen Station opened in 1954 as part of the original stretch of the Yonge subway line from to stations. The original address given to the station, 171 Yonge Street, is still commonly used in Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) system maps, but this address is not used for any nearby buildings and points to the actual intersection. The address provided by the TTC website, 3 Queen Street East, is located across from the Maritime Life Tower, by the 1 Queen Street East subway entrance.

In 1997, this station became accessible with elevators.

On December 13, 2013, the Toronto Police were called in after gun shots were fired on board a subway train at the station. The Passenger Assistance Alarm was pressed, and the station was evacuated soon after. A man in his 20s was shot and was rushed to nearby St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital in life-threatening condition, but stable on the day after. The station continued to be closed on December 14, 2013, with subway service from to stations being replaced by shuttle bus service.

===Lower Queen===
Early subway expansion plans called for an east–west subway for streetcars under Queen Street, and a lower Queen station for these was roughed-in under the subway station. Priorities changed and the line was never built, but many people unknowingly pass through this lower station every day; two pedestrian tunnels, which go under the Line 1 tracks to allow riders to move between the northbound and southbound platforms, use portions of this intended station, with most of the excess infrastructure walled off. The roughed-in streetcar station is reached from a locked door along one of the pedestrian tunnels. The second pedestrian tunnel occupies the westbound streetcar platform area. An elevator shaft occupies part of Lower Queen. The streetcar platforms are low-level and short in length.

What exists is a roughed-out second set of platforms built underneath a currently-operating station. It is located directly underneath the existing station. The station was designed as part of a planned but never-built streetcar subway that would have run east and west along Queen Street. A similar station was planned underneath the existing (also situated along Queen Street). Although underground pipes and conduits were specifically routed around this intended site, construction was never started.

The trackway was planned for streetcars rather than dedicated subway trains, similar to the much newer streetcar-only underground track originating at Union station used for the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront routes. The Queen subway would have allowed streetcars from the 501 Queen, 504 King, 503 Kingston Road, and 505 Dundas to avoid centre-city traffic, and then surface to run on regular streets in outlying areas.

The plan to build a streetcar subway under Queen Street was delayed and then cancelled in favour of an east–west line further north, which became Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. As a result, the Lower Queen Station was never put into service. Unlike the abandoned platform at Lower Bay, this station is not used in any way save as an occasional storage facility and film set, and the aforementioned pedestrian tunnels.

There are plans to use space within Lower Queen to facilitate passenger transfers between Line 1 and the future Ontario Line, which would be drilled out of rock at a lower level.

==Station description==

The station lies under Yonge Street north of Queen Street to Shuter Street. The station has seven entrances from street level, which includes accessible entrances from inside the Eaton Centre and the Maritime Life Tower. Other entrances include a sidewalk staircase entrance from Shuter Street, and other entrances from 1 Queen Street East, 8 Queen Street West, by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street, and from the north entrance outside the Eaton Centre.

Below street level are the concourses, with one above and across the north end of the platforms and at the south there is one on each side at track level with an underpass to connect them.

The only tenant in the station is Gateway Newstands, and there is one located on both platforms inside the fare-paid area.
== Architecture and art ==

The station contains painted murals by John Boyle at the platform level entitled &quot;Our Nell&quot;, featuring depictions of Nellie McClung, William Lyon Mackenzie, as well as the former Simpson&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s department stores.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Queen Street store, the south end of the Eaton Centre, the Old City Hall courts, Nathan Phillips Square, Toronto City Hall, the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres, and Massey Hall.

==Surface connections==

A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:
TTC routes serving the station include:
== Future ==

Metrolinx plans to construct the Ontario Line – a rapid transit line connecting the south loop of Line 1 Yonge–University to the east wing of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth and north to Science Centre station, where the line will interchange with Line 5 Eglinton. The preferred route of the line is from Science Centre to Exhibition. Queen station is a planned station on this new line and will make use of the roughed-in section of Lower Queen station to facilitate passenger transfers between Line 1 and the new line. The Ontario Line would be drilled out of rock at a lower level.

<text>Northeastern University station (signed as Northeastern) is a surface-level trolley stop on the MBTA Green Line. It is located in a dedicated median along Huntington Avenue in Boston, between Opera Place and Forsyth Street, and is adjacent to the Krentzman Quad on the campus of Northeastern University. It is the first surface-level stop going outbound along the Green Line E branch; trolleys rise from a portal located between Opera Place and Gainsborough Street and continue along the surface down Huntington Avenue towards Mission Hill.

==History==

Until the completion of the Huntington Avenue subway from to a portal near Opera Place on February 16, 1941, streetcars ran on the surface from the Boylston Street portal. With the completion of the tunnel, Opera Place became an important short turn location; a siding was constructed adjacent to the inbound track. On May 21, 1947, the Boston Elevated Railway board voted to change the name from Opera Place to Northeastern University to reflect the growth of the adjacent Northeastern University. The stop was named on maps as early as the 1951, while most other surface stops did not appear separately until around 1990.

Like other surface stops on the median-reservation section of the line, Northeastern University station had bare asphalt platforms. In 1972, the MBTA began planning a reconstruction of that section of the line, then scheduled for 1973–74. The Northeastern siding was to be moved into the reservation, with a footbridge installed near the station for students. The work (minus the footbridge) were eventually done in 1980, when the line was closed to modify the track and wires for the new LRVs. The line was cut back to Symphony on March 21, 1980; it was re-extended to Northeastern (using LRVs) on June 21 and Brigham Circle on September 20. The platforms at Northeastern were lengthened and paved with brick.

In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility as part of the Light Rail Accessibility Program. The platforms at Northeastern were lengthened to Forsyth Street and repaved with concrete; temporary platforms northeast of Opera Place were used during the renovations. That renovation — part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations — was completed on May 26, 2003. On August 23, 2004, a Type 8 Breda low-floor LRV derailed at the station, causing scarring in the outbound platform near the pedestrian crossing on the Opera Place side of the station.

<text>Dundas is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the intersection of Yonge Street and Dundas Street.

==History==
Dundas Station opened in 1954 as part of the original stretch of the Yonge subway line from to Eglinton station. The original address, 300 Yonge Street, is still commonly used in TTC system maps.

When Toronto&#x27;s Eaton Centre was built in the 1970s, a pedestrian tunnel was constructed under the tracks outside the fare-paid areas, connecting the two separate concourses. The station was refurbished in 1982, with the original Vitrolite tiles being replaced with yellow ceramic tiling.

On September 27, 1997, 23-year-old Charlene Minkowski was killed when she was pushed onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train at Dundas by Herbert Cheoung, a diagnosed schizophrenic. Cheoung was given a sentence which included no parole for 15 years.

As part of the construction of Yonge–Dundas Square in the early 2000s, a new entrance staircase was created, giving access to the station directly from the square. In 2002, this station became accessible with the addition of elevators.

Following controversy over the namesake of Dundas Street, Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who delayed the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, Toronto City Council voted in 2021 to rename Dundas Street and other civic assets named after Dundassuch as Dundas station. A new name will be chosen in April 2022. In December 2023, Toronto City Council passed a motion which directed the TTC board to rename the station by the fourth quarter of 2024. Toronto Metropolitan University expressed an interest in covering the $1.7-million cost associated with the renaming of the station if it is named after the university.

==Station description==

The station is located under Yonge Street at Dundas Street and is built on three levels, with entrances on every corner of the intersection. and all being accessible except for the northwest one, which is a sidewalk staircase at the Atrium on Bay. The southeast, southwest, and northeast entrances are located at Yonge Dundas Square, in the Eaton Centre and at 10 Dundas East inside the Cineplex Cinemas building respectively. All elevators that connect the entrance to the station are not provided by the TTC, but by the respective managements.

Dundas is the only station in Toronto where the northbound and southbound platforms are in separate fare-paid areas, owing to the constrained space and difficult geology at this location. Separate street entrances had to be used for each direction until the Eaton Centre was built, at which time a tunnel was constructed under the tracks outside the fare-paid areas, which is considered the third level. If on the wrong platform, passengers (including Presto card holders) can take a transfer from the transfer machines available on the platform, exit the station, and re-enter the station on the other platform by showing the collector at the booth the transfer obtained.

The station has underground connections to the Toronto Eaton Centre, 10 Dundas East and the Atrium on Bay, and is one of five stations connected to PATH.

==Architecture and art==
The station features William McElcheran&#x27;s &quot;Cross Section&quot;, located by the northwest entrance and along the under-platform crosswalk. It depicts a vibrant urban scene of pets, shoppers, businessmen and other commuters. The piece was created out of terra cotta and fired in two-foot-square tiles. The artwork was donated by Atrium on Bay in May 1984.
==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
North of the station, the subway continues to travel through its tunnels underneath Yonge Street, passing over a double crossover, before entering College station. South of the station, it continues underneath Yonge Street, over Lower Queen station, before fully entering Queen station.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include Yonge-Dundas Square, the north end of the Eaton Centre, the former Toronto Coach Terminal, Toronto City Hall, the Ed Mirvish Theatre, and 10 Dundas East. Buildings on the campus of Toronto Metropolitan University surround the station to the west, north and east. Nearby public art galleries include the Image Centre and Gallery Arcturus.

== Surface connections ==
A transfer is required to connect between the subway system and these surface routes:

<doc id="1304271" wikidata="Q1043002" url="?curid=1304271" title="Shekere">
<text>The shekere (from Yoruba Ṣẹ̀kẹ̀rẹ̀) is a percussion instrument consisting of a dried gourd with beads or cowries woven into a net covering the gourd. There are multiple ways to produce sounds with the instrument. It can be shaken or hit against the hand. The instrument can also rest in the palm of one hand while other hand holds the handle of the gourd. A twisting wrist motion is used so that the gourd moves while beads remain in place causing friction and sound different than when the instrument is simply shaken or struck. The shekere originated in Yorubaland West Africa, which comprises the countries of Nigeria, Benin, and Togo. 

While originating with the Yoruba people, the instrument is common throughout West Africa and Latin America and is central to folk music traditions of many cultures as well as well as being utilized within some popular music styles. In Ghana the instrument is referred to as axatse. In Latin America the instrument is commonly known as cabaça. Other names for the instrument include afuxê, afoxé, cabaca, cabasa, and cabaza depending on the language and culture.

The shekere is made from vine gourds that grow on the ground. The shape of the gourd determines the sound of the instrument. A shekere is made by drying the gourd for several months then removing the pulp and seeds. After it is scrubbed, skillful bead work is added as well as colour.

==Varieties==
In Cuba, the chekeré, also known as &quot;aggué&quot; (abwe), is a large, hollow gourd (~50 cm long, approx. in) almost entirely surrounded by a network of cords, to which many coloured beads are attached. Widely used in Afro-Cuban sacred and popular music, it may be twisted, shaken or slapped producing a subtle variety of effects; musically, it is more flexible than maracas.

In Brazil, this African gourd rattle is called a xequerê. It consists of the gourd (&quot;cabaça&quot;) cut in the middle and then wrapped in a net in which beads or small plastic balls are threaded. The afoxé is a similar, smaller instrument.

<text>Blida () is a city in Algeria. It is the capital of Blida Province, and it is located about 45 km south-west of Algiers, the national capital. The name &quot;Blida&quot;, i.e. &quot;bulaydah&quot;, is a diminutive of the Arabic word &quot;belda&quot;, city. 

==Geography==
Blida is known as the city of roses because of the large number of roses in its gardens.

Blida lies surrounded with orchards and gardens, above the sea, at the base of the Tell Atlas, on the southern edge of the fertile Mitidja Plain, and the right bank of the Oued el kebir outflow from the Chiffa gorge. The abundant water of this stream provides power for large corn mills and several factories, and also supplies the town with its numerous fountains and irrigated gardens. Within Blida is Chréa National Park, one of the largest national parks in the country and part of the Atlas Mountains. Blida is surrounded by a wall of considerable extent, pierced by six gates, and is further defended by Port Mimieh, crowning a steep hill on the left bank of the river.

The nearby Chiffa gorge is a habitat of the endangered Barbary macaque, &quot;Macaca sylvanus&quot;; the habitat is one of only a few locations where populations of the primate are found.

===Climate===
In Blida, there is a Mediterranean climate. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Csa. The average annual temperature in Blida is . About of precipitation falls annually.

==History==

No ancient center preceded the city. It was identified with the town of Mitidja in the Middle Ages which was ruined during the Beni Ghania campaigns. The present town was founded by Moors in the 16th century.

The town was rebuilt according to a grid plan following an earthquake in 1825 on a site about a mile distant from the ruins. It numbers among its buildings several mosques and churches, extensive barracks and a large military hospital. The principal square, the place d&#x27;Armes, is surrounded by arcaded houses and shaded by trees. The center of a fertile district, and a post on one of the main routes in the country, Blida has a flourishing trade, chiefly in oranges and flour. The orange groves contain over 50,000 trees, and in April the air for miles round is laden with the scent of the orange blossoms. In the public gardens is a group of magnificent olive trees. The products of the neighboring cork trees and cedar groves are a source of revenue to the town. Sidi Ahmed El-Kebir, Blida&#x27;s founder, is buried in Sidi El-Kebir (an area named after him). He founded Blida in the 16th century.

A mosque was built by order of Khair-ed-din Barbarossa, and under the Turks the town was of some importance. It was intricately rebuilt of interconnecting alleyways and streets, and was made accessible through the existing six major gates. The gates were as follows: 
*Bab Er-Rahba
*Bab Ed-Zair
*Bab El-Khouikha
*Bab Es-Sebt
*Bab Ez-Zaouia
*Bab El-Kbour
*Bab El-Kseb

Today those gates no longer exist, but their names are still in use by people in Blida as reference points to locate streets, places, schools and businesses.

In 1867, another earthquake damaged Blida.

Blida Province is home to a number of Berber-speaking tribes &amp;towns. The Berbers of Blida are known as Djebailia and have been in the plains of Blida/Matija for thousands of years according to historians such as Ibn khaldoun. The tribes are Beni Salah (Ith salah), Beni Misrah (Ith Misra), Ghalia and many more. They speak Taqbaylit the language of the Kabyle which is the Berber language of blida close to the Kabyle varieties spoken east of Algiers Province, It is 95% identical and has traditionally been seen as an intermediate between Kabyle and the Chenoua language native to the north-eastern part of the country.

== Notable locations ==
* Stade Mustapha Tchaker in Blida is the current exclusive home stadium for the Algeria national football team. This has been the case since it was opened in 2002, Algeria have however also played many of their home games away from Tchaker throughout their history, both in friendly matches and for competitive tournaments.

* Al-Kawthar Mosque is located in the center of the city at the Bin Merah Square, known as the famous square of the Toot in Blida. The mosque is distinguished by its space as it attracts more than 12 thousand worshipers on religious occasions.
* Place Toute is located in the center of Blida located near Bab Es-Sebt, Al-Kawthar Mosque, and the old market. Tourists and locals can enjoy the many cafes, pastry shops, ice cream shops, and other restaurants while their children play in the plaza.
