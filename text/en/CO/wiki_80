<text>Albert Jaime Grassby, AM (12 July 1926 – 23 April 2005) was an Australian politician who served as Minister for Immigration in the Labor Whitlam government. He completed reforms in immigration and human rights, and is often known as the father of Australian &quot;multiculturalism&quot;. He gained notoriety by acting as an agent of influence for the Calabrian Mafia that murdered anti-drugs campaigner Donald Mackay.

==Early life and state politics==
He was born Albert Jaime Grassby in Brisbane, Queensland to parents of Spanish and Irish descent. His family lived in the United Kingdom during the 1930s and 1940s, and Albert was educated partly at schools in England. During World War II, his father was killed in a German air raid. After he turned 18, Grassby joined the British Army, serving in both infantry units and the British Intelligence Corps (1945–46).

Following the end of the war, Grassby returned to Australia, working as a journalist and information officer for the CSIRO in Griffith, New South Wales. In 1965, Grassby was elected as Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly for the electorate of Murrumbidgee representing the Labor Party. Grassby served as Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Conservation between 1968 and 1969. His high profile and popularity in the local community encouraged him to enter federal politics.
==Federal politics==
Grassby won the rural electorate of Riverina for the Labor Party at the 1969 federal election. He was the seat&#x27;s first Labor MP in 24 years, and only the second in 47 years. Following Gough Whitlam&#x27;s victory at the 1972 election, Grassby was appointed Minister for Immigration. In this role, Grassby became one of the more high-profile members of the Whitlam ministry, and was best known for his role in the initiation of multiculturalism in Australia and the ending of the White Australia policy. This is notwithstanding that in 1966, the Holt Liberal Government introduced the Migration Act 1966, a watershed moment in immigration reform, it effectively dismantled the White Australia policy and led to a large increase in &quot;non-white&quot; immigration. It was not until the Fraser Liberal government&#x27;s review of immigration law in 1978 that all selection of prospective migrants based on country of origin was entirely removed from official policy.
Grassby did however push for more immigration from non-English-speaking countries, &quot;banned racially selected sporting teams from playing in Australia and repealed the law that required Indigenous Australians to seek permission before going overseas.&quot;

As the White Australia policy had been formally revoked in 1973, Grassby&#x27;s actions provoked disquiet among sections of the Australian community, including in his Riverina electorate and some of his ALP colleagues, who thought his reforms too radical for the period. However, Grassby could point to his enormous popularity within multicultural Australia and the subsequent growth of support for the ALP from this section of the community as more than adequate recompense for any possible loss of support from white Australia.

In addition to his high-profile crusade for multiculturalism, Grassby also gained wide attention for his flamboyant dress sense, with his colourful ties and suits setting him apart from the unwritten dress code for politicians of sombre dark suits and plain ties.

Grassby&#x27;s actions attracted criticism from anti-immigration groups, led by the Immigration Control Association, which targeted his electorate in a campaign at the May 1974 election. Partly as a result, Grassby was defeated by the National Party candidate, John Sullivan, by just 792 votes. Grassby and his supporters accused these groups of mounting a smear campaign against him.

==Commission for Community Relations==
Following his defeat, Grassby was appointed as the first federal Commissioner for Community Relations, administering the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which he had championed while in parliament. While he continued to work towards a multicultural Australia, Grassby could not escape controversy. In one case, Grassby nominated for preselection for the safe federal Labor seat of Parramatta following encouragement from Whitlam, who sought to return Grassby to the ministry. However, Grassby surprisingly lost the preselection ballot, because many rank-and-file Labor members objected to an outside candidate being foisted upon them.

In another case, he became entangled in one of the more sensational political cases of Australian history when he hired Junie Morosi to work at the Commission for Community Relations, which brought her into contact with a number of government ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Jim Cairns. Cairns appointed Morosi as his Principal Private Secretary, a job traditionally held by a senior public servant. The ensuing controversy surrounding the appointment led to the downfall of Cairns, and, while Grassby was not guilty of any misconduct himself, he attracted criticism by his connection to the case.

Grassby resigned in the wake of the Nagle inquiry, which found he had been involved in the attempts to table false claims about murdered political candidate Donald Mackay&#x27;s family.

==Writer==
Grassby published a number of books, including a biography of early Australian Prime Minister Chris Watson and various studies of multiculturalism in Australia.

==Honours==
In recognition of his pioneering work on immigration, Grassby was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1985. He received the United Nations Peace Medal in 1986.

==Legal action==
In 1980, Grassby was charged with criminal defamation when it was alleged that he had asked a New South Wales state politician, Michael Maher, to read in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly a document that imputed that Barbara Mackay and her family solicitor were responsible for the disappearance (and probable murder) of her husband Donald Mackay, a prominent Riverina businessman who had been a Liberal candidate against Grassby in 1974. Maher, when asked why Grassby had made the request, replied that it was a matter of his own Sydney electorate&#x27;s demographics: &quot;I had the biggest concentration of Italians in Haberfield, Five Dock, Concord and Drummoyne. He [Grassby] thought I could play the Italian vote.&quot; Grassby maintained his innocence and fought a twelve-year battle in the courts before he was eventually acquitted on appeal in August 1992. He was awarded $180,000 in costs. Grassby had already lost a civil suit filed by Barbara Mackay, forcing him to unconditionally apologise.

==Death and subsequent media reports==

Al Grassby, who had been treated for cancer, died on 23 April 2005, two days after suffering a heart attack, after several months&#x27; pneumonia. He was survived by his wife Ellnor Grassby and his daughter Gabriella Davis, and his partner of 25 years, Angela Chan.

After Grassby&#x27;s death, a number of revelations were made in the media, particularly in relation to his links with the Calabrian Mafia (known as the &#x27;Ndrangheta) in Griffith and to the events surrounding the murder of Donald Mackay. Beginning on 9 May 2005, the Melbourne &quot;Herald Sun&quot; ran a series of articles alleging that Grassby used his influence to thwart a National Crime Authority investigation into the Mafia, and to &quot;let mafia criminals into Australia&quot;, and that he was &quot;paid to do the mafia&#x27;s bidding&quot;, including receiving a $40,000 payment from the Griffith Mafia to smear Barbara Mackay.

Giafranco Tizzoni, a Mafia supergrass, identified Grassby as being at the &quot;beck and call&quot; of the Calabrian Mafia for at least 40 years. According to the National Crime Authority, the Mafia funded Grassby&#x27;s election campaigns. One of Al Grassby&#x27;s closest associates was Toni Sergi, the man identified in court and in Parliament as the Mafia leader who ordered the execution of Donald Mackay.

A decision, in 2007, by the Australian Capital Territory&#x27;s Labor Chief Minister Jon Stanhope to erect a statue of Al Grassby in Canberra has been the subject of some controversy. Grassby&#x27;s various criminal connections were featured in the television crime drama &quot;Underbelly&quot;.

<text>Intercooler is a rock band out of Brisbane, Australia

==Biography==
Intercooler was formed by members of a Sunshine Coast band named Uncle Ecstasy. They have released three full-length albums – &quot;Old School Is The New School&quot; (released 2002, and re-issued, with a different track listing, in 2006), &quot;Forever Or Whatever&quot; (released in 2007), and &quot;Time To Let Go&quot; (released September 2011). Intercooler have also released two EPs – &quot;Goodness of the Girl&quot;, and &quot;Dance of a Thousand Promises&quot; (2004).

Intercooler was formed in 2001 when Damon Cox paired up with already established songwriting trio Phil Ballantyne, Joel Potter and Michael Caso (later replaced by Darek Mudge of Screamfeeder). They all had the same affinity for rock music and so decided to form the band Intercooler as their genre was chosen for them.

After completing their first album, Intercooler toured up and down the east coast of their home country of Australia, playing shows with the likes of The Casanovas, Dallas Crane, Peabody, Grinspoon, The Living End and claiming prime international support slots with Teenage Fanclub, Buzzcocks, J Mascis, Gomez, Maxïmo Park, Preston School of Industry and The Delgados.

Four songs from Intercooler&#x27;s album &quot;Old School Is The New School&quot; were added to high rotation on national radio network Triple J, including live favourites &quot;Goodness of the Girl&quot; and &quot;Leaflet&quot;. Videos were shot for two of the tracks and both enjoyed airplay on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fly TV&quot;, &quot;rage&quot; and also Channel [V]. Intercooler was responsible for knocking Jennifer Lopez off the pole position on Fly TV&#x27;s buzz clip of the week, as voted by viewers.

Intercooler continued on to play the Queensland leg of the Big Day Out and Livid music festivals in 2003. Their first U.S. tour commenced in September of the same year. They supported Red Hot Chili Peppers and Queens of the Stone Age at their Washington, D.C. show plus appeared at Wisconsin&#x27;s renowned Summerjam festival. The tour also included their own club shows in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and more.

2004 saw the release of the EP &quot;Dance of a Thousand Promises&quot; which spent 41 weeks in the top 20 of the Australian Independent Charts and had two songs added to high rotation nationally. Videos for &quot;Cream Puff&quot; and &quot;If I Try&quot; both enjoyed airplay on rage, MTV Australia and Channel [V].

The video for &quot;Carving Others&quot;, from their &quot;Forever Or Whatever&quot; album, was released in February 2007.

Their music video for &quot;You&#x27;re Not Gonna Hurt Us Again&quot; was a Finalist for &#x27;Best Music Video&#x27; at the Australian Effects &amp; Animation Awards. Directed by Michael Ebner the video stars pro skateboarding star, Corbin Harris and screened at Dendy Cinemas, Rage and other music channels.

<text>Trap shooting is one of the three major disciplines of competitive clay pigeon shooting. The other disciplines are skeet shooting and sporting clays.

Trap shooting is distinguished by the targets being launched from a single &quot;house&quot; or machine, generally away from the shooter, compared with skeet shooting where targets are launched from two &quot;houses&quot; crossing in front of the shooter. Sporting clays involve a more complex course, with many launch points.

==Participation==

Trap shooting is practiced all over the world but is most popular in the United States (particularly the Midwest), Canada and Europe. Trap shooting variants include, but are not limited to, international varieties Olympic trap, also known as &quot;International Trap&quot;, &quot;Bunker&quot;, &quot;ISSF Trap&quot;, &quot;Trench&quot;. Non-Olympic shooting variants include Down-The-Line, also known as &quot;DTL&quot;, Nordic Trap, and double trap. American Trap is the predominant version in the United States and Canada.

American Trap has two independent governing bodies. The Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA) sanctions events throughout the United States and Canada, as well as the Pacific International Trapshooting Association (PITA) which sanctions events on the West Coast of North America.

==History==
Trap shooting was originally developed, in part, to augment bird hunting and to provide a method of practice for bird hunters. Use of targets was introduced as a replacement for live pigeon-shooting. Indeed, one of the names for the targets used in shooting games is &quot;clay pigeons&quot;. The layout of a modern trap shooting field differs from that of a skeet field and/or a sporting clays course.

Trap shooting has been a sport since the late 18th century when real birds were used; usually the now-extinct passenger pigeon, which was extremely abundant at the time. Birds were placed under hats or in traps which were then released. Artificial birds were introduced around the time of the American Civil War. Glass balls (Bogardus) and subsequently &quot;clay&quot; targets were introduced in the later 1800s, gaining wide acceptance.

==Equipment==

Trap shooting is typically shot with a 12 gauge shotgun. Smaller gauge firearms (e.g. 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 gauge and .410 bore) can be used, but no allowance is given. Trap shooting is shot at either single or double target presentations. This refers to the number of clay targets which are launched simultaneously.

Both general purpose shotguns and more specialized target-type shotguns are used in trap shooting, and may be double-barreled or single-barreled. Shooters who shoot all sub-events will often buy a combination-set of a single and double barrel for shooting both singles and double targets respectively. Semi-automatic shotguns are also popular for recreational shooting due to the lower perceived recoil and versatility because they can be used for singles, handicap, and doubles. Shotguns used in trap shooting can differ from field and skeet guns in several ways and normally are designed with a higher &quot;point of impact&quot; as the targets are intended to be shot as they rise.

Trap shooting shotguns can be adjustable. Stocks may have a &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; (fixed, raised &quot;comb&quot;) configuration and/or include a comb height adjustment, a butt plate adjustment for length, angle, or both. Trap guns typically have longer barrels of , possibly with porting and featuring tighter chokes to compensate for the longer distances at which trap shooting targets are broken. The majority of trap shotguns built today feature interchangeable choke tubes as opposed to older guns, which used chokes of a &quot;fixed&quot; constriction. Interchangeable choke tubes can come in a variety of constrictions and may use names such as &quot;modified&quot;, &quot;improved cylinder&quot;, and &quot;full&quot;. Trap guns are built to withstand the demands and stress of constant and lengthy repeated use—hundreds of shots in a single day of events, whereas typical field guns are built to be lighter, carried afield, and not shot in such quantity.

Common accessories include wearing a vest or pouch that will hold at least 25–50 cartridges. Most ranges and clubs require eye and ear protection due to the extremely loud environment and possible danger of using firearms.

Shooting glasses may be something as simple as the eyeglasses or sunglasses one presently wears. However, this is generally considered unsafe as standard eyeglasses and sunglasses are often not shatter proof. Specialized shooting glasses typically have interchangeable colored lenses, are adjustable, and are designed for high-impact resistance. A spectrum of different colored lenses are offered to compensate for light conditions as well as enhance the color of the target thrown while muting the color of the background. Adjustable glasses allow on-range changes for conditions of light, color, etc.

Hearing protection also comes in a variety of styles. Dense foam and electronics are used to reduce sound levels. Typical hearing protection is either an &quot;earmuff&quot; (worn over the ear) or an &quot;ear plug&quot; (worn in the ear canal). Some shooters use both simultaneously to gain greater noise reduction (NRR). There are also &quot;ear plugs&quot; molded to the shape of the ear, which can be used for listening to music while shooting.

===Trap machines and target launching methods===

Trap shooting requires the use of a target throwing device(s). American trap and DTL utilize a single trap machine, which is typically enclosed within a traphouse, downrange from the shooters&#x27; shooting positions. The house provides protection for the machine (e.g. from weather and errant shots) and also acts to obscure the machine&#x27;s oscillating throwing position. International or Olympic trap employs 15 trap machines housed within a large elongated traphouse recessed into the ground to form a &quot;bunker&quot; which resembles a trench. International or Olympic trap may at times be referred to as bunker trap.

Modern automatic throwing machines can store hundreds of clay targets in a carousel and systematically self-load targets onto the throwing mechanism. Manual electric target throwers require a person in the trap house with the trap machine to set the target(s) by hand onto the machine arm. For both types, an electrical signal, from the push of a button or a sound-activated device, causes the trap machine to throw its targets after the shooter calls for their bird(s).

Temporary or informal trap shooting can utilize other methods to launch targets. The simplest is a &quot;hand thrower&quot; which is a hand-held arm which holds and releases that target when a person swings it. Another type of manual, non-electrical thrower utilizes a spring-loaded mechanism that is cocked and subsequently released by hand or foot.

==Ammunition==


Trap typically uses lead shot ammunition, with shot sizes (for lead shot) ranging between #7 ½ and #9 (2.0–2.4 mm). The major components of a shotgun cartridge are the &quot;hull&quot; (casing), &quot;primer&quot; (ignition device), &quot;powder&quot; (smokeless gunpowder), &quot;wad&quot; (shot cup and cushion), and &quot;shot&quot; (round pellets).

The &quot;shot&quot; consists of approximately 300–450 small spheres. Cartridges are allowed a maximum payload weight of of shot. Velocity may vary but is limited based upon shot mass: for , for , and for . Maximum loads are generally only needed for longer &quot;handicap&quot; yardages or the second shot in double trap. Steel shot, which may be required at certain trap clubs or ranges, is used with slightly larger shot size (e.g. #6 or #7).

Reloading or self-loading of ammunition is popular among a segment of trap shooters, due in part to the sheer quantity of ammunition used in trap shooting as well as the fact that many ranges will have casings that are used only once and are able to be obtained by people who reload their own cartridges at little to no cost.

==History==
Trap shooting has been around since the 18th century. A publication known as &quot;Sporting Magazine&quot; states that by the year 1793, trap shooting was &quot;well established&quot; in England. The first recorded organized trap shooting in the United States is likely to have taken place at the Sportsman&#x27;s Club of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1831. Originally, live birds were used as targets, released from under hats. Glass balls came into use as targets in the 1860s and began to partially replace live birds, but live targets are still used in some parts of the United States. The glass ball targets were invented by Charles Portlock, of Boston, and were used by notable shooters such as Annie Oakley, Doc Carver, and Capt. A. H. Bogardus. Most of the glass ball targets were made of colorless glass and had a diameter of . Some targets were filled with colored powder to indicate a hit and add a visual effect. For the shooters who liked live game sport, targets were filled with feathers.

Bogardus took up glass ball and clay pigeon shooting in 1868, and went on to win many championships. He was known as one of the most successful trap shooters in the early years of the sport. In the spring of 1883, he was defeated by a competitive shooter named Doc Carver. Carver idolized Bogardus and other renowned shooters. He attempted to attract the great Bogardus, but it wasn&#x27;t until six years later that the two legends finally came together for a match, and the winner was the less-experienced Doc Carver. Carver won 19 out of 25 matches. In most of those matches they used Ligowsky targets.

In 1880, &quot;clay&quot; birds (disks) were invented by a man named Fred Kimble, although George Ligowsky took credit for the invention. The Ligowsky target was used widely in the early trap shooting community as a replacement for the glass ball targets. The downside of the Ligowsky targets was that they were too hard to break when hit. Fred Kimble made a more breakable target. Unlike the Ligowsky target, which was made of hard baked clay, the Kimble target was made of coal-tar, pitch, and other ingredients.

There were many different types of target throwers, also known as “traps,” like one made by Bogardus, which was made to throw glass targets. This trap was able to throw the targets for a distance of . It was operated by a person behind the shooter, who pulled a string and released an elastic spring, launching the target. The first automatic trap machine to launch clay targets was used in 1909. Following the invention of the automatic trap machines, doubles trap was introduced. It was a big success in the competition community. In the 1912 Olympics, Jay Graham became the first American to win the gold medal in doubles trap.

Three years later, in 1915 the American Amateur Trapshooting Association (AATA) was formed with John Philip Sousa as president. This organization was the first organized and run by amateurs. When the AATA was disbanded in 1919, it was absorbed by an organization called the American Trapshooting Association. In 1923, the American Trapshooting Association was renamed Amateur Trapshooting Association, and the same organization is still active today.

==International versions==
===Olympic trap (bunker trap)===
Olympic trap, also known as international and/or bunker trap, is one of the ISSF shooting events, introduced to the Olympic program in 1900; the current version was introduced in 1950. In international competitions the course of fire is 125 shots for men and 75 shots for women. There is a 25-shot final for the top six competitors.

Olympic trap uses 15 fixed-angle machines as opposed to the single oscillating machine used in American trap or DTL. The 15-machine, computer-controlled program is designed to deliver 10 left, 10 right and 5 straight-away targets to each competitor in a randomized sequence. A microphone release system is employed to provide uniformity in target release times.

The process of a round is as follows: There are six shooters, one to each station, with the sixth shooter initially starting at a holding station immediately behind shooter number one. At the beginning of first round of the day, test firing is allowed at the referee&#x27;s permission. Upon receiving the start signal, the first shooter has 10 seconds to call for his target. After firing at his target, the first shooter waits for the second shooter to complete firing, then moves to station two, with the shooter on station six smoothly moving to station one. This procedure continues through the squad until the completion of the round.

Generally, the round is refereed by a person on the line, behind the shooters. They use a bicycle-type horn, or similar, to signal lost targets. The referee is assisted by one or two flankers to either side of the bunker who keep score. With modern technology, computer screens may be used both at the bunker and in the club house to show the rounds&#x27; progress. In major matches, there is a board, perhaps , to one side that shows the scoring status clearly to all with large tiles: white to show hits, red to show misses.

The guns may be loaded—but open-actioned—between stations 1 through 5. Guns must be unloaded and open in the walk from station five back to one. The unloading must be done &quot;before&quot; the shooter makes the turn to step off station five. This open action requirement alone tends to discourage the use of auto-loading shotguns, as it is time-consuming to unload if the second shell is not used. Additionally, there are issues of reliability and the loss of the advantage which a more open choke of the over-under shotgun type can provide for the first shot.

Since the UIT, now ISSF, mandated the 24 gram (7/8 ounce) shot load in 1991, chokes have tended to become tighter. Often competitors will use for the first barrel and for the second. Guns are regulated to shoot dead on or, at most high. Considerable effort is expended to ensure a perfect fit as the relatively high exit speed of the target allows no time for conscious compensation of a poor fit as it so often can occur in the slower exit speed target games of American trap and skeet.

===Double trap===
Double trap is a relatively new trap form. An Olympic event since 1996 (from 2008 it has Olympic status only for men), two targets are thrown simultaneously but at slightly different angles from the station three bank of machines. The target speed is about , very close to that of ATA doubles.

The only unique item is that the targets are released with a variable delay up to 1 second. This was instituted to minimize the practice of spot-shooting the first target.

The ISSF has continuously adjusted the difficulties of its disciplines (trap, skeet, and double trap) to minimize the number of perfect scores, unlike ATA/NSSA where perfect scores are the norm. Missing a single target in a large ATA or NSSA match means the competitor has a limited chance of winning, whereas missing a target in Bunker or International Trap still allows a competitor a good shot at victory.

With her victory in women&#x27;s skeet shooting at the 2012 London Olympic games, Kim Rhode became the first American to win medals in five successive Olympic games. Her prior Olympic medals were for doubles trap shooting in 1996, 2000, and 2004 and for skeet shooting in 2008.

==Nationally and regionally recognized versions==
===American trap===
American trap is popular throughout the United States and may be the most popular form of clay target shooting in North America. It is widely practiced at clubs and facilities that offer trap shooting.

Trap shooting outside of any official event is common and arguably the majority of American trap shooting. Most official events are governed by the Amateur Trapshooting Association or ATA and its rules. The ATA is the primary governing body of American trap shooting and is one of the largest shooting sports organizations in the world. The Pacific International Trap Association (PITA) is an independent governing body, and is active in the western US and British Columbia. PITA rules are nearly identical to ATA rules. Trapshooting outside of official events follows ATA rules and norms to widely varying degrees.

The ATA hosts the Grand American World Trap Shooting Championships, which is held every August. After decades in Vandalia, Ohio, the &quot;Grand&quot; moved to the new World Shooting and Recreational Complex in Sparta, Illinois. The Grand attracts 4,500 (2015 numbers) shooters for the thirteen-day event. It was billed as the world&#x27;s largest shooting event until the USA High School Clay Target League&#x27;s Minnesota State Championship held in Alexandria, MN reached over 5,000 participants in June, 2015. The Grand American is still the largest ATA event.

The ATA sanctions registered trap shooting competitions at local clubs and facilities throughout North America, and it coordinates Zone competitions leading up to the Grand American each summer along with &quot;Satellite Grands&quot; throughout the U.S. State organizations hold state championship shoots each year, which are coordinated with and sanctioned by the ATA.

American Trap is broken down into three categories: singles, doubles, and handicap. The targets are thrown by a machine located at approximately ground level and covered by a &quot;trap house.&quot; For singles and doubles, there are five &quot;stations&quot;, each behind the trap house. In singles, each competitor shoots at five targets from each station. The trap machine oscillates left to right within a 54 degree arc (up to 27 degrees right and left of center), and at least a 34 degree arc (up to 17 degrees right and left of center)., and the competitor does not know where in that arc the target will emerge. In doubles, the machine does not oscillate, but throws two targets simultaneously with each competitor shooting at five pairs (10 targets) from each station. In the handicap events, the machine operates the same as in singles, but the shooters stand farther away from the trap house.

Recent changes specify a minimum handicap yardage of . Each time a competitor wins an event or shoots a score of 96 or higher, s/he may earn additional yardage (also known as &quot;getting a punch&quot;), and must thereafter shoot from farther away from the traphouse. The increase in effective distance is designed to increase difficulty. The maximum distance at which a handicap sub-event is shot is . Safety regulations prohibit members of a handicap squad from shooting at varying yardages of more than apart, depending upon the handicap classification. In American Trap, each shooter is allowed only one shot per target. Unless the target was an illegal target, in which case the target is either broken or has broken regulations the shooter may reshoot that bird.

When shooting American Trap for practice or fun, a squad of up to five individuals will shoot a &quot;round&quot; of trap which equals 25 targets per participant. Registered ATA events may require each shooter to shoot 50, 100 or 200 targets, depending upon the scheduled sub-event. Many of these shoots are for personal average or handicap yardage.

ATA rules specify that shotgun gauges larger than 12 gauge (such as 10 gauge) are not permissible. Maximum shot velocity is 1290 FPS (Feet Per Second) for shot charges up to 1 1/8 oz. and 1325 FPS for shot charges up to 1 oz.

A variant of standard trap is Wobble or Wobble trap. The main difference is a more variable target flight path than in standard trap shooting because the trap machine oscillates up and down as well as side to side. Shooters are allowed two shots per pull, and shooters at stations 1 and 5 stand at the mark while positions 2–4 stand at the mark. Although this version of trap is not sanctioned by the ATA, many shooters consider it to be both more challenging and engaging as well as a more realistic preparation for bird hunting.

===Other nationally and regionally recognized forms===
Down-The-Line (DTL) is a form of trap popular in Great Britain, Australia, and South Africa. The trap machine oscillates left to right within a 45 degree arc and each competitor shoots in turn, then moves station after having attempted 5 targets from each station in each round of 25 targets. Two shots are permitted at each target, but second shots incur a points penalty. 3 points are awarded for each first-barrel hit, 2 points for a second-barrel hit, and 0 for a miss. A perfect score in a 100-target competition is written as 100/300. The points score, rather than the number of targets hit, determines the winner and is used to determine classifications (AA, A, B and C class).

In the Nordic countries and Great Britain (which is part of the Nordic Shooting Region), a form of trap formerly known as &quot;Hunter&#x27;s trap&quot; and now as Nordic trap is popular. It is easier than the Olympic version.

==Technique==
The technique for trap shooting is fundamentally different from rifle or pistol shooting. The latter shoots one projectile and aims to place accurately at a usually stationary target, and usually with at least a few seconds to aim. Trap shooting involves shooting hundreds of pellets at a time, at a target that is moving quickly downrange, and often quickly laterally, typically with less than a second to move the gun and fire. Most shotguns have a bead at the end of the rib, located on top of the barrel(s), and a smaller bead halfway down the rib, used for aiming the firearm. Instructors generally refer to the process as &quot;pointing&quot; the shotgun rather than aiming it.

==Champion shooters==
Notable champion shooters include:
* Capt. Adam Henry Bogardus, born on a farm on Ravine Road in 1834, became the World Champion and United States Champion trap shooter. He is credited with romanticizing trap shooting and he invented the first practical glass ball trap in 1877. He and his sons were renowned crack shots that toured with the Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. He is in the Trapshooting Hall of Fame.
*William Frank Carver, &quot;Doc&quot; William Frank Carver (1840–1927), defeated Captain Adam Henry Bogardus, World Champion and United States Champion trap shooter, 19 times in a series of 25 matches.

* Vic Reinders (1906–1995), won eleven Grand American championships, including the Clay Target Championship in 1958, and has the distinction of being on more All-American teams than any other shooter in history. He is a member of the Trapshooting Hall of Fame, the Wisconsin Trapshooting Association Hall of Fame, and the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame.
*SFC Glenn Eller, won the gold medal in double trap at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and has won double trap gold 12 additional times in International Shooting Sport Federation sanctioned events.
*Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, won the silver medal while representing India in double trap at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and won gold medals in double trap in 2004 and 2006 ISSF World Cup events. He is a two-time winner of the Commonwealth Games gold medal in individual double trap.
*Harlan Campbell Jr., won over 125 Grand American awards, including three All-Around and two High Overall championships, and over 60 Satellite Grand titles. He is a member of the Trapshooting Hall of Fame and the Kansas Trapshooting Association Hall of Fame.
*Kim Rhode, a six-time U.S. Olympic medal winner (1996–2016 games) including three gold medals and six-time national champion in double trap. She won a gold medal in skeet shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics, equaling the world record of 99 out of 100 clays.
*Susan Nattrass O.C. Ph.D., born in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Competing at an elite international level since 1970s, Nattrass has had multiple appearances, in one or both of trap or double trap, at Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, World Championships, and Pan American Games. Nattrass is a 7-Time World Champion and repeat medalist at the Commonwealth Games, World Championships, and Pan American Games. As of the 2012 Olympics, Nattrass is one of only 122 athletes (and one of only 46 still active), all sports, to compete in at least six Olympic Games, appearing in 1976, &#x27;88, &#x27;92, 2000, &#x27;04 and &#x27;08. She won a gold medal at the World Championships in 1974, &#x27;75, &#x27;77, &#x27;78, &#x27;79, &#x27;81, and 2006. She is also a member of the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame and the Amateur Trapshooting Association Hall of Fame.

==Youth shooting in the United States==
Trap shooting is becoming ever more popular among younger shooters. There are a number of programs geared towards encouraging youth shooting.

The USA High School Clay Target League is the largest youth clay target shooting program in the world, with nearly 50,000 participants yearly. The USAHSCTL runs high-school trap shooting leagues in various states nationwide, the largest of which is Minnesota, where 12,000 students from nearly 450 schools compete. All teams in USAHSCTL leagues are school-sanctioned as a prerequisite for team/league formation. The Minnesota State High School Clay Target League Championship is the largest trap shooting event in the world with over 8,000 student athletes participating in 2018. The League&#x27;s motto is &quot;Safety, Fun, Marksmanship - In that order.&quot;

The Scholastic Clay Target Program (SCTP) is the second largest clay target program in the country, with just under 15,000 participants. SCTP promotes gun safety, personal responsibility, and sportsmanship among primary and secondary students. Teams compete at the local, state, and national level. Athletes are divided into four divisions based on academic grade level and experience: Rookie (fifth grade and below), Intermediate (sixth through eighth grades), Junior Varsity (ninth through twelfth grades), and Varsity (eleventh and twelfth grades with at least two years of experience at the Junior Varsity level). Trophies and college scholarships are awarded to third place, runner-up, and champion squads in each division at the SCTP National Championships, which are held concurrently with the first two days of the Grand American Trapshooting Championships in Sparta, Illinois.

The Amateur Trapshooting Association launched its youth program, AIM in October 2008. With about 3000 participants, the program, focusing on academics, integrity, and marksmanship, seeks to provide a safe and positive experience with firearms for youth, elementary through college age. AIM encourages good sportsmanship and personal responsibility through competition in order to make trap shooting a lifelong avocation. Categories and classes are designed to create a more level playing field and encourage genuine competition. Age based categories are established on the birthday of the shooter. Categories are Pre-Sub (11 and under), Sub-Junior (12–14), Junior (15–18) and Graduates/Collegiate (18–23). For purposes of determining age category the category declared by the participant on the first day he/she shoots shall be used. AIM Shooters have the opportunity to compete at local and State/Provincial levels as well as at the Grand American World Trapshooting Championships. The AIM Program offers the opportunity to compete in a unique sport that is heavily reliant on mental focus as well as enjoy the thrill and excitement of registered trap shooting.

To encourage young shooters, the ATA provides &quot;special categories&quot; for younger shooters who compete at ATA events. These categories include &#x27;Junior&#x27; class for shooters who have not turned 18, and &#x27;Sub-junior&#x27; for those not yet 15 as of the beginning of the ATA trap year (September 1). The ATA also allows shooters under the age of 18 to shoot for half-price at the Grand American as well as many other large ATA sponsored shoots. The ATA and state organizations such as the Texas Trapshooters&#x27; Association (TTA) award scholarships to college bound trap shooters based on citizenship, scholarship, and need. Numerous former TTA junior shooters are now attending college with the help of TTA and ATA scholarships.

Additionally, non-scholarship college teams are growing in popularity. Leading college trap teams include those from Texas A &amp; M, Purdue, Virginia Tech, and Lindenwood (MO). Teams from these schools dominate the U.S. intercollegiate trap championships.

<text>USS &quot;Mero&quot; (SS-378), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the mero, any of several large groupers found in warm ocean waters.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Mero&quot; was laid down by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 22 July 1944; launched on 17 January 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Henry G. Taylor; and commissioned at Manitowoc on 17 August 1945. She was the last submarine built at Manitowoc.

==Operational history==
===United States Navy===
&quot;Mero&quot; got underway for shakedown in Lake Michigan 25 August; thence, between 6 September and 17 November she cruised the Great Lakes and visited several ports including Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago. The Mero tied up at The Michigan Avenue bridge in Chicago and was open to visitors who were allowed aboard for a tour of the boat. Placed in floating drydock 9 November – 2 November, she reached New Orleans via the Mississippi River 29 November, on 6 December sailed for the Canal Zone, trained there a month, then sailed for Pearl Harbor 19 January 1946.

&quot;Mero&quot; reached Pearl 5 February and operated out of there until sailing for the west coast 22 February. Arriving San Francisco Bay 1 March, after preinactivation overhaul, she steamed to Mare Island 14 March to join the 19th Fleet, and decommissioned there 15 June 1946. Assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, she remained berthed at Mare Island until converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine in 1960.

=== Turkish Navy ===
On 20 April 1960, &quot;Mero&quot; was transferred on loan to Turkey under the Military Assistance Program. The Turkish Navy renamed her TCG &quot;Hızırreis&quot; (S 344). After her voyage from San Francisco, &quot;Hızırreis&quot; was commissioned into Turkish Navy service on 23 August 1960.

On 1 August 1973, &quot;Hızırreis&quot; was formally sold to Turkey and struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register. She was discarded by the Turkish Navy in 1977 and used for spare parts.

<doc id="1301147" wikidata="Q1444457" url="?curid=1301147" title="Frank Wildhorn">
<text>Frank Wildhorn (born November 29, 1958) is an American composer of both musicals and popular songs. His musical &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; ran for four years on Broadway. He also wrote the hit song &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot; for Whitney Houston.

==Early years==
Wildhorn was born in Harlem and spent his childhood in Queens before moving to Hollywood, Florida, at age 14. Soon after he taught himself how to play the piano, Wildhorn realized he wanted to compose music. During high school, he played in and wrote for various bands, ranging from rock and roll to Rhythm and blues to jazz. He attended Miami-Dade College for two years before transferring to the University of Southern California, where he studied history and philosophy. He started writing &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; with Steve Cuden, who was working at USC when Frank was a student. He is Jewish.

==Career==
===Popular music===
In the popular music arena, Wildhorn has worked with such artists as Stacy Lattisaw, Natalie Cole, Kenny Rogers, Trisha Yearwood, Tracy Lawrence, Trace Adkins, Patti LaBelle, Dennis DeYoung, and Linda Eder, to whom he was married. His &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot; was an international number one hit for Whitney Houston in 1988.
Wildhorn is Creative Director of Atlantic Theatre, an Atlantic Records division that develops new American musicals. In 2005, he co-founded GlobalVision Records with long-time collaborator Jeremy Roberts. GlobalVision releases include a new concept recording of &quot;Dracula, the Musical&quot; and a new studio recording of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde: Resurrection&quot;.

===Stage===
In 1999, Wildhorn had three shows running simultaneously on Broadway: &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; at the Plymouth Theatre, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; at the Minskoff Theatre, and &quot;The Civil War&quot; at the St. James Theatre; however, all three shows closed without making a profit, for a total loss approaching $20 million. In 2004, he collaborated with Don Black and Christopher Hampton on a musical based on &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Wildhorn has become a prominent composer globally, with many productions in Europe and Asia having long runs. &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; is one of the longest running musicals of all time in South Korea. The musical &quot;Carmen&quot;, with music by Wildhorn and lyrics by Jack Murphy, premiered in Prague in October 2008. The musical &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, music by Wildhorn with book and lyrics by Jack Murphy, received a workshop reading in November 2008, and opened at the Theatre of St. Gallen, Switzerland in March 2009. Another musical, with music by Wildhorn and lyrics by Don Black, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, received an industry reading in February 2009 and premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in California in November 2009. Also in November 2009, another new musical, &quot;&quot; premiered at the David A. Straz, Jr. Center for the Performing Art in Tampa, Florida, with another production following at the Alley Theatre, Houston, Texas, in January 2010.

Wildhorn is also the first Broadway musician to work with the Takarazuka Revue on the Cosmos Troupe&#x27;s production of the musical &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;.

Other musicals include &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;, which ran in 2003 at the Goodspeed Opera House and a short developmental run at the NYMT Festival in 2004, and &quot;Waiting for the Moon&quot; starring Lauren Kennedy and Jarrod Emmick in New Jersey in 2005, with the musical being renamed &quot;Zelda&quot; for a run at Flatrock Playhouse in 2012. In 2015, Wildhorn created a musical based on the popular Japanese manga series &quot;Death Note&quot; (this would lead to more manga adaptations, such as &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; in 2021 and &quot;Your Lie In April&quot; in 2022). In 2018, he debuted &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; in South Korea, based on Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel. &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; won three awards at the 2019 Korean Musical Awards, including Best Musical.

===Other compositions===
Wildhorn composed a full-length commissioned symphonic piece, &quot;Danube Symphony&quot;, which was recorded by the 96-piece Vienna Symphony. A CD of the work was released on December 10, 2021. The premiere took place on 3rd November 2022 in Wiener Musikverein.

==Personal life==

<text>Palmoplantar keratodermas are a heterogeneous group of skin disorders characterized by abnormal thickening (scleroderma) of the stratum corneum of the palms and soles.

Autosomal recessive, dominant, X-linked, and acquired forms have all been described in medical literature.

== Types ==
Clinically, three distinct patterns of palmoplantar keratoderma may be identified: diffuse, focal, and punctate.

===Diffuse===

Diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma is a type of palmoplantar keratoderma that is characterized by an even, thick, symmetric hyperkeratosis over the whole of the palm and sole, usually evident at birth or in the first few months of life. Restated, diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma is an autosomal dominant disorder in which hyperkeratosis is confined to the palms and soles. The two major types can have a similar clinical appearance:
* &quot;Diffuse epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot; (also known as &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma cum degeneratione granulosa Vörner&quot;, &quot;Vörner&#x27;s epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, and &quot;Vörner keratoderma&quot;) is one of the most common patterns of palmoplantar keratoderma, an autosomal dominant condition that presents within the first few months of life, characterized by a well-demarcated, symmetric thickening of palms and soles, often with a &quot;dirty&quot; snakeskin appearance due to underlying epidermolysis.
* &quot;Diffuse nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot; (also known as &quot;Diffuse orthohyperkeratotic keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Keratosis extremitatum progrediens&quot;, &quot;Keratosis palmoplantaris diffusa circumscripta&quot;, &quot;Tylosis&quot;, &quot;Unna–Thost disease&quot;, and &quot;Unna–Thost keratoderma&quot;) is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition and is present from infancy, characterized by a well-demarcated, symmetric, often &quot;waxy&quot; keratoderma involving the whole of the palms and soles.

===Focal===
Focal palmoplantar keratoderma, a type of palmoplantar keratoderma in which large, compact masses of keratin develop at sites of recurrent friction, principally on the feet, although also on the palms and other sites, a pattern of calluses that may be discoid (nummular) or linear.
* &quot; Focal palmoplantar keratoderma with oral mucosal hyperkeratosis&quot; (also known as &quot;Focal epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Hereditary painful callosities&quot;, &quot;Hereditary painful callosity syndrome&quot;, &quot;Keratosis follicularis&quot;, &quot;Keratosis palmoplantaris nummularis&quot;, and &quot;Nummular epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;) is an autosomal dominant keratoderma that represents a clinical overlap syndrome with pachyonychia congenita type I but without the classic nail involvement.

===Punctate===
&quot;Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma&quot; is a form of palmoplantar keratoderma in which many tiny &quot;raindrop&quot; keratoses involve the palmoplantar surface, skin lesions which may involve the whole of the palmoplantar surface, or may be more restricted in their distribution.
* Type 1: &quot;Keratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris&quot; (also known as &quot;Autosomal-dominant hereditary punctate keratoderma associated with malignancy&quot;, &quot;Buschke–Fischer–Brauer disease&quot;, &quot;Davis Colley disease&quot;, &quot;Keratoderma disseminatum palmaris et plantaris&quot;, &quot;Keratosis papulosa&quot;, &quot;Keratoderma punctatum&quot;, &quot;Keratodermia punctata&quot;, &quot;Keratoma hereditarium dissipatum palmare et plantare&quot;, &quot;Palmar and plantar seed dermatoses&quot;, &quot;Palmar keratoses&quot;, &quot;Papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma&quot;, &quot;Punctate keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Punctate keratoses of the palms and soles&quot;, and &quot;Maculosa disseminata&quot;) is a skin condition, an autosomal dominant palmoplantar keratoderma with variable penetrance, characterized clinically by multiple, tiny, punctate keratoses over the entire palmoplantar surfaces, beginning over the lateral edge of the digits. It has been linked to 15q22-q24.
* Type 2: &quot;Spiny keratoderma&quot; (also known as &quot;Porokeratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris&quot;, &quot;Punctate keratoderma&quot;, and &quot;Punctate porokeratosis of the palms and soles&quot;) is an autosomal dominant keratoderma of late onset that develops in patients aged 12 to 50, characterized by multiple tiny keratotic plugs, resembling the spines on a music box, involving the entire palmoplantar surfaces.
* Type 3: &quot;Focal acral hyperkeratosis&quot; (also known as &quot;Acrokeratoelastoidosis lichenoides&quot;, and &quot;Degenerative collagenous plaques of the hand&quot;) is a late-onset keratoderma, inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, characterized by oval or polygonal crateriform papules developing along the border of the hands, feet, and wrists. It is considered similar to Costa acrokeratoelastoidosis.

===Ungrouped===
* &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma and spastic paraplegia&quot; (also known as &quot;Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease with palmoplantar keratoderma and nail dystrophy&quot;) is an autosomal dominant or x-linked dominant condition that begins in early childhood with thick focal keratoderma over the soles and, to a lesser extent, the palms.
* &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma of Sybert&quot; (also known as &quot;Greither palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Greither syndrome&quot;, &quot;Keratosis extremitatum hereditaria progrediens&quot;, &quot;Keratosis palmoplantaris transgrediens et progrediens&quot; &quot;Sybert keratoderma&quot;, and &quot;Transgrediens and progrediens palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant keratoderma (a skin condition involving horn-like growths) with symmetric severe involvement of the whole palmoplantar surface in a glove-and-stocking distribution. It was characterized by Aloys Greither in 1952. It was characterized by Virginia Sybert in 1988. An autosomal recessive form which is known as Mal de Meleda has been described. This is associated with mutations in the Secreted Ly-6/uPAR-related protein 1 (SLURP1) gene.
* &quot;Striate palmoplantar keratoderma&quot; (also known as &quot;Acral keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Brünauer-Fuhs-Siemens type of palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, &quot;Keratosis palmoplantaris varians&quot;, &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma areata&quot;, &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma striata&quot;, &quot;Wachter keratoderma&quot;, and &quot;Wachters palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;) is a cutaneous condition, an autosomal dominant keratoderma principally involving the soles with onset in infancy or the first few years of life.
** Type 1: : DSG1
** Type 2: : DSP
** Type 3: : KRT1
* &quot;Carvajal syndrome&quot; (also known as &quot;Striate palmoplantar keratoderma with woolly hair and cardiomyopathy&quot; and &quot;Striate palmoplantar keratoderma with woolly hair and left ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;,) is a cutaneous condition inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and due to a defect in desmoplakin. Striate palmoplantar keratoderma, woolly hair, and left ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy has been described in both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms, but only the recessive forms have a clear association with dilated cardiomyopathy. The skin disease presents as a striate palmoplantar keratoderma with some nonvolar involvement, particularly at sites of pressure or abrasion.
* &quot;Scleroatrophic syndrome of Huriez&quot; (also known as &quot;Huriez syndrome&quot;, &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma with scleroatrophy&quot;, &quot;Palmoplantar keratoderma with sclerodactyly&quot;, &quot;Scleroatrophic and keratotic dermatosis of the limbs&quot;, and &quot;Sclerotylosis&quot;) is an autosomal dominant keratoderma with sclerodactyly present at birth with a diffuse symmetric keratoderma of the palms and soles. An association with 4q23 has been described. It was characterized in 1968.
* &quot;Vohwinkel syndrome&quot; (also known as &quot;Keratoderma hereditaria mutilans&quot;, &quot;Keratoma hereditaria mutilans&quot;, &quot;Mutilating keratoderma of Vohwinkel&quot;, &quot;Mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;) is a diffuse autosomal dominant keratoderma with onset in early infancy characterized by a honeycombed keratoderma involving the palmoplantar surfaces. Mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss is often associated. It has been associated with GJB2. It was characterized in 1929.
* &quot;Olmsted syndrome&quot; (also known as &quot;Mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma with periorificial keratotic plaques&quot;, &quot;Mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma with periorificial plaques&quot; and &quot;Polykeratosis of Touraine&quot;) is a keratoderma of the palms and soles, with flexion deformity of the digits, that begins in infancy. Treatment with retinoids has been described. It has been associated with mutations in TRPV3.
* &quot;Aquagenic keratoderma&quot;, also known as &quot;acquired aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma&quot;, &quot;transient reactive papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma&quot;, &quot;aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma&quot;, and &quot;aquagenic wrinkling of the palms&quot;, is a skin condition characterized by the development of white papules on the palms after water exposure. The condition causes irritation of the palms when touching certain materials after being wet, e.g., paper, cloth. An association with cystic fibrosis has been suggested. The association with cystic fibrosis suggests an increased salt content in the skin.

== Genetics ==
Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma has been associated with keratin 9 and keratin 16.

Nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma has been associated with keratin 1 and keratin 16.

<text>The Māhāmastakābhiṣeka (&quot;Grand Consecration&quot;) refers to the &quot;abhiṣeka&quot; (anointment) of the Jain idols when held on a large scale. The most famous of such consecrations is the anointment of the Bahubali Gommateshwara statue located at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka, India. It is an important Jain festival held once every 12 years. It is an integral part of the ancient and composite Jain tradition.

The festival is held in veneration of a high monolithic statue of the Siddha Bahubali. The anointing last took place in February 2018, and the next ceremony will take place in 2030. The ceremony in 2018 is said to be the 88th in the series that commenced in the year 981 AD and was the second Mahamastakabhisheka of the 21st century. The ceremony is expected to be graced by numerous Jain ascetics. The February 2018 event was held under the leadership of Charukeerthi Bhattaraka Swamiji of Shravanabelagola from 17 to 25 February 2018.

== Anointment of the Gommateshwara Bahubali image ==
Bahubali, the son of Rishabhanatha, the first of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras, is worshipped for living with exceptional qualities that he displayed during all stages of his life from conception, birth, renunciation, enlightenment and salvation. This 58.8 feet tall statue is the most magnificent among all Jain works of art. It was built in circa 983. The Bahubali statue is described as one of the mightiest achievements of ancient Karnataka in the realm of sculptural art. The statue stands upright in the posture of meditation known as kayotsarga, reaching a height of nearly 57 feet atop the Vindhyagiri - accessible through a flight of 700 steps.

===Procedure===
Purified water and sandalwood paste is poured over the statue from a scaffolding. This event continues for weeks. As the &quot;Mahamastakabhisheka&quot; begins, consecrated water is sprinkled onto the participants by devotees carrying 1,008 specially prepared vessels (kalashas). The statue is then bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion. Offerings are made of petals, gold and silver coins, and precious stones. Most recently, the ceremony&#x27;s finale has included an enormous shower of flowers from a waiting helicopter.

<text>This is a list of characters from the TV [[sitcom]] &quot;[[Red Dwarf]]&quot;.

==Major characters==

===Overview===


===Details===

==Alter egos==
===Ace Rimmer===

Arnold &quot;Ace&quot; Rimmer is an alter-ego of Arnold Rimmer, also played by Chris Barrie. Ace first appears in the episode &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; (S4,E5) and is the antithesis of Rimmer. He is modest despite being a popular, knowledgeable, charming, daredevil hero. He comes from a seemingly perfect universe, in which Rimmer and Lister lived happy, successful lives and were good friends.

Ace&#x27;s childhood paralleled Rimmer&#x27;s up until the age of seven, when one of them was kept down a year at school while the other was not. The one kept down became Ace, who claimed that the shame of being a clear foot taller than his classmates inspired him to buckle down, fight back, and work hard, while Arnold spent the rest of his life making excuses for his many failures.

Ace travels from planet to planet wearing a gold, fur-lined flight suit and saving people&#x27;s lives. He was originally a test pilot for the Space Corps in his own universe, which also features an alter ego of Lister (nicknamed &#x27;Spanners&#x27; by Ace) who is a flight engineer married to Kochanski and has twin sons, Jim and Bexley (the exact family to which the regular Lister always aspired). Ace&#x27;s other friends included the Space Corps chaplain (played by The Cat actor Danny John-Jules), a receptionist named Mellie (played by Holly actress Hattie Hayridge), and Admiral Sir James Tranter, a superior officer whom Ace nicknames &#x27;Bongo&#x27; (played by Kryten actor Robert Llewellyn). Despite being a happily married heterosexual, Bongo has a crush on Ace, who takes it in stride despite not reciprocating his feelings. Unlike Rimmer who desperately wanted to be an officer but turned out to be a vending machine attendant - Ace is a commander, but is always modest about the attention he receives. He spends time with Spanners, the engineering crew, and the enlisted men/ratings. He even refused to attend a lavish party his fellow officers threw for him, instead planning to go to a smaller one with Spanners and the enlisted.

Ace was offered the chance to pilot a brand-new spacecraft, one that can cross dimensions - leading to him meeting the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crew. Rimmer was instantly bitter that Ace was everything he dreamed of becoming himself. Ace had hoped that Rimmer was like him, but later regarded him as a &quot;weasly maggot&quot;. In contrast, Ace and Lister became firm friends, prompting a lot of snide remarks from Rimmer about their &#x27;relationship.&#x27;

Following his visit to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Ace extended his adventures through the multi-verse and meeting many alternative versions of himself. When he finally became unable to carry on (&quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot;-S7,E2), he passed his legacy on to another version of himself, who became a new Ace. In turn, when it was the new Ace&#x27;s time, he passed the torch on. As each Ace died, their light bees were sent in orbit in small yellow &#x27;coffins&#x27; around an unknown planet, and by the time &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;&#x27;s Rimmer took on the mantle in &quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot;, the billions of Ace Rimmers who came before him had formed a golden ring similar to Saturn&#x27;s (and resembling the logo of the TV series).

Ace&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;Smoke me a kipper, I&#x27;ll be back for breakfast!&quot;, and a running gag in the series is that everyone who encounters Ace exclaims &quot;What a guy!&quot; in adoration, once even in German: &quot;Was für ein Kerl!&quot;

After encountering a polymorph in &quot;&quot; (S6,E4), the original hologram Rimmer is robbed of his emotional bitterness, and as result takes on a personality identical to Ace. The now brave and heroic Rimmer saves the lives of the crew when the Emohawk turns into a grenade, but must reluctantly return to his cowardly ways upon defeating the creature.

===Duane Dibbley===

Duane Dibbley is the y alter-ego of the Cat, played by Danny John-Jules with a bowl haircut and a large overbite. He first appears in the Series V episode &quot;Back To Reality (S5,E6),&quot; as part of a hallucinogenic experience, designed to cause despair in the Dwarfers. He then returns in &quot;,&quot; caused by a polymorph absorbing the Cat&#x27;s cool (Rimmer described him as &quot;looking so geeky, he couldn&#x27;t even get into a science fiction convention&quot;, Ace later being unable to even mercy-kill Duane in order to defeat the Emohawk as he was so pathetic it would be like killing Bambi). In the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Red Dwarf Night&quot; he appears in the &quot;Can&#x27;t Cook, Won&#x27;t Cook&quot; parody (&quot;Can&#x27;t Smeg Won&#x27;t Smeg&quot;) after The Cat refuses to take part in the show on the same team as Rimmer.

In Series VIII episode &quot;Back in the Red,&quot;(S8,E1-3) the Cat, Lister, Kochanski, and Kryten disguised themselves as &quot;The Dibbley Family&quot; by wearing mop heads on their heads and large false teeth.

Duane has the opposite personality to the cat - he is a lot more nervous and shy than the Cat. He is very clumsy lacking the Cat&#x27;s grace, he also treats others with more respect. Not having the Cat&#x27;s ego he referred to Rimmer as &#x27;sir&#x27; , something the real Cat would not do.
Duane appears to possess a great deal of self hatred as he is aware of his differences and often states that he hates Duane Dibbley.

The character&#x27;s brief appearances have proved incredibly popular. John-Jules&#x27; explanation for this was &quot;No-one&#x27;s ever written a black nerd before.&quot;

===Arlene Rimmer, Deb Lister, The Dog and Hilly===
Played by Suzanne Bertish, Angela Bruce, Matthew Devitt and Hattie Hayridge.
They are alternative versions of Arnold Rimmer, Dave Lister, The Cat and Holly from a parallel universe in the episode &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; (1988). With the exception of the Dog, the others are female versions of the regular characters. Dog has dog-like traits—for example a hatred of bathing. The Cat takes an instant dislike to him, but the Dog does not pick up on this and continues to mistake Cat for another dog.

===Queeg 500===

Queeg 500 (S2,E5) is a &quot;back-up&quot; computer AI system with an IQ of 500, played by Charles Augins. Queeg claims that Holly&#x27;s IQ is not 6,000 but 6 and that Holly gets his information from a children&#x27;s science book, called the &quot;Junior Colour Encyclopaedia of Space&quot;. He demotes Holly to night-watchman and takes over the ship.

Queeg soon makes the crew&#x27;s lives hell. Rimmer is forced to take regular long-distance runs whilst Cat and Lister are made to work for tiny amounts of food. They appeal to Holly who challenges Queeg to a game of chess, with the loser being deleted. Holly loses the game and fades from view. He then returns and announces that he was Queeg all the time. The whole thing was a practical joke to teach the crew to appreciate Holly even though he has gone a bit &quot;computer &quot;.

&quot;Queeg&quot; is a reference to Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg, USN, a fictional character in Herman Wouk&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and 1954 film of the same name. Both Queeg and Queeg 500 are in command of a vessel and prone to eccentric behaviour. Both display an oppressive command style and are prone to unprovoked angry outbursts.

==Shipboard robots==
===The Skutters===

The skutters are motorized service and maintenance robots that stand at around tall, appearing as motorized boxes with a single limb each, ending in a three-clawed hand with an electronic eye. They perform menial tasks around the ship, such as sweeping the cinema floors after a movie, or painting the corridor walls. The skutters are unable to speak (except with bleeping noises), but can usually make their feelings clear. Their hands are particularly well designed for giving &quot;flipping the bird&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;up yours&quot;) gestures with one or two digits, most often to Rimmer. Their behavior is rather more human-like than might be expected for such crudely designed robots; they play cowboys-and-Indians, enjoy watching films, are highly emotional and appear to be somewhat unstable and malfunctional, presumably as a result of 3 million years of continuous operation.

The tiny, motorized, three-clawed service droids were actual working models, save the episode &quot;The End&quot; (S1,E1), where the skutters were a post-production addition to the chicken soup nozzle scene. They were made up of various parts including old shoe boxes and the engines of radio controlled cars. Interference originating from the radios of a nearby taxicab company, which was particularly busy during filming of the episode &quot;Future Echoes&quot; (S1,E2), caused havoc with the skutter models on set. One reportedly poked Craig Charles in the eye, and another launched an attack on Chris Barrie&#x27;s groin. Coincidentally, the skutters had been scripted as very inept towards their maintenance work and mischievous towards humans.

Kryten referred to a skutter by the name Bob in the episode &quot;The Last Day&quot; (S3,E6). Series VIII also featured a skutter named Bob along with his &quot;wife&quot; Madge. The skutters are fans of John Wayne, having their broom cupboard filled with Western props and pin-ups of Wayne, and are members of the John Wayne Fan Club.

Two skutters appeared in the US pilot playing poker until one of them gives Rimmer what looks like &quot;the finger&quot;. These skutters were given a revamp in design: a wider, rounded body with a complex neck and a narrow head with concealed eyes that pop up.

The skutters are unusually capable of sex, as in the episode Parallel Universe, a &quot;male&quot; Skutter and its &quot;female&quot; equivalent from the parallel universe are seen with &quot;children&quot;.

In &quot;Back To Earth&quot;(S9,E1-3), the skutters had been given a complete redesign, and were added in post as a CG effect rather than being a remote controlled mechanism, as there wasn&#x27;t enough money in the budget to even revamp the casing. Due to this, as the actors had no visual cue, Danny John-Jules was required to step in as a replacement for a skutter so that Chris Barrie had something to react to.

===Talkie Toaster===
Talkie Toaster is a minor character, a monomaniacal talking toaster that tries to steer every conversation to the subject of toast.

Owned by Lister, Talkie Toaster is a toaster with artificial intelligence that is completely obsessed with making toast and annoys everyone on board. In Series I (and a deleted scene in Series II), it appears as a standard 1970s-style toaster made from stainless steel but with a circular light on the side which flashes as he speaks, and is voiced by John Lenahan, with a transatlantic accent. In Series IV, it appears as a red toaster made of plastic, with its name &quot;Talkie Toaster&quot; emblazoned on the side, and rather more flashing red and green lights and is voiced by David Ross (who played Kryten in his title episode).

The Toaster repeatedly interjects in conversations and whenever possible tries to steer the conversation towards toast. Eventually Lister smashes the Toaster with a hammer. Kryten repairs the toaster in order to use it as a guinea-pig for &quot;intelligence compression&quot; — restoring Holly&#x27;s former intelligence (the ultimate aim is to cure Holly&#x27;s computer senility) at the cost of reducing her operational lifespan. The toaster&#x27;s repaired personality is somewhat different from the original: it now has a different voice and no longer tries to hide its obsession with toast.

The Talkie Toaster returns in the Series XII episode &quot;Mechocracy&quot; (2017), where it is again voiced by David Ross and depicted in its Series IV appearance. In the episode, the toaster has spent nearly two decades switched off in the garbage hold. Kryten and Lister make a deal with the toaster to swing the election for president of the machines on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in Kryten&#x27;s favour. After Kryten wins, the Cat locks Rimmer in the garbage hold alone with the toaster until Monday.

Outside the TV series, Talkie Toaster plays a secondary, yet vital role in the book &quot;Better Than Life&quot;, where Holly revives him in order to have someone to talk to while the crew are stuck in the virtual reality game. In this version, it is toaster who figures out how to restore Holly&#x27;s IQ after perusing Holly&#x27;s manuals, and later is also the one who informs the Dwarfers how to survive a black hole, Holly having given him this information while showing off his intelligence before he had to shut himself down (although he &#x27;required&#x27; the crew to eat multiple pieces of toast before he gave them the information, Kryten having to eat Rimmer&#x27;s share).

Talkie Toaster&#x27;s interviews with various &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; characters (complete with offers of toast) can be found on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;&#x27;s official website.

===The Chocolate Dispenser===
The Chocolate Dispenser (voiced by Tony Slattery) has its only appearance in the Series VIII episode &quot;Only the Good...&quot;. Having been stolen from by Rimmer, it sets off an alarm to alert the Captain of chocolate being stolen (&quot;&quot;Alert, alert! A choccie nut bar has been removed without payment!&quot;)&quot; It later goes on to inform Rimmer concerning his becoming its &#x27;nemesis.&#x27; His appearance in the last scene involved it telling Rimmer that the formula which he got from the parallel universe, which would stop the virus that was destroying the ship, had in fact become the formula for the virus again; then firing a drink can at Rimmer&#x27;s head with its final lines, &quot;Every dog has its day, and this is the day, and I&#x27;m the dog!&quot; and Rimmer is knocked unconscious.

In the alternative ending, the virus&#x27; antidote in the other world became the virus and the virus in that world became the antidote and then, the ship was saved from destruction, they were no longer in the Tank and later, Rimmer finally pays the money he owes the dispenser, but it still fires a can at Rimmer&#x27;s head, knocking him unconscious anyway as Rimmer says, &quot;Every dog has its day...&quot;, and after he is knocked unconscious, the Chocolate Dispenser finishes with, &quot;...and this is the day, and I&#x27;m the dog!&quot; and he howls as the audience applauds.

===The Revolving Toilet===

The Revolving Toilet is an artificially intelligent toilet which is located on a revolving plinth behind the washbasin in Lister&#x27;s bedroom. It speaks in a dull male voice and bears a sign which reads &quot;Now irradiate your hands.&quot;

The Revolving Toilet appeared in &quot;Balance of Power&quot;, in which it appeared to Lister when he dismissively responded &quot;Oh crap&quot; to Holly&#x27;s statement that he thought Rimmer was the best person to bring back as hologram because he would keep Lister sane. When Lister says he didn&#x27;t want the toilet, the Revolving Toilet apologizes and says that it wasn&#x27;t paying attention.

==Other &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; crew==
===Captain Frank Hollister===
Captain Frank Hollister is played by American actor, Mac McDonald, in the television series.

Hollister is the captain of the interplanetary mining vessel, the &quot;Red Dwarf.&quot; He is seen in the first episode, in which he sentences Dave Lister to eighteen months in stasis for bringing his unquarantined cat on board. When Lister is released, Hollister, along with the rest of the crew, have been dead dust for three million years.

In Series VIII, with the crew resurrected by nanobots, Hollister becomes a main character. This is also the series where it is revealed that the captain is in fact &quot;Dennis the Donut Boy&quot; and that he had abused confidential files in order to work his way up the ranks and become captain.

Captain Hollister briefly returns in the Series XII episode, &quot;Skipper&quot; (2017), where Rimmer uses a quantum skipper to travel to a universe shortly before the crew of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; is killed by a radiation leak. Rimmer finds Hollister attempting to use the escape pod, which jams as the radiation leak reaches him. 

In the first &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; novel, the captain is a woman named &quot;Kirk&quot; and in the pilot for the unaired American version of the show the captain is a woman named &quot;Tau&quot;.

Hollister&#x27;s characterization is inconsistent. Before the accident, he was a fair, just, responsible leader. After resurrection, he becomes indulgent and corrupt. He&#x27;s also depicted as indulgent and corrupt in the Series XII episode, &quot;Skipper&quot; (2017), where Rimmer finds Hollister attempting to use the escape pod, when Rimmer is using Kryten&#x27;s new &quot;Quantum Skipper&quot; to travel to other universes, this one set shortly before the crew of Red Dwarf is killed by a radiation leak.

===Olaf Petersen===
Olaf Petersen is played by Mark Williams in the television series. He is a Danish catering officer on the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; mining vessel.

First appearing in the pilot episode, Petersen is the best friend of Dave Lister. He, Lister, Selby and Chen spend most of their free time getting drunk. Like the rest of the crew, Petersen is killed in the radiation leak. His remains are found in the Drive Room as a white powder that Lister tasted. He appears in two other episodes in the first two series. Petersen is resurrected along with the rest of the crew in Series VIII, but is not seen, although often referred to.

===Selby and Chen===
Selby and Chen are played by David Gillespie and Paul Bradley, respectively. Chen works in the ship&#x27;s kitchens and both spend their time drunk. First appearing in the pilot episode, they spend most of their free time with Lister and Petersen getting drunk. Like the rest of the crew they are killed in the radiation leak. When the crew are resurrected in Series VIII, Selby and Chen are the first crew members the regular characters encountered. They have not been seen again.

===George McIntyre===
George McIntyre was a minor character aboard &quot;Red Dwarf.&quot;

In the novel &quot;Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers,&quot; McIntyre was an officer on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; who was severely depressed due to growing debt problems. After a horrifying experience in the hands of gangsters (he returned to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; carrying his nose in a Titan Hilton Hotel napkin), McIntyre committed suicide. He was brought back as a hologram and replaced the ship&#x27;s first hologram, Frank Saunders (much to Saunders&#x27; relief). Captain Hollister notes in his personal log that McIntyre was not especially crucial to the success of the mission, but was brought back anyway because Hollister was curious to hear his resurrection speech.

According to the original script of The End, McIntyre was killed by a minor radiation leak from the drive plate that Rimmer failed to repair.

In the television series, McIntyre was only seen at his &quot;Welcome Back Reception&quot; thanking everyone for flowers and turning up at his funeral, and his choice of music at the funeral was &quot;See You Later Alligator&quot; (in certain broadcasts this song was replaced with football anthem &quot;Here We Go&quot;) as his ashes were blasted into space. George was portrayed by Robert McCulley. He was switched off during the radioactive disaster, for Arnold Rimmer to replace him afterwards by Holly to keep Dave Lister sane. The cause of his death isn&#x27;t mentioned in the TV series.

===Frank Todhunter===
Frank Todhunter appeared in the first episode only and was played by Robert Bathurst. A well spoken officer, he tries to placate the tension between Rimmer and Lister (before siding with Lister against Rimmer; &quot;Oh, Rimmer, you &quot;are&quot; a smeghead&quot;), and attempts to describe how the stasis booth works to the latter. He is also an exam invigilator causing him to be someone that Rimmer severely dislikes. As part of Kristine Kochanski&#x27;s story to ease Lister&#x27;s claustrophobia, she claims the Todhunter from her dimension is gay, despite being a married man and notorious womanizer.

===Yvonne McGruder===
According to &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;, Yvonne McGruder was the ship&#x27;s female boxing champion, and the only woman Rimmer ever had sex with while he was alive. She is mentioned in a number of episodes, but her only on-screen appearance is inside a simulation in &quot;Better Than Life&quot;, where she is played by Judy Hawkins.

===Prison Governor Ackerman===
Prison Governor &quot;Nicey&quot; Ackerman is played by Graham McTavish.

Seen only in the eighth series, Mr Ackerman is a stereotypically sadistic prison governor, enjoying his power over the inmates in Floor 13 (&quot;Red Dwarf&quot;&#x27;s brig), &quot;The Tank.&quot; He has a glass eye, which at one point is stolen from him. Prone to overreaction, he is a victim of pranks from the inmates on more than one occasion. After having sodium pentothal put into his inhaler as a prank, he shows up late at a meeting with the captain and reveals that he was sorry, but he was busy having &quot;jiggy jiggy&quot; with the Science Officer&#x27;s wife, and needed time to change out of his Batman costume. Following the prank Lister suggested that a Tarzan costume would be better, since it would take less time to change out of.

According to various interviews on the Red Dwarf website, Ackerman was originally part of the same prison ship that was transporting the simulant encountered in the episode &quot;Justice,&quot; but escaped from the ship after accidentally enabling the simulants to get free.

===Warden Knot===
Warden Knot is played by Shend.

Like governor Ackerman, Knot is a fairly sadistic warden. He dies in the episode &quot;Cassandra&quot; when Cassandra predicts that Arnold Rimmer will die of a heart attack. To evade death Rimmer pretends that Knot is called &quot;Arnold Rimmer&quot; and Knot, as according to prophecy, has a heart attack after learning he is going to die.

===Kill Crazy===
Kill Crazy is a minor character played by Jake Wood, appearing only in Series 8.

Kill Crazy (real name: Oswald Blenkinsop) is a psychopathic inmate who is obsessed with killing things. He is not very bright, thinking that he could fight a Tyrannosaurus Rex using his fists. His fighting buddy is Baxter (played by comedian Ricky Grover). When the prisoners arrive at the destination of a mission, Kill Crazy screams &quot;LET&#x27;S GO KILL SOMETHING!&quot; before charging forward at great pace and knocking himself unconscious on a low doorway.

===Katerina Bartikovsky===

Katerina Bartikovsky is played by Sophie Winkleman.

In a hallucination induced by the ink of a despair squid, the crew encounters Katerina Bartikovsky. In this hallucination, Katerina was the science officer of the Red Dwarf before the accident. She is of Russian heritage and speaks with a strong accent. Her personality is strict, serious, and judgmental, with a certain amount of scientific genius and arrogance. She suddenly appears as a hard-light hologram in &quot;Back to Earth, Part One&quot; after Rimmer&#x27;s negligence nearly results in the death of his crewmates. She uses her superior rank to make herself ship&#x27;s hologram and tries to have Rimmer deactivated and destroyed; it is also evident that she has personal disdain for him. Meanwhile, she attempts to bring Lister home with a device she made with a mining laser and the DNA of a dimension-hopping squid (the hallucination&#x27;s explanation for the despair squid), which the rest of the crew enters through to get back to Earth, which allows Rimmer to escape deletion. She later encounters Rimmer in a street on Earth, claiming to have gone through a second portal, where they discuss the morals of deleting holograms. Katerina argues that since holograms are simulated dead humans, then killing them is acceptable. Using this logic, Rimmer pushes her into traffic, whisking her away. She is not seen again after this incident.

==Miscellaneous characters==
===The Cat Priest===
The Cat Priest was, until The Promised Land, the only member of the species &quot;Felis sapiens&quot; seen on the television show &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; apart from The Cat. He was played by Noel Coleman. One of his hands is depicted with a different skin tone compared to the rest of his body, possibly implying that the Cat race possessed numerous variations in their skin colours (similar to how modern cats have different fur colours). 

The Cat Priest was blind. He was the Cat&#x27;s teacher and guardian after his parents died, but Cat was never really interested and preferred to go off investigating. The Cat Priest was once a devout follower of the Cat religion, but over time as the Cat race fled Red Dwarf and those who stayed aboard died he lost his faith (&quot;Waiting for God&quot;-S1,E4).

When the Cat Priest was dying, Lister appeared and revealed that he was the Cat god Cloister. The Priest apologized for losing his faith, saying &quot;You tested me, and I failed you.&quot; Lister assured him that he had not failed, and he would get into Fuchal. The Cat Priest&#x27;s last words before he died of a heart attack were &quot;This is the happiest day of my ...&quot;

In the remastered version of the episode in which he appeared, the Cat Priest&#x27;s body was cremated and the ashes jettisoned into space.

===Mr. Flibble===
Mr. Flibble is a hologramatical hand-puppet penguin. He is fluffy and malevolent, and often &quot;very cross.&quot; In the episode &quot;Quarantine (S5,E4),&quot; Arnold Rimmer wore Mr. Flibble on his hand and together they terrorized the rest of the crew. Rimmer had been infected by a hologramatical virus, the &quot;&quot;Hex virus&quot;,&quot; which gave him mental powers, but also made him completely psychotic. Both Mr. Flibble and Rimmer were armed with the power of Hex vision. When they attack with this power, their eyes glow red, and then a deadly beam of energy is discharged from their eyes.

Although he only appears in one episode and had no audible lines, Mr. Flibble became a fan favourite, and is now an interviewer on the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; official website.

===Hudzen-10===
Hudzen-10 appeared only in the Series III episode &quot;The Last Day&quot; (S3,E6), and was portrayed by Gordon Kennedy. A replacement for Kryten, Hudzen-10 followed Red Dwarf for many years, eventually being driven insane. After the Red Dwarf crew told him to leave the ship, he deemed them all to be members of non-human species (bar Lister, whom he designated &#x27;What the Hell!&#x27;, concluding that he was &#x27;Barely Human&#x27;), and attempted to kill them all. He was only stopped when Kryten told him that &#x27;Silicon Heaven&#x27; did not exist, forcing him into an existential dilemma.

===Rimmer&#x27;s Dad===
In &quot;Future Echoes&quot; (1988), Rimmer implies that his father had committed suicide when he mentions that he had given advice about how you can cope with anything with a short haircut &quot;just before that rather unfortunate suicide business&quot;. However, according to a letter from Rimmer&#x27;s mum &quot;Better Than Life&quot; (1988), Rimmer&#x27;s dad had died peacefully in his sleep (or possibly in his jeep), and Rimmer appeared to have been unaware of this prior to the fact. In &quot;Better Than Life&quot;, Rimmer mentions that his father was unsuccessful in his attempts to join the Space Corps and consequently became obsessed with ensuring his sons would (he stretched them on a traction machine to make them tall enough and withheld dinner unless they could answer questions on astronavigation correctly). He admits to Lister that he loathed the man and his dearest wish is to one day hear his father say that he is proud of Rimmer. He is portrayed in the episode by John Abineri, when, while playing the &quot;Better Than Life&quot; game, Rimmer encounters a simulation of his father who still doesn&#x27;t show any pride in his son, instead calling Rimmer a smeghead, to which the Cat claims is his fantasy in the game.

He next appears in &quot;The Beginning&quot; (2012), played by Simon Treves. It is shown that Rimmer&#x27;s father was also a teacher at Rimmer&#x27;s school and used him as a guinea pig in an experiment about peer pressure (Rimmer&#x27;s father instructed the other students to give incorrect answers). Rimmer is shown to have a hololamp containing a message from his father that was to be played when Rimmer achieved his dream of becoming an officer – when stuck for a plan when called upon to mastermind the salvation of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; from Simulants, Rimmer decided to take the Cat&#x27;s advice and play the message anyway to escape his father&#x27;s memory. The message shockingly revealed that Rimmer was actually the son of the family&#x27;s gardener. This does not affect Rimmer badly (as the rest of the crew had worried it would), instead liberating him from his lifelong fear of letting his ancestors down and allowing him to come up with a plan to save the day.

===Rimmer&#x27;s Mum===
Rimmer&#x27;s mother, played by Kalli Greenwood, is referred to several times in the series, not altogether consistently. In &quot;Polymorph&quot; (S3,E3), Rimmer describes her affectionately as &quot;prim and proper&quot;, almost austere but with no time for fools. Yet in &quot;The Last Day&quot; (S3,E6), he indicates that she was overly sexually promiscuous. In &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; she is briefly shown as a mother who is concerned for her son&#x27;s upbringing and education but is insensitive to his feelings (for example, lecturing him about his situation at school while he is hanging upside down as the result of a mean prank by his brothers, rather than help him down first).

In the episode &quot;Polymorph&quot;, the Polymorph makes Rimmer angry so it can suck out his anger; to do this it changes into Rimmer&#x27;s mum and has sexual intercourse with Lister, who has lost his sense of fear. Holly repeatedly stresses to Rimmer that this is all a ploy to anger him, so he manages to keep his cool until the Polymorph taunts him, saying &quot;The things this boy can do with Alphabetti Spaghetti...&quot;

She is briefly mentioned in the episode &quot;Terrorform&quot; (S5,E3) when Lister, Cat and Kryten hunt for Rimmer in the &#x27;Swamp of Despair&#x27; (they find a bloodsucking leech with her face, a physical embodiment of how Rimmer perceives her).

===Howard Rimmer===
One of Arnold&#x27;s often mentioned brothers. Howard Rimmer (Mark Dexter) appeared in the Series 10 episode &quot;Trojan&quot; (S10,E1). Howard is a crew member aboard a ship that makes contact with the Red Dwarf crew. Howard&#x27;s hologrammatic status suggest that he, like Arnold, died in active service and was resurrected. Originally described by Arnold as a great man, we discover that Howard is very similar in character to Arnold himself—opening the possibility that he also was fathered by the Rimmer family&#x27;s gardener.

===Frank Rimmer===
Frank Rimmer (Chris Barrie in a dual role) is another of Arnold&#x27;s brothers. Frank appeared in the episode &quot;Timeslides&quot; (S3,E5) when Kryten accidentally mutates one of Frank&#x27;s wedding pictures, allowing Lister to walk into it. Frank is extremely annoyed at Lister for blocking the shot and hits him several times before Lister disappears back into the present. In the episode, Frank appears to be wearing a Space Corps full-dress uniform.

&quot;Frank&quot; is also the name of his paternal uncle, his namesake, who is the father of two daughters, Sarah and Alice, is revealed to have been having an affair with his sister-in-law, and who inadvertently gave his nephew, Arnold, his first french kiss (after having mistaken him for Rimmer&#x27;s mother in a dark room on a vacation).

==Guest stars==
Many co-stars of the first few episodes have gone on to careers away from &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, such as Robert Bathurst, Tony Hawks, Paul Bradley, Craig Ferguson and Mark Williams. But later series have attracted established stars, some of whom were fans of the show.

<text>Sordaria fimicola is a species of microscopic fungus. It is commonly found in the feces of herbivores. &quot;Sordaria fimicola&quot; is often used in introductory biology and mycology labs because it is easy to grow on nutrient agar in dish cultures. The genus &quot;Sordaria&quot;, closely related to &quot;Neurospora&quot; and &quot;Podospora&quot;, is a member of the large class Sordariomycetes, or flask-fungi. The natural habitat of the three species of &quot;Sordaria&quot; that have been the principal subjects in genetic studies is dung of herbivorous animals. The species &quot;S. fimicola&quot; is common and worldwide in distribution. The species of &quot;Sordaria&quot; are similar morphologically, producing black perithecia containing asci with eight dark ascospores in a linear arrangement. These species share a number of characteristics that are advantageous for genetic studies. They all have a short life cycle, usually 7–12 days, and are easily grown in culture. Most species are self-fertile and each strain is isogenic. All kinds of mutants are easily induced and readily obtainable with particular ascospore color mutants. These visual mutants aid in tetrad analysis, especially in analysis of intragenic recombination.

The most common form of &quot;S. fimicola&quot; is a dark brown. Certain mutants are grey or tan. A common experiment for an introductory biology lab class is to cross one of the mutant types with a wild type and observe the ratio of coloring in the offspring. This experiment illustrates the concepts of genetic inheritance in a haploid organism. The eight ascospores are produced inside an ascus. &quot;Sordaria&quot; squashes can give us information about crossing over during meiosis. If no crossing over occurs a 4:4 pattern is produced: four black spores, and four tan spores all lined up. If crossing over does occur there is a 2:2:2:2 pattern visible, or a 2:4:2 pattern.

Another common lab use is to observe meiosis and mitosis in the fruit bodies, called perithecia. An interesting feature of &quot;S. fimicola&quot; is that its fruit body is phototrophic. Thus, as it grows the stalk will bend toward a light source and when the sac bursts, the spores are shot towards the light.

==Taxonomy==

Research to update Sordariomycete fungal taxonomy is ongoing, and the position of &quot;Sordaria fimicola&quot; within the taxonomy of the Sordariomycetes is being researched and updated. The sordariomycetes are known as the flask fungi because they are characterized by flask-shaped perithecia and unitunicate asci. Phylogenetic studies of partial 18s ribosomal DNA strands has illuminated the phylogeny of the Sordariomycetes. Morphological features that characterize the Sordariaceae include the differentiation of the hyphal envelope that surrounds the ascogonium into peripheral wall layers and a pseudoparenchymatous centrum. Broad paraphyses composed of delicate, multinucleate cells arise from the cells of the centrum and completely fill the perithecium, crushing the remaining pseudoparenchymatous cells against the perithecial wall. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; differs from other species of Sordariaceae studied in the aggregation of the ascogenous cells to form a placenta‐like mass in the base of the centrum. Consequently, the asci arise in a cluster rather than in a uniform wall layer.

==Fungal morphology==
&quot;Sordaria fimicola&quot; is an ascomycete fungus that grows well on nutrient agar, dung, and in decaying matter in soil. As an ascoymcete it has a sexual teleomorph form and an asexual anamorph form. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; typically follows the life cycle of an obligate dung fungus; sexual reproduction that is obligate to herbivore dung after passage through the herbivore&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract. Following meiosis on dung, ascospores are discharged and stick onto plant surfaces where they are thought to remain epiphyllous. S. fimicola grows septate hyphae which at the macro level look like small dark brown fibers forming a fluffy sheet over the substrate. Small black spots will form when sexual reproduction occurs, as these spots are the location of the ascii. Additionally, there are tan and grey mutant strains of &quot;S. fimicola&quot;. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; grows best in carbon rich substrates, but it also needs access to nitrogen. Research has shown that &quot;S. fimicola&quot; grows best with a carbon:nitrogen ratio between 5:1 and 10:1, as &quot;S. fimicola&quot; grown under these conditions produces markedly more perithecium than in those with higher carbon ratios or higher nitrogen ratios. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; grows well in a laboratory setting and because of that it is often used in introductory biology laboratories and also as a model organism for research. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; is also a good tool for teaching meiosis as it quickly produces diploid perithecium which undergoes meiosis to produce ascii with ordered linear tetrads of haploid ascospores.

==Ecology==

Although &quot;S. fimicola&quot; was traditionally understood to grow on the dung of herbivorous animals or in decaying plant matter, it has also been discovered that it grows symbiotically with some plants. New research shows that &quot;S. fimicola&quot; is a facultative dung fungus and &quot;S. fimicola&quot; has been found to grow among the roots of rye-grass and wheat-grass. In sterilized and unsterilized soil, &quot;S. fimicola&quot; promoted host growth and prevented mortality. Research shows that &quot;S. fimicola&quot; in potato dextrose cultures is capable of producing triacontanol and indole-3-carboxaldehyde, both of which have antibacterial properties that may help prevent host disease.

&quot;S. fimicola&quot; has also been shown to inhibit the growth of other species of fungi which are pathogenic to plants including &quot;Pestalotiopsis guepinii&quot;, &quot;Colletotrichum capsici&quot;, &quot;Curvularia lunata&quot; [&quot;Cochliobolus lunatus&quot;], &quot;Alternaria alternata&quot; and &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;.

&quot;S. fimicola&quot; has also been shown to negatively affect the health of some plants that it can be found growing on. When &quot;S. fimicola&quot; was first isolated from maize researchers believed that it was most likely an opportunistic pathogen. Healthy maize plants in the laboratory did not grow &quot;S. fimicola&quot; indicating that healthy maize plants may exclude it. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; did colonize healthy &quot;B. tectorum&quot; resulting in reduced fecundity and reduced growth.

&quot;S. fimicola&quot; is also phototropic and the response is twofold: 1) the number of fruiting bodies produced by the fungus is influenced by light and 2) the direction which the fruiting bodies grow is also influenced. This response is likely mediated by a specific fungal receptor called the S. fimicola white collar-1 photoreceptor (SfWC-1). Other species of phototropic fungi have homologous receptors with similar receptor domains. &quot;S. fimicola&quot; with a non-functional mutant SfWC-1 receptor had delayed and less-pronounced fruiting-body formation, was defective in phototropism of the perithecial beaks, and lacked the fruiting-body zonation pattern compared with the wild type.

==Gene conversion==

Each individual meiosis generates four haploid products, and after one further round of mitosis, eight products are formed and all retained as haploid spores within the sac-like ascus (pl. asci). The retention of the products of an individual meiosis in an individual ascus has facilitated certain kinds of genetic analyses, particularly the analysis of the molecular mechanism of genetic recombination. When a wild type (+) strain is mated with a mutant (m) strain, ordinarily each ascus will contain a pattern of four + and four m spores. However, it was found that, with low frequency, some asci had ratios that differed from the expected 4+ : 4m (e.g. 6+: 2m or 2+: 6m or even 5+: 3m or 3+: 5m). In these cases it appeared that the m gene had been converted to the + gene or vice versa. And so the phenomenon was termed &quot;gene conversion.&quot; Gene conversion was first detected in &quot;S. fimicola&quot; in 1951 by Lindsay Olive, and definitively characterized by him in 1959. Olive considered that these gene conversion events resulted from &quot;trans replication, by which a locus is copied more than the normal number of times during replication at meiotic prophase.&quot; Since then many studies on the gene conversion phenomenon were carried out with &quot;S. fimicola&quot; and other organisms, particularly other ascomycetes [see review by Whitehouse (1982)]. Efforts to understand gene conversion at the molecular level have provided important insights into the mechanism and adaptive function of meiotic recombination, which in turn bears on the adaptive function of sexual reproduction.

<text>The Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek (; ; Low German: &quot;Bisdom Ösel–Wiek&quot;; contemporary ) was a Roman Catholic diocese and a semi-independent prince-bishopric — part of Terra Mariana (Old Livonia) in the Holy Roman Empire. The bishopric covered what are now Saare, Hiiu, Lääne counties and the western part of Pärnu county of Estonia.

== History ==
The bishopric was created on 1 October 1228 as a Latin rite, and initially possibly exempt, diocese by papal legate William of Modena and simultaneously as a state of Holy Roman Empire—making it a prince-bishopric—by Henry, King of the Romans (1220-1242; not Emperor). Due to the repeated shift of the seat of the bishops, it was also successively known as bishopric of Leal (Lihula) from 1234, Perona (Vana-Pärnu) from 1251, Hapsal (Haapsalu) Castle from 1279, and the seat shifted (alone) to the castle of Arensburg (Kuressaare) on the island of Ösel (Saaremaa); the cathedral and cathedral chapter (canons) remained in Hapsal. It was a suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the Metropolitan Archbishopric of Riga from 1253.

One of the five members of the Livonian Confederation, the state was administratively divided into two bailiwicks (Latin &quot;advocaciae&quot;, German &quot;Vogteien&quot;). The bishop was also the lord of the Teutonic Order over its fiefs on the bishopric&#x27;s territory. From 1241 until 1343, Ösel (Saaremaa) Island was an autonomous part of Ösel-Wiek prince-bishopric (autonomy renewed 27 August 1255).

The principality ceased to exist in 1560 when its last prince-bishop, Johannes V von Münchhausen, sold it to Denmark, which vested executive power in royally appointed Governors (styled Lensmænd to 1654, then Statthalter). King Frederick II of Denmark&#x27;s brother Magnus of Livonia, Duke of Holstein, obtained it as an appanage on 15 April 1560 and was elected bishop on 13 May 1560; the Danish dynasty being Lutheran, he abolished the diocese and assumed the secular feudal style Lord of Ösel (&quot;Stieffte Ozel und Wieck Herr&quot;) on 20 March 1567.

Denmark ceded Wiek (Lääne County) to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in exchange for parts of Ösel belonging to the Livonian Order. Later Ösel became a Danish possession.

<text>The Flying Dutchman is a Dutch planing sailing dinghy that was designed by Uus Van Essen and Conrad Gülcher as a high performance, one design racer and first built in 1951.

The boat was an Olympic sailing class from 1960 until 1992.

==Production==
The boat was built in the past by Sunbeam Yachts, Alpa Yachts, Mader Bootswerft, MacKay Boats, Plastrend/Composite Technologies, Lanaverre, Lockley Newport Boats, Advance Sailboat Corp., Binks Yacht Constructions, Chantier Naval Costantini and Mobjack Manufacturing, starting in 1951. More than 10,000 have been built. In 2022 Mader Bootswerft were still producing the design.

==Design==

The Flying Dutchman is a racing sailboat, initially built of wood, with many modern boats made from fiberglass sandwich construction with a plastic deck. Cold-molded plywood is still used and some sailers prefer that material.

The boat has a fractional sloop rig, a spooned raked stem, a plumb transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard. Modern boats may have plastic rudders and centerboards. It displaces .

The boat has many adjustable settings available while sailing, including the genoa halyard, shroud tension and the mast rake. The crew can use a trapeze to balance the boat.

For sailing downwind the design may be equipped with a symmetrical spinnaker of and in fact was the first design equipped with a spinnaker bow chute.

The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick D-PN of 82.6 and a RYA PN of 879.

==Operational history==
The boat is supported by an active class club that organizes racing events, the &quot;International Flying Dutchman Class Organization&quot;.

The Flying Dutchman was an Olympic sailing class in double-handed dinghies from 1960 until 1992.

Due to its complexity, the design&#x27;s cost has been a barrier to its wider acceptance. 

A &quot;Classic Sailboats&quot; review noted that &quot;the &#x27;fastest double-handed dinghy in the world&#x27; made its Olympic debut in Naples in 1960. It was based on the new go-fast concept of a trapezing crew and a large spinnaker. The ideal crewman should be tall, heavy, nimble and smart – not a simple recipe to follow. The FD has a long waterline and normally planes on the beat. But the large genoa jib makes tacking slow. Pure boatspeed is thus the key ingredient for success.&quot;

The United States Sailing Association describes the boat as &quot;one of the most exhilarating dinghies you will ever be in.&quot;

<doc id="1301261" wikidata="Q3195064" url="?curid=1301261" title="Ken Mehlman">
<text>Kenneth Brian Mehlman (born August 21, 1966) is an American social entrepreneur and businessman. He serves as a member, global head of public affairs, and co-head of KKR global impact at investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. He oversees the firm&#x27;s responsible investment efforts, leading the firm&#x27;s Environmental Social Governance programs. Prior to joining KKR, Mehlman spent a year as an attorney and partner at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. In January 2017, Mehlman announced that he would act as chairman of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Policy Advisory Board.

Mehlman held several national posts in the Republican Party and the George W. Bush administration. In 2000, he was appointed director of the White House Office of Political Affairs. Mehlman managed Bush&#x27;s 2004 re-election campaign, and was 62nd Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, Bush appointed Mehlman to a five-year term on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.

In 2010, Mehlman came out as gay in an interview with journalist Marc Ambinder, which made him one of the few prominent openly gay figures in the Republican Party. He told Ambinder that he was aware that the Republican Party emphasized an anti-gay agenda but felt that he could not &quot;go against the party consensus&quot; when he held leadership positions. After coming out, Mehlman advocated for the recognition of same-sex marriage.

==Early life and education==
Mehlman was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He is one of two sons born to Judith and Arthur Mehlman. His father was director of MuniMae and a former partner at KPMG, for which he was the head of the firm&#x27;s auditing department in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. Mehlman&#x27;s brother, Bruce, works as a lobbyist at Mehlman Consulting.

Mehlman received his undergraduate degree in 1988 from Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he became a member of Phi Kappa Tau&#x27;s Xi chapter. He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1991, where he was a classmate of future President Barack Obama.

==Career==
Mehlman practiced environmental law at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld in Washington, D.C. from 1991 to 1994, when he became legislative director to Representative Lamar S. Smith of Texas&#x27;s 21st congressional district. Mehlman served as Smith&#x27;s legislative director from 1994 to 1996, and then as chief of staff to Representative Kay Granger of Texas&#x27;s 12th congressional district from 1996 to 1999.

Mehlman served as field director for the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. When Bush became president, Mehlman became director of the White House Office of Political Affairs. He managed the Bush re-election campaign in 2004. In January 2005, the American Association of Political Consultants gave Mehlman the &quot;Campaign Manager of the Year&quot; award for his management of the Bush/Cheney presidential ticket.

Mehlman joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co in 2008. As of 2021, he continues to be KKR&#x27;s Global Head of Public Affairs and co-head of KKR Global Impact, helping assess and improve the companies in which KKR invests by engaging stakeholders &amp; leveraging geopolitical &amp; public policy trends. Mehlman also oversees the firm&#x27;s global external affairs, including corporate marketing, regulatory affairs &amp; public policy, and communications. Mehlman leads KKR&#x27;s Environmental Social Governance (ESG) programs for the firm and its portfolio companies.

In addition to his role at KKR, Mehlman is a trustee of New York&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, and Teach for America. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, serves as chairman of the American Investment Council (previously the Private Equity Growth Capital Council), and is co-Chairman of the American Enterprise Institute&#x27;s National Council. He is also a trustee and board member of Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO). Mehlman was appointed to the board of directors of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board in June, 2016.

On January 10, 2017, Mark Zuckerberg announced on Facebook that Mehlman and David Plouffe would be joining the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Mehlman will chair the philanthropy&#x27;s public policy advisory board, which he stated in his official Facebook post will consist of &quot;a diverse group of advisors and experts.&quot;

On March 4, 2021, Mehlman was elected to the board of directors of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).

==Republican National Committee chairmanship==
Mehlman was Bush&#x27;s choice to replace Ed Gillespie as the chair of the Republican National Committee and was elected to the post on January 19, 2005. Mehlman announced after the November 2006 general election that he would not seek re-election to another term as Republican National Chairman. One of his top deputies, RNC political Director Michael DuHaime, announced in December 2006 that he would become campaign manager for Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

Mehlman addressed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) a full year before Bush addressed the civil rights organization. In his address to the NAACP on July 14, 2005, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Mehlman apologized for his party&#x27;s failure to reach out to the black community in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, stating, &quot;Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization... I am here as Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.&quot;

Although Mehlman&#x27;s speech seemed to suggest a new approach towards the African-American community, most have considered the approach to be unsuccessful, with several polls indicating that Republicans have not improved in terms of African-American approval. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; poll shows that Bush&#x27;s approval rating among African Americans fell to two percent at one point, and a report card issued by the NAACP gave &quot;F&#x27;s&quot; to a majority of Republicans in the 109th Congress.

As the head of the RNC, Mehlman played a key role, along with Karl Rove, in executing the Republican Party&#x27;s long-term, yet ultimately unsuccessful, plan for electoral dominance. This is discussed at length in Peter Wallsten and Tom Hamburger&#x27;s book, &quot;One Party Country&quot;. Mehlman voluntarily stepped down as chairman of the RNC at the end of 2006. He was succeeded by Mike Duncan and Mel Martinez.

In 2016, Mehlman was a vocal opponent of Donald Trump&#x27;s in the primary and general election, and he publicly vowed to vote for Hillary Clinton.

== Phone jamming scandal==

A Democratic analysis of phone records introduced at the 2005 criminal trial of James Tobin, the Northeast political director for the RNC in 2002, shows that Mehlman made 115 outgoing calls – mostly to the same number in the White House office of political affairs – between September 17 and November 22, 2002, when the office of political affairs was headed by Mehlman. Two dozen calls were made from 9:28 a.m. the day before the election through 2:17 a.m. on the night after the voting, a three-day period. Virtually all the calls to the White House went to the same phone number. In April 2006, Mehlman issued a statement on the matter, noting that his deputy for the Northeast states routinely discussed election business with RNC officials, and categorically stated that &quot;none of my conversations nor the conversations of my staff, involved discussion of the phone-jamming incident.&quot; Tobin was convicted on December 15, 2005 &quot;for his part in a plot to jam the Democratic Party&#x27;s phones on Election Day 2002&quot;; however, this conviction was later overturned by a federal appeals court and Tobin was acquitted on all charges.

==Coming out==
In August 2010, Mehlman revealed that he is gay. Prior to this revelation, rumors about Mehlman&#x27;s sexual orientation had circulated since at least 2004. In May 2006, Mehlman denied he was gay, telling the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m not gay, but those stories did a number on my dating life for six months.&quot; On November 8, 2006, comedian Bill Maher made an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, during which he referred to Mehlman as a closeted gay man. The incident became controversial because CNN edited out Maher&#x27;s comments in later taped editions and removed the reference to Mehlman&#x27;s sexual orientation from the transcript of the show. The day after Maher&#x27;s comments, Mehlman announced he would step down as chairman of the RNC (although reports said that his resignation had been expected for some time).

Almost four years later, in an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Mehlman stated that he is in fact gay, and that he planned to be an advocate for legalizing same-sex marriage. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Mehlman&#x27;s &quot;announcement makes him apparently the most prominent Republican official to come out.&quot; This disclosure followed years of him avoiding and denying inquiries about his sexual orientation. During his RNC chairmanship, Mehlman supported certain positions of the Republican Party, including opposition to same-sex marriage. Mehlman stated he could not have gone against party consensus, but acknowledged that, had he come out of the closet earlier, he might have been able to impact Republican efforts to pass state initiatives and referendums banning same-sex marriage.

===Reactions===
Marc Ambinder, who interviewed Mehlman and wrote &quot;The Atlantic&quot; article, said that Mehlman&#x27;s roles with the RNC and the Bush campaign &quot;coincided with the Republican Party&#x27;s attempts to exploit anti-gay prejudices and cement the allegiance of social conservatives&quot;. A few commentators, such as Cenk Uygur and Michael Rogers, criticized Mehlman on &quot;The Ed Show&quot;, for having remained closeted about his sexuality while active in politics. Rogers has long advocated for the forced outing of closeted gay politicians who vote or advocate against LGBT interests.

Some segments of the LGBT community expressed support for Mehlman. Dustin Lance Black, the Academy Award-winning writer of &quot;Milk,&quot; said, &quot;Ken represents an incredible coup for the American Foundation for Equal Rights ... As a victorious former presidential campaign manager and head of the Republican Party, Ken has the proven experience and expertise to help us communicate with people across each of the 50 states.&quot; Stephen Petrow, former president of the National Lesbian &amp; Gay Journalists Association, wrote in a Huffington Post column, &quot;... the 43-year old Mehlman found the courage to be honest about his identity with family, friends, former colleagues and current colleagues [who have] been wonderful and supportive.&quot; Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund President and CEO Chuck Wolfe said in a public statement, &quot;We hope the fact that Ken Mehlman has reached this level of honesty will now encourage other political leaders to reject divisive anti-gay campaign tactics...&quot;

==Equal rights advocacy==
===Support for same-sex marriage===
In June 2011, Mehlman lobbied Republican members of the New York state legislature to support the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York and reached out to conservative donors and operatives.

Mehlman often spoke with undecided GOP senators, including three of the four who eventually voted in favor of the bill. Mehlman, who gained the support of many gay-rights backers, discussed the political and ideological reasons why lawmakers should vote for the bill. He said, &quot;Letting two adults who love each other get married strengthens and promotes families.&quot; Mehlman told GOP senators that legalizing same-sex marriage aligned with Republican interests and principles. He emphasized that polls showed a significant shift toward voter support of same-sex marriage. Four Republican senators voted for the Marriage Equality Act.

Several gay rights leaders and bloggers recognized Mehlman&#x27;s role. Mehlman was honored in &quot;Out Magazine&quot; 2011&#x27;s Out100 list partially because of his work on the campaign. Mehlman has been active in Maryland, New Hampshire and Washington State, helping to raise almost $3 million for these campaigns between August 2010 (when he came out) and March 2012. He continued to campaign for same-sex marriage, before &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, the 2013 United States Supreme Court decision which held that same-sex marriage is constitutional, by aiming to show GOP leaders why same-sex marriage &quot;is consistent with Republican and conservative principles&quot;, and speaking on that topic throughout the country.

In January 2013, also before &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, Mehlman spoke with political activist David Kochel in Iowa about how supporting same-sex marriage is a conservative value. He stated that, &quot;I&#x27;m a conservative because I believe in more freedom and I believe in less government. I think that we are endowed by our Creator, not by politicians, not by government, not by bureaucrats, with inalienable rights, including the pursuit of happiness. If you believe that, what could be more central to the pursuit of happiness than choosing the person that you love, that you have the right to marry?&quot;

In February 2013, Mehlman helped organize an amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court in the case of California Proposition 8 signed by dozens of prominent socially moderate Republicans, including Jon Huntsman, Jr., Meg Whitman, Ken Duberstein, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and others, explaining that they supported a Constitutional right to same-sex marriage. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Ken Mehlman spent &quot;months in quiet conversations with fellow Republicans to gather signatures for the brief.&quot; &quot;We are trying to say to the court that we are judicial and political conservatives, and it is consistent with our values and philosophy for you to overturn Proposition 8,&quot; said Ken Mehlman according to the New York Times report.

In November 2013, Mehlman launched a non-profit organization called Project Right Side focused on convincing more Republicans to support marriage equality. The organization also conducts research and analysis in an effort to improve political conditions for LGBTQ issues. He stated that &quot;Conservatives don&#x27;t need to change core convictions to embrace the growing support for equal rights for gay Americans. It is sufficient to recognize the inherent conservatism in citizens&#x27; desire to marry, to be judged on their work, and not to be singled out for higher taxes or bullying at school. These objectives can be achieved while also protecting religious liberty, as demonstrated by states enacting civil marriage with exemptions for religious institutions.&quot;

In February 2014, Mehlman was a keynote speaker at the first campus-wide Harvard LGBTQ conference on the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots where he was interviewed by Baruch Shemtov. He spoke during the closing remarks of the conference, stating &quot;there&#x27;s nothing more powerful than coming out and being who you are.&quot;

===Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell legislation===
Mehlman supported the repeal of the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; military policy introduced during President Bill Clinton&#x27;s tenure. In 2010, Mehlman lobbied ten U.S. Senators to repeal the policy.

===Workplace discrimination===
Mehlman has also worked on LGBTQ non-discrimination issues. He actively helped Congressional leaders pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in the Senate in 2013. In July 2019, Mehlman filed an amicus brief, joined by close to three dozen other Republican leaders, arguing in support of the rights of LGBT people in the workplace. The brief argued that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly prohibits discrimination against gay men, lesbians and transgender people in the workplace due to language in the law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. In addition, Mehlman wrote an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot; outlining his reasons for believing that the fight for gay rights upholds the Republican values of economic freedom and personal liberty. In the piece, Mehlman writes that firing an employee because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is &quot;... unethical and un-American, and the Supreme Court has the opportunity to read the clear language of Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act] and affirm that it is illegal.&quot;

==Personal life==
Mehlman is Jewish and lives in New York City.

<doc id="1301271" wikidata="Q4845705" url="?curid=1301271" title="James Cleveland">
<text>James Edward Cleveland (December 5, 1931 – February 9, 1991) was an American gospel singer, musician, and composer. Known as the &quot;King of Gospel,&quot; Cleveland was a driving force behind the creation of the modern gospel sound by incorporating traditional black gospel, soul, pop, and jazz in arrangements for mass choirs.

Throughout his career, Cleveland appeared on hundreds of recordings and earned four Grammy Awards. He was the first gospel musician to earn a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1984. For his trailblazing accomplishments, he is regarded by many as one of the greatest gospel singers who ever lived.

His best known recordings include &quot;Lord, Help Me to Hold Out&quot;, &quot;Peace Be Still&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel No Ways Tired&quot;, “Where Is Your Faith&quot;, &quot;The Love of God&quot;, &quot;God Has Smiled on Me&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Is the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me.&quot;

==Early life and career==

Born in Chicago, Cleveland began singing as a boy soprano at Pilgrim Baptist Church where Thomas A. Dorsey was minister of music and Roberta Martin was pianist for the choir. He strained his vocal cords as a teenager while part of a local gospel group; this was said to contribute to the distinctive, gravelly voice which became a hallmark of his later in his career.

As a teenager, Cleveland was a part of a missionary group, Soul Winners for Christ which was created by his teenage friend Jessie Jimerson Phillips. Phillips would go on in later years to write Roberta Martin&#x27;s last recorded song, &quot;I Have Hope&quot;. Soul Winners for Christ also included a young Richard D. Henton and was headquartered at Chicago&#x27;s Greater Harvest Baptist Church; Louis H. Boddie was pastor. The change in his voice led Cleveland to focus on his skills as a pianist, and later as a composer and arranger. Also produced and co wrote songs with Aretha Franklin for her multi award and multi million sales best selling album &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. With songs that included &quot;Precious Memories&quot;, &quot;God will take care of you&quot; and &quot;Mary Don&#x27;t You Weep&quot;.

==Musical career==
===The Gospelaires===
In 1950, Cleveland joined the Gospelaires, a trio led by Norsalus McKissick and Bessie Folk. His arrangements modernized such traditional standards as &quot;(Give Me That) Old Time Religion&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Me, O Lord&quot;. After the trio disbanded, an associate of the group, Roberta Martin, hired him as a composer and arranger. The song that brought Cleveland tremendous fame was his rendition of &quot;Peace Be Still&quot;.

===Albertina Walker &amp; The Caravans===
Cleveland went to work with childhood friend Albertina Walker, founder of The Caravans, as a composer, arranger, pianist, and occasional singer as well as a narrator.

The Caravans became the launching pad for today&#x27;s gospel legends. Besides Cleveland, the group counted among its membership several gospel luminaries including Shirley Caesar, known as the First Lady of Gospel; Cassietta George, who co-wrote some of the group&#x27;s best hits; Delores Washington; Josephine Howard, mother to R&amp;B artist Miki Howard; Inez Andrews, whose song &quot;Mary, Don&#x27;t You Weep&quot; became a staple in the industry; Dorothy Norwood, known as Gospel&#x27;s Greatest Storyteller; James Heron; Loleatta Holloway, who became a legendary dance recording artist in the late 1970s; and several others.

In November 1954, Walker provided Cleveland the opportunity to do his very first recording. By staying out of the studio for a while, she convinced States Records to allow him to record with her group. He continued to record with The Caravans until States closed down in 1957. Cleveland would later reunite with Walker in the late 1970s with two album releases: &quot;Reunion&quot;, released in 1977, and the iconic classic &quot;Please Be Patient With Me&quot;, released in 1979 with the Trinity All Nations Choir of Chicago. This album earned Walker her first gold record.

In 1959, he recorded a version of Ray Charles&#x27; hit &quot;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&quot; as a solo artist. By 1960, Cleveland, who had incorporated blues riffs in his work – and what Anthony Heilbut described as &quot;sheer funkiness&quot; – had become associated with a new tenor in gospel music. He became known by more than just the professionals within gospel music with his version of the Soul Stirrers&#x27; song, &quot;The Love of God&quot;, backed by the Voices of Tabernacle from Detroit. The success and sensation of the song&#x27;s recording led to a record contract with an historic label that would change his life forever.

===Savoy Records===
James Cleveland signed with the historic jazz label Savoy Records in 1962, going on to release a huge catalog of soul gospel recordings from that year until his death in 1991, many of which were recorded in a live concert setting. The live concert recording staple started with Reverend Lawrence Roberts, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Nutley, New Jersey, home of the famous Angelic Choir. Roberts liked the idea of capturing worship in song live on a recording where the listeners can feel and become of a part of the service. Working with Savoy&#x27;s executive producer Fred Mendelsohn, Cleveland and the Angelic Choir of Nutley released two albums before recording the iconic masterpiece, &quot;Peace Be Still&quot;, in September 1963, which sold thousands of copies at that time and garnered Cleveland his first gold album. &quot;Peace Be Still&quot; also stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for at least fifteen years after its release.

===The Cleveland Singers===
Cleveland moved to Los Angeles to become Minister of Music at Grace Memorial Church of God in Christ, where he attained even greater popularity working with keyboardist Billy Preston and the Angelic Choir of Nutley, New Jersey. He returned to touring with the newly organized James Cleveland Singers, which included Odessa McCastle, Georgia White, Eugene Bryant, and Billy Preston, among others. In 1964, Cleveland re-organized The James Cleveland Singers, which included Odessa McCastle, Roger Roberts, and Gene Viale (who was the first Latin-American to integrate soul gospel and sing with the Cleveland Singers).

In 1965, Cleveland added Clyde Brown and Charles Barnett to his group, which by then was traveling extensively throughout the United States and abroad into the late 1960s, performing in all major venues. This collaboration produced such recordings as &quot;Heaven That Will Be Good Enough For Me&quot;, &quot;Two Wings&quot;, and &quot;The Lord Is Blessing Me Right Now&quot;.

Other singers were added in later years, including Marva Hines and renowned soprano soloist, Cleo Kennedy. They were mainstays until Cleveland&#x27;s death in 1991.

===The Southern California Community Choir===
Cleveland capitalized on his success by founding his own choir, the Southern California Community Choir. After being nominated numerous times in previous years, James won his first Grammy Award with the Southern California Community Choir in 1975, for his 1974 album, &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;.

He recorded several albums with SCC between the years of 1970 and 1990. Their most successful albums were the 1979 Grammy-nominated release, &quot;It&#x27;s a New Day&quot;, featuring the industry&#x27;s signature staple, &quot;God Is&quot;; and their 1981 release, &quot;Where Is Your Faith&quot;; among many others. His final Grammy Award was issued posthumously after his passing in 1991, for his final album with SCC, &quot;Having Church&quot;, which features Cleveland&#x27;s iconic rendition of Tramaine Hawkins&#x27; signature &quot;What Shall I Do?&quot;, written and composed by Quincy Fielding.

===Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church===
In November 1970, Cleveland founded his own ministry and church, Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church, in Los Angeles which grew from ten to thousands of members throughout the remainder of his life. His first album with the church choir, The Voices of Cornerstone, was released in 1980, which featured a wonderful rendition by Cleveland of &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&quot;, and the title track, &quot;A Praying Spirit&quot;, written by Elbernita &quot;Twinkie&quot; Clark and recorded by The Clark Sisters. The church choir&#x27;s second album, &quot;My Expectations&quot;, was released in 1981 to moderate acclaim. By the time of his death the church membership was over 7,000.

===James Cleveland Presents===
From the 1970s until 1990, Cleveland would bring together a number of artists to back him on appearances and records. He also continued to introduce, appear, and record with some of the most notable gospel choirs and independent artists of the time – many of whom became legends in their own right including The Donald Vails Choraleers (Detroit); The Harold Smith Majestics, with whom he recorded the classic &quot;Lord, Help Me to Hold Out&quot;; The Los Angeles Gospel Messengers, the last choir to record with Cleveland before he passed; New Jerusalem Baptist Church Choir from Flint, Michigan; Henry Jackson; The Craig Brothers; The Salem Inspirational Choir from Omaha, Nebraska, with whom he recorded the iconic staple &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Noways Tired&quot;; Richard &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; White; Bishop Albert Jamison &amp; the Triboro Mass Choir; Issac Whittmon; Marva Hines; Debbie Austin; The Fourth of May; Quentella Caldwell; Sara Jordan Powell; The Philadelphia Mass Choir; The Houston Mass Choir; The New Jersey Mass Choir; and the award-winning Charles Fold Singers, from Cincinnati, Ohio, with whom Cleveland recorded five albums, including the Grammy-winning 1979 release, &quot;Make Me an Instrument&quot;.

Additionally, Cleveland himself backed other acts, contributing to the recordings of well-known artists such as Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, and Elton John.

===Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;===
Cleveland also moved to Detroit in the 1960s to take a position as music director at the famed New Bethel Baptist Church, where C. L. Franklin, father of the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, was pastor. In 1972, James collaborated with Aretha on her historic Grammy-winning and multi-million-selling album &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, which is known as the Greatest Gospel Album of All Time. Recorded live at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts in Los Angeles, with his Southern California Community Choir, his feature on the album and Aretha&#x27;s success as a pop artist made the album a historic landmark in gospel, and is still selling to this day, with a special CD re-release of &quot;The Complete Recordings&quot; (the unedited album recording session of the &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; project).

This historic recording was also filmed by director Sydney Pollack for an intended documentary release, but due to a technical issue of not using a clapperboard to synchronize the audio with the video, the film was deemed unusable, and was left shelved for the next 47 years. Before he died, Pollack authorized producer Alan Elliott to try to complete the film. Initially unaware of the sound synchronization problem, Elliot mortgaged his own house to buy the film negative from Warner Brothers, but was able to use modern technology to bring audio and video together successfully. The completed documentary was finally released in April 2019, playing in select theaters across the world, with a premier at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church itself.

===&quot;Gospel: The Motion Picture&quot;===
The historic documentary film &quot;Gospel&quot;, released in 1983, features James Cleveland for the first time on the motion picture screen, along with the Southern California Community Choir, Walter Hawkins &amp; the Family, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, Shirley Caesar, and The Clark Sisters. The film was directed by David Leivick and Frederick A. Ritzenberg. Excerpts from the film soundtrack was released on Savoy Records and became a top seller, with Cleveland having the majority feature on side two of the album.

==Gospel Music Workshop of America==
In 1968, Cleveland taught others how to achieve the modern gospel sound and preserve the industry&#x27;s rich legacy through his annual workshop convention, The Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA), an organization that he co-founded with Albertina Walker and which now has over 150 chapters with 30,000 members. The GMWA has featured and produced the likes of Donald Vails, Issac Douglas, Myrna Summers, Harold Ivory Williams Jr., Sara Jordan Powell, Daryl Coley, John P. Kee, Kirk Franklin, Kurt Carr, Donald Lawrence, and Yolanda Adams. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together singers from all over the country in order to perpetuate the art of gospel music. The workshops eventually attracted thousands of adherents and laid the groundwork for the popularity of gospel music. The last album Cleveland recorded with the GMWA was their 1990 release from the previous year&#x27;s annual convention in New Orleans.

==Gospel renditions of pop songs==
Throughout his recording career, Cleveland started a trend and was famously known for taking some of the greatest pop, R&amp;B, and soul songs and transforming them into gospel anthems. Out of all the mainstream pop songs he rearranged for gospel audiences, his most memorable is his classic rendition of Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me,&quot; which he changed to &quot;Jesus Is the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me.&quot; This rendition earned him a Grammy nomination when it was released in 1975 as his first recording with the Charles Fold Singers of Cincinnati, Ohio. Another memorable gospel rendition was of Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;I Write the Songs,&quot; which he recorded on his 1977 Grammy-winning album, &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall.&quot; The last song rendition he presented was Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Have It All,&quot; known as &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad You Know the Lord,&quot; which Cleveland recorded in 1989 with the Northern and Southern California Choirs of the GMWA on the album &quot;Breathe on Me&quot;, featuring Daryl Coley and current Savoy Records executive producer Milton Biggham.

==King James Records==
From 1985 to 1988, Cleveland launched his own independent record label, King James Records, which was manufactured and distributed by Detroit&#x27;s own Sound of Gospel/Nine Records, Inc. Under his label he released three albums with the GMWA; one solo release; Billy Preston&#x27;s first gospel album; two albums with the Los Angeles Gospel Messengers, which includes their first, most popular release, &quot;Praise 88&quot;; an album with his iconic Southern California Community Choir; and a resurgence of his James Cleveland Presents series, which brought back The Craig Brothers, The Fourth of May, and introduced The Harmonizing Four. Cleveland&#x27;s record label folded after the distributor closed.

==Death==
On February 9, 1991, James Cleveland died in Culver City, California. He was 59. Some reports list the cause of death as congestive heart failure stating that the singer had fallen into a coma shortly before his death. Over 8,000 people gathered for his funeral service at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. He is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==Controversy==
===Estate and inheritance matters===
Following Cleveland&#x27;s death in February 1991, a number of controversies arose surrounding his estate, which at the time was estimated to be worth between $4 and $6 million.

====Andre M. Cleveland====
In October 1991, music producer Andre M. Cleveland (then aged 34) filed suit against James Cleveland&#x27;s estate, claiming to be Cleveland&#x27;s adopted son.

====Jean Ervin/LaShone Cleveland====
Also in October 1991, Jean Ervin, a member of the Cleveland-founded Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church, claimed that she was the mother of Cleveland&#x27;s only biological child, daughter LaShone Cleveland (b. 1965). Ervin also said that she believed that Andre M. Cleveland was not adopted as he claimed, but was merely one of the many &quot;homeless&quot; children that the late-singer took into his home over the years.

===Abuse and infection allegations by Christopher Harris===
In February 1992, Cleveland&#x27;s then-foster son, Christopher Harris (formerly Christopher Harris Cleveland), filed a lawsuit against Cleveland&#x27;s estate, claiming that Cleveland allegedly sexually abused him over a period of five years and infected him with the HIV virus, which he claims Cleveland contracted through same-sex liaisons. The case was settled with undisclosed terms. According to Heilbut (2012), Cleveland was widely recognized as gay in the gospel circuit.

<doc id="1301275" wikidata="Q2979377" url="?curid=1301275" title="Alberta clipper">
<text>An Alberta clipper, also known as an Alberta low, Alberta cyclone, Alberta lee cyclone, Canadian clipper, or simply clipper, is a fast-moving low-pressure system that originates in or near the Canadian province of Alberta just east of the Rocky Mountains and tracks east-southeastward across southern Canada and the northern United States to the North Atlantic Ocean.

Alberta clippers constitute a major winter-season storm track for extratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, tracking across the continent in 2–3 days while affecting weather in parts of the Prairies and central provinces of Canada, as well as the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and New England portions of the United States. They are associated with cold, dry continental air masses and generate small-scale, short-lived weather events typically producing of snow in a 3-6 hour period. However, they can precipitate sudden temperature drops and sharp winds leading to local blizzard conditions, especially when interacting with moisture from the Great Lakes.

== Etymology ==
Alberta clippers take their name from Alberta, the province from which they appear to descend, and from clipper ships of the 19th century, one of the fastest ships of that time.

The term was coined in the late 1960s by Rheinhart Harms, a meteorologist at the U.S. National Weather Service Office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who noted the rapid speed of these snow-producing storms as they moved across the Dakotas from Alberta towards the Great Lakes. Its colloquial use spread among U.S. and Canadian weather forecasters in the early 1970s. It would enter the scientific literature around the 1990s. 
Storms beginning their southward treks from other Canadian provinces, far less common than clippers, are often still referred to as clippers, or by the fanciful names &quot;Saskatchewan screamer&quot;, &quot;Manitoba mauler&quot; or &quot;Ontario scari-o&quot;.

==Formation==
A clipper originates when warm, moist winds from the Pacific Ocean come into contact with the mountains in the provinces of British Columbia and then Alberta. The air travels down the lee side of the mountains, often forming a chinook in Alberta, then develops into a storm over the Canadian prairies when it becomes entangled with the cold air mass that normally occupies that region in winter. The storm then moves east-southeast riding the jet stream, and passes off the upper Atlantic Coast, normally north of Delaware Bay.

The chinook, which in part originates the Alberta clipper, usually brings relatively warm weather (often approaching in the depths of winter) to southern Alberta itself, and the term is therefore not used in Alberta.

==Effects==
The storms sweep in at high speed over whatever land they encounter, usually bringing with them sharp cold fronts and drastically lower temperatures. It is not uncommon for an Alberta clipper to cause temperatures to drop by in as little as 10 to 12 hours. Often, the storms bring biting winds with them, only increasing the effect of the lower temperatures. Winds in advance of and during an Alberta clipper are frequently as high as . These conditions would cause wind chill values to drop into the range across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes.

Snowfall amounts with these systems tend to be small (on the order of ), as the relative lack of moisture and quick movement inhibit substantial snowfall totals. However, several factors could combine to produce higher snow accumulations ( or more). These factors include access to more moisture (which raises precipitation amounts), slower system movement (which increases snowfall duration), and colder temperatures (which increases the snow to water ratio). The southern and eastern shores of the Great Lakes often receive enhanced snowfall from Alberta clippers during the winter, due to lake enhancement. The lake-effect snow can add substantially to the overall snowfall total.

Occasionally the clippers, when reaching the upper Atlantic seaboard (usually north of Delaware), &quot;bomb out&quot; and can cause severe winter weather along the coast from Boston northward as Atlantic moisture is tapped. Snowfall amounts can approach or more when this happens. However, typically, Alberta clippers are not large snow producers south of Boston.

During the winter, Alberta clippers can occur somewhat frequently, with system intervals on the order of two to four days common during active periods.

<doc id="1301277" wikidata="Q1132597" url="?curid=1301277" title="Soap opera rapid aging syndrome">
<text>Soap opera rapid aging syndrome (SORAS) is the practice of accelerating the age of a television or film character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series or the real-world progression of time. This allows, for instance, storylines around a pregnancy and birth to be relatively quickly followed by storylines around the travails of that child as a teenager or young adult. This is usually accomplished by recasting the actor playing the part, although in some cases the character is not shown onscreen, only mentioned, until after they have been &quot;rapidly aged&quot;.

The process originated (and is most commonly used) in daytime soap operas, though it is also sometimes used in prime time shows. On sitcoms, a newborn infant character is sometimes aged quickly into a kindergartener, for greater comic potential, as was done with the character Chrissy Seaver on &quot;Growing Pains&quot; in 1990.

The term was coined by &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; founding editor-in-chief Mimi Torchin in the early days of the magazine, which began publishing in 1989. It is now widely used in soap operas and is sometimes used as a verb as well (&quot;the character was SORASed&quot;). Torchin has jokingly called it &quot;my one greatest contribution to the world of soap operas.&quot;

== Examples ==
The practice of rapidly aging characters dates back to the early years of television soap opera. In &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, Tom Hughes was born onscreen in 1961. By 1970, he had been to college and fought in the Vietnam War. Subsequent recasting exhibited a reverse phenomenon, keeping him in his 30s for 20 years, with Tom hitting his 40s in the 1990s. Dan Stewart, born onscreen on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1958, reappeared as a 26-year-old doctor in 1966. A 1993 secret history storyline on &quot;All My Children&quot; established that lead character Erica Kane had been raped immediately before the series&#x27; 1970 debut. In this retcon, Erica represses all memory of the assault until 16-year-old Kendall Hart, the child conceived during the rape and put up for adoption by Erica, appears in 1993. Viewer reaction to the discrepancy created by Erica having a 16-year-old daughter as the result of a 24-year-old rape prompted the series to immediately adjust Kendall&#x27;s age to 23.

On the sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, the character Chrissy Seaver was born in October 1988. She was an infant for the remainder of season four (1988–1989) and a toddler (played by twin sisters Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring) in season five (1989–1990). However, for the final two seasons (6–7), Chrissy was rapidly aged to five. She was played by seven-year-old Ashley Johnson.

The repeated use of SORAS on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; led to characters Tom Horton and his great-great-grandson Scotty Banning both working as doctors in the same hospital at the same time.

&quot;Jersey Boys&quot; uses SORAS for Frankie Valli&#x27;s daughter, Francine. Through the first three quarters of the musical and film, she ages in real time with the narrative, then jumps several years ahead while the story remains in the late 1960s, to the point that her 1980 death occurs at roughly the same time of the narrative as Valli&#x27;s 1967 hit solo record &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You.&quot;

<text>Wipeout 2097 (released as Wipeout XL in North America and Japan) is a 1996 racing video game developed and published by Psygnosis for the PlayStation. It is the second installment of the &quot;Wipeout series&quot; and a sequel to the original game, released the previous year. It was ported the following year to Microsoft Windows and the Sega Saturn, and later also to Amiga and Macintosh.

Whereas the original game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; is set over four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and more dangerous F5000 AG racing league. The game introduced a new damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3D Control Pad, whereas the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional NeGcon twist controller.

&quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; received critical acclaim upon release; reviewers praised the game for its dramatic improvements to the controls, graphics, and gameplay of the original &quot;Wipeout&quot;. The game featured a licensed electronic soundtrack featuring artists such as The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy, an early example of modern licensed music being used in video games. &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; alongside its predecessor has since appeared on lists of the greatest games of all time by multiple publications.

== Gameplay ==

Gameplay in &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; expands upon its predecessor, introducing new circuits and weapons while retaining fundamental aspects. Players race against computer-controlled artificial opponents or other pilots, aiming to finish in the highest position possible. The game features futuristic hover vehicles that handle differently from traditional racing cars. The craft move at high speeds, with air-brakes used for cornering.

&quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; introduces a weapons system, allowing players to eliminate opponents during races. Each vehicle has a shield energy quota, and when this reaches zero from weapon attacks or impacts, the craft is destroyed. However, the ship can be &quot;recharged&quot; to health at the pit stop in exchange for a precious few seconds of the race. The Quake Disruptor is a notable new weapon, causing a wave effect on the track that launches opponent vehicles into the air.

The game offers multiple difficulty levels, called classes: Vector, Venom, and Rapier. Each class increases in challenge, with higher speeds and more complex tracks. &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; features a progression system where players can unlock additional content. Winning gold medals across all tracks in the first three classes unlocks a full season mode. Completing this season reveals additional hidden options, including new tracks. Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric approach by only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position.

The game includes multiple racing teams, each with vehicles that handle differently. FEISAR, the European team, offers a balanced vehicle with good turning and strong shields, suitable for beginners learning the tracks. Auricom, the American team, provides faster vehicles than FEISAR and AG Systems, designed for more experienced racers. AG Systems, the Japanese team, features a vehicle with higher speed than FEISAR&#x27;s but less cornering ability. Qirex, the Russian team, offers the fastest vehicles in the game, but with reduced steering capabilities. Each team&#x27;s vehicle has its own strengths and weaknesses, allowing players to choose based on their preferred driving style and skill level.

== Development ==
As with the first installment, &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; was developed by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and the promotional art was designed by Sheffield-based The Designers Republic. The development cycle ran for seven months. To cater for the increase in &quot;Wipeout&quot; players, an easier learning curve was introduced whilst keeping the difficulty at the top end for the experienced gamers. The game was originally intended as a tracks add-on for the original &quot;Wipeout&quot;. No sequel had been planned, but Andy Satterthwaite (who worked on the MS-DOS version of the original) was asked by Psygnosis to apply for the role &quot;internal producer&quot;. He did, and during the interview, asked to do a sequel to &quot;Wipeout&quot;, but instead ended up developing extra tracks. The add-on was titled &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; because Psygnosis did not want to give the impression that it was a full sequel. In the United States, it went by the name of &quot;Wipeout XL&quot; because it was felt that American players would not understand the concept of the game being set a century in the future, and might confuse it for an installment number. The American title was originally to be &quot;Wipeout XS&quot; (for &quot;Excess&quot;), but it was pointed out that XS could also stand for &quot;extra small&quot;. Satterthwaite ended up with a team of three coders (two of whom were new), six artists, and Nick Burcombe.

The game&#x27;s look was influenced by Japanese culture because the team had worked with The Designers Republic. Nicky Westcott was the lead artist, and her team built on the original vehicle designs. She also worked with the designers and coders on the tracks. Custom tools were created in Softimage to develop the tracks, which were tweaked and the team played each other&#x27;s tracks to obtain feedback. During the process, Satterthwaite realised that he could do more than the tracks add-on he was tasked with producing. Work on the tracks began in January 1996, and the plan was to select eight tracks out of twenty designed and built in a month. Their &quot;skinning&quot; was expected to be complete by June, with the game anticipated for release in October. Despite the work involved, Satterthwaite had three uninvolved coders. The collision code from the original &quot;Wipeout&quot; was also completely overhauled to make cornering easier by making wall grinding not bring the player to such a halt.

Burcombe wanted to improve on the original&#x27;s ship handling and introduce a new weapon, which led to new power-up ideas. Westcott said that it was a collaboration between the areas because of the strict deadline. The gameplay change that had the most interest was what happened to ships that hit track edges. That ships stopped immediately in the original game was considered too harsh. It was desired that ships scraped the edges instead, and this took longer than expected to develop. Ghost vehicles were only featured in the European version because Atari had a patent on them from &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; in the United States. The team wanted to make it possible to win races in any ship, and a challenge was to make them all feel different and to still have their worth. Months of work rebalancing the artificial intelligence was undertaken to ensure all vehicle and track settings were a challenge. Sony wanted a link-up feature, which proved difficult due to syncing issues and the frame rate differences between PAL and NTSC. Much extra content, such as more difficult tracks and a prototype ship, was added because, according to Westcott, the team were both enthusiastic and stressed, and described their development as &quot;a period of great energy and immense exhaustion at the same time&quot;.

An entire United Kingdom nightclub tour was initiated in conjunction with the Red Bull energy drink, which was featured prominently throughout the game before the drink actually gained popularity in the American market.

The game was first unveiled in the form of a pre-alpha demo at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo. &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; was released in 1996 and sold around a million copies. Ports for the Sega Saturn, and Windows PC were released in 1997. Later it was also ported to Amiga by Digital Images in 1999 and to Mac OS by Coderus in 2002.

== Music ==
The original &quot;Wipeout&quot; game was one of the first racing titles to prominently feature electronic music, including tracks by artists such as Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, and Orbital. This use of licensed music was unconventional for the time and helped establish the series’ identity. The game and its soundtrack drew heavily on the &quot;&#x27;future UK&quot;&#x27; aesthetic of the 1990s—a style defined by techno-inspired visuals and the rise of electronic music and rave culture. Its marketing campaign, aimed at a young, club-going audience, further emphasised the connection between the game and the rave culture of the 1990s. 

&quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, released as &quot;Wipeout XL&quot; in North America, expanded upon this foundation with a soundtrack that featured a wider array of high-profile electronic music artists. Tracks by The Prodigy, Fluke, Underworld, and Photek were included, alongside returning contributors Leftfield and The Chemical Brothers. The game’s music played a key role in defining its high-energy, futuristic atmosphere, with the soundtrack often being associated with the mid-90s rise of big beat and techno music. Fluke contributed the track &quot;Atom Bomb&quot;, which was created specifically for the game and accompanied by a music video set in the &quot;Wipeout&quot; universe.

In addition to licensed tracks, Tim Wright, known as CoLD SToRAGE, contributed original compositions to the game. Wright wanted his music to emphasise slower tempos while still maintaining a driving sense of energy to match the fast-paced visuals of &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;. To achieve this, he leaned heavily into the big beat sound, inspired by artists like The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. The style’s heavy basslines, prominent drops, and use of samples allowed Wright to maintain an adrenaline-pumping atmosphere despite the slower tempo. Wright noted that it was difficult to get his tracks into the game due to the larger number of high-profile artists featured on the soundtrack.

Sony promoted &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; by showcasing PlayStation consoles running the game in nightclub settings. They also released a line of branded clubwear inspired by the game. Additionally, the &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; game disc doubled as an audio CD, allowing players to listen to the soundtrack directly, and a separate album with a different tracklist was also released.

== Reception ==
===PlayStation===
In the United Kingdom, it was among the nineteen best-selling PlayStation games of 1996, according to HMV.

Air Hendrix scored the PlayStation version a perfect 5 out of 5 in every category (FunFactor, control, sound, and graphics) in &quot;GamePro&quot;, citing &quot;across-the-board innovations&quot; over the already excellent original &quot;WipeOut&quot;. He particularly remarked that the controls are much more refined, fairer, and easier to master, and that the frame rate and graphical effects are much more impressive. Tom Ham of &quot;GameSpot&quot; also commented on the control improvements and approved of the new ability to destroy opponents. Additionally praising the elaborate backgrounds, detailed sound effects, and more aggressive A.I., he deemed it &quot;a must buy.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; said that it had topped the original in terms of music, number of simultaneous racers, A.I., weapons, and graphics, and concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s games like this that make you proud to be a PlayStation owner.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; as the 32nd top game of all time for how &quot;playing linked &quot;Wipeout&quot; comes close to gaming at its very best&quot;, noting that the game could have been a technology demonstration for PlayStation. &quot;Edge&quot; gave both the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions a score of 8 out of 10, with similar remarks of its improved graphics and its gameplay.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors awarded &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; Best Music of 1996 and a runner-up (behind &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;) for Best Graphics. In 1997, &quot;&quot; named it the fifth top PlayStation game yet, and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named the PlayStation version the 96th best game of all time, calling it &quot;the first game of the cyberpunk-esque &#x27;electronic age,&#x27; before the electronic age was just a hype-filled buzzword.&quot; In &quot;IGN&quot;″s top 25 PlayStation games of all-time list it ranked 13th, noted for being often considered the PlayStation&#x27;s best racing game of its time and was chosen ahead of others in the series because &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; was &quot;the one they preferred to keep coming back to&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. It ranks as the third-best PlayStation game at GameRankings with an average review score of 94.75% from ten different sources.

===Ports===
Rich Leadbetter of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; commented that the Saturn version, while not as good as the PlayStation original, is a much closer conversion than the Saturn port of the first &quot;Wipeout&quot;, particularly in terms of the fluidity, control, and sense of speed. He deemed it the second best racing game on the Saturn, exceeded only by &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;.

Jeff Gerstmann reviewed the PC version in &quot;GameSpot&quot;, assessing that &quot;The PC version&#x27;s Direct3D support gives this new release a nice face-lift, while still keeping intact the fast action and stylized graphics that console players have come to know and love.&quot; He said that the new soundtrack, while good, is a disappointment compared to the PlayStation version&#x27;s techno tracks, but gave the game a strong recommendation. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;If you have a 3D accelerator of any sort, you owe it to yourself to pick up this game. Its nearly flawless gameplay, pumping soundtrack, and visual excellence mark it as a showcase title and all around good time.&quot;

<doc id="1301287" wikidata="Q3015143" url="?curid=1301287" title="Wipeout 64">
<text>Wipeout 64 is a 1998 racing video game developed by Psygnosis and published by Midway Games for the Nintendo 64. It is the third game in the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series and remains the only one published on a Nintendo console. At the time of the game&#x27;s release, developer Psygnosis had been owned for five years by Sony Computer Entertainment, for whose hardware all subsequent &quot;Wipeout&quot; games have been released exclusively.

Set in 2098, a year after &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; introduced several new elements to the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series including analogue control which benefited from the Nintendo 64&#x27;s controller, new weapons, teams, and tracks. The game received generally positive reviews from critics. Many critics praised the game for its individuality among the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series, its graphics, offering more tracks and racing craft, unique atmosphere and &quot;superior track design&quot;, comparing the game favourably to Nintendo&#x27;s own &quot;F-Zero X&quot;. However, the game was criticised for its slow frame rate, and opinion is divided whether &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; is a &#x27;true sequel&#x27; to &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;.

==Gameplay==

Most aspects of the gameplay did not differ from the previous two titles. &quot;Wipeout&quot; is based on a futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer-controlled AI opponents to finish in the highest position possible. &quot;Wipeout&quot; gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, &quot;Wipeout&quot; uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.

&quot;Wipeout 64&quot; provides most of the same features as &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; along with new weapons unique to each team. New additions to the weapons interface include the ability to fire three rockets at a time and rear-locking missiles. Returning weapons include the homing missiles, machine guns and electro-bolts. Exclusive to &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; is an unlockable weapon power-up called the &quot;Cyclone&quot; which allows the player to strengthen the power of their weapons. There is also the inclusion of an elimination counter that gauges how many opponents were eliminated in a race by the player. This paved the way for the Eliminator mode introduced in &quot;Wipeout 3&quot;.

Unlike its predecessors that allowed split-screen between two players, &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; introduces split-screen for a maximum of four players for the first time. &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; also introduces a new addition named Challenge Mode where the player has to complete sets of challenges in predefined classes and tracks through either getting the fastest time in a Time Trial, the highest placing in a race, or eliminating the most opponents through a weaponry-based deathmatch.

Most of the tracks in &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; feature mirrored layouts of circuits from select tracks in &quot;Wipeout&quot; and &quot;Wipeout XL&quot;, set in different locations. Some conversions are not perfectly accurate, as some corners were eased or cut entirely, elevations were changed, and there were no split track sections.

==Development==
&quot;Wipeout 64&quot; was developed by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis. After rumors that several publishers had approached Psygnosis about developing a &quot;Wipeout&quot; installment for the Nintendo 64, Psygnosis officially announced &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; in April 1998. Development began in February 1998 and it took a total estimated amount of eight months to complete the game. Psygnosis originally intended to publish the game themselves with Sony Music Entertainment handling the distribution for Europe, but in September, Midway obtained publishing and distribution rights. It is a rare N64 title with noticeable load times, disguised by the request &#x27;Please Wait&#x27;, due to sound decompression times. &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; utilized the N64&#x27;s analogue stick, making ships more responsive than the series&#x27; predecessors. Rather than creating a full-fledged sequel to &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, Psygnosis decided to use &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; and tweak its design. Senior producer Andy Satterthwaite stated that &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; is a brand-new game and not a port of its predecessor, due to changes to the game structure, new race tracks, and new features. During development, Psygnosis were impressed with the precision of the Nintendo 64 controller&#x27;s control and were able to make the aircraft curve turns without sacrificing speed. One of the improvements that Psygnosis made from its predecessor is allowing the aircraft to hit the walls of the racetrack without coming to a complete halt.

===Audio===
Despite the limited capacity of a game cartridge, &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; fit nine music tracks, mostly by composers Rob Lord &amp; Mark Bandola (credited as &quot;PC MUSIC&quot; in-game), with additional tracks by Fluke and Propellerheads. Unlike both of its predecessors, Psygnosis&#x27; in-house music team, CoLD SToRAGE, did not produce music for this game, although CoLD SToRAGE&#x27;s works do make an appearance in future &quot;Wipeout&quot; games.

Race announcers bridge preceding &quot;Wipeouts&quot; and &quot;Wipeout 3&quot; by having a male voice declare what weapons are about to be used against the player; a female voice welcomes players to the courses and announces in-race events and the result.

==Reception==

&quot;Wipeout 64&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. The game received an aggregate score of 84/100 from Metacritic. Reviewers were generally impressed with the innovation and complexity the game offered; mostly stating that &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; had &quot;everything a futuristic racer needs, a large variety of tracks, well-designed craft, weapons, numerous game modes and speed&quot;.

The graphics were well-received from critics. &quot;IGN&quot; remarked that &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; was a superior game to &quot;F-Zero X&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game on its graphics, saying in the verdict that the visuals &quot;are absolutely beautiful&quot; and that the in-game soundtrack and sound-effects were &quot;top-notch&quot;, and that it included clean boost audio and excellent &quot;scrape&quot; noises. Despite the considerable praise, a mixed review came from Joe Fielder of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, saying that regarding the graphics, the visuals in &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; did not meet the par set by &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; that was released for the PlayStation two years prior. Fielder noted, however, that the new multiplayer mode was the game&#x27;s main advancement over the previous titles. &quot;Next Generation&quot; praised the game, stating that &quot;&quot;Wipeout&quot; provides a much sought-after experience and does it brilliantly&quot;.

Most reviews compared the game with &quot;F-Zero X&quot; which was released a month earlier, with the general assumption that Nintendo&#x27;s own futuristic racer offered more tracks and racing craft, but &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; contained superior track designs and atmosphere. &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the game, saying that &quot;&quot;WipeOut 64&quot; isn&#x27;t horrible, it just feels like the developer&#x27;s first effort for the system at timeswhich it is&quot;. &quot;Sayewonn&quot; of &quot;Gaming Age&quot; praised its new innovations, especially its analogue control, saying that &quot;adapting analogue controls was the biggest improvement racing games made and &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; demonstrates that beautifully&quot;. Sayewonn also noted that the game still had a &quot;learning curve&quot;, noting that &quot;it&#x27;s not as brutal as the first game but definitely harder than the far easier &quot;XL&quot;&quot;. Despite being complimentary of &quot;Wipeout 64&quot;, both &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Gaming Age&quot; recommended purchasing &quot;F-Zero X&quot; instead. &quot;Gamepro&quot; gave a positive review of the series, praising its music, controls, and variety of the game. &quot;Gamepro&quot;, in addition, compared the game to &quot;Extreme-G2&quot; and &quot;F-Zero X&quot;: &quot;While &quot;Extreme G-2&quot; may match &quot;Wipeout&quot; in content, it simply can&#x27;t compete when trying to match &quot;W64&quot;″s speed and &quot;F-Zero X&quot; isn&#x27;t even in the same league&quot;.

Opinion is divided on whether &quot;Wipeout 64&quot; simply merges the good points of the previous two games, or is different enough to be considered a sequel in its own right. Praised elements include &quot;prettier&quot; and &quot;grittier&quot; graphics compared to &quot;F-Zero X.&quot; Pop-up and a slow frame rate are repeatedly mentioned as problems, but only when the screen is split up to three or four times in multiplayer mode.

<text>Wipeout Fusion (stylized as WipEout FuSion) is a 2002 racing video game developed by Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. The fifth instalment in the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series, following &quot;Wipeout 3&quot; (1999), it was the first as well as the only original &quot;Wipeout&quot; title for PlayStation 2, with a port of &quot;Wipeout Pulse&quot; in 2009 being the only other &quot;Wipeout&quot; released on the platform. The game takes place in 2160 and revolves around players competing in the F9000 anti-gravity racing league. &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; received positive reviews upon release, with particular praise being directed at its techno soundtrack, but its graphics and track design received mixed responses from critics.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; is a racing game which is set in 2160 and revolves around players competing in the F9000 anti-gravity racing league. Players control anti-gravity ships owned by large racing corporations (collectively referred to as &quot;teams&quot;). Overall, the game contains 45 race tracks, 32 ship models, and 26 weapons. There are eight teams in &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;, each having a lead pilot and second pilot – players can choose which pilot and team they want to use before a race. Each ship has its characteristics; depending on the team selected, a ship will vary in terms of speed, acceleration, manoeuvrability, shield strength, weapon power, and mass.

The game has four race modes. Arcade mode involves a standard single race, in which the player must race against opponents and finish first to earn a gold medal; securing second or third place will reward the player with a silver or bronze medal, respectively. The AG League contains ten tournaments; each tournament has 3 to 7 races with sixteen competitors. Money is awarded at the end of each tournament as a result of time, damage, and skill bonuses. Players can use money to upgrade the appearance and performance of their ships. The other two race modes are &quot;Zone&quot; mode, which revolves around survival as the player&#x27;s ship automatically accelerates to extreme speeds, and time trial mode, where the player may record their best lap times.

In addition, the game features a variety of weapons which can be utilized to destroy other opponents or for self-defence. Offensive weapons include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive weapons range from deployable mines to energy shields. Every ship is also equipped with a standard energy shield which will protect the player from damage caused by collisions or weapon fire. If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in question will be eliminated from the race.

== Development and release ==
The game was developed by Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis prior to 2001). After the success of &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, the studio wanted to aim their next game at an &quot;older, savvier crowd&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;, chief designer Colin Berry said in a retrospective interview that he became disillusioned with the way the &quot;Wipeout&quot; franchise was trying to emulate games such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;F-Zero GX&quot;. &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; was announced to be published in North America by Bam! Entertainment in March 2002, after a delay in receiving the publishing licence by Sony&#x27;s American division. The game was ultimately released in Europe on 8 February 2002, and in North America later on 18 June.

== Reception ==
&quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; received generally favorable reviews upon release. It holds an average score of 83 percent from Metacritic based on aggregate of 21 reviews.

The graphics received mixed opinions from critics. Rick Sanchez of &quot;IGN&quot; felt disappointed with the game&#x27;s visuals, opining that its graphics had not changed since he had played it at E3 2001. Sanchez stated that the game looked like an &quot;early first generation PS2 game&quot;, and asserted that had it been released a year from writing his review, the graphics would not have looked as dated. Louis Bedigan from &quot;GameZone&quot; praised the game&#x27;s attention to detail, stating that the game&#x27;s visuals had improved by &quot;110%&quot; since &quot;Wipeout 3&quot; and thought a lot of time was put into &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;″s graphics, resulting in &quot;something truly extraordinary&quot;. John Kauderer of &quot;GameSpy&quot; praised the game&#x27;s key improvements over its predecessor – in particular its cutting edge graphic design, stating that it &quot;sets [the game] worlds apart from the tired side scrollers and kiddy characters that populated the 16-bit systems&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;GamePro&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s &quot;slickly renovated&quot; graphics. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s visuals, asserting that although the track designs appear more &quot;flamboyant&quot; over &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, the game &quot;keeps its visual flash to a minimum&quot;. Additionally, Davis also expressed disappointment in the lack of awe-inspiring tracks, as well as the game&#x27;s occasional slowdown and graphical pop-up issues. In contrast, Tom Bramwell from &quot;Eurogamer&quot; considered that &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;″s only improvement from its predecessors was its improved graphics engine.

Critics praised the game&#x27;s techno soundtrack and recognized that it was an important part of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series. Sanchez opined that the soundtrack from the previous &quot;Wipeout&quot; games—as well as &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;—are &quot;good enough&quot; to buy separately. Sanchez also commended the game&#x27;s sound effects and music, stating that both aspects are &quot;dead on for a member of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; family&quot;. Bedigan enjoyed the soundtrack, saying that every song was &quot;addictive&quot; and &quot;suits the game&#x27;s &#x27;extreme&#x27; feel&quot;. Kauderer thought that the game had an exceptional soundtrack, stating that since the use of licensed music in &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, the franchise had &quot;changed the face of the industry forever&quot;, although he opined that &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; had lost &quot;that cool edge&quot;. Davis praised the &quot;hard hitting&quot; techno soundtrack; saying that it was a type of music &quot;you&#x27;d want to listen to even when you weren&#x27;t playing the game&quot;. Bramwell, on the other hand, criticized the game&#x27;s choice of music, stating that the soundtrack feels &quot;like a practical joke&quot; and admitted to muting the music. A reviewer from &quot;Edge&quot; lauded the soundtrack, describing it as &quot;excellent, trance-inducing&quot;, but also said that the gameplay &quot;has failed to keep up with the times&quot;.

<text>Wipeout Pure (stylised as wipE′out pṳrE) is a 2005 racing video game developed by Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable. It was released as a launch title for the platform in North America and PAL territories, in March and September respectively. The sixth installment of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series, following &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot; (2002), the game takes place in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after the events of &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; (1996), and revolves around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league. 

Developed by Studio Liverpool, production of &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; started in August 2003 and lasted until early 2005. Throughout development, the team created entirely new user interfaces and other algorithms which sped up the development process in time for the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s North American launch. The game received positive reviews from critics upon release. Reviewers unanimously praised the graphics, track designs and general aesthetics, but some noticed occasional frame rate fluctuations.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; is a racing game which is set in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after the events of &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;, and revolves around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league. Players control anti-gravity ships which are owned by racing corporations (effectively referred to as &#x27;teams&#x27; in-game). There are a total of eight teams featured in the game, with one ship available for each. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship has variations in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each craft is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player&#x27;s ship collides or is hit by weapon fire. If the shield runs out, the player&#x27;s ship will explode and is consequently eliminated from the race. However, the player may replenish energy by absorbing weapon pick-ups.

In addition to shielding, each ship has air brakes which can be utilised for navigating through difficult corners at high speed. The game also features several weapons which can be used against opponents, although some weapons have defensive purposes. For example, an autopilot will give control of the player&#x27;s ship over to the computer for a short period of time, and shields can be used to protect the player&#x27;s ship from all damage, albeit temporarily. Offensive weapons include rockets, missiles, plasma bolts and mines. Game modes include a single race, tournament, time trial and an exclusive &quot;Zone&quot; mode, which revolves around survival as the player&#x27;s ship increasingly accelerates to extreme speeds. The game also features an online multiplayer mode in addition to downloadable content, which features new ships, tracks and music.

===Downloadable content===
&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; was the first PSP title to support downloadable content including extra vehicles, tracks, and artwork free of charge via the Internet. Packs of downloadable content were made available every month for six months. There were three main packs, in one form or another, in all regions where DLC support was made available: Gamma, Delta, and Classic. In addition, there were also a number of region-exclusive packs that was only available for a specific version. DLC packs are not cross-compatible. They were released on the &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; official site, which was eventually shut down, but have since been preserved through third-party websites.

===Region differences===
To compensate for the delay of the launch in Europe, both for the PSP and its games, Studio Liverpool added a few new features to the European version. &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; supports game sharing which allowed owners of the European version the ability to send the demo version over Wi-Fi to other PSP owners who do not own &quot;Pure&quot;. This gives said players the ability to have up to 8-player games with only one copy of the game (but limited to the demo tracks). Another feature added was the playable demo for &quot;Fired Up&quot; and a &quot;&quot; movie demo. The &quot;Fired Up&quot; demo also supported game sharing for multiplayer with up to 7 friends who didn&#x27;t own a copy of &quot;Pure&quot; or &quot;Fired Up&quot;, but only on the &quot;Junkyard&quot; and &quot;Arctic&quot; levels. Finally, the European release contains four exclusive tracks then-available via download. These are named the Omega League. Aside from the American, European, and Japanese versions, there are two more versions: a Korean version with downloadable content support but no available downloads, and an Asian version which includes no download feature. Also, there was a demo for the game, which came bundled with the UMD release of the 2005 film, &quot;Stealth&quot;.

==Development==
&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; was developed by Liverpudlian developer Studio Liverpool. Pre-production of the game began in August 2003 and full production occurred in October of that year, with only two staff members working on the game at that time. The team received development kits for the PlayStation Portable in August 2004; by this time the development team had grown to twenty people. Dave Burrows, one of the original two staff members who conceptualised the game, reflected in a retrospective &quot;post-mortem&quot; that the studio had to learn from their previous mistakes with their predecessor, &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;. Burrows cited that one of the principal difficulties the development team faced was that the team&#x27;s artists and designers were &quot;fighting almost all of the time&quot;; designers would first design a track for the game, then pass it over to the artists whilst the former were still making adjustments to it. Burrows also recalled that the developer&#x27;s editing kits required many hours worth of &quot;tweaking&quot;, which ultimately did not result in a smooth workflow.

During development, the team set out to make the game playable for testing as soon as possible. Burrows explained that Studio Liverpool were forced to create a user interface &quot;entirely from scratch&quot;, along with dynamics, artificial intelligence and core elements before testing could commence. Development of each of these aspects were split into six-week cycles; Burrows stated that instead of the team spending six weeks designing and perfecting all the weapons in-game, the team spent three days designing weapons individually rather than simultaneously. Burrows recalled that whilst developing &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;, Studio Liverpool found that half of their time was being &quot;soaked up&quot; by building a user interface for their editor. As the team knew that &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; would have to be shipped out in time for the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s release, the decision was made to create new plugins for their software, Autodesk Maya, in order to save time during development.

After creating custom plugins for the 3D computer graphics software, Burrows claimed that the team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions to be made for the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s Universal Media Disc. The game&#x27;s cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.

In order to showcase the PlayStation Portable&#x27;s capabilities, the team had to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content had the potential to bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team had to find a way to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.

==Reception==

&quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; received positive reviews upon release. It holds an aggregate score of 88% from Metacritic based on 53 reviews.

The graphics were the most praised aspect of the game. Ryan Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the visuals were &quot;gorgeous&quot; and breathtaking to look at, both in ship designs and details of the tracks. Davis noted that the game never remains at a &quot;solid&quot; 60 frames per second, which can cause occasional fluctuation. A reviewer of &quot;GamePro&quot; similarly praised the visuals as breathtaking, stating that the &quot;beautiful&quot; panoramic scenery defied the notion of usual graphics displayed on a handheld console. Ryan O&#x27;Donnell of &quot;IGN&quot; considered the graphics to be the strongest aspect of the game, saying that its courses, weapon detail and ship designs were &quot;beautiful&quot;, but he found that occasional framerate issues kept it from &quot;perfection&quot;. Daniel Chang of &quot;GameSpy&quot; opined that the visuals were &quot;well-crafted as any video game or feature film&quot;. John Davison of &quot;1UP&quot; stated that both the game&#x27;s presentation and graphics were stunning and &quot;absolutely beautiful&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Edge&quot; similarly praised the aesthetics as &quot;beautiful&quot; and dynamic. Andy Kelly of GamesRadar stated that the visuals were well-designed, although he noticed some frame rate drops.

Critics also viewed various aspects of the gameplay favourably. Davis said that the high-speed gameplay was &quot;incredibly engaging&quot; and artistic on both a visual and technical level. A reviewer of &quot;GamePro&quot; enjoyed the idea of using different ships in races and also praised the game&#x27;s online multiplayer, stating that it &quot;adds a whole new dynamic to the game&quot;. O&#x27;Donnell cited the developer&#x27;s intention of blending ultra-fast gameplay as &quot;clever&quot;. In addition, O&#x27;Donnell acknowledged that Studio Liverpool &quot;learned from their mistakes&quot; from the poor gameplay of its predecessor, &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;, and created what O&#x27;Donnell considered as &quot;the most polished futuristic racer to ever hit the market&quot;. Chang similarly opined that the previous installment was &quot;obtuse&quot; and did not present a positive experience to the &quot;Wipeout&quot; franchise, although he agreed that &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; resulted in becoming an &quot;extremely polished&quot; and playable futuristic racing game, further adding that the developers trimmed off elements that were considered ineffective in previous games. A reviewer of &quot;Edge&quot; praised the game&#x27;s different modes as dynamic and vicious, stating that the game delivers an &quot;absolute&quot; sense of control. Kelly considered the online multiplayer &quot;superbly executed&quot; and the large amount of weapons in the game well-designed.

During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack&quot;.

<text>Augustine Ukattah (August 28, 1918 – January 27, 1996) was a Nigerian teacher and politician.

==Early life==
Augustine Echewodor Ukattah was born at Ahaba-Oloko in the Ikwuano Local Government Area of Abia State, Nigeria, on August 28, 1918. Ukattah was the fourth son of the Ukattah Nkor Abajuo family and Ejighiato Nwamgbede Ukattah, both of Ahaba-Oloko. His father died when he was very young and he had to grow up under his uncle, Chief Mathew Ugoani. He attended Christ the King Primary School in Aba and St. Theresa&#x27;s School in Okigwe. After a brief spell as a Pupil Teacher, he entered the prestigious St. Charles Teacher Training College in Onitsha, in 1941. He qualified as a Higher Elementary Teacher in 1944 and passed the Senior Teachers&#x27; Examination in History in 1948.

==Career==
After he left St. Charles Teacher Training College in 1944, he was sent to Holy Cross School, Uturu – Isuikwuato, in 1946, as a Certificated Teacher, for his first teaching assignment. From 1946 to 1950, he was the Headmaster of St. Patrick&#x27;s School Ogudu-Asaa in Isuikwuato. In 1951, following his outstanding record at St. Patrick&#x27;s School, he was posted to head St. Bernard&#x27;s School, Okigwe. He was later sent to Umuahia, in 1952, as the headmaster of St. Michael&#x27;s Township School, known then for outstanding results in both academia and sports. He headed St. Michael&#x27;s Township School, from 1952 to 1959. Between 1960 and 1962, he became the Catholic Mission Inspector General of Education. In 1963, he became Assistant Superintendent of Schools, a position he held until the end of Nigeria Civil War. He retired from active service in 1973. 
While he was the headmaster of St. Michael&#x27;s Township School, he was also active in politics and became secretary of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons — the popular political party among Eastern Nigerians at the time. He was elected member of the Federal House of Representatives for Bende Division from 1954 to 1959 and then became a Senator in the upper house of the National Assembly representing Umuahia Province. In 1961, Chief Ukattah acted as Senate President of Nigeria, holding brief for Barrister, Dennis Osadebay. He was appointed leader of a high-powered Nigerian delegation to the Republic of Mexico via the United States in 1963 by then Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, when he, as leader of the delegation, was privileged to have addressed a joint session of the Senate and of the Deputies of the Republic of Mexico. On return, he authored a book titled; &quot;My Trip to Mexico&quot;. He also served for many years as a member of the Bende Native Authority, and Bende County Council. He was equally, first Chairman of the defunct Ikwuano County Council, now known as Ikwuano Local Government Area of Abia State, and for many years, President of both Ikwuano and Oloko Clan Unions.

==Later life and death==
In the late fifties, he sponsored the education of his youngest brother Ferdinand I. E. Ukattah in Great Britain, where he qualified as a barrister and solicitor in 1960 and was the first Ikwuano and Umuahia indigene to qualify as a lawyer and later, the Chief Judge of Imo and Abia States, of Nigeria.

In 1976 he received a Knighthood of the Order of St. Gregory, from Pope Paul VI. Also, in 1977, he became a Knight of St. Mulumba and until his death in 1996, he was the Grand Knight of the Order of St. Mulumba in Umuahia Catholic Diocese. In 1991, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace by the State Government.

<doc id="1301302" wikidata="Q4820439" url="?curid=1301302" title="Augmented assignment">
<text>Augmented assignment (or compound assignment) is the name given to certain 
assignment operators in certain programming languages (especially those derived from C). An augmented assignment is generally used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable. A simple example is codice_1 which is expanded to codice_2. Similar constructions are often available for various binary operators.

In general, in languages offering this feature, most operators that can take a variable as one of their arguments and return a result of the same type have an augmented assignment equivalent that assigns the result back to the variable in place, including arithmetic operators, bitshift operators, and bitwise operators.

==Discussion==
For example, the following statement or some variation of it can be found in many programs:

 x = x + 1

This means &quot;find the number stored in the variable , add 1 to it, and store the result of the addition in the variable .&quot; As simple as this seems, it may have an inefficiency, in that the location of variable has to be looked up twice if the compiler does not recognize that two parts of the expression are identical: might be a reference to some array element or other complexity. In comparison, here is the augmented assignment version:

 x += 1

With this version, there is no excuse for a compiler failing to generate code that looks up the location of variable just once, and modifies it in place, if of course the machine code supports such a sequence. For instance, if x is a simple variable, the machine code sequence might be something like
 Load x
 Add 1
 Store x
and the same code would be generated for both forms. But if there is a special op code, it might be
 MDM x,1
meaning &quot;Modify Memory&quot; by adding 1 to x, and an optimizing compiler would generate the same code for both forms. Some machine codes offer INC and DEC operations (to add or subtract one), others might allow constants other than one.

More generally, the form is
 x ?= expression
where the stands for some operator (not always ), and there may be no special op codes to help. There is still the possibility that if is a complicated entity the compiler will be encouraged to avoid duplication in accessing , and of course, if is a lengthy name, there will be less typing required. This last was the basis of the similar feature in the ALGOL compilers offered via the Burroughs B6700 systems, using the tilde symbol to stand for the variable being assigned to, so that
 LongName:=x + sqrt(LongName)*7;
would become
 LongName:=x + sqrt(~)*7;
and so forth. This is more general than just codice_3 Producing optimum code would remain the province of the compiler.

==Semantics==
In expression-oriented programming languages such as C, assignment and augmented assignment are expressions, which have a value. This allows their use in complex expressions. However, this can produce sequences of symbols that are difficult to read or understand, and worse, a mistype can easily produce a different sequence of gibberish that although accepted by the compiler does not produce desired results. In other languages, such as Python, assignment and augmented assignment are statements, not expressions, and thus cannot be used in complex expressions. For example, the following is valid C, but not valid Python:

a += b += c

As with assignment, in these languages augmented assignment is a form of right-associative assignment.

Unlike in C, the compound assignment expressions of C++ evaluate to an lvalue.
Being an lvalue allows it to be written on the left-hand-side of some other assignment statement:

int x = 11;
(x *= 2) += 3; // Sets x to 25
===Computed assignment locations===
In languages such as C, C++ and Python, an augmented assignment where the assignment location includes function calls, is mandated to only call the functions once. I.e in the statement:

my_array[f1()] += 1

The function codice_4 is &quot;mandated&quot; to only be called once. 

If a language implements augmented assignment by macro expansion to:

my_array[f1()] = my_array[f1()] + 1

Then codice_4 is called twice.

==By language==
===C descendants===
In C, C++, and C#, the assignment operator is codice_6, which is augmented as follows:
Each of these is called a &quot;compound assignment&quot; operator in said languages.

==Supporting languages==
The following list, though not complete or all-inclusive, lists some of the major programming languages that support augmented assignment operators.

<doc id="1301307" wikidata="Q7774450" url="?curid=1301307" title="The Whistling Gypsy">
<text>&quot;The Whistling Gypsy&quot;, sometimes known simply as &quot;The Gypsy Rover&quot;, is a well-known ballad composed and copyrighted by Dublin songwriter Leo Maguire in the 1950s.
There are a number of similar traditional songs about a well-off woman&#x27;s encounter with Gypsies, dating back at least as far as the early 19th century, known as &quot;The Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot;, &quot;The Raggle Taggle Gypsies&quot;, &quot;The Gypsy Laddie&quot;, &quot;Nine Yellow Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Gypsie Davie&quot; and &quot;Black Jack Davie&quot; (Roud #1, Child 200). The story-line usually revolves around a woman leaving her home and her &quot;wedded lord&quot; to run off with one or more Gypsies, to be pursued by her husband. Dorothy Scarborough&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;A Song Catcher In Southern Mountains: American Folk Songs of British Ancestry&quot; includes a lullaby called &quot;Gypsy Davy&quot;, which Scarborough collected from two Virginia women who had learned the song from their respective grandmothers who in turn had learned it in Ireland. Scarborough&#x27;s &quot;Gypsy Davy&quot; has a similar construction to Maguire&#x27;s song, both in some of the lyrics in the verses and in the &quot;ah dee do&quot; chorus that does not appear in the other aforementioned Gypsy-themed songs. However, in Maguire&#x27;s song the lady is pursued by her father, and when he catches the pair the &quot;Gypsy&quot; reveals himself to be the &quot;lord of these lands all over&quot;.

The song was first recorded by Joe Lynch in Dublin on the Glenside label, which had been set up by Martin Walton in 1952. It was popularised throughout the country by airplay on the Walton&#x27;s Programme on Radio Éireann, also established by Walton in that year. Another early recording was by Rose Brennan, for His Master&#x27;s Voice in London, in October 1953. In 1954 Rose Brennan&#x27;s cover was awarded third place by the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; for the best recording of the year. Later that year it was selected as the title tune for the film &quot;The Black Knight&quot;, starring Alan Ladd and Patricia Medina. For this purpose it was given new lyrics by Maguire and Elton Hayes, who sang it in the film.

Since then it has been recorded by numerous artists, including The Corries (who were at that time known as the Corrie Folk Trio), Carmel Quinn, The Clancy Brothers, The Kingston Trio, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The Highwaymen (who had a minor hit single with the song), The Limeliters, The Seekers, Foster &amp; Allen and The Wiggles.

<text>Bash at the Beach was a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). It was the company&#x27;s PPV for the month of July, held from 1994–2000. As the title implied, the show centered on a beach theme.

Due to its beach theme, the stage where wrestlers made their entrances was decorated with beach related items, such as surfboards and sand. The beach theme lended to its summer scheduling of July. The theme was also reflected in the places where WCW chose to hold the event; all of the shows emanated from cities in either Florida or California, two U.S. states renowned for their warm weather. It was WCW&#x27;s response to the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s SummerSlam.

==History==
In 1992 and 1993, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) held a beach-themed pay-per-view show known as Beach Blast, which was the forerunner to Bash at the Beach. The 1992 show was held in June, however, as the company elected instead to reserve July for its flagship summertime extravaganza, The Great American Bash. Along with Slamboree, Starrcade, SuperBrawl, The Great American Bash, and Halloween Havoc, Bash at the Beach was booked to be one of WCW&#x27;s flagship events.

Bash at the Beach marked three major turning points during Hulk Hogan&#x27;s career. During 1994 Hogan made his WCW in-ring debut defeating Ric Flair to win his first WCW World Heavyweight Championship. During the 1996 event, Hogan turned heel, as he was revealed to be the third member for the New World Order, leading to WCW overtaking the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) for nearly two years as the top professional wrestling company in the world. The 2000 event was Hogan&#x27;s final appearance for the company, wherein he defeated Jeff Jarrett for the WCW Championship, but was soon thereafter stripped of the title and was fired on-air by Vince Russo in events which led to litigation between Hogan and WCW, and a series of events whose authenticity are to this day under question.

To promote the 1995 event, Hogan, Randy Savage, Ric Flair, Big Van Vader, and Kevin Sullivan guest starred on season 6 episode 15 of &quot;Baywatch&quot;, also titled &quot;Bash at the Beach&quot;.

==Legacy==
In March 2001, the WWF acquired WCW and the majority of its assets, which included all of its championships and the intellectual properties for all of their PPVs; the following year, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Although WWE revived some of WCW&#x27;s old PPVs over the years, such as The Great American Bash, Bash at the Beach was never one that was reused by WWE. However, in 2014, all of WCW&#x27;s Bash at the Beach pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network streaming service.

WWE left the &quot;Bash at the Beach&quot; trademark to expire in 2004/2005 after their purchase of WCW. Cody Rhodes, executive vice president for All Elite Wrestling (AEW), a promotion that was founded in January 2019, trademarked the name in early 2019 for use in the company as it was created by his father, Dusty Rhodes. AEW Bash at the Beach, which was held as a two-part special of AEW&#x27;s flagship program, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, took place on January 15, 2020 and continued with Chris Jericho&#x27;s Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Wrestling Rager at Sea on January 22. In August of that year, Cody&#x27;s trademark was officially denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. By November of that year, a settlement was reached between Cody Rhodes and WWE in which Cody gained the &quot;Cody Rhodes&quot; trademark, which WWE had held onto after his run in that company, in exchange for WWE gaining the WCW event name trademarks that Cody had claimed, including &quot;Bash at the Beach&quot;.

<doc id="1301311" wikidata="Q1147204" url="?curid=1301311" title="Coccidia">
<text>Coccidia (Coccidiasina) are a subclass of microscopic, spore-forming, single-celled obligate intracellular parasites belonging to the apicomplexan class Conoidasida. 
As obligate intracellular parasites, they must live and reproduce within an animal cell. Coccidian parasites infect the intestinal tracts of animals, and are the largest group of apicomplexan protozoa.

Infection with these parasites is known as coccidiosis. Coccidia can infect all mammals, some birds, some fish, some reptiles, and some amphibians. Most species of coccidia are species-specific in their host. An exception is &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, which can infect all mammals, although it can only undergo sexual reproduction in cats. Depending on the species of coccidia, infection can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and nervous system effects and changes to behavior, and may lead to death. Healthy adults may recover without medication—but those who are immunocompromised or young almost certainly require medication to prevent death. Humans generally become infected by eating under-cooked meat, but can contract infection with &quot;T. gondii&quot; by poor hygiene when handling cat waste.

==Taxonomy==

The class is divided into four orders, which are distinguished by the presence or absence of various asexual and sexual stages:

*Order Agamococcidiorida Levine-1979
*Order Eucoccidiorida Léger &amp; Duboscq-1910
*Order Ixorheorida Levine-1984
*Order Protococcidiorida Kheisin-1956

The order Eucoccidiorida is divided into two suborders. These two groups differ in their sexual development: syzygy for Adeleorina and independent gametes for Eimeriorina.

The first suborder, Adeleorina, comprises coccidia of invertebrates and the coccidia that alternate between blood-sucking invertebrates and various vertebrates; this group includes &quot;Haemogregarina&quot; and &quot;Hepatozoon&quot;. There are seven families in this suborder.

The second suborder, Eimeriorina, comprises a variety of coccidia, many of which form cysts. A number of genera, including &quot;Toxoplasma&quot; and &quot;Sarcocystis&quot;, infect vertebrates.

==Coccidiosis==

===Transmission===
Infected animals spread spores called oocysts in their stool. The oocysts mature, called sporulation. When another animal passes over the location where the feces were deposited, it may pick up the spores, which it then ingests when grooming itself. Mice may ingest the spores and become infected. When another animal eats the mouse, it becomes infected.

Some species of coccidia are transmissible to humans, including toxoplasma and cryptosporidium.

===Infection===
Inside the host, the sporulated oocyst opens, and eight sporozoites are released. Each one finds a home in an intestinal cell and starts the process of reproduction. These offspring are called merozoites. When the cell is stuffed full of merozoites, it bursts open, and each merozoite finds its own intestinal cell to continue the cycle.

===Symptoms of infection===
As the infection continues, millions of intestinal cells may become infected. As they break open, they produce a bloody, watery diarrhea. This can cause dehydration, and can lead to death in young or small pets. Coccidian infections display symptoms mainly from the digestive tract including diarrhea, inflammation, intestinal pain or damage, vomiting, and irregular nutrition. These can lead to weight loss or reduced growth development, anemia, exhaustion, and even death in severe cases.

===Diagnosis and treatment===
Coccidiosis can be diagnosed by finding oocysts in fecal smears. In early stages of the disease, there may be very few oocysts being shed, and a negative test does not rule out the disease.

Coccidiosis is most commonly treated through the administration of coccidiostats, a group of medications that stop coccidia from reproducing. In dogs and cats, the most commonly administered coccidiostat is sulfa-based antibiotics. Once reproduction stops, the animal can usually recover on its own, a process that can take a few weeks, depending on the severity of the infection and the strength of the animal&#x27;s immune system.

<doc id="1301314" wikidata="Q3365382" url="?curid=1301314" title="Ed McCurdy">
<text>Edward Potts McCurdy (January 11, 1919 – March 23, 2000) was an American folk singer and songwriter. His most well-known song was the anti-war &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot;, written in 1950.

==Career==

Born to a farming family in Willow Hill, Pennsylvania, McCurdy left home at 18 to pursue a singing career. He first found success in 1938 as a singer and disc jockey at a gospel radio station in Oklahoma. By the early 1940s, McCurdy had become a popular singer of romantic songs in nightclubs across North America, until vaudeville dancer Sally Rand caught his act, hired him to join her show, put him in a tuxedo, and had him sing his romantic songs to her on stage while pushing her on her swing.

He stayed in vaudeville for several years as a singer and straight man to comedian (Fat) Jack E. Leonard, before moving in 1948, with his Canadian dancer wife and family, to Vancouver where he hosted his own radio show for CBC Radio. With the success of this show, the CBC transferred him to the flagship national station in Toronto where he starred in a morning children&#x27;s show and an adult evening show. During his Canadian radio period, he developed friendships with the guests on his show, such as Pete Seeger, Lena Horne, Josh White, Oscar Peterson, and Oscar Brand. He developed a love for folk music and released his first folk album in 1949.

After achieving success with his folk show at New York&#x27;s Village Vanguard in 1950, McCurdy and his family moved to New York City, from where he went on to become one of the world&#x27;s best-known folk singers. He also became the &quot;L&amp;M Cigarette Man&quot; on television, was an emcee for the &quot;George Gobel Show&quot; (national TV), and by 1956, was star of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Freddie The Fireman&quot;.

He recorded many albums in the 1950s and 1960s for Elektra Records and Tradition Records, performed several times at the Newport Folk Festival, and was a well-known folk music artist throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, developing friendships with the younger folk set of Odetta, Bob Gibson, Erik Darling, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, and Josh White Jr.

His widely covered anti-war song, &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot;, has been recorded in seventy-six languages (including covers by The Weavers in 1960, the Chad Mitchell Trio in 1962, Simon &amp; Garfunkel in 1964, Cornelis Vreeswijk in 1964 (in Swedish), Hannes Wader in 1979 (in German), Johnny Cash in 2003, Garth Brooks in 2005, Serena Ryder in 2006, and Charles Lloyd in 2016). The melody is included in Francesco de Gregori&#x27;s &quot;Via della poverta&quot;.

In November 1989, as Tom Brokaw stood on top of the Berlin Wall, he directed his NBC-TV cameras towards the school children on the East German side of the Berlin Wall, to show the children singing &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot; en masse as the wall was being dismantled.

His collection of risqué Elizabethan folk songs in a three-part series of albums titled &quot;When Dalliance was in Flower (and Maidens Lost Their Heads)&quot;, became a favorite record series on college campuses. The actor Alan Arkin played with him on these recordings. His single &quot;Miracle of the Wheat&quot; released on Kapp Records in 1956 became a Christmas Tradition on Cincinnati Radio, played annually on WKRC-AM by broadcaster Stan Matlock.

By the late 1960s, McCurdy was forced to retire with health problems. In 1980, two of his compositions, &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot;, as recorded by his old friend Josh White Jr., became the official theme songs for the Peace Corps and VISTA, respectively.

In the mid 1980s, he and his wife Beryl moved to Nova Scotia, where he enjoyed a second career as a character actor on Canadian television.
He was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award September 26, 1992 for &quot;Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream&quot;.

<text>Tegan Jovanka is a fictional character played by Janet Fielding in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. An Australian airline stewardess and a native of Brisbane who was a companion of the Fourth and Fifth Doctors, she was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1984. Tegan appeared in 20 stories (65 episodes).

According to producer John Nathan-Turner, when he was thinking of a name for the character, it was either going to be Tegan, after his partner&#x27;s niece in Australia, or Jovanka, after Jovanka Broz, the widow of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, so he wrote both down on a piece of paper. Script editor Christopher H. Bidmead mistakenly believed that Jovanka was the character&#x27;s last name rather than an alternative, and so christened her &quot;Tegan Jovanka&quot;.

==Character history==
Tegan first appears in the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s last serial, &quot;Logopolis&quot;. En route to Heathrow Airport to start her new job as a stewardess with Air Australia, her aunt Vanessa&#x27;s vehicle (in which she is riding) suffers a flat tyre. Tegan enters a roadside police box to seek help, not knowing that it is actually the Doctor&#x27;s disguised TARDIS. She is present when the Fourth Doctor falls from the Pharos Project radio telescope and regenerates into his fifth incarnation, and continues to journey with the Doctor and his other companions. She travels with the Doctor initially because her aunt was killed by the Master, although she still wants to get to Heathrow Airport to start her new job, as soon as the Doctor can get her there.

Tegan is stubborn, loud, and direct, with a no-nonsense manner and not afraid to speak her mind (in &quot;Earthshock&quot; she describes herself as &quot;just a mouth on legs&quot;). Her time in the TARDIS coincides with that of Adric, Nyssa, Turlough and Kamelion. While she often bickers with them (particularly with Adric) as well as with the Doctor, her strength of character keeps them together and her loyalty and affection to her crewmates is unquestionable. She is close to Nyssa, and is especially saddened at her leaving. She is initially very suspicious of Turlough, frequently referring to him as a &quot;brat&quot; at first, though they gradually become friends. The Doctor notes that she is a good coordinator, and often encourages her with the words, &quot;Brave heart, Tegan.&quot; She is apparently able to speak at least one Indigenous Australian language fluently, and shows an ability to use firearms.

Despite her strong front, however, her adventures with the Doctor, both thrilling and terrifying, eventually take a psychological toll. She is deeply upset by the death of Adric in &quot;Earthshock&quot;. After being left behind in Heathrow due to a misunderstanding at the end of &quot;Time-Flight&quot;, she returns to the TARDIS in the next adventure &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot;, which is set about a year later in Earth time (Although the Doctor and Nyssa have been depicted having several adventures in that time frame in the audio adventures). During that period, Tegan had worked as a stewardess, but had been subsequently fired. Soon after, she is once again possessed by the alien intelligence known as the Mara. Eventually, the carnage surrounding the events of &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; proves too much and she bids an emotional good-bye to both the Doctor and Turlough in 1984 London.

Tegan Jovanka is one of the few companions of the classic series to be seen to have an extended family. She had an Australian aunt in the UK named Vanessa (Dolore Whiteman). In Logopolis it is said that Tegan&#x27;s father owned an Australian farm. Tegan&#x27;s English maternal grandfather Andrew Verney (Frederick Hall) was a local historian who had a cottage in the English village of Little Hodcombe in &quot;The Awakening&quot;, and her cousin Colin Frazer (Alastair Cumming) lived in Brisbane but was terrorised by Omega whilst back-packing in Amsterdam during &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot;.

Tegan appeared in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; celebrating the BBC Centenary, alongside the returning former companion Ace and the Thirteenth Doctor portrayed by Jodie Whittaker in her final outing as The Doctor.

==Other mentions==
An illusory image of Tegan is seen during the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration into the Sixth in &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984).

In &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985), The Sixth Doctor calls his companion Peri &#x27;Tegan&#x27;, which leads into Peri telling the Doctor that he has called her &#x27;Tegan&#x27; amongst many other names.

In the 2007 &quot;Children in Need&quot; special episode &quot;Time Crash&quot;, the Tenth Doctor asks his fifth incarnation if he is still travelling with Tegan in his own relative timeline.

In &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; two-parter &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; (2010), Tegan is mentioned as having campaigned for the rights of Indigenous Australians.

In &quot;The Crimson Horror&quot; (2013), the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara Oswald that he spent a long time trying to get a &quot;gobby Australian&quot; to Heathrow Airports. A scream is then heard, and he says &quot;Brave heart, Clara.&quot;

A 2020 short published to the official Doctor Who YouTube channel and titled &quot;Farewell, Sarah Jane&quot;, written by former Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies, revealed that Tegan was in a relationship with fellow traveller Nyssa.

==Other appearances==
Fielding reprised the role in a 1985 sketch (&quot;A Fix with Sontarans&quot;) for the children&#x27;s show &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; alongside Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor. This sketch suggests Tegan returns to the life of a flight attendant and has also frosted her hair blonde, before being accidentally returned to the TARDIS by the Sixth Doctor.

Tegan&#x27;s life after journeying with the Doctor is investigated in the Big Finish Productions 2006 audio drama &quot;The Gathering&quot;. Although she finds it difficult to enter into relationships and is suffering from a terminal illness, she tells the Doctor that she has no regrets about her time with him, and now appreciates her life to the full.

The spin-off fiction suggests that she was briefly married to pop star Johnny Chester (also known as Johnny Chess), the son of the First Doctor&#x27;s companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. In the spin-off short story &quot;Good Companions&quot; by Peter Anghelides Tegan has suffered a nervous breakdown and convinced herself that her time with the Doctor was a delusion.

In the promotional video for the season 19 Blu-ray box set, Fielding reprised her role as Tegan, this time appearing as the owner and Chief Executive Officer of &quot;Jovanka Airlines&quot;, parodying flight take off instructions for passengers once they have boarded, with Peter Davison and Sarah Sutton playing the passengers.

<text>Mazyr or Mozyr (, ; , ; ; ) is a city in Gomel Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Mazyr District. It is situated on the Pripyat River about east of Pinsk and northwest of Chernobyl in Ukraine. As of 2024, it has a population of 105,152.

Mazyr is known as a center of oil refining, salt extraction, machine building, and food processing in Belarus. It is home to one of the largest oil refineries in Belarus, pumping out 18 million metric tons per year, and is served by a tram line. The Druzhba pipeline carries crude oil from Russia, splitting in two at Mazyr. One pipeline branch is directed into Poland and the other one to Ukraine.

==History==
The city was mentioned in 1155.

It was a county seat in the Mińsk Voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until the Partitions of Poland. In the 18th century, Baroque monasteries and churches of Cistercian monks and nuns were established. At various times, the 2nd and 3rd Lithuanian Vanguard Regiments were stationed there.

During the Partitions of Poland, the city was annexed by Russia, within which it was administratively part of the Minsk Governorate. The city was subjected to Russification policies. In the 19th century both Cistercian monasteries were closed down. The women&#x27;s convent was converted into an Orthodox monastery, while the men&#x27;s monastery was planned to be demolished, but the plan was abandoned as it served as a shelter for Jews after a city fire. Two annual fairs were held in the city in the late 19th century. During the Polish–Soviet War, on March 4, 1920, the town was captured by the Poles, but later on it fell to the Soviets.

During World War II, the German occupiers operated a Nazi prison in the town.

The city has suffered radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl disaster.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cistercian churches were restored to the Catholics.

==Climate==
==Jewish community== 
Jews were first mentioned in chronicles in the second half of the 17th century. It is known that there were three synagogues in the city as of 1856. R. Kugel, a prominent Jewish community figure, had been the chief Rabbi of Mazyr since 1861. He was also the head of the local Jewish literacy school.

During this period Jews were mostly engaged in craftsmanship and trading. Part of Mazyr&#x27;s industry, the match factory and the wood sawing factory were owned by Jews.

There were eight active synagogues, a yeshiva, Jewish school and Talmud-Torah school in the wake of the 20th century. All of the facilities had been closed down by 1939.

Thousands of Jews were executed by German troops in the local ghetto during World War II. After the mass execution, almost no Jews remained in the city, whereas before the war 30% of the population within the city was Jewish. On August 31, 1941, hundreds of Jews gathered inside a house at Malo-Pushkin street. They poured kerosene on the building walls and set it alight, while the people huddled inside. The mass suicide was an attempt to escape execution by the Germans. The incident is known as the &quot;Belarusian Masada&quot;.

After the war some Jews returned to Mazyr. Although they refused to take back the partially-destroyed synagogue building, an official Jewish community was registered in 1946. A few years later, authorities denied the organization&#x27;s right to exist. The community organization was re-established officially in 1989, when a revival began in the city. A synagogue and a Jewish culture club were opened.

==Transport==

Mazyr has a tram service, which commenced operation on 1 August 1988. The line starts at the tram depot and terminates at the oil refinery, with four turning loops located along the route. It is designed to server Mazyr Oil Refinery (MNPZ) and is owned by the refinery. Services on the tram line are coordinated with shifts at the refinery; service throughout the day is every 25-95 minutes while during the peaks it is 3-12 minutes, though those services pass suburban stops without stopping. Most passengers are workers, though it also serves residents living near the line. The total length of the line is 20.3 km, with a full trip time of 40 minutes. The line has a high-speed layout, with radius of minimum 400 meters. There were plans for a second tram line, but this has not come to fruition. The rolling stock is mainly 71-605 and its derivative vehicles. VD Bolshoi Bokov airfield is located south of Mazyr and was used by Russian military aircraft during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>Carmen Jovet Esteves (born June 9, 1944) is a journalist and the first female news anchor in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Carmen Jovet Esteves, daughter of Manolín Jovet-Viruet and Doña Carmen &quot;Cuca&quot; Esteves, was born and raised in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico into a family where having a good education was important. She was considered a gifted child and quickly advanced in school. She started making speeches when she was 6 years old, first appeared on radio at the age of 7 with radio personality Pedro Ojeda on WPRA-AM in Mayagüez, and by time she was 12, she was a competent orator. She enjoyed participating in her school&#x27;s extracurricular activities. She was a member of various academic groups including the school&#x27;s drama club.

Jovet graduated from high school when she was 14 years old and enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico on a scholarship. When she was 17, she graduated with honors with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Sciences.

==Career==
Jovet&#x27;s first job was at &quot;WIPR&quot; Channel 6, where she hosted a program called &quot;Club Seis&quot; and later a program called &quot;Fabrica del Arte&quot;. In 1968, Jovet caught the attention of Leopoldo Santiago Lavandero, who invited her to join his production &quot;&quot;Panorama Mundial&quot; as a reporter, at the same Channel. A few years later she was offered the position of anchor for &quot;El Once en la Noticias&quot;&quot; at Channel 11 and thus became the first Puerto Rican woman news anchor on the island.

In 1975, Jovet founded her own independent production company and became the host of a show which investigated and interviewed public figures. Among those interviewed was the President of Venezuela Carlos Andrés Pérez. She also covered the arrest of Puerto Rican actress Lydia Echevarría.

Jovet hosted the TV show &quot;Sabado en Grande&quot; (Big Saturday) for a short time before joining Channel 2, where she hosted her own show, &quot;Carmen Jovet, Controversial&quot;, a talk show in which the public was encouraged to participate.

In the 1980s, she hosted a daily television broadcast that followed the adjournment of the day&#x27;s Puerto Rico Senate public hearing about the controversial Cerro Maravilla incidents on July 25, 1978. By 1981 she was the news director of WKBM, Channel 11. In 1989 she was noted by the New York Times as being one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most popular television personalities, a sentiment echoed by the New York Daily News in 1991.

In 1987, The Governor of Puerto Rico Rafael Hernández Colón, named Jovet as the official coordinator in charge of the official state visit of the King and Queen of Spain. In 1992, she was named the Director of Communications of the Commission in charge of the 5th Centennial Celebration of the encounter of the Two Worlds. She was the host of a program called &quot;Ahora Podemos Hablar&quot;, transmitted through Telemundo TV.

==Recognitions==
Among the many recognitions bestowed upon her are:
*The title of &quot;Lady Television&quot; by the Superior Council of Art;
*The Order of Duarte Horsemen, Sanchez and Mella by the President of the Dominican Republic Joaquín Balaguer;
*The José de Diego Award from the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture
*&quot;Doctorate &quot;Honoris Causa&quot;&quot; in Criminal Justice from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.

However, perhaps her greatest recognition is the fact that she&#x27;s known universally in Puerto Rico as La Mujer Noticia.

==Currently==
Carmen Jovet is currently active as a radio commentator, hosting her own radio talk/news show on NotiUno radio network - 630AM from 10:00 AM until noon. Besides her career as a journalist, Jovet was an occasional actress and had a small role in the 1989 film &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; starring Brooke Shields.

In the aftermath of the January 12, 2010 earthquake that devastated Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Puerto Rico, then-Governor Luis Fortuño asked her to coordinate a telethon to benefit the Red Cross&#x27;s Haitian relief efforts. The telethon raised over $3.3 million. In preparation for the telethon, Jovet, along with Puerto Rico Secretary of State and Lieutenant Governor Kenneth McClintock, travelled to Haiti and met and interviewed then-President René Préval, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and First Lady Elisabeth Delatour Préval.

She held a one-hour weekly interview program, &quot;Ahora Podemos Hablar&quot;, on WIPR-TV, Puerto Rico&#x27;s public television station, on Sunday prime time. After the death of Carlos Mamery late in 2014, Jovet signed with WAPA-America to substitute him on their show, &quot;Lo Sé Todo&quot;, where she is now a political analyst.

<doc id="1301363" wikidata="Q3517915" url="?curid=1301363" title="Panhandle hook">
<text>A panhandle hook (also called a pan handle hook or Texas hooker) is a relatively infrequent winter storm system whose cyclogenesis occurs in the South to southwestern United States from the late fall through winter and into the early spring months. They trek to the northeast on a path towards the Great Lakes region, as the southwesterly jet streams are most prevalent, usually affecting the Midwestern United States and Eastern Canada. Panhandle hooks account for some of the most memorable and deadly blizzards and snowstorms in North America. The name is derived from the region of surface cyclogenesis in the Texas panhandle and Oklahoma panhandle regions. In some winters, there are no panhandle hook storms; in others, there are several.

==Formation==

A panhandle hook storm has its origins as a strong shortwave low pressure system which traverses the base of a long-wave low pressure trough while geographically coincident with the southwestern United States. Such systems ubiquitously develop a surface low-pressure system in the northwestern Texas and western Oklahoma area (as an eddy effect interaction of the topography of the Rocky Mountains in relation to the jet stream) with associated warm front and cold front, with attending snow to the northwest of the low and severe thunderstorms to the southeast -- the &quot;hook&quot; refers to the left-ward east to northeast jog in the track of the surface low as it is plotted on a weather analysis chart.

If the associated jet stream is stronger than normal and there is colder than normal air in place in central Canada to provide a greater than normal temperature contrast with Gulf of Mexico moisture drawn northward by the developing panhandle low, surface cyclogenesis can be particularly energetic and cause a great swath of heavy snow to develop and blanket a large portion of the American Great Plains and upper-midwestern states in conjunction with very strong winds, the combination of which exceeds blizzard criteria. Over the Great Lakes, the interaction of these storms with the lakes can amplify windspeeds causing extreme heavy sometimes localized snowfall, thundersnow and often shoreline erosion. Initially pleasant weather ahead of the northeast-bound storm can lull the unwary into dressing lightly and then being surprised by heavy snow accompanied by howling easterly and northerly winds as the low traverses south to east of their location.

== Historic panhandle hooks ==
Famous storms that were panhandle hooks are the Armistice Day Blizzard of November 11, 1940, and the storm which sank the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; on November 10, 1975.

<text>The Flying Yankee is a diesel-electric streamliner built in 1935 for the Boston and Maine Railroad by Budd Company and with mechanical and electrical equipment from Electro-Motive Corporation. It was the third streamliner train in North America. That train ceased passenger service in 1957 and is stored at the Conway Scenic Railroad in New Hampshire. It was owned by the state of New Hampshire, until it was purchased by the Flying Yankee Association after being selected by the state of New Hampshire to receive ownership of the diesel streamliner.

==History==
Prior to 1935, the name &quot;Flying Yankee&quot; referred to a passenger train that ran between Bangor, Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts, at least back to 1891. The train was hauled by an early 4-6-2 steam locomotive; cars were standard heavyweight construction.

The new &quot;Flying Yankee&quot; in the 1930s was a lightweight train constructed with welded stainless steel using Budd&#x27;s patented process. The engine was an 8-cylinder Winton 201-A diesel, driving a generator; the lead truck was equipped with traction motors. It was fitted with air conditioning in all cars. No dining car was provided; instead, meals were prepared in a galley and served to passengers in trays that clipped to the back of the seat in front.

It was the third streamliner in service after the Union Pacific&#x27;s M-10000 and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot;. The &quot;Flying Yankee&quot; was a virtual clone of the latter, except that it dispensed with the baggage/mail space to seat 142 in three articulated cars.

The train was delivered in February 1935, and toured the BM-MEC railroad system before entering service on April 1. The daily route served began in Portland, then to Boston, followed by a return to Portland and continuing to Bangor, Maine, returning through Portland to Boston and finally returning to Portland late in the day, a distance of per day. This schedule was kept six days a week; the trainset spent Sundays undergoing maintenance. The train proved extremely successful, attracting new ridership and earning a profit for its owners.

Later on, as newer equipment replaced it on one route, it would be switched to other routes, bearing the names &quot;Cheshire&quot;, &quot;Minute Man&quot;, &quot;Mountaineer&quot;, and &quot;Business Man&quot;.

As railroad passenger ridership declined in the 1950s, the &quot;Yankee&quot; was also getting old, and thus the trainset, as &quot;The Minuteman&quot;, was retired, running its last on May 7, 1957. 

Most of the train&#x27;s route is currently operated by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Downeaster&quot;, which runs as far north as Brunswick, Maine.

== Current location ==
The railroad donated the trainset to the Edaville Railroad tourist/museum operation in Carver, Massachusetts, in 1957. The train remained on static display there until it was moved in 1993 to Glen, New Hampshire, after being purchased by Bob Morrell, then-owner of Story Land.

In 1997, the train was moved to the Concord and Claremont Railroad shops in Claremont, New Hampshire, for a restoration after it was purchased by the state of New Hampshire. By 2004, the major structural restoration had been completed, and detailed restoration of components is ongoing with the goal of restoring the train completely to running condition. The train was moved on August 10, 2005, to the Hobo Railroad in Lincoln, New Hampshire.

Plans to move it to Concord, New Hampshire, site of a former Boston and Maine railyard, fell through in 2017. In November 2023, the state of New Hampshire put the equipment up for sale, with a focus on &quot;the relocation and encouraged restoration&quot; of the trainset. In April 2024, the trainset was sold to the Flying Yankee Association, who hopes to restore and operate the set in the Mount Washington Valley, with a possibility of running it on the Conway Scenic Railroad. It was moved to Conway on July 30, 2024, were it is currently undergoing restoration.

<doc id="1301373" wikidata="Q219586" url="?curid=1301373" title="A-League Men">
<text>A-League Men (currently known as the [[Isuzu]] UTE A-League for sponsorship reasons) is the highest-level professional men&#x27;s soccer league in Australia and New Zealand. At the top of the Australian league system, it is the country&#x27;s premier men&#x27;s competition for the sport. A-League Men was established in 2004 as the A-League by the Australian Soccer Association (ASA) as a successor to the National Soccer League (NSL) and competition commenced in August 2005. 

Administered by the Australian Professional Leagues (APL), it is contested by thirteen teams; eleven based in Australia with two based in New Zealand. Seasons run from October to May and include a 27-round regular season followed by a finals series playoff involving the six highest-placed teams, culminating in a grand final match. The winner of the regular season tournament is dubbed the &#x27;Premier&#x27; while the winner of the grand final is the season&#x27;s &quot;Champion&quot;. This differs from other football codes in Australia, where &quot;premier&quot; refers to the winner of the grand final and the winner of the regular season is the &#x27;minor premier&#x27;.

Most successful clubs for the season are granted qualification into the Asian continental club competitions, the AFC Champions League Elite and the AFC Champions League Two. In 2014, the Western Sydney Wanderers became the first and only winning Australian club of the AFC Champions League. Like in the United States&#x27; MLS, as well as other professional sports leagues in Australia, A-League Men does not practice relegation and promotion and furthermore institutes a salary cap; again similar to the MLS. The men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth are furthermore brought together under the unified A-Leagues banner.

==History==
===Background===
A national round-robin tournament existed in various forms prior to the formation of the A-League, with the most notable being the National Soccer League (NSL). The formation of the NSL came after Australia&#x27;s qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which led to discussion of a national league, with 14 teams eventually chosen to participate in the inaugural season of the NSL in 1977.

Under the guidance of the then-governing body, the Australian Soccer Federation (later Soccer Australia), the NSL flourished through the 1980s and early 1990s but then fell into decline with the increasing departure of Australian players to overseas leagues, a disastrous television deal with the Seven Network and the resulting lack of sponsorship. Few clubs continued to grow with Sydney Olympic, Perth Glory, and the newly established Adelaide United the exception in a dying league.

In April 2003, the Australian Federal Government initiated the Independent Soccer Review Committee to investigate the governance and management of the sport in Australia, including that of the NSL. In December 2003, a Crawford Report found that the NSL was financially unviable, and in response the chairman of the sport&#x27;s new governing body, Frank Lowy of the Football Federation Australia, announced a task force would be formed to create a new national competition a successor to the NSL which had dissolved at the conclusion of the 2003–04 season after 27 years of operation.

===Foundations===
The A-League was announced in April 2004, succeeding the NSL. Eight teams would be part of the new national competition, with one team from each city of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Newcastle, plus a New Zealand team and one from a remaining expressions of interest from either Melbourne or Sydney. The competition start date was set for August 2005.

By June, 20 submissions had been received and a month later 12 consortiums sent in their final bids for the eight spots. Three bids were received from Melbourne, two each from Sydney and Brisbane, one from each of the remaining preferred cities and a bid from the New South Wales Central Coast city of Gosford. Over the next three months, each bid was reviewed and on 1 November 2004, the eight successful bidders and the major sponsor were revealed, for what would be known as the &#x27;Hyundai A-League&#x27;, with the Hyundai Motor Company unveiled as the official naming rights sponsor for the league.

The eight founding teams were Adelaide United, the Central Coast Mariners, the Melbourne Victory, the Newcastle Jets, the New Zealand Knights, Perth Glory, the Queensland Roar, and Sydney FC. Along with four former NSL clubs taking part; Adelaide United, the Newcastle Jets, and Perth Glory, as well as the Queensland Lions who withdrew their first team from the Queensland State League and entered as the Queensland Roar plus the New Zealand Knights who were formed from the New Zealand Football Kingz. Club were given a five-year exclusivity deal in their own market as part of a &quot;one-city, one-team&quot; policy strategy; intended to allow clubs to grow and develop an identity in their respective region without local competition.

===Initial seasons===
On 26 August 2005, 16 months after the demise of the NSL, the inaugural season of the A-League began. The first season would see Adelaide United win the premier&#x27;s plate by seven points over Sydney FC with Central Coast and Newcastle filling the final two spots in the final series. In the final series, Sydney that took out the title after they defeated Central Coast by a Steve Corica goal to claim the first title on 5 March 2006. The following season saw Melbourne Victory claim the A-League premiers plate when they smashed Adelaide United 6–0 in the final at the Telstra Dome with Archie Thompson scoring five goals in the rout. But the season wasn&#x27;t without a change with the New Zealand Knights being replaced by the Wellington Phoenix after the Knights were taken over by New Zealand Football after the team only won six times in forty-two games and selected overseas talent instead of local.

===Development and reforms===
Both Gold Coast United and the North Queensland Fury joined the league in the 2009–10 season. On 12 June 2009, Melbourne Heart was awarded a licence to join the 2010–11 season. On 1 March 2011 North Queensland Fury&#x27;s A-League licence was revoked for financial reasons. On 29 February 2012, Gold Coast United also had its licence revoked. On 4 April 2012, it was announced that a new Western Sydney-based club, Western Sydney Wanderers, would join the league for the 2012–13 season. In January 2014, Melbourne Heart was acquired by the City Football Group and was renamed Melbourne City ahead of the 2014–15 season. In February 2018, officials announced that the league would expand to 12 teams for the 2019–20 season. Later that year, the league announced that Western United FC would join the competition in 2019–20 and Macarthur would enter the following season (2020–21).

In the lead-up to the expansion announcements in 2019, club stakeholders entered into discussions with Football Federation Australia (FFA) to take over ownership of the competition. The league had been created and operated by the FFA since its inception in 2004, though by 2018 the FFA and clubs were at loggerheads over the permanent ownership structure of the league. A FIFA-backed congress review working group issued a sweeping 100-page report in August 2018, recommending an expanded domestic congress and an independent A-League, controlled and operated by the clubs. 

On 1 July 2019, the FFA and Australian Professional Football Clubs Association (the body representing the A-League clubs) announced an agreement had been reached for the FFA to relinquish control of the league to the clubs by the following month, in time for the start of the 2019–20 season. The agreement brought the sport in line with the governance structure utilised in most European leagues. The new ownership body is called the Australian Professional Leagues, a consortium of the A-League clubs and their owners, with certain rights held by the FFA, and a capital investment &amp; ownership stake held by American firm Silver Lake. A-League officials in May 2021 announced that the league will align to the Domestic Match Calendar to avoid clashing with FIFA Days, as well as introducing Domestic Transfer System and National Club Licensing frameworks.

==Competition format==
===Regular season===
The regular season runs mainly during the Australian summer, from early October to April of the following year. As of the 2024–25 season, due to the introduction of Auckland FC and an odd number of teams, the competition consists of 29 rounds, with each team playing every other team two or three times, playing 26 games total. Each team will play 24 home and away fixtures, plus two additional third matches (one of which in Unite Round). Additionally, each team will have three byes. The teams allotted two home matches against an opponent in one season are allotted one home match against that opponent in the following season. Each match sees the winning team awarded three competition points, with one point each for a draw. The club at the top of this ladder is crowned A-League Premiers, and since the 2005–06 season has been entered into the AFC Champions League. The Premier is presented with a trophy known as the Premier&#x27;s Plate.

At the completion of the regular season the top six placed teams on the league table progress to the finals series. The position of each team is determined by the highest number of points accumulated during the regular season. If two or more teams are level on points, the following criteria are applied in order until one of the teams can be determined as the higher ranked:
# Highest goal difference;
# Highest number of goals scored;
# Most wins;
# Highest number of points accumulated in matches between the teams concerned;
# Highest goal difference in matches between the teams concerned;
# Highest number of goals scored in matches between the teams concerned;
# Lowest number of red cards accumulated;
# Lowest number of yellow cards accumulated;
# Toss of a coin.

====Unite Round====

For the 2023–24 and 2024–25 season, the Australian Professional Leagues announced &quot;Unite Round&quot;. During this round, all matches were held in Sydney, in Allianz Stadium and CommBank Stadium, with some women&#x27;s matches being held at Leichhardt Oval, across the second weekend of January. The round is part of a partnership with Destination NSW, and was introduced after the Grand Final decision was reversed in October 2023, one year into its original 3-year stretch after severe fan backlash.

====Pride Round====

After Adelaide United player Josh Cavallo became the first openly gay top-flight male footballer in October 2021, the A-League partnered with A-League Women to stage a single Pride men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s doubleheader during the 2021–22 season.

On 24–26 February 2023, both the A-League Men and Women&#x27;s competitions staged their first-ever Pride Round, the first occasion in which the leagues had &quot;come together to recognise and promote inclusion for the LGBTQIA+ community&quot;. Part proceeds from ticket sales across all of the round&#x27;s fixtures were donated to Pride Cup. In 2024, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced the continuation of the round, as well as providing inclusion training to all players and key stakeholders. The A-Leagues would be collaborating with the PFA and Pride Cup, who would help to deliver the training. The annual Pride Cup double-header between Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory would take place in March, and several men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams would celebrate by engaging community groups and using indicators such as rainbow corner flags, armbands, special Pride kit and/or rainbow socks.

===Finals series===

The top six clubs at the conclusion of the regular season progress to the finals series. The finals series culminates to the A-League grand final, where the winner is crowned A-League champion. The club that wins the grand final is presented with the A-League Champions Trophy.

The finals series consists of six teams who are placed by rank, as determined at the end of the regular season. The finals series runs over four weeks. In the first week of fixtures, the third-through-sixth ranked teams play a single-elimination match, with the two winners of those matches joining the first and second ranked teams in two-legged ties played over two weeks. The two winners of those matches meet in the grand final. This method was initially adopted for the 2021–22 season.

Up until 2022, between the two grand finalists, the team that finished higher on the ladder at the conclusion of the regular season hosted the grand final. The only exception to this was if the FA deemed that team&#x27;s home ground to be an inappropriate venue. For example, in 2008, Central Coast Mariners (as the higher-placed team) hosted the grand final against the Newcastle Jets at Sydney Football Stadium, due to FFA deciding that Central Coast Mariners&#x27; home stadium, Central Coast Stadium with a capacity of 20,000, was too small for the event.

On 12 December 2022, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced that the grand finals for the 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25 seasons would be hosted in Sydney, a decision which received considerable backlash. On 18 October 2023, the APL announced that the Grand Final hosting rights would revert to the original format, and instead a new &quot;Unite Round&quot; was introduced, with a regular season round having all its games played in Sydney.

Grand final host stadium

===Continental qualification===
====AFC Champions League====

A-League clubs are eligible for participation in the AFC Champions League competition each season since the 2007 edition of the tournament. Wellington Phoenix and Auckland FC are not eligible to compete in the Asian Champions League, nor do they compete in the OFC Champions League. Qualification is determined by league finishing positions and the winner of the Australia Cup Final, with the number of positions determined by the Asian Football Confederation club competition ranking. Due to the re-formatting of the AFC Champions League to have an inter-year schedule from September (northern hemisphere autumn-to-spring) instead of an intra-year schedule (northern hemisphere spring-to-autumn), the qualification format for the 2023–24 AFC Champions League was changed, with a single qualification spot going to whichever of which of the Premiers for the 2021–22 or the 2022–23 seasons accrues the most combined points over both seasons.

The only Australian side to win the Asian Champions League is Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014. Adelaide United is the only other club to reach the final, and finished runner-up in 2008.

====AFC Cup/AFC Champions League Two====
Australian clubs also participated in the AFC Cup for the first time in the 2023–24 season, with allocated slots based on the AFC Club Competitions Ranking which was published on 24 November 2021. Central Coast Mariners won this edition in their first ever participation.

===Other competitions===
In 2004–05, Australia was still a part of the Oceania Football Confederation and Sydney FC won the right to compete in the Oceania Club Championship after defeating the Central Coast Mariners in a qualifying tournament.

Since 2014 clubs compete in the annual Australia Cup knock-out tournament (previously known as the FFA Cup). Since 2021, the top eight teams qualify for the competition&#x27;s Round of 32, while the bottom four teams play-off against each other for the final two slots.

Between 2005 and 2008 clubs participated in the A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup prior to each A-League regular season. In 2013 and 2014 an A-League All Stars Game was also played as a pre-season friendly game between the league&#x27;s finest players and a high-profile international team.

Most A-League Men clubs have teams in the A-League Youth competition, which runs in conjunction with the A-League Men as a national youth developmental and reserve league. All players in the youth teams are between the ages of 16 and 21 as of the start of the calendar year for each new season, while four over-age players from each of the senior teams also allowed to be selected. In addition, the A-League Women operates as the top division of women&#x27;s league with affiliations to the men&#x27;s competition. However, the A-League Youth has not been resumed since the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response to the debate about the development of a new professional second division, the Australian Championship has been proposed to support the A-League, with the aim to avoid the American franchise-based system and to put in line with European football leagues.

==Clubs==

The league is currently contested by 13 teams: eleven from Australia and two from New Zealand. A total of 16 teams have competed at some stage in the league&#x27;s short history. Only four of these clubs – Adelaide United, the Brisbane Roar (as the Queensland Lions), the Newcastle Jets, and the Perth Glory – existed before the A-League was formed in 2004. Gold Coast United, the New Zealand Knights, and the North Queensland Fury have formerly competed in the league.

Unlike most leagues from across the world, there is no system for relegation and promotion of teams. The A-Leagues system thus shares some franchising elements with most other professional leagues in Australia, Major League Soccer, Canadian Premier League, and other major Northern American-based sports leagues.



===Timeline===
 

=== Expansion ===
While making a relatively modest start to ensure future stability, both the FFA and the soccer media indicated significant interest in expanding the league. The eight foundation clubs had exclusivity clauses for their respective cities valid for five years, but this did not exclude teams from other areas joining the league.

Before the introduction of the A-League, FFA chairman Frank Lowy speculated that he hoped to expand the league into other cities, mentioning Canberra, Hobart, Wollongong, Geelong, Bendigo, Cairns, Ballarat, Albury–Wodonga, Launceston, Christchurch, Auckland, Sunshine Coast and possibly Darwin and later Singapore.

In February 2018, officials announced that the league would expand to 12 teams for the 2019–20 season. In December 2018, the FFA announced they accepted the bids of Western United who joined the league in the 2019–20 season and of Macarthur FC, who joined the league in the 2020–21 season.

In 2021, further steps were taken in an attempt to expand from the recent 12 clubs, with goals being set to get 14 clubs in 2022–23 and a potential 16 clubs in 2023–24. Neither of these goals were met.

In March 2023, the Australian Professional Leagues confirmed plans for the next two expansion clubs to be based in Canberra and Auckland, ahead of the 2024–25 season.

In October 2023, the preferred bidder as owner of the new Auckland licence was confirmed to be Bill Foley. The licence was officially awarded to Foley on 21 November, 2023. Auckland FC will join the league in the 2024–25 season.

On 13 June 2024, the APL confirmed that the new Canberra men&#x27;s team would not begin in the 2024–25 season.

On 13 February 2025, it was reported that Canberra&#x27;s entrance would be delayed another season.

=== Rivalries ===
There are several key rivalries and local derbies that have formed in the A-League, including:

&quot;&quot;Melbourne Derby&quot; – Melbourne City v Melbourne Victory&quot;
The two Melbourne clubs first met on 8 October 2010 in a lively game at AAMI Park in front of 25,897 fans. Melbourne City (known at the time as Melbourne Heart) came out on top with a 2–1 victory. A significant narrative in derby history is the role of Melbourne Victory as a more successful club both on and off the field, having joined the A-League five years earlier than City. The rivalry is one of the most intense and well respected in the A-League, producing noticeable atmosphere and some of the largest attendances in the league.

&quot;&quot;The Original Rivalry&quot; – Adelaide United v Melbourne Victory &quot;
The rivalry stems from the traditional cross-border rivalry between sporting teams from South Australia and Victoria but was strengthened by multiple incidents in the 2006–07 season, such as the confrontation between Melbourne Victory captain Kevin Muscat and Adelaide United coach John Kosmina. The two clubs contested the 2007 and 2009 A-League Grand Finals, with Melbourne winning the 2009 Grand Final 1–0 against a 10-man Adelaide United side. The two clubs were also involved in the first and only occasion in the A-League during the 2008–09 A-League season, where they both finished on the top of the ladder equal on both points and goal difference.

&quot;&quot;Sydney Derby&quot; – Sydney FC v Western Sydney Wanderers&quot;
The derby was contested for the first time in the 2012–13 season with the introduction of the second Sydney-based club, Western Sydney Wanderers, into the league. Sydney FC grabbed bragging rights by winning the first derby 1–0 at Parramatta Stadium, however Western Sydney Wanderers won the return match at Allianz Stadium 2–0. A Sydney Derby held early in the 2015 season broke the Allianz Stadium record for attendance during a regular season in any football code, dating back to the stadium&#x27;s opening in 1988. A match in 2016 between the two teams broke the record A-League crowd with 61,880 fans attending the match at ANZ Stadium. Sydney Derby is intensified by the geographic distinction between the two clubs within Sydney, as well as historical grievances related to the foundation of Sydney FC.

&quot;&quot;The Big Blue&quot; – Melbourne Victory v Sydney FC&quot;
This match is so named because blue is the main colour of both teams&#x27; playing kits, and is also Australian slang for a fight or a contest. The rivalry has emerged as a result of a number of spiteful encounters between the teams in recent years, and due to the longstanding rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia&#x27;s two largest cities. The teams have competed against each other in three grand finals; in 2010 &amp; 2017, with Sydney winning 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw on both occasions and in 2015, with Victory winning 3–0. In 2010, Sydney FC won the A-League Premiership on the final day of the season by defeating Victory 2–0. A Big Blue match is traditionally played on Australia Day each year.

&quot;&quot;The F3 Derby&quot; – Central Coast Mariners v Newcastle Jets&quot;
Named after the former name of the freeway that connects the cities of Newcastle and Gosford, this match features the only two clubs in the A-League that are not based in state or national capital cities. The two teams&#x27; stadiums are just one hour apart, and the derby was intensified when they competed against each other for the premiership in the 2007–08 A-League season and eventually met in the Grand Final, which was won 1–0 by the Jets. Since 2022, the teams have competed for a trophy made out of a core drill sample of the motorway.

&quot;&quot;The Distance Derby&quot; – Perth Glory v Wellington Phoenix&quot;
First contested in Wellington with their introduction to the A-League in 2007–08, this fixture is considered one of the longest away trips in world football for a domestic top-flight competition, with the distance between the two cities (which themselves are in different countries) being 5,225 km. Since 2015–16, the two teams have contested the &quot;Long Distance Derby Cup&quot;, which is awarded to the team with the best results from the three regular season fixtures between them.

&quot;&quot;New Zealand Derby&quot; / &quot;Mai te Raki ki te Tonga&quot; – Auckland FC v Wellington Phoenix&quot;
With the introduction of expansion club Auckland FC for the 2024–25 season, Wellington will have an opponent from the same country for the first time. The first ever edition of this derby is scheduled for 2 November 2024 at Wellington Regional Stadium, and they will meet a further two times during the season. On 9 August 2024, Auckland announced the signing of former Wellington goalkeeper Alex Paulsen, on loan from AFC Bournemouth which was thought to be in contravention of the &quot;Caceres rule&quot; which the APL had only announced that morning would be reviewed. Following this announcement, Wellington raised concerns with Football Australia &quot;seeking further information&quot; about the loan move. Shortly before the start of the 2024–25 season, the League announced the official name of the derby would be &quot;Kiwi Clasico&quot;, however, official channels stopped using that name once the season began. On the day of the first ever match between the two clubs, Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Whātua presented a special taonga to be awarded to the winner, and dubbed the derby &quot;Mai te Raki ki te Tonga&quot;, which translates to &#x27;From the North to the South&#x27; from te reo Māori.

==Organisation==

===Logo and trophies===

The current A-League logo was unveiled in September 2021, as part of a re-branding of both the A-League and W-League, bringing them under the same umbrella of &quot;A-Leagues&quot; by the Australian Professional Leagues. The logo was designed by R/GA, a creative agency in Sydney, and led to a major controversy but narrowly avoided legal trouble with building company in Adelaide over design similarities. Isuzu UTE became the naming rights sponsor of the A-League Men in October 2021, and therefore features on all branding. This partnership was extended a further two years in December 2023.

In January 2017, Football Federation Australia unveiled their new A-League logo which formed part of a wider rebranding branding of the A-League and its subsidiary competitions, the W-League and Youth League. The logo design was &quot;inspired by soccer&#x27;s three outstanding features – atmosphere, diversity and unity&quot; and has colour alterations tailored to each of the 12 A-League clubs. The changes came into effect before the 2017/18 season. The original A-League logo was designed by Coast Design Sydney. It was the inaugural logo of the league. The two-toned ochre colours represented the sun, earth and desert while the &#x27;glow&#x27; emanating from the centre of the logo depicted the playing season&#x27;s spring and summer time span. The eight &#x27;A&#x27; figures that made up the ball shape represented the eight foundation clubs of the league. 

The A-League has two trophies which are competed for during the season: the Premier&#x27;s Plate and the A-League Trophy. The Premier&#x27;s Plate is awarded to the A-League Premiers, the regular season winners, and the A-League Trophy is awarded to the A-League Champions, the winner of the Grand Final. Both pieces of silverware were designed by Sydney design company D3 Design. The A-League Trophy is nicknamed the &quot;Toilet Seat&quot; due to its shape. Where as the Premier&#x27;s Plate follows a traditional trophy design, the A-League Trophy differs. In 2005, John O&#x27;Neill, FFA CEO commented during the unveiling of the A-League Trophy, &quot;We have a new national league and we feel it is important to re-define the conventional view of a trophy to reflect this&quot;. Clive Solari of D3 Design explained the trophy&#x27;s design, saying &quot;We wanted our trophy concept to embody the historical significance of sport in a contemporary design. So we looked to history to see how great achievements have been rewarded across all types of games for thousands of years. The winners of the world&#x27;s original sporting competition, the Olympic Games, were presented with a laurel wreath on their heads. We used this model as a basis for a unique, cutting-edge design – our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath. The winners can hold it above their heads as a symbol of success&quot;.

===Squad formation and salary cap===

The A-League match-day squad includes the typical 11 players, and five substitutes of which one must be a goalkeeper. Prior to the 2013–14 season, just four substitutes including one goalkeeper were allowed to be named in the starting line-ups for the teams.

An A-League squad must comprise a minimum of 20 players with a maximum of 26, subject to several limitations. Within the squad, there can be a maximum of five &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;Visa&quot; players, from outside Australia (and New Zealand, in the case of Wellington Phoenix), that hold a temporary working-visa. Three players in the squad must also be under 20 years of age. In addition to these three under 20 players, clubs are allowed to sign an additional three youth players onto full-time contracts at a lower pay rate than the rest of the squad. The A-League had initially proposed that the quota of five visa players per A-League club be reduced to four in the 2015–16 season, with the limit of four possibly become &quot;3+1&quot;, which means three imports from anywhere and one from Asia (following regulations in the AFC Champions League). However, after opposition to the proposal by both players and managers, the move was placed on hold.

Although A-League clubs have restricted salaries (salary cap), the league allows each club to have two &quot;marquee&quot; players whose salaries are exempt from the cap, plus a number of other &#x27;exemptions&#x27; or &#x27;allowances&#x27; to incentivise clubs to spend in specific areas. Guest players are also excluded for up to a maximum of 14 league matches. From the formation of the league, clubs have been allowed to sign one international marquee player. From the 2008–09 season, A-League clubs have been permitted a junior marquee player; one that is under the age of 23. Now known as the &#x27;Homegrown Player allowance&#x27;, clubs can spend up to a collective $150,000 on three Australian players aged 23 or younger that have come through the club&#x27;s youth system. On 19 April 2010, the A-League announced that, in addition to the international marquee and junior marquee, clubs would be allowed an Australian marquee player from the 2010–11 season. Notable marquee and guest players in the A-League have included Alessandro Del Piero, William Gallas, Dwight Yorke, Keisuke Honda, Damien Duff, Emile Heskey, Robbie Fowler, Shinji Ono, David Villa and former FIFA World Player of the Year Romário. Famous Australian Marquees include Harry Kewell, John Aloisi, Brett Emerton, Joshua Kennedy and Tim Cahill. From the 2021–22 A-League Men season, the league added a designated player slot, whose salary is exempt from the cap, but must be $300,000–$600,000 per season. The following season, the league added a second designated player slot for each club.

Commencing in the 2015–16 season, players who have played at their club for 5–10 years will be covered by a &quot;loyalty player allowance&quot;, allowing up to $200,000 of their salary to be exempted from the cap. Additionally, clubs are now permitted a mature-age rookie whose wages are outside the salary cap.

The 2016–17 season saw the introduction of a third &#x27;Full Season Guest Marquee&#x27; spot, designed to attract high-profile players on short-term deals.

The salary cap for A-League clubs is $2.1 million for the 2020–21 season. In the case for Western United and debuting Macarthur FC, they are entitled to a $333,000 allowance thus increasing their salary cap to $2.433 million. Clubs must spend at least the salary floor which is $1.7 million. The salary cap applies to the 18 to 23 players that clubs have registered to their A-League player roster, the top 2 highest-paid players (Designated Players) don&#x27;t count in the cap. Unless specifically exempt, all payments and benefits (e.g. cars, accommodation, etc.) provided by a club to a player are included in the club&#x27;s salary cap. Players registered at a club for more than 4 consecutive years as a professional are considered as Loyalty Players and have the following amounts exempt from a club&#x27;s salary cap; Year 4 – 12.5%, Year 5 – 25%, and 5% increments after that up until a max of 50%. Teams can spend an unlimited amount on 4 U-23 Australian players who have come from the youth team, called Homegrown Players. Teams can sign up to 9 U-20 players on minimum wage called Scholarship Players who don&#x27;t count in the squad unless they are one of the 3 U21&#x27;s in the squad, any payments above the national minimum wage to these Players are included in the club&#x27;s Salary Cap.

===Stadiums===
A-League games have been played in 33 stadiums since the inaugural season of the A-League in 2005.

===Sponsorship===
Since its formation, the A-League has been sponsored by an official naming rights partner. In 2004, the Hyundai Motor Company was announced as the sponsor for the first three seasons of the league, known for commercial purposes as the &quot;Hyundai A-League&quot;. In 2008, Hyundai renewed its initial contract with FFA for another four seasons until 2012, and that contract was further extended by four seasons until 2016. This sponsorship deal was then further extended to the end of the 2019–20 A-League season.

On 23 December 2020, it was announced that the new major sponsor of the A-League and W-League would be home improvement store Bunnings Warehouse.

On 6 October 2021, Isuzu UTE was announced as the naming rights partner of the A-League Men in a 3-year deal, with the league known as the Isuzu UTE A-League.
==League championships==
As of the 2023–24 season, 15 different clubs have competed in the league, with eight having won the trophy, and eight winning at least one premier&#x27;s plate. 6 clubs have won a Premiership-Championship double, a feat achieved 11 times in total.

The winner of the regular season tournament is dubbed the &#x27;Premier&#x27; while the winner of the grand final is the season&#x27;s &#x27;Champion&#x27;. This differs from other football codes in Australia, where &#x27;premier&#x27; refers to the winner of the grand final and the winner of the regular season is the &#x27;minor premier&#x27;.

==Records==

Brisbane Roar hold the record for the longest unbeaten run in the competition with 36 league matches without defeat.

Jamie Maclaren holds the record for the greatest number of A-League goals, with 151 goals, playing for Perth Glory, Brisbane Roar, and Melbourne City. The A-League record for most goals in a single match is held by Archie Thompson, scoring 5 goals against Adelaide United on 18 February 2007, during the 2007 A-League Grand Final; and Jamie Maclaren who scored 5 goals against Melbourne Victory on 17 April 2021.

Jamie Maclaren has scored the most A-League hat-tricks with 8.

Shane Smeltz and Bobô are the only players to have scored hat-tricks in consecutive matches.

Henrique was the first, and so far only, player to score a hat-trick coming on as a substitute, for Brisbane Roar against Newcastle Jets.

In 2015, Austrian striker Marc Janko broke the record for scoring in consecutive matches when he scored in seven games for Sydney FC.

==Media coverage==
===In Australia===

From the start of the 2005–06 season to the 2012–13 season, television coverage of the A-League in Australia had been restricted to the subscription-only Fox Sports channel, to which only 7% of Australian residents had access.

On 19 November 2012, free-to-air Australian public broadcasting television network SBS secured the shared rights, alongside long-time A-League broadcasters Fox Sports, to the A-League from the 2013–14 season with a A$160 million four-year broadcast deal.

SBS&#x27;s coverage ended in the 2016–17 season, with Network Ten securing free-to-air broadcast rights. Ten simulcasted the Fox Sports coverage of the Saturday night fixture on its digital multichannel One.

From the 2019–20 season, ABC TV has broadcast one game a weekend (Saturday 5pm) live on its primary channel. It also has the right to broadcast delayed coverage of some finals matches and the Grand Final. Fox Sport&#x27;s contract with the A-League, which was renegotiated in June 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, concluded in July 2021.

Since August 2021, as part of a five-year deal with ViacomCBS, the A-Leagues are being broadcast by Network 10 and Paramount+ streaming service. Initially one A-League Men match per weekend was broadcast on Ten&#x27;s main channel and all matches were streamed on Paramount. Paramount+ and 10 hold broadcasting rights through to 2028.

===Other countries===
In New Zealand the league has been broadcast on Sky Sport since its inaugural season. In the 2019–20 season, the league also broadcast on Qatari beIN Sports after Sky ink four-year partnership for extensive soccer coverage, especially the A-league.

The growth of coverage of the A-League outside Australia saw the league broadcast in 65 countries around the world in 2013/14. Full match broadcasts are available in the United States, China, Italy, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, the Caribbean, Hong Kong, Singapore and Myanmar. In addition to the full match broadcasts, highlights of A-League matches can be viewed in 53 countries throughout Asia and the Middle East, including Japan and South Korea. In 2014, a three-season deal with Sony TEN allowed the league to be broadcast live in Asian nations including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Every A-League match is also live streamed globally, allowing games to be viewed online through a subscription service provided in a partnership with the FFA. All games were also broadcast live in the United States on ESPN+ until 2021. Most games in the United Kingdom are broadcast by BT Sport but use Paramount+ live feed for every live game. For the 2014–15 Season, the A-League was broadcast in 173 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;A-League 2014/15 Season Report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion===
The A-League has been promoted using a number of different advertising slogans and strategies since its inception. At the start of the inaugural season, a 3 million dollar advertising campaign was launched, with the television and film advertisements produced by Ridley Scott&#x27;s production company Scott Free Productions. The theme for the campaign was: &quot;Football, but not as you know it&quot;. A new television advertisement was created for the start of the 2007–08 season, which debuted on Foxtel&#x27;s program Total Football. It was filmed at Bob Jane Stadium in Melbourne. Other campaigns include the &quot;90 minutes, 90 emotions&quot;, which was used for two seasons from 2007 to 2009 and was accompanied by the music track &quot;My People&quot; from Australian act The Presets.

===Current broadcasters===
Broadcasters as of the 2024–25 season are as follows:

<doc id="1301382" wikidata="Q1332057" url="?curid=1301382" title="Classical Japanese">
<text>The classical Japanese language (, &quot;bungo&quot;, &quot;literary language&quot;), also called and sometimes simply called &quot;Medieval Japanese&quot;, is the literary form of the Japanese language that was the standard until the early Shōwa period (1926–1989). It is based on Early Middle Japanese, the language as spoken during the Heian period (794–1185), but exhibits some later influences. Its use started to decline during the late Meiji period (1868–1912) when novelists started writing their works in the spoken form. Eventually, the spoken style came into widespread use, including in major newspapers, but many official documents were still written in the old style. After the end of World War II, most documents switched to the spoken style, although the classical style continues to be used in traditional genres, such as haiku and waka. Old laws are also left in the classical style unless fully revised.

The terms (&quot;bungo&quot;, &quot;written language&quot;) and (&quot;kōgo&quot;, &quot;spoken language&quot;) are still used for classical and modern Japanese, respectively. Their literal meanings are only historical, as classical Japanese is no longer used, while modern Japanese is the only current written language, despite its name. These terms are often used in descriptions of grammar to distinguish classical and modern inflections. For example, the &quot;bungo&quot; inflection of the verb 書く (&quot;kaku,&quot; &quot;to write&quot;) is quadrigrade (&quot;kaka&quot;, &quot;kaki&quot;, &quot;kaku&quot;, &quot;kake&quot;), but its &quot;kōgo&quot; inflection is quintigrade due to a historical sound change (&quot;kaka&quot;, &quot;kakō&quot; &lt; &quot;kakau&quot; &lt; &quot;kakamu&quot;, &quot;kaki&quot;, &quot;kaku&quot;, &quot;kake&quot;).

== History ==

Classical Japanese began to be written during the Heian period, at which point it was very similar to spoken Japanese. It became the written standard for the Japanese language for many centuries, though the spoken language continued to evolve and by the Edo period was substantially different from classical Japanese. This is known as diglossia, a situation in which two forms of a language, in this case a written and spoken form, coexist. During the Meiji period, some intellectuals sought the abolition of classical Japanese, such as the Genbun Itchi movement, which proposed that written Japanese conform to the vernacular spoken language. Futabatei Shimei&#x27;s 1887 novel &quot;The Drifting Cloud&quot; was one of the first novels to be written in vernacular Japanese rather than classical. By 1908, novels no longer used classical Japanese, and by the 1920s the same was true of all newspapers. Government documents remained in classical Japanese until 1946. Classical Japanese continues to be taught in Japanese high schools and universities due to its importance in the study of traditional Japanese literature.

== Orthography ==

Classical Japanese is written in an orthography that differs from modern Japanese in two major ways. These are the usage of old character forms (, &quot;kyūjitai&quot;) and historical kana usage (, &quot;rekishi-teki kana-zukai&quot;).

Old character forms are the forms of Chinese characters (, &quot;kanji&quot;) used in Japan before the post-World War II spelling reforms there. The modern, simplified characters are called .

A few examples follow, with the old characters on the left and the new characters on the right:
*
*
*
*

The kana spelling of a kanji is not unique; e.g. in modern Japanese, note the difference in the reading of between (, &quot;physical body&quot;) and (, &quot;forms of government&quot;). The above spelling differences are etymological. For example, is just a native Japanese word labeled by a Chinese character with similar meaning, while is totally a new word derived from the combination of original meanings of two Chinese characters ( means &quot;politics&quot; and means &quot;body&quot;).

In cases like those of the first two, the entire original character has essentially been replaced by a new one, independent of the original&#x27;s etymology. This type, however, is relatively rare. Another approach is to essentially replace the character with a piece of it, sometimes slightly altered, as in the third and fourth characters. Finally, probably the most common type of simplification is to change one component of the character to reduce the number of strokes and/or make it easier to write, a strategy exemplified by the fifth and sixth examples. Note that, as in the case of the sixth character, the simplification may be very subtle.

In general, old character forms are identical to their traditional Chinese counterparts, but there are some exceptions. For the seventh example character (), the traditional and simplified Japanese versions coexisted as different forms of the same traditional character in Modern Chinese, while in Japan, what is now the new character form was at that time considered a variant and rarely used. And in a few cases, like that of the eighth character (), the old character form has always been considered a rare variant in Modern Chinese. (However, and are actually the formal forms in Middle Chinese and Old Chinese.)

Historical kana usage is the system of kana (i.e., phonetic character) writing used in Japan before the post-war reforms. More specifically, it is the version of kana orthography standardized in the Meiji Period (since before that time kana usage was not standardized). It is, broadly speaking, based on the pronunciation of Japanese in the Heian Period, the time-frame in which Early Middle Japanese (on which the grammar of classical Japanese is based) was spoken. There are several differences between historical kana usage—which is also referred to as —and the modern kana orthography, called or . Some of these differences apply primarily to Sino-Japanese readings of Chinese characters, while others apply primarily to native Japanese words, and still others apply equally to both groups of words.

Broadly speaking, the differences are:

==== rule ====

* Some morpheme-medial sounds currently written as , , , , and (&quot;wa&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;o&quot;) were written as , , , , and (&quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;fu&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, and &quot;ho&quot;), respectively. This is because these sounds (as well as all sounds still written with , , , , and ) originally had initial consonant in Old Japanese, which then changed to in Early Middle Japanese, and then, in Late Middle Japanese, split into one of five different phonemes depending on whether it occurred morpheme-initially or morpheme-medially, and then further depending on the following vowel. Morpheme-initially and before , , or , it became ; before , it became ; and before , it became ; these three sounds are still written with , , , , and . Morpheme-medially and before , , , or , it became ; before , it lost its consonant. Finally, later on in the same period of the language the initial was lost in all instances before , , and (note that never existed), leaving the current morpheme-medial pronunciations of , , , , and , but the spellings of , , , , and (which, in this context, are probably better thought of as , , , , and ; or , , , , and ). This rule primarily applies to native Japanese morphemes, although it is crucial to the mechanics of the long vowel rule that applies primarily to Sino-Japanese words, which is elaborated upon below. The modern usage of (&quot;ha&quot;) and (&quot;he&quot;) to represent grammatical particles pronounced as if written (&quot;wa&quot;) and (&quot;e&quot;), respectively, is a holdover from this rule.

Some examples follow (old spellings are on the left, new spellings on the right; kana in parentheses represent the pronunciation of the preceding character):


There are some exceptions to this sound change, although they are rare. They include (&quot;haha &quot;mother&quot;, expected form &quot;hawa), (&quot;hoho &quot;cheek&quot;, expected form &quot;hō), (&quot;ahiru&quot; &quot;domestic duck&quot;, expected form &quot;airu&quot;), and (&quot;afure-ru&quot; &quot;overflow&quot;, expected form &quot;aore-ru&quot; or &quot;ōre-ru&quot;. Sometimes, as in the case of the first two exceptions, the sound change form exists, usually with a slightly different meaning ( &quot;hawa&quot; is a hyper-formal and very respectful term for mother) or is used in different contexts ( &quot;hō&quot; is generally used in isolation, while &quot;hoho&quot; is generally used in compounds). In other cases, as is true of the second two exceptions, the unchanged form is the only one that exists. In addition to these exceptions, some dialects may preserve these sounds as they were at any stage of the language.

==== rule ====

:&quot;This section uses Nihon-shiki romanization for , , and .&quot;

* The obsolete characters (&quot;wi&quot;) and (&quot;we&quot;) are used, and the character (&quot;wo&quot;) is used in other words besides as the accusative or oblique case marker. This relates to the above rule, in that it reflects a pronunciation with initial before , , and that is no longer present in the modern language. This rule applies equally to native and Sino-Japanese words. The use of (&quot;wo&quot;) to write the aforementioned grammatical particle, which is pronounced (&quot;o&quot;) in modern Japanese (unless preceded by &quot;n&quot; or sometimes in song, although &quot;all&quot; morpheme-medial instances of , whether originally , , or , tend to become in song), is a holdover from this rule.

Some examples:

Native Japanese words
* → いる (only in kana) (wi-ru&quot; → i-ru&quot; &quot;to be [animate objects]&quot;)
* (&quot;kowe → &quot;koe &quot;voice&quot;) (notice that an old character is also involved in this example)
* (wotoko&quot; → otoko&quot; &quot;male&quot;)
Sino-Japanese words
* (&quot;yakuwin&quot; → &quot;yakuin&quot; &quot;officer&quot;)
* (wen&quot; → en&quot; &quot;Yen&quot;) (again, there is an old character used here)
* (&quot;kawoku&quot; → &quot;kaoku&quot; &quot;house&quot;)

There are no known exceptions (besides the aforementioned ones regarding &quot;wo&quot;) in standard Japanese, and no dialects preserve the distinction between and , and , and/or and , but some of the Ryukyuan languages (which are also descended from Proto-Japonic) do.

==== rule ====

:&quot;This section uses Nihon-shiki romanization for , , , .&quot;

* The characters (&quot;di&quot;) and (&quot;du&quot;) are used in places other than changes caused by sequential voicing ( &quot;Rendaku&quot;), where in modern kana (&quot;ji&quot;) and (&quot;zu&quot;), respectively, would be used. Again, this represents a former phonetic distinction, namely between a sound (in &quot;ji&quot; and &quot;zu&quot;) and a sound (in &quot;di&quot; and &quot;du&quot;). This rule applies equally to native and Sino-Japanese words, as well as a few loanwords ( &quot;Gairaigo&quot;).

Some examples:

Native words
* (&quot;adisawi&quot; → &quot;azisai&quot; &quot;hydrangea&quot;) (notice that this example also contains a change from &quot;wi&quot; to &quot;i&quot;)
* (&quot;midu → &quot;mizu &quot;water&quot;)
Sino-Japanese words
* (&quot;kaidiyo → &quot;kaizyo &quot;release&quot;) (notice the use of Y-row rule, explained below)
* (&quot;chidu → &quot;chizu &quot;map&quot;) (notice again that an old character form is involved)
Loanwords
* (&quot;radio&quot; → &quot;razio&quot; &quot;radio&quot;) (this one is especially notable because it is an exceedingly rare example of a sound change that occurs in a loanword from English)

There are no known exceptions in standard Japanese pronunciation, although there are many dialects (such as the Tosa dialect) that preserve the distinction between historical and in speech, usually by using and for historical and and for historical (see Yotsugana). In writing, the distinction is preserved in single morphemes in cases where a sequence (&quot;chidi&quot;) or (&quot;tsudu&quot;) was historically produced by rendaku (such as in &quot;chidim-u&quot;, &quot;shorten&quot;, and &quot;tsuduk-u&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, pronounced as if &quot;chizim-u&quot; and &quot;tsuzuk-u&quot;, respectively), or in compounds where a phonemic or has been voiced to or (such as in &quot;mi-dika&quot; &quot;one&#x27;s surroundings&quot; and &quot;kana-dukai&quot; &quot;kana usage&quot;, pronounced as if &quot;mi-zika&quot; and &quot;kana-zukai&quot;, respectively). This usage is a holdover from this rule.

==== rule ====

In modern Japanese, the small kana , , and (&quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot;, and &quot;yo&quot;) are used to indicate palatalized consonants ( &quot;Yōon&quot;) when following an I-column ( &quot;I-dan&quot;) kana of the K-, G-, N-, B-, P-, M-, or R-rows (; &quot;Ka-&quot;, &quot;Ga-&quot;, &quot;Na-&quot;, &quot;Ba-&quot;, &quot;Pa-&quot;, &quot;Ma-&quot;, &quot;Ra-gyō&quot;). For example:

* (&quot;kyaku&quot; &quot;guest&quot;)
* (&quot;nyojitsu&quot; &quot;reality&quot;)
* (&quot;byakudan&quot; &quot;sandalwood&quot;)
* (&quot;pyokopyoko&quot; &quot;up and down&quot;)
* (&quot;sanmyaku&quot; &quot;mountain range&quot;)
* (&quot;ryaku&quot; &quot;abbreviation&quot;)

When a small Y-row ( &quot;Ya-gyō&quot;) kana follows an I-column kana of the S-, Z-, T-, D-, or H-rows (; &quot;Sa-&quot;, &quot;Za-&quot;, &quot;Ta-&quot;, &quot;Da-&quot;, &quot;Ha-gyō&quot;), the preceding consonant is changed:

* (&quot;shoku&quot; &quot;meal&quot;)
* (&quot;juritsu&quot; &quot;establish&quot;)
* (cha &quot;tea&quot;)
* (&quot;-jū&quot; &quot;throughout [suffix]&quot;) (note that, as noted above, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ju&quot;, and &quot;jo&quot; only occur in modern Japanese writing when a sequence &quot;cha&quot;, &quot;chu&quot;, or &quot;cho&quot; is sequentially voiced, as in this example, and the pronunciation is identical to &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ju&quot;, and &quot;jo&quot;) 
* (&quot;hyaku&quot; &quot;hundred&quot;) (note that the sequence is pronounced as noted above, but this difference is not reflected in any mainstream Japanese romanization system)

These three kana cannot follow A-row ( &quot;A-gyō&quot;) or W-row ( &quot;Wa-gyō&quot;) kana in this way.

In historical kana, all of these examples are written with large kana , , and (&quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot;, and &quot;yo&quot;). So the previous examples would be written:

* (written kiyaku&quot;, but pronounced kyaku&quot;)
* (written niyojitsu&quot;, but pronounced nyojitsu&quot;) (note the presence of an old character form here)
* (written biyaku&quot;, but pronounced byaku&quot;)
* (written piyokopiyoko&quot;, but pronounced pyokopyoko&quot;) (again, multiple iteration marks are used here)
* (written &quot;sanmiyaku&quot;, but pronounced &quot;sanmyaku&quot;)
* (written riyaku&quot;, but pronounced ryaku&quot;)
* (written shiyoku&quot;, but pronounced shoku&quot;)
* (written jiyuritsu&quot;, but pronounced juritsu&quot;)
* (written chiya, but pronounced cha)
* (written &quot;-jiyū, but pronounced &quot;-jū)
* (written hiyaku&quot;, but pronounced hyaku&quot;)

This is the only historical kana rule that does not reflect a historical pronunciation. It is also one of only two rules (along with the geminate rule) that create ambiguity for the reader (excluding the exceptions listed above for the H-row rule). For instance, the aforementioned word (&quot;kyaku&quot;) is not differentiated in historical kana from the word (&quot;kiyaku&quot; &quot;agreement&quot;) when written in historical kana: both are written (&quot;kiyaku&quot;).

==== Geminate (, &quot;sokuon&quot;) rule ====

The other use of small kana in modern Japanese is in the geminate consonant mark ( &quot;Sokuon&quot;), , which is a small version of (&quot;tsu&quot;). In native Japanese words, this symbol can be used before kana of the K-, S-, T-, and P-rows. For example,

* (&quot;kakka&quot; &quot;burning hotly&quot;)
* (&quot;massugu&quot; &quot;straight&quot;)
* (&quot;kitto&quot; &quot;surely&quot;)
* (&quot;happa&quot; &quot;leaf&quot;)

Voiced geminates are generally prohibited by Japanese phonological rules, but they occur in a few loanwords (although they are sometimes pronounced by native speakers as if they were their voiceless counterparts). For example:

* (&quot;suraggā&quot; &quot;slugger&quot;)
* (&quot;kiddo&quot; &quot;kid&quot;)

Kana of the N- and M-rows can also be geminate, but they are preceded by (&quot;n&quot;) to indicate gemination instead.

Gemination can occur in Japanese for a variety of reasons. In native words, it occurs either when a historical long vowel elides, as in the aforementioned (&quot;massugu&quot;, originally &quot;maasugu&quot;), or randomly, as in the aforementioned (&quot;kitto, originally &quot;kito). These examples of the geminate consonant marker, along with those found in loanwords, are written with large (&quot;tsu&quot;) in historical kana. Therefore,

* (written &quot;katsuka, but pronounced &quot;kakka)
* (written &quot;matsusugu&quot;, but pronounced &quot;massugu&quot;)
* (written &quot;kitsuto, but pronounced &quot;kitto)
* (written &quot;hatsupa, but pronounced &quot;happa)
* (written &quot;suratsugā, but pronounced &quot;suraggā)
* (written &quot;kitsudo, but pronounced &quot;kiddo)

In these cases, the historical usage is not reflecting any historical pronunciation. However, in Sino-Japanese words, geminate consonants are produced by different, more regular processes, and the historical usage for these words reflects historical pronunciations.

The most common way for geminates to be produced in Sino-Japanese words is by the elision of a vowel from the kana , , , or (&quot;ki&quot;, &quot;ku&quot;, &quot;chi&quot;, or &quot;tsu&quot;). For example:

* (&quot;tekkaku&quot; &quot;eligible&quot;, from &quot;teki&quot; + &quot;kaku&quot;)
* (&quot;gakki&quot; &quot;semester&quot;, from &quot;gaku&quot; + &quot;ki&quot;)
* (&quot;nittei&quot; &quot;schedule&quot;, from &quot;nichi&quot; + &quot;tei&quot;)
* (&quot;zasshi&quot; &quot;magazine&quot;, from &quot;zatsu&quot; + &quot;shi&quot;)

In historical kana, where the geminate mark is used in the first, second, and fourth examples, a full-sized version of the original kana is used. However, in the third example, (&quot;tsu&quot;) is used, even though an has been elided. The reason for this is that in Early Middle Japanese, when these sounds were borrowed from Middle Chinese, the Japanese language acquired a final in the Sino-Japanese morphemes that currently end in (&quot;chi&quot;, ) or (&quot;tsu&quot;, ). Later on, these acquired two forms, one with and one with (although in syllables beginning with , one form usually begins with , as is the case with ). So the semantic difference between Sino-Japanese syllables ending in or is almost always trivial, and the historical pronunciation was identical, so they were not distinguished in writing. Therefore, the previous examples would be written:

* (&quot;tekikaku&quot;)
* (&quot;gakuki&quot;) (note the old character form)
* (&quot;nitsutei&quot;)
* (&quot;zatsusi&quot;) (note the old character form)

Occasionally, gemination may also result from a loss of a vowel after (&quot;fu&quot;, originally ). These cases are complicated by the H-row rule, and perhaps because of that, are also written with in historical kana. For example,

* (&quot;hosshi&quot; &quot;Buddhist priest&quot;, from &quot;hofu&quot; + &quot;shi&quot;)

is written

* (&quot;hotsushi&quot;)

in historical kana.

While this usage does reflect a historical pronunciation, it, like the Y-row rule, produces ambiguity. Furthermore, since these vowels are elided in some compounds but not others, this usage obscures the difference in a way that is essentially impossible to predict.

While there are a few other processes that can cause geminates in Sino-Japanese words, they all apply to N- and M-row kana, and are not written differently in historical and modern kana.

==== Labialized consonant (, &quot;gōyōon&quot;) rule ====

Starting in Early Middle Japanese, as more and more Chinese characters were borrowed into Japanese, the language acquired consonants fronted with glides. Those fronted with the palatal glide are described in the Y-row rule, but Early Middle Japanese also introduced consonants fronted with labial glides (i.e., CwV). These were far more limited in range than their palatal counterparts, however, affecting only the K- and G- rows. instead of , , and for the vowels of onset, like the palatal glides, the vowels of onset for the labial glides were , , and , and used the kana , , and (&quot;wa&quot;, &quot;wi&quot;, and &quot;we&quot;). Finally, while the palatal glides are written with an I-column kana, the labial glides are written with a U-column ( &quot;U-dan&quot;) kana. However, when historical kana was standardized in the Meiji Period, only the syllables with historical were indicated. Nevertheless, some classical texts may indicate the other differences, and some resources will refer to them, so it is useful to be familiar with them. This rule applies exclusively to Sino-Japanese words. Some examples:

 (written &quot;kuwa&quot;, but pronounced &quot;kwa&quot;) and (written &quot;guwa&quot;, but pronounced &quot;gwa&quot;) (indicated in standard historical kana)
* (kwashi&quot; → kashi&quot; &quot;sweets&quot;)
* (gwantan&quot; → gantan&quot; &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;)
 (written &quot;kuwi&quot;, but pronounced &quot;kwi&quot;), (written &quot;guwi&quot;, but pronounced &quot;gwi&quot;), (written &quot;kuwe&quot;, but pronounced &quot;kwe&quot;), and (written &quot;guwe&quot; but pronounced &quot;gwe&quot;) (not indicated in standard historical kana)
* (kwisei&quot; → kisei&quot; &quot;homecoming&quot;) (note the old character form)
* (gwizen&quot; → gizen&quot; &quot;hypocrisy&quot;) (note the old character form)
* (&quot;bankwen&quot; → &quot;banken&quot; &quot;watchdog&quot;)
* (&quot;dougwetsu&quot; → &quot;dougetsu&quot; &quot;same month&quot;)

Labialized consonants sometimes occur in modern loanwords, and they are generally dealt with in one of two ways. Firstly, the labialized consonant may be changed from a sequence to a sequence , both in writing and in speech. For example,

* (&quot;kuikku&quot; &quot;quick&quot;, from English &quot;quick&quot; with original )

In other cases, they may be indicated with a U-column kana followed by a small A-row kana, indicating a labialized consonant. For example,

* (&quot;kwīn&quot; &quot;queen&quot;, from English &quot;queen&quot; with original )

However, in these cases, an alternative version with large A-row kana generally exists (as it does in this case), indicating a monophthong pronunciation, and many speakers use the monophthong pronunciation regardless of how it is written.

There are no known exceptions to this rule, but some dialects (such as the Kagoshima dialect) preserve the distinction.

==== Long vowel (, &quot;chōon&quot;) rule ====

==== Palatalized long vowel (, &quot;kaiyōchōon&quot;) rule ====

==== Classical auxiliary verb (&quot;mu&quot;) rule ====

Modern Japanese has the moraic nasal (&quot;n&quot;), which can represent a variety of sounds depending on what sounds come before and after it. Syllable final nasals are believed by many scholars to have existed in Proto-Japonic, but all agree that they were lost by the time of Old Japanese. They first re-appeared in Early Middle Japanese, with the introduction of Middle Chinese loanwords ending in &quot;-n&quot; and &quot;-m&quot;. Therefore, the majority of occurrences of (&quot;n&quot;) in modern Japanese occur in Sino-Japanese vocabulary. Originally, syllabic &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; were phonemically and phonologically distinct, although the distinction was never written down, and was lost by Early Modern Japanese. For example,

* (&quot;kanzi&quot;, from Middle Chinese )
* (&quot;ongaku&quot;, from Middle Chinese ; originally pronounced &quot;omgaku&quot;) (note the old character form)

However, some native Japanese words also have (&quot;n&quot;). This happens exceedingly rarely, and usually results from sound elision. An exhaustive list of every example out of all regular-use characters with the syllabic nasal in their native Japanese readings numbers only 13 characters (0.61% of the regular-use set) giving rise to 14 readings. They are

From the elision of a vowel following /m/ or /n/
* (&quot;nan &quot;what&quot;), from (&quot;nani &quot;what&quot;)
* (&quot;wonna&quot; &quot;woman&quot;), originally pronounced &quot;womna&quot;; from (&quot;womina&quot; &quot;woman&quot;) (in modern orthography, onna&quot; and omina&quot;)
* (&quot;nengoro&quot; &quot;courteous&quot;), originally pronounced &quot;nemkoro&quot;; from (&quot;nemokoro&quot; &quot;courteous&quot;)
* (&quot;kan &quot;god&quot; in some compounds), originally pronounced &quot;kam; from (&quot;kami&quot; &quot;god&quot;) (in modern orthography, , using a new character form)
* (&quot;kangaf-u&quot; &quot;consider&quot;), from (&quot;kamugaf-u&quot; &quot;consider&quot;); note that these are the classical versions of the modern verbs (&quot;kangahe-ru&quot;) and (&quot;kaugahe-ru&quot;), respectively (in modern orthography, &quot;kangau, kōga-u, &quot;kangae-ru&quot;, and kōgae-ru&quot;, respectively)
From the elision of a full mora
* (&quot;kanmuri&quot; &quot;crown&quot;), from (&quot;kauburi&quot; &quot;rank&quot;); note also the sound change from to (in modern orthography, kauburi&quot; is kōburi&quot;)
* (&quot;ton &quot;wholesale&quot; in the compound &quot;ton&#x27;ya&quot; &quot;wholesale store&quot;), from (&quot;tohi &quot;query&quot;) (in modern orthography, &quot;tohi is &quot;toi)
* (&quot;sakan &quot;prosperous&quot;), from (&quot;sakari &quot;one&#x27;s best days&quot;)
* (&quot;kanba-shi&quot; &quot;fragrant&quot;), from (&quot;kaguha-si&quot; &quot;fragrant&quot;); note also the sequential voicing of to , and that these are the classical forms of the adjectives (&quot;kanba-shii&quot;) and (&quot;kaguha-shii&quot;) (in modern orthography, &quot;kaguha-shi&quot; is &quot;kaguwa-shi&quot; and &quot;kaguha-shii&quot; is &quot;kaguwa-shii&quot;)
From the preservation of an Old Japanese pre-nasalized consonant in a modern Japanese word
* (&quot;kangami-ru&quot; &quot;learn from&quot;), from (&quot;kagami-ru&quot; &quot;learn from&quot;) (in modern orthography, &quot;kagami-ru&quot; is &quot;kagami-ru&quot;, without iteration marks)
* () (&quot;donburi&quot; &quot;porcelain bowl&quot;), from (&quot;doburi&quot; &quot;[sound symbolism for something big and soft plopping down]&quot;)
From abbreviation of another pronunciation on this list
* () (&quot;don &quot;porcelain bowl&quot;), originally pronounced &quot;dom; from aforementioned (&quot;donburi&quot; &quot;porcelain bowl&quot;)
From multiple processes
* (&quot;on &quot;[honorific prefix]&quot;), originally pronounced &quot;om; from (&quot;oho&quot; &quot;great&quot;) + (mi &quot;august&quot;), which became (&quot;ohomi &quot;august&quot;), and then by elision of after , and finally (&quot;on) by elision of the full mora ; note the use of the character instead of is ateji (in modern orthography, oho is ō, ohomi&quot; is ōmi&quot;, and ohon&quot; is おおん ōn&quot;)
From some semantic (rather than phonetic) process
* (&quot;yon &quot;four&quot;), from (&quot;yo&quot; &quot;four) by analogy with Sino-Japanese (&quot;san &quot;three&quot;, originally pronounced &quot;sam&quot;)

Of course, there are also some words with this sound that either lack Chinese characters or were coined in the modern or Early Modern Japanese eras, when (&quot;n&quot;) had been fully incorporated into the language. For example,

* (&quot;san &quot;[all-purpose honorific]&quot;), originally pronounced &quot;sam; from (&quot;sama&quot; &quot;[respectful honorific]&quot;) (in modern orthography, the new character form is used)

Regardless of how it came to be, the Japanese orthography lacked the character (&quot;n&quot;) or any equivalent. Therefore, until the spelling reforms of 1900, (&quot;mu&quot;) was generally used to represent the syllabic nasal. Sometimes, this convention may be preserved by modern writers, but standard historical kana distinguishes (&quot;mu&quot;) from (&quot;n&quot;).

There is one exception. In classical Japanese, there is an auxiliary verb ( &quot;jodōshi&quot;) (&quot;mu&quot;) which indicated the volitional. It, too, underwent vowel elision, and came to be pronounced as and then . However, the conventions of standard historical kana call for this auxiliary verb (and any word derived from it) to be written with (&quot;mu&quot;) even though they are pronounced as (&quot;n&quot;).

Since the auxiliary verb (&quot;mu&quot;) is non-existent in modern Japanese, there are no dialects that preserve the distinction expressed in this rule. However, some may preserve the distinction between final and .

=== Miscellaneous ===

Two other significant differences involve the &quot;way&quot; that kana are used in general, rather than &quot;which&quot; kana are used. The first is that Chinese characters in classical texts are often fully marked with ruby text ( &quot;Furigana&quot;), especially in old laws and other very important documents. Ruby text is still widely used in modern Japanese, but only for characters with non-standard or ambiguous pronunciations, or sometimes in materials designed for children or foreigners. The second difference is that, especially in legal documents, Katakana were often used in the way that Hiragana are used in modern Japanese, to write out adjective and verb inflections, suffixes, and particles ( &quot;Okurigana&quot;), and for the aforementioned ruby text.

Finally, kana iteration marks were far more common in classical Japanese, and sometimes used in ways that are considered completely obsolete in modern Japanese.

For an example of a major document written in the classical style, see as an example the original text of the 1890 Meiji Constitution, which is written in classical Japanese using historical kana, old character forms, kana iteration marks, and Katakana in place of Hiragana (although it lacks universal ruby text).

== Grammar ==

==== Conjugation table ====

Classical Japanese has the following verb classes and stem forms:

Inflectional form = () + 

Note that most S-irregular is the combination of a noun and ; for example, is a combination of the noun (&#x27;date&#x27;) and .

The (&quot;yo&quot;) at the end of the imperative forms is optional in classical Japanese, although exceedingly common.

==== Verb class distribution ====

While the many conjugation classes may seem overwhelming, most of them contain few verbs. The quadrigrade and lower bigrade classes are the primary, containing about 75% and 20% of the verbs in the language, respectively. The upper bigrade class is small (about 56 non-compound verbs), but sizable enough to make an exhaustive list difficult. The other 6 classes all together contain between 22 and 28 verbs, depending on whether basic compound verbs are included or not. An exhaustive list of these follows, with verbs in the conclusive form, as is the most common standard. Chinese character pronunciations are indicated by hiragana in parentheses following the given character. The first spelling listed for a given verb is the most common, and those that follow are alternative spellings. Some of these spellings are generally used for slightly different connotations of the same verb, while others are simple alternatives. In later reference, only the first spelling (in pre-World War II orthography) will be used, and the transcription will be based on the historical spelling. A blank cell in one (or both) of the &quot;modern&quot; columns indicates that the modern spelling and/or transcription is the same as the pre-World War II version.

===== Table notes =====

Note that these translations are glosses, and may not reflect certain nuances or rare alternative meanings.

In addition, the translations are for the classical meaning of the verb, which may differ from the modern meaning of the verb if it has survived into modern Japanese either slightly (e.g., &quot;ki-ru&quot;, which meant &quot;to wear [in general]&quot; in classical Japanese, but means &quot;to wear [from the waist up]&quot; in modern Japanese), or significantly (e.g., &quot;wi-ru&quot;, which meant &quot;to sit&quot; in classical Japanese, but primarily means &quot;to be&quot; (for animate objects) in modern Japanese). Some may have the same meaning, but a different pronunciation (e.g., &quot;kagami-ru&quot; &quot;to learn from&quot;, which is generally pronounced and written &quot;kangami-ru&quot; in modern Japanese). Also, even for those verbs which have survived with the same meaning and form, many are archaic and rarely used in modern Japanese (e.g., &quot;hi-ru&quot; &quot;to sneeze&quot;, with the same modern meaning and form, but almost never used). On the other hand, some have kept the same meaning, form, and prominence into the modern language (e.g., &quot;mi-ru&quot; &quot;to see&quot;, one of the oldest surviving verbs in the language and also one of the most common, both in classical and modern texts).

 (&quot;imasukar-i&quot; &quot;to exist&quot;, honorific form) has three pronunciation variants, each of which can use either Chinese character: (&quot;imasugar-i&quot;), (&quot;imasokar-i&quot;), and (&quot;imasogar-i&quot;).

Finally, the &quot;modern&quot; transcriptions are purely orthographic. For example, the modern version conclusive form of the classical verb (&quot;k-u&quot; &quot;to come&quot;) is (&quot;k-uru&quot;), but the modern form is given in the table as (&quot;k-u&quot;), which is the way that a modern Japanese writer would write the &quot;classical&quot; Japanese word, rather than the way they would write the &quot;modern&quot; Japanese word.

Classical Japanese has the following classes of adjectives and stem forms:
===== Table notes =====

The existence of irrealis form is still a controversy. Some scholars assume that the ancient construction called (&quot;Ku-gohō&quot; &quot;Ku-grammar&quot;) uses the irrealis form to form nouns from verbs and adjectives; e.g., (&quot;yasu-shi&quot; &quot;peaceful&quot;) → (&quot;yasu-ke&quot;) + (-&quot;ku&quot;) → (&quot;yasukeku&quot; &quot;peace of mind&quot;). Meanwhile, others assumed the construction (-&quot;kuba&quot;) / (-&quot;shikuba&quot;) appears to be an irrealis form (-&quot;ku&quot;) / (-&quot;shiku&quot;) + particle (-&quot;ba&quot;) (since that particle usually attaches to the irrealis form). However, the scholars agreeing with &quot;Ku-grammar theory&quot; argue that it&#x27;s actually (-&quot;ku&quot;) / (-&quot;shiku&quot;) + particle (&quot;ha&quot;; modern pronunciation &quot;wa&quot;) with a sequential voicing sound change from (&quot;ha&quot;) to (&quot;ba&quot;).

The compound forms are derived from continuitive form (-&quot;ku&quot;) / (-&quot;shiku&quot;) + (&quot;ar-i&quot;) → (-&quot;kuar-i&quot;) / (-&quot;shikuar-i&quot;), which then became (-&quot;kar-i&quot;) / (-&quot;shikar-i&quot;) by regular sound change rules from Old Japanese. The forms then follow the R-irregular conjugation type like (&quot;ar-i&quot;), but lack the conclusive form.

Similarly, the basic conjugations have no imperative form. When it is used, therefore, the (-&quot;kar-e&quot;) / (-&quot;shikar-e&quot;) forms are used. It is however, relatively rare, even in classical Japanese.

There are the following classes for adjectival verbs:
===== Table notes =====

Adjectival verbs are essentially nouns(or stems of the adjectives) combined with an auxiliary verb, either (-&quot;nar-i&quot;) or (-&quot;tar-i&quot;).

Most tari-adjectival nouns are derived from Sino-Japanese vocabulary. For example,「」 is derived from 「」, a Chinese word meaning “quietly, softly”.

The auxiliary verbs are derived from directional particles (&quot;ni&quot;) + (-&quot;ar-i&quot;) and (&quot;to&quot;) + (-&quot;ar-i&quot;), respectively, yielding (&quot;niar-i&quot;) and (&quot;toar-i&quot;), respectively, which then lead to (&quot;nar-i&quot;) and (&quot;tar-i&quot;), respectively, by regular sound change rules. They therefore follow the R-irregular conjugation like (&quot;ar-i&quot;).

As with adjectives, the imperative form is rare, but is used.

<text>Augustus Theodore (Theo) Bartholomew (26 August 1882 – 14 March 1933) was a librarian at Cambridge University Library from 1900 until his death in 1933. He maintained friendships with a number of significant individuals, including Siegfried Sassoon, the novelist Forrest Reid and the uranian poet and librarian Charles Sayle. He was editor, with Henry Festing Jones, of the works of Samuel Butler (published 1923–6) and collected material for a biography of Frederick Rolfe.

==Life==

=== Early life and education ===
Bartholomew was born in Walthamstow, the youngest of eight children to Alice Mary Bartholomew (née Chaplin) and Charles Augustus Bartholomew, his father having died shortly before his birth. His mother moved the family to Fowlmere, near Cambridge, and he attended the Nonconformist grammar school in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. His mother&#x27;s lack of funds forced him to leave school at an early age, and seek employment nearby.

In spite of his limited education, Bartholomew felt from an early age a definite desire for a career in books. Initial enquiries to Robert Bowes&#x27; bookshop in Cambridge and the Bodleian Library in Oxford were unsuccessful, and he spent the summer of 1899 working in the Public Library in Norwich.

At the age of 17 he found a job as &quot;Second-Class Assistant&quot; at the University Library at Cambridge (then housed in the mostly medieval Old Schools building), and started work on 29 January 1900 earning 10 shillings a week. In 1901 he was able to enter Peterhouse, Cambridge, as an undergraduate, graduating in 1904 and moving from lodgings on Lensfield Road in Cambridge to Kellet Lodge on Tennis Court Road. In 1906 he became friends with the novelist Forrest Reid, and made his first visit to Venice in 1907, where he met the uranian poet Horatio Brown.

=== Sexuality ===
Bartholomew was homosexual. In his youth, he had been a member of the circle of handsome (and sometimes homosexual) young men who congregated at Charles Edward Sayle&#x27;s house in Cambridge, including Rupert Brooke, George Mallory and Geoffrey Keynes, who remained a close friend throughout his life. Charles Sayle, employed at Cambridge University Library since 1893, became one of the chief figures in his life, taking the young Bartholomew under his wing. In 1909 they invited Henry James to visit Cambridge, where he stayed at Sayle&#x27;s house. Sayle soon became insecure about his young friend deserting him (Sayle was 18 years Bartholomew&#x27;s senior). But they remained friends until Sayle&#x27;s death in 1924, by which time Bartholomew (now in his early forties) now suffered from similar anxieties of growing old in an ever-youthful university city.

He corresponded with authors he admired, including Edward Carpenter (to whom he wrote about the book &#x27;Iolaus&#x27; in 1902 and whom he met in 1911), Magnus Hirschfeld (whom he met at one of Edward Dent&#x27;s dinner parties in 1910) and Ralph Chubb (a younger Cambridge poet whose homosexual poems and paintings had inspired Bartholomew&#x27;s interest).

=== Librarianship ===
After graduation he became part of the team tasked with cataloguing Lord Acton&#x27;s library of 60,000 books, which he had donated to Cambridge. The task took nine years. He became Under-Librarian at Cambridge in 1913, a position he held until his death in 1933.

Books were of course one of his primary interests and in 1903 he was among the first members of the university&#x27;s Baskerville Club. In 1909 he bought a copy of the Doves Press &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; at a cost of £1 10s (which he called &#x27;a horrible extravagance&#x27;) and in November that year was sounded out by Sydney Cockerell about becoming Emery Walker&#x27;s assistant. Through Geoffrey Keynes, he became acquainted with Gwen and Jacques Raverat (Gwen, a granddaughter of Charles Darwin, was the sister of Keynes&#x27; wife Margaret) and acquired a copy of Jacques&#x27; edition of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;The marriage of heaven and hell&quot; (printed at the Ashendene Press in just 24 copies in 1910). With Keynes Bartholomew worked on John Evelyn, the two publishing a handlist of his works in 1916 (in 25 copies), and for a time Bartholomew worked on editing Evelyn&#x27;s diary for publication until giving it up in 1921. He collected a wide range of books, including many on homosexuality and sexology.

In 1915 Bartholomew met Siegfried Sassoon and helped with the publication of his poetry, including &quot;Picture Show&quot; in 1919. Bartholomew&#x27;s collection of Sassoon&#x27;s works, and some of his manuscripts, is now at Cambridge University Library in the collection of Geoffrey Keynes. In 1917 Bartholomew became friends with the American typographer Bruce Rogers, who had been employed by Cambridge University Press. Rogers went on to design Bartholomew&#x27;s bookplate along with several publications. Bartholomew also struck up a correspondence with Hilary Pepler (at the St Dominic&#x27;s Press), and encouraged him to send copies of his private press material to Cambridge University Library.

Bartholomew was exempted from military service during World War I by reason of his poor eyesight. During the chaotic war years, Bartholomew&#x27;s sane and precise habits became vital to the smooth functioning of the library. He provided much bibliographical structure for the &quot;Cambridge History of English Literature&quot;, edited by Sir Adolphus Ward and A. R. Waller.

==Literary work==

Bartholomew left behind him not only his considerable contributions to the life of the University Library, but also his literary research, of which the most significant were his involvement in editing the works of the Victorian novelist Samuel Butler (novelist), and the gathering together of material on the life and work of Frederick Rolfe). His work on Butler began in 1910, when he heard a paper on his life by Henry Festing Jones. The two soon became friends, a relationship which culminated in Bartholomew&#x27;s work on &quot;The Shrewsbury edition of the works of Samuel Butler&quot;, published in twenty volumes between 1923 and 1926. At Festing Jones&#x27; death in 1928, Butler&#x27;s literary executorship passed to Bartholomew.

His work on Frederick Rolfe had a somewhat less happy ending. In 1918 he set about gathering material for a possible biography of the eccentric author, who had died in Venice in 1913. He compiled a scrapbook of material from various sources, including Rolfe&#x27;s publisher Grant Richards, the uranian poet Horatio Brown (who had lived in Venice for much of his life) and Rolfe&#x27;s family. But A. J. A. Symons, founder of the First Edition Club, published a piece on Rolfe in 1926 which focused on the more scandalous aspects of his life, and for reasons which are unknown, Bartholomew eventually gave up on his projected biography. At Bartholomew&#x27;s death his precious scrapbook (now at the Harry Ransom Center in Texas) was lent to Symons, who used it extensively for his 1934 biography of Rolfe, entitled &quot;Quest for Corvo&quot;.

==Later life, and death==

In 1926, Bartholomew began to suffer from bouts of depression, which eventually developed into an all-consuming melancholy. This serious affliction was quite satisfactorily cured by a programme of psychological intervention, to which Bartholomew agreed on condition it did not alter his homosexuality. In the years left to him, Bartholomew applied his characteristic sense of cleanliness and order to his new home in Millington Road. He had inherited good taste in furniture from his family, who came from a long line of cabinet-makers (George Bartholomew &amp; Co. of Finsbury Pavement, London). To this he added his knowledge of books and prints, and with these he decorated his house (including his portrait, by John Wells, now hanging in the University Library), and so began to enjoy a well-deserved domestic comfort. His enjoyment was cut short; in 1932 he began to suffer from severe headaches, caused by high blood pressure. Within a year he was dead, at the age of 50. The task of writing Bartholomew&#x27;s obituary fell to Keynes, one of his executors (along with Brian Hill and W. J. H. Sprott) who wrote:

Bartholomew&#x27;s diaries (covering the period 1904 to 1925) are housed at Cambridge University Library (MS Add.8786/1/3-14), and he also appears frequently in the diaries of Charles Sayle (CUL MS Add.8501-8510). An article on Bartholomew appeared in the Autumn 2016 issue of &quot;The Book Collector.&quot;

<text>Papa is a 1996 South Korean television series that aired on KBS2 from January 3 to February 29, 1996 with a total of 18 episodes.

==Synopsis==
===Prologue===
The prologue of the story is not shown in the first episode, but is revealed through flashbacks in various parts of the drama series, notably when a character is thinking about his past experiences.

Choi Hyun-joon was a university student who met Han Se-yung and fell in love, during his years in a university. Se-yung became pregnant with Se-Byeol prior to their marriage. Their friend, Hye-min, was secretly in love with Choi and frequently met with Choi to assist his writing. Se-yung often saw the couple in intimate conversations sharing laughter etc., right until Hye-min decided to go to America to further her studies, due in part to relation problems which developed between Choi and Han. Han later decided to file a divorce with Choi shortly after.

===Episodes 1-8===
Hyun-joon, a university professor and a best-selling novelist, who is the father of a six-year-old daughter, lived with his two roommates who are his friend and ex-brother-in-law, Han In-pyo. Han In-pyo is a loafer who frequently hangs out with his girlfriends and squanders away his time at home on music, movies, and calling girlfriends. He came to live in Choi&#x27;s house immediately after his water supply was cut off while washing his face. In-pyo&#x27;s water supply and electricity were cut off for he had owed the electrical supply board a large sum of unpaid fees.

A conflict happened when In-pyo met Yong Gong, who also appeared after renting a room from Choi. He tried to punch Gong, as he (mistakenly) was angry at Gong for flirting with Se-yung at the bar, and letting her off altogether by boarding a taxi by herself. Se-yung was surprised to find Gong in Choi&#x27;s house as well as a son.

His friend, Yong Gong, was a widower who worked as a Chinese physician. His wife died the previous year (1995) after a car accident. Yong Gong also had a naughty and greedy son, Jae-hong. Yong Gong eventually fell in love with Yoon Hye-won, a pharmacist who doted on his son. They first met after Hye-won brought Jae-hung into her pharmacy as he ran, fell, and injured himself when he was following Hye-won doing exercises.

On the other hand, In-pyo, fells in love with a kindergarten teacher, who happened to be the teacher of the children of Hyun-joon and Yong Gong. They first met outside a fashion shop. In-pyo first attracted her attention by splashing a puddle of dirty water with his car onto her pants. They later met again while meeting Jee-yeong, and again at the kindergarten where his niece Se-Byeol and Jae-hung are students. At the kindergarten, In-pyo tried to attract her attention by criticizing her attitude and dress as a teacher from what he saw the previous day, in front of her colleagues. Han In-pyo felt jubilant after that, but the children protested by highlighting their risk of being transferred out to another school. The kids told their fathers of Han In-pyo&#x27;s conduct at the kindergarten, both of whom demanded him to apologize to the teacher.

In-pyo apologized to the teacher the following day. Hee-ju disguised herself as another individual when In-pyo came in, who presented an apple. Shortly after In-pyo left the kindergarten, Hee-ju followed suit and proceeded to her car, where her chauffeur, Mr Wang, was waiting for her. Hee-ju requested to drive towards In-pyo short of crashing into him. Hee-ju lowered her spectacles and apologized after doing so. As Wang drove off, a jubilant Hee-ju gave a bite on the apple In-pyo gave. In-pyo himself was smiling as well. He subsequently frequently visited the kindergarten, even during lesson time, and spent time eating and shopping with Hee-ju.

===Episode 9-18===
As time progressed, the three men&#x27;s affairs with women also progressed, but complications arose as Yong-min tried to balance his relations between Hye-min and Se-young. This happened when Hee-min had just returned from America to Korea, and frequented the university Choi was teaching in and his house. In-pyo also had a hard time getting approval from Hee-ju&#x27;s father and elder brother for their relationship.

However, after deliberations and persuasion by his son, he approved at episode 17, on condition that In-pyo would agree to change his course of study to a new course that could assist his company. Hee-ju&#x27;s father also warned In-pyo that he would only allow the couple to marry after three years, and they would have to break up if his behavior changed for the worse.

After sending Hee-min to America with the termination of their relations and Se-young shaking off her relationship with her boss, Kang Dong-Seok, Hyun-joon eventually reconciled with his ex-wife Se-young after a separation of many years. Se-young is working in a film production company, under Kang, to create the film &quot;Salut D&#x27;Amour&quot;.

Yong Gong got to marry the pharmacist who lived with his entire family and Hyun-joon&#x27;s brother-in-law eventually went abroad to America to study, as a promise to marry Hee-ju if both of them excel academically.

Se-young and Hyun-joon confessed their feelings towards each other after Hyun-joon broke up with Hye-min, who had already returned to America to further her studies for another three years. At this time, Yong Gong married the pharmacist, Hye-won after dating indirectly for sometime as well as pressure applied by his son. Yong Gong had confessed his love to Hye-won in episode 17 at her pharmacy shortly after she wound up for the day. That was the same time Hye-won was introduced to a blind date through her father.

The duo later met again at the KBS radio station where Choi worked. The duo then hugged each other after confessing their needs to each other.

== Trivia ==
* Bae, as Choi Hyun-joon in &quot;Papa&quot; was the author of the Korean version of &quot;Salut D&#x27;Amour&quot;. The content described in &quot;Papa&quot; strongly corresponds to the story in this drama. This is evidenced in one scenario in episode three, Choi (Bae) was having a grand meeting on his third fiction book. The Korean words &quot;사랑의 인사&quot; were written on the display signboard for the meeting. Bae starred as Kim Yong-min in &quot;Salut D&#x27;Amour&quot;.
* The lyrics of the theme song contain a humorous &quot;Por Por Por...&quot; rhythm, a form of a human mimic of the car horn. It can be heard after the words &quot;차윤 데 나지만! (jayun de nachiman!)&quot;

<text>Raul Sevilla Manglapus (October 20, 1918 – July 25, 1999) was a prominent post–World War II Filipino politician and songwriter. He co-founded the reformist Progressive Party of the Philippines and the Christian Democratic Socialist Movement in 1968 (later renamed the National Union of Christian Democrats).

He was elected to the Senate by a landslide in 1961 and ran for president in 1965, but lost to eventual winner Ferdinand Marcos. He once again became Secretary of Foreign Affairs under President Corazon Aquino in 1987.

His name is inscribed on the wall of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the heroes and martyrs who fought authoritarian rule. However, Manglapus has also drawn the ire of feminist movements for his preconceived notions and controversial sexist remarks during his lifetime.

==Personal life==
He was married to Pacita La&#x27;O. His father was Congressman Valentin Manglapus of Ilocos Sur, and his mother was Justina Sevilla of Malabon, Rizal.

==Early life==
Manglapus spent his formative years in the Ateneo de Manila. In 1939, he served as editor-in-chief of the school publication, The Guidon. It was during this time that he was acquainted with Manuel Manahan, rural reform advocate and later colleague in the Senate. In fact, Manahan served as editor-in-chief of the Guidon before Manglapus. The two became long-time friends and were later running-mates for the 1965 Presidential Elections under the Party for Philippine Progress (PPP). Manglapus graduated from the Ateneo de Manila AB &#x27;39 &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and excelled in oratory. His prize-winning oration, &quot;In Defense of the &quot;Tao&quot;&quot;, (the Common Man), capped extraordinary scholastic achievements which earned him the respect of President Manuel L. Quezon who attended the contest for the sole purpose of hearing Manglapus speak.

During World War II Manglapus was the voice in the &quot;Voice of Freedom&quot; broadcasts from the beleaguered Filipino-American forces on Bataan and Corregidor, serving under Gen. Douglas MacArthur. He was tortured to the brink of death by the Japanese in Fort Santiago. He was a member of the Philippine delegation who witnessed the signing of the Instrument of Surrender by the Japanese on board the on 2 September 1945.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
He first came to prominence from his association with Ramon Magsaysay, the one-time mechanic turned populist President of the Philippines. In 1953, Manglapus composed for the presidential candidate Magsaysay the catchy campaign jingle &quot;Mambo Magsaysay&quot;, which became widely popular and was credited in some quarters as aiding immensely in the election of Magsaysay.

Manglapus remained, until the end of his life, a prolific composer and musical performer. His compositions, distinctive for their martial lilt, included, besides, a college rallying march, &quot;Blue Eagle the King&quot;, whose music were later borrowed and adapted by a Jesuit school in the United States.

He was also the leader of the Executive Combo Band, a jazz band composed mainly of his peers which performed for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1995. He jammed with jazz giant Duke Ellington, and prominent jazz-inclined politicians such as U.S. President Bill Clinton, Amelita Ramos—wife of President Fidel V. Ramos, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. Later in life, Manglapus would serve as chairman of the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (FILSCAP).

A linguist and a snappy dresser, he sometimes conveyed the persona of an upstart elitist, further highlighted by his fluent American-tinged accent hallmarked by his education at the Ateneo de Manila, which awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1965. The lack of a traditional political machinery to support him contributed to early electoral defeats. He also did not have plenty of allies, often distancing himself from other senators due to his elitist personality, though this did not prevent him from cooperating with them in his post-Martial Law career. Nonetheless, by the time of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, he had attained prominence and stability in the Filipino political arena.

===During martial law===
Manglapus was on a speaking engagement in the United States when Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Marcos refused to allow his wife and children to join him in exile, and they were forced to flee the country by through a complicated route, leapfrogging even by small raft to freedom. 

Manglapus remained in exile for 14 years, dissuaded by an outstanding warrant of arrest should he return to the country. Even in exile, Manglapus remained as one of the Filipino opposition leaders after Benigno Aquino Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose W. Diokno. 

During his years as an expatriate, Manglapus founded the Movement for a Free Philippines (MFP). In July 1974, his musical comedy &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; was first staged in Honolulu, Hawaii. He served as president of Democracy International, an organization of exiled world leaders seeking the restoration of democratic institutions in their respective countries, and president of the Washington-based International Center for Development Policy from 1981 to 1986. 

In an interview in March 1981, he voiced his strong revulsion of Marcos&#x27; violation of the Constitution and his manipulation of the political scene as a ploy to the declaration of martial law as a means to entrench himself and his cronies:

&quot;&quot;Martial law pure and simple has been a facade masking the exploitation of our people and their natural resources by Marcos, his family and close friends. Any benefits, and there have been few, that have reached the people have been accidental and not the result of deliberate martial law policy&quot;.&quot;

===Return to the Philippines===

Manglapus immediately returned to the Philippines upon the ouster of Marcos and the accession to the presidency of Corazon Aquino in 1986. He was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1987, but resigned before his term expired to serve once again as Secretary of Foreign Affairs for President Aquino.

A longtime critic of the American military presence, he pressed for a considerable increase in U.S. military aid and general economic assistance in exchange for extending the operations of U.S. military bases in the country, signing compromise agreements in this effort with the United States that was later rejected by the Philippine Senate in 1991, which resulted in the U.S. military pulling out by the end of 1992. He also courted controversy after a remark he made during a Senate hearing on the rape of Filipina domestic workers during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He quipped, to general outrage, that if rape were inevitable, one should relax and enjoy it. Despite the subsequent political firestorm, Manglapus weathered widespread calls for his resignation.

After the election of his close associate Fidel V. Ramos as president in 1992, Manglapus lowered his political profile, while retaining powerful positions such as chairman of the Philippine National Oil Company and the Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD), Ramos&#x27; political party. Manglapus had established the Christian Democratic Socialist Movement in 1968, a party which eventually reorganized as the NUCD. Manglapus fostered ties with the other Christian Democratic parties in the world, such as that in Germany.

As senator and government official, he promoted land reform and battled corruption. He was also a foremost nationalist and human rights advocate. Commenting on his unsuccessful bid for the presidency, a writer wrote: &quot;&quot;Raúl Manglapus was one of the leading Filipino intellectuals of his generation and a politician with wide appeal. It was the Philippines&#x27; misfortune that Ferdinand Marcos, equally able but lacking in principles, won the presidency rather than someone like Manglapus.

==Death==
Manglapus died on July 25, 1999, from throat cancer.

<doc id="1301423" wikidata="Q2337380" url="?curid=1301423" title="David Harrison (basketball)">
<text>David Joshua Harrison (born August 15, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. A former National Basketball Association (NBA) player for the Indiana Pacers, he was a member of the Beijing Ducks for the 2008–09 season and played with the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the next two years. He also played for the Tianjin Ronggang. At Brentwood Academy, Harrison received TSSAA Division 2 Mr. Basketball in 2000 and 2001. He was drafted by the Indiana Pacers out of the University of Colorado at Boulder with the 29th pick of the 2004 NBA draft.

==College career==
In college, he was named First Team All-Big 12 and earned Honorable Mention All-America honors by the Associated Press as a junior. He finished his college career as Colorado&#x27;s all-time leading shot-blocker with 225 blocks.

==NBA career==
Harrison was drafted 29th overall in the 2004 NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers. Harrison was expected to be the #2 or maybe even #3 center in the Pacers&#x27; depth chart for his rookie year of 2004–05, behind Jeff Foster and Scot Pollard. However, due to injuries to Pollard and the suspensions of Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, Stephen Jackson and Ron Artest, he became a starter at a much earlier part of his career than most people anticipated. He ended up starting 14 of the 43 games he played in his rookie season, before missing the final two months due to injury.

Harrison was charged with one count of assault and battery for his involvement in the Pacers–Pistons brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004, though he was not penalized by the league for the incident.

In his sophomore season of 2005–06 with the Pacers, Harrison played in 67 games, starting 17 of them, playing an average of 15.4 minutes and contributing 5.7 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.

In 2008, the Pacers suspended Harrison for one game following an incident in which Harrison expressed his frustration inside the San Antonio Spurs&#x27; locker room after Spurs forward Matt Bonner hit him in the face (Bonner was called for an offensive foul). In Harrison&#x27;s first game back from the suspension he had 4 points, 6 rebounds and a career high 6 blocks in just 20 minutes of play.

The Indiana Pacers chose not to re-sign Harrison after his contract expired at the end of the 2007–08 season. The Minnesota Timberwolves signed him to their practice squad for the preseason, but he was waived before the 2008–09 regular season began.

==Off-court struggles==
In an interview, Harrison admitted to smoking marijuana in the offseasons. However, his habit carried into the regular season in 2007–2008, and because of this, he was suspended five games. Since leaving the NBA, Harrison has struggled with financial issues.

==Post-NBA career==
After leaving the Indiana Pacers after the 2007–2008 season, Harrison played basketball in China for three seasons. In the 2011–2012 season, he played for the NBA D-League team Reno Bighorns. In 2012, he also played for the Dallas Mavericks summer league team. After struggling with financial problems, Harrison took a job at McDonald&#x27;s in August 2013. However, he left his position after two weeks. Currently, Harrison trades stocks in order to provide for his family. Harrison also has a small mobile game application company, Kage Media Groups LLC, but he lacks the funding to make this a profitable means for him and his family.

==Return to professional basketball==
On September 14, 2015, Harrison decided to return to basketball and signed with the Las Vegas Dealers of the upcoming AmeriLeague. However, the league folded after it was discovered the founder was a con-artist.

==Personal life==
Harrison currently resides in Indianapolis with his girlfriend and infant son.

<text>Wood–plastic composites (WPCs)
are composite materials made of wood fiber/wood flour and thermoplastic(s) such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polylactic acid (PLA).

In addition to wood fiber and plastic, WPCs can also contain other ligno-cellulosic and/or inorganic filler materials. WPCs are a subset of a larger category of materials called natural fiber plastic composites (NFPCs), which may contain no cellulose-based fiber fillers such as pulp fibers, peanut hulls, coffee husk, bamboo, straw, digestate, etc.

Chemical additives provide for integration of polymer and wood flour (powder) while facilitating optimal processing conditions.

==History==
The company that invented and patented the process to create WPC was Covema of Milan in 1960, founded by Terragni brothers (Dino and Marco). Covema made WPC under the tradename Plastic-Wood. After a few years from the invention of the Plastic-Wood the company Icma San Giorgio patented the first process to add wood fiber/wood flour to the thermoplastics (WPCs).

== Uses ==
Also sometimes known as composite timber, WPCs are still new materials relative to the long history of natural lumber as a building material. The most widespread use of WPCs in North America is in outdoor deck floors, but it is also used for railings, fences, landscaping timbers, cladding and siding, park benches, molding and trim, prefab houses under the tradename Woodpecker WPC, window and door frames, and indoor furniture. WPCs were first introduced into the decking market in the early 1990s. Manufacturers claim that WPC is more environmentally friendly and requires less maintenance than the alternatives of solid wood treated with preservatives or solid wood of rot-resistant species. These materials can be molded with or without simulated wood grain details.

== Production ==

WPCs are produced by thoroughly mixing ground wood particles and heated thermoplastic resin. The most common method of production is to extrude the material into the desired shape, though injection molding is also used. WPCs may be produced from either virgin or recycled thermoplastics including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS), and polylactic acid (PLA). PE-based WPCs are by far the most common. Additives such as colorants, coupling agents, UV stabilizers, blowing agents, foaming agents, and lubricants help tailor the end product to the target area of application. Extruded WPCs are formed into both solid and hollow profiles. A large variety of injection molded parts are also produced, from automotive door panels to cell phone covers.

In some manufacturing facilities, the constituents are combined and processed in a pelletizing extruder, which produces pellets of the new material. The pellets are then re-melted and formed into the final shape. Other manufacturers complete the finished part in a single step of mixing and extrusion.

Due to the addition of organic material, WPCs are usually processed at far lower temperatures than traditional plastics during extrusion and injection molding. WPCs tend to process at temperatures of about lower than the same, unfilled material, for instance. Most will begin to burn at temperatures around . Processing WPCs at excessively high temperatures increases the risk of shearing, or burning and discoloration resulting from pushing a material that is too hot through a gate which is too small, during injection molding. The ratio of wood to plastic in the composite will ultimately determine the melt flow index (MFI) of the WPC, with larger amounts of wood generally leading to a lower MFI.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

WPCs do not corrode and are highly resistant to rot, decay, and marine borer attack, though they do absorb water into the wood fibers embedded within the material. Water absorption is more pronounced in WFCs with a hydrophilic matrix such as PLA and also leads to decreased mechanical stiffness and strength. The mechanical performance in a wet environment can be enhanced by an acetylation treatment. WPCs have good workability and can be shaped using conventional woodworking tools. WPCs are often considered a sustainable material because they can be made using recycled plastics and the waste products of the wood industry. Although these materials continue the lifespan of used and discarded materials, they have their own considerable half life; the polymers and adhesives added make WPC difficult to recycle again after use. They can however be recycled easily in a new WPC, much like concrete. One advantage over wood is the ability of the material to be molded to meet almost any desired shape. A WPC member can be bent and fixed to form strong arching curves. Another major selling point of these materials is their lack of need for paint. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, but are widely available in grays and earth tones. Despite up to 70 percent cellulose content (although 50/50 is more common), the mechanical behavior of WPCs is most similar to neat polymers. Neat polymers are polymerized without added solvents. This means that WPCs have a lower strength and stiffness than wood, and they experience time and temperature-dependent behavior. The wood particles are susceptible to fungal attack, though not as much so as solid wood, and the polymer component is vulnerable to UV degradation. It is possible that the strength and stiffness may be reduced by freeze-thaw cycling, though testing is still being conducted in this area. Some WPC formulations are sensitive to staining from a variety of agents.

== WPC sandwich boards ==
WPC boards show a good set of performance but monolithic composite sheets are relatively heavy (most often heavier than pure plastics) which limits their use to applications where low weight is not essential. WPC in a sandwich-structured composite form allows for a combination of the benefits of traditional wood polymer composites with the lightness of a sandwich panel technology. WPC sandwich boards consist of wood polymer composite skins and usually low-density polymer core which leads to a very effective increase of panel&#x27;s rigidity. WPC sandwich boards are used mainly in automotive, transportation and building applications, but furniture applications are also being developed. New efficient and often in-line integrated production processes allow to produce stronger and stiffer WPC sandwich boards at lower costs compared to traditional plastic sheets or monolithic WPC panels.

==Issues==
===Environmental impact===
The environmental impact of WPCs is directly affected by the ratio of renewable to non-renewable materials. The commonly used petroleum-based polymers have a negative environmental impact because they rely on non-renewable raw materials and the non-biodegradability of plastics.

=== Fire hazards ===
The types of plastic normally used in WPC formulations have higher fire hazard properties than wood alone, as plastic has a higher chemical heat content and can melt. The inclusion of plastic as a portion of the composite results in the potential for higher fire hazards in WPCs as compared with wood. Some code officials are becoming increasingly concerned with the fire performance of WPCs.

<doc id="1301427" wikidata="Q7071272" url="?curid=1301427" title="Nyssa (Doctor Who)">
<text>Nyssa is a fictional character in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She is played by Sarah Sutton. Although Nyssa was created by writer Johnny Byrne for the single Fourth Doctor serial &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;, the production team subsequently decided she should be retained as a continuing character. Nyssa returned in the following serial, &quot;Logopolis&quot;, in which the Fourth Doctor regenerated, and remained as a companion of the Fifth Doctor. She was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1983.

==Character history==

Nyssa is an aristocrat of Traken, the daughter of Tremas (a consul of the Traken Union) and stepdaughter of Kassia. She aids the Doctor and Adric when the Master wrests control of the Keepership by first manipulating and then murdering her stepmother, but is herself hypnotised and kidnapped by him after he takes control of her father&#x27;s body. After being freed from the Master&#x27;s control, she is brought to Logopolis by the Watcher and discovers that Traken has been destroyed as a side effect of the Master&#x27;s tampering with the Logopolitan&#x27;s formulae. She subsequently joins Adric and Tegan Jovanka as a companion and member of the TARDIS crew, and witnesses the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration into the Fifth.

During her journeys with Tegan and Adric aboard the TARDIS, Nyssa finds herself trapped in a mathematical equation by the Master – whom she hates as he is now using her father&#x27;s face. She also encounters a race of androids and their insane ruler, helps foil the genocidal plans of a wounded Terileptil and incidentally starts the Great Fire of London, and discovers her uncanny resemblance to a 1920s English socialite Ann Talbot.

Adric&#x27;s death while battling the Cybermen affects the TARDIS crew deeply. When confronted by an illusion of him created by the Master shortly afterwards, both Nyssa and Tegan are initially taken aback, until Nyssa notices Adric is still wearing his now-destroyed badge. During this adventure, Nyssa also displays a previously unseen psychic ability when she is contacted by the Xeraphin.

After Tegan is accidentally left at Heathrow at the end of the events in &quot;Time Flight&quot;, Nyssa travels alone with the Doctor for an unspecified period.

Nyssa and the Doctor are reunited with Tegan while fighting Omega in Amsterdam and on Gallifrey. Later, they help Tegan battle her inner demons (personified by the Mara), and in the events of &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; they meet the Doctor&#x27;s old friend and ally Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. It is during this adventure that the TARDIS crew adopts Turlough, an alien posing as a pupil at an English boarding school, who has secretly entered into a bargain with the Black Guardian to assassinate the Doctor. His interference with the TARDIS infrastructure destabilises it and it locks onto a seemingly derelict space station, Terminus, separating Nyssa from the others. Nyssa&#x27;s adventures with the Doctor come to an end here, as – to Tegan&#x27;s horror – she elects to stay to help free the enslaved guards and turn the station into a real hospital. The Doctor is moved by this noble gesture and parts saying that he thinks she is very brave. Nyssa&#x27;s deep affection for the Doctor is demonstrated at this point when she kisses the Doctor goodbye.

The Fifth Doctor hallucinates Nyssa warning him not to die during his regeneration at the end of &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; and the character appears alongside the Fifth Doctor and Peri Brown in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;.

Nyssa is last mentioned by the Tenth Doctor in the 2007 Children in Need episode &quot;Time Crash&quot; when he asks his Fifth incarnation where he is in his own relative timeline.

A 2020 short published to the official Doctor Who YouTube channel and titled &quot;Farewell, Sarah Jane&quot;, written by former Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies, revealed that Nyssa was in a relationship with fellow traveler Tegan Jovanka.

==Appearances in other media==
Although Nyssa&#x27;s fate after the TARDIS is not certain, the spin-off novel &quot;Asylum&quot; by Peter Darvill-Evans, relates that she left Terminus and settled down as an academic in a university on an unspecified planet. In &quot;Asylum&quot;, Nyssa encounters the Fourth Doctor from a time before he met her while he is investigating a historical anomaly. This meeting leaves the Doctor with the knowledge that he will have to be extremely careful dealing with Nyssa when he eventually meets her younger self to avoid changing history.

Since then Nyssa has appeared in several audio plays, still voiced by Sarah Sutton alongside Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor, produced by Big Finish Productions. &quot;Primeval&quot;, set in Traken&#x27;s past, provides an explanation for Nyssa&#x27;s sudden collapse at the end of &quot;Four to Doomsday&quot; and her apparent development of psychic abilities in &quot;Time-Flight&quot;, as she was manipulated by an ancient entity that ruled Traken in the distant past as part of a complex plan to trick the Doctor into giving him access to the Source. Other stories in this time frame include new temporary companions Thomas Brewster and Hannah Bartholemew. The &#x27;Winter&#x27; segment of &quot;Circular Time&quot;, by Paul Cornell and Mike Maddox, is set some years after &quot;Asylum&quot; and shows her with a husband, Lasarti, and a baby daughter, Nica. In &quot;Heroes of Sontar&quot;, Nyssa tells Tegan that she has two children named Adric and Tegan (although it is later confirmed that she mis-identified her daughter&#x27;s name as she was delirious due to infection with a biological weapon).

When she sees the regenerating Fifth Doctor in her dreams and believes this may be the last time she sees him, Nyssa accepts that he is still travelling and having adventures somewhere. However, fifty years after leaving them, Nyssa meets the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough (a short while after they left her from their perspective) in &quot;Cobwebs&quot;. She begins travelling with them again to research a cure for a lethal plague, which was deliberately engineered to be more dangerous so that a corporation could provide the engineered cure; a chain of events leave Nyssa with a valid sample of the cure for the virus in its early stages, but this sample will not treat the mutated strain that is currently active in her time over twenty years later. In the course of her travels Nyssa is physically de-aged back to the same age she was when she originally left the crew (&quot;The Emerald Tiger&quot;). In &quot;Prisoners of Fate&quot;, the TARDIS is drawn to a planet where the Doctor&#x27;s original TARDIS (the Type 50 he owned on Gallifrey before he stole the familiar Type 40 on impulse to leave the planet) has crash-landed, and the crew end up meeting Nyssa&#x27;s son, Adric, over two decades after Nyssa resumed her travels with the Doctor, preventing her from simply picking up her life once again now that she knows she &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; go back. Nyssa and her son are able to combine their research to cure the plague, with Nyssa&#x27;s cure for the original disease being mapped onto the research Adric has undertaken of how the virus subsequently mutated, but Nyssa is prevented from reuniting with Adric when the TARDIS is caught in a CVE while en route to the next planet and is sent back to E-space. Nyssa ultimately sacrifices her own chance to escape so that her fellow travelers can return home, remaining in E-Space to power the equipment needed to open a final portal back to N-Space that the TARDIS can travel through. The audio ends with Nyssa, now an old woman, tending a garden in E-Space after spending the last decade teaching others how to treat the sick, observing that E-Space is showing new signs of life after the Doctor expressed concern that this world would only have a few centuries of life left.

Nyssa appears in the Short Trips audio &quot;A Heart on Both Sides&quot;, where she is depicted running a medical ship during the Time War, unknowingly aided in her efforts by the Eighth Doctor (who assists Nyssa under the alias of &#x27;Doctor Foster&#x27; to avert a rumour he heard in the future of a ship matching the description of Nyssa&#x27;s being destroyed).

<text>Lincoln Brewster (born July 30, 1971) is an American contemporary Christian musician and worship pastor. As a guitarist, singer, and songwriter, Brewster became a sought-after session guitarist in the early 1990s. Brewster is the former senior worship pastor at Bayside Church in Granite Bay, California.

==Biography==
Brewster has been musically inclined since his early childhood in Homer, Alaska. At the age of one, his mother, Cheryl, noticed how well he could keep rhythm on a drum set his grandfather had given him. At the age of five, his mother introduced him to the mandolin. Quickly mastering the instrument, he began playing for cruise ship tourists alongside his mother in Homer. Brewster&#x27;s step brothers include John and Andy Hillstrand from the Discovery channel TV show &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;.

By the age of 12, Brewster had a band called &quot;Lincoln and the Missing Links&quot;, which included his mother on bass and vocals. In his late teens, he moved with his family to Modesto, California, where he attended Grace M. Davis High School and joined the high school jazz band (playing guitar and drums) and marching band (playing snare drum).

Due to connections gained in Los Angeles, he had recording contract offers by 19. Feeling an emptiness in his life, Brewster attended church services with his girlfriend, Laura. He recalls feeling God drawing him close after attending a drama ministry performance with Laura. &quot;I was afraid to lay down a lot of things in my life,&quot; Brewster said. &quot;One night, I laid all my cards on the table. I asked the Lord to come into my life, all by myself. It was the best night of sleep I&#x27;d ever had. I was very peaceful. I think that was what enabled me to blow off that record deal.&quot;

After receiving a call from Steve Perry inviting him to audition as lead guitarist for his solo project &quot;For the Love of Strange Medicine&quot;, Brewster accepted and began songwriting and rehearsals for the album. Brewster&#x27;s guitar technique, tone, and equipment choices possessed similar qualities and texturing to Journey&#x27;s Neal Schon, and was touted as a favorable feature in the resulting album. He was then married to Laura and soon after toured with Perry for six months from 1994 to early 1995.

At the end of the tour, Brewster moved back to Modesto, California to be with his wife where they attended Calvary Temple Church. After working as a sound technician for the church for a while, the senior pastor offered Brewster the position of associate music director and youth worship leader.

In 1997, the Brewsters moved to Nashville to serve as youth pastors and eventually as full-time music ministers at The Oasis Church. There, Brewster met with executives from Integrity Incorporated who were working on a new &quot;Hosanna! Music&quot; album. After seeing his guitar-playing ability, one executive listened to a demo project Brewster had produced. Already impressed with the production work and artistry, the executive also learned that Brewster had played every instrument and performed all the vocals himself. In 2001, Brewster moved back to California to become the worship pastor at Bayside Church in Granite Bay.

Brewster was signed to Integrity&#x27;s Vertical Music label with whom he has released five full-length albums.

While working on his self-titled album (with producer Paul Mills), Brewster worked with label-mate Darrell Evans, contributing vocals, guitar, and co-writing on Evans&#x27; &quot;Freedom&quot; project. He also spent some time touring with Michael W. Smith during Smith&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Live the Life&quot; tour. Brewster&#x27;s second album, &quot;Live to Worship&quot; (produced by Jeff Quimby and co-produced by Brewster), was released in 2000. According to his biography on his official website, &quot;Lincoln now combines his talents and determination to record songs that will minister to a new generation of believers.&quot;

Brewster&#x27;s album, &quot;Today Is the Day&quot;, was released on September 23, 2008. The album&#x27;s first released single, was the title track &quot;Today Is the Day&quot;.

On September 22, 2009, Brewster released a deluxe edition of &quot;Today Is the Day&quot; consisting of a CD with the same songs as &quot;Today Is the Day&quot; as well as a DVD containing two music videos, a few song stories, and a part of his instructional video.

Brewster released his latest project, &quot;Real Life&quot;, on September 28, 2010. The record features upbeat, contemporary worship tracks such as &quot;Best Days&quot; and the optimistic &quot;Reaching For You&quot;. It also includes contemplative radio-ready songs such as the title track &quot;Real Life&quot;, and the rhythmic &quot;Whom Shall I Fear&quot;.

In 2012, Brewster released his first Christmas album, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. A deluxe edition was released on November 5, 2013, with seven new tracks and an additional DVD.
In 2014 Brewster released &quot;Oxygen&quot;, his ninth studio album after signing with Integrity Music after 15 years. He called the album a &quot;new sound&quot;, which explained the album&#x27;s high sense of modern pop music with of course a lot of guitar riffs and solos.

In 2015, Lincoln Brewster released his first rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as a surprise on the USA&#x27;s Independence Day holiday. He was a part of the Winter Jam Tour 2015 West Coast.

His most recent releases include &quot;God of the Impossible&quot; in 2018, &quot;A Mostly Acoustic Christmas&quot; in 2019, and &quot;Perfect Love&quot; in 2021.

==Equipment==
Brewster primarily uses two different 1957 specification reissue Fender Stratocasters with DiMarzio pickups, one with Aztec Gold finish the other on a pearl Olympic white finish both on with an Ash bodies, both with maple fingerboards and necks. They have vintage looking tuners that are actually locking and a special active mid-boost circuit so that the single coil pickups can be made to sounds more like PAF humbuckers. Fender released his Artist signature model Stratocaster in August 2019.

Brewster achieves his live tone solely from a Line 6 POD HD500 unit. He occasionally uses a provided amp for stage noise only and goes direct to the PA system with the floor POD.

Brewster also uses a Kemper profiling amplifier live and in his home studio. He recently stated in a live Facebook video that he recorded &quot;No One Like Our God (One Take)&quot; on the Line 6 Helix Native program directly from his guitar.

<text>Edward Selig Salomon (December 25, 1836 – July 18, 1913) was a German-American politician and military official. Born into a Jewish family in the Duchy of Schleswig in modern-day Germany, he immigrated to the United States as a young adult and served as a lieutenant colonel for the Union during the American Civil War. After nomination for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, by President Andrew Johnson on January 13, 1866, the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866. Salomon later held public office as Cook County (Illinois) clerk, governor of Washington Territory and a California legislator.

==Early life and career==
Salomon, who was Jewish, was born in the Duchy of Schleswig, the son of Caroline (Samuels) and Salomon M. Salomon. He emigrated to Illinois in 1856. His cousin Edward Salomon, who also served as a general in the Civil War, later became Governor of Wisconsin.

==Civil War==
===Military===
In July 1861, Salomon was commissioned as a first lieutenant in Colonel Friedrich Hecker&#x27;s 24th Illinois Infantry Regiment. Disagreements arose between Hecker and some of his officers, after which Hecker and his supporters resigned, including Salomon. Salomon became a civilian again from December 1861 to September 1862. In August 1862, Hecker formed a new regiment, the 82nd Illinois Infantry, or the &quot;Second Hecker Regiment&quot;, composed mainly of German, Jewish, Swedish, and other European volunteers. Salomon joined and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on September 26, 1862.

Salomon became a hero during the Battle of Gettysburg. He had two horses shot out from under him and assumed command of the regiment when Hecker was wounded. Fellow-immigrant major general Carl Schurz, his corps commander, described him during the battle: &quot;He was the only soldier at Gettysburg who did not dodge when Lee&#x27;s guns thundered; he stood up, smoked his cigar and faced the cannon balls with the sang froid of a Saladin ...&quot;

Early in 1864, Hecker resigned, leaving Salomon in permanent command of the regiment, although still as a lieutenant colonel. Salomon led the regiment during the Atlanta Campaign and through the capture of Atlanta. Assigned to deliver messages to Nashville, he missed the famous march to the sea. In December 1864, he rejoined the regiment and finished out the war with them. On March 13, 1865, Salomon received a promotion to brigadier general on for his “distinguished gallantry and meritorious service.”

On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Salomon for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.

===Chicago City Council===
In March 1861, Salomon was elected an alderman of the Chicago Common Council, representing the 6th ward. Being only 24 years old, he remains the youngest in Chicago history, He served until 1863. 

On March 23, 1863, Salomon made a surprise return visit to Chicago from the in order to attend a council meeting. This maneuver helped give the council&#x27;s Republican bloc an effective majority in votes at the meeting.

==Postbellum activities==
After the war, Salomon returned to Chicago where he was elected Cook County Clerk as a Republican in the fall of 1865, serving until November 1869.

On March 4, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Salomon governor of Washington Territory. He was caught up in the political scandals of the Grant administration and resigned in 1872. The &quot;Pacific Tribune&quot; newspaper, commenting on his resignation, lauded his honesty and integrity. General Philip Sheridan led a delegation that presented him with a silver table service in recognition of his fine record of service, high qualities as a citizen, and as a friend.

Salomon moved to San Francisco, where he practiced law. In 1898 Salomon was appointed assistant district attorney for the city and county. He was elected to the California State Assembly in 1890.

Salomon died in San Francisco on July 18, 1913, and is buried in Salem Memorial Park, Colma, California.

<doc id="1301436" wikidata="Q4727808" url="?curid=1301436" title="All-Bran">
<text>All-Bran is a high-bran, high-fibre, wheat bran breakfast cereal manufactured by WK Kellogg Co for the North American market and Kellanova for the rest of the world. It is marketed as an aid to digestive health.

==History==
The introduction of All-Bran in 1916 came on the heels of the success of Kellogg&#x27;s Bran Flakes a year earlier. It was sold in a red and green box, similar to most Kellogg&#x27;s cereals at the time. After finding great success in the U.S. market, Kellogg&#x27;s began distribution in the United Kingdom and other markets in 1922.

==Advertising==

With the rising popularity of patent medicine in advertising, The Kellogg Company of Canada published a book named &quot;A New Way of Living&quot; that would show readers &quot;how to achieve a new way of living; how to preserve vitality; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it.&quot; It touted the All-Bran cereal as the secret to leading &quot;normal&quot; lives free of constipation.

==Ingredients==

The current ingredients of All-Bran Original are wheat bran, sugar, corn and barley malt extract, salt, and the following added vitamins and minerals: iron, thiamine hydrochloride (vitamin B1), d-calcium pantothenate (vitamin B5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), and folic acid.

It contains 33% fiber, 78% of natural wheat bran&#x27;s 43%. The second highest ingredient, after wheat bran, is sugar (18%).

All-Bran Buds is similar with added psyllium; its 39% fiber analysis is close to that of natural wheat bran.

Despite the name, the principal ingredient in All-Bran Flakes is whole grain wheat, not bran. It contains only 15% fiber, equivalent to 34% wheat bran.

All-Bran received five stars out of five on the Australian Government&#x27;s health star ratings.

<doc id="1301442" wikidata="Q4933035" url="?curid=1301442" title="Bob Kingsley">
<text>Robert Gibson Kingsley (March 19, 1939 – October 17, 2019) was an American country music radio personality and a member of the National Radio Hall of Fame. He was best known as the host of two nationally syndicated radio programs: &quot;American Country Countdown&quot; (&quot;ACC&quot;) and &quot;Bob Kingsley&#x27;s Country Top 40&quot;.

Kingsley first worked on the radio while stationed in Iceland with the United States Air Force. He worked as a disc jockey and program director for country music stations in the 1960s and early 1970s. Kingsley became a producer of &quot;ACC&quot; in 1974 and hosted it from 1978 to 2005, and then, with his wife Nan, produced &quot;Bob Kingsley&#x27;s Country Top 40&quot; from 2006 until his death.

==Early life==
Kingsley came down with polio when he was a school-aged child, and he enjoyed listening to the radio while he recovered: &quot;That&#x27;s all I had was that radio there. I could move my arm, my hand, just enough to turn the dial... The soap opera stuff during the day I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of, but in the evening when &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; and &quot;The Fat Man&quot; and all those great old radio shows were on... I was – what, six or seven – and it stayed with me.&quot;

==Early career==
While serving with the United States Air Force in 1959, Kingsley began his radio career at TFK, the Armed Forces Radio Service station in Keflavik, Iceland. He struggled at first. &quot;I murdered the copy, absolutely murdered it. I&#x27;ll never forget it. I wasn&#x27;t very good, but I was hooked,&quot; Kingsley said many years later.

After leaving the military, Kingsley went looking for radio jobs, carrying demo tapes that he had made with an old tape recorder. After a DJ friend told him he needed a better demo tape and gave him access to a studio to record one, Kingsley found a sales job at a radio station in Palmdale, California. The station went off the air in the evenings, and they let Kingsley practice in the studio after he finished his work for the day. Kingsley said that he only sold commercials to one account in the six months he worked there. He jocked at Los Angeles country station KGBS for a few years, and then in 1970 became program director at KLAC, which had just dropped middle of the road (MOR) music for a country format.

==&quot;American Country Countdown&quot;==
Kingsley rose to national prominence in 1974 when he became the producer of the nationally syndicated &quot;American Country Countdown&quot; (&quot;ACC&quot;). Tom Rounds, a radio executive with Watermark Inc., created &quot;ACC&quot; as a country music version of Casey Kasem&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot;, and Rounds had gotten Kingsley&#x27;s name by word of mouth.

Kingsley succeeded the program&#x27;s original host, Don Bowman, beginning in May 1978. Concurrently, Kingsley was providing voiceovers for Drake-Chenault Enterprises and its automated country music programming service. Under Kingsley&#x27;s watch, &quot;ACC&quot; won &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Network/Syndicated Program of the Year: Country&quot; 16 years in a row, the only on-air personality and music program in any format to achieve this continued success. 

==&quot;Bob Kingsley&#x27;s Country Top 40&quot;==
In 2006, Kingsley signed a new distribution deal with Jones Radio Network (later acquired by Dial Global, which was subsequently acquired by Cumulus Media). The new countdown program was called &quot;Bob Kingsley&#x27;s Country Top 40&quot; and his two-minute program was called &quot;Bob Kingsley with Today&#x27;s Hit Makers&quot;. In 2015, Nash Icon (the media brand and network of country music stations owned by Cumulus Media) announced it would begin distributing classic &quot;ACC&quot; programs for syndication under the name &quot;American Country Countdown Rewind With Bob Kingsley&quot;, starting that May. With BKCT40 signing a distribution deal with Skyview Networks (which also distributes the programming of former &quot;ACC&quot; syndicator ABC) since Bob Kingsley&#x27;s death, Cumulus/WW1 has discontinued &quot;ACC Rewind&quot;. Skyview continues to offer reruns of Kingsley&#x27;s countdowns through its own network. Through an arrangement with Nan Kingsley and the Country Music Hall of Fame, CT40 replays currently air Saturdays on Nashville&#x27;s WSM Radio.

==Personal life==
Kingsley&#x27;s wife, Nan, helped to produce &quot;Bob Kingsley&#x27;s Country Top 40&quot;. The couple moved from California to Weatherford, Texas, west of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, in 1995. There they owned the Bluestem Ranch and Kingsley raised cutting horses.

==Illness and death==
In October 2019, Kingsley was diagnosed with bladder cancer, forcing him to cede &quot;CT40&quot; hosting duties for what was intended to be a temporary leave of absence. Kingsley died at his home in Weatherford on October 17, 2019, at the age of 80.

==Honors ==
Kingsley won Country Music Association National Broadcast Personality of the Year honors in 2001 and 2003. He received the 2012 President&#x27;s Award from Country Radio Broadcasters. In November 2016, Kingsley was elected to the National Radio Hall of Fame. Blair Garner, Ralph Emery and Gene Autry were the only country radio personalities inducted before him. 

The month after he died, a celebration was held in Kingsley&#x27;s honor at the Country Music Hall of Fame; attendees included country music stars Garth Brooks, Dierks Bentley and Trisha Yearwood.

<doc id="1301454" wikidata="Q1699336" url="?curid=1301454" title="John Bingham">
<text>John Armor Bingham (January 21, 1815 – March 19, 1900) was an American politician who served as a Republican representative from Ohio and as the United States ambassador to Japan. In his time as a congressman, Bingham served as both assistant Judge Advocate General in the trial of the Abraham Lincoln assassination and a House manager (prosecutor) in the impeachment trial of U.S. President Andrew Johnson. He was also the principal framer of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==Early life and education==
Born in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, where his carpenter and bricklayer father Hugh had moved after service in the War of 1812, Bingham attended local public schools. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1827, his father remarried. John moved west to Ohio to live with his merchant uncle Thomas after clashing with his new stepmother. He apprenticed as a printer for two years, helping to publish the &quot;Luminary&quot;, an anti-Masonic newspaper. He then returned to Pennsylvania to study at Mercer College and then studied law at Franklin College in New Athens, Harrison County, Ohio. There, Bingham befriended former slave Titus Basfield, who became the first African-American to graduate college in Ohio. They continued to correspond for many years.

Hugh and Thomas Bingham were longtime abolitionists who were both active in local politics. They initially allied with the Anti-Masonic Party, led in Pennsylvania by Governor Joseph Ritner and state representative Thaddeus Stevens. Hugh became clerk of the Mercer County court and later a perennial Whig candidate in the county known for opposing war with Mexico. Matthew Simpson, Bingham&#x27;s longtime friend since childhood, became a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church and urged President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Simpson delivered a prayer at the White House and a funeral oration at the interment ceremony in Springfield, Illinois.

==Early legal career==
After graduation, Bingham returned to Mercer, Pennsylvania, to read law with John James Pearson and William Stewart, and he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar on March 25, 1840, and the Ohio bar by year&#x27;s end. Bingham then returned to Cadiz, Ohio, to begin his legal and political career. An active Whig, Bingham campaigned for President William Henry Harrison. His uncle, Thomas, a prominent Presbyterian in the area, had served as associate judge in the Harrison County Court of Common Pleas from 1825 to 1839. The young lawyer&#x27;s practice extended to Tuscarawas County, Ohio, and its seat, New Philadelphia. In 1846, Bingham won his first election as district attorney for Tuscarawas County, serving from 1846 to 1849.

==Early political career==
Bingham&#x27;s political activity continued despite the Whig Party&#x27;s decline. Campaigning as candidate of the Opposition Party, he was elected to the 34th Congress, representing the 21st congressional district. In Washington, D.C., he roomed at the same boarding house as did fellow Ohio representative Joshua Giddings, a prominent abolitionist whom Bingham admired. Voters reelected Bingham to the 35th, 36th and 37th Congresses as a Republican. However, the district was one of two Ohio districts eliminated in the redistricting following the census of 1860. Bingham thus ran for reelection in what became the 16th district. Known for his abolitionist views, he lost to Democratic peace candidate Joseph W. White, and thus failed to return for the 38th Congress, in part because Union soldiers (mostly Republican-leaning) who were away from home fighting in the war were not allowed to vote by mail in Ohio. Nonetheless, the House of Representatives appointed Bingham as one of the managers of impeachment proceedings against West Hughes Humphreys.

During the Civil War, Bingham strongly supported the Union and became known as a Radical Republican. President Abraham Lincoln appointed him Judge Advocate of the Union Army with the rank of major during his hiatus from Congress, and Bingham briefly became solicitor of the United States Court of Claims in 1865. Bingham&#x27;s judge advocate service was exceptional in the sense that he was a prosecutor or appellate reviewer in three significant military trials. He oversaw critical aspects of the trials of General Fitz John Porter in 1863, Surgeon General William Hammond in 1864 and the military commission trial of the Lincoln assassination conspirators in 1864.

==United States House of Representatives==
Bingham defeated incumbent congressman Joseph Worthington White in the next congressional election. For this election, Ohio had changed its law and now allowed soldiers away from home to vote by mail. Bingham returned to serve in the 39th Congress, which first met on March 4, 1865.

===Lincoln assassination trial===
The following month, the capital fell into chaos as John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, and Booth&#x27;s co-conspirator Lewis Powell severely injured Secretary of State William H. Seward on the night of April 14, 1865. Booth died on April 26, 1865, from a gunshot wound. When the trials for the conspirators were ready to start, Bingham&#x27;s old friend from Cadiz, Edwin Stanton, appointed him to serve as Assistant Judge Advocate General along with General Henry Burnett, another Assistant Judge Advocate General, and Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General.

The accused conspirators were George Atzerodt, David Herold, Lewis Powell (Paine), Samuel Arnold, Michael O&#x27;Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd and Mary Surratt. The trial began on May 10, 1865. On June 29, 1865, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill the president. Spangler was sentenced to six years in prison, Arnold, O&#x27;Laughlen and Mudd were sentenced to life in prison and Atzerodt, Herold, Powell and Surratt were sentenced to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed by the Federal government of the United States. O&#x27;Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler and Mudd were pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in early 1869.

===Fourteenth Amendment ===
In 1866, during the 39th Congress, Bingham was appointed to a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction tasked with considering suffrage proposals. Bingham submitted several versions of an amendment to the Constitution to apply the Bill of Rights to the states. His final submission, which was accepted by the committee on April 28, 1866, read, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot; The committee recommended that the language become Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It was introduced in the spring of 1866, passing both houses by June 1866.

In the closing debate in the House, Bingham stated:

Except for the addition of the first sentence of Section 1, which defined citizenship, the amendment weathered the Senate debate without substantial change. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868.

Despite Bingham&#x27;s likely intention for the Fourteenth Amendment to apply the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights to the states, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to interpret it that way in the Slaughter-House Cases and in &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot;. In the 1947 case of &quot;Adamson v. California&quot;, Supreme Court justice Hugo Black argued in his dissent that the framers&#x27; intent should control the court&#x27;s interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and he attached a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham&#x27;s congressional testimony. Though the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black&#x27;s interpretation, the court over the next 25 years used a doctrine of selective incorporation to extend to application against the states the protections in the Bill of Rights as well as other unenumerated rights.

Ohio ratified the Fourteenth Amendment on January 4, 1867, but Bingham continued to explain its extension of citizenship during the fall election season. The Fourteenth Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and has come to be cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the Constitution. In retrospect The National Constitution Center described John Bingham in tretrospect as &quot;a leading Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives during Reconstruction and the primary author of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment. This key provision wrote the Declaration of Independence’s promise of freedom and equality into the Constitution. Because of Bingham’s crucial role in framing this constitutional text, Justice Hugo Black would later describe him as the 14th Amendment’s James Madison.&quot; It hailed him as &quot;Second Founder who most worked to realize the universal promise of Madison’s Bill and Jefferson’s Declaration.&quot;

===Later congressional career===

Bingham continued his career as a representative and was reelected to the 40th, 41st and 42nd Congresses. He served as chairman of the Committee on Claims from 1867 to 1869 and a member of the Committee on the Judiciary from 1869 to 1873.

====Impeachment of Andrew Johnson====
Bingham played a prominent role in combatting a number of early efforts by Radical Republicans to impeach President Andrew Johnson.

On March 7, 1867, during House debate on a proposed amendment to a resolution renewing the first impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson, Wilson was questioned by Benjamin Butler as to whether or not he supported impeaching President Johnson. Bingham responded by declaring that, unlike some individuals, he was opposed to impeaching before having testimony. After the inquiry recommended that the House impeach Johnson, on December 7, 1867, Bingham was in the sizable majority of House members present that voted against impeaching Johnson.

On February 24, 1868, Bingham voted to impeach Johnson when the House voted to do so after Johnson having moved to oust Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton in apparent disregard for the Tenure of Office Act. Bingham was voted to serve as one of the House managers (prosecutors) in the subsequent impeachment trial of President Johnson.

===Failure to be reelected in 1872===
Bingham was implicated in the Crédit Mobilier scandal and in 1872, he lost the election. Three local Republican political bosses made a deal to cut Bingham out, instead selecting Lorenzo Danford as the party&#x27;s candidate. Thus, Danford came to represent the 16th district in the 43rd Congress and was reelected several times, but with a hiatus.

==Minister to Japan==
President Ulysses Grant then appointed his ally Bingham as United States Minister to Japan, which involved a salary increase but also economic responsibilities with respect to the small legation. (The legation was upgraded to embassy status and the title of minister was upgraded to ambassador in the early 20th century.) Initially, Bingham tried to switch appointments with John Watson Foster of Indiana, whom Grant had appointed minister to Mexico, but Foster declined. Bingham thus sailed with his wife and two of his three daughters to Japan. Bingham served longer than any other minister to Japan, with his appointment spanning the terms of four Republican presidents from May 31, 1873, to July 2, 1885. His successor was appointed in 1885 by newly elected Democratic president Grover Cleveland.

Bingham moved the embassy from an unsuitable location and replaced a problematic interpreter with a Presbyterian missionary from Ohio. He then managed to curtail the imperialistic ambitions of fellow Union veteran Charles Le Gendre. Bingham came to greatly respect Japanese culture, but he also presciently expressed his fear that Japan&#x27;s military culture would hurt the country&#x27;s development.

Bingham most prominently distinguished himself from other Western diplomats by fighting against the unequal treaties imposed upon Japan by Britain, particularly provisions for extraterritoriality and tariff control by Westerners. Initially, Bingham supported Japan&#x27;s right to restrict hunting by foreigners to certain times and places and later its right to regulate incoming ships via quarantines to restrict the spread of cholera. Bingham later negotiated return of the Shimonoseki indemnity in 1877 as well as a revision of Japan&#x27;s treaty with the United States in 1879, which restored some tariff autonomy to Japan, conditioned upon other treaties with Westerners.

==Later life and death==
Bingham was a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention. In his later years, he was frequently interviewed by journalists on topics ranging from current events in Japan to his 1857 appointment of George Armstrong Custer to the United States Military Academy. He died in Cadiz on March 19, 1900, nine years after his wife Amanda had died. He was interred next to her in the Old Cadiz (Union) Cemetery in Cadiz.

==Legacy==
In 1901, Harrison County erected a bronze statue honoring Bingham in Cadiz.

Bingham&#x27;s house now serves as Mercer County&#x27;s Republican headquarters.

<text>Buffalo Grove High School (BGHS) is a public high school located in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, a northwestern suburb of Chicago. It is one of six four-year comprehensive high schools in Township High School District 214, serving portions of the villages of Buffalo Grove, Arlington Heights, and Wheeling. Feeder schools are Cooper Middle School, Thomas Middle School, and London Middle School.

==History==
Buffalo Grove High School opened in 1973, drawing students and staff from Wheeling and John Hersey High Schools. Dr. Clarence M. &quot;Chick&quot; Miller, formerly assistant principal at Wheeling High School, was named the school&#x27;s first principal.

On March 12, 1976, President Gerald Ford, during his campaign against former California Governor Ronald Reagan, made a March primary appearance in the gymnasium of Buffalo Grove High School.

In 2003, new classrooms, a foyer, and offices opened as part of a six-million dollar renovation. The &quot;Circle Drive&quot; on the west side of the school was greatly reduced in size to make room for the new classrooms and foyer. The new classrooms included new science labs and special-ed facilities. Additionally, room was made in old storage space on the second floor of the south side of the building for new foreign-language classrooms.

On August 27, 2004, the Bison hosted their first Friday night game under new lights at Bison Stadium. They were the final team in the Mid-Suburban League to switch from Saturday afternoons to Friday night games.

==Academics==
Buffalo Grove High School won a 1999–2000 Blue Ribbon Award for Excellence, presented by the United States Department of Education.

In 2008, the average ACT score was 23.3, and 95.5% of the class of 2008 graduated on time. BGHS failed to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) according to the federal No Child Left Behind Act because of scores below the minimum target on the Prairie State Achievement Examination and ACT in two student subgroups.

==Athletics==
A renovation of the school in 2014 added a multimillion-dollar pool area. Teams from Buffalo Grove HS compete in the Mid-Suburban League (MSL). Buffalo Grove is also a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), the governing body for most interscholastic sports and competitive activities in Illinois.

The school sponsors interscholastic teams for boys and girls in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, gymnastics, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball, and water polo. Boys may compete in baseball, football, and wrestling. Girls may compete in badminton, bowling, and softball. In 2011 the school inducted a co-ed competitive cheerleading team to perform at athletic games and compete in the winter and spring.

===State championships===

* Basketball (Girls): 1999–00
* Bass fishing: 2016–17
* Football: 1986–87
* Soccer (Boys): 1988–89
* Competitive Co-Ed Cheerleading: 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2022–23

==Activities==
Buffalo Grove supports 47 student clubs and activities, an entire and updated list of which can be found at the school&#x27;s website. These include music, the arts, culture and language, social/political action, and student government. Buffalo Grove also has a nationally recognized Speech and Debate team, boasting the 99th best Lincoln Douglas Debate team in the National Forensics League.

Among the clubs are chapters of these more nationally notable groups: NJROTC, SADD, Scholastic Bowl, Science Olympiad (which won the Illinois State Championship in 1989, 1990 and 2024), and Mathletes.

In March 2012, the Scholastic Bowl Team qualified for the IHSA State Meet in Peoria, Illinois by beating William Fremd High School in the Sectional Final at North Chicago High School. They were also the Regional Champions and MSL Conference Champions, beating Fremd in dramatic fashion 485-480.

Another prominent group at Buffalo Grove was its show choir, The Expressions. This mixed competition show choir was composed of 38 singer-dancers, 12 band members and 4 crew members. Similar to the hit television show &quot;Glee&quot;, the group met as a class and competed throughout the country at various show choir competitions. They attended the Dekalb Indiana Show Choir Invitational Competition, the Chicagoland Showcase Competition, and the Nashville Show Choir Nationals Competition.

<doc id="1301497" wikidata="Q5379464" url="?curid=1301497" title="Enough Rope">
<text>Enough Rope with Andrew Denton (often shortened to Enough Rope) is a television interview show originally broadcast on ABC1 in Australia. The title of the show came from the phrase &quot;give someone enough rope and they&#x27;ll hang themselves&quot;.

The program was the brainchild of Australian comedian, social critic, producer and media personality Andrew Denton, who hosted the show. The hour-long chat show aired from 2003 to 2008.

==Overview==

The show was based around in-depth interviews Denton held with a celebrity or person of note, usually before a studio audience. Many high-profile guests would comment on Denton&#x27;s meticulous research in interview preparation.

In addition to celebrities, Denton&#x27;s interviewees have included people who are perceived to have extraordinary life stories or to hold interesting professions. An occasional feature of the show was &quot;Show &amp; Tell&quot;, in which Denton interviewed members of the studio audience, who revealed unusual stories about themselves.

The show initially competed against the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Micallef Tonight&quot; in the Monday 9:30 pm timeslot, and critics have claimed that &quot;Enough Rope&quot; high ratings forced Nine to axe their program. Throughout 2004 and 2005 &quot;Enough Rope&quot; continued to dominate, averaging well over a million viewers weekly. At the beginning of both 2007 and 2008, the series began with several &quot;More Than Enough Rope&quot; specials, a series that revisited interviews with past guests along with behind the scenes footage. In 2008, the series had a series of interviews with people who are of &#x27;older age&#x27;, and these interviews were re-titled &quot;Elders with Andrew Denton&quot; instead of the usual &#x27;Enough Rope&#x27; banner. Elders also aired in 2009. The show also included three &#x27;On the Road&#x27; specials in which Denton travelled to a small country town and interviewed some of the local residents about their lives and experiences. The towns which the show visited were Rainbow, Victoria (2006), Mount Isa, Queensland (2007) and Kununurra, Western Australia (2008).

In an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in October 2008, Denton announced that the 2008 season would be the last. He claims to have ended the show because he thought &quot;It&#x27;s a good time to finish.&quot; and saw his television future behind the camera.
In a 2018 interview he said it was because he believed more of his guests were putting on an act instead of being themselves.

==Notable guests==
Some of the high-profile international guests that appeared on the show include former U.S. President Bill Clinton, David Attenborough, Al Gore, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Bob Geldof, Antonio Banderas, Helen Mirren, Bono, Dave Grohl, Dr Jane Goodall, Elton John, Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Angelina Jolie, Clint Eastwood, Mel Brooks, and Michael Parkinson. Denton sometimes flew to international destinations to conduct his interviews.

On a local level, comedian Dave Hughes opened up about what led him to give up alcohol, and lifestyle television pioneer Don Burke shed some light on the axing of his show, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Backyard&quot;. A highly publicised interview with disgraced footballer Wayne Carey conducted in the weeks after a series of controversies drew in a television audience of 1.5 million viewers. Other Australian guests of note include Bernie Banton, Russell Crowe and Tim Minchin and Kevin Bloody Wilson.

&quot;Enough Rope&quot; was at the centre of political controversy in 2005 due to a controversial interview with former ALP opposition leader Mark Latham which almost did not make it to air (Latham was also interviewed for &quot;Lateline&quot;). In 2004, Denton interviewed the controversial anti-immigration figure from Australian politics, Pauline Hanson, who argued that she was not a racist.

For the final program, aired on 8 December 2008, the guests were Ben Stiller and Wendy Whiteley.

<text>Sándor Torghelle (; born 5 May 1982) is a Hungarian former professional footballer who played as a forward. During his career, he played for Honvéd, Marcali, Crystal Palace, Panathinaikos, PAOK, Carl Zeiss Jena, FC Augsburg, Fortuna Düsseldorf, Videoton, and Vasas. He played 42 games for the Hungary national team between 2004 and 2010.

==Club career==

===Crystal Palace===
After developing in Hungary and playing for Budapest Honvéd, Marcali VFC and MTK Hungária, Torghelle signed for Crystal Palace, in August 2004 for a fee of roughly £750,000. He caught their eyes after scoring both goals for Hungary national team in their shock international friendly 2–0 victory over Germany in Kaiserslautern before UEFA Euro 2004. He wore the number 10 shirt, that of a first-choice striker, but found it hard to gain a regular place in the Crystal Palace starting eleven with Andy Johnson often playing as a lone striker. He scored only one goal in a League Cup match against Charlton, but the referee sent him off late in the game for diving.

After 12 months at Palace, Torghelle was first stripped of his first-team squad number (given number 30, while 10 went to new signing Jon Macken), and shortly after was loaned out to Panathinaikos in Greece for the 2005–06 season. In the deal, there was no clause for re-calling him, so he spent the whole season in Greece. However, he failed to impress, and Panathinaikos chose not to make the deal permanent.

===PAOK===
Torghelle was transferred to PAOK in Greece and handed a three-year contract, being one of the three players that were traded for the transfer of striker Dimitris Salpingidis.

He was also famous for his failure to score even a single goal since he was transferred from Crystal Palace, yet this &quot;curse&quot; was lifted when he scored in a PAOK-Olympiakos derby in early 2007. He left PAOK at the end of the 2006–07 season for 2. Bundesliga team Carl Zeiss Jena. There, he finally met the expectations, scoring eight goals over the course of the 2007–08 2. Bundesliga season. Carl Zeiss Jena finished in last place and was relegated to the new 3. Liga.

===FC Augsburg===
Torghelle transferred to 2. Bundesliga team FC Augsburg before the start of the 2008–09 season. He played two seasons for the largest team in Swabian Bavaria.

===Fortuna Düsseldorf===
On 17 May 2010, Torghelle left FC Augsburg and signed with another 2. Bundesliga team Fortuna Düsseldorf.

===Budapest Honvéd===
Torghelle signed with former club Honvéd in August 2011. That reunion was short-lived and he signed for fellow Hungarian National Championship team Videoton FC in January 2012.

==International career==
Torghelle made 42 appearances for the Hungary national team. He scored several decisive ones during the 2010 World Cup Qualification campaign, such as against Albania and Malta. He came to prominence after scoring both goals in a 2–0 victory over Germany in a friendly match in 2004.

<doc id="1301510" wikidata="Q4007161" url="?curid=1301510" title="Vacation (The Go-Go's album)">
<text>Vacation is the second studio album by American rock band the Go-Go&#x27;s, released on July 20, 1982, by I.R.S. Records. The album reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The title track reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

Despite the album&#x27;s success, the recording period was hampered by several issues. Most of the band&#x27;s lineup was struggling with drug addiction and were starting to argue more over creative differences. There was also growing discord between songwriter and lead guitarist Charlotte Caffey, lead singer Belinda Carlisle, and guitarist Jane Wiedlin, who had begun to take more of an interest in songwriting. These problems were never resolved and would result in the band&#x27;s dissolution following the disappointing sales of their third album, &quot;Talk Show&quot;. 

The single &quot;Vacation&quot; was also issued in what may possibly have been the first cassette single. In addition to the title track, two more singles were pulled from the album at the time: &quot;Get Up and Go&quot; and &quot;This Old Feeling&quot;, the former of which peaked at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song &quot;Speeding&quot;, which is not included on the album, is a Caffey/Wiedlin composition used as B-side of the single for &quot;Get Up and Go&quot;.

In 2016, Edsel Records reissued remastered deluxe editions, all with bonus tracks, of the Go-Go&#x27;s original three releases.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called &quot;Get Up and Go&quot; a &quot;rousing pop/rocker&quot;, saying that &quot;the rhythm is as peppy as the title would indicate.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;spirited pop/rock anthem&quot; that is &quot;invigorating&quot; despite not being as &quot;seamless&quot; or having as much &quot;mass appeal&quot; as the preceding hit single &quot;Vacation&quot;. &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; critic Gary Graff called it a &quot;beach party pop tune.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Ken Tucker called &quot;This Old Feeling&quot; a &quot;perfect pop song: an ethereal melody is anchored by Kathy Valentine&#x27;s bass as Carlisle&#x27;s voice skims the surface of a pleasant memory just beyond reach&quot; and said that &quot;Rarely has the woozy pleasure of a good daydream been rendered more movingly in rock music.&quot;

<text>The Council of the District of Columbia (or simply D.C. Council) is the legislative branch of the government of the District of Columbia. As permitted in the United States Constitution, the district is not part of any U.S. state and is overseen directly by the federal government.

Since 1975, the United States Congress has devolved to the Council certain powers that are typically exercised by city councils elsewhere in the country, as well as many powers normally held by state legislatures. However, the Constitution vests Congress with ultimate authority over the federal district, and therefore all acts of the council are subject to congressional review. They may be overturned by Congress and the president. Congress also has the power to legislate for the district and even revoke the home rule charter altogether.

The council meets in the John A. Wilson Building in downtown Washington, D.C.

==History==

Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to legislate for the district &quot;in all cases whatsoever,&quot; which has long been interpreted to vest Congress with ultimate authority over the capital. However, the Founding Fathers envisioned that Congress would delegate this authority to local officials. At various times in the district&#x27;s history, Congress has devolved some of its authority to district residents and their elected representatives.
When Congress passed the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, they called for a new permanent capital of the United States to be located on the Potomac River. The federal district originally comprised land in the form of a square measuring on each side donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia. The Residence Act also provided for the selection of a three-member board of commissioners, appointed by the president, charged with overseeing the construction of the new capital. Two other incorporated cities that predated the establishment of the district were also included within the new federal territory: Georgetown, founded in 1751, and the City of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. A new &quot;federal city&quot; called the City of Washington was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of the established settlement at Georgetown.

In 1800, Congress created a joint commission to recommend the governance for what was then called the Territory of Columbia. The joint commission recommended a governorship and a 25-member legislative assembly. This would have been the federal district&#x27;s first legislature. However, the Organic Act of 1801 officially organized the entire federal territory under the control of Congress but did not establish an overarching government for the entire district as recommended. In 1802, the original board of commissioners was disbanded, and the City of Washington was officially incorporated. The city&#x27;s incorporation allowed for a local municipal government consisting of a mayor appointed by the president and an elected six-member council. The local governments of Georgetown and Alexandria were also left intact. In 1820, the Congress granted the City of Washington a new charter, which allowed for an elected mayor.

This piecemeal governmental structure remained essentially intact until the passage of the Organic Act of 1871, which created a new government for the entire District of Columbia. This Act effectively combined the City of Washington, Georgetown, and the unincorporated area then known as Washington County – the portion south of the Potomac River had been returned to Virginia in the late 1840s – into a single municipality as Washington, D.C., exists today. In the same Organic Act, Congress created a territorial government which consisted of a legislative assembly with an upper-house composed of eleven council members appointed by the president and a 22-member house of delegates elected by the people, as well as an appointed Board of Public Works charged with modernizing the city. In 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed the board&#x27;s most influential member, Alexander Robey Shepherd, to the new post of governor. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects to modernize Washington but overspent three times the approved budget, bankrupting the city. In 1874, Congress abolished the district&#x27;s local government in favor of a direct rule.

A three-member Board of Commissioners replaced the territorial government; two members were appointed by the president after approval by the Senate and a third member was selected from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. One of the three members would be selected to act as President of the Board. This form of government continued for nearly a century. Between 1948 and 1966, six bills were introduced in Congress to provide some form of home rule, but none ever passed. The commissioner form of government was replaced in 1967 by a mayor-commissioner and a nine-member city council appointed by the president.

Due to public pressure and the demands of handling the district&#x27;s complex day-to-day affairs, Congress eventually agreed to devolve certain powers over the district to an elected local government. However, lawmakers in Congress during the early 1970s had originally sought to re-institute the post of governor and create a 25-member legislative assembly. Local officials opposed this form of government, insisting that the district&#x27;s status as a municipality be respected. On December 24, 1973, Congress obliged the demands of local residents and enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, providing for an elected mayor and the 13-member Council of the District of Columbia. The council has the ability to pass local laws and ordinances. However, pursuant to the Home Rule Act all legislation passed by the D.C. government, including the district&#x27;s local budget, remains subject to the approval of Congress. After signing the bill, President Richard Nixon said, &quot;I believe the legislation skillfully balances the local interest and the national interest in the way the District of Columbia is governed.&quot;

==Composition==

The council is composed of thirteen members, each elected by district residents to a four-year term. One member is elected from each of the district&#x27;s eight wards. Four at-large members represent the district as a whole. The chairman of the council is likewise elected at an at-large basis. The terms of the at-large members are staggered so that two are elected every two years, and each D.C. resident may vote for two different at-large candidates in each general election.

According to the Home Rule Act, of the chair and the at-large members, a maximum of three may be affiliated with the majority political party. In the council&#x27;s electoral history, of the elected members who were not affiliated with the majority party, most were elected as at-large members. In 2008 and 2012, Democrats such as David Grosso, Elissa Silverman, and Michael A. Brown changed their party affiliation to Independent when running for council.

To become a candidate for council an individual must be resident of the District of Columbia for at least one year prior to the general election, a registered voter, and hold no other public office for which compensation beyond expenses is received. Candidates running for a ward position must be a resident of that ward.

Like other legislatures, the council has several standing committees and a full-time staff, including a council secretary, auditor, and general counsel. Given the limited number of council members, nearly every member of the council has, in effect, the opportunity to chair a committee. Commentators have questioned the legislature&#x27;s structure noting that with 13 members nearly any piece of legislation can pass with just seven votes, leading to accusations that the council can too easily overreach in its powers. However, this unique governing structure has also allowed the council to operate more efficiently in comparison to some state legislatures with regard to consideration and passage of laws.

===Committees===
Committees of the council consider legislation relevant to specific policy matters and are responsible for oversight on relevant local government agencies. Special committees are convened to consider investigations, ethics, and other matters.

The members are nominated by the chairperson of the committee at the start of the council period and are voted on by the existing committee members. If a vacancy of a member occurs, the seat is filled by a vote on a nomination by the chairperson. If a vacancy of a councilperson occurs,

==Salaries==
As of December 2018, the eight ward and four at-large council members receive an annual salary of $140,161, while the council chairman receives an annual salary of $210,000. According to a 2011 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the DC council were the second-highest-paid local representatives of large cities in the United States.

<text>Armand Pien (Gent, 2 January 1920 – Gent, 22 September 2003) was a Belgian weatherman for 37 years. He was popular because his weather predictions were funny and somewhat cryptic. His show, &quot;The Weather&quot;, was broadcast twice a week. It was described in 1985 as mixing &quot;scientific reports with off-beat pranks and displays of bizarre fruits and vegetables grown by viewers&quot;.

After he retired from national television he had a daily (Monday – Friday) weather talk on the East Flanders department of Belgium national radio. He did this until the Friday before his death; he died the following Monday.

In 2005 a small museum was opened in Hoeilaart, Belgium, dedicated to him.

<doc id="1301521" wikidata="Q1277597" url="?curid=1301521" title="Earth 2140">
<text>Earth 2140 is a 2D real-time strategy computer game created in 1997 by Polish-based Reality Pump Studios and published by TopWare Interactive (later acquired by Zuxxez Entertainment). It has two sequels, &quot;Earth 2150&quot; and &quot;Earth 2160&quot;.

==Plot==

&quot;Earth 2140&quot; takes place in the year 2140. In the year 2048, a global nuclear holocaust had engulfed the earth reducing its surface into a nuclear wasteland, forcing most of the world&#x27;s population into underground cities. Tensions rise between the Earth&#x27;s two major factions, the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) and the United Civilized States (UCS), as both sides vie for the world&#x27;s steadily dwindling resources. A UCS raid on an ED base is enough to ignite the rivalry into full-scale war as the ED fails in its bid to control Mexico and the UCS counterattacks Scandinavia, Great Britain, France, and the Iberian Peninsula.

==Factions==

The &quot;United Civilized States&quot; (UCS) controls all of North and South America, Western Europe, North Africa and Australia. This nation is populated mostly by hedonists, due to the near-complete automation of the workforce. Automated butlers are the standard in UCS households; even politics and war are left up to the machines. As such, UCS citizens are often portrayed by their detractors as decadent &quot;pigs&quot;. A glitch in the upgrade of the UCS war processor GOLAN caused the giant robot to miscalculate the military strength of the Eurasian Dynasty, thus compelling it to launch an attack on the ED. After losing several battles in Mexico, GOLAN quickly adapted to the ED threat and began to retake lost ED territory and win battles in Europe. The UCS is generally more technologically advanced than its adversary, employing robot infantry and automated bipedal combat vehicles (more commonly known as mechas).

The &quot;Eurasian Dynasty&quot; (ED) controls Eastern Europe and Asia. The antithesis of the UCS, the ED is run by an autocratic monarchy under the Khan Dynasty that often makes life harsh, short, and without luxury for its citizens. As the less technologically advanced of the two factions, the ED utilizes cyborgs, traditional 20th century standard vehicles such as tanks, and armed helicopters in its arsenal. Because of its technological disadvantage, the ED finds itself more often on the defensive throughout the &quot;Earth 2140&quot; storyline.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Earth 2140&quot; requires the player to complete various objectives, mostly destroying all opposing units and structures (or capturing them). Failure of missions happens when all the player&#x27;s units are wiped out or a vital objective is not met. Structures are built by deploying mobile vehicles on suitable terrain. Mines used to fund the player with money for purchasing can only be built where ore is available. Materials used to gain funds at 1000 credits a piece are carried from a mine (or material on ground) by a BANTHA truck or Heavy Lifter and placed at the Refinery and converted into credits. Mines eventually finish when all ore is extracted.

Each faction has four types of units. The player can create up to 5 queued units and even an infinite queue of the same unit. Unlike most strategy games, credits cannot be refunded when recruitment is cancelled and structures cannot be sold. In some missions, it is possible to call for reinforcements only once. Structures can only be removed with self-destruction. All structures except the Construction Center require power from power plants. Lack of power will cause buildings to operate slowly. Destruction of a power plant leaves a permanent scar on the terrain, which drains vitality of any units nearby. Certain types of buildings must be built to enable the player to build others and to recruit more types of units and vehicles, especially the Research Center. To capture an enemy structure, the player must send in enough units to overwhelm enemy units in garrison. Capturing the opposing faction&#x27;s factories enables the player to make use of otherwise unavailable technology (depending on the research center progress). Guard towers and superweapon launchers cannot be captured. Most of the units and vehicles just move, attack and escort, but certain ones serve with special tasks such as mine laying, cargo carrying and others. Not every vehicle is land-based. A unique feature in the game is that a vehicle once disabled (easily accomplished with ion technology) can be reprogrammed to join the player using a HMCR repair vehicle.

==Expansion packs==

Two expansion packs were released for this game:
* &quot;Earth 2140: Mission Pack 1&quot;
* &quot;Earth 2140: Mission Pack 2 - Final Conflict&quot;

==Reception==

GameSpot gave the game a 6.3 out of ten. Brendan Caldwell from Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the game an imitator of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;.

<text>The District of Columbia Home Rule Act is a United States federal law passed on December 24, 1973, which devolved certain congressional powers of the District of Columbia to local government, furthering District of Columbia home rule. In particular, it includes the District Charter (also called the Home Rule Charter), which provides for an elected mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. The council is composed of a chair elected at large and twelve members, four of whom are elected at large, and one from each of the District&#x27;s eight wards. Council members are elected to four-year terms.

Under the &quot;Home Rule&quot; government, Congress reviews all legislation passed by the council before it can become law and retains authority over the District&#x27;s budget. Also, the President appoints the District&#x27;s judges, and the District still has no voting representation in Congress. Because of these and other limitations on local government, many citizens of the District continue to lobby for greater autonomy, such as complete statehood.

The Home Rule Act specifically prohibits the council from enacting certain laws that, among other restrictions, would:
* lend public credit for private projects;
* impose a tax on individuals who work in the District but live elsewhere;
* make any changes to the Heights of Buildings Act of 1910;
* pass any law changing the composition or jurisdiction of the local courts;
* enact a local budget that is not balanced; and
* gain any additional authority over the National Capital Planning Commission, Washington Aqueduct, or District of Columbia National Guard.

== Laws blocked by Congress ==
The Home Rule Act allows Congress to block any laws passed by the D.C. council. Since its enactment, Congress has exercised this power several times.
* In 1988, Congress voted to block D.C. from expending local funds to cover abortion services through Medicaid. This was repealed in 2009 but then reinstated in 2011.
* Passed by the D.C. Council in 1992, the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act allowed both gay and straight couples to register as domestic partners, allowing familial recognition for such things as hospital visits and allowing the partners of D.C. government employees to purchase private health insurance, was blocked by Congress. The act was finally allowed to go into effect in 2001.
* In 1996, the D.C. Council passed a clean needle exchange program law. However, in 1998, Congress voted to block the law. In 2007, Congress voted to lift the ban, thus allowing the law to go into effect.
* In 1998, Congress voted to block Initiative 59 – &quot;Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998&quot; – via the Barr amendment. This also caused the result of the referendum to be withheld. When this was challenged in court, it was determined that withholding the result of the referendum violated the First Amendment. In response to this, another amendment was passed in 2000 that simply overturned Initiative 59. In 2009, Congress voted to overturn the ban on Initiative 59, allowing D.C.&#x27;s medical marijuana law to go into effect, with the first medical marijuana sale occurring in 2013.
* In 2014, Congress voted to block Initiative 71 – &quot;Legalization of Possession of Minimal Amounts of Marijuana for Personal Use Act of 2014&quot; – by blocking funds from being used to enact laws, rules or regulations for reducing or legalizing any Schedule I drug. However, since this was passed after the results of Initiative 71 had already been announced, it did not prevent the legalization of marijuana, but had the effect of leaving marijuana legal, but without the authority to expend funds on enacting regulations or taxation.
* In 2023, Congress voted in favor of H.J.Res.26 to block the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022. DC&#x27;s Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 would have re-worked criminal justice policies in the District of Columbia. It would have also eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for many crimes. It would have also reduced the maximum penalties for many crimes like burglary, carjacking, and robbery.

<doc id="1301526" wikidata="Q5151595" url="?curid=1301526" title="Comet (train)">
<text>The Comet was a diesel-electric streamliner built in 1935 for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Company. Smaller than the other streamliners, it was a three-car, double-ended train that could operate in both directions and thus did not need to be turned at destinations—ideal for the New Haven&#x27;s cramped terminus at South Station in Boston.

It was initially placed into service between Boston, Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Island on a 44-minute schedule; later, intermediate stops were added at Back Bay in Boston and Pawtucket/Central Falls, Rhode Island, on an advertised &quot;44 miles in 44 minutes&quot; schedule. It ran 5 daily round trips on weekdays, and was often used for weekend excursion trips. This service lasted until the beginning of World War II, when increased traffic volume overwhelmed the capacity of the &quot;Comet&quot;, after which it was placed on local commuter services around the Boston area. The trainset was withdrawn from service in 1951 and scrapped.

The interior was furnished with 48 seat in each power car, and 64 in the center car divided into two sections: a smoking section seating 28 and a non-smoking seating 36. Seating was of the &#x27;walk-over&#x27; type, and all seats were coach-class; there being no provision for first- or parlor-class seating.

The exterior was machined aluminum in a whorled pattern with color bands of bright blue enamel at window height, dark blue enamel at wheel level, and a gray enamel roof. The whole exterior was covered with a coat of clear varnish to prevent tarnishing. The front ends were sharply raked, with a pointed &quot;chin&quot; pilot.

<doc id="1301531" wikidata="Q5384747" url="?curid=1301531" title="Equol">
<text>Equol (4&#x27;,7-isoflavandiol) is an isoflavandiol estrogen metabolized from daidzein, a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and other plant sources, by bacterial flora in the intestines. While endogenous estrogenic hormones such as estradiol are steroids, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen. Only about 30–50% of people have intestinal bacteria that make equol.

== History ==
(&quot;S&quot;)-Equol was first isolated from horse urine in 1932, and the name was suggested by this equine connection. Since then, equol has been found in the urine or plasma of many other animal species, although these animals have significant differences in their ability to metabolize daidzein into equol. In 1980, scientists reported the discovery of equol in humans. The ability of (&quot;S&quot;)-equol to play a role in the treatment of estrogen- or androgen-mediated diseases or disorders was first proposed in 1984.

==Chemical structure==
Equol is a compound that can exist in two mirror-image forms known as enantiomers: (&quot;S&quot;)-equol and (&quot;R&quot;)-equol. (&quot;S&quot;)-equol is produced in humans and animals with the ability to metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein, while (&quot;R)&quot;-equol can be chemically synthesized. The molecular and physical structure of (&quot;S&quot;)-equol is similar to that of the hormone estradiol. (&quot;S&quot;)-Equol preferentially binds estrogen receptor beta.

==Pharmacology==

===Estrogen receptor binding===
(&quot;S&quot;)-equol is a nonsteroidal, selective agonist of ERβ (Ki = 16 nM) with 13-fold selectivity for ERβ over ERα. Relative to (&quot;S&quot;)-equol, (&quot;R&quot;)-equol is less potent and binds to ERα (Ki = 50 nM) with 3.5-fold selectivity over ERβ. (&quot;S&quot;)-Equol has about 2% of estradiol&#x27;s binding affinity for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and 20% of estradiol&#x27;s binding affinity for human estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). The preferential binding of (&quot;S&quot;)-equol to ERβ vs. ERα and in comparison to that of estradiol suggests the molecule may share some of the characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Equol has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).

===Pharmacokinetics===
(&quot;S&quot;)-Equol is a very stable molecule that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability.
When (&quot;S&quot;)-equol is consumed, it is rapidly absorbed and achieves a Tmax (rate of peak plasma concentration) in two to three hours. In comparison, the Tmax of daidzein is 4 to 10 hours because daidzein exists in glycoside (with a glucose side chain) form. The body must convert daidzein to its aglycone form (without the glucose side chain) via removal of the sugar side chain during digestion before it can use daidzein. If consumed directly in aglycone form, daidzein has a Tmax of one to three hours.
The percent fractional elimination of (&quot;S&quot;)-equol in urine after oral administration is high and in some adults can reach close to 100 percent. The percent fractional elimination of daidzein is much lower at 30 to 40 percent.

==Production in humans==
To produce (&quot;S&quot;)-equol after soy consumption, humans must have certain strains of bacteria living within their intestines. Twenty-one different strains of intestinal bacteria cultured from humans have been shown to have the ability to transform daidzein into (&quot;S&quot;)-equol or a related intermediate compound. Several studies indicate that only 25 to 30 percent of the adult populations of Western countries produce (&quot;S&quot;)-equol after eating soy foods containing isoflavones, while 50 to 60 percent of adults from Japan, Korea, and China are equol-producers. Vegetarians have also been reported to be more capable of transforming daidzein into (S)-equol. Seaweed and dairy consumption can enhance the production of equol. The ability of a person to produce (&quot;S&quot;)-equol is determined by testing people who have not taken any antibiotics for at least a month. For this standardized test, the individual drinks two 240 milliliter glasses of soy milk or eats a soy food equivalent for three days. The (&quot;S&quot;)-equol concentration in each test subject&#x27;s urine is determined on day four.

===Equol producing bacteria===
While many more bacteria are involved in the related intermediate process of equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to daidzein, or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that achieve the &quot;complete conversion&quot; of daidzein to (S)-equol, include:
* Adlercreutzia equolifaciens
* Asaccharobacter celatus AHU1763
* Bacteroides ovatus
* Bifidobacterium
* Bifidobacterium animalis
* Coriobacteriaceae sp MT1B9
* Eggerthella sp YY7918
* Enterococcus faecium
* Eubacterium sp D1 and D2
* Finegoldia magna
* Lactobacillus mucosae
* Lactobacillus sp Niu-O16
* Lactococcus garvieae (Lc 20-92)
* Ruminococcus productus
* Slackia sp HE8
* Slackia equolifaciens (Strain DZE)
* Streptococcus intermedius
* Veillonella sp

Conversion by Bifidobacterium has only been reported once by Tsangalis et al. in 2002 and not reproduced since.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Mixed cultures such as Lactobacillus sp. Niu-O16 and Eggerthella sp. Julong 732 can also produce (&quot;S&quot;)-equol.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Some equol producing bacteria, as implied by their nomenclature, are Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Slackia equolifaciens and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens.

== Health effects ==
=== Skin health ===

The topical effects of equol as an anti-aging substance have been shown in different studies. The effects result from both molecular and structural changes to the skin. Equol can, for instance, lead to an increase in telomere length. As an antioxidant, equol can decrease the aging process by reducing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It may also act as a protective anti-photoaging substance by inhibiting acute UVA- induced lipid peroxidation. In addition, equol may have a positive impact on epigenetic regulation. Equol&#x27;s phytoestrogenic properties may also affect skin health. Reduction of dark circles and eye wrinkles after treatment with equol has been reported. Equol may also protect skin from damage by pollution due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.

Each of the enantiomers and the racemic mixture of both enantiomers have different characteristics, bioavailabilities and molecular effects. According to one study, (RS)-equol provided the greatest overall improvement in skin health, especially when applied topically.

=== Hormone-related health effects ===

Beyond topical effects, medicinal equol has been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and muscle and joint pain. (RS)-equol was also reported to reduce symptoms associated with menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal itching, vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse and cause positive shifts in the vaginal bacterial population, cell composition, and pH.

According to animal studies, it has anti-androgenic effects and may lead to inhibited 5-alpha reductase as well as lowered dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels.

<text>The Natural History Museum () is a natural history museum located in Berlin, Germany. It exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history and in such domain it is one of three major museums in Germany alongside Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Frankfurt and Museum Koenig in Bonn.

The museum houses more than 30 million zoological, paleontological, and mineralogical specimens, including more than ten thousand type specimens. It is famous for two exhibits: the largest mounted dinosaur in the world (a &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; skeleton), and a well-preserved specimen of the earliest known bird, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. The museum&#x27;s mineral collections date back to the Prussian Academy of Sciences of 1700. Important historic zoological specimens include those recovered by the German deep-sea Valdiva expedition (1898–99), the German Southpolar Expedition (1901–03), and the German Sunda Expedition (1929–31). Expeditions to fossil beds in Tendaguru in former Deutsch Ostafrika (today Tanzania) unearthed rich paleontological treasures. The collections are so extensive that less than 1 in 5000 specimens is exhibited, and they attract researchers from around the world. Additional exhibits include a mineral collection representing 75% of the minerals in the world, a large meteor collection, the largest piece of amber in the world; exhibits of the now-extinct quagga, huia, and tasmanian tiger, and &quot;Bobby&quot; the gorilla, a Berlin Zoo celebrity from the 1920s and 1930s.

In November 2018 the German government and the city of Berlin decided to expand and improve the building for more than €600 million.

== Name ==
The museum&#x27;s name has changed several times. German speakers mainly call this museum &quot;Museum für Naturkunde&quot; since this is the term on the façade. It is also called &quot;Naturkundemuseum&quot; or even &quot;Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin&quot; so that it can be distinguished from other museums in Germany also named as &quot;Museum für Naturkunde&quot;. The museum was founded in 1810 as a part of the Berlin University, which changed its name to &quot;Humboldt University of Berlin&quot; in 1949. For much of its history, the museum was known as the &quot;Humboldt Museum&quot;, but in 2009 it left the university to join the Leibniz Association. The current official name is &quot;Museum für Naturkunde – Leibniz-Institut für Evolutions- und Biodiversitätsforschung&quot; and the &quot;Humboldt&quot; name is no longer related to this museum. Furthermore: there is another Humboldt-Museum in Berlin in Tegel Palace dealing with brothers Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt.

The Berlin U-Bahn station &quot;Naturkundemuseum&quot; is named after the museum.

== Exhibitions ==
Since the museum renovation in 2007, a large hall explains biodiversity and the processes of evolution, while several rooms feature regularly changing special exhibitions.

=== Dinosaur Hall ===
The specimen of &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; &quot;brancai&quot; in the central exhibit hall is the largest mounted dinosaur skeleton in the world.

It is composed of fossilized bones recovered by the German paleontologist Werner Janensch from the fossil-rich Tendaguru beds of Tanzania between 1909 and 1913. The remains are primarily from one gigantic animal, except for a few tail bones (caudal vertebrae), which belong to another animal of the same size and species.

The historical mount (until about 2005) was 12.72 m (41 ft 5 in) tall, and 22.25 m (73 ft) long. In 2007 it was remounted according to new scientific evidence, reaching a height of 13.27 m. When living, the long-tailed, long-necked herbivore probably weighed 50 t (55 tons). While the &quot;Diplodocus carnegiei&quot; mounted next to it (a copy of an original from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, United States) actually exceeds it in length (27 m, or 90 ft), the Berlin specimen is taller, and far more massive.
==== &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; ====
The &quot;Berlin Specimen&quot; of &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot; (HMN 1880), is displayed in the central exhibit hall. The dinosaur-like body with an attached tooth-filled head, wings, claws, long lizard-like tail, and the clear impression of feathers in the surrounding stone is strong evidence of the link between reptiles and birds. The &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; is a transitional fossil; and the time of its discovery was apt: coming on the heels of Darwin&#x27;s 1859 magnum opus, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, made it quite possibly the most famous fossil in the world.

Recovered from the German Solnhofen limestone beds in 1871, it is one of 12 &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; to be discovered and the most complete. The first specimen, a single 150-million-year-old feather found in 1860, is also in the possession of the museum.

=== Minerals Halls ===
The MFN&#x27;s collection comprises roughly 250,000 specimens of minerals, of which roughly 4,500 are on exhibit in the Hall of Minerals.

=== Evolution in action ===
A large hall explains the principles of evolution. It was opened in 2007 after a major renovation of parts of the building.

=== Tristan – Berlin bares teeth ===

The Museum für Naturkunde normally exhibits one of the best-preserved &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; skeletons (&quot;Tristan&quot;) worldwide. Of approximately 300 bones, 170 have been preserved, which puts it in the third position among others.

=== Wet Collection ===
The glass-walled Wet Collection Wing with 12.6 km of shelf space displays one million specimens preserved in an ethanol solution and held in 276,000 jars.

== History ==

=== The collection history ===
19th century to 1945

When the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, now the Humboldt University of Berlin, opened in 1810, the existing scientific and medical collections were combined and made accessible to the public for the first time. Therefore the Geological-Paleontological Museum, the Mineralogical-Petrographic Museum and the Zoological Museum were founded and were open to anyone interested to visit. Around 1880, the constantly growing collections based on donations, purchases and expedition finds took up around two thirds of the space in the main building, Unter den Linden, and “formed an oppressive burden”. The royal state government therefore decided in 1874 to build new buildings for the agricultural college and the collection of the Museum of Natural History on the site of the already closed Royal Iron Foundry on Invalidenstrasse. The architectural competition that was announced contained the requirements to enable all collection elements to be arranged as uniformly as possible. The winner of the competition was the architect August Tiede, who initially suggested storing the exhibits separately, but then had to give up.

As a result, a multi-wing building was built at Invalidenstrasse 43 between 1875 and 1880 under the senior construction management of Friedrich Kleinwächter and the construction management of the government architect Hein. The opening was celebrated on December 2, 1889.

Contrary to initial plans, the Natural History Museum only made part of its holdings accessible to the public as a display collection, while the main collection was reserved for interdisciplinary research work. This practice, which is common today, was considered revolutionary at the time. The first building extension was built between 1914 and 1917.

In the 1910s and 1920s, the facility on Invalidenstrasse was called the Museum of Natural History and Zoological Institute. It was divided into the Geological-Paleontological Institute and Museum, the Mineralogical-Petrographic Institute and Museum, the Zoological Institute and Museum and had several employees such as university lecturers, taxidermists, castellans, stokers, machine masters, servants, caretakers, library servants.

During World War II, the east wing of the museum building was heavily damaged in a daytime raid by the United States Army Air Forces on February 3, 1945. While large parts of the building collapsed, several people died in the air raid shelter. Large whale skeletons from the collection were buried and the exhibition rooms for insects and mammals were destroyed. About 75 percent of the collection was brought to safety.

After the war until 2015

On September 16, 1945, the Natural History Museum, which was now located in the Soviet sector of Berlin, was the first Berlin museum to reopen after the end of the war. The years after the war were characterized by repairing the war damage to the building and securing the collections. From the 1950s onwards, the museum showed new permanent exhibitions. During the GDR era, the collections were expanded with finds from research trips to Cuba, Mongolia and the Soviet Union, for example fossilized plants from the Mongolian steppe or a coral reef from Cuba. Visits by representatives of Western countries, however, remained the exception.

In reunified Germany, the museum was initially reorganized into three institutes: mineralogy, paleontology and systematic zoology. The building was renovated and subjected to extensive modernization. In 2006, a further reorganization followed into three departments for research, collections, exhibitions and public education.

In 2005, the dinosaur skeletons on display were temporarily dismantled to make room for the upcoming renovation of the roof and the entire large exhibition hall, which was financed with funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the State of Berlin and the German Class Lotterie Berlin Foundation. In total, four halls and a staircase were renovated and completely redesigned with multimedia components at a cost of around 16 million euros. The reopening took place on July 13, 2007 with new exhibitions on the evolution of life and the earth. Within a year of this reopening, over 731,000 visitors visited the museum.

Due to its supra-regional importance, the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin was granted the status of a foundation under public law on January 1, 2009 and was accepted as a member of the Leibniz Association.

Since the 2020s

An international architectural competition started on December 23, 2022 to fundamentally repair the historic building stock and to supplement and expand the available space with new buildings. The mission is Museum of Natural History – Future Plan for the Science Campus, i.e. h. A new science campus is to be built. The basis for this competition is the agenda “Future plan – conceptual and structural development perspectives for the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin” developed by the museum management in 2018. The museum should live up to its responsibility as a “place of information, reflection and discussion with society”. The three main functional areas – collections and collection infrastructure, research infrastructure and science communication/visitor infrastructure – are to be strengthened.

=== The building history ===
Overview

As a result of the continuously growing natural science collections, a complex new exhibition building was planned on the site of the former Royal Iron Foundry on Invalidenstrasse, in which the three museums mentioned above would be combined. The new building ensemble was given the name Museum für Naturkunde during the planning phase, consisting of the corresponding central collection and the parts of the Prussian Geological State Institute with the Mining Academy (Geological State Institute and Mining Academy) and the Berlin Agricultural University.

The university management, together with the Berlin magistrate, announced an architectural competition, which August Tiede won with his multi-wing project proposal.

All construction costs including the interior furnishings amounted to around 3.2 million marks.

Building descriptions with additions and conversions

August Tiede planned the buildings uniformly in historicizing classical forms (“in the Hellenistic sense”), based on the Louvre in Paris. The three parts of the building along Invalidenstrasse as the front side are generously grouped around a courtyard-like forecourt. The connecting elements were front gardens, which were laid out between 1883 and 1889 according to plans by the garden architect Richard Köhler, and a fountain in front of the central building. In addition, an area of around 500 m² was left free from the former foundry site, which was intended to widen Invalidenstrasse. And according to the construction plans, once the complex was completed, all three parts were to be connected to each other by side halls.

All elements of the building ensemble were heated by a central boiler house, which stood in the third northern courtyard of the natural history building. Individual solutions had to be created for the furnishings (cupboards, drawers, consoles, cross beams, glass panels) and equipment as well as the entire color scheme.

Museum of Natural History

The building area with a size of 20,071 m² is located on the ploten Invalidstrasse 43. As early as 1915/1916, the three northern wings of the main building received an extension to accommodate the zoological collection.

It is an almost square main building with a front length of 85 m, to which an approximately 140 m long four-wing cross wing was added at the back, designed as a simple brick building. The wing buildings facing north are around 37 m long and there are three 23 m wide courtyards in between. The facades of the main building are clad with tuff stone and Rackwitz sandstone. Other wall materials used were bricks, Old Warthauer sandstone, Main sandstone, polished Swedish granite, Belgian limestone and artificial marble.

A three-axis, slightly sculpturally structured raised central projection characterizes the street facade of the building. The top floor is decorated with Corinthian double columns, two statues and three relief portraits of famous scientists: Johannes Müller and Leopold von Buch, as well as Chr. G. Ehrenberg, Alexander von Humboldt and Chr. Sam. White above the second floor windows in laurel-crowned medallions created by sculptor August Ohrmann. A wide staircase leads into the interior with a foyer, followed by an atrium reserved for the large exhibits of the animal collection.

The collection and work rooms inside are wide-span halls on iron supports; the vaults between the iron girders are made of porous stones. On the two gable ends of the main building there are large staircases in iron constructions and work rooms for supervisory officers of the individual departments of the museum. The rear wing structures are finished with cast plaster caps between the iron beams and a supporting corrugated iron covering.

For the floors, Tiede used terrazzo and oak rods in asphalt. Within the museum building there were two lecture halls and apartments for the curator. The ground floor and first floor of the western wing formed a complete service building for the museum director and his family.

In the basement of the eastern wing, a drying chamber and degreasing and maceration systems were installed, which were supplied by the Berlin company E. A. Lentz. Even safety measures against water/moisture and fire have been taken into account.

State Geological Institute and Mining Academy

The construction area at Invalidenstrasse 44 covered 12,028 m². These additional buildings were also opened in 1889. The state geological institute needed additional space after just under 15 years. A north wing was built between 1890 and 1892 based on plans by Fritz Laske and a further extension was built in 1913.

The mining academy used the ground floor rooms around a large atrium, the state geological institute was located on the floors above. Circumferential column arcades structured the atrium. Worth mentioning here were a bench with the motif of the Prussian eagle, two lying stone lions on the stair stringers, a cast-iron group of lions at the courtyard entrance, and a sitting dog cast from bronze on the outside of the side portal. This is a replica of the Molossian dogs from the second half of the 3rd century BC. BC, who were posted as a couple in front of the former veterinary college; however, the second figure was lost. Except for the dogs, these were historical pieces of equipment from the former iron foundry at this location, manufactured in 1867.

Agricultural college

The construction area for the Agricultural University with 11,204 m² is located on the Invalidenstrasse 42 plot. This building was also completed in 1889, and expansion work had to be carried out after a very short time (1876–1880). This also resulted in a multi-wing facility that was planned and realized by Kern &amp; Krencker and E. Gerhardt.

A glass-covered atrium forms the center, in which there is a statue of Albrecht Daniel Thaer, a German researcher, designed by Christian Daniel Rauch. Attached to the atrium is a staircase with a spacious vestibule. The floors on the upper ground floor are decorated with ornamental mosaics. In the northwest part of the university building, a cast iron staircase leads to the upper floors. In four wall niches around the atrium, famous agricultural researchers are honored with marble busts.

Post-war work and modernizations

At the end of the Second World War, the museum ensemble was severely damaged by a bombing raid (as shown under History) and in later street fighting.

The ruins of the Natural History Museum were then briefly rebuilt and could continue to be used, but the east wing remained empty for the time being.

The western part of the building ensemble was repaired in a simplified form after the war in 1946/1947 under the direction of Walter Krüger. Although procurement was not easy, color-coordinated natural stones were used.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the administrative reform, Max Dudler was able to restore the wing of the Geological State Institute from 1996 to 2000 with financial support from the Berlin Senate. Since the German government moved to Berlin, it has housed the Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transport.

From mid-November 2006, after ten years of planning, the reconstruction of the east wing of the Natural History Museum, estimated at 29.6 million euros, began as a modern concrete building with historical facade reliefs. After four years of construction, the part of the building was opened to the public in September 2010 in time for the Natural History Museum&#x27;s 200th birthday. In January 2012, the reconstruction carried out by the architectural firm Diener &amp; Diener received the DAM Prize for Architecture in Germany.

Just twelve years later, in November 2018, the state of Berlin and the federal government decided to expand and renovate the house for over 600 million euros. Among other things, the exhibition area was increased from 5,000 to 25,000 square meters and the digital development of the collection was promoted. The latter can be observed live in one of the exhibition halls (due to the corona pandemic, the exhibitions were closed from March 2020 to the end of 2022).
