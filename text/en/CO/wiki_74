8 September 1977: Sir Alf Ramsey makes a shock return to management, taking over at the First Division&#x27;s basement side Birmingham City following the resignation of Willie Bell.

13–14 September 1977: In the Anglo-Scottish Cup quarter-final first legs, Fulham versus St Mirren and finishes 1–1, as does Notts County&#x27;s visit to Motherwell. Bristol City and Blackburn Rovers are beaten, by Partick Thistle and Hibernian respectively.

19 September 1977: Tommy Docherty makes a swift return to management at Derby County, who demote Colin Murphy back to his previous role as reserve team manager.

27–29 September 1977: English clubs make up two of the four Anglo-Scottish Cup semi-final contingent, as Notts County and Bristol City progress. Blackburn and Fulham are eliminated, the latter after two late goals saw St Mirren win the match 5–3 on the night and 6–4 on aggregate.

30 September 1977: Manchester City, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool are level on points at the top of the League at the end of September. Newcastle United and winless Derby County fill the bottom two places.

15 October 1977: Bottom-of-the-table Newcastle United lose their tenth consecutive League match, a club record.

22 October 1977: Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s challenge for an immediate return to the First Division is boosted by a 9–0 home win over Bristol Rovers, in which debutant striker Colin Lee scores four goals and his partner Ian Moores scores a hat-trick.

31 October 1977: Nottingham Forest continue to set the pace at the end of October. They are now four points ahead of Liverpool. Newcastle United remain bottom, and are joined by Leicester City and Bristol City in the relegation zone.

9 November 1977: Newcastle United sack manager Richard Dinnis, as a result of the club&#x27;s appalling form combined with Dinnis publicly criticising chairman Lord Westwood&#x27;s running of the club.

18 November 1977: Bill McGarry is appointed as Newcastle United&#x27;s new manager, and shakes the club up by immediately announcing that several of the players who threatened strike action to secure the appointment of previous manager Richard Dinnis earlier in the year, in particular Alan Gowling, Tommy Craig and team captain Geoff Nulty, are transfer-listed with immediate effect and will not play for the club again.

19 November 1977: Leeds United beat Nottingham Forest 1–0.

30 November 1977: After picking up just four points from four matches this month, Nottingham Forest have had their lead at the top of the table cut to just one point by Everton, with West Bromwich Albion and Coventry City a further two points behind. At the bottom, Newcastle United are already seven points from safety; Leicester City and West Ham United complete the bottom three.

17 December 1977: Nottingham Forest shock everyone by beating Manchester United 4–0 at Old Trafford, shaking off the &#x27;caretaker leaders&#x27; tag applied to them by members of the media, who firmly believed Liverpool would lead the way at this stage.

Arsenal go level on point with the Toffeemen by registering their fifth consecutive away win, with victory at West Bromwich Albion.

31 December 1977: Nottingham Forest end a remarkable year with a clear five-point lead over Everton at the top of the First Division. Newcastle United have overtaken Leicester City at the bottom, and Queens Park Rangers have slipped into the relegation zone just two seasons after finishing second in the League.

7 January 1978: FA Cup third round day sees Leeds United fans invade the Elland Road pitch, reportedly to get their match with Manchester City called off after the Yorkshire club go 2–0 down; City&#x27;s goalkeeper Joe Corrigan is hauled to the ground.

10 January 1978: Liverpool pay a British record £352,000 for Middlesbrough midfielder Graeme Souness.

28 January 1978: First Division strugglers Leicester City are knocked out of the FA Cup by Third Division Walsall in one of the shocks of this season&#x27;s competition. Holders Manchester United are held to a 1–1 draw at home by West Bromwich Albion.

31 January 1978: Nottingham Forest&#x27;s title bid shows no signs of faltering, and they are six points ahead of Manchester City, Everton and Liverpool at the end of January.

1 February 1978: West Bromwich Albion beat Manchester United 3–2 in an FA Cup fourth round replay. John Toshack, 29 next month, becomes the youngest manager in the Football League when he ends eight years on Liverpool&#x27;s playing staff to become player-manager of Swansea City.

31 March 1978: Nottingham Forest remain in a commanding position at the top of the First Division, four points ahead of Everton with two games in hand. At the bottom, Leicester City and Newcastle United have been cut adrift, and Queens Park Rangers are one point behind West Ham United in the battle to avoid the remaining relegation spot.

5 April 1978: Leicester City sack manager Frank McLintock, following a defeat to Liverpool which has all but confirmed their relegation barring a highly improbable set of results.

15 April 1978: Leicester City&#x27;s relegation is confirmed with a 4–1 defeat at home to Birmingham City. The Foxes go down with just four wins and 22 goals from their 39 matches so far this season.

17 April 1978: Newcastle United lose at Aston Villa and are relegated to the Second Division.

22 April 1978: Nottingham Forest seal the Football League First Division title, and become only the third club in history to do so a year after winning promotion. They get the point they need to guarantee the championship with four matches left from a goalless draw with Coventry City.

25 April 1978: Harry Griffiths, who recently stepped down as manager of Swansea City but was retained as assistant manager by his successor John Toshack, dies of heart attack aged 47 just before Swansea&#x27;s 3-1 win over Scunthorpe United which moves them closer to promotion to the Third Division.

29 April 1978: West Ham United lose 2–0 at home to Liverpool, and can now only stay up on goal difference if Wolverhampton Wanderers lose their remaining two matches. Alex Stepney, the 35-year-old Manchester United goalkeeper, retires from playing. He spent the final 12 years of his playing career at Old Trafford, and at the time of his retirement he was the club&#x27;s longest serving player and the last player remaining from their European Cup triumph of 1968.

2 May 1978: Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Aston Villa 3–1 to stay in the First Division at West Ham United&#x27;s expense.

4 May 1978: Champions Nottingham Forest draw 0–0 with second-place Liverpool at Anfield to finish seven points clear at the top of the table. They are unbeaten in their last 26 League matches, a run stretching back to November, and have lost just three League games all season.

2 June 1978: Wigan Athletic, runners-up of the Northern Premier League, are elected to the Football League Fourth Division at the expense of Southport. Boston United, champions of the Northern Premier League, had been unable to apply for election to the Football League.

15 June 1978: Blackpool midfielder Alan Groves died of a heart attack aged 29.

==National teams==

Ron Greenwood, general manager of West Ham United and team manager until 1974, accepted an offer to become temporary manager of the England national team in August 1977, initially for three matches only. In November, England beat Italy 2–0 at Wembley Stadium in their final World Cup qualifying game, but failed to qualify for next summer&#x27;s final tournament after Italy won against Luxembourg in December. 

Despite their failure to qualify for the World Cup, Ron Greenwood was appointed England manager on a four-and-a-half-year contract. His first match as permanent England manager ended in a 2–1 defeat to West Germany in Munich in February 1978. In April, a goal from Kevin Keegan gave England a 1–1 draw against Brazil at Wembley. Steve Coppell scored the only goal in England&#x27;s 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park in May. England won the Home Championship with a 100% record.

==UEFA Competitions==

Liverpool won the 1977 European Super Cup by completing a 7–1 aggregate win over Hamburg; they won the second leg 6–0 after drawing 1–1 in the first leg. Former Liverpool striker Kevin Keegan was in the Hamburg side. They went on to beat Club Brugge 1–0 in the 1978 European Cup Final at Wembley Stadium thanks to a Kenny Dalglish goal, thus retaining the European Cup.

Manchester United were thrown out of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup on owing to the behaviour of their fans in the away leg of their tie against St. Étienne. They were reinstated a week later, but had to play the second leg at least 300 km from Manchester, at Plymouth Argyle&#x27;s Home Park ground.

==FA Cup==

Bobby Robson led Ipswich Town to victory in the FA Cup, winning the final 1–0 against Arsenal at Wembley Stadium. Roger Osborne scored the only goal of the game as Ipswich won the FA Cup for the first time. Arsenal and Ipswich reached the final after semi-final victories over Orient and West Bromwich Albion respectively. Second Division Orient reached the semi-final with a 2–1 replay victory over Middlesbrough.

Northern Premier League side Blyth Spartans beat Second Division Stoke City 3–2 away to become the first non-league club to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup in 29 years. They were seconds away from reaching the quarter-finals, but Wrexham equalised from a retaken corner kick before winning 2–1 in the replay. Wrexham had beaten Newcastle United 4–1 in a replay earlier in the competition.

==League Cup==

Nottingham Forest won the League Cup after victory over Liverpool in the replay.

==Football League==
===First Division===
Nottingham Forest won the First Division title with just three league defeats all season, one season after promotion. In doing so, their manager Brian Clough became only the second manager in English football to win the First Division title with different clubs. Clough&#x27;s men also won the Football League Cup. It was the first time that Forest had won either trophy.

Liverpool finished runners-up in the league and retained the European Cup. Everton, Manchester City and Arsenal completed the top five. West Bromwich Albion finished sixth and sealed a UEFA Cup place, having continued to impress in the First Division following the mid-season resignation of Ronnie Allen as manager and the appointment of Ron Atkinson as his successor.

Manchester United broke the British transfer fee record on 9 February by paying Leeds United £495,000 for Scottish defender Gordon McQueen but finished a disappointing 10th, having sacked Tommy Docherty in the close season following the revelation of his affair with the wife of the club&#x27;s physiotherapist. His replacement was former QPR boss Dave Sexton.

Leicester City and Newcastle United were bracketed together on 22 points after a terrible First Division campaign, Newcastle&#x27;s relegation coming just one season after they had finished fifth in the league and qualified for the UEFA Cup. They were joined in the drop zone by West Ham United, the 1975 FA Cup winners, who kept faith in manager John Lyall and managed to hold on to key players Billy Bonds and Trevor Brooking.

===Second Division===
After narrowly missing out on promotion for the last two seasons, Bolton Wanderers finally ended their lengthy absence from the First Division by clinching the Second Division title. Southampton finished a point behind them in second place, ending their four-year absence from the First Division, during which they had won the FA Cup in 1976. Tottenham Hotspur clinched the final promotion place on goal difference, their advantage over fourth-placed Brighton being assisted by a 9-0 scoreline over Bristol Rovers in October, during which striker Colin Lee had scored four goals on his club debut.

For much of the season it had been a four-horse race at the top of the Second Division, with fifth placed Blackburn Rovers finishing eleven points behind the leading pack.

Hull City were relegated to the third tier for the first time since 1966, after a campaign in which four different managers took charge of the team. Mansfield Town were relegated straight back to the Third Division after a year, never looking like they would survive in their first-ever season at this level, though a late fightback after the appointment of veteran manager Billy Bingham at least saw them avoid last place. Blackpool were the final relegated side; they had been safely in mid-table for much of the campaign, but a disastrous end to the season combined with a host of other results going against them sent them down to the third tier for the first time ever. They would not return to this level until 2007.

===Third Division===
Wrexham won the Third Division title to clinch a place in the Second Division. They were joined by Cambridge United and Preston North End. Peterborough United, who had yet to progress beyond this level of the league, missed out on promotion on goal difference. Chester, another club with a similar track record in the league, finished two points short of the promotion places.

Portsmouth, the 1939 FA Cup winners and with two league titles to their name from the early postwar years, finished bottom of the Third Division to fall into the Fourth Division for the first time, and their very existence was also threatened by large debts. Hereford United, Bradford City and Port Vale also went down.

===Fourth Division===
Graham Taylor guided Watford to the Fourth Division title by an 11-point margin to repeat the promotion success he had achieved at Lincoln City two seasons earlier. Southend United finished second, while John Toshack kicked off his managerial career by taking Swansea City to promotion just weeks after being appointed. Brentford clinched the final promotion place, with Aldershot missing out on promotion by two points.

Wimbledon played their first season in the Football League, replacing Workington.

Southport, having finished second-from-bottom for the third season in succession, were voted out of the Football League and replaced by Wigan Athletic. This would ultimately prove the final occasion where a club failed to earn re-election to the League, and the same 92 clubs would continue to make up its membership until 1987, by which point automatic promotion and relegation between the League and the Football Conference had been introduced.

<doc id="1298785" wikidata="Q4819493" url="?curid=1298785" title="Auckland Castle">
<text>Auckland Castle, also known as Auckland Palace, is a former bishop&#x27;s palace located in the town of Bishop Auckland in County Durham, England. The castle was a residence of the bishops of Durham from approximately 1183 and was their primary residence between 1832 and 2012, when the castle and its contents were sold to the Auckland Castle Trust (now the Auckland Project). It is now a tourist attraction, but still houses the bishop&#x27;s offices.

The castle is notable for its chapel, described as &quot;one of the finest rooms in North East England&quot; in the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series, which was the medieval great hall until it was remodelled by Bishop John Cosin in 1661–65. The woodwork, which includes the pulpit, stalls, and screen, was commissioned by Cosin and combines Gothic and Baroque forms. The castle also contains twelve paintings depicting &quot;Jacob and His Twelve Sons&quot; by the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbarán; the thirteenth portrait, &quot;Benjamin&quot;, is a copy, as the original hangs in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. Auckland Castle is a grade I listed building.

==History==
Auckland Castle occupies an area of flat ground between the River Gaunless and River Wear, south of their confluence. The town of Bishop Auckland abuts the castle to the west, and on the other three sides the land falls away steeply to the rivers. The castle was probably begun by Hugh de Puiset, who was bishop from 1153 to 1195, and completed in the first half of the thirteenth century. The present chapel survives from his building, where it served as the great hall.

A college for a dean and nine canons was established immediately west of the castle&#x27;s enclosing wall by Bishop Booth in the fifteenth century.

In 1603 after the Union of the Crowns, Tobias Matthew invited Anne of Denmark, Prince Henry, and Princess Elizabeth to stay at Auckland on their journey from Scotland to London. After the disestablishment of the Church of England at the end of the First English Civil War in 1646, Auckland Castle was sold to Sir Arthur Haselrig, who demolished much of the medieval building, including the original two-storey chapel, and built a mansion. After the Restoration of the Monarchy, Bishop John Cosin in turn demolished Hazelrigg&#x27;s mansion and rebuilt the castle, converting the banqueting hall into the chapel that stands today.

In 1756, Bishop Richard Trevor bought the notable set of paintings, Jacob and his twelve sons, by Francisco de Zurbarán which still hang in the Long Dining Room. It is possible that the seventeenth century paintings were intended for South America. However they never reached their supposed destination, eventually coming into the possession of James Mendez who sold twelve of the thirteen to Bishop Trevor in 1757.

Bishop Trevor was unable to secure the 13th portrait, Benjamin, which was sold separately to the Duke of Ancaster and hangs in Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire. Bishop Trevor commissioned Arthur Pond to produce a copy painting of &quot;Benjamin&quot;. The copy, together with the 12 originals, hang in the castle&#x27;s Long Dining Room, which Bishop Trevor had redesigned especially to take the pictures.
Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham from 1791 to 1826, employed the eminent architect James Wyatt to match the disparate architecture of the palace in the late 18th century, including its Throne Room and Garden Screen. In 1832, when William van Mildert, the last bishop to rule the county palatine of Durham, gave over Durham Castle to found Durham University, Auckland Castle became the sole episcopal seat of the See of Durham.

In 2001 the Church Commissioners voted to sell the paintings, a decision that was revoked in 2011 following a donation of £15 million by investment manager and philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer; new arrangements placed the paintings, along with the castle, under the Auckland Castle Trust, making them available to the public after centuries during which they hung in a private home where they could be seen only by invited guests or by special arrangement with the Bishop&#x27;s staff.

===2019 re-opening===

News reports in 2019 clarified the situation, stating that in 2012, Ruffer had purchased the castle and all of the contents, including the artwork, which included the works by Francisco de Zurbarán. The paintings, which had been on tour, were returned to the site in time for the re-opening of the castle to visitors on 2 November 2019 as the Auckland Project, after a multi-million pound restoration project, funded partly by the National Lottery.

By the time of the opening day, a new high tower had been erected as a visitor centre; the structure has a lift and a staircase as well as balconies for views of the castle from above. The interior had been fully restored, including the bishops&#x27; &quot;palatial&quot; quarters. According to one news item, &quot;each of the 14 restored rooms, recreated from contemporary accounts and personal recollections&quot; features the career of one former bishop. The Faith Museum of world religion and a huge glass greenhouse were under construction on Castle property.

Other attractions already operating at or near the Castle include the Mining Art Gallery (in a nearby former bank building) showing work mainly by self-taught or night school-educated miners; this attraction opened in 2017 (thanks to support provided to the Castle Trust by Bishop Auckland and Shildon AAP and Durham County Council); an open-air theatre, Kynren, depicting &quot;An Epic Tale of England&quot; with a cast of 1,000; and the Bishop Trevor Gallery at the Castle; the latter started displaying the National Gallery&#x27;s Masterpiece touring exhibit in October 2019.

In October 2023, the Faith Museum opened to the public. Designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, it covers 6000 years of British religious history, from the Neolithic period to 2000AD. It is housed in the Scotland Wing of the castle, as well as a new stone-built extension.

In May 2024, the 17th century walled gardens reopened, with a new glasshouse and faith garden. The Great Garden is set to open in 2025.

=== Bek&#x27;s chapel ===
In February 2020, it was announced that the foundations of Bek&#x27;s chapel had been found at the castle by archeologists. It had long been known that the chapel, which would have been one of the largest in Europe, was located on the castle grounds, but its location was unknown. The chapel was built by the warrior-bishop Antony Bek in roughly 1300 at a cost of £148. There was a special exhibition at Auckland Castle from 4 March 2020 to 6 September 2020 to display items found in the excavations.

== Archaeology ==
In June 2024, archaeologists working on the Auckland Project announced the discovery of a Golden Primrose flower decoration along with at least seven large wall remains and cellars filled with rubble. The wall remains are believed to be part of a rectangular building that belonged to Arthur Haselrig.

==Description==

The castle grounds are entered from Bishop Auckland marketplace through the clock tower, which was built in 1760 by Bishop Trevor in the Gothick style. The range which flanks it to the right incorporates the remains of the south range of the fifteenth century college mentioned above; the north and east ranges behind also survive in part. Within the gates, the Faith Museum is to the north, within a gabled stone building intended to reflect the form of medieval tithe barns. To the south are the walled gardens and glasshouse, below a terrace. A castellated screen wall built for Bishop Shute Barrington in 1795 separates the terrace from the castle proper. 

The main buildings form two sides of a courtyard. To the north is the large four-bay aisled chapel, originally the hall of Bishop Pudsey&#x27;s palace. This was built in &quot;c.&quot;1190 with unusually ornate arcades and capitals, and remodelled in &quot;c.&quot;1300 for Bishop Bek. In 1661-65 it was converted for use as a chapel by Bishop Cosin, the original chapel having been destroyed in the Interregnum. At this time the exterior was heavily remodelled in the mixture of Gothic and Baroque characteristic of Cosin, and the clerestory was replaced. The western range housed the bishop&#x27;s state rooms above the offices and service functions (now the café). At its heart this structure is that of Bek&#x27;s extensive reconstruction, but this is now concealed by work of the 16th and 18th centuries. The state rooms as they now appear are largely the work of Wyatt in &quot;c.&quot;1795 for Bishop Barrington. They are in the Gothick style and include along with the normal suite of rooms an ante-room and throne room, as the Prince-Bishop of Durham had until the 19th century quasi-regal powers. The Long Dining Room houses the Zurbarán paintings, while the other rooms contain exhibits on the history of the castle, and the Bishop Trevor art gallery. Behind this range is the Scotland Wing, originally Bishop Tunstall&#x27;s long gallery, but now part of the Faith Museum.

The Castle is surrounded by a deer park of of parkland. It retains many of the medieval elements, including the fish ponds and woodland paths, providing an important record of how the medieval bishops lived, entertained and hunted there.

== Culture ==
The castle was used as the backdrop for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s story &quot;A Legend of Scotland&quot; in the 19th century. In 2006, Auckland Castle was the setting for two episodes of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. In 2013, a 15th-century bed once owned by Henry VII was put on display at the castle.

== Notable structures and historic listing designations==

The castle and its grounds contain seven structures listed by Historic England at Grade I, the highest grade. It also contains a number of buildings listed at Grade II* and Grade II.

<doc id="1298789" wikidata="Q4540386" url="?curid=1298789" title="'64–'95">
<text>″64–&#x27;95 is the third studio album by English electronic music duo Lemon Jelly. The concept album contains tracks that take samples from songs recorded between the years 1964 and 1995. The number that precedes the song title denotes from which year the sample is taken.

The album is rather different from their previous two releases in that it has a darker sound and is influenced by more modern sounding music. To avoid confusion over the matter, the band included a sticker on the sleeve stating, &quot;This is our new album, it&#x27;s not like our old album.&quot;

A hidden track, &quot;Yes!&quot;, appears before track 1 on the special edition CD version of the album. This is a short additional spoken word sample featuring the same voice which appears on the first track, &quot;It Was...&quot;. A DVD version of the album was also released, with animated videos for each track.

==Track listing==
Information is based on the album&#x27;s liner notes
#&quot;Yes! / It Was...&quot; – 1:47 (This name does not appear on CD cover / insert)
#&quot;Come Down on Me&quot; – 5:50
#&quot;Only Time&quot; – 6:36
#&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Now&quot; – 6:56

<text>Jeffrey Renwick Weeks (born December 10, 1956) is an American mathematician, a geometric topologist and cosmologist. Weeks is a 1999 MacArthur Fellow.

==Biography==
Weeks received his BA from Dartmouth College in 1978, and his PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1985, under the supervision of William Thurston. Since then he has taught at Stockton State College, Ithaca College, and Middlebury College, but has spent much of his time as a free-lance mathematician.

==Research==
Weeks&#x27; research contributions have mainly been in the field of 3-manifolds and physical cosmology.

The Weeks manifold, discovered in 1985 by Weeks, is the hyperbolic 3-manifold with the minimum possible volume. Weeks has written various computer programs to assist in mathematical research and mathematical visualization. His SnapPea program is used to study hyperbolic 3-manifolds, while he has also developed interactive software to introduce these ideas to middle-school, high-school, and college students.

Weeks is particularly interested in using topology to understand the spatial universe. His book &quot;The Shape of Space: How to Visualize Surfaces and Three-dimensional Manifolds&quot; (Marcel Dekker, 1985, ) explores the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. The second edition (2002, ) explains some of his work in applying the material to cosmology.

==Awards and honors==
Weeks became a MacArthur Fellow in 1999. In 2007, he won the Levi L. Conant Prize for his expository paper, &quot;The Poincaré Dodecahedral Space and the Mystery of the Missing Fluctuations&quot; (&quot;Notices of the AMS&quot; 2004), and in 2008 he gave the first Levi Conant Lecture at Conant&#x27;s former employer, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

<text>Shane Sutcliffe (born June 17, 1975) is a Canadian former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2004. He is referred to as &quot;Kid Thunder&quot; by his fans.

==Career==
Sutcliffe was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and raised in Regina, Saskatchewan, before moving to Nanaimo, British Columbia at age 12. He had no formal amateur boxing career; after winning 22 &quot;Toughman Contests&quot; in Canada, he made his professional boxing debut in 1992 at the age of 17. His first fight resulted in a sixth-round decision victory over Joe Wade. Shortly afterward he moved to Los Angeles, California and eventually Las Vegas, Nevada, to train with the legendary Eddie Futch. He won other fights by unexpected margins, including a 3-round defeat of Ray Phillips 

In 1997, Sutcliffe moved to and fought out of Montreal, Quebec, after signing a contract with International Boxing Management Interbox. On April 3, 1998, he defeated Ben Perlini via sixth round knockout to win the Canadian Heavyweight championship. In his third defense of the title on February 5, 1999, Sutcliffe lost via 12th-round TKO to former World titleholder Trevor Berbick in Montreal. His contract was then dropped by Interbox as a result. He challenged Berbick again for the title on May 26, 2000, in Vancouver. However, he dropped a close 12 round unanimous decision in that contest.

Sutcliffe took over 2 years off from boxing to start a family after losing to fellow Canadian Patrice L&#x27;Heureux on November 30, 2001. After the birth of his son, Sutcliffe worked construction to provide a steadier source of income for his new family. However, he returned to the sport in 2004, dropping decisions to Wesley Martin and Louis Monaco. 

Sutcliffe is what is termed a &quot;journeyman&quot; fighter, one who &quot;journeys&quot; to a variety of places (often on short notice) to provide relatively easy competition for up-and-coming prospects or fading former champions. He counted Tyrell Biggs, Leon Spinks, Trevor Berbick, Oleg Maskaev, Brian Nielsen, and David Tua among the opponents he faced. As of the beginning of 2006, his ring record stands at 25 wins (15 knockouts), 14 losses, and one draw in 40 professional contests.

<text>SNCASE (abbreviated from Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Sud-Est) or Sud-Est was a French aircraft manufacturer. The company was formed on February 1, 1937, by the nationalization and merger of Lioré et Olivier, Potez, CAMS, Romano and SPCA.

==History==

Following the resolution of the 1936 general strike of French heavy industry, the government of Léon Blum introduced an act to nationalize the French war industry. The act provided for the creation of seven nationalized aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft (SNCASE, SNCASO, SNCAN, SNCAO, SNCAM, SNCAC), and one for aircraft engines (SNCM - Lorraine-Dietrich).

SNCASE incorporated the facilities of Potez in Berre-l&#x27;Étang, CAMS in Vitrolles, Romano in Cannes, SPCA in Marseille and Lioré et Olivier at Argenteuil and Marignane. SNCASE became the largest of the aeronautical &quot;&quot;, with of space in six factories and employees. ( of the workforce came from Lioré et Olivier, along with 90% of then-current manufacturing contracts.)

In 1941, during the Second World War, the Paris design bureaus of both the nationalized and the private aircraft firms were relocated to avoid capture. SNCASE acquired the failing SNCAM and moved its engineering operations to SNCAM&#x27;s headquarters at the former Dewoitine factory in Toulouse.

During the rationalisation of the nationalised Aircraft Industry during the 1950s, SNCASE merged with SNCASO to form Sud Aviation on March 1, 1957, which in turn was later amalgamated into Aérospatiale and eventually the Airbus group.

==Products==
Most early Sud-Est aircraft retained their earlier designations, such as the Lioré et Olivier LeO 451 bomber. The first aircraft produced under the Sud-Est marque was the Sud-Est SE 100 (formerly Leo 50) fighter.

As well as fixed winged aircraft work, SNCASE carried out research into rotary-winged aircraft capitalising on the experience gained from absorbing the Liore et Olivier team which had license-built the Cierva C.30 design (as the LeO C.30 and C.301 to C.305 variants), and designing and building the LeO C.34 (derived from Kellett designs). After World War II further work on autogyro&#x27;s produced the SE.700 and SE.700A multi-seat Liaison autogyros, which were quickly over-shadowed by the rapid development of helicopters.

SNCASE continued experimenting with helicopters with the help from a team from Focke Achgelis building the SE.3000, which was a French version of the twin-rotor Focke Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, and the smaller, more conventional, SE.3101. With this experience SNCASE went on to design the SE.3110 and eventually the SE.3120 Alouette which first flew on 21 July 1951 and broke the helicopter distance and speed records in July 1953. Production versions of the Alouette emerged as the commercially successful Alouette II and Alouette III, resulting in production runs of several hundreds, with many exported.

Fixed wing aircraft were also developed post World War II, with several jet research aircraft and two significant airliners: The SE-2010 Armagnac and the SE-210 Caravelle airliners. Production licences were also obtained from de Havilland for the de Havilland Sea Venom to provide all-weather and day fighters for the Aéronautique Navale., with 121 two-seat and single-seat Aquilon 20 / 201 / 202 / 203 / 204 built from 1952.

<doc id="1298806" wikidata="Q7375286" url="?curid=1298806" title="Roz Doyle">
<text>Rosalinda &quot;Roz&quot; Doyle (born May 5, 1963 or 1964) is a fictional character on the American television sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. Roz is the producer of Frasier Crane&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Frasier Crane Show&quot; on KACL 780 AM.

The role initially went to Lisa Kudrow, but Kudrow was replaced by Peri Gilpin before filming began. The character is named as a tribute to a producer of the television series &quot;Wings&quot; (having the same creators as &quot;Frasier&quot;), who died from breast cancer in 1991. Gilpin reprised her role as Roz in the 2023 revival of &quot;Frasier&quot;. In May 2024 it was announced that Gilpin would be returning in a recurring role.

==Background==
Roz is originally from Bloomer, Wisconsin. Her mother Joanna (Eva Marie Saint) was a longtime politician there and serves as Attorney General. She has a sister, Denise, whom she resents for her supposedly perfect life. Roz&#x27;s parents are divorced. Her relationship with her father was good until he started dating a woman younger than she. She and Roz didn&#x27;t get along and he cut contact with Roz. Her maternal grandmother was an immigrant from Ireland. Frustrated with small-town Wisconsin, Roz moved to Seattle as an adult to pursue a career in radio and worked in the industry for about 10 years before joining Frasier.

==Relationships with other characters==
Early in the series, Roz and Frasier have a strained relationship. As the show goes on, they become very close, often consoling each other through hard times, although the teasing, sardonic element continues.

Roz becomes fast friends with Frasier&#x27;s father Martin. While Frasier and Niles are interested in high culture, Roz and Martin share a more down-to-earth view of life. In Season 1, Episode 18 (&quot;And the Whimper Is...&quot;) Martin greets her by asking, &quot;Hey, Roz, how&#x27;s my girlfriend?&quot; when she drops by his apartment, She is also seen at Martin&#x27;s poker nights in Season 5. The two of them often watch the antics of Frasier and Niles with at least some degree of glee when it inevitably backfires

Roz is also close to Martin&#x27;s physical therapist Daphne Moon, as they are the only two women who are constant in the Crane men&#x27;s lives. Daphne invites Roz to be a bridesmaid at her wedding to attorney Donny Douglas and later to be the maid of honor at her wedding to Niles; however, Daphne elopes with Niles in Reno, Nevada, and Roz is not present for their real wedding.

Roz has an antagonistic relationship with Frasier&#x27;s brother Niles early in the series, but they become quite friendly as the series progresses. In Season 11, Episode 8 (&quot;Murder Most Maris&quot;), Roz defends Niles when he has a nervous breakdown.

==Character arc==
Roz is portrayed as a professional woman with an active sex life, which is the subject of male jokes and snide remarks, especially from Frasier&#x27;s brother Niles. Roz worries about her appearance as she ages, and is concerned that she will never fall in love and get married. She has a brief fling with a co-worker, Bob &quot;Bulldog&quot; Briscoe (much to her later chagrin).

Early in the fifth season, Roz discovers that she is pregnant with the child of a 20-year-old college student with whom she had a brief fling. By the end of the season, Roz gives birth to a girl, whom she names Alice.

Late in the ninth season, Roz finally manages to maintain a seemingly stable relationship with Roger, a city trash collector, but they break up when they see that their relationship chemistry is not right. Frasier consoles her, and this eventually leads them to sleep together. Roz subsequently flees home to Wisconsin, while Frasier chases after her in an attempt to remedy the situation. Frasier ends up posing as Roger, whom the Doyle family had been very excited to meet, although previously being a bit skeptical that Roger was not merely a falsehood constructed by Roz (due to Roz&#x27;s romantic history). It is here that Roz and Frasier reconcile, and agree to remain friends.

In the show&#x27;s final episode, Roz becomes station manager of KACL after the previous manager, Kenny Daly, decides to become a DJ again.

Gilpin reprised her role in the 2023 revival of &quot;Frasier&quot;. It is implied that she still lives in Seattle, but remained close to the Cranes, including Frasier in Chicago. She visits him in Boston to support him through his first Christmas after Martin&#x27;s death.

Roz continues to appear in Season 2 of the revival series, still working as the station manager, which is now struggling. Frasier briefly returns to Seattle when she&#x27;s doing an anniversary piece for KACL, but with the overall decline in radio, she has considered quitting her job at KACL. As she also wants to spend more time with her daughter (who&#x27;s now attending graduate school in Rhode Island), Frasier suggests that she leave Seattle and move to the East Coast.

Alan Tam Wing-lun (; born 23 August 1950) is a Hong Kong singer and actor. He played a major role in developing the Cantopop scene in the 1980s as he was known for singing romantic ballads with modern arrangements. From 1983 to 1987, Alan Tam received numerous music awards and won Most Popular Male Artist and IFPI Award for successive four years, which made him the most famous superstar singer of Hong Kong in 1980s. In early 1988, he publicly quit all pop music award ceremonies and put most efforts in searching new direction for Cantopop music.

Today, he is still active in the music and film industry, releasing new albums on a regular basis. Since the late 1980s, he has served as a mentor for the cantopop music industry, earning the nickname the &quot;Principal&quot; or &quot;Principal Tam&quot;. Today he is regularly seen across the media in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and various parts of East Asia participating in all types of entertainment-related events and charity activities. As of 2013, Alan Tam has launched a total of 115 solo albums and has sold over 35 million records worldwide; he also holds the record for having held the most concerts in Hong Kong as a solo artist. 20 of his albums have been certified platinum by the IFPI Hong Kong.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Tam was born on 23 August 1950 at Healthy Village in North Point. He is son of football player Tam Kong-pak (譚江柏), who represented the Republic of China national team during the 1936 Summer Olympics. He attended Shau Kei Wan Government Secondary School and Chi Lin Buddhist Secondary School. Then, he majored in Economics while attending Ngee Ann Technical College in Singapore.

===Personal life===
Tam married Sally Yeung Kit-mei in 1981. They have no children. Tam met his partner Wendy Chu in 1991; a son was born to them in 1995.

==Career==

===Early years===
Tam developed a passion for music in his secondary school years in Hong Kong. He formed a band called &quot;The Wynners&quot; (溫拿樂隊) with his friends. They subsequently entered an amateur singing contest and took the first prize to begin a career in the entertainment industry, appearing in a number of TVB variety shows. The group disbanded, and he later reformed into the band The Wynners with Kenny Bee in 1973. The Wynners performed mostly in English. Tam was one of the two lead singers in the band until it split in 1978.

His first album as a solo artist was &#x27;Naughty Boy&#x27; (反斗星) in 1979. An early success was the song &#x27;Love in Autumn&#x27; (愛在深秋), first performed in 1984.

===As a solo singer===
Tam&#x27;s first album as a solo artist was &quot;Naughty Boy&quot; (反斗星) in 1979. He later releases such as &quot;Love in Autumn&quot; (愛在深秋) in 1984 or &quot;Embrace&quot; (擁抱), &quot;Flower in Water&quot; (水中花) or &quot;Half Dazed, Half Awoken&quot; (半夢半醒) achieved commercial success. In the 1981 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, he also won his first major individual song award. His 1984 albums of (愛的根源), (霧之戀) and 1985 (愛情陷阱) formed a successful trilogy of albums. In 1988, he made an announcement that he would not accept any more awards with competition involved. He continued to release albums for the next 30+ years. From 1981 to 1988, he won a top 10 song award every year. This was in addition to his winning a top 10 song award every year from 1983 to 1987 for the Jade solid gold awards. In 1993, he released the English album &quot;My Love&quot;, in collaboration with Korean singer Kim Wan-Sun.

The Hong Kong press frequently reported a fierce rivalry between Tam and fellow singer Leslie Cheung. Although both artists were at peace with each other, it was the fans who created the spectacle of a musical feud. In the late 90s, the singers brushed aside any doubts about their friendship, and even appeared together in galas and other special programmes. In 1999, Leslie Cheung, together with other 17 singers, participated in the Album &quot;Paying Tribute to Alan Tam&quot; (誰可改變15週年紀念集) and collaborated to produce the single remix of Tam&#x27;s popular songs &quot;Illusion&quot; (幻影) and &quot;Foggy Love&quot; (霧之戀).

In 2003, he teamed up with fellow artist Hacken Lee for a major world tour entitled Alan &amp; Hacken (, also translated as &quot;Left Alan Right Hacken&quot;). The name is a play on a Chinese idiom which means &quot;neighbours&quot; (左鄰右里). Up to 2013, they have performed around the world in countries like China, United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Singapore, Taiwan, Macau, Malaysia, and Japan with over 100 concerts. Since 2006, he has been helping his godson Kelvin Kwan establish a career in the Hong Kong pop industry.

One of his signature fast songs &quot;Love Trap&quot; (愛情陷阱) earned him the 25th Anniversary Jade Solid Gold song honour award in 2006. By 1995, he had already sold more than 20 million albums. By 2005, he had launched more than 104 albums, and 800 songs. He has taken part in 264 concerts, of which 189 were individual concerts.

In 2007, he was the recipient of the 30th Hall of Fame Award from the Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong (CASH) for his 30+ years of contributions to the Hong Kong and Chinese music industry (以表揚他三十多年來對香港音樂創作及華人樂壇的貢獻).

===Actor===

In the 1970s, Tam hosted the variety show &quot;The Wynners Show&quot; and took part in the television drama &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. He decided to pursue opportunities in Taiwan in 1980, and starred in renowned director Pai Ching-jui&#x27;s &quot;A Girl Without Sorrow&quot;. He subsequently starred in more than ten films in Taiwan including &quot;The Funny Couple&quot; and &quot;Part Time Job&quot;. He later starred in a number of films like &quot;Armour of God&quot; with Jackie Chan and &quot;Master Wong v. Master Wong&quot; which is a parody of legendary Canton kung fu fighter Wong Fei Hung. In 1981, Tam won the Best Actor award at the Golden Horse Awards for his role in &quot;If I Were for Real&quot;. He has virtually retired from acting since &quot;Age of Miracles&quot; (1996) and &quot;Aces Going Places&quot; (1997). However, he makes a comeback for &quot;Here Comes Fortune&quot; in 2010.

===President of Artistes Guild===
On 11 January 2008, Tam was elected as president of the Hong Kong Performing Artistes Guild. Just a month after he was elected, the Edison Chen photo scandal caused a media storm. The Guild condemned the increasing circulation and uploading of obscene photos on the Internet. Tam was interviewed daily by different media on the handling of the case. He stated, &quot;The circulation of such obscene photos has created a bad atmosphere in society.&quot;

After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Tam helped set up a relief committee to look after the livelihood and schooling of orphaned children. He was on a HK committee along with Eric Tsang, Jackie Chan, and Eason Chan.

===Entrepreneur===
In 1997, an announcement was made in Admiralty, Hong Kong to launch a Star East Entertainment restaurant concept boasting 40 celebrity investors. It was one of the most publicised investments made by Tam in collaboration with his best friends Natalis Chan and Eric Tsang. In 2000, a merger was made between Star East and Planet Hollywood.

===Politics===

During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, and after &quot;worldwide coverage for Hong Kong’s police force utilizing heavy-handed tactics against student demonstrators&quot;, Tam sided with the police and attended a pro-police rally, saying &quot;No one in the world has ever seen law enforcement officers attacked like that&quot;. A backlash from fans followed quickly, with some fans smashing his records in public.

=== YouTuber ===
On 11 April 2024, Tam put a verification video on his official YouTube account after posting old video of his live performances in the past 13 years.

<text>The Aerial Demonstration Squadron (, EDA), popularly known as Smoke Squadron (Portuguese: &quot;Esquadrilha da Fumaça&quot;) is the Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s air demonstration squadron. It is headquartered at the Brazilian Air Force Academy in Pirassununga, São Paulo.

== History ==
Its first display was on 14 May 1952 over Copacabana beach, using the North American T-6 Texan. The team used the T-6 from its formation until 1968, when it switched to the French Aérospatiale (Fouga) CM.170-2 Super Magister jet, called T-24 in FAB service. However, this model proved unsuitable to Brazilian conditions and, in 1972, the squadron reverted to the T-6, which was used until 1977.

The EDA was disbanded in 1977, but reformed on 8 December 1983 using Neiva T-25 Universal piston-powered aircraft, soon to be replaced by the then-new Embraer EMB-312 Tucano turboprop trainer. At the time the EDA&#x27;s aircraft were painted a bright red scheme, which has since been superseded by the current gloss blue.

==Objectives==
The stated objective of the Smoke Squadron are:
* To bring together civilian and military aeronautical communities
* To contribute towards a better integration between the Air Force and the other Armed Forces
* To represent the Brazilian Air Force in Brazil and abroad
* To encourage youngsters to take up civilian and military aeronautical careers
* To show the quality of the Brazilian aerospace industry
* To show the capabilities of the Brazilian Air Force crews.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft used by the EDA have been, in chronological order:
* North American T-6 Texan for 1225 displays;
* Aérospatiale (Fouga) CM.170-2 Super Magister for 46 displays;
* Neiva T-25 Universal for 55 displays;
* Embraer EMB-312 Tucano with more than 2000 displays as of 2010;
* Embraer EMB-314 Super Tucano, being the two first ones delivered on September 30, 2012. In the subsequent two years, Super Tucanos have replaced the Tucano in the Smoke Squadron

<text>Laura Innes (born August 16, 1957) is an American actress and television director. She played Kerry Weaver in the medical drama &quot;ER&quot; (1995–2009), which earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 2001, she received her third Primetime Emmy Award nomination for directing the episode &quot;Shibboleth&quot; of the political drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. She also appeared in the thriller drama &quot;The Event&quot; (2010–2011) and &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; (2018–2020).

==Career==
Innes was introduced to professional theater by her father, who frequently took the family to the Stratford Festival of Canada in Stratford, Ontario. Following his advice to &quot;do what you love,&quot; she attended Northwestern University graduating in 1980, where she was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and earned a degree in theater. 

Her first stage credits were in Chicago at the Goodman Theatre and Wisdom Bridge Theatre, where she played Stella in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. John Malkovich played Mitch in this production. Other major stage credits include &quot;Two Shakespearean Actors&quot; with Eric Stoltz at Lincoln Center, &quot;Our Town&quot; at the Seattle Repertory Theatre, and &quot;Three Sisters&quot; at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.

In 1986, Innes co-starred as Krissy Bender Marino, the daughter of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara in the short-lived sitcom &quot;The Stiller and Meara Show&quot;. In 1989, Innes played Miss Andrews in the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Hey Dude&quot; in the second season episode &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pest&quot;. She also played Mrs. Fleeman in the episode &quot;Baby&quot;. In the 1990s, Innes guest-starred in television series including &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; and appeared in the Emmy-winning TV movie &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; before being cast in her first major television role in the NBC sitcom &quot;Wings&quot; from 1991 to 1993. She played Bunny, the promiscuous ex-wife of Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church).

In the fall of 1995, Innes began a recurring role in the second season of the hit NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, where she was cast as Dr. Kerry Weaver, the skilled chief of the ER with an abrasive exterior and a physical disability. She was added to the main cast in the third season. In 2001, her character came out as gay during the seventh season. She received two Emmy Award nominations for her role, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards with the &quot;ER&quot; ensemble cast, and has received five nominations for Best Supporting Actress from Viewers For Quality Television. Innes also directed a number of episodes of the series, and episodes of &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;House&quot; and &quot;The West Wing&quot;, one of which earned her an Emmy nomination for directing.

In January 2007, Innes left &quot;ER&quot; in the middle of the thirteenth season, becoming the longest-serving cast member in the show&#x27;s history, but Noah Wyle appeared in four more episodes than her. From 2008 to 2009, Innes returned to &quot;ER&quot; during its 15th and final season for two episodes including the series finale &quot;And in the End...&quot;. Innes&#x27; films include the blockbuster science fiction disaster film &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998) and the comedy &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; (1999) with her former &quot;ER&quot; co-star Noah Wyle.

On May 7, 2010, NBC announced that Innes would be co-starring in the short-lived science fiction/mystery/action/thriller drama &quot;The Event&quot; as Sophia, &quot;the leader of a mysterious group of detainees&quot; with Lisa Vidal, who played Kerry Weaver&#x27;s wife, Sandy Lopez, in the eighth, ninth and tenth seasons of &quot;ER&quot;. In 2012, she co-starred as Police Captain Tricia Harper in the short-lived NBC fantasy police procedural drama &quot;Awake&quot;.

==Personal life==
Innes was born and raised in Pontiac, Michigan, the youngest daughter of six children to Laurette and Robert Innes, a tool and die company executive. Her first fiancé, actor David Bell, was murdered in December 1980. A few years after the murder, she married actor David Brisbin and, in 1990, gave birth to their son, Cal. They later adopted a daughter, Mia, from China. 

In 2006, Innes told the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that ten years of portraying Dr. Weaver&#x27;s limp had caused her to experience the early stages of actual spinal damage (&quot;the bottom of my spine is starting to curve on one side from 10 years of raising my hip&quot;), and as a consequence, &quot;ER&quot;″s producers introduced a plot arc in which Weaver&#x27;s disorder was surgically corrected.

==Charity work==
Innes is an advocate for the disabled community, utilizing her role as a director to help employ disabled people. She is a supporter of the Performers with Disabilities Committee, which is associated with the Screen Actors Guild.

<text>Frieda Inescort (born Frieda Wrightman, 29 June 1901 – 26 February 1976) was a Scottish actress best known for creating the role of Sorel Bliss in Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Hay Fever&quot; on Broadway. She also played the shingled lady in John Galsworthy&#x27;s 1927 Broadway production &quot;Escape&quot; and Caroline Bingley in the 1940 film of Jane Austen&#x27;s Pride and Prejudice.

==Early years==
Born in Edinburgh, Inescort was the daughter of Scots-born journalist John &quot;Jock&quot; Wrightman and actress Elaine Inescourt ( Charlotte Elizabeth Ihle), who was of German and Polish descent. They married in 1896 but parted ways when their daughter was still a young child.

While she lived in Britain, Inescort wrote for a newspaper in London and worked as secretary to Lord Astor. (Another source says that she was secretary to Lady Astor.)

After going to the United States, she not only acted but also worked as associate editor of &quot;The Exporter&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;.

==Stage==
Inescort&#x27;s acting debut came in &quot;The Truth About Blayds&quot; (1922), which was presented at the Booth Theatre on Broadway. Her other Broadway credits include &quot;You and I&quot; (1923), &quot;The Woman on the Jury&quot; (1923), &quot;Windows&quot; (1923), &quot;The Fake&quot; (1924), &quot;Ariadne&quot; (1925), &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (1925), &quot;Love in a Mist&quot; (1926), &quot;Mozart&quot; (1926), &quot;Trelawny of the &quot;Wells&quot;&quot; (1927), &quot;Escape&quot; (1927-1928), &quot;Napi&quot; (1931), &quot;Company&#x27;s Coming&quot; (1931), &quot;Springtime for Henry&quot; (1931-1932), &quot;When Ladies Meet&quot; (1933), &quot;False Dreams, Farewell&quot; (1934), &quot;Lady Jane&quot; (1934), &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1944-1945), &quot;The Mermaids Singing&quot; (1945-1946) and &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; (1948).

==Film==

Frieda Wrightman adopted her mother&#x27;s surname as her professional name and moved to Hollywood and made her film debut in &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; (1935). Her other films include &quot;Mary of Scotland&quot; (1936), &quot;Give Me Your Heart&quot; (1936), &quot;Beauty for the Asking (1939), &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940), &quot;The Trial of Mary Dugan&quot; (1941), &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941) and &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951).

She appeared with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson as the conniving Caroline Bingley in the 1940 film version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. She had a leading role in &quot;Call It a Day&quot;, a 1937 film in which she appeared with Olivia de Havilland, Bonita Granville, Roland Young, and Ian Hunter. In 1955 Inescort appeared as Mrs. Lawrence in the movie &quot;Foxfire&quot; starring Jeff Chandler and Jane Russell. She appeared in one episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Hope Quentin in &quot;The Case of the Jealous Journalist&quot; (season 5, 1961).

==Personal life==
On 2 August 1961, she and her husband since 1926, Ben Ray Redman, dined out. Redman had been despondent for some time. Returning home before her, he went upstairs to bed. He then called Frieda, informing her that he was depressed over the state of the world and had taken 12 sedative pills. By the time the paramedics arrived, he had died, a suicide at the age of 65. He had been working as a writer for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; and was involved in the translation of European classics into English.

Inescort had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1932. Her disease accelerated after her husband&#x27;s death, and she was using a wheelchair by the mid-1960s. On 7 July 1964, her estranged mother, British actress Elaine Inescourt, died in Brighton, England, aged 87. Frieda worked as much as possible for the funding of multiple sclerosis research. She was often seen in the Hollywood area seated in her wheelchair, collecting donations outside supermarkets and in malls.

==Death==
Inescort died at the age of 74 at the Motion Picture Country Home at Woodland Hills, California from multiple sclerosis.

<text>William Mark Goldman (born 1955 in Kansas City, Missouri) is a professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park (since 1986). He received a B.A. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1977, and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1980.

==Research contributions==
Goldman has investigated geometric structures, in various incarnations, on manifolds since his undergraduate thesis, &quot;Affine manifolds and projective geometry on manifolds&quot;, supervised by William Thurston and Dennis Sullivan. This work led to work with Morris Hirsch and David Fried on affine structures on manifolds, and work in real projective structures on compact surfaces. In particular he proved that the space of convex real projective structures on a closed orientable surface of genus formula_1 is homeomorphic to an open cell of dimension formula_2. With Suhyoung Choi, he proved that this space is a connected component (the &quot;Hitchin component&quot;) of the space of equivalence classes of representations of the fundamental group in formula_3. Combining this result with Suhyoung Choi&#x27;s convex decomposition theorem, this led to a complete classification of convex real projective structures on compact surfaces.

His doctoral dissertation, &quot;Discontinuous groups and the Euler class&quot; (supervised by Morris W. Hirsch), characterizes discrete embeddings of surface groups in formula_4 in terms of maximal Euler class, proving a converse to the Milnor–Wood inequality for flat bundles. Shortly thereafter he showed that the space of representations of the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus formula_5 in formula_4 has formula_7 connected components, distinguished by the Euler class.

With David Fried, he classified compact quotients of Euclidean 3-space by discrete groups of affine transformations, showing that all such manifolds are finite quotients of torus bundles over the circle. The noncompact case is much more interesting, as Grigory Margulis found complete affine manifolds with nonabelian free fundamental group. In his 1990 doctoral thesis, Todd Drumm found examples which are solid handlebodies using polyhedra which have since been called &quot;crooked planes.&quot;

Goldman found examples (non-Euclidean nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds) of closed 3-manifolds which fail to admit flat conformal structures.

Generalizing Scott Wolpert&#x27;s work on the Weil–Petersson symplectic structure on the space of hyperbolic structures on surfaces, he found an algebraic-topological description of a symplectic structure on spaces of representations of a surface group in a reductive Lie group. Traces of representations of the corresponding curves on the surfaces generate a Poisson algebra, whose Lie bracket has a topological description in terms of the intersections of curves. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian vector fields of these trace functions define flows generalizing the Fenchel–Nielsen flows on Teichmüller space. This symplectic structure is invariant under the natural action of the mapping class group, and using the relationship between Dehn twists and the generalized Fenchel–Nielsen flows, he proved the ergodicity of the action of the mapping class group on the SU(2)-character variety with respect to symplectic Lebesgue measure.

Following suggestions of Pierre Deligne, he and John Millson proved that the variety of representations of the fundamental group of a compact Kähler manifold has singularities defined by systems of homogeneous quadratic equations. This leads to various local rigidity results for actions on Hermitian symmetric spaces.

With John Parker, he examined the complex hyperbolic ideal triangle group representations. These are representations of hyperbolic ideal triangle groups to the group of holomorphic isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane such that each standard generator of the triangle group maps to a complex reflection and the products of pairs of generators to parabolics. The space of representations for a given triangle group (modulo conjugacy) is parametrized by a half-open interval. They showed that the representations in a particular range were discrete and conjectured that a representation would be discrete if and only if it was in a specified larger range. This has become known as the Goldman–Parker conjecture and was eventually proven by Richard Schwartz.

==Professional service==
Goldman also heads a research group at the University of Maryland called the Experimental Geometry Lab, a team developing software (primarily in Mathematica) to explore geometric structures and dynamics in low dimensions. He served on the Board of Governors for The Geometry Center at the University of Minnesota from 1994 to 1996.

He served as Editor-In-Chief of Geometriae Dedicata from 2003 until 2013.

==Awards and honors==
In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="1298825" wikidata="Q48763" url="?curid=1298825" title="Mohammad-Javad Larijani">
<text>Mohammad-Javad Ardeshir Larijani (; born ) is an Iranian conservative politician and former diplomat. He is currently a top adviser to the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in foreign affairs and secretary of High Council for Human rights, Judiciary of Islamic Republic of Iran.

He has been a key planner of Iran&#x27;s foreign policy, and led the ceasefire negotiations after Iran–Iraq War.

==Early life and education==
Mohammad Javad Larijani was born to Iranian parents and is a brother of Ali Larijani, former chairman of the Parliament and Sadegh Larijani, former chief justice. Larijani is a cousin of Ahmad Tavakkoli, who is the current director of Majlis Research Center.

Larijani, raised in a religious family, graduated from a hawza before starting his higher education in electrical engineering in Aryamehr University, wearing the uniform for the full four years. He later continued his studies outside Iran, and began to study in the PhD program in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. However, he did not complete his studies at Berkeley.

==Career==
Larijani is one of the top advisors to the supreme leader and the head of the human rights council in the judiciary. The council rejects and condemns appointment of Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran by United Nations and strongly opposes the western countries&#x27; positions about current human rights situation in Iran. Iran has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations, most recently after the November 2019 protests. The UN Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran has expressed &quot;The Special Rapporteur is shocked at the number of deaths, serious injuries and reports of ill-treatment of persons detained during the November 2019 protests. According to reports, detainees are being tortured or are suffering other forms of ill-treatment, sometimes to extract forced confessions. There are also reports of denials of medical treatment, including for injuries caused by the excessive use of force by the security forces, with some other detainees being held incommunicado or being subjected to enforced disappearance. He is concerned about reports that families of individuals killed by the security forces have been threatened not to speak out. He remains highly concerned about the continuing restrictions on freedom of expression.&quot;
Additionally Larijani has been the director of Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics in Tehran. Previously, he was a Majlis representative and the director of Majlis Research Center. He served as deputy minister of foreign affairs in the 1980s.

===Views===
In a 2010 NBC News interview, Larijani defended the arrest of Nasrin Sotoudeh, an Iranian feminist activist, and a prominent human rights lawyer. Sotoudeh was detained in September and faces trial for &quot;collusion against national security&quot; and &quot;spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic.&quot;. Larijani told NBC News that Iranian authorities believed that she was engaged &quot;in a very nasty campaign&quot; against Iran&#x27;s national security. Nasrin Sotoudeh works for Shirin Ebadi&#x27;s law firm. Shirin Ebadi is the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

In November 2011, Larijani claimed that nuclear weapons violate Islam.

In response to the Mahsa Amini protests, Larijani said on Iranian broadcast Channel 3 (Iran) which has been translated by MEMRI, &quot;[Mahsa Amini] was detained by the police, and she was in a classroom when she suddenly collapsed. The police were enforcing the limitation on public nudity. You may call it &#x27;hijab,&#x27; modesty, or whatever, but in all countries – without exception – there are limits on public nudity.&quot;

== Controversies ==
=== Views on capital punishment for narcotic offenses ===
Larijani has praised Iranian Judiciary for capital punishment of narcotic offenses. He has stated that the world should learn from Iran on this matter.

=== Views on Obama ===
Larijani has stated on Barack Obama that &quot;Since Obama came to office he spoke of dialogue with Iran, What has happened that this black &quot;nigger&quot; is talking about regime change in Iran&quot;. This racist statement was widely condemned by many Iranian politicians.

<text>Patrice L&#x27;Heureux (1 February 1972 – 7 October 2018) was a Canadian professional boxer.

==Amateur==
L&#x27;Heureux participated in the 1999 Pan American Games but was knocked out by Alexis Rubalcaba.

==Professional career==
On 13 November 2004, L&#x27;Heureux challenged Steve McKay (record 5–1) for the vacant Canadian heavyweight championship in Montreal. After knocking down McKay in the eighth round with a body shot, L&#x27;Heureux then knocked him out for good 27 seconds into the ninth round. However, in his first fight after winning the prestigious title in 2005, L&#x27;Heureux was viciously pummelled by American clubfighter Steve Pannell (33-8) to lose his undefeated ring record by a technical knock out at 2:31 of the first round. He beat undefeated Olympian Art Binkowski on points later that year.

The 6-foot 5-inch tall right-hander suffered his second loss when he was knocked out in the seventh round by David Cadieux on 12 May 2006. He lost the rematch on points. On 26 May 2007, he suffered his fourth loss to the undefeated Alexander Povetkin by a knockout in the second round. L&#x27;Heureux subsequently won four straight fights including two fights against Stephane Tessier. His first fight with Tessier earned L&#x27;Heureux the Quebec Boxing Council (CQB) Heavyweight Title. He died of a heart attack on 7 October 2018, aged 46.

His first sack came against Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Jeff Blake. He registered 2.5 sacks in his second season, and became a starter for the 2001 NFL season. He ended the season leading the team with 9 sacks. He was the NFL Defensive Player of the Month for September 2003, when he had 5 sacks, 21 tackles, 13 hurries and one batted pass during the first four games of the 2003 NFL season. He and fellow defensive end Julius Peppers were the only duo to register 10 sacks each. The following year, Rucker again won Defensive Player of the Month for September, becoming only the 11th player in history to win POTM honors for the same month in two consecutive years; former Panther Sam Mills won POTM in November 1995 and 1996. Rucker finished the season with 12 sacks, and earned his first berth in the Pro Bowl.

On December 17, 2006, in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rucker suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in his left knee, causing him to miss the remainder of the 2006 season. He returned for his final season in 2007, before announcing his retirement from the game on April 22, 2008.

<text>Ana Blandiana (; pen name of Otilia Valeria Coman; born 25 March 1942) is a Romanian poet, essayist, and political figure. She took her name after Blandiana, near Vințu de Jos, Alba County, her mother&#x27;s home village.

In October 2017, she was announced as The Griffin Trust For Excellence In Poetry&#x27;s twelfth recipient of their Lifetime Recognition Award.

In October 2024, her literary work was recognised with the Princess of Asturias Award.

==Literary career==

Ana Blandiana was born Otilia Valeria Coman on 25 March 1942. Her parents were Gheorghe (1915-1964), an orthodox priest and former member of the fascist Iron Guard who spent years in Communist prisons and died in an accident weeks after his release in a general amnesty, and Otilia (Diacu), an accountant. Her sister Geta was born in 1947. In 1960 she married the writer Romulus Rusan.

After her debut in 1959, in &quot;Tribuna&quot;, Cluj, where she signed for the first time as &quot;Ana Blandiana&quot;, she was published in the anthology &quot;30 de poeți tineri&quot; (&quot;30 Young Poets&quot;). In 1963, after a four-year interdiction due to her father&#x27;s status, she again published in &quot;Contemporanul&quot; (edited by George Ivașcu).
Her editorial debut took place in 1964 with the booklet of poems &quot;Persoana întâia plural&quot; (&quot;First Person Plural&quot;), with a &quot;Foreword&quot; written by Nicolae Manolescu. She became known for her &quot;Calcâiul vulnerabil&quot; (&quot;Achilles&#x27; Heel&quot;, 1966) and &quot;A treia taină&quot; (&quot;The Third Secret&quot;, 1969). In 1966, Blandiana appeared for the first time at the International Poem Contest (in Lahti, Finland).
In 1967, she settled in Bucharest; until the following year, she was one of the editors for &quot;Viața studențească&quot;, and then (until 1975) worked as editor for &quot;Amfiteatru&quot;. She gave two televised readings in 1969, in the company of Andrei Șerban and the actors Irina Petrescu, Mariana Mihuț, and Florian Pittiș.
Between 1975 and 1977, she was a librarian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Bucharest. In 1976, her works were first printed in a French translation, in &quot;Croisière du Club des Poètes&quot; by :fr:Jean-Pierre Rosnay (Paris); in 1978, she took part in the First International Festival of Poetry in Paris organized by the famed Club des Poètes.

In the late 1980s, Blandiana started writing protest poems against the communist regime.

In 1984 Blandiana&#x27;s poem &#x27;Totul&#x27; (&#x27;Everything&#x27;) was briefly published in the literary magazine Amfiteatru. &#x27;Totul&#x27; was a list of elements of everyday life in Bucharest at the time, composed as a comment on the contrast between the official view of life in Romania and the alternative perception of its monotonous shabbiness. The critical nature of the poem led to the edition of Amfiteatru being withdrawn within hours of publication with the editors being dismissed. Nevertheless, the poem appeared in translation in Western media and also had limited underground circulation in Romania.

In 1987 she published at the Sport-Turism Publishing House the book &quot;Orașe de silabe&quot; (&quot;City of syllables&quot;) where she writes about all the countries and cities of the world where she travelled: over 100. The same year, 1987, she is published in USSR, at Raduga Publishing House from Moscow, with the Russian title &quot;Стихотворения, рассказы, эссе&quot; (&quot;Poems, stories, essays&quot;). Even though the secret services of Ceaușescu (&#x27;Securitate&#x27;) attribute her a dissident status, in 1989 the Minerva Publishing House is publishing in the most popular mass collection &quot;Biblioteca Pentru Toți&quot; (&quot;Library for all people&quot;) an anthology of her poems. Her friends sustain that the book never seen the bookshelves of the libraries. However, &quot;Poezii&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;) has a &#x27;Foreword&#x27; written by Eugen Simion.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, she entered political life, campaigning for the removal of the communist legacy from administrative office, as well as for an open society. She left literary work in the background, although she did publish &quot;Arhitectura valurilor&quot; (&quot;Waves&#x27; Architecture&quot;, 1990), &quot;100 de poeme&quot; (&quot;100 Poems&quot;, 1991), and &quot;Sertarul cu aplauze&quot; (&quot;The Drawer of Applause&quot;, prose, 1992). In 1992 she advocates for the released from prison of old time Party member Gheorghe &#x27;Gogu&#x27; Radulescu, a former member of the Executive Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and protector of herself during the communist period.

Ana Blandiana has also published: &quot;50 de poeme&quot;, (&quot;50 Poems&quot;), 1970: &quot;Octombrie, Noiembrie, Decembrie&quot; (&quot;October, November, December&quot;), 1972; &quot;Întâmplări din grădina mea&quot; (&quot;Occurrences in My Garden&quot;), 1980; &quot;Ora de nisip&quot; (&quot;The Hour of Sand&quot;), 1984; &quot;Întâmplări de pe strada mea&quot; (&quot;Occurrences on My Street&quot;), 1988; &quot;În dimineața de după moarte&quot; (&quot;On the Morning After Dying&quot;), 1996; &quot;La cules îngeri&quot; (&quot;Angel Gathering&quot;), 1997; &quot;Cartea albă a lui Arpagic&quot; (&quot;Arpagic&#x27;s White Book&quot;), 1998. She has also authored 6 books of essays and 4 books of other prose writings. Her work was translated into 16 languages.

&quot;Ora de nisip&quot; (&quot;The Hour of Sand&quot;) has been translated into English by Peter Jay and Anca Cristofovici.

<doc id="1298854" wikidata="Q531282" url="?curid=1298854" title="Lee Patrick (actress)">
<text>Lee Patrick (November 22, 1901 – November 21, 1982) was an American actress whose career began in 1922 on the New York stage with her role in &quot;The Bunch and Judy&quot; which headlined Adele Astaire and featured Adele&#x27;s brother Fred Astaire.

Patrick continued to perform in dozens of roles on the stage for the next decade, frequently in musicals and comedies, but also in dramatic parts like her 1931 performance as Meg in &quot;Little Women&quot;. She began to branch out into films in 1929. For half a century she created a credible body of cinematic work, her most memorable being as Sam Spade&#x27;s assistant Effie in , and her reprise of the role in the George Segal comedy sequel &quot;The Black Bird&quot; (1975). Her talents were showcased in comedies such as the Jack Benny film &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1942) and as one of the foils of Rosalind Russell in . Dramatic parts such as an asylum inmate in &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; (1948) and as Pamela Tiffin&#x27;s mother in were another facet of her repertoire. She played numerous guest roles in American television, but became a staple for that medium during the two-year run of &quot;Topper&quot;. As Henrietta Topper, her comedic timing played well against Leo G. Carroll as her husband, and against that of the two ghosts played by Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys. Patrick lent her voice to various animated characters of &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; in the early 1960s.

== Personal life ==
Patrick was born on November 22, 1901, in New York City. By 1937, Patrick married newsman-writer-publicist Tom Wood, author of &quot;The Bright Side of Billy Wilder, Primarily&quot;, and remained married 45 years, until her death. They had no children. During her career in Hollywood, she was not in good standing with gossip columnist Louella Parsons, and this conflict kept her career stuck in the &quot;B&quot; ranks. Wood wrote a frank piece on Parsons which did not go over well with the columnist. 

Patrick was a Republican and was supportive of Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election. She was an Episcopalian.

== Acting career ==

=== Stage ===
Patrick debuted on Broadway in November 1922 in the ensemble of &quot;The Bunch and Judy&quot;, which ran for eight weeks. In September 1924 she returned to Broadway in an 8-week run of &quot;The Green Beetle&quot; at the Klaw Theatre, portraying the lead characters&#x27; daughter who escaped a murder attempt.

&quot;The Undercurrent&quot; was only the first of 5 plays in which Patrick honed her talent in 1925. &quot;The Backslapper&quot; (1925) was a political drama that ran for 33 performances with Patrick in a supporting role as Mrs. Kennedy. Patrick performed more comedy later in 1925: &quot;Bachelors&#x27; Brides&quot; was a farce in which she played a guardian angel; &quot;It All Depends&quot; was another comedy, The farce &quot;A Kiss in a Taxi&quot; completed Patrick&#x27;s stage work of 1925.

&quot;The Shelf&quot; (1926) ran for 32 performances. Patrick acted in three plays in 1927: the 12-performance comedy &quot;Baby Mine&quot;; the equally brief &quot;The Matrimonial Bed&quot;; and &quot;Nightstick&quot;, an 84-performance run through January 1928. The 24-performance &quot;The Common Sin&quot; was the only other play she did in 1928.

&quot;June Moon&quot; gave Patrick her longest run of her stage career, 273 performances in 1929 and 1930, and 48 performances in 1933. She rounded out 1930 with the 13-performance run of &quot;Room of Dreams&quot;. &quot;Privilege Car&quot; was her first play of 1931, but she soon was on stage in the musical &quot;Friendship&quot; and finished out that year with 17 performances as Meg in &quot;Little Women&quot; One of the briefest plays of her career was &quot;The Girl Outside&quot; in 1932, which ran for 8 performances; however, that one came on the heels of &quot;Blessed Event&quot; that had run for 115 performances.

After &quot;Shooting Star&quot; in 1933, and &quot;Slightly Delirious&quot;, her only play of 1934, Patrick began to look towards a film career. &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; and &quot;Abide With Me&quot; did not fare much better for her. She had a long run of 169 performances in &quot;Stage Door&quot; in 1936–1937, but only did one more Broadway play after that, the comedy &quot;Michael Drops In&quot;.

=== Feature films ===

Patrick had the starring role in her first film, &quot;Strange Cargo&quot;, an early American sound production for Pathé released on March 31, 1929. In this remake of producer Benjamin Glazer&#x27;s &quot;Missing Man&quot;, British actor George Barraud played her leading man. It was another six years before she made another film: &quot;The Casino Murder Case&quot; for MGM. She had a bit part as a nurse in the film, which brought her together for the first time with Leo G. Carroll, with whom two decades later she worked on the television series &quot;Topper&quot;.

She remained in Hollywood and appeared in &quot;Border Cafe&quot; (1937). Over the next several years, she played numerous supporting roles, without attracting much critical attention. Patrick appeared in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) as Effie Perine, the loyal and quick-thinking secretary of Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s Sam Spade. Perine was one of Patrick&#x27;s more enduring film characterizations. The same year, she appeared in a leading role as an intelligent, crime-solving nurse in &quot;The Nurse&#x27;s Secret&quot;.
Her other films include &quot;The Sisters&quot; (1938), &quot;Footsteps in the Dark&quot; (1941), &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942), &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; (1944), &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1944), &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (1945), &quot;Wake Up and Dream&quot; (1946), &quot;Caged&quot; (1950), &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; (1958), &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959), &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1961), and &quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot; (1964).

In the mid-1960s, Lee retired to travel and paint in Orange County, California, but was coaxed back one more time to Hollywood. Her final film role was a reprise of the character Effie Perine in &quot;The Black Bird&quot;, a spoof of the &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot;, starring George Segal as Sam Spade, Jr., who in the storyline was forced to continue his father&#x27;s work and to keep his increasingly sarcastic secretary; the film attempted to turn its revered predecessor into a comedy.

<text>Roswell Christopher Bottum (born July 1, 1963) is an American musician, best known as the keyboardist for the San Francisco alternative metal band Faith No More. He is also guitarist and co-lead vocalist for the pop group Imperial Teen, best known for their 1999 single &quot;Yoo Hoo&quot; used in the movie &quot;Jawbreaker.&quot; In addition to popular musical career, Bottum also scored three Hollywood movies and composed an opera entitled &quot;Sasquatch: The Opera&quot;, which premiered in New York in April 2015.

== Early life ==
Bottum was born July 1, 1963, in Los Angeles, California, to Mary (née Hustead) and Roswell Bottum II, both natives of South Dakota. Bottum has three sisters, Catherine, Elizabeth, and Stephanie. His father was a federal prosecutor for the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, who later went on to found the law firm Bottum and Feliton in 1981.

Bottum was raised Roman Catholic. As a child, he studied classical piano. Bottum attended Loyola High School, a Jesuit Catholic school in Los Angeles, from which he graduated in 1981. He moved to San Francisco shortly after graduating to attend San Francisco State University in 1981 as a film major.

== Career ==

Joining his schoolfriends Billy Gould and Mike Bordin in Faith No More in 1981 (replacing Wade Worthington), Bottum remained in the band until its demise in 1998.

In 1985, Bottum wrote the words to Faith No More&#x27;s first internationally-recognized song, &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;.

However, after 1992&#x27;s &quot;Angel Dust&quot; and its ensuing tour, Bottum&#x27;s input into Faith No More was reduced significantly. His keyboards, previously prominent in the band, were almost absent on &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime&quot; (1995). Bottum later explained that he suffered a nervous breakdown in this era and &quot;all of that [time] is a real blur for me.&quot; He was addicted to heroin and also experienced the death of his father and witnessed the aftermath of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide on Courtney Love (Cobain&#x27;s wife and Bottum&#x27;s close friend, and also an early singer for Faith No More).

In 1994 and 1995, Bottum formed Imperial Teen with Lynn Perko, another Bay Area music veteran. The band&#x27;s mainstream pop sound was a stark contrast to the aggressive metal of Faith No More, and is perhaps best known for their single &quot;Yoo Hoo&quot;, used in the 1999 film &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;.

In 2009, Bottum returned to Faith No More for a reunion tour, and in 2015, the band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Sol Invictus&quot;.

In 2013, Bottum moved to New York City and produced an opera, &quot;Sasquatch: The Opera&quot;. He wrote the music and libretto for the piece about the elusive beast of the forest, describing it as a dark and gothic fairy tale about a backwoods family and the relationship between a caged woman and Sasquatch. The opera premiered in Brooklyn in 2015 and went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in the summer of 2016 for a month of shows. Bottum also wrote a short-form opera called &quot;The Ride&quot; about the AIDS LifeCycle Ride, a charity bicycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a ride Bottum participated in twice. The piece was staged with two stationary bicycles onstage.

In 2016, Bottum joined the art music collective Nastie Band. The group features 85-year-old singer Chris Kachulis and Bottum&#x27;s long-time friend, visual artist Frank Haines.

In 2018, Bottum made his acting debut in Sebastian Silva&#x27;s feature film &quot;Tyrel&quot;, about racial tension in America. The ensemble cast features Jason Mitchell, Chris Abbott, Michael Cera, and Caleb Landry Jones. The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival and had a theatrical release through Magnolia Pictures in 2019.

Also in 2019, Bottum formed the band Crickets, a Brooklyn-based band, with JD Samson and Michael O&#x27;Neill. They released their eponymous debut record on Muddguts Records in 2020.

In 2020, Bottum released the song &quot;Daddy&quot; under the name Man on Man, with partner Joey Holman. The video for &quot;Daddy&quot; was banned by YouTube for &quot;violating rules of sex and nudity&quot;. The video was re-instated a month later on YouTube after receiving much criticism from the band and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

The second Man on Man single and video, &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re My Everything&quot;, was released by Bottum and Joey Holman in August 2020.

Man on Man released their self-titled debut album via Polyvinyl Record Co. on May 7, 2021. Their second album, &quot;Provincetown&quot; was released via Polyvinyl on June 16, 2023.
=== Film and TV scoring ===
Bottum composed the music for Craig Chester&#x27;s gay romantic comedy film &quot;Adam &amp; Steve&quot; (2005) and scored &quot;What Goes Up&quot; (2009). He also composed the music for the 2007 film &quot;Kabluey&quot;, starring Lisa Kudrow and Scott Prendergrast. Bottum scored &quot;Gigantic&quot; (2008), a film by Matt Aselton, starring Zooey Deschanel and Paul Dano. In 2010, he scored the documentary &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; about drummer Patty Schemel. In 2010, Bottum also scored &quot;&quot; for Nickelodeon. He has gone on to score the sequel to that film and &quot;&quot; for the same network.

== Personal life ==
Bottum revealed his homosexuality in a 1993 interview with Lance Loud for &quot;The Advocate&quot;. In a 2001 interview in &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Bottum stated that &quot;I would never have thought as a gay teen I&#x27;d be in a band that would be considered heavy metal or hard rock.&quot;

A 1999 article in &quot;The Advocate&quot; said of Imperial Teen, &quot;With lyrical allusions to wearing lipstick and male pronouns used to address love objects, Imperial Teen serves up a gay sensibility that ordinarily surfaces only from straight bands like Pulp or Pizzicato Five.&quot; Bottum noted &quot;I think there&#x27;s a resistance from gay artists to go that route just because it&#x27;s so predictable. But it is annoying to see bands play it as safe as they do these days. That&#x27;s why something that visually screams as loud as Marilyn Manson is such a breath of fresh air.&quot;

Before he came out as gay, Bottum was involved in a brief heterosexual relationship with Courtney Love in the early 1980s, concurrent with the time she sang for Faith No More. The two remain friends decades later.

<doc id="1298867" wikidata="Q1567954" url="?curid=1298867" title="Peach Melba">
<text>Peach Melba (, ) is a dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice cream. It was invented in 1892 or 1893 by the French chef Auguste Escoffier at the Savoy Hotel, London, to honour the Australian soprano Nellie Melba.

== History ==
In 1892, operatic soprano Nellie Melba was performing in Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Lohengrin&quot; at Covent Garden. The Duke of Orléans gave a dinner party at the Savoy to celebrate her triumph. For the occasion, Escoffier presented Nellie with a dessert of fresh peaches served over vanilla ice cream in a silver dish perched atop an ice sculpture of a swan, which is featured in the opera. He originally called the dish &quot;Pêche au cygne&quot;, or &quot;peach with a swan.&quot;

A few years later Escoffier created a new version of the dessert: when Escoffier and César Ritz opened the Ritz Carlton in London (after both were sacked from the Savoy for larceny, embezzlement, and fraud), Escoffier changed the recipe slightly by adding a topping of sweetened raspberry purée and renamed the dish &quot;Pêche Melba&quot;.

== Variations ==
Other versions substitute pears, apricots, or strawberries instead of peaches or use raspberry sauce or melted redcurrant jelly instead of raspberry purée. The original dessert used simple ingredients of &quot;tender and very ripe peaches, vanilla ice cream, and a purée of sugared raspberry&quot;. Escoffier himself is quoted as saying, &quot;Any variation on this recipe ruins the delicate balance of its taste.&quot;

===&quot;Pijama&quot;===
Peach Melba is claimed to be the ancestor of the &quot;pijama&quot;, a dessert in Catalan cuisine. 7 Portes, a famous restaurant in Barcelona founded in 1836, is credited with its creation in 1951, when officers of the U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed in the nearby harbor would often dine at 7 Portes and order peach Melba for dessert. The name mutated to &quot;pijama&quot; (, Catalan for &quot;pajamas&quot;) among the Catalan-speaking kitchen staff. From there the recipe, or the essence of it, spread throughout Catalonia. Variations are countless, but ice cream, flan, and fruit in syrup (peach or pineapple) are its staple ingredients.

Though regarded as an extravagant and somewhat outdated dish today, the pijama was considered part of the corpus of the Catalan cuisine and its recipe was included in the inventory published by the Foundation of the Catalan Institute of Cuisine and Gastronomical Culture.

==Cultural significance==
In tribute to Escoffier an elaborate deconstruction of the peach Melba was served as the last dish at El Bulli prior to its closure in 2012.

<text>&quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; is the second serial of the third season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Written by Terry Nation and directed by Derek Martinus, the single episode was broadcast on BBC1 on 9 October 1965. The only standalone regular episode of the show&#x27;s original run, it serves as an introduction to the 12-part story &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. It is notable for the complete absence of the regular cast and the TARDIS; it is the only serial in the show&#x27;s history not to feature the Doctor at all. The story focuses on Space Security Agent Marc Cory (Edward de Souza) and his attempts to warn Earth of the Daleks&#x27; plan to take over the Solar System.

After the show&#x27;s second production block was granted an additional episode, outgoing story editor Dennis Spooner commissioned Nation to write an extra episode as a cutaway to set up &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. Nation wrote the episode while considering a Dalek-focused spin-off; he used film character James Bond as inspiration for Marc Cory. &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; was produced by the same team as its predecessor, &quot;Galaxy 4&quot;, in a five-week period that concluded the show&#x27;s second production block; the two serials were held back to open the third season. Failing health prevented original director Mervyn Pinfield from continuing, replaced by Martinus. Production took place at the Television Centre in August 1965.

&quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; received 8.3 million viewers, a drop from the previous serial. Contemporary and retrospective reviews were generally positive, with praise for the script and direction, though some viewers were confused that the following serial did not immediately continue the narrative. The videotapes of the episode were wiped by the BBC in July 1974, and it remains missing with no remaining footage. Usually alongside &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; received print and audiobook adaptations, with off-air recordings used to construct the latter. In 2019, director Andrew Ireland and University of Central Lancashire students recreated the episode in live-action, replicating the 1960s production values.

== Plot ==
On the planet Kembel, Marc Cory (Edward de Souza) and Gordon Lowery (Jeremy Young) of UN Deep Space Force Group 1 are attempting to repair their spaceship to reach their rendezvous when they are attacked by the third crew member, Jeff Garvey (Barry Jackson), who was in a violent state of mind upon waking up in the jungle. Cory shoots Garvey dead when he was about to fire at Lowery. Bringing Lowery into the spaceship for debriefing, Cory explains himself to be a Space Security agent assigned to investigate a possible Dalek base for universal invasion with the presence of a Varga plant confirming their presence. Outside, Garvey&#x27;s body mutates into a Varga. At the Daleks&#x27; base, the Dalek Supreme is informed that representatives from seven planets will soon arrive, and sends a Dalek platoon to destroy Cory and Lowery.

Cory stands guard against the slow-moving Varga plants while Lowery finishes building a rescue beacon. They notice a spaceship flying above them, Cory deducing the Daleks are planning something big. As Lowery was about to record a message, Cory notices something moving in the jungle. Lowery and Cory flee as the Dalek platoon arrives and destroys their ship. In the Dalek base, the representatives from the seven galaxies have gathered in a conference room. The Dalek Supreme assures representative Malpha (Robert Cartland) that the human intruders will be dealt with. Cory is forced to kill Lowery upon discovering he became infected by a Varga plant and records a message, only to be surrounded by the Daleks and exterminated. At the Dalek base, the representatives approve an alliance, agreeing with the Daleks&#x27; plan to take over the Solar System.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
In October 1964, BBC Head of Drama and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; co-creator Sydney Newman had granted producer Verity Lambert an additional episode in the second production block to compensate for the second season&#x27;s &quot;Planet of Giants&quot;—the penultimate serial of the first production block—being cut from four episodes to three. As most stories were generally structured as four or six parts, this extra episode failed to fit the regular schedule. Outgoing story editor Dennis Spooner commissioned Terry Nation—creator of the Daleks and the writer of the first season&#x27;s &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1963–1964) and second season&#x27;s &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Chase&quot; (1965)—to co-write the third season&#x27;s &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot; (1965–1966), and it was decided the extra episode would be used as a cutaway to set up the 12-part story. By April 1965, Donald Tosh was in the process of replacing Spooner as story editor.

The episode was produced by the same team as its predecessor, &quot;Galaxy 4&quot;; they were the final to be filmed in the show&#x27;s second production block, but were held back to open its third season in September. Mervyn Pinfield—an experienced BBC figure who acted as the show&#x27;s associate producer from its origins to January 1965—was originally assigned to direct both serials, but his failing health prevented him from continuing, and Lambert brought on new director Derek Martinus to direct the five episodes. Martinus had recently completed the BBC&#x27;s internal directors&#x27; course and had no previous experience leading a television production. Having only seen a few episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Martinus reviewed some of the previous stories with Lambert; he found them disappointing, which shocked Lambert, but stated that he wanted to aim for higher standards. Though Lambert was credited as producer on &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot;—the final story for which she was credited—her role had essentially been replaced by John Wiles.

Nation was commissioned to write the episode on 25 February 1965; he delivered the script by 14 May, having been writing for &quot;The Saint&quot; at the time. He approached the episode as a technical problem, requiring a small cast and self-contained narrative. The success of the Daleks—particularly due to their imminent American debut in the film &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965)—led Nation to consider the viability of a Dalek-focused spin-off. In writing &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot;, he realised such a story would need a hero and wrote Marc Cory as a &quot;space-age Bond&quot;, inspired by the recent release of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964). The episode was originally set on the planet Varga, home of the Varga plants, but this was renamed Kemble (later spelled Kembel) during script revisions for &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. The episode&#x27;s draft script was titled &quot;Dalek Cutaway&quot;, while the rehearsal script received the name &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot;; the names were alternated and combined in internal documentation, and the final title has been the subject of much debate.

=== Casting and filming ===
&quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; was unique in that it does not feature any of the main cast or the TARDIS—the only serial in the show&#x27;s history not to feature the Doctor at all—a decision made partly to save money on their fees. Despite not appearing in the episode, William Hartnell was still credited for portraying the Doctor, while Maureen O&#x27;Brien and Peter Purves received credits in &quot;Radio Times&quot; as Vicki and Steven Taylor, respectively, but not in the episode itself. Young had previously starred as Kal in the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;; he was excited to work with Hartnell again but disappointed when he discovered his absence. Cartland had also appeared in &quot;Galaxy 4&quot;, directed by Martinus. The Dalek voices—provided by regular actors David Graham and Peter Hawkins—were pre-recorded in Lime Grove Studios on 4 August 1965.

The episode was Richard Hunt&#x27;s first on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as set designer; he made the jungle design, while series veteran Raymond Cusick on the rocket and message launcher, made both from stock set elements and by Shawcraft Models. For the Daleks&#x27; conference room, Cusick was inspired by the Nuremberg rallies. The episode used stock music composed by Trevor Duncan. Pre-filming for &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; took place on 25 June 1965 at Ealing Studios; the scene in which Garvey mutates into a Varga plant was recorded on 35 mm film. Rehearsals for the episode began on 2 August at the Territorial Army Drill Hall on Uxbridge Road, and the episode was recorded in Studio TC4 of the Television Centre on 6 August. The final scene of &quot;Galaxy 4&quot; was recorded alongside the episode so as to avoid re-hiring Jackson and rebuilding the set; the scene was later inserted into &quot;Galaxy 4&quot; during editing. Four of the Dalek props from &quot;The Chase&quot; were used in the episode. Recording for &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; cost .

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===


The episode was broadcast on BBC1 on 9 October 1965. Viewership dropped from the preceding serial, while the Appreciation Index remained reasonable at 54. 16 mm film recordings were made available for international sale, but the episode was never sold overseas, and BBC Enterprises withdrew it in 1974. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation considered the recording, but it was rejected by the Film Censorship Board in September 1966 as it was considered to constitute &quot;horror&quot;, particularly the masked aliens, Varga mutations, and dialogue about murder. The original 405-line tape was cleared for wiping in July 1969, and the episode was erased in July 1974. It remains missing; no known footage exists, though an off-air audio recording was made by fan David Butler.

=== Critical response ===
Bill Edmund of &quot;Television Today&quot; described the episode as an &quot;exciting start&quot; to &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;. Several viewers were confused by the lack of Daleks in the following serial—&quot;The Myth Makers&quot;, set during the Trojan War—and some felt that they had become less frightening. Conversely, some felt that the episode&#x27;s other monsters were too scary. In &quot;A Voyage Through 25 Years of Doctor Who&quot; (1988), Ian Levine praised the &quot;array of creatures&quot;, particularly the design of Malpha. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the episode as &quot;macho, with a sinister atmosphere&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the presence of the lead actors was &quot;hardly missed&quot; due to Nation&#x27;s script and Martinus&#x27;s direction, praising the tense atmosphere and set designs.

== Commercial releases ==
The story was novelised as part of &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan Part I: Mission to the Unknown&quot; by John Peel with a cover by Alister Pearson, published in paperback by Target Books and W. H. Allen in September 1989. An unabridged reading of the book was published as &quot;Daleks: Mission to the Unknown&quot; by BBC Audiobooks in May 2010 as a five-disc set, read by Peter Purves and Jean Marsh with Dalek voices by Nicholas Briggs.

Audio from the episode featured on the first CD of the five-disc soundtrack &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, released by BBC Worldwide in October 2001 with linking narration by Purves; the first CD was distributed with the magazine &quot;SFX&quot; to promote the full set. In April 2010, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; printed vouchers for readers to obtain the CD from WHSmith. A library edition of the audiobook was released by AudioGO in 2011, and Demon Music Group published it as a vinyl record in March 2019.

== Recreation ==
After writing and producing his doctorate thesis about a 1960s-style recreation of the 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot; at Bournemouth University in 2012, Andrew Ireland wrote a proposal to recreate &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; the following year and brought it to the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), but did not follow up; he specifically chose the episode as it was a self-contained story without any of the main cast. In mid-2018, when asked for an interview about his thesis by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, he revisited the idea. By now an academic and Pro-Vice Chancellor of Digital and Creative Industries at UCLan, he obtained permission for the recreation from the BBC and Nation&#x27;s estate, writing a passionate email to the latter, who were &quot;very supportive&quot;. With a support team at UCLan, Ireland began researching the project around this time.

=== Production ===
The recreation was created in about five days in February 2019, and the multi-camera shoot was done in three days from 20 to 23 February. It was filmed in colour and converted to black-and-white in editing; the on-set camera monitors also displayed the image in black-and-white. Ireland, who directed the recreation, used both the original camera script and a newly-formatted one. He edited the episode by placing it atop the original&#x27;s audio for the sequences to closely match. Several teams at UCLan worked in different departments, including costume design, fashion, make-up, and music; an external subcontractor constructed some of the sets based on the production team&#x27;s designs.

Mandip Gill, a UCLan drama graduate who played Yasmin Khan in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 2018 to 2022, sent a video message of support to the cast and crew alongside Thirteenth Doctor actress Jodie Whittaker. Peter Purves and Edward de Souza visited the set, and the former used his social media platforms to publicise the production. Janette Rawstron, the recreation&#x27;s lead make-up artist who taught Media Make-Up at the nearby Accrington and Rossendale College, considered Malpha the biggest challenge, as the heat of the lighting caused parts of the make-up to shift around. For the jungle set, Ireland borrowed a technique used in the 1982 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Kinda&quot;, spreading foliage across the studio floor; these were required to be moved to the side for the Daleks to move. Foliage and pot plants were sourced from around the university and from productions like &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Nicholas Briggs portrayed the Daleks in the recreation; he and Ireland met in 2013. Briggs felt the Dalek voices in &quot;Mission to the Unknown&quot; and &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot; sounded &quot;a bit more like&quot; actors Hawkins and Graham than the Daleks; he adjusted his ring modulator to avoid this, but attempted to recreate the original voices as closely as possible. James Burgess operated the Daleks and, alongside his father Mike, provided a blue-and-silver Dalek for use. In the recreation, Marco Simioni played Marc Cory, Dan Gilligan played Lowery, Jacob Marrison played Garvey, and Paul Stenton played Malpha. The Dalek set was used in one scene in the original episode, and later returned for use throughout &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;; however, due to the set&#x27;s complexity and infrequent usage, the recreation uses models instead, with full-size close-ups for shots of the Daleks. The model shots were filmed some weeks after main production.

=== Release and reception ===
The recreation premiered on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; YouTube channel on 9 October 2019 at 5:50p.m., exactly 54 years after the episode&#x27;s original broadcast. A behind-the-scenes documentary about the recreation, created by YouTuber Josh Snares, was released on YouTube. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Martin Belam described the recreation as &quot;effective&quot;, praising the Varga plants and Dalek death effect, but noted the source material itself was &quot;a bit stilted, stagey and even slapstick at points&quot;, calling it &quot;an interesting curiosity rather than a &#x27;must see. Erik Amaya of &quot;Comicon.com&quot; similarly felt the dated techniques &quot;make the 25-minute story feel slower than it actually is&quot; but this was &quot;the whole point of the project&quot;, lauding the accuracy of the recreation. The episode was awarded a Special Jury Prize at the Learning on Screen Awards in 2020.

<text>Nelahozeves is a municipality and village in Mělník District in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,200 inhabitants. It is known for the Nelahozeves Castle and as the birthplace of Antonín Dvořák, who is one of the most important Czech composers.

==Administrative division==
Nelahozeves consists of five municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Nelahozeves (1,018)
*Hleďsebe 1.díl (204)
*Hleďsebe 2.díl (44)
*Lešany (845)
*Podhořany (50)
==Etymology==
The name was derived from the personal name Nelahoda. It was the probable founder of the village.

==Geography==
Nelahozeves is located about north of Prague. It lies in the Lower Ohře Table. The municipality is situated on the left bank of the Vltava River. The highest point is at above sea level.

==History==
The first written mention of Nelahozeves is from 1352, when the Church of Saint Andrew already existed. The village was owned by the royal chamber and then by the Metropolitan Chapter at Saint Vitus. After the Hussite Wars, it was again property of Czech kings.

In 1544, Nelahozeves was acquired by Florian Griesbeck of Griesbach. He had built a castle here, the construction of which began in 1553. His son, Blažej, continued to expand the estate and completed the construction of the castle in its final form in 1613. After his death in 1620, however, he left the estate in debt, so it was bought by Polyxena of Lobkowicz in 1623. The estate suffered damage during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, but recovered in the second half of the 17th century. After the war, the castle was reconstructed by Václav Eusebius Lobkowicz, who used the castle as the centre for administration and management of his estates. However, the castle never served as the Lobkowicz family&#x27;s residence. The Lobkowicz family owned Nelahozeves until the establishment of an independent municipality in 1850.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Nelahozeves is located on the railway line Prague–Ústí nad Labem.

==Sights==
The main landmark of Nelahozeves is the Nelahozeves Castle. It is a Renaissance castle, built by the builder Bonifaz Wolmut in 1553–1613. The castle is an example of the &quot;castello fortezza&quot;, a design with faux architectural defenses, including decorative bastions and an entry bridge without a moat. The building is decorated by sgraffiti that depict scenes from Greek mythology and the Old Testament. The most noteworthy of the castle&#x27;s interior rooms is the Knight&#x27;s Hall, which dates from 1564. The castle was confiscated from the Lobkowicz family in 1948 and returned to them in 1993. Today it features an exhibition of historical period rooms, demonstrating the lifestyle of a Bohemian noble family in the mid-19th century. The castle also houses part of the Lobkowicz collection of paintings.

The Church of Saint Andrew is Gothic building, modified in the neo-Gothic style in the 19th century.

The birth house of Antonín Dvořák is a Baroque house with a small museum focusing on his life. Until 2019, it was operated by the National Museum in Prague; since 2019 it has been operated by the Lobkowicz family.

==Notable people==
*Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904), composer

<text>[[Topology]] is a branch of mathematics concerned with geometric properties preserved under continuous deformation (stretching without tearing or gluing).

Topology may also refer to:

==Mathematics==

*A topology is the collection of open sets used to define a topological space

==Electronics==

*Topology (electronics), a configuration of electronic components

==Computing==

*Network topology, configurations of computer networks
**Logical topology, the arrangement of devices on a computer network and how they communicate with one another

==Geospatial data==

*Geospatial topology, the study or science of places with applications in earth science, geography, human geography, and geomorphology
**In geographic information systems and their data structures, topology and planar enforcement are the storing of a border line between two neighboring areas (and the border point between two connecting lines) only once. Thus, any rounding errors might move the border, but will not lead to gaps or overlaps between the areas.
**Also in cartography, a topological map is a greatly simplified map that preserves the mathematical topology while sacrificing scale and shape
**Topology is often confused with the geographic meaning of topography (originally the study of places). The confusion may be a factor in topographies having become confused with terrain or relief, such that they are essentially synonymous.

==Biology==

*The specific orientation of transmembrane proteins
*In phylogenetics, the branching pattern of a phylogenetic tree

==Music==

*Topology (musical ensemble), an Australian post-classical quintet
* &quot;Topology&quot; (album), 1981 album by Joe McPhee

==Other==

*&quot;Topology&quot; (journal), a mathematical journal, with an emphasis on subject areas related to topology and geometry
*Spatial effects that cannot be described by topography, i.e., social, economical, spatial, or phenomenological interactions</text><links>

<doc id="1298881" wikidata="Q92678" url="?curid=1298881" title="Jason Rohrer">
<text>Jason Rohrer (born November 14, 1977) is an American computer programmer, writer, musician, and game designer. He publishes most of his software into the public domain (public-domain software) and charges for versions of his games distributed on commercial platforms like the iPhone appstore or Steam. He is a graduate of Cornell University. From 2004 until 2011 he practiced simple living, stating in 2009 that his family of four had an annual budget of less than $14,500. They have since relocated from Las Cruces, New Mexico to Davis, California. In 2005 Jason Rohrer worked on a local currency, called &quot;North Country Notes&quot; (NCN), for Potsdam, New York. In 2016 Rohrer became the first videogame artist to have a solo retrospective in an art museum. His exhibition, &quot;The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer&quot;, was on view at The Davis Museum at Wellesley College until June 2016.

==Games==
Rohrer has placed most of his creative work, like video games&#x27; source code and assets, into the public domain as he is a supporter of a copyright-less free distribution economy. Many of his project are hosted on SourceForge.
*&quot;Transcend&quot; – Rohrer&#x27;s first game, released in 2005. &quot;Transcend&quot; is &quot;an abstract 2D shooting game that doubles as a multimedia sculpture.&quot;
*&quot;Cultivation&quot; – Rohrer&#x27;s second game, released in 2007, is &quot;a social simulation about a community of gardeners.&quot;
*&quot;Passage&quot; – Rohrer&#x27;s third game, which was released in 2007 and garnered much attention from the mainstream and independent gaming communities. The game lasts exactly five minutes, and focuses on life, mortality and the costs and benefits of marriage. It was featured in Kokoromi&#x27;s curated GAMMA 256 event. In 2012 &quot;Passage&quot; became part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art.
*&quot;Gravitation&quot; – Rohrer&#x27;s fourth game, released in 2008. That same year, it won the Jury award at IndieCade.
*&quot;Between&quot; – Rohrer&#x27;s fifth game, released in 2008. It is hosted by &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot; as an adjunct to Rohrer&#x27;s profile in the December 2008 issue and was the inaugural recipient of the 2009 Independent Games Festival&#x27;s Innovation Award.
*&quot;Primrose&quot; – Rohrer&#x27;s sixth game, designed for the iPhone (although released for home computers as well). It was released on February 19, 2009. It is a departure from the art-game theme, and is a simple puzzle game.
*&quot;Sleep is Death&quot; – Adventure-game-making software, released April 16, 2010. Sleep is Death games require the creator to be present to respond to the player&#x27;s actions in near real-time. It has received favorable reviews from a number of mainstream game review sites.
*&quot;Game Design Sketchbook&quot; – In 2008 Rohrer created a number of games for &quot;The Escapist&quot;. These would usually be unpolished prototype games that explore a single theme, with an accompanying article by Rohrer describing the creative process of making games.
*&quot;Inside a Star-filled Sky&quot; – An &quot;infinite, recursive tactical shooter&quot; released in February 2011, favorably reviewed. Selected for presentation at the 2011 Tokyo Game Show&#x27;s Sense of Wonder Night. The game was put by Rohrer into public domain, like many other games of Rohrer.
*&quot;Diamond Trust of London&quot; – A 2012 crowdfunded two-player strategy game for the Nintendo DS into public domain.
*&quot;The Castle Doctrine&quot; – An MMO burglary and home defense video game. Sold on Steam while being public-domain software.
*&quot;Cordial Minuet&quot; – A two-player online gambling strategy game played anonymously for real money.
*&quot;One Hour One Life&quot; – A multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building, released February 2018. Like the games before, public domain software and hosted on GitHub.

==GDC 2011 Game Design Challenge==
At the 2011 Game Developers Conference Rohrer won the annual Game Design Challenge by proposing a game that could only be played once by a single player and then passed on to another. This idea was based on stories of his late grandfather that had been passed down. He stated &quot;We become like gods to those who come after us.&quot; With this in mind he created a &quot;Minecraft&quot; mod, &quot;Chain World&quot;, that was put on a single USB flash drive, which he then passed to an audience member. The rules of the game were simple: No text signs are allowed in the game, players may play until they die once, upon respawning they must quit the game and the game must then be passed onto someone that is interested and willing to respect the rules.

==GDC 2013 Game Design Challenge==
In March 2013 the Game Design Challenge was held at the Game Developers Conference for the final time. Its theme was &quot;Humanity&#x27;s Final Game.&quot; Rohrer was among the six contestants and won with his entry &quot;A Game For Someone&quot;, a physical game constructed of titanium. After its completion Rohrer buried it in an undisclosed location in the Nevada desert. At the challenge he released lists containing over one million discrete GPS coordinates, one of which was the actual burial spot. He estimated that with coordinated searching it would take at least 2,700 years to locate the game.

==&quot;The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer&quot;==
In February 2016, the Davis Museum at Wellesley College exhibited &quot;The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer&quot;, the first museum retrospective dedicated to the work of a single video game maker. The museum stated &quot;Rohrer&#x27;s exhibited work is deft, engaging, and often surprisingly moving. It refers to a diverse set of cultural influences ranging from the fiction of Borges to Black Magic; at the same time, it also engages pressing emotional, intellectual, philosophical, and social issues. Rohrer&#x27;s substantial recognition, which has included feature coverage in Wired, Esquire and The Wall Street Journal, as well as inclusion in MoMA&#x27;s initial videogame acquisition, has been built on a singularly fascinating body of games. These range from the elegantly simple—such as &quot;Gravitation&quot; (2008), a game about flights of creative mania and melancholy—to others of Byzantine complexity. The exhibition featured four large build-outs that translate Rohrer’s games into unique spatial experiences, alongside a section dedicated to exploring a large body of his work.&quot; The exhibit was designed by IKD, a Boston-based design firm.

== Personal life ==
In August 2005, Rohrer and his wife were arraigned for violating a local ordinance prohibiting grass taller than 10 inches. Representing himself, he successfully argued that natural landscaping had environmental benefits, and that the mowing ordinance was being enforced on them &quot;in a manner that violates the free speech, equal protection, and due process clauses of the United States and New York constitutions.&quot; The court found that the statute was overly broad, and he was acquitted of all charges on June 12, 2006.

<text>William Tenn was the pseudonym of Philip Klass (May 9, 1920 – February 7, 2010), a British-born American science fiction author, notable for many stories with satirical elements.

==Biography==
Born to a Jewish family in London, Phillip Klass moved to New York City with his parents before his second birthday and grew up in Brooklyn, . After serving in the United States Army during World War II as a combat engineer in Europe, he held a job as a technical editor with an Air Force radar and radio laboratory and was employed by Bell Labs.

Phillip and Fruma Klass married in 1957, and they moved in 1966 to State College, Pennsylvania, where he taught English and comparative literature at Penn State University for 22 years. His students who would go on to professional careers as writers included &quot;Rambo&quot; creator David Morrell, screenwriter Steven E. de Souza, technology writer Steven Levy and crime novelist Ray Ring.

Phil&#x27;s wife, Fruma Klass (b. 1935), grew up in New York City and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn College to work as a lab technician, a medical editor and a Harper &amp; Row copy editor. At Penn State, she was a writing instructor and a copy editor for the Penn State University Press.

When Phil Klass retired, the couple moved to the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon in 1988, and Fruma took a job as an editor with Black Box Corporation. That same year, her first short story, &quot;Before the Rainbow&quot;, was published in the anthology &quot;Synergy 3&quot;. In 1996, her second story, &quot;After the Rainbow&quot;, won a Writers of the Future prize; the story was published in &quot;Writers of the Future, Vol. XII&quot;. In 2004, she entered a worldwide essay competition, the Power of Purpose Awards, sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation. Competing against 7,000 entrants from 97 countries, she won $25,000 for her essay &quot;Streets of Mud, Streets of Gold&quot;.

Phil and Fruma Klass were members of the Pittsburgh Area Real Time Science Fiction Enthusiasts Consortium (PARSEC) and were frequent speakers at its local conference, Confluence.

Phil Klass was a Guest of Honor at Noreascon 4, the 2004 World Science Fiction Convention. He was the Author Guest of Honor at Loscon 33 at the LAX Marriott in Los Angeles in 2006.

He has published most of his fiction as William Tenn and much of his nonfiction as Phil (or Philip) Klass. He is sometimes confused with UFO debunker Philip J. Klass, who was born six months earlier and who died August 9, 2005.

Klass was related to other writers, including his nieces Perri Klass and Judy Klass, his nephew David Klass, and his brother Morton Klass.

He died on February 7, 2010, of congestive heart failure, and was survived by his wife Fruma, daughter Adina, and sister Frances Goldman-Levy.

==Writing==
Klass published academic articles, essays, two novels and more than 60 short stories. He began writing while working at Bell Labs, and his radar lab experience prompted his first story, &quot;Alexander the Bait&quot;, about a radar beam aimed at the Moon. It was published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (May 1946), and within months a Signal Corps lab bounced a radar beam off the Moon, making his story obsolete. He commented: &quot;It was a bad story, just good enough to be published. Others in the same magazine were much better, so I really worked hard on my second one. I did as well as I knew how.&quot;

Some of the nonfiction articles in the trade periodical &quot;TWX Magazine&quot; have been attributed to Klass during his employment at Bell Labs, although most were published without by-lines.

His second story, the widely reprinted &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1947), told of a lawyer who creates people with his Bild-A-Man kit, a Christmas gift intended for a child of the future. After publication in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (May 1946), Tenn was soon hailed as the science fiction field&#x27;s reigning humorist, and during the early 1950s, readers of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; looked forward to issues featuring his satirical science fiction.

Many stories followed, including &quot;Venus and the Seven Sexes&quot; (1951), &quot;Down Among the Dead Men&quot; (1954), &quot;The Liberation of Earth&quot;, &quot;Time in Advance&quot; (1956) and &quot;On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi&quot; (1974). One of his non-fiction articles, &quot;Mr. Eavesdropper&quot;, was later collected in &quot;Best Magazine Articles, 1968&quot;. His essay and interview collection &quot;Dancing Naked&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Related Book in 2004. He was given the Author Emeritus honor by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1999.

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; ranked Tenn as &quot;one of the genre&#x27;s very few genuinely comic, genuinely incisive writers of short fiction&quot;. Theodore Sturgeon summed up Tenn&#x27;s humorous viewpoint on life:
Tenn wrote two novels, both published in 1968. &quot;Of Men and Monsters&quot; is an expansion of his story &quot;The Men in the Walls&quot;, originally in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; (October 1963). &quot;A Lamp for Medusa&quot; was published as a double novel with Dave Van Arnam&#x27;s &quot;The Players of Hell&quot;. This novella was an expansion of his story &quot;Medusa Was a Lady!&quot; from the October 1951 issue of &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;.

==Theater==
In 1978, the University Readers at Penn State University presented a dramatization, directed by Joseph Wigley, of four of Tenn&#x27;s short stories under the title &quot;Four From Tenn&quot;. The selected stories were &quot;The Discovery of Morniel Mathaway&quot;, &quot;Bernie the Faust&quot;, &quot;The Tenants&quot;, and &quot;My Mother Was a Witch&quot;.

Pittsburgh&#x27;s Malacandra Productions staged a nine-character play adapted by John Regis from the classic Tenn science fiction short story &quot;Winthrop Was Stubborn&quot;. Directed by David Brody for the Three Rivers Arts Festival, this production ran from June 2 through June 17, 2006.

<text>Time in Advance is a collection of four short stories by American science fiction writer William Tenn (a pseudonym of Philip Klass). The stories all originally appeared in a number of different publications between 1952 and 1957. &quot;Time in Advance&quot; was first published by Bantam Books as a paperback in 1958 and also published as a hardcover in the United Kingdom by Victor Gollancz in 1963, followed a hardcover edition in 1964 published in the United Kingdom by the Science Fiction Book Club and by a Panther paperback edition in April 1966.

==Dedication== 
Tenn (the pseudonym of Philip Klass) dedicated the collection his wife, Fruma, while referencing the title story of the collection.

===&quot;Firewater&quot;===
A reprint of a story first published in February 1952 and featured as that issue&#x27;s cover story. Here, Earth is visited by enigmatic and uncommunicative aliens who ignore humans and simply observe. Those who do meet with the aliens, gain extraordinary powers, such as telekinesis, but in human terms, also go mad. Algernon Hebster is a highly successful businessman, owing mostly to his dealings with primeys, who supply him with the knowledge for advanced technologies which he puts to use in commerce. The problem is that primeys are so dangerous that dealing with them is highly illegal and every attempt is made to confine them to the reservations around their perceived alien masters.

===&quot;Time in Advance&quot;===
This story was published in the August 1956 issue of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. The story presents a future in which citizens serve out sentences for crimes they have not yet committed. Two &quot;pre-criminals&quot;, &quot;Blotto&quot; Otto Henck and Nicholas Crandall, manage against all the odds to serve out two full terms for murder in an off-world penal colony. They are returned to Earth as minor celebrities with the right to kill one person each.

===&quot;The Sickness&quot;===
This story first appeared in the November 1955-dated issue of &quot;Infinity Science Fiction&quot;. In the story, Earth finds itself on the brink of nuclear war between Russia and the United States. As a last-ditch symbolic gesture of peace and cooperation, the two nations launch a joint crewed venture to Mars. After finding an alien city there, a Russian and then American astronaut first come down with a sickness, then gain superhuman power.

===&quot;Winthrop Was Stubborn&quot;===
A story first published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in August 1957, under the title &quot;Time Waits for Winthrop&quot;. The future, via time travel, contacts the present. The present day travelers find themselves stranded in a hedonistic future. The oldest, Winthrop, refuses to return to the past thus leaving all of them trapped. In the present he was a bum, but in the future he&#x27;s a curio and encouraged to indulge his tastes to the point of gluttony.

==Reception==

Anthony Boucher received the collection enthusiastically, describing the two novellas included as &quot;models absolute of extrapolative wit and insight&quot; while finding the shorter stories &quot;of almost comparable quality.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The story &quot;Time in Advance&quot; was adapted in 1965 by Paul Erickson as one of twelve episodes of the first series of BBC anthology series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;. The episode survives, and has been released on DVD.

<doc id="1298895" wikidata="Q4107875" url="?curid=1298895" title="Scott Norwood">
<text>Scott Allan Norwood (born July 17, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a placekicker for seven seasons with the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He also played for the Birmingham Stallions in the United States Football League (USFL) for two seasons. As Buffalo&#x27;s placekicker from 1985 to 1991, Norwood led the league in scoring for the 1988 season and played in their first two Super Bowl appearances. Despite his accomplishments, he is best known for missing a game-winning field goal attempt at the end of Super Bowl XXV.

==Early life and college==
Norwood was born in Alexandria, Virginia and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria in 1978. He played both football and soccer at James Madison University and graduated with a business degree in 1982.

==Professional career==
===Birmingham Stallions===
Norwood began his professional career with the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League, playing two seasons before the Stallions signed Danny Miller to replace him.

===Buffalo Bills===
Norwood was one of many players the Bills picked up as the USFL contracted and ultimately collapsed; he eventually beat out Todd Schlopy (who would later come back when Norwood went on strike in 1987) for the Bills&#x27; starting kicker position. He quickly became an asset to an offense that was going places as the Bills&#x27; general manager, Bill Polian, assembled talent like Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, and Bruce Smith. Within two seasons of Norwood&#x27;s arrival, the Bills had won the AFC East for the first time since 1980 and made it to the conference championship game. He soon overtook O. J. Simpson as the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer. Following the 1990 season, the Bills advanced to their first-ever Super Bowl.

====Super Bowl XXV====

Norwood&#x27;s field goal range was unusually short for a professional kicker and he had difficulties in converting field goals over 40 yards throughout his career, especially on natural grass (the Bills&#x27; home stadium used AstroTurf, which mitigated this issue). Super Bowl XXV, which was played on January 27, 1991, cemented Norwood&#x27;s name in football history when he missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 8 seconds left in the game, giving the New York Giants their 2nd Super Bowl victory, and started the Bills&#x27; string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses. This kick was made famous by the &quot;wide right&quot; call by ABC announcer Al Michaels. Later video analysis revealed the holder mistakenly aligned the laces to the right, thereby positioning the kicked ball to fade right once in the air.

Although the Bills signed Björn Nittmo as Norwood&#x27;s potential replacement in the 1991 offseason, Norwood remained with the Bills through that season. The Bills returned to the Super Bowl and Norwood was perfect throughout the postseason, including a 44-yard field goal that served as the decisive margin in the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos.

Norwood was waived in the first roster move of the off-season after the Bills signed Steve Christie, formerly of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

==Post-football career==
After the Bills waived him, Norwood initially returned home to Northern Virginia and disappeared completely from the public eye for several years, eventually becoming an insurance salesman during the 1990s then moving back to Buffalo as a real estate agent in 2002.

==NFL career statistics==

=== Playoffs ===
==Personal life==
Norwood lives with his wife Kimberly in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Centreville, Virginia. They have three children: twins Carly and Connor (born 1995) and Corey (born 1996).[4]

==In popular culture==
In the 1994 film &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, a key plot point involves a kicker for the Miami Dolphins named Ray Finkle; in the story, Finkle misses a field goal attempt in the closing moments of Super Bowl XVII, causing the Dolphins to lose the game by a single point–an obvious reference to Norwood&#x27;s infamous kick in Super Bowl XXV. (In reality, Super Bowl XVII was contested between the Dolphins and the Washington Redskins; the Redskins won 27–17.)

The 1998 film &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; features a subplot where main character Billy Brown, played by Vincent Gallo, attempts to murder a former Buffalo kicker named &quot;Scott Wood&quot;, whose missed field goal led to Brown losing a large bet and serving a prison term when he took the fall for his bookie.

<doc id="1298898" wikidata="Q2941743" url="?curid=1298898" title="Catelyn Stark">
<text>Catelyn Stark (née Tully), later known as Lady Stoneheart, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. She is a prominent point of view character in the first three novels. She also appears in the fourth novel, &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005), and will return in a prominent role for the forthcoming sixth novel, &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;.

Catelyn is portrayed by Northern Irish actress Michelle Fairley on the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Fairley&#x27;s portrayal has garnered critical acclaim, with many praising her performance during the episode &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;. Due to this popularity, many fans were disappointed she did not appear again in the series despite the character&#x27;s resurrection in the novels. Author George R. R. Martin confirmed he argued against the decision, which he called &quot;the first major diversion of the show from the books&quot;, and the character being cut was ultimately made by the television showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.

==Character description==
===Background===
Catelyn was initially betrothed to Eddard&#x27;s older brother, Brandon Stark, the heir to Winterfell at the time. When Brandon was sadistically executed by King Aerys II, Lord Jon Arryn, the guardian of Eddard and Robert Baratheon, rebelled against House Targaryen. Soon after the rebels won the Battle of the Bells, Catelyn married Eddard, having never met the new groom before the wedding day, to consolidate the alliance between the Riverlands and the North. She was initially disappointed as Eddard was shorter and perceived to be less handsome than his brother Brandon. Still, she fell in love with him after seeing the &quot;good sweet heart beneath his solemn face.&quot;

===As Catelyn===
Catelyn Stark is described as beautiful, with fair skin, long auburn hair, blue eyes, long fingers, high cheekbones and full breasts, and dressed simply in the grey color of House Stark or the blue and red of her father’s House Tully. She is proud, strong, kind and generous, has a strong grasp of politics, and is often governed by the desire to protect her children. Catelyn is usually in accord with her husband Eddard Stark, but resents his admission of his extramarital son Jon Snow into their household.

===As Lady Stoneheart===
Having decomposed in the river for several days, half of Catelyn&#x27;s auburn hair had fallen out and what remained was completely grey. Due to her throat being cut, her ability to speak is greatly impaired. From clawing at her face after Robb&#x27;s murder, Stoneheart also has deep, gashing flesh wounds. She is a hooded woman, and has been mistaken for Beric Dondarrion&#x27;s lover.

Stoneheart has been described as having &quot;nothing of Catelyn&#x27;s mercy or kindness&quot;. Her objective as leader of the Brotherhood without Banners is to slaughter anyone associated with the Red Wedding. This includes anyone with the Freys, Boltons, or Lannisters. She has been dubbed an &quot;antagonist&quot; or a &quot;villain&quot;, especially an antagonist to Brienne. She is unable to speak properly due to her throat slashing, lending to one of her nicknames &quot;the Silent Sister&quot;. In order to verbalize commands, she must cover the wound on her throat with her hand. She is also referred to as &quot;The Hangwoman&quot; or &quot;Mother Merciless&quot;.

==Storylines==
===Book series===
====&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;====

After the royal party arrives at Winterfell, Catelyn receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn stating that the Lannisters had killed her husband Jon Arryn, the king&#x27;s &#x27;Hand&#x27; (second-in-command). King Robert Baratheon persuades Eddard to take his place. When her son Bran is injured and goes into a coma, she sits by his bed until they are attacked by an assassin who has come to kill Bran. Catelyn is wounded in the attack, and travels to King&#x27;s Landing to warn Eddard after recovering. There, her childhood companion Petyr Baelish tells her that the dagger used in the attack belongs to Tyrion Lannister. On her way back to Winterfell, she takes Tyrion to her sister at the Eyrie for trial, where Tyrion escapes execution by demanding and winning a trial by combat. After the news of Eddard&#x27;s execution by order of King Joffrey reaches Catelyn, she argues for peace, but is overruled by the newly crowned King Robb and his bannermen.

====&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;====

Catelyn advises against Robb&#x27;s plan to send Eddard&#x27;s former ward, Theon Greyjoy, to forge an alliance with Balon Greyjoy. Catelyn is sent by Robb to attempt an alliance with Renly Baratheon and his massive Reach-Stormlands host. Catelyn meets Renly at Bitterbridge and follows his host to the ancestral Baratheon seat of Storm&#x27;s End, where she witnesses first the unsuccessful parley between Renly and his older brother and rival claimant Stannis, and then Renly&#x27;s subsequent murder later that night by a shadow creature. Afterwards, Catelyn flees with Brienne of Tarth, one of Renly&#x27;s kingsguard, to Riverrun. Upon hearing of her younger sons&#x27; supposed murder at the hands of Theon Greyjoy, Catelyn goes to confront the captive Jaime Lannister. Although the novel ends her storyline ambiguously, it is revealed at the beginning of the third novel that Catelyn set him free and asked Brienne to escort him to King&#x27;s Landing in an attempt to exchange him for her daughters, who were still captives of Joffrey. This, however, causes problems for Robb and costs him an ally, House Karstark, which had held grudges against the Lannisters.

====&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;====

Catelyn&#x27;s brother Edmure Tully places Catelyn under house arrest at Riverrun, but Robb pardons her after he announces his wedding to Jeyne Westerling, invalidating his marriage proposal to House Frey. Lord Walder Frey agrees to forgive Robb if Edmure marries his daughter Roslin, and Catelyn travels to the Frey seat of the Twins to attend the wedding with Robb and other northern lords. However, Walder Frey and his men take revenge on Robb for his slight on their house by slaughtering the northern host, an act of treachery that became known as the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;. In an attempt to save her son&#x27;s life, Catelyn takes Aegon Frey hostage and kills him when Roose Bolton kills Robb regardless, but she still has her throat slashed by Raymund Frey. The Freys then mutilate Robb&#x27;s corpse, and throw Catelyn&#x27;s stripped naked corpse into the Green Fork in mockery of House Tully&#x27;s tradition of river burial.

Three days later, Catelyn&#x27;s body is washed ashore downstream along with hundreds of other corpses, and a wolf pack led by Arya Stark&#x27;s stray direwolf Nymeria is drawn to scavenge upon the dead. However, Arya is skinchanging into Nymeria at the time during her sleep, recognizes her mother&#x27;s body, controls Nymeria to pull it out of the river and guards it against other wolves until the outlaw band Brotherhood Without Banners passes by to repel the wolves. Catelyn is then resurrected by Lord Beric Dondarrion, who sacrifices his life force to revive her in repayment to her husband Eddard&#x27;s honoring. However, the period of time she spent deceased has caused Catelyn&#x27;s body to partly decay, disfiguring her looks; furthermore, upon her reanimation she loses most of her previous kind personality, except for her hatred of the Lannisters and the Freys. Catelyn then assumes command of the Brotherhood, and changes their aim to terrorizing anyone related to House Frey and Lannister. Her uncompromising brutality earns her the moniker &quot;Lady Stoneheart&quot;. Under her leadership the Brotherhood capture one of Walder Frey&#x27;s great-grandsons, Petyr Frey, demanding a ransom. When a son of Walder Frey, Merrett Frey, delivers the ransom he finds that Petyr has already been hanged and after he is interrogated he is hanged himself.

====&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;====

Lady Stoneheart has employed Tom of Sevenstreams to be her spy informant during the siege of Riverrun, where the Frey forces are commanded by Walder Frey&#x27;s grandson and heir, Ryman Frey. Stoneheart&#x27;s informant Tom acts as a musician, hired by Ryman himself. Tom jokes he will make a song called &quot;Talking to the Fish&quot; about Lord Emmon Frey&#x27;s speech to the people of Riverrun.

Inside a tent where Ryman entertains his whore, Ser Jaime Lannister notices Ryman is in possession of Robb&#x27;s bronze crown. When dismissing him for disobeying orders, Jaime instructs that the crown remain behind, and Tom gives an alibi for staying behind. Off-page, Tom then returns Robb&#x27;s crown to Lady Stoneheart. Jaime receives news that Ryman and all those accompanying him were hanged by the Brotherhood without Banners.

Stoneheart and the Brotherhood come across a small party led by Brienne, who informs Stoneheart that she is searching for Sansa at Jaime Lannister&#x27;s request. Brienne notices Stoneheart has retrieved her son&#x27;s bronze crown, and when inspecting it, Lady Stoneheart sheds a tear under her hood.

Brienne is named a traitor by Stoneheart because she carries Oathkeeper, a Lannister sword that was forged from Ned Stark&#x27;s Valyrian steel blade, Ice. Brienne swears that she is still faithful, but Stoneheart insists she must prove it by killing Jaime, whom she believes played a role in the Red Wedding (since Roose Bolton&#x27;s final words to Robb were &quot;Jaime Lannister sends his regards.&quot;). Stoneheart gives her the ultimatum: sword or noose. Brienne refuses, even when threatened with a hanging. Just before Brienne is to be hanged, she sees the young squire child Podrick Payne choking, along with Hyle Hill, and &quot;shout[s] out a word&quot; to intervene.

====&quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;====

Stoneheart is revealed to have spared Brienne, with the word shouted by Brienne evidently being &quot;sword&quot;. Brienne locates Jaime at a camp in Pennytree during the siege of Raventree, claiming she has found Sansa with Sandor Clegane, who are both a day&#x27;s ride away. The maid of Tarth warns Jaime that if he does not come alone, Catelyn&#x27;s daughter will die. Jaime agrees and leaves. Later, Jaime is reported to have disappeared for weeks, a sign he has been successfully lured into Stoneheart&#x27;s trap.

====&quot;The World of Ice and Fire&quot;====

The book states Tom O&#x27;Sevens informed the brotherhood of Jaime&#x27;s dismissal of Ryman, allowing the outlaws to ambush and hang Ryman near Fairmarket. However, in Brienne&#x27;s point-of-view in the fourth book, Tom states &quot;our lady&quot; (Stoneheart) had already gone to Fairmarket, because she &quot;never sleeps&quot;. This suggests Lady Stoneheart killed Ryman herself, and now sources differ (as &quot;The World of Ice and Fire&quot; is also written from an in-world maester).

====&quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;====

In a 2018 interview with the Chinese &quot;Esquire&quot;, author George R. R. Martin confirmed that Lady Stoneheart will reappear and have a prominent role in the forthcoming novel. He stated: &quot;In the sixth book, I still continue to write her. She is an important part of the entire book.&quot;

===Family tree of House Tully===
===Television series===
In January 2007 HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin&#x27;s series for television. Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and filmed her scenes in the unaired pilot until she eventually left for family reasons. Michelle Fairley was then cast in the role, which she played for three seasons. Australian actress Essie Davis, who later went on to portray Lady Crane in the sixth season, also auditioned for the role when the series was being developed.

====Season 1====
Catelyn&#x27;s storyline is abbreviated and has minor differences in the first season. Introduced in the pilot, &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;, Catelyn does not encourage Ned to journey south. Unlike her book counterpart, she is worrisome of the command due to the fates of his father, Rickard (Wayne Foskett) and Ned&#x27;s older brother, Brandon (unseen) when they rode south on the command of the Mad King, Aerys Targaryen II (David Rintoul). She also does not seem as encouraged to promote Sansa as a suitable match to be Robert&#x27;s son and heir, Joffrey Baratheon (Jack Gleeson)&#x27;s future queen consort.

The first season also excludes Catelyn&#x27;s extended family from &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), with the exception of Lysa Arryn (Kate Dickie) and Catelyn&#x27;s nephew, Robin (renamed from the novels; portrayed by Lino Facioli). Catelyn&#x27;s suspicion towards the Lannisters is motivated by a shred of blonde hair found where Bran fell from the tower, indicating the Lannisters&#x27; involvement (rather than Jaime refusing to join the hunt the next day). Additionally, Catelyn confronts Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) for throwing Bran from the tower by the end of the first season. Meanwhile, in the novels, Catelyn has gradually come to this belief over time in the first two novels, before Jaime admits it in his drunken state by the end of the second novel.

Another difference is Catelyn&#x27;s travel journeys. Her journey passing the Bloody Gate to meet Blackfish and later ascending the Gates of the Moon and meeting King Robert&#x27;s bastard daughter, Mya Stone (who is also excluded from the television series) is unseen.

====Season 2====
In the second season, some of Catelyn&#x27;s political decisions and discoveries are given to other characters. Her son Robb (Richard Madden) commands Rodrik Cassel (Ron Donachie) to go to Winterfell to serve as castellan. This is a change from the novels where Catelyn gave the order in the first book, following his injuries at the Vale, which was also removed from the television series. Catelyn&#x27;s realization of Stannis&#x27; part in killing Renly is given to Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie), who is also aged up for the television series.

A major difference is Catelyn&#x27;s motivation for freeing Jaime Lannister book-to-screen. This event occurs on television in the episode &quot;A Man Without Honor&quot;. In the second novel &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, Robb and Catelyn are informed that Bran and Rickon died, so Catelyn frees Jaime out of motherly grief for her still-living hostage daughters.

In the television series, however, Bran and Rickon&#x27;s fates are left unknown (but it is later eventually believed the boys died by &quot;Dark Wings, Dark Words&quot;, the second episode of the third season, long after Catelyn frees Jaime). Instead, in the television series, Rickard Karstark (John Stahl) wants to kill Jaime out of revenge for his secondborn son Torrhen&#x27;s death, and Catelyn sneaks Jaime out in the night to prevent a valuable hostage from dying. She reserves this information from Robb to maintain the Karstark alliance with the northern crown. As a result, Robb fulfils Edmure&#x27;s role in keeping Catelyn under house arrest until the war ends.

There is a difference in Catelyn&#x27;s locale. She is at Riverrun to receive Ned&#x27;s bones by silent sisters, whereas Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen) delivers them in the Stormlands shortly after her envoy mission to negotiate with the feuding Baratheon king-brothers, Renly and Stannis (Stephen Dillane). Similarly, she reunites with Robb while he is in the Westerlands to &quot;accept the surrender&quot; of the Crag, and meets his future wife, Talisa Maegyr of Volantis (Oona Chaplin), rather than discovering Robb&#x27;s marriage later (to a different character in the novels).

====Season 3====
The episode &quot;Dark Wings, Dark Words&quot; shows Robb and Catelyn receive seemingly definitive proof Bran and Rickon are dead. The timeframe, long after Jaime is released in the television series, is a major difference to the motivations that lead to Robb marrying his wife and Catelyn freeing Jaime. The third season also introduces Catelyn&#x27;s other family members, Edmure (portrayed by Tobias Menzies) and the Blackfish (portrayed by Clive Russell), who previously appeared in the first two novels, but were absent from the show&#x27;s first two seasons.

A major difference includes Catelyn&#x27;s feelings towards Jon Snow (portrayed by Kit Harington) prior to her death. In the third novel &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, Catelyn objects to her son King Robb&#x27;s intention to legitimize Jon and name him heir. She raises a point that Robb trusting Jon is not enough, stating children or grandchildren may rise up against Robb&#x27;s own children or grandchildren, and remarks the histories of the Blackfyre rebellion against the Targaryen crown.

However, in the show, Catelyn blames her lack of maternal love for Jon on the reason for her family&#x27;s tragedies and downfall. The television series reduces Catelyn&#x27;s fears of Jon as pure jealousy for his mother, rather than the other more complex reasoning in the novels, an attempt to maintain future dynastic peace.

During the television adaptation of the Red Wedding, Catelyn kills Walder (David Bradley)&#x27;s wife, Joyeuse Erenford (Kelly Long). This is a change from the novels where she kills Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s dimwitted grandson Jinglebell that she mistakes for a son, on the offer of &quot;a son for a son&quot;. After Robb dies in the television series, Catelyn goes catatonic, and the Freys seemingly had no intention to keep her alive, with one slashing her throat. Whereas in the novels, it is Catelyn&#x27;s face-clawing and laughter which points towards her insanity that leads to whispers of suggesting a mercy killing before she is finally killed.

====Season 4====
In the fourth season opener &quot;Two Swords&quot;, Sansa (Sophie Turner) mentions Catelyn&#x27;s body was thrown in the river. This is identical to the novels, as both showcase a mockery of Tully funeral customs.

However, the aftermath is drastically changed from book to screen. Following the fourth season finale episode, &quot;The Children&quot;, many fans expressed disappointment that Catelyn&#x27;s resurrection as Lady Stoneheart was not included. In the novels, Arya&#x27;s direwolf Nymeria retrieves her corpse from the Green Fork, and runs away when humans approach. It is later revealed the Brotherhood without Banners found her corpse, and Beric Dondarrion, a six-times resurrected man, gives her the kiss of life, passing on his power to her.

On the idea of portraying Stoneheart, Fairley joked in a 2013 interview: &quot;I&#x27;m completely insane, so it mightn&#x27;t be too much of an acting stretch!&quot; She elaborated further on the possibility stating: 
Neither showrunners explained the absence, but director Alex Graves explained in 2014 that they were &quot;not sure&quot; about what to &quot;do about it&quot; during production of the previous third season released in 2013. Then he revealed there were no plans for the fourth season, if ever. He also admitted that he was unsure of her purpose, while admitting he had not read the novels:
Showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss claimed they&#x27;d purposely left her out to avoid spoiling &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; and to minimize character resurrections in the series, despite arguments to keep her from author George R. R. Martin.

====Season 5====
In the episode &quot;Hardhome&quot;, the television adapted version of Arya does not choose the name Cat of the Canals, a secret tribute to her mother, when she poses as an orphan selling oysters. Instead, &quot;Lana&quot; is the name chosen.

====Season 6====
In the episode &quot;No One&quot;, Beric Dondarrion (Richard Dormer) is re-introduced following his last appearance in the third season. Being evidently still alive, Beric&#x27;s appearance negated much of the remaining fan speculation of a potential, delayed entrance for Lady Stoneheart. Actor Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson was also cast as Lem for the episode, an ode to one of Stoneheart&#x27;s henchmen, Lem Lemoncloak from the novels, and was quickly killed off. Following demand from fans of the novels, the actor agreed to videotape the monologue from the epilogue of &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; where he delivers the speech of Merett Frey&#x27;s execution by the command of his leader, Lady Stoneheart.

===Reception===
Fairley&#x27;s performance has received critical acclaim. The closing scene of &quot;Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things&quot; was praised by HitFix&#x27;s Alan Sepinwall, highlighting Michelle Fairley&#x27;s acting as Catelyn gathers allies to arrest Tyrion. &quot;Time&quot; wrote about &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;: &quot;Michelle Fairley’s fantastic performance captures the horror, with the edge of desperation, anguish, and madness of a woman who has lost her sons (she believes all of them), lost her grandchild, may have lost her daughters, and for all she knows, is witnessing the extinction of the house she belongs to.&quot;

*The &quot;Lariat&quot;: Since opening in 1968, Saddleback College has had a student-run newspaper, the &quot;Lariat&quot;. It is distributed most Wednesdays of the regular school year. It is printed at the Anaheim, California, facility of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, where 5,000 copies are made. During the fall 2005 semester, the &quot;Lariat&quot; chose to change its masthead to include Saddleback&#x27;s sister college in Irvine, Irvine Valley College, to appeal to a broader reader base and increase circulation. The change was met with opposition from members of Saddleback&#x27;s administration as well as from the Associated Student Government since Irvine Valley College did not contribute funds to the Lariat. Irvine Valley College now gives an allotted sum and the masthead continues to include both colleges. The Lariat was a National Newspaper Pacemaker winner in 1994 and a finalist in 1993, 1997, 2005, and 2006.

<doc id="1298906" wikidata="Q5489177" url="?curid=1298906" title="Frank Reich">
<text>Frank Michael Reich (; ; born December 4, 1961) is an American former professional football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played 14 seasons as a quarterback in the NFL. He became a coach afterwards, including head coaching stints with the Indianapolis Colts and Carolina Panthers.

Reich played college football for the Maryland Terrapins and was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the third round of the 1985 NFL draft. He spent most of his career backing up Jim Kelly, although he achieved recognition when he led the Bills to the NFL&#x27;s largest postseason comeback during the 1992–93 NFL playoffs, which was also the largest comeback in any game, including the regular season, in NFL history until December 17, 2022, when the Minnesota Vikings staged a comeback vs. the Indianapolis Colts, four games after Reich had been fired from his head-coaching position and been replaced by interim head coach Jeff Saturday. The Vikings&#x27; comeback was 33 points, one more than the Reich and the Bills&#x27; comeback in the 1992–93 postseason.

After retiring as a player, Reich began an NFL coaching career. Holding assistant positions from 2008 to 2017, he was the offensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles when they won their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl LII. He later served as the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts from 2018 to 2022 and guided the team to two playoff appearances. He was the Panthers head coach in 2023 before being fired before the end of the season after a 1–10 record.

==Playing career==
===High school===
Reich, who is of German descent, attended Cedar Crest High School in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, where he played baseball, football, and basketball. Reich started on the football team for his last two years in high school. He played quarterback in the Big 33 Football Classic in 1980 following his senior year of high school.

===College career===
Reich was accepted to the University of Maryland on an athletic scholarship and played for the Maryland Terrapins football team. He was both backup to and roommate of starter Boomer Esiason for three years.

The biggest highlight of Reich&#x27;s college career was the comeback he led against the Miami Hurricanes on November 10, 1984, at the Miami Orange Bowl. Reich came off the bench to play for Stan Gelbaugh, who had previously replaced him as the starter after Reich separated his shoulder in the fourth week of the season against Wake Forest. Quarterback Bernie Kosar had led Miami to a 31–0 halftime lead. At the start of the third quarter, Reich led the Terrapins on multiple scoring drives. Three touchdowns in the third quarter and a fourth at the start of the final quarter turned what was a blowout into a close game. With Miami leading 34–28, Reich hit Greg Hill with a 68-yard touchdown pass, which deflected off the hands of Miami safety Darrell Fullington to take the lead. Maryland scored once more to cap a 42–9 second half, and won 42–40, completing what was then the biggest comeback in NCAA history.

===National Football League===
Reich was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the third round (57th overall) in the 1985 NFL draft. The Bills had already drafted future Hall of Famer Jim Kelly in 1983 and when Kelly signed with the Bills in 1986, Reich was relegated to a role as backup.

Reich got his first start when Kelly went down with a shoulder injury in 1989. Reich led the Bills to two straight victories. He rallied the Bills in the fourth quarter by throwing two drives down the field for a 23–20 victory over the previously unbeaten Los Angeles Rams. This first game for Reich occurred in front of a Rich Stadium crowd of 76,231 and a Monday Night Football audience. In Super Bowl XXV, kicker Scott Norwood famously missed the potential game winning field goal wide-right, partially because Reich, as the holder on the attempt, mistakenly aligned the laces to the right, positioning the kicked ball to fade right once in the air.

Reich returned the following year, however when Kelly was injured again late in the 1990 season. Reich provided the Bills with two key wins, clinching them the AFC East title and home field advantage throughout the playoffs.

During the final game of the 1992 regular season, the Houston Oilers defeated Buffalo 27–3 in Houston, where Kelly suffered strained ligaments in his knee and yielded to Reich to finish the game in his place. With Kelly out, Reich took the reins as the starter for the wild card game the following week, on January 3, 1993. The wild card game was a rematch with the Oilers, hosted in Buffalo, where they led the Bills 35–3 early in the 3rd quarter, but Reich then led the Bills on a 38–3 run en route to a 41–38 overtime victory. The rally from a 32-point deficit remained the largest comeback in NFL history until the Minnesota Vikings made a 33-point comeback against the Indianapolis Colts on December 17, 2022. Reich started his second consecutive playoff game, as the Bills defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 24–3 in the divisional round. This made Reich one of a handful of quarterbacks who is undefeated as a starter in post-season play, as well as the only one with more than one start to his credit. Kelly recovered and started the AFC Championship where the Bills defeated the Miami Dolphins 29–10. During Super Bowl XXVII, the Bills faced the Dallas Cowboys and Reich again replaced an injured Kelly in the first half of the Super Bowl. Reich led the Bills to 10 points to make the score 31–17, with a possible comeback well within the Bills&#x27; capability as the 3rd quarter concluded. However, in the 4th quarter, the Cowboys scored 21 unanswered points to win 52–17, and Reich finished the game with two interceptions.

After giving the Bills one more comeback victory late in the 1993 NFL season, Reich signed with the expansion Carolina Panthers in March 1995 to start off their first year. He threw the first touchdown pass in franchise history to former Bills player Pete Metzelaars in Atlanta against the Falcons. Their first home game was in Week 3 against the Rams at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, as Bank of America Stadium was still under construction. The Panthers had drafted Kerry Collins as their intended franchise quarterback, but Reich was the starter for the first three games until Collins was deemed ready to take the starting job. He was sacked 9 times on September 3 at Atlanta, a franchise record he shares with Cam Newton.

Reich was signed by the New York Jets where he started for seven games in 1996.

In 1997, Reich signed with the Detroit Lions, reuniting him with his coach at Maryland, Bobby Ross. Reich appeared in 6 games in 1997, all in relief, and 6 games in 1998, including 2 starts. Reich retired following the 1998 NFL season.

In 2014, Pro Football Hall of Fame Executive Bill Polian, who was general manager of the Bills when they drafted Reich, called him &quot;the greatest backup quarterback in NFL history.&quot;

==Coaching career==

===Indianapolis Colts===
Reich was a coaching intern for the Indianapolis Colts from 2006 to 2007. In 2008, he served as an offensive coaching staff assistant for the Colts. After Tony Dungy retired following the 2008 season, former Colts quarterback coach Jim Caldwell took over as head coach and Reich became the new quarterbacks coach. Reich switched to wide receivers coach in 2011, but was dismissed when the entire coaching staff was fired after a 2–14 season.

===Arizona Cardinals===
Reich was the wide receivers coach for the Arizona Cardinals in 2012 under head coach Ken Whisenhunt, but along with Whisenhunt and other offensive coaches, was dismissed on December 31, 2012. Reich would not be retained under new head coach Bruce Arians.

===San Diego Chargers===
Reich was hired by the San Diego Chargers, along with Whisenhunt, in 2013. When Whisenhunt left to become head coach of the Tennessee Titans, Reich was promoted to offensive coordinator. On January 4, 2016, he was fired from his position as offensive coordinator after the Chargers finished 31st in rushing and struggled on offense.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
On January 20, 2016, Reich was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles He went on to win Super Bowl LII over the New England Patriots with the team in the 2017 season.

===Return to Indianapolis===
On February 11, 2018, he was named the new head coach of the Colts, seven years after he had been fired as wide receivers coach.

After losing his first career game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Reich earned his first win as a head coach over the Washington Redskins. In Week 3 against his former team the Eagles, with the Colts down 20–16 with seconds left in the game, Reich pulled starting quarterback Andrew Luck and put in Jacoby Brissett to attempt a Hail Mary pass from his own 46-yard line. Brissett overthrew several players in the back of the end zone and the Colts lost the game. The move was questioned by some journalists and fans, and led to some speculation about the health of Luck&#x27;s shoulder, although Reich and Luck both said it was purely because Brissett had a stronger throwing arm. The following week against the Houston Texans, Luck led the Colts back from down 28–10 in the third quarter, including a game-tying two point conversion with :51 left, however the team lost in overtime, 37–34. Reich was the center of controversy after Indianapolis failed to convert a 4th and 4 on their own 43 and the Texans kicked the game-winning field goal, although he afterward said &quot;I&#x27;ll just address it now. We&#x27;re not playing to tie. We&#x27;re going for it 10 times out of 10.&quot; After a 1–5 start, Reich led the Colts to a 10–6 record winning nine of their final 10 games.
Indianapolis became just the third team in NFL history to make the playoffs following a 1–5 start, and also reached their first postseason appearance since 2014. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the Houston Texans 21–7 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs 31–13 in the Divisional Round.

Following Luck&#x27;s unexpected retirement ahead of the 2019 season, Reich&#x27;s Indianapolis tenure became noted for quarterback instability, with the team starting Brissett in 2019, Philip Rivers in 2020, Carson Wentz in 2021, and Matt Ryan and Sam Ehlinger in 2022. 

Reich guided the Colts to a playoff berth in 2020, however Rivers decided to retire after the season, forcing the team to look for another starting quarterback. 

For the 2021, the Colts traded for Carson Wentz, whom Reich had worked with when he was the Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; offensive coordinator. Wentz did rebound with the Colts, leading the team to a 9-6 record and having a 98% chance to make the playoffs with two games remaining in the season, according to FiveThirtyEight. However Wentz faded at the conclusion of the season as the Colts lost both of those games, including a shocking 26–11 Week 18 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who entered the game with a league-worst 2–14 record. Minutes after that loss, the Pittsburgh Steelers, who needed Indianapolis to lose in order to clinch a playoff berth, won their overtime game against the Baltimore Ravens, thus eliminating the Colts from the playoffs. Colts owner Jim Irsay had lost faith in Wentz for a lack of locker room leadership and ordered his release, despite having no starting quarterback lined up yet. Reich had reportedly apologized to Irsay for vouching for Wentz.

For the 2022 season, the Colts traded for Ryan, whom Irsay considered a significant upgrade over Wentz. Following a Week 7 loss to the Tennessee Titans, Reich announced that Ryan had a shoulder injury and would be benched in favor of Ehlinger. After a disappointing 3–5–1 start to the 2022 season, Reich was fired on November 7.

===Carolina Panthers===
On January 26, 2023, the Carolina Panthers hired Reich as their next head coach. After a 1–10 start, the Panthers fired Reich on November 27. At the time of his firing, the Panthers offense was 29th in sacks allowed while rookie quarterback Bryce Young struggled with one of the worst passer ratings in the league.

Reich was the first head coach to be fired midseason in back-to-back years. His 11-game stint was the fourth shortest for a head coach in league history.

<doc id="1298912" wikidata="Q149234" url="?curid=1298912" title="Polabian Slavs">
<text>Polabian Slavs, also known as Elbe Slavs
and more broadly as [[Wends]], is a collective term applied to a number of Lechitic (West Slavic) tribes who lived scattered along the Elbe river in what is today eastern Germany. The approximate territory stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north, the Saale and the &quot;Limes Saxoniae&quot; in the west, the Ore Mountains and the Western Sudetes in the south, and medieval Poland in the east.

The Polabian Slavs, largely conquered by Saxons and Danes from the 9th century onwards, were included and gradually assimilated within the Holy Roman Empire. The tribes became gradually Germanized and assimilated in the following centuries; the Sorbs are the only descendants of the Polabian Slavs to have retained their identity and culture.

The Polabian language is now extinct. However, the two Sorbian languages are spoken by approximately 22,000–30,000 inhabitants of the region. The government of Germany regards Upper and Lower Sorbian as official regional languages.

== Tribes ==

The Bavarian Geographer, an anonymous medieval document compiled in Regensburg in 830, contains a list of the tribes in Central Europe to the east of the Elbe. Among other tribes it lists the Uuilci (Veleti) with 95 civitates, the Nortabtrezi (Obotrites) with 53 civitates, the Surbi (Sorbs) with 50 civitates, the Milzane (Milceni) with 30 civitates, the Hehfeldi (Hevelli) with 14 civitates and so on. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia classifies the Polabian Slavs in three main tribes, the Obotrites, the Veleti, and the Lusatian Sorbs.

The main tribes of the Obotritic confederation were the Obotrites proper (Wismar Bay to the Schweriner See); the Wagrians (eastern Holstein); the Warnabi (&quot;Warnower&quot;) (the upper Warnow and Mildenitz); and the Polabians proper (between the Trave and the Elbe). Other tribes associated with the confederation include the Linones (&quot;Linonen&quot;) near Lenzen, the Travnjane near the Trave, and the Drevani in the Hanoverian Wendland and the northern Altmark.

The Veleti, also known as the Liutizians or Wilzians, included the Kessinians (&quot;Kessiner&quot;, &quot;Chyzzini&quot;) along the lower Warnow and Rostock; the Circipani (&quot;Zirzipanen&quot;) between the Recknitz, Trebel, and Peene Rivers; the Tollenser east and south of the Peene along the Tollense River; and the Redarier south and east of the Tollensesee on the upper Havel. The Redarier were the most important of the Veleti tribes. The Rani of Rügen, not to be confused with the older Germanic Rugians, are sometimes considered to be part of the Veleti. South of the Rani were the Ucri (&quot;Ukranen&quot;) along the Ucker and the Morici (&quot;Morizani&quot;, &quot;Müritzer&quot;) along the Müritz; the former gave their name to the Uckermark. Smaller tribes included the Došane along the Dosse, the Zamzizi in the Ruppin Land, and the Rěčanen on the upper Havel. Along the lower Havel and near the confluence of the Elbe and the Havel lived the Nelětici, the Liezizi, the Zemzizi, the Smeldingi (&quot;Smeldinger&quot;), and the Bethenici. The middle Havel region and the Havelland were settled by the Hevelli, a tribe loosely connected to the Veleti. East of the Hevelli lived the Sprevane of the lower Dahme and Spree rivers. Small tribes on the middle Elbe included the Morizani and the Zerwisti.

The Sorbs confederation in the Elbe-Saale region included Citici, Serimunt, Colodici, Siusler, Nizici, Glomaci (&quot;Daleminzier&quot;) and Nisanen who lived along the upper Elbe, while the Chutici, Plisni, Gera, Puonzowa, Tucharin, Weta, and groups of Nelětici lived near the Saale. Joachim Herrmann considered that the core Sorbian tribes surely were Colodici, Siusler and Glomaci, and that they also settled and influenced around Magdeburg, Havelland, Thuringia and northeast Bavaria. To the East possibly later included the Lusici of Lower Lusatia and the Milceni of Upper Lusatia, while to the East of them were the Selpoli and the Besunzanen, and on the middle Oder the Leubuzzi who were associated with medieval Poland.

Small groups of West Slavs lived on the Main and the Regnitz near Bamberg, in northeastern Bavaria.

== History ==
The Polabian Slavs partly replaced the Germanic tribes who had emigrated by the 6th century during the migration period. According to radiocarbon dating, the first Slavs reached Southwestern Hungary, Suchohrad in Western Slovakia and Prague in Czechia in the first-third of the 6th century, and Regensburg of Northeast Bavaria in 568. The earliest dating of Prague-type pottery and sites between Elbe and Saale and Sukow-type in Northeastern Germany was found to be from 590s. However, palynology and other evidence show that the land in Germany became forested and not well resettled by the Slavs, with most material and sites dating since the 8th century.

Slavic settlement area was largely stable by the 8th century. Charlemagne enlisted the Obotrites as allies in his campaign against the rebellious Saxons of Holstein. Many of the Slavic tribes became dependencies of the Carolingian Empire and the Franks created the Sorbian March to defend against the Sorbs. Einhard in &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot; describes an expedition into Slavic territory led by Charlemagne himself, in 798. The Veleti noted as Wilzi (referred to themselves as &quot;Welatabians&quot;) were invaded by the Franks because of their continuous expeditions into Obodrite lands, with the Obodrites being allies of the Franks against the Saxons.

German campaigns against the Slavs began in earnest during the Ottonian dynasty. Henry the Fowler attacked the Slavs in several campaigns with his cavalry. During the reigns of Henry and his son Otto I, several marches were established to guard the eastern acquisitions, such as the Billung March to the north and the Marca Geronis to the south. After Gero&#x27;s death in 965, the Marca Geronis was divided into the Northern March, the March of Lusatia, and the Thuringian March, the latter being divided into the marches of Zeitz, Merseburg, and Meissen. Bishoprics such as Magdeburg, Brandenburg, and Havelberg were founded to support the conversion of the Slavs to Christianity.

After the defeat of Otto II at the Battle of Stilo in 982, the pagan Slavs rebelled against the Germans the following year; the Hevelli and Liutizi destroyed the Bishoprics of Havelberg and Brandenburg, and Obotrites (Mstivoj) destroyed Hamburg. Some Slavs advanced across the Elbe into Saxon territory, but retreated when the Christian Duke of Poland, Mieszko I, attacked them from the east. The Holy Roman Empire retained only nominal control over the Slavic territories between the Elbe and the Oder. Despite the efforts of Christian missionaries, most Polabian Slavs saw Jesus as a &quot;German god&quot; and remained pagan.

The Obotrite prince Udo and his son Gottschalk expanded their realm by unifying the Obotrite tribes and conquering some Liutizi tribes in the 11th century. They encouraged the establishments of bishoprics to support Christian missionary activity. However, a revolt in 1066 led to the murder of Gottschalk and his replacement by the pagan Kruto of Wagria. Gottschalk&#x27;s son Henry eventually killed Kruto in 1093.

From 1140 to 1143 Holsatian nobles advanced into Wagria to permanently settle in the lands of the pagan Wagri. Count Adolf II of Holstein and Henry of Badewide took control of Polabian settlements at Liubice and Racisburg. Impressed with the success of the First Crusade, Saxons began calling for a crusade against their Slav neighbors. The Wendish Crusade of 1147, concurrent to the Second Crusade, was largely unsuccessful, resulting in devastation to the Liutizi lands and forced baptisms. The campaign did secure Saxon control of Wagria and Polabia, however. The Obotrites were largely at peace with the Saxons during the following decade, although Slavic pirates raided Denmark.

Beginning in the late 1150s, King Valdemar the Great of Denmark enlisted the aid of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony against the Slavs; their cooperation led to the death of the Obotrite prince, Niklot, in 1160. The two Christian lords distributed much of the conquered territory among their vassals. When Niklot&#x27;s exiled son, Pribislav, engineered an Obotrite rebellion, the pair retaliated by occupying Demmin and warding off Pribislav&#x27;s Liutizian allies.

After conquering Wagria and Polabia during the 1140s, Saxon nobles attempted to expel the &quot;native&quot; Slavs and replace them with Saxon and Flemish settlers. The 1164 Obotrite revolt led by Niklot&#x27;s son Pribislav convinced Henry the Lion that keeping the Slavs as allies would be less troublesome. The duke returned the Christian Pribislav to power as Prince of Mecklenburg, Kessin, and Rostock, and a vassal of the Saxons.

Tactics and weaponry were decisive in Denmark&#x27;s campaigns against the eastern Polabian Slavs. The Danes utilized quick coastal and river raids, tactics similar to those of the Vikings. Although they lacked siege experience, the Danes were able to cripple Slavic regions by burning crops and unwalled suburbs. Slav counterattacks were repulsed by crossbows and Norwegian longbows. The Danes occupied Rugia in 1168, conquering the Rani stronghold of Arkona. Similar to Henry&#x27;s reinstatement of Pribislav as a Saxon vassal, Valdemar allowed the Rani prince Jaromar to rule as a Christian Danish vassal. After Valdemar refused to share Rugia with Henry, the Saxon duke enlisted the aid of the Obotrite confederacy and the Liutizi against the Danes; Valdemar ended the conflict by paying Henry in 1171.

Alarmed at the expansion of Henry the Lion&#x27;s power, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa deposed the Saxon duke and redistributed his lands in 1180/81. The withdrawal of Saxon support left the Liutizi and their Pomeranian supporters vulnerable to the Danish fleet. A Slavic fleet attempting to reclaim Rugia was crushed at the Bay of Greifswald on 19 May 1184. Danish monks engaged in missionary activity in Pomeranian abbeys, and Prince Bogislaw I surrendered to King Canute VI in 1185 to become the Danish king&#x27;s vassal.

Pribislav, a Christian prince of the Hevelli, bequeathed his lands to the Saxon Albert the Bear upon his death, thereby leading to the establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

The Lusatian Sorbs remained independent to a large extent. They were temporarily subdued by Charlemagne, but upon his death the links with the Franks were broken. In a series of bloody wars between 929 and 963 their lands were conquered by King Henry the Fowler and his son Otto the Great and were incorporated into the Kingdom of Germany. By the 14th century, the majority of Slavs living there had been Germanized and assimilated. However, the Sorbs, the descendants of the Milceni and the Lusici, have retained their identity within Lusatia, a region divided between the German states of Brandenburg and Saxony.

The Slavic language was spoken by the descendants of the Drevani in the area of the lower Elbe until the early 18th century.

== Society ==


===Princes===

A Polabian prince was known as a &quot;knez&quot;. His power was relatively greater in Slavic society than those of Danish or Swedish kings in their kingdoms, although it was not absolute. He was the general leader of his tribe and was foremost among its nobles, holding much of the forested hinterland and expecting reverence from his warriors. However, his authority largely extended only to the territory controlled by his governor, or &quot;voivod&quot;. Each &quot;voivod&quot; governed small territories based around fortifications.

Princely power often differed between tribes. The Obodrite prince Henryk was able to maintain a sizable army ca. 1100 at the expense of the towns, and the importance of &quot;knez&quot; within the Obodrites only increased after his death. The prince of the Rani, on the other hand, was limited by the local senate, which was led by the high priest at Cape Arkona; the Rani &quot;knez&quot; was essentially first among the tribe&#x27;s landowners.

===Towns===

The power of the prince and his governors was often restricted by the river towns, known to chroniclers as civitates, especially within the territory of the Veleti. Polabian towns were centered on small earthworks arranged in circles or ovals. The &quot;gord&quot; was situated at the highest altitude of the town and held a barracks, citadel, and princely residence. It was often protected by a moat, walls, and wooden towers. Below the &quot;gord&quot;, but still within the town walls, was the &quot;urbs&quot; or &quot;suburbium&quot;, which held the residences for the nobility and merchants. The towns often held wooden temples for Slavic gods within the &quot;urbs&quot;. Outside of the walls were homes for the peasantry. With the exception of Arkona on Rügen, few Polabian towns on the Baltic coast were built near the shore, out of concern for pirates and raiders. While not highly populated compared to Flanders or Italy, the Polabian towns were relatively large for the Baltic region, such as in comparison to those of Scandinavia.

===Peasantry===

The majority of Polabian Slavs were peasants in small villages who engaged in agriculture (rich in grains, flax) and animal husbandry (poultry, cattle). Some villagers were fishermen, beekeepers, or trappers. Farmland was divided into a unit called a &quot;kuritz&quot; (), for which peasants paid grain taxes to the &quot;voivot&quot;.

===Military===

Polabian society developed during the 9th and 10th centuries under pressure from the Holy Roman Empire and the Vikings of Scandinavia. They were often forced to pay tribute to the kings of Denmark, Catholic bishops, and imperial margraves. Polabian society became militarized and its leaders began organizing armed forces and defenses. Many Polabian magnates lived in forest fortresses, while towns were inhabited by warriors and burghers.

The magnates often raided Germanic territories or engaged in piracy. In times of large-scale war, the &quot;knes&quot; took overall command. The prince&#x27;s &quot;voivot&quot; ensured military service from the warriors and taxes from the peasantry. While the countryside provided land forces, the towns were known for their longships, which were lighter and lower than those used by the Danes and Swedes.

From a distance, Polabian fleets resembled those of the Scandinavians, although targets would recognize the Slavs&#x27; closely cropped hair and shrieking battle cries when they grew close. Polabian cavalry used small horses which were effective in quick raiding campaigns, but less effective against the Saxon and Danish heavy cavalry.

===Religion===

Religion was an important aspect of Polabian society. Much of their territory was dotted with holy places in nature to which the Slavs could pray and make offerings to Slavic gods. The priesthood was an important class which developed images and objects of worship. Polabian towns often included elaborate temples often visited for offerings and pilgrimages. In contrast, priests in the countryside often lived meagerly.

<text>Bhalchandra Trimbak Ranadive (; 19 December 1904 – 6 April 1990), popularly known as BTR, was an Indian communist politician and trade union leader.

== Personal life ==
He was elder brother of Ahilya Rangnekar, a CPI-M leader and 6th Lok Sabha member from Mumbai North Central (Lok Sabha constituency). They belonged to a Marathi Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu(CKP) family but Ranadive, a brilliant student, would teach Dalit students in his spare time.

== Political career ==
Ranadive completed his studies in 1927, obtaining an M.A. degree with distinction and in 1928 he joined the clandestine Communist Party of India. In the same year he became a major leader of the All India Trade Union Congress in Bombay. He was active with the Girini Kamgar Union of the textile workers in Bombay and with the struggles of the railway workers. He became the secretary of the GIP Railwaymen’s Union. In 1939, he married Vimal, a trade union activist.

In 1943 he was elected to the central committee of the party. In February 1946 Ranadive played a major role in organizing a general strike in support of the Naval ratings revolt.

At its 2nd Party Congress held in Calcutta in February, 1948 the party elected Ranadive in place of P.C. Joshi as its general secretary. Ranadive was the general secretary of CPI 1948-1950. During that period the party was engaged in revolutionary uprisings, such as the Telangana armed struggle. In 1950 Ranadive was deposed, and denounced by the party as a &quot;left adventurist&quot;.

In 1956, at the 4th Party Congress in Palghat BTR was again included in the Central Committee. He became a leading figure of the leftist section of the CC.

At the time of the Indo-China border conflict in 1962, Ranadive was one of many prominent communist leaders jailed by the government. In 1964 he became one of the main leaders of Communist Party of India (Marxist).

At the founding conference of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions in Calcutta May 28–31 1970, Ranadive was elected president.

== Commemoration ==
The central building of CITU in New Delhi is named after him— &quot;BTR Bhavan&quot;.

<doc id="1298920" wikidata="Q287082" url="?curid=1298920" title="Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)">
<text>Flesh and Blood (stylised as Flesh + Blood) is the seventh studio album by English rock band Roxy Music, released on 23 May 1980 by E.G. Records. It was an immediate commercial success peaking at No. 1 in the UK for one week in June and then returned to the summit in August for another three weeks, in total spending 60 weeks on the albums chart in the United Kingdom. The album also peaked at No. 35 in the United States and No. 10 in Australia.

The album was preceded by the single &quot;Over You&quot;, a No. 5 UK hit that also provided the band with a rare US chart entry at No. 80. Two more hit singles followed: &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; (UK No. 5) and &quot;Same Old Scene&quot; (UK No. 12, AUS No. 35). &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; also included two cover versions: the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; and Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot;. The latter was released as a single in some territories. In addition, the album&#x27;s title track along with the aforementioned &quot;Over You&quot; and &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; peaked at No. 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance charts.

The album was the band&#x27;s first without drummer Paul Thompson, whose departure reduced Roxy Music to a core trio of singer Bryan Ferry, saxophonist Andy Mackay and guitarist Phil Manzanera, augmented by session musicians.

==Cover artwork==
The album cover was conceived by Peter Saville and photographed by Neil Kirk. It features three young women holding javelins (two are on the front cover, one is on the back). Saville worked with no input from Ferry or the rest of the band, but continued the tradition for Roxy Music albums to feature images of women on the cover artwork. The model on the back cover is Roslyn Bolton (her modelling name was Ashley). The front cover models are Aimee Stephenson (at the front, died in 2002) and an unknown 18-year-old model, whom Bolton remembered years later as being named &quot;Rachel&quot;; Stephenson can also be seen in a Levi&#x27;s Route 66 commercial of 1976.

==Critical reception==

===Contemporary===
Roxy Music&#x27;s seventh studio album received mixed reviews from rock critics. Ken Tucker panned it in his &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, &quot;&quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; is such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination. The line on early Roxy (when Eno was a member) was that the band radiated high-tech decadence, and &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; connects with this historical interpretation by confirming the decadent part: e.g., what could be more outré right now than an art-rock disco album?.&quot; David Hepworth, writing in &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, said, &quot;Original followers [of the band] may find it low on character and surprise while lovers of the mighty &quot;Over You&quot; should be suckers for its mature, silky charms.&quot;

Greil Marcus praised the album: &quot;This record, all graceful lust and wistful regret, is pure romance; it’s also the best summer music anyone’s made since oil spills began undermining the concept ... &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; floats; it drifts; it fades away; it soars back. It captures the easy, endless promises of summer, and it captures the summer you’ve never gotten over; it works as soothing, mindless background music, and it can break your heart. Like a perfect July day, it makes no demands on a listener, yet it can give a listener everything.&quot;

===Legacy===
The &quot;New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; give it three stars and say &quot;&quot;Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot;, released after the band split up between 1976 and 1978, were good of their kind, but they lacked the spark that made some of the earlier albums so grand.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine states &quot;even the handful of undeniably strong moments can&#x27;t erase the feeling that Roxy Music were beginning to run out of ideas.&quot; Pitchfork rate the record a 6.6 (the lowest of any of the studio Roxy Music albums) complaining &quot;But the later material isn&#x27;t always worthwhile. There are moments on 1980&#x27;s &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot;, in particular, where the band stop sounding tired and start sounding bored, a fatal difference.&quot;

===Singles===
The singles released from the album have garnered more critical acclaim. The first single &quot;Over You&quot; is the only Roxy Music single included in Dave Marsh&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made&quot;. &quot;Over You&quot; is ranked at #511 in the book. Marsh writes &quot;Roxy Music from time to time produced slices of music that were compulsively listenable, adding a dangerous groove to a fantasy Top 40 (since none of them actually reached it, in the States at least) in which such ironic distance might have actually communicated something other than the performers&#x27; feelings of inherent superiority to the genres in which they trafficked. Invariably, these pieces presented themselves as singles. Among the more memorable were &quot;Do the Strand,&quot; and &quot;Love is the Drug,&quot; a trenchant satire (I think) of love songs and romantic love &quot;per se&quot;. Best of all, though, was &quot;Over You,&quot; its title a multilayered pun (which was perhaps even scatological in some dimensions), its topic an essence of banality, but its groove irresistible. Ferry&#x27;s singing succumbs to the seductions of the beat and actually shows some life, so that even though the lyrics are actually quite as predictable as they want to be, their juxtaposition with heavily romantic piano chords, synth riffs, and Andy Mackay&#x27;s soprano sax solo lends them a lush romanticism, as if the love song overlay were genuinely felt by all concerned.&quot;

Rob Sheffield wrote: &quot;Ferry had always founded his most arcane art notions on an unshakeable passion for pop. Roxy&#x27;s quintessential song from this era is 1980&#x27;s &quot;Over You.&quot; Ferry glides through the trance-like groove with the mantra &quot;Wish I was somewhere/Over You.&quot; until he starts ascending into the ether, leaving his fickle lover behind, soaring higher through glaze and gloss. Then the song fades out and Ferry starts the act again. This approach can get wearing, especially if you don&#x27;t believe that tears-in-my-caviar heartbreak is a spiritual quest. But when Bryan&#x27;s on, as in Manifesto&#x27;s &quot;Dance Away&quot; or Flesh + Blood&#x27;s &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, its impossible not to fall for him.&quot; AllMusic in a review of the single: &quot;Over You&quot; represents one of the crowning achievements of Roxy Music&#x27;s last years, a hauntingly hypnotic love song which spirals along on a warm bed of rhythm and guitar, interspersed with a few slabs of classic Roxy dissonance, and interrupted by some classic Beatles-ish guitar from Phil Manzanera.&quot; Greil Marcus wrote &quot;I was attracted to &quot;Over You&quot; the first few times it played by; now, when I hear Manzanera echo Ferry&#x27;s 3 A.M. piano, and then hear Mackay make his way out of the night to echo them both, the pattern repeating again and again, I swoon.&quot;

Jonathan Rigby praised the second single from the album, writing &quot;If &quot;Dance Away&quot; achieved Ferry&#x27;s long-held ambition and became accepted as a modern standard, it&#x27;s hard to see why the same accolade has yet to be bestowed on &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, which is perhaps the most limpidly beautiful ballad in his portfolio.&quot; AllMusic in its review states &quot;The sequence of exquisite singles that Roxy Music rattled off as the late &#x27;70s became the early &#x27;80s was highlighted by any number of songs which, dispassionately, could be ranked among Bryan Ferry&#x27;s purest pop visions yet. &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; surely edges them all, however, not only for its own understanding of the genre&#x27;s traditions (an everyday story of boy meets girl, in car with radio), but also via its reinvention over a decade later, when London Suede (surely the most convincing of all Roxy&#x27;s stylistic heirs) borrowed both a lyric and the mood for their own &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;.&quot;

David Buckley wrote: &quot;The third single, &quot;Same Old Scene&quot;, was the best of the three. Roxy&#x27;s most perfect dance record, its unstoppable groove, funky, Chic-like bass and blasts of Sax made it another sizeable hit ... That single, more than any other from the Roxy oeuvre, appeared to have been internalized by the incipient London club scene at the time. By 1981, the charts would be full of songs with a similarly musical trajectory: rumbling disco bass, clipped, riffy guitar and a smooth vocal over the top.&quot; Paul Stump in &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; says the song &quot;was imprinted upon every new popster&#x27;s eardrum almost immediately, most notably upon Duran Duran who first built a debut single (Planet Earth) and then a career upon this one brief moment of Roxy Music studio harmonization.&quot;

==Live performances and tour==
Just over half of this album has been played live over the course of the band&#x27;s career, most of the performances coming from the then &quot;Roxy Music Flesh + Blood&quot; tour in 1980–81 supporting the album. The tour had to have some dates cancelled due to Bryan Ferry having a kidney infection. The band performed &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; after John Lennon was murdered. This tribute performance was the inspiration for the band to record the song and release it as a single.

<doc id="1298932" wikidata="Q1428100" url="?curid=1298932" title="Flesh &amp; Blood (Poison album)">
<text>Flesh &amp; Blood is the third studio album by American glam metal band Poison, released on July 2, 1990, through Enigma Records and Capitol Records. It peaked at number 2 on the Billboard charts
and more than 7.2 million copies were sold worldwide. It peaked at number 1 on the Cash Box charts.

The album was an attempt by the band to establish a more serious musical stance, more than just the hair metal party dynamic of 1988&#x27;s &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot;. It spawned two top 10 singles, &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot; and &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; and three other hit singles, &quot;Ride the Wind&quot;, &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, and &quot;(Flesh &amp; Blood) Sacrifice&quot;.

It was certified Platinum in 1990 and triple Platinum in 1991 by the RIAA. It has been certified 4× Platinum by CAN and Gold by BPI.

==Production and marketing==
The album was recorded and mixed at Little Mountain Sound Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Canadian producer Bruce Fairbairn and mixer Mike Fraser.

The front cover art features the Poison logo and album title as a tattoo on drummer Rikki Rockett&#x27;s arm. The cover was originally planned to have a slightly different version of the tattoo after being freshly inked, with inflamed red skin with dripping ink or blood. The original cover was released for the initial pressing in Japan but was removed from all later pressings including those in Japan. The record&#x27;s marketing reflected the end of Poison&#x27;s glam image, including excessive make-up and teased, girlish hair as with &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot;, instead being similar to Guns N&#x27; Roses.

==Songs==
Parts of the album are darker and more serious, including overcoming hard times, missing loved ones, long-term relationships, and mass sociopolitical disillusionment. Fun topics include sex, exhilaration from music or motorbikes, and tongue-in-cheek poverty. Some songs have a blues rock style.

The meaning of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Unskinny Bop&quot;, one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, is obscure. DeVille later confessed that the phrase &quot;unskinny bop&quot; has no particular meaning. He devised it as a temporary measure while writing the song, before vocalist Bret Michaels had begun working on the lyrics. The phrase was used on the basis that it was phonetically suited to the music. The song was later played to producer Fairbairn, who stated that although he did not know what an &quot;unskinny bop&quot; was, the phrase was perfect.

==Accolades==
&quot;Flesh &amp; Blood&quot; was voted Best Album in &quot;Circus&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1990 Readers&#x27; Poll, and the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; was voted Best Single.

The album yielded three &quot;Metal Edge&quot; Readers&#x27; Choice Awards in 1990: Album of the Year, and &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; for Song of the Year and Best Video.

<doc id="1298941" wikidata="Q2989077" url="?curid=1298941" title="Porenut">
<text>Porenut (, ) is a god with unknown functions mentioned in only two sources: &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; and in &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot;. The only historical information about this god is the description of a statue depicting him with four faces on his head and a fifth face on his chest, which was held by his chin with his right hand and his forehead with his left hand.

== Sources ==
The first source to mention Porenut is the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus. Saxo describes when, after Arkona was captured by the Danish king Valdemar I, its inhabitants made an agreement with him, which encourages the inhabitants of Charenza to make a similar agreement and surrender the city without a fight. Saxo describes that in this gord (stronghold) there were three temples dedicated to Rugiaevit, Porevit and Porenut. After the destruction of the temple and the ideol of Rugiaevit by the Danes, Saxo writes:

The same information is then given by the &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot;, which lists Porenut in the distorted form &quot;Turupit&quot; (Old Icelandic: &quot;Turupið&quot;).

== Interpretations ==

There are two main ways to interpret the Latinized theonym &quot;Porenutius&quot;. One reading of the name is &quot;Porenits&quot;. In this case the name of this god would literally mean &quot;son of Perun&quot; and would have originated in the following way: Proto-Slavic &quot;*Perunъ&quot; &quot;god of the storm&quot; → Old Polabian &quot;*P&#x27;orěn&quot; (with Lekhitic apophony &quot;e&quot; → &quot;&#x27;o&quot;) → &quot;*P&#x27;orěnitjь&quot;. The Proto-Slavic suffix &quot;*-itjь&quot; has a patronymic function, i.e., a name or surname supplemented with this suffix means that it originated from a father&#x27;s name (cf. Svarog → Svarozhits), and in the Old Polabian it is continued as &quot;*-ūt&quot;, &quot;*-yt&quot;, &quot;*-ic&quot;, which most probably in Latin was written as &quot;-utius-&quot;, &quot;-ucius-&quot;.

The first part is also sometimes connected with the word &quot;pora&quot; in its original, Proto-Slavic (&quot;*pora&quot;) meaning &quot;push, thrust&quot;, &quot;force, effort, full strength&quot;, &quot;period of effort, hard work&quot;. According to Jacek Banaszkiewicz, a Polish professor of medieval history, the three Charenza deities are not a &quot;random&quot; group of deities, but a group of deities that patronize areas fundamental to the existence of society. He considers Rugiaevit as the chief god, who patronizes war and the community, and Porevit and Porenut as divine twins, who complement the chief deity with their universal characteristics. Banaszkiewicz points out that a common feature of divine twins is the repetition of the first part of the name or the second part of the name; according to him, Porevit and Porenut share the first part (&quot;pora&quot;). He also points out that twins often have contradictory features; Porevit is considered a &quot;positive&quot; twin whose name should be understood as &quot;Lord of strength, Lord who can cope with everything&quot; (the suffix -vit &quot;lord, ruler, master&quot;), while Porenut is considered a &quot;negative&quot; twin and translates his name as &quot;Lord in need of support&quot;, reading the suffix &quot;-nut&quot; as &quot;-nud&quot; and connecting it with the Old Polish &quot;nuda&quot; and the German &quot;Nut&quot; meaning &quot;need, compulsion&quot;. Banaszkiewicz also points to the fact that they both have five faces, two less than Rugiaevit, with Porenut having only four faces on his head, and the fifth one he holds with his hands on his chest, which according to him may indicate that his character&#x27;s importance is diminished in relation to Porevit. It may also be important that the right hand supports the fifth face, while the left hand holds it by the forehead. Andrzej Szyjewski is also in favor of combining the first part of both Porevit and Porenut with the word &quot;pora&quot;.

<text>DAW Books is an American science fiction and fantasy publisher, founded by Donald A. Wollheim, along with his wife, Elsie B. Wollheim, following his departure from Ace Books in 1971. The company claims to be &quot;the first publishing company ever devoted exclusively to science fiction and fantasy.&quot; The first DAW Book published was the 1972 short story collection &quot;Spell of the Witch World&quot; by Andre Norton.

In its early years under the leadership of Wollheim and his wife Elsie, DAW gained a reputation of publishing popular, though not always critically acclaimed, works of science fiction and fantasy. Nevertheless, in the 1970s the company published numerous books by award-winning authors such as Marion Zimmer Bradley, Fritz Leiber, Jerry Pournelle, and Roger Zelazny. In 1982, C. J. Cherryh&#x27;s &quot;Downbelow Station&quot; became the first DAW book to win the Hugo Award for best novel.

Until June 1984, all DAW books were characterized by yellow spines, and a prominent yellow cover box containing the company&#x27;s logo as well as a chronological publication number. When the design was changed, the chronological number was retained, but moved to the copyright page and renamed the DAW Collectors&#x27; Book Number. Although it has a distribution relationship with Penguin Group and is headquartered in Penguin USA&#x27;s offices in New York City, DAW is editorially independent and, until 2022, was closely held by its current publishers, Betsy Wollheim (Donald&#x27;s daughter) and Sheila E. Gilbert.

In July 2022, DAW was acquired by Astra Publishing.

<doc id="1298946" wikidata="Q578135" url="?curid=1298946" title="Manik Sarkar">
<text>Manik Sarkar (born 22 January 1949) is an Indian communist politician who served as the Chief Minister of Tripura from March 1998 to March 2018. He is a Politburo member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). In March 2008, he was sworn in as leader of Left Front, the Tripura coalition government. In assembly elections held in 2013, he became the chief minister for the fourth consecutive time. He served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tripura Legislative Assembly from 2018 to 2023. NDTV&#x27;s article in 2018, proclaimed that back then, he was the poorest chief minister in India with bank balance of Rs. 2000 (~25 USD).

His affidavit for the 2018 Tripura Assembly election revealed that he is the chief minister with the least possessions among all his counterparts in India.

==Early life and background==
Manik Sarkar was born into a middle-class family. His father, Amulya Sarkar, worked as a tailor, while his mother, Anjali Sarkar, was a State and later Provincial government employee. Sarkar became active in student movements in his student days, and in 1968, at the age of 19, he became a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was a candidate of the Students&#x27; Federation of India throughout his academic life at MBB College, from where he graduated with a B. Com. degree. During his first year at the college there came the turbulent times of the food movement of 1967, campaigning against the policy of the then Congress government of Tripura, and Sarkar threw himself headlong into the related student struggle. His vigorous role in this mass movement led him to join the Communists. Due to his early political exposure, he also became the General Secretary of the MBB College Student Union and was also made the Vice President of the Students&#x27; Federation of India. In 1972, at the early age of 23, he joined the State Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

==Political career==

Six years after being selected in the CPI (M) State Committee, Sarkar was included in the party state secretariat in the year 1978. This was also the year when the first Left Front government had taken control in Tripura.

In 1980, at the age of 31, he was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly from the Agartala constituency. This was the start of Manik Sarkar&#x27;s leadership in his state. At around the same time, he was appointed the Chief Whip of the CPI (M). His success as the Member of the Legislative Assembly returned in 1983, when he was elected to the Assembly from Krishnanagar, Agartala. When the Left Front government took control in 1993, Sarkar was appointed the State Secretary of the CPI (M).

The biggest success came to Sarkar in 1998. At the age of 49, he became a member of the Politburo of the CPI (M), which is the principal policy-making and executive committee in a Communist party. In the same year, he became the Chief Minister of the state of Tripura. Since then, he was elected to the same position four consecutive times in 20 years. He is one of the very few chief Ministers in India who was in the office for so long. His party lost majority in the 2018 elections and he had to step down as a result.

It was noted that Sarkar did not contest the 2023 elections. He revealed that he had done so in order to pave way for younger leadership.

==Personal life==
Sarkar is married to Panchali Bhattacharya, who was employed with the Central Social Welfare Board till she retired in 2011. He chooses to live in an old and a very small house that belonged to his great grandfather. He used to donate his entire salary that he received as a Chief Minister to his party and in return, got 5,000 per month as allowance.

<doc id="1298951" wikidata="Q24962674" url="?curid=1298951" title="Internalized oppression">
<text>In social justice theory, internalized oppression is the resignation by members of an oppressed group to the methods of an oppressing group and their incorporation of its message against their own best interest. Rosenwasser (2002) defines it as believing, adopting, accepting, and incorporating the negative beliefs provided by the oppressor as the truth.

It occurs as a part of socialization in an oppressive environment. Members of marginalized groups assimilate the oppressive view of their own group and consequently affirm negative self-stereotypes. This harms their psycho-social well-being and self-systems, causing them to produce and reproduce stress-induced, disadvantageous behavioral responses that lead to the development of maladaptive habits. As a result, they cultivate and perpetuate an &quot;assaulted sense of self&quot; by not intentionally and deliberately engaging in active responsibility for their own well-being. Furthermore, the absence of proactive engagement as catalysts for change, such as fostering counterspaces and practicing active citizenship, hinders the overall welfare of the collective in hegemonic societies.

Depending on the form of discrimination, types of internalized oppression include internalized racism, internalized homophobia, internalized sexism, internalized ableism and auto-antisemitism. A related psychological characteristic is &quot;internalized domination&quot;. It occurs as part of socialization that privileges oppressing groups. Members of oppressing groups accept their socially superior status as natural, sacrosanct, and faultless, and they believe that the privileges associated with their status are exclusive and truly justified.

==Types==
Internalized oppression occurs as a result of psychological injury caused by external oppressive events (e.g., harassment and discrimination), and it has a negative impact on individuals&#x27; self system (e.g., self-esteem, self-image, self-concept, self-worth, and self-regulation). The trauma of internalized oppression is intensified by repetitive exposure to explicit violence such as segregation and discrimination, as well as implicitly through various forms of oppressive microprocesses and insidious microaggressions (e.g., privation of inclusion and peripheralizing). It may manifest on an individual or group level, and may form as base for in-group conflict and further discrimination that can be hurtful and limiting. 

Internalized racism is about fostering a negative attitude towards one&#x27;s own race, created by the oppressing race, and nurturing a positive attitude towards the oppressor&#x27;s race (e.g., race traitor). As a result, it leads individuals to experience chronic self-hatred and deny their membership in their own racial group. Over time, it can be an effect of internalized colonialism. As heirs of ingrained assimilation to the oppressor&#x27;s truth and by nurturing attributional errors, the colonized people gradually accept the oppressor&#x27;s norm as the norm to follow, often unintentionally and without being aware of it. An example of internalized colonialism on self-perception is the practice of skin whitening (see colorism), which is found in Africa and Asia.

Internalized homophobia, also known as internalized heterosexism, occurs in the LGBT community when individuals adopt a culture&#x27;s heterosexist attitudes. It has a positive correlation with psychological distress and a negative correlation with self-esteem. Internalized homophobia is strongly associated with guilt and shame (especially among youth) and has been linked to increased anxiety, depression and suicide.

In internalized sexism, individuals (generally women) adopt oppressive attitudes towards their gender which are held by their culture. An example is slut-shaming, where women criticize transgressions of accepted codes of sexual conduct on themselves and other women.

Internalized ableism is often a result of relentless pathologization and lack of or inadequate support disabled people face on a daily basis. The fact the medical establishment is a significant factor that causes and contributes to interalized ableism with frameworks such as the pathology paradigm mean that disabled people trying to enact emancipatory change and self-identify are often deemed as &quot;anti-science&quot; by individuals and institutions which subscribe to scientism. 
Internalized oppression may also exist among immigrants, and based on the transgenerational trauma, it may affect their descendants as well. When the host community devalues a foreigner&#x27;s ethnic origin, native language or culture, the immigrant may feel inferior. Prolonged exposure to such devaluation can lead to the well-known inferiority complex among the oppressed. Immigrants who adapt to this environment, according to the psychology of oppression, may adopt the oppressor&#x27;s guidelines and prohibitions, assimilate their image and social behaviors, and become agents of their own and their community&#x27;s oppression. This is often characterized by self-hatred, which manifests itself in an exaggerated conformity to dominant norms. To cope, an immigrant may either assimilate and acculturate or develop a Nero complex.

==Causes==
Internalized oppression &quot;occurs when a person comes to internalize oppressive prejudices and biases about the identity group(s) to which he or she belongs&quot;. It occurs when &quot;[s]ocial oppression such as racism, sexism, ableism, classism, heterosexism, gender and religious oppression, and anti-Semitism&quot; are &quot;implanted by and [work] toward the benefit of any dominant group&quot;. Internalized oppression &quot;depends on limiting, blocking, and undermining&quot; the &quot;success, innovation, and power&quot; of oppressed individuals or groups. Some individuals will copy and internalize &quot;institutionalized rejection of difference,&quot; failing &quot;to examine the distortions which result from ... misnaming [these differences] and their effects on human behavior and expectations.&quot;

===Related theories===
French philosopher Michel Foucault &quot;has argued that the rise of parliamentary institutions and of new conceptions of political liberty was accompanied by a darker counter-movement, by the emergence of a new and unprecedented discipline directed against the body. More is required of the body now than mere political allegiance or the approbation of the products of its labor: the new discipline invades the body and seeks to regulate its very forces and operations, the economy and efficiency of its movements ... the production of &#x27;docile bodies&#x27; requires that an uninterrupted coercion be directed to the very processes of bodily activity, not just their result; this &#x27;micro-physics of power&#x27; fragments and partitions the body&#x27;s time, its space, and its movements&quot;.

The 18th-century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s Panopticon is a theoretical model of Foucault&#x27;s ideas. Its constant state of surveillance, imposed by an oppressive external force, serves to induce in the inmate a state of consciousness and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power&#x27;; each becomes to himself his own jailer&quot;.

==Effects==

&quot;If women are surrounded by people who view them as subordinate, incapable, or lacking control over their actions, women are likely to come to understand themselves in a similar way, even if subconsciously.&quot; Internalized oppression fosters the beliefs that the self cannot be autonomous, is unworthy of wielding power, and is little more than an object of sexual gratification (see sexual objectification). &quot;Psychological oppression can be damaging to a person&#x27;s moral relationship with the self ... Since those who have internalized oppressive prejudices often engage in behavior that further perpetuates these biases, internalized oppression is not only a symptom of an oppressive social climate, but it also represents a mechanism for its continued existence&quot;. According to University of Massachusetts Amherst doctoral students Valerie Joseph and Tanya O. Williams, &quot;Deep racial self-negation[,] ... internalized racial hatred [and] internalized oppression ... stymied [their] growth as people and scholars [and] inhibited [their] ability to be…profound, strong, and beautiful ...&quot; Individuals can be made to feel &quot;implicated in a project of compliance with the values and goals&quot; of the dominant society. Internalized oppression may also occur in disabled individuals, who may distance themselves from others with disabilities to avoid associating themselves with those who may be viewed by society as &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot;. Nabina Liebow wrote, &quot;People of color who internalize stereotypes regarding criminality and moral deviance ... can  ... view themselves as outlaws in the moral community&quot; and may &quot;engage in behavior that further perpetuates these biases ... Fulfilling these stereotypes further pushes someone outside the moral fold and intensifies one&#x27;s damaged moral identity ... [I]nternalizing stereotypes about criminality and moral deviance can lead to a pervasive feeling of guilt ... Persistent feelings of guilt can result in mental-health setbacks such as depression&quot; and &quot;repeated exposure to guilt and similar feelings has been linked with a range of health challenges such as &quot;dysfunctional coping, abdominal obesity, and glucose intolerance complicit in the development of Type 2 diabetes&quot;.

==Manifestations==
According to Audre Lorde, manifestations of internalized oppression include voluntary isolation. She describes the relationship between older members of an oppressed group and younger members of the same group as &quot;contemptible or suspect or excess.&quot; This generation gap leads to &quot;historical amnesia&quot;, with oppressed minorities repeating the learning process and failing to convey knowledge to subsequent generations. Lorde cites oppressed individuals as &quot;encouraged to pluck out some one aspect of [one]self and present this as the meaningful whole, eclipsing or denying the other parts of the self&quot;; they may hesitate to breach the false stereotypes surrounding them or verbalize resistance to violence. The most common manifestation is self-hatred.

Racial manifestations include &quot;multifaceted and extreme psychological, social, and economic self-sabotage&quot;; a tendency to &quot;defer to whites&quot;, and feelings of being &quot;not black enough&quot;. The self is viewed as a diminished, deviant, criminal and undeserving moral agent. Sandra Bartky identified disturbances in body image, gender expression and power dynamics as manifestations of internalized sexism in women.

==Remedies==
According to Audre Lorde, &quot;[T]he master&#x27;s tools will never dismantle the master&#x27;s house ... My fullest concentration of energy is available to me only when I integrate all the parts of who I am, openly, allowing power from the particular sources of my living to flow back and forth freely through all my different selves, without the restrictions of externally imposed definition&quot;. &quot;To root out internalized patterns of oppression&quot; women must &quot;recognize differences among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each other&#x27;s difference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles …to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference ... sharpen[ing] self-definition by exposing the self in work and struggle together with those whom we define as different from ourselves, although sharing similar goals&quot;.

To understand and overcome internalized oppression, Joseph and Williams developed a workshop to &quot;introduce and discuss issues of socialization, stereotyping, internalized oppression, and domination.&quot; This &quot;social justice education model ... encouraged an agent/target model of leadership&quot; in which representatives of the oppressor and oppressed classes joined together to guide &quot;participants in developing a plan of action to address racism.&quot; They recommended that fear &quot;left over about discussing race, racism, and internalized racism&quot; be set aside to &quot;talk forthrightly, honestly, reflectively, and thoughtfully about race&quot;, and the &quot;need to voice ... hurt, the need to surface realities, the need to shine light on a history that was and continues to be ignored&quot; is greater than the fear of discussing the issues. The internally oppressed must learn how they have been indoctrinated, to &quot;engage in a process of rejecting internalized subordination as an everyday choice&quot;.

<doc id="1298957" wikidata="Q893187" url="?curid=1298957" title="Boatswain's call">
<text>A boatswain&#x27;s call, pipe, or bosun&#x27;s whistle is a pipe or a non-diaphragm type whistle used on naval ships by a boatswain.

The pipe consists of a narrow tube (the gun) which directs air over a metal sphere (the buoy) with a hole in the top. The player opens and closes the hand over the hole to change the pitch. The rest of the pipe consists of a &quot;keel&quot;, a flat piece of metal beneath the gun that holds the call together, and the &quot;shackle&quot;, a keyring that connects a long silver or brass chain that sits around the collar, when in ceremonial uniform. 

==History and usage==
Historically the boatswain&#x27;s call was used to pass commands to the crew when the voice could not be heard over the sounds of the sea. Because of its high pitch, it could be heard over the activities of the crew and bad weather. It is now used in traditional bugle calls such as &quot;Evening Colors&quot;/&quot;Sunset&quot;, and in other ceremonies in most modern navies. It is sometimes accompanied by other auditive features such as ruffles and flourishes, voice commands and announcements, or even a gun salute.

It was first used as a badge of rank for the Lord High Admiral of England in 1485.

==Honouring==

*Pipe Aboard/Ashore: Flag-rank officers or an important guest is boarding or departing a Navy ship; also used to mark the final departure of a sailor retiring from active duty. This is part of a ceremony called &quot;manning the side&quot; which includes a party of sailors known as &quot;side boys&quot;. It has its origins in the need to hoist visiting senior officers aboard using a bosun&#x27;s chair when the weather was too rough for the use of ladders. The bosun would use his call to direct the side boys in the hoisting of the chair.
*Funerals: When the body of a person entitled to honours in their lifetime is taken aboard a Navy ship, the same ceremony is observed.

==Commands==

The following are the commands that are passed with the help of a bosun&#x27;s pipe.
*Haul: The most basic of calls. Crews of warships were not allowed to sing work songs or shanties, so the pipe coordinated the sailors. The low note was for the pause and preparatory; the high for pulling on the line.
*The Side or Away Galley: Descends from the tradition of hoisting officers aboard ship in a chair. It is a combination of &quot;haul&quot;, and then a command to lower. This call remains in use as an honour given to officers when embarking or disembarking.
*Away Boats: Used to order a ship&#x27;s boats to leave the ship&#x27;s side.
*Call the Boatswain&#x27;s Mates: The boatswain&#x27;s gang to report.
*All Hands on Deck: Crews were split into three (or earlier, two) rotating watches that stood for two to four hours at a time. This call signals the entire crew to assemble on deck.
*Word to be Passed: Command for silence, an order to follow.
*Pipe Down: Dismissal of all the crew not on watch.
*Sweepers: End of the work day. Ostensibly sailors would &quot;sweep up&quot; prior to departure in preparation for the following day.
*Pipe to any meal: Pipe All Hands, followed by long Heave Around (Mess gear), and long Pipe Down.
*Still: Used to call the crew to attention. This would be done, for example, when two warships meet, the still being piped as the junior ship salutes the senior ship (the seniority of a warship is the seniority of her captain); a less common alternative to the still being piped is a bugle call.
*Carry On: Used after the &quot;still&quot;, to dismiss the crew back to their duties.
*General Call: Piped before an announcement.
*Officer of the Day: Call the Officer of the Day to the Gangway.

<text>The mineral asbestos is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations that relate to its production and use, including mining, manufacturing, use and disposal. Injuries attributed to asbestos have resulted in both workers&#x27; compensation claims and injury litigation. Health problems attributed to asbestos include asbestosis, mesothelioma, lung cancer, and diffuse pleural thickening.

One of the major issues relating to asbestos in civil proceedings is the latency of asbestos-related diseases. Most countries have limitation periods to bar actions that are taken long after the cause of action has lapsed. For example, in Malaysia the time period to file a tort action is six years from the time the tort occurred. Due to several asbestos-related actions, countries such as Australia have amended their laws relating to limitations to accumulate starting from time of discovery rather than time when the cause of action accrued. The first employee claims for injury from exposure to asbestos in the workplace were made in 1927, and the first lawsuit against an asbestos manufacturer was filed in 1929. Since then, many lawsuits have been filed. As a result of the litigation, manufacturers sold off subsidiaries, diversified, produced asbestos substitutes, and started asbestos removal businesses.

Worldwide, 67 countries and territories (including those in the European Union) have banned the use of asbestos. It is listed as a category of controlled waste under Annex I of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal [1992]. This means that parties to the convention are required to prohibit the export of hazardous wastes to parties which have prohibited the import of such wastes via the notification procedure in Article 13 of the convention. In places such as India, however, there continues to be a high use of friable or dust-based asbestos in compressed asbestos fiber (CAF) gaskets, ropes, cloth, gland packings, millboards, insulation, brake liners, and other products which are being exported without adequate knowledge and information to the other countries. Asbestos use is prevalent in India because there is no effective enforcement of the rules.

==Background==
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, asbestos was considered an ideal material for use in the construction industry. It was known to be an excellent fire retardant, to have high electrical resistance, and was inexpensive and easy to use.

The dangers related to asbestos arise mainly when the fibers become airborne and are inhaled. Because of the size of the fibers, the lungs cannot expel them. These fibers are also sharp and penetrate internal tissues.

Health problems attributed to asbestos include:

#Asbestosis - A lung disease first found in textile workers, asbestosis is a scarring of the lung tissue resulting from the production of growth factors that stimulate fibroblasts (the scar-producing lung cells) to proliferate and synthesize the scar tissue in response to injury by the inhaled fibers. The scarring may eventually become so severe that the lungs can no longer function. The latency period (meaning the time it takes for the disease to develop) is often 10–20 years.
#Mesothelioma - A cancer of the mesothelial lining of the lungs and the chest cavity, the peritoneum (abdominal cavity) or the pericardium (a sac surrounding the heart). Unlike lung cancer, mesothelioma has no association with smoking. The only established causal factor is exposure to asbestos or similar fibers. The latency period for mesothelioma may be 20–50 years. The prognosis for mesothelioma is grim, with most patients dying within 12 months of diagnosis.
#Cancer - Cancer of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and larynx have been linked to asbestos. The latency period for cancer is often 15–30 years.
#Diffuse pleural thickening

Considerable international controversy exists regarding the perceived rights and wrongs associated with litigation on compensation claims related to asbestos exposure and alleged subsequent medical consequences. Some measure of the vast range of views expressed in legal and political circles can perhaps be exemplified by the two quotes below, the first from Prof. Lester Brickman, an American legal ethicist writing in the &quot;Pepperdine Law Review&quot;, and second, Michael Wills, a British Member of Parliament, speaking in the House of Commons on July 13. 2006:

&quot;A review of the scholarly literature indicates a substantial degree of indifference to the causes of this civil justice system failure. Many of the published articles on asbestos litigation focus on transactional costs and ways in which the flow of money from defendants to plaintiffs and their lawyers can be expeditiously and efficiently prioritized and routed. The failure to acknowledge, let alone analyze, the overriding reality of specious claiming and meritless claims demonstrates a disconnect between the scholarship and the reality of the litigation that is nearly as wide as the disconnect between rates of disease claiming and actual disease manifestation&quot;.

&quot;Many of those who I see in my surgeries have worked in a number of workplaces and they could have been exposed to asbestos in each of them, but medical science is such that no one can identify which of them it is. As a result, there has been a long and complex history of legal discussion on how to apportion liability. The lawyers and the judiciary have wrestled, rightly and valiantly, with complex and difficult law, but it has created despair for the families whom we represent. Many of my constituents&#x27; families have been riven by the consequences of litigation in trying to get some compensation for a disease that has been contracted through no fault of theirs. That is cruel and unacceptable.&quot;

==Regulation==
===Complete bans on asbestos===
Worldwide, 68 countries and territories (including those in the European Union) have banned the use of asbestos. Exemptions for minor uses are permitted in some countries listed; however, all countries listed must have banned the use of all types of asbestos.

===International law===
Asbestos is listed as a category of controlled waste under Annex I of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal [1992]. Specifically, any waste streams having asbestos (dust and fibers) as constituents are controlled (Item Y36). In general terms, Parties to the convention are required to prohibit and not permit the export of hazardous wastes to the Parties which have prohibited the import of such wastes via the notification procedure in Article 13 of the convention.

===Australia===
A nationwide ban on importing and using all forms asbestos took effect on 31 December 2003. Reflecting the ban, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) revised asbestos-related material to promote a consistent approach to controlling exposure to workplace asbestos and to introduce best-practice health and safety measures for asbestos management, control and removal. The ban does not cover asbestos materials or products already in use at the time the ban was implemented.

Although Australia has only a third of the UK&#x27;s population, its asbestos disease fatalities approximate Britain&#x27;s of more than 3,000 people per year.

Western Australia&#x27; center of blue asbestos mining was Wittenoom. The mine was run by CSR Limited (a company that had been the Colonial Sugar Refinery). The main manufacturer of asbestos products was James Hardie, which set up a minor fund for its workers, then transferred operations to the Netherlands where it would be out of reach of the workers when the fund expired.

===Brazil===
The São Paulo State law 12.684/07 prohibits the use of any product which utilizes asbestos. This legislation has been formally upheld by the Brazilian Supremo Tribunal Federal.

===Canada===
Since the 1980s, Canada has not permitted crocidolite asbestos to be used and has had limitations on certain uses of other types of asbestos, notably in some construction materials and textiles.

In late 2011, Canada&#x27;s remaining two asbestos mines, both located in the Province of Quebec, halted operations. The following year, Quebec&#x27;s government announced a halt to asbestos mining and the federal government announced that it would end its opposition to adding chrysotile asbestos to the list of hazardous substances under the international Rotterdam Convention.

In 2018, the Canadian federal government posted proposed regulations planned for implementation later that year, which would prohibit use, sale, import, and export of all forms of asbestos. Since 30 December 2018, the import, sale, and use of raw asbestos have been formally prohibited, and products containing asbestos are also banned except for certain specialized uses, such as in nuclear facilities.

===France===
France banned the use of asbestos in 1997, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld France&#x27;s right to the ban in 2000. In addition, France has called for a worldwide ban.

===Hong Kong===
The import, shipment, supply of, and use of all forms of asbestos is banned in Hong Kong under the Air Pollution Control Ordinance (Cap. 311).

Before the 1980s, use of the material was common in construction, manufacturing, and shipping. The government banned the use of most asbestos products in public areas in 1978. The Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Asbestos) Special Regulation (Cap. 59X), which came into force in 1986, and the subsequent Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Asbestos) Regulation (Cap. 59AD) implemented controls on the use of asbestos in the workplace and banned the use of amphibole asbestos completely.

The import of amosite or crocidolite to Hong Kong was banned in 1996 by the Air Pollution Control Ordinance (Cap. 311). On 4 April 2014, the Air Pollution Control (Amendment) Ordinance 2014 came into force, completely banning the import, transshipment, supply and installation of all forms of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials in Hong Kong by amending the existing Air Pollution Control Ordinance. Buildings built before the mid 1980s may continue the use of asbestos-containing materials.

===India===

The Vision Statement on Environment and Human Health of the Government of India states &quot;&quot;Alternatives to asbestos may be used to the extent possible and use of asbestos may be phased out.&quot;

In Case No.693/30/97-98, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has clearly directed to &quot;Replace all asbestos sheets roofing with roofing made up of some other material that would not be harmful to inmates&quot;.&quot;

The Secretary of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education &amp; Research (PGIMER, Chandigarh also voiced its opinion &quot;&quot;Asbestos is definitely a harmful material, it causes cancer and other related diseases&quot;.&quot; In their complete statement and recommendation to NHRC they have clearly expressed their concern: &quot;&quot;White asbestos (chrysotile asbestos) is implicated in so many studies with the following diseases: Mesothelioma (cancer of pleura), Lung Cancer, Peritoneal Cancer, Asbestosis, and is also considered as a cause for Ovarian Cancer, Laryngeal Cancer, Other Cancererous Diseases are produced in the person involved in Asbestos Industry&quot;.&quot; It concludes its position by specifying, &quot;&quot;Hence, Use of White Asbestos should be completely banned in India and the same may be replaced by some safer alternative material&quot;.&quot;

The Joint Secretary, Government of Uttarakhand in Case No.2951/30/0/2011, submitted to the NHRC that &quot;There is no cure for Asbestos Diseases. Stopping all exposure to Asbestos is only essential.&quot;

The Union Ministry of Labour&#x27;s concept paper declared, &quot;The Government of India is considering the ban on use of chrysotile asbestos in India to protect the workers and the general population against primary and secondary exposure to Chrysotile form of Asbestos.&quot; The Concept paper further notes, &quot;&quot;Asbestosis is yet another occupational disease of the Lungs which is on an increase under similar circumstances warranting concentrated efforts of all stake holders to evolve strategies to curb this menace&quot;.

The Indian Factory Act and Bureau of Indian Standard already have rules and regulations for safe usage of asbestos contaminated products such as:
* IS 11769 Part 1: Guidelines for Safe Usage of Asbestos Cement Products like Asbestos Cement Sheets and Asbestos Cement Blocks.
* IS 11769 Part 2: Guidelines for Safe Usage of Asbestos Friction Products like Asbestos Friction Sheets and Brake Liners
* IS 11769 Part 3: Guidelines for Safe Usage of Asbestos Sealing and Insulation Products like CAF Gaskets, Gland Ropes, Insulation, Rope Lagging, Millboard
* IS 12081: Pictorial Warning to be implemented on equipment containing Asbestos Contaminated Products.
* IS 11451: Safety and Health Requirements related to Occupational Exposure to Asbestos contaminated Products.
* IS 11768: Waste Disposal Procedure for Asbestos Containing Products.

However, there is no enforcement of the rules at ground level, hence asbestos usage is prevalent without following even the simplest basic safety rules.

The Centre for Pollution Control Board struggles to enforce their own guidelines for asbestos as hazardous waste and relies on industries and companies to volunteer themselves to follow Safety Regulations.
There continues to be a high usage of friable or dust based asbestos in compressed asbestos fiber (CAF) gaskets, ropes, cloth, gland packings, millboards, insulation and brake liners in factories and industries within India as well as inadvertently exported by equipment manufacturers without adequate knowledge and information to the other countries.

On 21 January 2011, the Supreme Court of India reiterated the guidelines laid down by it in the 1995 judgement regarding asbestos.

In spite of the health hazards, asbestos is widely used in India without any restriction. Activists in India and abroad have tried to persuade the governments of Canada and Quebec to stop asbestos mining in Quebec and exporting to India. The Canadian government has repeatedly blocked asbestos being listed as a hazardous chemical by the UN even though it spends massive amounts of money to remove it from Canadian homes and offices. While India recognizes it as a hazardous substance and has banned asbestos mining and its waste trade, it keeps its price low through patronage.

On 15 August 2016, in the strongest statement till date, the Anil Madhav Dave, Union Minister of Environment, Forest &amp; Climate Change categorically specified &quot;Since the use of asbestos is affecting human health, its usage should gradually be minimised and ended. As far as I know, its use is declining, but it must end&quot;&quot; 

The Ban Asbestos Network of India (BANI) has been working towards an asbestos free India to safeguard the health of the present and future generations amidst the misinformation campaign of the White Chrysotile Industry.

On 5 May 2017, India opposed listing of asbestos under the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) list of hazardous substances during the 2017 United Nations Rotterdam Convention. As such, India is the second democracy (after Russia) to have such a stance, globally. Besides India, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Syria, and Zimbabwe also opposed the listing. While, all the other countries opposing are producers of asbestos; India (&quot;where mining is banned&quot;) is the sole (&quot;and largest&quot;) consumer and importer of asbestos still opposing its inclusion on the PIC List.

The National Asbestos Profile of India made in cooperation by Peoples Training and Research Centre, Vadodara, Occupational &amp; Environmental Health Network of India, New Delhi and Asia Monitor Resource Centre, Hong Kong is the first such attempt and resource for identifying total asbestos usage in India. This extensive profile documents the manufacturers, consumers, health and disease statistics of asbestos use in India.

===Italy===
Italy fully banned the use of asbestos in 1992 with law 257/92 art. 1 and set up a comprehensive plan for asbestos decontamination in industry and housing.

===Japan===
Japan did not fully ban asbestos until 2004. Its government has been held responsible for related diseases.

=== Philippines===
The Philippines has a limited ban on asbestos. While the use of amphibole asbestos is banned as early as 2000 through Administrative
Order for the Chemical Control Order of Asbestos issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, chrysotile asbestos is allowed for use in specific high density products.

=== Poland ===
Poland fully banned asbestos in 1997. Since then the import of asbestos and products containing it, production of anything containing asbestos and circulation of asbestos and products which have it is prohibited.

===South Africa===
Asbestos was banned in South Africa in 2008. Prior to this, the country was one of the global leaders in asbestos production, and consequently had one of the highest rates of mesothelioma. Regulations to ban asbestos in South Africa occurred in March 2008 under the leadership of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk. The first draft regulations were announced in November 2005 for public comment and again in September 2007. The regulations prohibited the use, processing, manufacturing, and import and export of any asbestos or asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). A grace period of 120 days was allowed to give people or traders currently dealing in asbestos or ACMs to clear their stock. Exemptions would be granted under strict control. The regulations did not prohibit the continued use of asbestos-containing materials that were already in place such as asbestos-cement roof sheets or ceilings, the department was satisfied that there was &quot;no undue risk&quot; and they would be replaced in due time. Penalties for the continued use of asbestos include a fine which would not exceed R100 000 and/or imprisonment of less than ten years. Prior to the regulations&#x27; implementation, asbestos had been in the process of being phased out from as early as 2003. Requests from Zimbabwe and Canada to be excepted from the prohibition were denied. South Africa also terminated all import of asbestos or ACMs from Zimbabwe. South Africa would allow products to pass through its borders while in transit under strict conditions and if registered with the department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. Everite, a building company, supported the government&#x27;s ban on imports from Zimbabwe It became an offence to acquire, process, package or repackage, manufacture or distribute these products from after July 28, 2008. Kgalagadi Relief Trust (KRT) chair Brian Gibson stated that asbestos may still be imported into South Africa for research or analysis. Asbestos may also be imported into the country for disposal from Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries that were unable to dispose of the waste themselves.

===South Korea===
In May 1997, the manufacture and use of crocidolite and amosite, commonly known as blue and brown asbestos, were fully banned in South Korea. In January 2009, a full-fledged ban on all types of asbestos occurred when the government banned the manufacture, import, sale, storage, transport or use of asbestos or any substance containing more than 0.1% of asbestos. In 2011, South Korea became the world&#x27;s sixth country to enact an asbestos harm aid act, which entitles any Korean citizen to free lifetime medical care as well as monthly income from the government if they are diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease.

===New Zealand===
In 1984, the import of raw amphibole (blue and brown) asbestos into New Zealand was banned. In 2002, the import of chrysotile (white) asbestos was banned.

===United Kingdom===
The British Government&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has promoted rigorous controls on asbestos handling, based on reports linking exposure to asbestos dust or fibres with thousands of annual deaths from mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung cancer.
*&quot;Over 5,000 asbestos-related disease deaths per year currently (2022)&quot;
* The TUC (UK) cited a figure of 5,000 deaths per year in 2004.

The HSE does not assume that there is any minimum threshold for exposure to asbestos below which a person is at zero risk of developing mesothelioma, since they consider that it cannot currently be quantified for practical purposes; they cite evidence from epidemiological studies of asbestos-exposed groups to argue that even if there is any such threshold for mesothelioma, it must be at a very low level.
Previously it was possible to claim compensation for pleural plaques caused by negligent exposure to asbestos, on the grounds that although it is in itself asymptomatic, it is linked to development of diffuse pleural thickening, which causes lung impairment. It has been highly contentious, however, as to the probability of pleural plaques developing into pleural thickening or other asbestos-related illnesses. On October 17, 2007, this point was clarified by the Law Lords&#x27; ruling that workers who have pleural plaques as a result of asbestos exposure will no longer be able to seek compensation as it does not in itself constitute a disease. This ruling was, however, superseded, so far as sufferers of pleural plaques in Scotland are concerned, by the passing of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)(Scotland) Act 2009, which provides that in Scots law pleural plaques are to be considered an actionable type of personal injury.
====Control of Asbestos Regulations====
The Control of Asbestos Regulations were introduced in the UK in November 2006 and were an amalgamation of three previous sets of legislation (Asbestos Prohibition, Asbestos Licensing and the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations) aimed at minimising the use and disturbance of asbestos containing materials within British workplaces. Essentially this legislation bans the import and use of most asbestos products and sets out guidelines on how best to manage those currently in situ.

The Control of Asbestos Regulations were amended and the revised regulations came into force on 6 April 2012 to take account of the European Commission&#x27;s view that the UK had not fully implemented the EU Directive on exposure to asbestos (Directive 2009/148/EC). These changes were relatively minor and included additional requirements for non-licensed asbestos work. These changes mean that some non-licensed asbestos work now requires notification, and has additional requirements for managing this work (e.g. record keeping and health surveillance).

Dutyholders of all non-domestic properties within the UK must establish an asbestos register and a management plan. The definition of &quot;non-domestic&quot; is &quot;a property or structure (commercial, domestic or residential) where work is carried out&quot; and the obligation of a &quot;dutyholder&quot; is to ensure that people are not exposed to any asbestos-based materials during the course of their work. The Asbestos Register states the presence or non-presence of asbestos related to the inside and outside of the structure. The exception is where the property age (post-1999 when chrysotile asbestos was banned) would indicate that such products will not have been used during the construction of the building.

Regulation 4 prescribes that each non-domestic building&#x27;s &quot;dutyholder&quot;, as defined in law, has a duty to manage the risk from asbestos and mandates that &quot;a suitable and sufficient assessment is carried out&quot;. Risk assessment involves a combination of factors relating to the type and condition of the asbestos-containing materials and the likelihood of disturbance and exposure. Human exposure potential depends on the number of occupants in a building and the frequency and duration of use, and the nature of any disturbance: for example, intrusive maintenance activity within the building increases the risk of exposure - removing a number of asbestos-containing ceiling tiles to undertake works above the ceiling level would raise greater risks than changing a light bulb. Buildings may be ranked according to whether disturbance activity is undertaken:

*rare disturbance activity, e.g. a little-used store room
*low disturbance activity, e.g. office work
*periodic disturbance activity, e.g. industrial use or vehicular movement
*high disturbance activity, e.g. a fire door containing asbestos-insulating boards which is in constant use

The HSE uses a priority scoring tool which combines assessment of the material containing asbestos and the disturbance risk.

The outcome of the risk assessment will identify priorities for management of the locations and materials containing asbestos, for example areas which require urgent attention, materials which are not suited to any form of containment may need to be removed or encased, minor repairs may be needed, or labelling and provision of information may be sufficient to ensure that significant health risks can be avoided, e.g. for a little-used store room it may be sufficient to keep the door locked and attach a warning notice to the door.

The HSE points out that &quot;Regulation 4 is a duty to manage, not [just] a duty to survey&quot;.

The removal of high-risk asbestos products from non-domestic properties is tightly controlled by the HSE and high-risk products such as thermal insulation must be removed under controlled conditions by licensed contractors. Further guidance on which products this applies to can be found on the HSE website along with a list of licensees.

The current regulations show that it is a legal requirement that all who may come across asbestos in their day-to-day work have been provided with the relevant asbestos training.

====Bans====
The manufacture and import of Blue and Brown Asbestos were banned in the United Kingdom in 1985 by The asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations 1985. The use of White Asbestos was banned in England, Scotland and Wales in 1999 by The Asbestos (Prohibitions) (Amendment) Regulations 1999. Asbestos was banned in Northern Ireland in 2000 by the Asbestos (Prohibitions) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000.

===United States===

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has no general ban on the use of asbestos. However, asbestos was one of the first hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act of 1970, and many applications have been forbidden by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The United States has extensive laws regulating the use of asbestos at the federal, state, and local level.

==Litigation==
One of the major issues relating to asbestos in civil procedure is the latency of asbestos-related diseases. Most countries have limitation periods to bar actions that are taken long after the cause of action has lapsed. For example, in Malaysia the time period to file a tort action is six years from the time the tort occurred. Due to several asbestos-related actions, countries such as Australia have amended their laws relating to limitations to accumulate starting from time of discovery rather than time when the cause of action accrued.

The first employee claims for injury from exposure to asbestos in the workplace were made in 1927, and the first lawsuit against an asbestos manufacturer was filed in 1929. Since then, many lawsuits have been filed. As a result of the litigation, manufacturers sold off subsidiaries, diversified, produced asbestos substitutes, and started asbestos removal businesses.

===Brazil===
In June 2008, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted to maintain the law (12.684/07) which prohibits the use of any product which utilizes asbestos in São Paulo State. It was expected then the decision would be extended to include the whole country.

In August 2017, in what is known in Brazil as a &quot;direct action for the declaration of unconstitutionality&quot;, an instrument to declare the unconstitutionality of law or federal norms, with respect to the current Constitution (the equivalent in the U.S. as a &quot;judicial review&quot;), the constitutionality of the prohibitive law of São Paulo was questioned. The Supreme Federal Court considered it constitutional and even incidentally declared the unconstitutionality of Art. 2 of Federal Law nº 9.055/95, that authorized the use of chrysotile asbestos in a controlled manner.

On November 29, 2017, the Supreme Federal Court prohibited the extraction, industrialization and commercialization of asbestos throughout the country. Despite this, asbestos has continued to be extracted in Goiás under claims that the state&#x27;s asbestos is &quot;the only one recognized worldwide as not causing any ill effects to the population&quot;. As of January 2025, the Supreme Federal Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the state law that allows for the extraction.

===South Africa===
The Lubbe v Cape Plc case [2000] UKHL 41 is a conflict of laws case, which is also significant for the question of &quot;lifting the corporate veil&quot; in relation to tort victims. Mrs Lubbe was exposed to asbestos while working for a South African subsidiary company of the UK parent company, Cape plc.

The Richard Meeran-run Cape Plc case was settled in 2003.

The Richard Spoor-run Gencor case was settled in 2003.

400 Swaziland ARD victims from the Havelock mine

The Havelock chrysotile mine cases were suspended in 2003 because Turner and Newall, the company that owned the mine, had filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
Swiss Eternit Group

This was a voluntary agreement which was reached in 2006. The agreement enabled ex-miners of the Kuruman and Danielskuil Cape Blue Asbestos (KCBA and DCBA) mines in the Northern Cape province to apply under similar conditions as the open settlement of the ART. The Kgalagadi Relief Trust (KRT) was
thus created. The terms of the trust are not clarified however in practice R136 million was paid over for compensation purposes, for payouts until 2026. The trustees of the KRT requested the ART to administer the KRT settlement as the two trusts were very similarly structured.

Seventy-five percent of the claimants in the Cape Plc case came from Limpopo province and the remaining twenty-five percent from the Prieska Koegas area in the Northern Cape province. The majority of the claimants in the ART settlement (around 78%) were exposed in the Kuruman area in the Northern Cape province, with the balance exposed at Penge in Limpopo province and Msauli in Mpumalanga province, which were equally proportioned.

Statistically, mesothelioma and asbestos related lung cancer sufferers receiving the highest payments of R71,500 each. 
Due to Gencor&#x27;s significant contribution settlements, it was prohibited for those who had received compensation under the Cape agreement to later be paid by the ART, even if the worker had worked on the Kuruman or Penge mines when under Gencor control.

====Relief trusts====
In 2006, Cape plc started a trust to compensate those who have suffered from asbestos related diseases as a result of Cape&#x27;s historical activities. To date, this Trust has paid out over £30m to those who have become sick or to their dependents. The Scheme of Arrangement was approved by the High Court and is separately funded. Its funds being administered by two independent trustees.

Asbestos Relief Trust (ART) is regarded as a model of efficient occupational disease compensation in South Africa. Gencor was a major contributor to the Richard Meeran-run Cape Plc case and the Richard Spoor-run Gencor case. Glencor provided 29% of the R138 million that went to the Cape Plc&#x27;s set of claimants, and 96% of the R381 million that formed the ART. An additional sum of R35 million went to environmental rehabilitation, and about R20 million was added to the ART to contribute to supplementary and additional payments. After some time and publicity claims against The Cape Plc list had grown from 2 000 in January 1999 and to 7 500 in August 2001. The ART settlement was open, and made provision for compensation to any person who met the compensation criteria set out in the Trust deed, until the year 2028. Many companies agreed to compensate the workers which were exposed to asbestos in addition to the compensation payable under the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act (ODMWA) The settlement included environmentally expose victims of ARDS. This settlement model was achieved by personal communication, Georgina Jephson, attorney at Richard Spoor Inc. Attorneys.

The Trust provides compensation for people in these four categories related to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) namely:

*(ARD1)- asbestosis / pleural thickening with mild to moderate
*(ARD2) -lung function impairment or with severe lung function impairment
*(ARD3) -asbestos-related lung cancer
*(ARD4) -mesothelioma

A model by the ART estimated that about 16 800 individuals would submit claims to the Trust, of which approximately 5 036 (30%) would be successful. This was subsequently revised to 5 162. Of these, 219 (4.2%) would be environmental claimants, 150 (2.9%) would have lung cancer and 556 (10.8%) would have mesothelioma; the balance would have asbestosis and/or pleural thickening. No definitive figures were provided for the expected ARD1/
ARD2 ratio. The amounts payable for compensation vary, but the average amount of compensation since 2003 has been about R40 000, R80 000, R170 000 and R350 000 for each of the categories ARD 1-4 described above. These amounts are paid over and above any compensation that the claimants might receive under the ODMWA. In order for a case to be compensable, a victim needs to show that he/she was both exposed to asbestos from one of the operations run by the funders of the ART, and has a compensable disease.

====Health====
A lack of facilities for terminally ill mesothelioma sufferers results in a larger burden of service, according to Sister Phemelo Magabanyane, a palliative care nurse who has cared for over 100 mesothelioma and lung cancer sufferers in the greater Kuruman district in the Northern Cape. Mesothelioma is a life-threatening cancer of the pleura or peritoneum which can be diagnosed up to 40 years after exposure to asbestos.
====The aftermath====
South Africa has the highest prevalence of mesothelioma in the world. Richard Spoor, a lawyer who represented the claimants against Gencor says: &quot;The environmental scale of the disaster we are seeing unfold in the Northern Cape is on a level with the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, in terms of impact, spread and longevity,&quot; he also says that children are particularly vulnerable to mesothelioma. Since September 2016, five of the 1 600 claimants he represents in the Northern Cape have died. Internationally renowned photographer David Goldblatt started photographing victims after a friend died of mesothelioma despite never being in close proximity to a mine. It has been reported that she picked up the disease from rubbing a blue asbestos rock ornament that she kept in her home.

===United Kingdom===
Guardian Unlimited reported a test-case ruling in 2005, that allowed thousands of workers to be compensated for pleural plaques. Diffuse or localised fibrosis of the pleura, or pleural plaques, is less serious than asbestosis or mesothelioma, but is also considered a disease closely linked to the inhalation of asbestos. However, insurers claimed the plaques are &quot;simply a marker for asbestos exposure rather than an injury.&quot; Mr Justice Holland rejected the insurers&#x27; arguments, and counsel for workers hailed the decision as a &quot;victory that puts people before profits.&quot; However this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. On 17 October 2007, the House of Lords confirmed the Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision. Pleural plaques no longer constitute actionable injury in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish government introduced legislation in 2009 to preserve the status of pleural plaques as an actionable injury in Scotland and there are proposals to introduce similar legislation in Northern Ireland.

Insurance companies allege that asbestos litigation has taken too heavy a toll on insurance and industry. A 2002 article in the British &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s associate quoted Equitas, the reinsurance vehicle which assumed Lloyd&#x27;s of London&#x27;s liabilities, which argued that asbestos claims were the &quot;greatest single threat&quot; to Lloyd&#x27;s of London&#x27;s existence. Of note is that Lloyd&#x27;s of London had been sued for fraud by its investors, who claimed Lloyd&#x27;s misrepresented pending losses from asbestos claims.

In May 2006, the House of Lords ruled that compensation for asbestos injuries should be reduced where responsibility could not be attached to a single employer. Critics, including trade unions, asbestos groups and Jim Wallace, former justice minister, have condemned the ruling. They said it overturned the traditional Scottish law to such cases, and was a breach of natural justice. As a result of this outcry, the ruling has been overturned by section three of the Compensation Act 2006.

In February 2010 a court ruling set a new precedent for asbestosis claims. The case, in which widow Della Sabin attempted to claim compensation following her husband&#x27;s death from asbestosis, hinged on the issue of how many asbestos fibers must be present in the lungs for a claim to be valid. A research team based at Llandough Hospital initially reported that the minimum amount of fibers that needed to be present for a claim to be valid was 20 million (only 7 million were found in the sample taken from Mrs Sabin&#x27;s husband Leslie). However, a subsequent US study suggested that, due to the fact that Leslie had lived for more than forty years after his exposure, a large number of fibers would have cleared from his body naturally; had he died twenty years earlier the asbestos count in his lungs would have been about 35 million fibers per gram. The judge preferred this evidence, and ruled in favor of Mrs Sabin.

===United States===

====Civil lawsuits====
Litigation related to asbestos injuries and property damages has been claimed to be the longest-running mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 8,000 defendants and 700,000 claimants. Since asbestos-related disease has been identified by the medical profession in the late 1920s, workers&#x27; compensation cases were filed and resolved in secrecy, with a flood of litigation starting in the United States in the 1970s, and culminating in the 1980s and 1990s. Current trends indicate that the rate at which people are diagnosed with asbsestos-related disease will likely increase through the next decade. Analysts have estimated that the total costs of asbestos litigation in the USA alone will eventually reach $200 to $275 billion. The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.
A multi-district litigation (MDL) complex filing has remained pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for over 20 years. As many of the scarring-related injury cases have been resolved, asbestos litigation continues to be hard-fought among the litigants, mainly in individually brought cases for terminal cases of asbestosis, mesothelioma, and other cancers.

In June 1982, a retired boilermaker, James Cavett, won an award of $2.3 million compensatory and $1.5 million in punitive damages against Johns-Manville. The Manville Corporation, formerly the Johns-Manville Corporation, filed for reorganization and protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code in August 1982. At the time, it was the largest company ever to file bankruptcy, and was one of the richest. Manville was then 181st on the Fortune 500, but was the defendant of 16,500 lawsuits related to the health effects of asbestos. The company was described by Ron Motley, a South Carolina attorney, as &quot;the greatest corporate mass murderer in history.&quot; Court documents show that the corporation had a long history of hiding evidence of the ill effects of asbestos from its workers and the public.

By the early 1990s, &quot;more than half of the 25 largest asbestos manufacturers in the US, including Amatex, Carey-Canada, Celotex, Eagle-Picher, Forty-Eight Insulations, Manville Corporation, National Gypsum, Standard Insulation, Unarco, and UNR Industries had declared bankruptcy. Filing for bankruptcy protects a company from its creditors.&quot;

Asbestos-related cases increased on the U.S. Supreme Court docket after 1980 and the court has dealt with several asbestos-related cases since 1986. Two large class action settlements, designed to limit liability, came before the court in 1997 and 1999. Both settlements were ultimately rejected by the court because they would exclude future claimants, or those who later developed asbestos-related illnesses. These rulings addressed the 20-50 year latency period of serious asbestos-related illnesses.

In 1988, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued regulations requiring certain U.S. companies to report the asbestos used in their products.

Several legislative remedies have been considered by the U.S. Congress but each time rejected for a variety of reasons. In 2005, Congress considered but did not pass legislation entitled the &quot;Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005&quot;. The act would have established a $140 billion trust fund in lieu of litigation, but as it would have proactively taken funds held in reserve by bankruptcy trusts, manufacturers and insurance companies, it was not widely supported either by victims or corporations.

On April 26, 2005, Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, professor and chair of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, testified before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary against this proposed legislation. He testified that many of the bill&#x27;s provisions were unsupported by medicine and would unfairly exclude a large number of people who had become ill or died from asbestos: &quot;The approach to the diagnosis of disease caused by asbestos that is set forth in this bill is not consistent with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Thoracic Society. If the bill is to deliver on its promise of fairness, these criteria will need to be revised.&quot; Also opposing the bill were the American Public Health Association and the Asbestos Workers&#x27; Union.

On June 14, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved an amendment to the act which would have allowed victims of mesothelioma $1.1M within 30 days of their claim&#x27;s approval. This version would have also expanded eligible claimants to people exposed to asbestos from the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, and to construction debris in hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Ultimately, the bill&#x27;s reliance on funding from private entities large and small, as well as debate over a sunset provision and the impact on the U.S. budgetary process caused the bill to fail to leave committee.

Since the bankruptcy filing of Johns-Manville in 1984, many U.S. and U.K. asbestos manufacturers have escaped litigation by filing bankruptcy. Once in bankruptcy, these companies typically are required to fund special &quot;bankruptcy trusts&quot; that pay pennies on the dollar to injured parties. However, these trusts do permit larger numbers of claimants to receive some kind of compensation, even if greatly reduced from potential recoveries in the tort system.

Since 2002, asbestos lawsuits in the U.S. have included the following as defendants:
# Manufacturers of machinery that are alleged to have required asbestos-containing parts to function properly;
# Owners of premises at which asbestos-containing products were installed (which includes virtually anyone who owned a building prior to 1980);
# Banks that financed ships or buildings where asbestos was installed (on the grounds that no rational lender would take a security interest in an asset without studying the risks involved);
# Retailers of asbestos-containing products (including hardware, home improvement and automotive parts stores);
# Corporations that allegedly conspired with asbestos manufacturers to deliberately conceal the dangers of asbestos (e.g., MetLife, a well-known insurance company which worked with Johns-Manville);
# Manufacturers of tools which were used to cut or shape asbestos-containing parts; and
# Manufacturers of respiratory protective equipment.

Defendants in the first category have contested liability on the grounds that nearly all of them either did not ship asbestos-containing parts with their products at all (that is, asbestos was installed only by end users) or did not sell replacement parts for their own products (in cases where the plaintiff was allegedly exposed well after any factory-original asbestos-containing parts would have been replaced), and either way cannot be responsible for toxic third-party parts that they did not manufacture, distribute, or sell. In 2008, the Washington Supreme Court, the first to reach the issue, decided in favor of the defense. On January 12, 2012, the Supreme Court of California also decided in favor of the defense in &quot;O&#x27;Neil v. Crane Co.&quot; This is significant as a 2007 study found that California and Washington were the two most influential state supreme courts in the United States in the period from 1940 to 2005.

In a decision from January 2014, Gray v. Garlock Sealing Technologies had entered into bankruptcy proceedings, and discovery in the case uncovered evidence of fraud that led to a reduction in estimated future liability to a tenth of what was estimated.

Some defendants raise what is sometimes called the chrysotile-defense, under which manufacturers of some products containing only chrysotile fibers claim that these are not as harmful as amphibole-containing products. As 95% of the products used in the United States historically were mostly chrysotile, this claim is widely disputed by health officials and medical professionals. The World Health Organization recognizes that exposure to all types of asbestos fibers, including chrysotile, can cause cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovary, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

====Criminal prosecutions====
=====Adamo Wrecking Company=====
On February 20, 1973, a federal grand jury in Detroit, Michigan, indicted Adamo Wrecking Company for violating provisions of the Clean Air Act by knowingly causing the emission of asbestos by failure to wet and remove friable asbestos materials from demolitions.

Adamo was one of a number of demolition contractors indicted throughout the country for the alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed the criminal indictment on the ground that it was not an &quot;emission standard,&quot; but a &quot;work practice standard,&quot; which under the terms of the statute, did not carry criminal liability.

The government appealed and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, stating that it erred in determining that it had jurisdiction to review the validity of the standard in a criminal proceeding. Adamo&#x27;s attorneys appealed to the Supreme Court.

On January 10, 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Adamo when it held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to review the standard in a criminal proceeding and also agreed with the trial court that the requirements in the act were &quot;not standards&quot; but &quot;procedures&quot; and therefore the proceedings were properly dismissed.

=====W. R. Grace and Company=====
A federal grand jury indicted W. R. Grace and Company and seven top executives on February 5, 2005, for its operations of a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana. The indictment accused Grace of wire fraud, knowing endangerment of residents by concealing air monitoring results, obstruction of justice by interfering with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation, violation of the Clean Air Act, providing asbestos materials to schools and local residents, and conspiracy to release asbestos and cover up health problems from asbestos contamination. According to the Baltimore Sun the Department of Justice said 1,200 residents had developed asbestos-related diseases and some had died, and there could be many more injuries and deaths.

According to the Baltimore Sun W. R. Grace and Company faced fines of up to $280 million for polluting the town of Libby, Montana. Libby was declared a Superfund disaster area in 2002, and the EPA has spent $54 million in cleanup. Grace was ordered by a court to reimburse the EPA for cleanup costs, but the bankruptcy court must approve any payments.

On June 8, 2006, a federal judge dismissed the conspiracy charge of &quot;knowing endangerment&quot; because some of the defendant officials had left the company before the five-year statute of limitations had begun to run. The wire fraud charge was dropped by prosecutors in March.

=====Unsafe abatement=====

Asbestos abatement (removal of asbestos) has become a thriving industry in the United States. Strict removal and disposal laws have been enacted to protect the public from airborne asbestos. The Clean Air Act requires that asbestos be wetted during removal and strictly contained, and that workers wear safety gear and masks. The federal government has prosecuted dozens of violations of the act and violations of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) related to the operations. Often these involve contractors who hire undocumented workers without proper training or protection to illegally remove asbestos.

On April 2, 1998, three men were indicted in a conspiracy to use homeless men for illegal asbestos removal from an aging Wisconsin manufacturing plant. Then-US Attorney General Janet Reno said, &quot;Knowingly removing asbestos improperly is criminal. Exploiting the homeless to do this work is cruel.&quot;

On December 12, 2004, owners of New York asbestos abatement companies were sentenced to the longest federal jail sentences for environmental crimes in U.S. history, after they were convicted on 18 counts of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, and actual violations of the Clean Air Act and Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The crimes involved a 10-year scheme to illegally remove asbestos. The RICO counts included obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud and bid rigging, all related to the asbestos cleanup.

On January 11, 2006, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., two of its employees, and a contractor were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that they violated safety standards while removing asbestos from pipes in Lemon Grove, California. The defendants were charged with five counts of conspiracy, violating asbestos work practice standards and making false statements.

<text>Controlled combustion engine (CCE) is a term used by TechViki, an engine design company, to identify a type of experimental internal combustion engine (ICE) designed by Brad Howell-Smith. It uses two counter-rotating cams instead of a crankshaft. Pairs of cylinders oppose each other in a boxer flat engine or X engine arrangement.

== History ==

The idea came to Howell-Smith, an automotive engineer residing in Australia, during REM sleep in 1995. He designed five different engine layouts with variations on each and established Revolution Engine Technologies Pty Ltd in 1996 with a budget of A$2,000. The first working prototype was built by father-in-law Peter Koch in Howell-Smith&#x27;s garage. Howell-Smith founded a company named Revetec Limited and set up a research and development site in Sydney. The prototype was displayed at the 1996 Sydney International Motor Show which brought public awareness to the design. Work began on a second prototype intended for use in generators and pumps, however interest expressed by the Middle East automotive market shifted focus towards automotive applications.

== Engine description ==
The Revetec engine design consists of two counter-rotating &quot;trilobate&quot; (three lobed) cams geared together, so both cams contribute to forward motion. Two bearings run along the profile of both cams (four bearings in all) and stay in contact with the cams at all times. The bearings are mounted on the underside of the two inter-connected pistons, which maintain the desired clearance throughout the stroke.

The two cams rotate and raise the piston with a scissor-like action to the bearings. Once at the top of the stroke the air-fuel mixture is fired. This is the power stroke during which the maximum mechanical advantage is reached after the piston has moved approximately 5% of its travel from top dead centre (approx. 10° ATDC), which makes better use of the high cylinder pressures at this point in the cycle. In comparison, a conventional engine reaches its maximum mechanical advantage after the piston has moved approximately 40% of its travel from TDC (approx. 60° ATDC). A side effect of this is a CCE can idle at much lower RPM.

Because the piston assembly only moves in one dimension (unlike the case in an engine with connecting rods), contact with the cylinder wall is minimised, which reduces wear and lubrication requirements. The cams create less piston shock, which allows ceramic components to be used. The engine can run in either direction if symmetrical lobes are used.

The effective cranking distance is determined by the length from the point of bearing contact to the centre of the output shaft (not the stroke).

The dual bearings contact the two cams in the opposite side which cancels the side forces out. The piston assembly does not experience any side force which reduces wear and lubrication requirements at the cylinder contact. One module, which consists of a minimum of five moving components, produces six power strokes per revolution. Increasing the number of lobes on each cam to five produces ten power strokes without increasing the number of components.

== Claimed advantages ==
The following advantages are claimed for the CCE engine at.

* Predicted production power to dressed weight ratio is 0.40 bhp/lb, based on 2007 testing of the X4v2 engine. For comparison a Continental engine is 0.465 hp/lb, dressed
* Efficiency - recent tests gave good results, for a gasoline engine, when running lean.
* Fewer moving and total components. As a result of fewer components, more easily manufactured than conventional engines.
* Identical cylinder head assembly (“top end&quot;) to conventional engines. Most existing head technology can be either adapted or utilised.
* Flexible design - can be four-stroke, two-stroke, petrol, diesel or gas, natural or forced aspiration.
* Eliminated irregularly reciprocating components such as connecting rods. No second order balancing required.
* Output shaft can be run in either direction if multilobed cams with symmetrical lobes are employed. 
* The CCE can be designed to operate at greatly reduced operating speeds while delivering high torque output.
* Substantial reduction in stroke reduces heat loss through cylinder wall.
* Extended piston dwell is possible because engine design allows a lower than normal compression ratio to be used reducing power loss from compression cycle.
* Able to fire on a leaner mixture than conventional engines. 
* Maximum mechanical advantage can be applied to output shaft at only 20 degrees ATDC utilising high cylinder pressure early in the stroke, compared to around 60 degrees ATDC for conventional engines.
* Lower emissions can be achieved due to increased control over combustion.
* Low idle speed due to increase in mechanical efficiency at the top of the stroke.
* Little or no bore contact/piston side thrust, which reduces wear on cylinder bore.
* Can have different port timing on compression stroke than power stroke allowing better control.
* Lower centre of gravity on the boxer design. 
* Due to controlled piston acceleration rates the CCE reduces engine vibration. 
* A hollow output shaft can be utilised for specialty applications, such as peristaltic pumps.

== Disadvantages ==
The following have yet to be verified independently.

* Vibration
* Reliability, especially when running lean as is required for good economy.
* Emissions

== Patents ==
U.S. Patent 5,992,356 &quot;Opposed piston combustion engine &quot;; November 30, 1999; Howell-Smith; Bradley David (Worongary, AU).

Revetec has a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application pending for the &quot;X&quot; design lodged late 2006.

== Performance ==
A dyno graph of the Revetec 1.38litr engine is shown on their development page, shows a flat torque curve.

Test results (11 November 2007) on the X4v2 engine showing torque and power curves and the fuel injection map.

In April 2008, Revetec completed their first Independently Certified Test Report carried out by Orbital Australia, achieving a repeatable BSFC figure of 212g/kW-h (38.6% efficiency).

<doc id="1298984" wikidata="Q882343" url="?curid=1298984" title="Blue Skies (1946 film)">
<text>Blue Skies is a 1946 American musical comedy film directed by Stuart Heisler and starring Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, and Joan Caulfield. Based on a story by Irving Berlin, the film is about a dancer who loves a showgirl who loves a compulsive nightclub-opener who can&#x27;t stay committed to anything in life for very long. Produced by Sol C. Siegel, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; was filmed in Technicolor and released by Paramount Pictures. The music, lyrics, and story were written by Irving Berlin, with most of the songs recycled from earlier works.

As in &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), the film is designed to showcase Berlin&#x27;s songs. The plot, which is presented in a series of flashbacks with Astaire as narrator, follows a similar formula of Crosby beating Astaire for the affections of a leading lady. Comedy is principally provided by Billy De Wolfe, and several musical numbers are performed by Olga San Juan.

Joan Caulfield was the protégé of Mark Sandrich, who directed many of the Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals. Sandrich was originally slated to direct this film, but died of a heart attack during pre-production and Stuart Heisler was drafted in to replace him. Heisler wanted Caulfield replaced, but Crosby—who was having an affair with Caulfield—protected her.

Tap dancer Paul Draper was the initial choice to partner Crosby, but, during the first week of production, Draper&#x27;s speech impediment and his trenchant criticism of Caulfield&#x27;s dance ability led Crosby to insist on his replacement by Astaire, who, then 47, decided that this would be his final film and that he would subsequently retire, having spent over 40 years performing before the public. The film was billed as &quot;Astaire&#x27;s last picture&quot; and its very strong performance at the box office pleased him greatly, as he had dearly wanted to go out on a high note.

The reasons for Astaire&#x27;s (temporary) retirement remain a source of debate: his own view that he was &quot;tired and running out of gas,&quot; the sudden collapse in 1945 of the market for Swing music which left many of his colleagues in jazz high and dry, a desire to devote time to establishing a chain of dancing schools, and a dissatisfaction with roles, as in this film, where he was relegated to playing second fiddle to the lead. This film is most remembered by some today for his celebrated solo performance of &quot;Puttin&#x27; On The Ritz&quot;, which featured Astaire leading an entire dance line of Astaires.

==Plot==
The story is told in a series of vignettes and musical numbers that serve to show events in flashback. Our narrative link is New York radio star Jed Potter, who once was a renowned Broadway hoofer. The conceit is that he is on the air, telling his life story, which does not yet have an ending.

The tale starts just after World War I and centers on two men who became friends in the Army: rising dancer Potter and business-minded Johnny Adams. While hardworking Potter dreams of stardom, the more laid-back and less disciplined Adams has hopes of becoming a successful nightclub owner.

In time, dancer Potter falls in love with a band singer, Mary O&#x27;Hara. He takes Mary to Adams&#x27; nightclub, where she takes a shine to Adams. Potter warns Mary that his old buddy is not the marrying kind, but she marries Adams. The union is not a happy one, despite the birth of a child. Adams&#x27; nightclub business is anything but a resounding success, and it turns out Potter was right: Adams is self-centered and unable to commit to his nightclubs, his marriage, or his daughter.

The couple divorces, and Mary tries again with Potter. The two even become engaged, but Mary can&#x27;t go through with the wedding and takes off. A devastated Potter turns to booze and subsequently suffers an accident that puts an end to his dancing career. He winds up behind a radio microphone, sharing his story with his audience, hoping that wherever Mary is, she can hear him.

==Production==
Joan Caulfield was pulled out of the film. But Paramount changed their mind and put her back in.

==Reception==
In its initial release period in the US, the movie took in $5 million in rental income, making it one of the box office successes of the year. &quot;Variety&quot; gave a favorable review. &quot;&#x27;Blue Skies&#x27; is another in the show biz cavalcade cycle and it&#x27;ll spell beaucoup blue skies and black ink for any exhibitor. With Crosby, Astaire and Joan Caulfield on the marquee, a wealth of Irving Berlin songs and lush Technicolor production values, this filmusical can&#x27;t miss for terrific grosses. . .Certainly, for Astaire, it&#x27;s perhaps a new triumph. If he ever seriously thought of retiring, &#x27;Skies&#x27; should postpone any such ideas...Crosby is Crosby although a slightly heftier Bing. He&#x27;s the same troubadour, chirping the ditties as only Crosby does even though his waistline is somewhat more generous than behooves a juve.&quot;

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; liked it too. &quot;So many screen exercises in the music-album line have been so cluttered up with &#x27;biography&#x27; that it is a pleasure at last to see one in which a tune-vender&#x27;s life and his music are not mutually and mawkishly abused. Such a one is the Paramount&#x27;s current and cheerfully diverting &quot;Blue Skies,&quot; which catalogues some songs of Irving Berlin without catalyzing that gentleman&#x27;s career. And with Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby as its bright particular stars, everyone&#x27;s probity is honored by it—especially Mr. Berlin&#x27;s.&quot;

At the 19th Academy Awards, honoring the films from 1946, Blue Skies was nominated for two Oscars: Best MUSIC (Scoring of a Musical Picture) - Robert Emmett Dolan and Best MUSIC (Song) - &quot;You Keep Coming Back Like A Song&quot;, Music and Lyrics by Irving Berlin. The awards, however, went to The Jolson Story – Morris Stoloff and &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot; from The Harvey Girls – Music by Harry Warren; Lyrics by Johnny Mercer.

==Soundtrack and dance routines==
Crosby applies his famous relaxed crooning style to the many songs he delivers here. In contrast, Astaire, assisted by choreographers Hermes Pan and Dave Robel (for the &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot; routine), delivers a series of dances which explore the theme of confrontation, both with partners and with the audience. As a result, it is one of only a few Astaire films not to feature a romantic-partnered dance.

* &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot;: Berlin&#x27;s 1919 song is presented as part of a big Ziegfeld Follies production number, an aesthetic which Astaire parodies in this partnered dance with Caulfield and others. In the first of a series of references to films he made earlier in the 1940s, he reprises a tap sequence performed atop a bar counter in the &quot;One for My Baby&quot; number from &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1943), this time danced down a stairway.
* &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Captain Working for Me Now&quot;: This song, composed in 1919, is performed by Crosby, backed up by Billy De Wolfe.
* &quot;You&#x27;d Be Surprised&quot;: Another 1919 song, this time performed by Olga San Juan.
* &quot;All by Myself&quot;: Crosby performs this 1921 song to Caulfield, who harmonizes with him in the closing phrases.
* &quot;Serenade to an Old-Fashioned Girl&quot;: Caulfield sings this number, specially written for the film.
* &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;: Although Berlin&#x27;s 1930 song was originally written for vaudevillian Harry Richman, it has become indelibly associated with Astaire, who also recorded it for Columbia in 1930. In this tap solo with cane, which was widely billed as &quot;Astaire&#x27;s last dance&quot;, the lyrics are updated, replacing references to ritzy Harlemites with wealthy whites strutting their stuff up and down Park Avenue. The routine was produced after the rest of the film had been completed, and according to Astaire, it took &quot;five weeks of back-breaking physical work&quot; to prepare. It is constructed in three sections, beginning in a book-lined office with Astaire dressed in a morning suit. Here Astaire delivers the song while executing a gentle tap and cane solo in mock slow-motion, in an amusing parody of his impending retirement. The song finished, he returns to dancing at normal speed and dances around the office while executing an ingenious jumping cane routine, which relied on a concealed floor trigger mechanism. Rejuvenated, Astaire sweeps aside a pair of drab curtains to reveal a chorus of nine Fred Astaires – achieved by filming three separate versions of Astaire and interleaving them. The final section of the number is a repeat of the tune with a greatly reduced tempo, which accompanies a complex routine for Astaire and chorus. In &quot;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&quot; from &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), Astaire pretended to machine-gun his chorus dancers with his cane and loud taps. This time, Astaire joins his chorus in adopting a confrontational, at times almost menacing posture towards his audience. In 1957, on the brink of yet another temporary retirement, Astaire wittily refers back to this routine in the self-parodying &quot;The Ritz, Roll And Rock&quot; number from &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;.
* &quot;(I&#x27;ll See You In) C-U-B-A&quot;: A 1920 song performed as a duet by Crosby and San Juan.
* &quot;A Couple of Song and Dance Men&quot;: A comic song and dance duet for Astaire and Crosby to a number specially composed for the film. The concept is a reworking of the &quot;I&#x27;ll Capture Your Heart&quot; number from &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942) and the comedy centres on Crosby&#x27;s legendary reluctance to rehearse.
* &quot;You Keep Coming Back Like a Song&quot;: Crosby performs this specially composed number.
* &quot;Blue Skies&quot;: Crosby sings this 1926 ballad, the film&#x27;s title song, to Caulfield.
* &quot;Nightclub Montage&quot;: Crosby performs fragments of &quot;The Little Things In Life&quot; (1930), &quot;Not for All the Rice In China&quot; (1933) and &quot;Russian Lullaby&quot; (1927).
* &quot;Everybody Step&quot;: Crosby sings this 1921 number, followed by a brief dance for chorus choreographed by Hermes Pan. Crosby directs the chorus in the opening stages, a concept revived and further developed by Pan for the opening number of &quot;An Evening with Fred Astaire&quot; (1958).
* &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean?&quot;: Crosby performs this 1932 song in a musing style, backed by a female quartet.
* &quot;(Running Around In Circles) Getting Nowhere&quot;: Crosby sings this specially composed song to his daughter, played by Karolyn Grimes.
* &quot;Heat Wave&quot;: The film&#x27;s major production number features Astaire, Olga San Juan and chorus in a brightly coloured Latin-themed setting. It begins with San Juan&#x27;s rendition – with the lyric &quot;making her seat wave&quot; toned down to &quot;making her feet wave&quot; – of this 1933 song, while Astaire approaches warily, using dance steps reminiscent of those used in the &quot;Dream Ballet&quot; number from &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot; (1945), followed by a partnered dance for Astaire and San Juan, and then a tap solo section for Astaire who quotes from the &quot;Boogie Barcarolle (Rehearsal Sequence)&quot; number from &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; (1941). This solo section was shot in one take and features music specially composed by Astaire, the only time his music was used in a film. In a counterpoint to the film&#x27;s opening number, this number ends with him ascending a staircase, only to fall dramatically from a precipice, ending his character&#x27;s dance career.
* &quot;Wartime Medley&quot;: Crosby performs excerpts from &quot;Any Bonds Today&quot; (1941), &quot;This Is The Army, Mr. Jones&quot; (1942) and &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1942) – which he had introduced in his previous film with Astaire: &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942).
* &quot;You Keep Coming Back Like a Song/Blue Skies (reprise)&quot;: Performed by Crosby and Caulfield at the film&#x27;s close.

The other Berlin songs which featured only as background music in the film are, in order of use: &quot;Tell Me Little Gypsy&quot; (1920), &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; (1920), &quot;Mandy&quot; (1918), &quot;I Wonder&quot; (1919), &quot;Some Sunny Day&quot; (1922), &quot;When You Walked Out Someone Else Walked In&quot; (1923), &quot;Because I Love You&quot; (1926), &quot;Homesick&quot; (1922), &quot;How Many Times&quot; (1926), &quot;The Song Is Ended&quot; (1927), &quot;Lazy&quot; (1924), &quot;Always&quot; (1925) and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Remember&quot; (1933).
Other Irving Berlin sings which were recorded by Bing Crosby for the film soundtrack but omitted from the released print were &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do&quot;, &quot;All Alone&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket&quot;, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; and &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

Bing Crosby recorded many of the songs for Decca Records. and these were also issued as a 5-disc, 78 rpm album titled Blue Skies (Decca album). &quot;You Keep Coming Back Like a Song&quot; was in the Billboard charts for six weeks with a peak position of #12. Crosby&#x27;s songs were also included in the Bing&#x27;s Hollywood series.

==Reception==
According to &quot;Variety&quot; the film earned $5 million in rentals in 1946.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

<text>Münnerstadt is a town in the district of Bad Kissingen in Bavaria, Germany. It has a population of around 7,600.

==Geography==
It borders on the towns of Burglauer, Bad Bocklet, Nüdlingen, Maßbach, Großbardorf, and Strahlungen. The municipal territory covers an area of 95 km2.

The town is located in the southern portion of the &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; Rhön. The Lauer river (a tributary of the Franconian Saale) flows directly through the town.

==History==
The area around Münnerstadt has been inhabited at least since approximately 2100 BC. Early Celtic settlers farmed in the area of Grosswenkheim, Maria Bildhausen and Althausen (all villages within the municipal boundaries). Around the 1st century AD, Thuringian and soon after, Franconian settlers moved into the area and used the surrounding hills (Michelsberg) and forests for protection in times of danger. By the 5th century AD a village existed in the area where the base of Michelsberg meets the Lauer river.

===Middle Ages===
On 28 December 770, Egi and Sigihilt donated their complete estate including vineyards to the &quot;Munirihestat&quot; monastery of Fulda. This was the first certified mention of Münnerstadt. Between 770 and 876 there were 18 certificates that proved Münnerstadt was of great importance during the Carolingian period. 

In 1156 Hermann von Stahleck sponsored the construction of the abbey in Maria Bildhausen. In the 12th century Count Henneberg began to establish his presence in Münnerstadt. Henneberg was also the name of the state of the Holy Roman Empire in which Münnerstadt was located. At this time Henneberg built a small castle on the Lauer river and the inhabitants of the old Münnerstadt left their unprotected dwellings and moved within the shadows of the new castle.

Early in the 13th century Münnerstadt began the fortification of the town with the construction of a wall (1251) and four gates around the entire town to protect them from invading forces. With the addition of the Market (1271), the town court, town council (1279) and town seal (1287), Münnerstadt began a period of prosperity. The grain measurement was the standard in 38 towns in Lower Franconia. In 1231 the Teutonic Knights took over the Ministry of Münnerstadt. In 1279 the Augustinian abbey in Münnerstadt was established.

As a result of the growth and prosperity brought upon Münnerstadt by Count von Henneberg, Emperor Louis IV gave the community its town rights. Münnerstadt became an important base against the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, but inheritance and financial problems in the mid-14th century led to Würzburg taking over some assets in Münnerstadt. In the late 14th century the town inhabitants rose up to drive out both of the ruling princes but were crushed. In 1385 new laws were established that governed the way of life within the walls of the town. 

In 1490, the town council sponsored the construction of an altar in the &quot;Pfarrkirche&quot; (parish church) by noted artist Tilman Riemenschneider. This was his first contract for a large altar.

In the early 16th century Martin Luther&#x27;s predication created an uproar by the farmers and citizens who burned down the abbey of Maria Bildhausen, but the riot was quelled by the hard reprisal by the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg. The Augustinian monks had to leave town when the first Protestant priest took over the Ministry of Münnerstadt in 1552. In 1585 Prince-Bischop Julius Echter purchased a large part of the town that was not already owned by the Bishops of Würzburg. As a result, approximately 400 Protestants, mostly craftsmen, left the town. In 1631 the region suffered from the effects of the Thirty Years&#x27; war. Swedish invaders took the town. In 1641 a miracle is supposed to have taken place that protected Münnerstadt from more devastation. The Augustinians returned in 1652, rebuilding their abbey and in 1685 they took back control of the Ministry of Münnerstadt.

===Annexation===
During the Napoleonic Wars, Franconia, and with it Münnerstadt, was annexed by Bavaria in 1803. During mediatisation the abbey of Maria Bildhausen was disbanded, the buildings sold or destroyed. In 1804 Münnerstadt became the seat of a federal court. The Teutonic Order was required to leave the town and its possessions were claimed by the town council. The Congress of Vienna later officially awarded Franconia and Münnerstadt to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The town was the local government seat but continued to lose importance. By the early 1900s it was just a locality in the district of Bad Kissingen.

===Modern times===
During World War II, the &quot;Marienkapelle&quot;, houses and one of the town gates were destroyed by bombing and upon entry of the U.S. forces into the town. With the establishment of East Germany, businesses from Thuringia relocated to Münnerstadt. Some of them have attained international importance.

In 1990, traffic on the was rerouted from the town center to the west side of town and the railway to Erfurt was opened after a 50 years&#x27; pause. In the winter of 2005 Autobahn 71 was opened for traffic. Its bridge between Münnerstadt and Althausen had a major impact on the local landscape.

==Governance==
===Mayor===
Since May 2008 the mayor of Münnerstadt has been 2008 Helmut Blank (CSU). He was reelected in 2014 with 60.3% of the votes. In March 2020 Michael Kastl was elected mayor.

<doc id="1299019" wikidata="Q30850" url="?curid=1299019" title="Meitetsu">
<text>, often abbreviated to as , is a private railway company operating around Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture of Japan. 

Some of the more famous trains operated by Meitetsu include the &quot;Panorama Car&quot; and the &quot;Panorama Car Super&quot;, both of which offer views through their wide front windows. While the &quot;Panorama Super&quot; train is used extensively for the railroad&#x27;s limited express service, the older and more energy-consuming &quot;Panorama Car&quot; train has been retired, the last run being on 27 December 2008.

In the Tōkai region around Nagoya, it is a central firm of the Meitetsu Group, which is involved in transport, retail trade, service industry, and real estate, among other industries.

As of March 2023, Meitetsu operated of track, 275 stations, and 1,076 train cars, being one of the largest private railway companies in Japan.

== History ==
Meitetsu was founded on June 25, 1894, as the Aichi Horsecar Company.

Over time, Meitetsu has acquired many small railway and interurban companies in the Nagoya area, many of whom were constructed and operated before and during World War II. For example, Meitetsu acquired its Kōwa Line on the Chita Peninsula from its merger with Chita Railroad on February 1, 1943, and it acquired its Mikawa Line from its merger with Mikawa Railroad.

Meitetsu is famous for its red trains, including its famous 7000 series &quot;Panorama Car&quot; which was retired in 2009 after a career lasting nearly half a century. The most recent cars, however, are not solid red but rather brushed steel as in the case of the 4000 series and 5000 series, or white as in the case of the 1700 series and 2000 series.

While the company used to engage in the freight business and still possesses some freight locomotives, it no longer carries freight on a regular basis.

==Rolling stock==

Nippon Sharyo has produced nearly every car that Meitetsu operates or has operated, a notable exception being its Class EL120, an electric locomotive, which was produced by Toshiba, but very few units were produced for Meitetsu. The Class EL120 is one of the few locomotives that Meitetsu possesses.

==Rationalization==
Meitetsu inherited many deficit lines as a result of multiple mergers. The railway lines were also seeing competition from cars due to Aichi prefecture&#x27;s notable automobile industry in cities such as Toyota. Meitetsu has abolished over 15 lines over the past 70 years, while also closing sections with low ridership. Additionally, with the collapse of the asset price bubble in the 1990s, and the privatization of JNR, formation of Central Japan Railway Company, the company also cut the number of companies in its corporate group from 250 to 139.

<text>The Volvo 440 and 460 are versions of a small family car produced by the Swedish manufacturer Volvo between June 1988 and September 1996. The 440 was a five-door hatchback and the 460 a four-door saloon which followed in 1989. They were built at the NedCar factory in Born, the Netherlands and were only offered with front-wheel drive.

They shared many components with the earlier Volvo 480 coupé, including floorpan, front and rear suspension, engines from Renault, transmissions, and braking systems.

==Design and styling==

The Volvo 440/460 Series models were designed to fit in below Volvo&#x27;s bigger saloon and estate cars as a replacement to the 340/360 Series, to compete with the likes of the Ford Sierra.

Development of the 440/460/480 started in 1978, as part of the &quot;Galaxy Project&quot; which was to create two lines of front-wheel drive cars to replace the 300- and 200-series. The smaller line was called G1, while the larger G2 was to become the new Volvo 850. The first G1 mule, designed by Jan Wilsgaard and called the G4, was completed in September 1980 and looked largely identical to the finished Volvo 440. The G1 project was split into three branches, the G13 becoming the 480, the G14 the 460, and the G15 the 440. In 1982, the entire project was sold by Volvo to Volvo Car B.V. in the Netherlands (the successor company to DAF), who started work on the 480 coupé version. As was Volvo&#x27;s tradition, a new line of cars was always introduced with the most expensive and lowest selling model first, allowing Volvo time to iron out any problems before starting volume production.

The 480 had a lot of problems in its first year of production, and the Dutch office did not have the manpower to complete the G15 (440). A lot of the work was thus subcontracted to two English companies. With the project being shifted to the Netherlands, then partially shifted to England, and further held up by the troubled gestation and initial production of the 480, the 440 looked rather dated by the time it was introduced. While the actual design is credited to Peter van Kuilenburg, Gothenburg had laid down a lot of design provisions since this was to be a volume product for the company, and the final result looked near identical to Wilsgaard&#x27;s 1980 design. A station wagon was never offered, to avoid competing directly with the larger 240 and 740 wagons. This did not stop independent suppliers ASC and Heuliez from designing station wagon models and presenting them to Volvo, while the Dutch company Toncar sold a bolt-on conversion which replaced the 440&#x27;s tailgate with an add-on station wagon structure.

First generation 400 series cars resemble the bigger 940, whilst the facelifted example bore a resemblance to the Volvo 850 to increase sales. The interiors of the 400-series variants were designed by British Volvo designer Peter Horbury.
== Safety ==
Safety has always been an issue of primary importance to Volvo, who have developed many features since adopted widely throughout the car industry. Crumple zones were carried on from the previous 300 series into the design of 400 series cars. This aided by the addition of optional seatbelt pre-tensioners and airbags both for driver and front passenger in early 1991.

Other safety items included a high level brake light; a &#x27;bulb blown&#x27; warning system; &#x27;door open&#x27; warning light; a seatbelt reminder/warning light: all of which all came as standard on all models throughout the range.

Safety was further improved on models from 1993 onward with the introduction of Side Impact Protection System (or SIPS). This was virtually unheard of at the time, and was provided (again as standard) by the forerunner of the SIPS system used on all modern Volvo cars. United Kingdom models also included daytime running lights as standard, although these could be disabled by the dealer at the owner&#x27;s request.

The original advertising campaign for the 400 range centred on occupant safety. A family of crash test dummies appeared to &#x27;survive&#x27; intact after driving the car through a plate glass office window some storeys up. Various other scenarios simulating crashes were employed in addition, all of which ended with the family walking away relatively unharmed — only to be used again in further crash tests.

== Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) option ==
At launch, Volvo decided to offer a four-speed ZF conventional style automatic transmission, even as they spent a few more years redesigning the DAF-derived constantly variable transmission (CVT) to work with engines with more torque than the ones used in the Volvo 340. The majority of automatic 440/460s thus had a conventional four-speed automatic.

The CVT transmission, as fitted to the last generation 440/460 Series, used steel belts (as opposed to the rubber belts used in the 300 Series) and was known as Transmatic, although cars equipped with this auto box were marketed &quot;HTA&quot; (short for &quot;High Tech Auto&quot;).

The Transmatic differs greatly in its construction, and apart from the basic CVT principle of belts running in expanding pulleys, it has nothing in common with the &quot;Variomatic&quot; CVT used in the earlier 300 Series.

Whilst the Variomatic system was completely exposed to the elements at the rear of the car and used dry rubber belts, Transmatic was mounted transversely in the front of the car, and featured steel belts running in oil within a sealed gearbox casing. Subsequent CVT transmissions (such as Audi&#x27;s Multitronic), have continued to use this configuration.

The HTA gearbox was subsequently used in Rover&#x27;s Metro redesigned model (last generation) and carries the &quot;VT-1&quot; model component number.

== Standard specifications ==
The specifications of most models of 440 and 460 were relatively high when compared with similarly priced alternatives. The list of options included as &#x27;standard&#x27; grew and changed regularly throughout the lifespan of the car, varying from country to country and later also differing according to trim level. Furthermore, various &#x27;special editions&#x27; were also introduced with equipment differing from that found as standard on all other models; making any more general comparison difficult.

Heated front seats were found across the entire range, as was a five speed gearbox; adjustable seatbelt with pre tensioners; folding two thirds split rear seats; lockable glovebox with light; and boot and ashtray lights.

Options listed as standard on later models include anti-lock brakes (ABS); traction control; front fog lights; separate reading lights for passengers in the back (located in the rear grab handles and cleverly shielded from the driver&#x27;s view); Radio/cassette player with six high fidelity Blaupunkt stereo speakers; tinted UV blocking windows; Map reading lights; Graduated sun visor; Self-supporting (propless) bonnet; rear window wash/wipe; lumbar support; electric windows/mirrors; heated wing mirrors; central locking; tachometer. The driver&#x27;s console on all models housed an array of warning lights, a rheostat and a lambda sensor monitor.

There were two generations of 440/460: the facelift model replaced the original model in the autumn of 1993, for the 1994 model year. Changes included a new bonnet and nose, new rear light clusters, body coloured bumpers, a different grille and numerous new options of engine, spec. level and equipment. The changes made the cars resemble the very successful Volvo 850 model more closely.

== Engines ==
Both 440 and 460 had a 1.7 litre Renault engine at launch, carried over from the Volvo 300 Series; this was available between 1988 and 1992 in two different versions with a carburettor, and or and 130 Nm, multipoint fuel injection in two different versions with either and or and in the early GLT models and with multipoint fuel injection and no catalytic converter. The simplest, carburetted version was not immediately available. 

The standard, fuel injected and catalyzed 1,721 cc powerplant produced and a claimed top speed of , which was marginally superior to some of its contemporary counterparts, such as the Volkswagen Passat and the Opel Vectra, as their 1.8 litre engines only had 90 bhp. The turbocharged version offered , and a claimed top speed of . This kind of performance put it on par with higher end 1.8 litre engines, or contemporary 2.0 litre engines, but at a significant cost increase. In August 1991, the lower cost 440/460 DL now became equipped with a somewhat larger, 1,794 cc with single-point fuel injection and . Thanks to the slight displacement increase, however, torque remained nearly identical.

From 1992, the engines offered were substantially different, with the range now including a 1.6i with as well as the 1.8 from the DL and a 2.0i with . The naturally aspirated 1.7-litre was discontinued but the turbo option from the pre-facelift version remained unchanged. The 1.6 was equipped with multi point fuel injection; the 1.8 engine had single point injection, and the 2.0 came with a choice of single point and multi point injection units, the older 1.7 turbocharged version however had more power.

From 1994, the engines became slightly more powerful. Diesel versions also became available: a 1.9-litre Renault turbodiesel option with was offered, badged as either TD or Turbo Diesel depending on which European market the car was sold in. Volvo also released a limited market 1.8 HTA, the &quot;High Tech Auto&quot;, using a much improved electric belt assisted CVT auto transmission, but it was short lived and slow selling.

== Trim levels ==
In the United Kingdom, equipment levels were different from mainland Europe. Early cars were available in L, GL, GLE, GLEi, GLT and Turbo trims. The L and GL trim levels were basic; GLE was plush and along with the GL model offered split rear seats compared to the fixed one piece rear bench on the L model; the GLT was a well equipped, mildly sporting trim level. GLT and Turbo were externally similar, both featuring lowered sports suspension and a large rear spoiler. Other trim levels were gradually phased in, such as limited edition Si and Xi, and Turbo later became simply an engine variant, rather than a full trim variant. In early 1991, the black plastic rear view mirrors were replaced by body colored ones.

From 1992, the range was the same for a year and a half. As a result of the facelift of 1994, the range altered drastically. Trim levels were now: base, S (which was intended as a &quot;family&quot; variant), Si (intended as a &quot;sports&quot; variant), SE (&quot;business&quot; variant), GLT (&quot;performance&quot; variant) and CD (&quot;luxury&quot; variant) trims. An Li model also appeared in 1994, offering base spec with the addition of power steering (and, on later models, a sunroof).

From at least 1995 onwards, all engine choices were available with all trim levels. The later Si models and all GLT models were easily distinguishable from the rest of the range, due to the additions of sports suspension (making the car ride visibly lower) and a large rear spoiler. The GLT&#x27;s specification was, however, significantly higher in featuring part leather upholstery, alloy wheels, ABS, traction control and an uprated stereo system as standard equipment.

The SE was also slightly more distinguishable, having a small rear spoiler which it shared only with the limited edition ES pack model. The ES pack could be added to cars of any engine variant from late 1995. It featured sports suspension, 15&quot; alloy wheels, metallic paint, door sill decals, electric front windows, electric heated mirrors, front and rear armrests, ABS and immobiliser in addition to the small spoiler and an uprated stereo unit.

The S model was also notable, having two foldout child booster seats integrated into the car&#x27;s rear seat, a dustbin incorporated in the dashboard and rear headrests. However unlike all the 300 Series, the 440 had, at last split rear seats fitted, though only the basic models lacked a split.

Specification of all later cars was high, with many featuring air conditioning – particularly as a result of a special offer operated by Volvo in the United Kingdom in 1995, where £100 deleted the standard electric glass sunroof from the car&#x27;s specification in favour of air conditioning and 15&quot; alloy wheels, identical to those fitted to Volvo 850 CD models, albeit with lower-profile tyres.

The luxury CD trim came particularly well-specified especially on the later, facelifted cars, with features such as heated black leather seats, interior burr walnut fascia trim, Air-conditioning, electrically operated &amp; heated door mirrors, remote central locking, electric windows (front and rear), electric aerial, premium Volvo RDS radio cassette, thick pile carpeting, alloy wheels as well as ABS. The CD trim level could be optioned with any engine with the exception of the 1.9 Turbo Diesel, where the GLT was the highest available trim line.

The line up was reduced (for example, the Si and GLT models were replaced by the GS, which had all of the Si&#x27;s equipment and some of the GLT&#x27;s, such as ABS) prior to production ceasing in late summer 1996, when the Volvo S40/V40, which shared its platform with the Mitsubishi Carisma, replaced the 440/460 Series.

===Mainland Europe===
In most European markets, the original trim levels consisted of GL, GLE, GLT, and Turbo. The lower cost DL model, while announced for some markets from the beginning, arrived a little bite later as the carburetted engine was not initially ready for sale. In some markets, such as Sweden, this model only arrived in August 1991 (for the 1992 model year).

<text>The New Ghostwriter Mysteries is a Canadian-American children&#x27;s television series that aired on CBS from September 14 to December 7, 1997. It was loosely based on the PBS series &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; (1992–1995). &quot;The New Ghostwriter Mysteries&quot; was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.
The show was filmed in Toronto, Canada, and featured a new team of three kids: Camella Gorik (Charlotte Sullivan), Emilie Robeson (Erica Luttrell), and Henry &quot;Strick&quot; Strickland (Kristian Ayre). Ghostwriter only had two colors, which were silver and gold.

<text>John Houstoun ( ; August 31, 1744 – July 20, 1796) was an American lawyer and statesman from Savannah, Georgia. He was one of the original Sons of Liberty and also a delegate for Georgia in the Second Continental Congress in 1775. He was the Governor of Georgia, in 1778, and again in 1784–1785.

==Personal life==
John was born to aristocratic Scots immigrants in St. George&#x27;s Parish, near modern Waynesboro and the eastern border of Georgia. His parents were Sir Patrick (Baronet) and Priscilla (Dunbar) Houstoun. His father served as the registrar of land grants for the Georgia Colony and the collector of quit-rents (a permanent annual tax on each grant). John was educated in Savannah and read law there. He was admitted to the bar and started a law practice in Savannah.

Houstoun married Hannah Bryan, whose father Jonathan was a wealthy Savannah merchant. They built their home, &quot;White Bluff&quot;, about nine miles (14 km) northwest of Savannah. The couple had no children.

==Revolutionary years==
Houstoun was a successful lawyer, and was appointed to the Governor&#x27;s Council by James Wright. But in 1774, Houstoun was one of the founders of the nascent revolutionary government in Georgia. He joined with Archibald Bulloch and others to form a &quot;Committee of Correspondence&quot; in support of the residents of Boston suffering the effects of the Boston Port Act. The committee went on to create formal protests against other measures brought about by the Intolerable Acts.

That same year, John was a representative in the rebel &quot;Provincial Congress&quot; of Georgia, and they named him as a delegate to the First Continental Congress. He declined, since fewer than half the counties were represented in the Provincial Congress. By 1775 this defect was remedied and he accepted that appointment. In Congress, he was a strong supporter of the movement toward independence, but resisted the non-importation agreements because of their negative effects on the southern colonies.

He was reappointed to the national congress in 1776, but did not attend. He stayed at home to work with the Committee of Safety to thwart the loyalist efforts of the popular preacher and loyalist, John Zubly. Early in 1778, he was elected as the second revolutionary Governor of Georgia also being the first governor of Georgia to be born in Georgia. That same year, he took charge of the Georgia militia in an abortive attempt to seize the British post of St. Augustine, Florida. His disagreements with the Continental Army commander, Robert Howe, contributed greatly to the failure of the expedition. When the British, in response, captured Savannah on December 29, Houstoun was forced into hiding.

Creek Indians raided plantations and carried slaves off from within a few miles of Savannah. The &quot;daily depredations&quot; of these raiding groups, Governor Houstoun wrote, &quot;almost at our very Town-Gates, threaten us with certain ruin unless some remedy is applied.&quot;

Houstoun lived in the Houston–Johnson–Screven House, at 32 Abercorn Street, which was built around 1784. The home was demolished in 1920 to make way for the Lucas Theatre.

==Later career==
After the surrender at Yorktown, the British abandoned Savannah in 1782. Houstoun returned home, taking a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives, where he briefly served as Speaker in 1783. He then was elected to another one-year term as governor in 1784.

Houstoun pushed for more access to the Indian Country. &quot;Formerly when the people of Pensacola and Mobile were one and the same with Us, we did not carry on trade with you from this Country, and then there was no Occasion to ask a Path thro’ the Creek Nation.&quot; Since the Spanish controlled Florida, he wanted more east-west trade routes. The Creeks declined to grant the Choctaws access to the Georgia traders.

On September 28, 1784, Governor John Houstoun granted four 5000 acre tracts of vacant land in Franklin county, Georgia to French Vice Admiral d&#x27;Estaing and his heirs. The four bountyland grants totaling 20,000 acres were subsequently registered on June 13, 1785.

In 1790 he became the first elected Mayor of Savannah, and in 1791 was appointed a justice of the Superior Court of Georgia. After 1792 he served as president of the Chatham Academy.

==Legacy==

Houstoun died at his home, &quot;White Bluff&quot;, just outside Savannah on July 20, 1796. Houston County in central Georgia was named for him. The variation in spelling is typical of early nineteenth century orthography.

<text>Daniel John Haren (born September 17, 1980) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Haren played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Washington Nationals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Miami Marlins, and Chicago Cubs. He now serves as a pitching strategist with the Diamondbacks.

Haren starred for the baseball teams at Bishop Amat High School and Pepperdine University before the Cardinals selected him in the second round of the 2001 MLB draft. After he made his MLB debut in 2003, the Cardinals traded him to the Athletics to get Mark Mulder. After his first All-Star season in 2007, the Athletics traded him to the Diamondbacks for prospects. After appearing in two more All-Star Games in 2008 and 2009, the Diamondbacks traded him to the Angels during the 2010 season for Joe Saunders and pitching prospects. A free agent after the 2012 season, he pitched for the Nationals in 2013, and then signed with the Dodgers for the 2014 season. The Dodgers traded Haren to Miami after the 2014 season. On July 31, 2015, Haren was traded to the Chicago Cubs for two minor league prospects.

Haren is one of a small number of MLB pitchers to have beaten all 30 Major League teams. Although he was never a particularly well-known player, Haren finished his career with three All Star game appearances and the seventh best strikeout-to-walk ratio in major league history.

==Early life==
Daniel John Haren was born on September 17, 1980, in Monterey Park, California. Haren attended Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, California, where he played for the school&#x27;s baseball team as a first baseman. He was named All-San Gabriel Valley.

==College career==
After he graduated from Bishop Amat, Haren enrolled at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, on a college baseball scholarship. Playing for the Pepperdine Waves baseball team, he was selected as West Coast Conference (WCC) Freshman of the Year in 1999. As a sophomore in 2000, Haren had an 8-5 win–loss record and a 3.08 earned run average (ERA). In the 2001 season, his junior year, Haren posted a 2.22 ERA in 17 starts, while teammate Noah Lowry posted a 1.71 ERA in 18 starts. Haren was named WCC Player of the Year and Lowry was Pitcher of the Year. Haren also was a Second team College All-America. The teammates skipped their senior seasons, and Lowry was taken in the first round (30th overall) by the San Francisco Giants and Haren was taken in the second round (72nd overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2001 Major League Baseball draft.

==Professional career==

===Draft and minor leagues===
Haren made his professional debut with the New Jersey Cardinals in 2001 and was 3–3 with a 3.10 ERA in 12 appearances, with eight starts. He also struck out 57 while only walking eight. He then made 28 starts in A-ball in 2002 for the Peoria Chiefs and Potomac Cannons, finishing with a combined ERA of 2.74. He started 2003 in Double-A with the Tennessee Smokies, but was promoted after eight starts to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. He was a combined 8–1 with a 2.68 ERA in 16 starts in 2003, with 84 strikeouts and was selected as the Cardinals minor league pitcher of the year.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2003–2004)===
Haren made his major league debut at the age of 22, on June 30, 2003. He was the starting pitcher against the San Francisco Giants and allowed four runs (two earned) in six innings to pick up the loss. He recorded his first Major League win with a six-inning start where he allowed only one run against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 19. After finishing 2003 with a 5.08 ERA for the Cardinals in 14 starts, he was sent back down to AAA Memphis for the 2004 season. He received a late-season call-up, and made five appearances in the postseason for the Cardinals, including two in the World Series. The Cardinals were swept by the Boston Red Sox, but Haren pitched well, tossing 4 scoreless innings.

===Oakland Athletics (2005–2007)===
After the 2004 season, the Cardinals traded Haren in a package that included right-handed reliever Kiko Calero and top hitting prospect Daric Barton to the Oakland Athletics for Mark Mulder. Haren went 14–12 with a 3.73 ERA in his first full season as a major leaguer.
In 2005, Haren finished in the top 10 in the American League in the following categories: innings pitched (217, ninth place), strikeouts (163, sixth place), and complete games (three, fourth place).

Furthermore, in 2007, Haren had one of the best seasons among any pitcher in the majors. Haren finished in the top ten in the American League in wins, with 15, strikeouts, with 192, innings pitched, with , strikeout to walk ratio, with 3.49, and finished in the top three in the AL in ERA with 3.07.
In 2007, he was also selected to start the MLB All Star Game.

===Arizona Diamondbacks (2008–2010)===

On December 14, 2007, Haren was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, along with Connor Robertson, for prospects including Carlos González, Brett Anderson, Aaron Cunningham, Greg Smith, Dana Eveland, and Chris Carter. In his first season with the Diamondbacks he was selected to the 2008 All-Star game at Yankee Stadium along with his teammate, Brandon Webb. He finished 2008 with a 3.33 ERA to go along with a 16–8 win–loss record, and a career-high 206 strikeouts in 216 innings. His strikeout to walk ratio of 5.15 was the best in the National League, trailing only Roy Halladay.

On August 6, 2008, Haren agreed to a four-year, $44.75 million contract with a team option for the 2013 season. Haren was also selected as a 2009 NL All-Star, representing the Diamondbacks along with Justin Upton. Haren finished the year with a record of 14–10, 3.14 ERA, and 223 strikeouts in innings, throwing three complete games in 33 starts. He once again led the National League with a strikeout to walk ratio of 5.87, and ranked third in total number of strikeouts and ninth in strikeouts per nine innings (8.75 K/9). His 1.003 WHIP was the best mark in the big leagues.

In 2009, he was named #33 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list. He began the 2010 season with a 7–8 record and a 4.60 ERA through July 25.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2010–2012)===

On July 25, 2010, the Diamondbacks traded Haren to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for starting pitcher Joe Saunders, and minor league pitchers Rafael Rodríguez, Patrick Corbin, and Tyler Skaggs. In 13 games with the Angels to close out the 2010 season, Haren went 5–4 with 75 strikeouts and a 2.87 ERA. His final numbers for the entire season were a 12–12 record, 3.91 ERA, 216 strikeouts and 235 innings in 35 starts.

2011 saw a rebound from Haren, as he pitched to a 16–11 record with a 3.17 ERA in 35 games (34 starts). He struck out 192 in innings and led the American League with a 5.82 strikeout to walk ratio, while throwing a career high four complete games (three shutouts).

On May 24, 2012, Haren recorded a career-high 14 strikeouts in a complete-game shutout against the Seattle Mariners in Seattle, allowing four hits in a 3–0 victory. On November 2, 2012, after an attempt to trade him to the Chicago Cubs for Carlos Mármol fell through, the Angels declined Haren&#x27;s $15.5 million option, instead buying it out for $3.5 million, and he became a free agent.

===Washington Nationals (2013)===
On December 7, 2012, Haren signed a one-year, $13 million contract with the Washington Nationals. After his June 22, 2013, start against the Colorado Rockies, Haren owned a major league-worst 6.15 ERA amongst qualified starters. He had also given up a league-leading number of home runs with 19 home runs surrendered through 15 starts.

Haren was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 25 with right shoulder inflammation. He later explained that the disabled list stint was more for &quot;mental reasons than physical reasons,&quot; as he was lonely with his family remaining in California. Haren finished the 2013 season 10–14 with a 4.67 ERA. After starting the season with a 4–11 record and a 5.79 ERA in his first 18 games, he finished the season with a 6–3 record and a 3.14 ERA in his final 13 games.
===Los Angeles Dodgers (2014)===
On November 25, 2013, Haren signed to a one-year, $10 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The deal included a vesting option for 2015, which became a player option when he pitched 180 innings in 2014. Haren started the season strong, winning five of his first six decisions. However, around the all-star break he had a brief stretch where he pitched poorly, losing five straight starts from July 5 to August 1. He turned it around again and pitched well down the stretch. He finished with a record of 13–11 and an ERA of 4.02 in 32 starts for the Dodgers in 2014. For the year, he finished second in the league in home runs allowed with 27.

After the season, Haren exercised his player option for the 2015 season. Regarding rumors that the Dodgers might trade him, Haren said he only wanted to pitch in Los Angeles, either for the Dodgers or the Angels, and that he had &quot;no interest&quot; in playing for anyone else.

===Miami Marlins (2015)===
On December 10, 2014, the Dodgers traded Haren, Dee Gordon, and Miguel Rojas, to the Miami Marlins in exchange for Andrew Heaney, Chris Hatcher, Austin Barnes, and Enrique Hernández. He voiced his preference to pitch for a team on the West Coast. Although it was reported that Haren had requested a trade, he reported to spring training with the Marlins and denied having requested a trade.

===Chicago Cubs (2015)===
On July 31, 2015, the Marlins traded Haren to the Chicago Cubs for minor leaguers Elliot Soto and Ivan Pineyro. Haren announced he would retire after the 2015 season. Haren stated, &quot;If I don&#x27;t pitch in the postseason, that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s been fun. Hopefully there&#x27;s a lot more games to go. If my name is called, I&#x27;ll be ready.&quot; Between the Marlins and Cubs, Haren went 11–9 with a 3.60 ERA in 32 starts.

==Pitching style==
Haren threw an four-seam fastball, an two-seam fastball, a sharp split-finger fastball, and a spike curve. Haren had also added and relied heavily upon an cut fastball, which he added in 2008 and had credited with rejuvenating his career. The cut fastball made up more than half of his pitch selection to right-handed hitters, with his fastballs and occasional split-finger fastball filling up most of the rest. Against lefties, Haren mixed all of his pitches but used his two-seam fastball the most. His curveball was a change-of-pace pitch, and not a main weapon; he didn&#x27;t throw it much to right-handers or in two-strike counts. By contrast, he threw about half of his splitters with two strikes.

Haren usually had a slow pitching delivery, highlighted by a slight pause in the middle of his windup, that he sped up with runners on base. His pitching style was often dubbed a &quot;chess match&quot; by reporters and announcers (particularly Daron Sutton and Mark Grace of the Diamondbacks&#x27; announcing team) due to his ability to change speeds and throw nearly any pitch in any count (and often throw pitches in succession, i.e., four straight breaking balls), often going against scouting reports, making it particularly difficult to hit him.

==Personal life==
Haren grew up in West Covina, California. He is of Irish and Mexican descent. He and his wife have two children, and live in Orange County, California.

In December 2016, the Diamondbacks hired Haren as a special pitching assistant, applying sabermetrics and other baseball analytics. His current title with the organization is pitching strategist.

<doc id="1299070" wikidata="Q3554861" url="?curid=1299070" title="Varsity Stadium">
<text>Varsity Stadium is an outdoor collegiate football stadium located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is home to the Toronto Varsity Blues, the athletic teams of the University of Toronto. Athletic events have been hosted on the site since 1898; the current stadium was built in 2007 to replace the original permanent stadium built in 1911. Varsity Stadium is also a former home of the Toronto Argonauts, and has previously hosted the Grey Cup, the Vanier Cup, several matches of the 1976 Summer Olympics soccer tournament, and the final game of the North American Soccer League&#x27;s 1984 Soccer Bowl series (which was also the last game played by the original NASL). It is located next to Varsity Arena.

==History==
Athletic teams of the University of Toronto have used the site as an athletic ground since 1898. In 1911, the university opened Varsity Stadium.

===First stadium===
Canadian sprinter Percy Williams set a world record in the 100 metres with a time of 10.3 seconds at Varsity Stadium during the Canadian Track and Field Championships in 1930.

Varsity Stadium has for its entire history been host to the University of Toronto&#x27;s collegiate Canadian football team, the Varsity Blues. However it was, until the opening of Exhibition Stadium in 1959, the home of the Toronto Argonauts of what would become the Canadian Football League. Although it has not hosted a meaningful CFL game in almost half a century, it still holds the record for the number of times any stadium has hosted the Canadian professional football championship game, the Grey Cup. Capacity of the stadium has varied with time, but peaked at about 22,000 in the 1950s although, with the use of temporary bleachers, a record crowd of 27,425 watched the Edmonton Eskimos defeat the Montreal Alouettes 50–27 in the 1956 Grey Cup final. Perhaps the most famous Canadian football game played in the Stadium was the 1950 Mud Bowl for the Grey Cup championship.

During the 1976 Summer Olympics, Varsity Stadium hosted several soccer matches, and was the site of the semi-final game between Brazil and Poland.

The NASL&#x27;s Toronto Metros-Croatia used Varsity Stadium through 1978, before moving to Exhibition Stadium. They returned six years later as the Toronto Blizzard and again made it their home for the 1984 season. On October 3, 1984, before 16,842 fans, the last game ever contested in the original North American Soccer League was played at Varsity Stadium when the Chicago Sting defeated the Blizzard 3–2 to win the deciding game of 1984 Soccer Bowl Series. The NASL would fold before the start of the next season.

In mid-1986, Varsity Stadium played host to the World Lacrosse Championships, a tournament featuring the United States, Canada, England, and Australia. The US defeated Canada in the final, 18–9.

The new Toronto Blizzard returned to Varsity in 1987 as part of the Canadian Soccer League but would move to the smaller Centennial Park Stadium as a cost-cutting move. They returned in 1993 as a member of the American Professional Soccer League but again were forced to move, this time to Lamport Stadium, again due to financial difficulties. Varsity Stadium continued to host the Canadian intercollegiate championship, the Vanier Cup (as it had been for most years from 1965 to 1988 [with exception of 1973–75]), but that too moved to larger quarters such as SkyDome (now known as Rogers Centre) as the popularity of the collegiate championship grew.

Canada&#x27;s national soccer team played several matches at Varsity Stadium, including crucial World Cup qualifying matches versus Costa Rica in 1985 and Mexico in 1993. Friendly matches versus Germany and the Netherlands were also staged in 1994.

Minor league professional soccer team Toronto Lynx moved into the stadium in 1997 but was forced to move to Centennial Park Stadium due to the impending demolition of the historic facility.

The stadium was demolished mid-2002 after the cost of maintaining the large facility was far more than it generated in revenue. At that time, several structural sections of the stadium were being held up by temporary repairs, and the future integrity of the structure was in question. The field and track were retained after the demolition. During the demolition and re-building of the site Toronto Varsity Blues relocated to Birchmount Stadium in Scarborough.

===Second stadium===

From 2003 through 2005, temporary seating of about 1,500 was installed to permit the use of the field for intercollegiate games. The name Varsity Field was used from 2002 to 2006 during the period when the old stadium was demolished and the new stadium was being built.

A plan to build a new 25,000 seat multi-purpose stadium on the site in 2005 was voted down by the governing council of the University of Toronto due to concerns over its cost. The facility was then planned to be built on the grounds of York University but that too failed. At the time of its demolition, Varsity Stadium was the second largest capacity stadium in Canada with a grass field, after Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta (however, that stadium has since switched to an artificial playing surface). The stadium opened in 2007.

Facilities and features built in the first phase of the stadium&#x27;s reconstruction include an IAAF Class II 400m eight-lane track, artificial field turf (FIFA 2 Star rated surface by Polytan), and a winter bubble enabling use during inclement weather. The multi-use capability was one of the main reasons that the plan was passed by the governing council, as opposed to the 25,000-seat stadium. Compared to the old Varsity Stadium, the seating is closer to Varsity Arena, almost making the two structures one conjoined complex. Part of the red brick wall along Bloor Street was maintained for historic purposes, but the new facility is much more open and visible from the streets overall. The new facilities are designed by Diamond and Schmitt Architects.

Following the renovation, the Argonauts returned to the stadium, hosting their 2013 preseason game at their former home. Their 2014 and 2015 preseason home games were also scheduled for the stadium.

For the 2015 Pan American Games the facility hosted archery between July 14 and 18. During the games, the facility was configured to hold roughly 2,000 spectators per session. The facility also hosted the archery events of the 2015 Parapan American Games

==Major events==

In addition to hosting several University of Toronto athletic programs, the stadium has also hosted several events including military, musical, and sporting games.

===Music===
The stadium has also been host to several concerts most notably the 1969 Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; once called the second most important event in rock &amp; roll history. This concert led to the production of a documentary, &quot;Sweet Toronto&quot;, as well as John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Live Peace In Toronto&quot; album. Performers included: The Doors, Plastic Ono Band, Bo Diddley, Chicago Transit Authority (later renamed &quot;Chicago&quot;), Tony Joe White, Alice Cooper, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Cat Mother &amp; the All Night Newsboys, Gene Vincent, Junior Walker &amp; the All Stars, Little Richard, Doug Kershaw, Screaming Lord Sutch, Nucleus, Milkwood, and Whiskey Howl.

Kiss performed at the stadium during their Destroyer Tour on September 6, 1976. Rush performed at the stadium on September 2, 1979, during their Permanent Waves Warm-up Tour.

<doc id="1299072" wikidata="Q4307154" url="?curid=1299072" title="Meta-reference">
<text>Meta-reference (or metareference) is a category of self-references occurring in many media or media artifacts like published texts/documents, films, paintings, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artifact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a &quot;meta-level&quot;) within any given artifact, and draw attention to—or invite reflection about—media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artifact, specific other artifacts (as in parody), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient&#x27;s awareness of an artifact&#x27;s medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of self-reference. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn &quot;becomes conscious of both the medial (or &quot;fictional&quot; in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, &quot;invented&quot;) status of the work&quot; as well as &quot;the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media.&quot; Although certain devices, such as mise-en-abîme, may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily meta-referential themselves. However, innately meta-referential devices (e.g. metalepsis) constitute a category of meta-references.

While meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer&#x27;s invocation of the muses at the beginning of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new. Earlier discussions of meta-referential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass&#x27;s and Robert Scholes&#x27;s exploration of metafiction, Victor Stoichita&#x27;s examination of early modern meta-painting, and Lionel Abel&#x27;s investigation of metatheatre. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the fourth wall. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge meta-reference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al. Publications by Nöth and Bishara as well as Wolf followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.

== Examples ==
While every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect. Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarities, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements. Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.

=== Literature ===
John Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; with the wordsThis &quot;story&quot; I am &quot;telling&quot; is all &quot;imagination&quot;. These &quot;characters&quot; I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my &quot;characters&quot;&#x27; mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am &quot;writing&quot; in [...] a &quot;convention&quot; universally accepted at the time of my &quot;story&quot;: that the &quot;novelist&quot; stands next to God. [emphases added]This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.

In American comic books published by Marvel Comics, the character Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character. He commonly breaks the fourth wall, to humorous effect. To other non-aware characters in the story, Deadpool&#x27;s self-awareness as a comic book character appears to be a form of psychosis. When other characters question whether Deadpool&#x27;s real name is even Wade Wilson, he jokes that his true identity depends on which writer the reader prefers.

=== Film ===
&quot;The Truman Show&quot; is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman&#x27;s life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman&#x27;s life as well as the film itself.

Other examples include films by Mel Brooks, such as &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, which becomes a story about the production of the film, and &quot;Silent Movie&quot; is a silent movie about producing a silent movie. Additionally, &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; and its sequels frequently showed characters referring to the movie script to see what should happen next.

=== Painting ===
An example of meta-reference in painting is &quot;Manet&#x27;s Balcony&quot; by René Magritte. It comments on another painting, &quot;The Balcony&quot; by Édouard Manet, by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient&#x27;s attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still &quot;alive&quot; in the representation, but arguably also that the artist (Manet) and the impressionist painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the impressionist painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way.

<doc id="1299102" wikidata="Q17164798" url="?curid=1299102" title="Household debt">
<text>Household debt is the combined debt of all people in a household, including consumer debt and mortgage loans. A significant rise in the level of this debt coincides historically with many severe economic crises and was a cause of the U.S. and subsequent European economic crises of 2007–2012. Several economists have argued that lowering this debt is essential to economic recovery in the U.S. and selected Eurozone countries.

==Overview==
Household debt can be defined in several ways, based on what types of debt are included. Common debt types include home mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans, student loans, and credit cards. Household debt can also be measured across an economy, to measure how indebted households are relative to various measures of income (e.g., pre-tax and disposable income) or relative to the size of the economy (GDP).

The burden of debt can also be measured in terms of the amount of interest it generates relative to the income of the borrower. For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve measures the &quot;household debt service ratio&quot; (DSR), an estimate of the ratio of debt payments to disposable personal income. Debt payments consist of the estimated required payments on outstanding mortgage and consumer debt. The Fed also measures the &quot;financial obligations ratio&quot; (FOR), which adds automobile lease payments, rental payments on tenant-occupied property, homeowners&#x27; insurance, and property tax payments to the debt service ratio. Homeowner and renter FORs are calculated by applying homeowner and renter shares of payments and income derived from the Survey of Consumer Finances and Current Population Survey to the numerator and denominator of the FOR. The homeowner mortgage FOR includes payments on mortgage debt, homeowners&#x27; insurance, and property taxes, while the homeowner consumer FOR includes payments on consumer debt and automobile leases.

==Historical perspective==
In the 20th century, spending on consumer durables rose significantly. Household debt rose as living standards rose, and consumers demanded an array of durable goods. These included major durables like high-end electronics, vehicles, and appliances, that were purchased with credit. Easy credit encouraged a shift from saving to spending. This trend has continued into the 2020s where swiping a credit card has become a standard in day-to-day life 

Households in developed countries significantly increased their household debt relative to their disposable income and GDP from 1980 to 2007 — one of the many factors behind the U.S. and European crises of 2007–2012. Research indicates that U.S. household debt increased from 43% to 62% of GDP from 1982 to 2000. Looking at the early years of the 21st century, many industrialized countries, with a notable exception of Germany, experienced a major spike of household debt versus GDP around 2007–8, with the United States leading up to 2007; by 2017, the American ratio was second only to that of the United Kingdom.

U.S. households made significant progress in deleveraging (reducing debt) post-crisis, much of it due to foreclosures and financial institution debt write-downs. By some measures, consumers began to add certain types of debt again in 2012, a sign that the economy may be improving as this borrowing supports consumption. However according to a business insider report Where the average American is almost 105,000 dollars in debt and in total Americans have towered over 17.6 trillion dollars of debt which is over double what the U.S government spent in 2022.

==Global economic impact==
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported in April 2012:

&quot;Household debt soared in the years leading up to the Great Recession. In advanced economies, during the five years preceding 2007, the ratio of household debt to income rose by an average of 39 percentage points, to 138 percent. In Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, debt peaked at more than 200 percent of household income. A surge in household debt to historic highs also occurred in emerging economies such as Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania. This occurred largely because the central banks implemented a prolonged period of artificially low policy interest rates, temporarily increasing the amount of debt that could be serviced with a given income. The leveraging up fueled a consumption boom that, ironically, boosted GDP in the countries in question, but represented not a sustainable &#x27;boost to aggregate demand&#x27; but instead a mere pulling forward of consumption, as people took on new 30-40 year debt to pay for current year expenditures.

The predictable fallout of this policy is the slow growth that these countries are experiencing today. At the time, the concurrent boom in both house prices and the stock market - as the prices of financed and financial assets were bid up by virtue of the same low rates - meant that household debt relative to assets held broadly stable, which masked households&#x27; growing exposure to the eventual sharp fall in asset prices. House prices in particular were vulnerable to sharp movements in policy rates in countries in which most mortgages are adjustable-rate, as 30-40 year loans are highly rate sensitive, house purchases are financed at 80-95% of the price, and only 4-5% of homes change owners in a year.

Despite this low volume, the appraisal rules in most countries limit the number of times that a sale can serve as a comp only in terms of time (12 months), not the number of times that a given sale can be used as a comp - because of this, a &quot;cash out refi boom&quot; followed the low-rate-driven-price-increase - this was the primary vehicle through which developed countries&#x27; households leveraged up. On the supply side, home builders are also financed at short rates (in the US, Prime). Their cost of capital was effectively cut in half by virtue of the central bank rate cuts, enabling them to overbuild in response to the rise in prices - with all the new supply making the eventual price collapse worse than it would otherwise have been.

In short, the entire episode was straight out of Ludwig von Mises&#x27; &#x27;Human Action&#x27;, Chapter 20, with the new twist that most of the debt was incurred on the consumer side. When rising consumer prices forced the central banks to allow policy rates to rise back up toward market rates, the wind propping up house prices was taken away. House prices immediately declined, ushering in the global financial crisis. Many households, who had reduced their savings out of a belief in the &quot;wealth effect,&quot; saw their wealth shrink relative to their debt, and, with less income and more unemployment, especially in the previously booming real estate sector, found it harder to meet mortgage payments. &quot;Strategic defaults&quot; became common, as homeowners with significant negative equity simply abandoned the home and the debt.

By the end of 2011, real house prices had fallen from their peak by about 41% in Ireland, 29% in Iceland, 23% in Spain and the United States, and 21% in Denmark. Household defaults, underwater mortgages (where the loan balance exceeds the house value), foreclosures, and fire sales became endemic to a number of economies. Household deleveraging by paying off debts or defaulting on them has begun in some countries. It has been most pronounced in the United States, where about two-thirds of the debt reduction reflects defaults.

Of note, Germany, in which almost all mortgages carry 10 year pricing, and in which the 10 year interest rate did not decline during the 2000s, no housing bubble occurred at all. Also, in Canada, in which most mortgages are ARMs but 3-5 year, and which experienced a muted drop in intermediate-term rates, the housing bubble was more muted than in neighboring US.

==Statistics==

Among OECD countries, the larger share of all household debt is represented by mortgages, the incidence of which varies across countries, between 60% and 90% of total household debt.

===United States===


U.S. household (HH) debt (measured by the FRED variable &quot;CMDEBT&quot;) rose relative to both GDP and disposable income over the 1980 to 2011 period. 
*Household debt as a % disposable income rose from 68% in 1980 to a peak of 128% in 2007, prior to dropping to 112% by 2011.
*Household debt as a % nominal GDP rose from 47% in 1980 to a peak of 94% in 2009, prior to dropping to 77% in 2012.
*U.S. household debt rose from nearly zero in the 1950s to $13.8 trillion in 2008, before declining to $12.9 trillion by Q2 2012.

Consumer credit outstanding includes credit cards, auto loans, student loans, and other types of household debt, but excludes mortgages. It rose from 14.0% GDP in January 1990 to 18.0% GDP by January 2009. It fell to a trough of 16.4% GDP in July 2010 and was back up to 17.5% GDP by January 2013.

==In United States==
===Contribution to the 2008 financial crisis===
This increase in debt from 1980 to 2007 enabled spending that stimulated the economy, arguably &quot;papering over&quot; or hiding the sustainable economic growth rate excluding this increase in leverage. This debt overhang then began holding back the economy as consumers paid down debt (which reduces economic activity) rather than spending.

Paul Krugman wrote in December 2010: &quot;The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble. Twenty years ago, the average American household’s debt was 83 percent of its income; by a decade ago, that had crept up to 92 percent; but by late 2007, debts were 130 percent of income. All this borrowing took place both because banks had abandoned any notion of sound lending and because everyone assumed that house prices would never fall. And then the bubble burst. What we’ve been dealing with ever since is a painful process of &#x27;deleveraging&#x27;: highly indebted Americans not only can&#x27;t spend the way they used to, they&#x27;re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what&#x27;s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more—and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained: we&#x27;re not talking about a brief burst of aid; we’re talking about spending that lasts long enough for households to get their debts back under control. The original Obama stimulus wasn’t just too small; it was also much too short-lived, with much of the positive effect already gone.&quot;

In April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen discussed the situation: &quot;Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging [paying down debt] has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.&quot;

The policy prescription of Ms Yellen&#x27;s predecessor Mr Bernanke was to increase the money supply and artificially reduce interest rates. This stoked another debt and asset bubble. Mr Krugman&#x27;s policy was to ensure that such borrowing took place at the federal government level, to be repaid via taxes on the individuals who he admitted were already overburdened with their own debts. These policies were arguably a mere return to the policies that inflated the debt bubble in the first place.

Economists Atif Mian and Amir Sufi wrote in 2014 that:
*Historically, severe economic downturns are almost always preceded by a sharp increase in household debt.
*U.S. household spending declines were largest in geographic areas with a combination of higher household debt and larger price declines.
*When housing prices fall, poorer homeowners (with a larger proportion of their net worth in their home) are hit the hardest financially and reduce their consumption relatively more than wealthier households.
*Declines in residential investment preceded the recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then non-residential business investment as the recession worsened.

===Effects on economic growth===
Ezra Klein wrote in August 2011: &quot;[W]hat distinguishes crises like this one from typical recessions is household debt. When the financial markets collapsed, household debt was nearly 100 percent of GDP. It’s now down to 90 percent. In 1982, which was the last time we had a big recession, the household-debt-to-GDP ratio was about 45 percent. That means that in this crisis, indebted households can’t spend, which means businesses can’t spend, which means that unless government steps into the breach in a massive way or until households work through their debt burden, we can’t recover. In the 1982 recession, households could spend, and so when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and made spending attractive, we accelerated out of the recession. The utility of calling this downturn a “household-debt crisis” is it tells you where to put your focus: you either need to make consumers better able to pay their debts, which you can do through conventional stimulus policy like tax cuts and jobs programs, or you need to make their debts smaller so they&#x27;re better able to pay them, which you can do by forgiving some of their debt through policies like [mortgage principal reduction] or eroding the value of their debt by increasing inflation. I’ve heard various economist make various smart points about why we should prefer one approach or the other, and it also happens to be the case that the two policies support each other and so we don&#x27;t actually need to choose between them. All of these solutions, of course, have drawbacks: if you put the government deeper into debt in order to help households now, you increase the risk of a public-debt crisis later. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s wise to pair further short-term stimulus with a large amount of long-term deficit reduction. If you force banks to swallow losses or face inflation now, you need to worry about whether they&#x27;ll be able to keep lending at a pace that will support recovery over the next few years. But as we’re seeing, not doing enough isn&#x27;t a safe strategy, either.&quot;

Economist Amir Sufi at the University of Chicago argued in July 2011 that a high level of household debt was holding back the U.S. economy. Households focused on paying down private debt are not able to consume at historical levels. He advocates mortgage write-downs and other debt-related solutions to re-invigorate the economy when household debt levels are exceptionally high. Several European countries also had high household debt levels relative to historical averages leading up to the European sovereign-debt crisis. Recent research also supports the view that excessive household leverage has contributed to the weakness in consumption.

===Effects on employment===
Rana Foroohar wrote in July 2012: &quot;[R]esearch shows that the majority of job losses in the U.S. since the Great Recession were due to lower consumer spending because of household debt, a decline that resulted in layoffs at U.S. firms. Parting back debt is the precursor to greater spending and greater growth.&quot;

===Effects on economic recovery===
Neil Irwin explained the economic effects of rising consumer credit outstanding (i.e., all types of household debt other than mortgages) in July 2013: &quot;Americans are finally feeling more confident about the economy and thus willing to take on debt. Lenders, meanwhile, are growing more comfortable extending loans. The spending enabled by this rising consumer debt can help create a virtuous cycle in which more demand for goods and services creates more jobs, which creates rising income. Indeed, more borrowing by households (and the spending that results) is likely offsetting some of the pain caused by federal spending cuts and deficit reduction.&quot;

==Reducing household debt==
Household debt can be challenging to reduce. Major approaches include:

* Paying down debt over time from income or accumulated savings, if available
* Debt write-down or refinancing via negotiation, bankruptcy or government bailout
* Inflation, although if wage increases do not exceed inflation, this approach is mostly academic

===Paying off debt from income or savings===
Since most middle income households have the majority of their wealth invested in their home, paying down debt from income can take a decade or longer when a housing bubble bursts, as it did for much of the developed world in 2007–2012. For example, this debt accumulated over a 30-year period (1980–2007 peak) in the U.S. and much of the increase was mortgage-related.

===Debt restructuring or write-down===
Debt can sometimes be reduced by negotiation with creditors or by a legal bankruptcy process, which can result in dismissal of certain types of debt such as credit cards. Some lenders may agree to write down mortgage values (reducing the homeowner&#x27;s obligation) rather than taking even larger losses in foreclosure. Economist Joseph Stiglitz argued for a rapid bankruptcy process for homeowners, to allow debts to be written down.

Economists Joseph Stiglitz and Mark Zandi both advocated significant mortgage refinancing or write-downs in August 2012. They explained that more than four million Americans lost their homes since the housing bubble began bursting in 2006. An additional 3.5 million homeowners are in the foreclosure process or are so delinquent on payments that they will be soon. Roughly 13.5 million homeowners are underwater (in negative equity), meaning they owe more than their home is now worth, increasing the odds that millions more will lose their homes. The household debt and foreclosures are significantly holding back the economy.

Economists Kenneth S. Rogoff and Carmen M. Reinhart wrote in April 2013: &quot;In the United States, we support reducing mortgage principal on homes that are underwater (where the mortgage is higher than the value of the home). We have also written about plausible solutions that involve moderately higher inflation and “financial repression” — pushing down inflation-adjusted interest rates, which effectively amounts to a tax on bondholders. This strategy contributed to the significant debt reductions that followed World War II.

Professor Luigi Zingales (University of Chicago) advocated a mortgage debt for equity swap in July 2009, where the mortgage debt would be written down in exchange for the bank taking an interest in future appreciation of the home upon sale (a debt-for-equity swap). Fund Manager John Hussman also advocated debt-for-equity swaps for households and banks during April 2009.

Journalist Steven Clemons wrote in July 2012: &quot;The Great Recession of 2008–2009, from which there are still repercussions in the US and global economies, resulted from a massive surge in consumer loans—98% in just five years—and ... the combined total of US business and consumer loans is basically at the same level as at the moment this crisis hit.&quot; He argued for debt forgiveness or restructuring to help stimulate the economy.

During the Great Depression, the U.S. created the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), which acquired and refinanced one million delinquent mortgages between 1933 and 1936.

===Inflation===
If wages increase due to inflation, but debts remain fixed, the debts can be more easily repaid. Economists may advocate increasing inflation to help reduce the debt burden in highly leveraged economies. For example, economist Kenneth Rogoff has advocated both mortgage write-downs and inflation during August 2011: &quot;I argued that the only practical way to shorten the coming period of painful deleveraging and slow growth would be a sustained burst of moderate inflation, say, 4–6% for several years. Of course, inflation is an unfair and arbitrary transfer of income from savers to debtors. But, at the end of the day, such a transfer is the most direct approach to faster recovery. Eventually, it will take place one way or another, anyway, as Europe is painfully learning.&quot; He also suggested that the government could take an equity interest in the homes in exchange for paying down the mortgages.

== Household over-indebtedness ==
While it is challenging to define over-indebtedness, definitions of over-indebtedness tend to have a few core elements in common. The first one refers to the capacity to meet the expenses associated with the contracted financial commitments. Over-indebtedness implies an inability to meet such recurring expenses. Second, this inability is structural. This is the time dimension, which holds that the definition must capture persistent and ongoing financial problems and exclude one-off occurrences that arise due to forgetfulness, for instance. The third core element refers to standard of living. The household must be unable to meet contracted commitments without reducing its minimum standard of living expenses. Fourth, comes illiquidity. The household is unable to remedy the situation by recourse to (financial and non-financial) assets and other financial sources such as credit. Lastly, all contracted financial commitments are included, among them mortgage and consumer credit commitments, utility and telephone bills as well as rent payments (recurring expenses).

Causes of over-indebtedness can be diverse. A &#x27;risky life event&#x27; (for example, unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, business failure, illness or unexpected home repairs. Such events can trigger income and expenditure shocks) can lie at the root, sometimes instantly turning indebtedness into over-indebtedness. Other households have unconsciously, or consciously, gradually become
over-committed. They make use of available forms of credit, sometimes without realizing that they might not be able to repay in the future. Lack of financial management skills and aggressive marketing by lenders may both lie at the origin of this. Another potential cause includes escalating consumption habits. The third group of people are the least well-off. They need to obtain credit in order to attain a reasonable standard of living. They are frequently subject to relatively high interest rates. Potential consequences for the over-indebted household include financial hardship, depression, poor health, relationship breakdown, exclusion from basic financial services, a strain on social relations, absenteeism at work and lack of organizational commitment, a feeling of insecurity.

Responses to household over-indebtedness can be preventive, alleviative and rehabilitative. Preventive measures include financial education and regulation. An example of the last is the European Union&#x27;s &quot;Directive on Credit Agreements for Consumers Household debt advisory services&quot;. It stipulates, for example, that lenders should list the interest rates they change in a homogenized way (yearly rates) and that paper contracts should be signed for debts above a certain amounts, thus inhibiting for example impulsive borrowing through SMS-loans. Alleviative measures include debt advisory services, which aim to help households getting their finances back on track, mainly by means of information provision, budget planning and balancing, help with legal arrangements, negotiation with creditors, providing psychological support by having someone to talk to, and even by effectively, voluntarily taking over the managing of a household&#x27;s finances. Rehabilitative measures include consumer bankruptcy and legal debt settlement procedures. While precise arrangements vary largely between countries, in general such procedures work as follows. During such procedures, the over-indebted household hands over all income above a minimum threshold to the creditors/state and is cleared of its debts after the period, varying in length from for example 1 year in the UK to 5 in Portugal and 12 in Ireland.
