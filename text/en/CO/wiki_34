== History ==
===Beginnings===

The organization grew out of the surgical practice of Frank J. Weed (died 1891) at 16 Church Street on the near-west side of Cleveland. The practice was purchased by his two assistants, Frank E. Bunts and George Washington Crile. In 1892 they were joined by Crile&#x27;s cousin, William E. Lower, and in 1897 the practice moved to the Osborn Building on Prospect Avenue, downtown Cleveland.
A four-story outpatient building was constructed, and Cleveland Clinic was dedicated at a private ceremony on February 26, 1921. It opened its doors two days later to the public and registered 42 patients. By April 1921, it had 60 employees, including 14 physicians and four nurses. In 1922 the founders purchased four private homes nearby for hospitalization, radiation treatment, and administration. A fifth house was acquired as a residence for patients with diabetes receiving insulin treatments. To meet rising patient volume, a 184-bed hospital was built in 1924, located at East 90th Street and Carnegie Avenue. A power plant, laundry, and ice plant were also built. A research laboratory was constructed in 1928.

===Cleveland Clinic fire===
On May 15, 1929, nitrocellulose x-ray films stored in the basement of the outpatient building ignited. An explosion sent a cloud of toxic oxides of nitrogen and carbon though the building. One hundred and twenty-three people, including John Phillips, one of the founders, lost their lives. A dozen investigating agencies were not able to determine what had caused the fire. Cleveland Clinic&#x27;s own inquiry narrowed the possible causes down to spontaneous combustion caused by heat; a discarded cigarette or match; and contact with an extension cord light hung over a stack of films.

Philanthropist Samuel Mather formed a committee of 36 community leaders to help Cleveland Clinic reestablish itself in temporary quarters across the street. Patient care services resumed five days later. The 1921 building was completely renovated, and a new three-story clinic building, with a new main entrance, was added in 1931. All debts were repaid by 1941.

===Growth of specialization===

Cleveland Clinic built new operating rooms in the early 1970s to accommodate the growth of cardiac surgery. The Martha Holden Jennings Education Building opened in 1964, with an auditorium named for Dr. Bunts. A new hospital building (currently home to Cleveland Clinic Children&#x27;s Hospital) opened in 1966, and a research building opened in 1974 (demolished in 2007). A pathology and laboratory medicine building was constructed on Carnegie Avenue in 1980.

Willian S. Kiser, chairman of the board 1977–1989, led the development of a strategic plan to accommodate growing patient volumes in the late 1970s. This resulted in a group of buildings known as the Century Project. Completed in 1985, the Century Project includes a 14-story outpatient building (now known as the Crile Building) designed by architect Cesar Pelli.

In September 2014, the Cleveland Clinic opened the center for Functional Medicine, directed by Mark Hyman.

== Research and education ==

The Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute (LRI) conducts biomedical research in a 480,000-square-foot building that opened in 1999, following a $16 million donation from Al and Norma Lerner in 1997, the largest single charitable donation made to the Cleveland Clinic up until that point. LRI hosts graduate student research through joint PhD programs in conjunction with nearby universities, including Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University (including an NIH-funded PhD program for minority and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), Kent State University and the University of Akron.

In 2002, the Lerners eclipsed their previous gift and made a $100 million donation to establish the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM) within Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, opening in 2004. Physician researcher Eric Topol played an important role in securing the donation from the Lerner family. Topol served as Provost and Chief Academic Officer at CCLCM until 2006, when his position was eliminated amid controversy regarding his criticism of Vioxx and disagreements with other Cleveland Clinic leaders, including then-CEO Toby Cosgrove. CCLCM is a five-year medical school program affiliated with the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine with 32 students per class, each receiving a scholarship for full tuition and fees. While traditional MD-granting medical schools in the U.S. are four-year programs, the extra year in the program is dedicated to a year of research. The curriculum is notable for its lack of class rank, pre-clinical or clinical grading, or end-of-course examinations.

In 2019, Cleveland Clinic and Case Western opened the Samson Pavilion Health Education Campus on the campus of the Cleveland Clinic, a $515 million building project, amid a multi-million dollar joint fundraising campaign between CWRU and the Cleveland Clinic. The campus houses students Case Western Reserve School of Medicine (CCLCM and traditional MD programs), Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing and Case School of Dental Medicine, all of which—with the exception of CCLCM—had previously held classes on the campus of CWRU and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. The move, announced in 2013, was a major contributing factor for University Hospitals to shift its name from University Hospitals Case Medical Center to University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in 2016, as well as renegotiate its affiliation agreement with CWRU that same year.

Cleveland Clinic publishes the peer-reviewed &quot;Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine&quot; monthly, focusing on internal medicine, endocrinology, and diabetes.

== Reputation ==
Cleveland Clinic is consistently regarded as one of the top hospital systems in the United States and in the world, and it is well regarded particularly in technological management systems.

=== Rankings ===
In 2020–2021, Cleveland Clinic was ranked as the #2 overall hospital in the United States by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, behind the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. A total of 4,656 hospitals were considered in 12 main data-driven medical and surgical specialty areas and four additional specialty areas, collating data on patient safety, performance measures, and complication rates. Cleveland Clinic was found to be nationally ranked in 14 adult specialties and 10 children&#x27;s specialties and was recognized as the #1 hospital in Ohio and in the Cleveland Metropolitan Area. It also achieved the highest rating possible in 9 specified procedures or conditions: abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, aortic valve surgery, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colon cancer surgery, heart bypass surgery, heart failure, hip replacement, knee replacement, and lung cancer surgery. In addition, for the 14th year in a row, Cleveland Clinic was ranked as the #1 hospital in the United States for cardiology and heart surgery as a specialty. Similarly, in 2021, &quot;Newsweek&quot; named Cleveland Clinic the number 2 hospital in the world, behind Mayo Clinic.

In 2021, Gartner ranked Cleveland Clinic as the #1 healthcare supply chain.

In 2022, The American Hospital Association (AHA) partnered with the Society for Healthcare Strategy and Market Development to engage the branding agency, Monigle, to conduct consumer research with 28,000 Americans to rank hospital brands °… on their performance in delivering a humanized experience&quot;. The Cleveland Clinic was ranked first, followed by two other Ohio systems. Other systems, including Johns Hopkins ranked 6th; Mass General, 11th; and the Mayo Clinic ranked 15h.

===Safety===

In a Kaiser Family Foundation review of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data for hospital acquired conditions in 2014, Cleveland Clinic received an 8.7 score (1–10 possible, with 10 being the worst), in the bottom 7% of hospitals.

Between 2010 and 2013, CMS undertook an extensive series of investigations into the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, with at least a dozen inspections and follow-up visits triggered by patient complaints. An analysis of Medicare inspection data between 2011 and 2014 found that the Cleveland Clinic Foundation was one of at least 230 instances in which validated serious incidents—dubbed &quot;immediate jeopardy&quot; complaints—led CMS to threaten loss of ability to serve Medicare patients unless the problems were fixed immediately. Due to numerous serious ongoing safety violations, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation was on payment termination track for 19 months, placing at stake $1B in annual Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement. The citations were reported and analyzed in detail by &quot;Modern Healthcare&quot;, which posted some of the safety documents.

In its 2020 Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings, CMS gave a five-star rating to the Cleveland Clinic, as well as several community hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic system, including Fairview Hospital, Hillcrest Hospital, and Lutheran Hospital. In these ratings, Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital received a one-star rating.

During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, administration at the Cleveland Clinic initially instructed employees that they were not allowed to wear face masks outside of patient care areas. The Cleveland Clinic stated they made this decision as they felt the current body of evidence at the time did not support their use. Other hospitals however require such masks. Later, with growing evidence of mask efficacy, this policy were revised and all staff members were required to wear cloth or protective masks. Masks were obtained from a variety of sources, including Amish and sports apparel manufacturers, among other suppliers.

In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cleveland Clinic permitted its staff to be unvaccinated against COVID.

== Locations ==

Cleveland Clinic operates 19 family health and ambulatory surgery centers in surrounding communities, a 1,000 bed multispecialty hospital and family health center in Weston, Florida, and two Cleveland Clinic Canada locations in Toronto, Canada. The system operates 11 affiliated hospitals in northeast Ohio, numbering 2,588 total beds. Additionally Cleveland Clinic operates five affiliated hospitals in Florida with 289 total beds, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi with 564 total beds, and London, United Kingdom with 185 total beds; for a grand total of 6,026 beds.

Cleveland Clinic&#x27;s main campus consists of 60 buildings on near University Circle, in Fairfax, Cleveland.

In 1996, the Cleveland Clinic took over Fairview Health System centered on Fairview Hospital and serving the West Side of Cleveland and the western suburbs. In the same year, the Cleveland Clinic also took over the four-hospital Meridia Health System, absorbing Euclid Hospital in Euclid, Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Huron Hospital in East Cleveland, and South Pointe Hospital in Warrensville Heights. In October 2010, the Cleveland Clinic announced plans to close the Level II Trauma Center at Huron Hospital, prompting a joint lawsuit from the cities of Cleveland and East Cleveland, which was later dropped after the Clinic delayed closure plans. In 2011, amid criticism from residents and leaders in East Cleveland, the Clinic closed Huron Hospital, replacing it with a community health center and leaving the east side of Cleveland without a trauma center until University Hospitals opened a Level I trauma center in 2015. In May 2017 Cleveland Clinic reached an agreement to acquire the 150-bed Union Hospital in Dover, Ohio. In February 2021, Mercy Medical Center in Canton, Ohio became a full member of the Cleveland Clinic health system, while retaining its Catholic affiliation through sponsorship with the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine.

<text>River 94.9 (callsign: 4MIX) is a commercial radio station that broadcasts to South East Queensland. The station opened in February 1990, and was formerly known as Star 106.9, which used to operate on the frequency now occupied by Nova 106.9. The station was previously owned by Rural Press &amp; Bundaberg Broadcasters, forming part of the Star Broadcasting Network, followed by Grant Broadcasters.

==History==

===As QFM===
From its launch until 1997, QFM broadcast contemporary hit music format.

===As Star 106.9===
In 1997, QFM rebranded as Star 106.9, dropping a CHR format for a classic hits format.

Prior to the switch to 94.9, Star&#x27;s callsign was changed from 4QFM to 4MIX, supposedly to block Australian Radio Network station 97.3fm from using the Mix positioner used by its sister stations.

===As River 94.9===
In 2001, Star FM upgraded their transmitter and moved to 94.9 MHz in order to better broadcast into Brisbane, avoiding interference of two other very strong signals – ABC Classic FM on 106.1 and triple j on 107.7. The move to 94.9 eliminated that problem, and, on the flipside, means the station has equal to better reach than the Brisbane radio stations towards the west and Toowoomba, with a large volume of advertisements for companies and stores in those regions. As part of the change, the station took on an adult variety format.&#x27;Wild Nights&#x27;, a dance music format licensed from Central Station Records based on community radio station Wild FM was added to the late night programming from the end of January 2001.

Despite broadcasting into part of the Brisbane area, the station is not officially counted in Brisbane ratings surveys, however 2017 saw the first ever Ipswich radio survey where River 94.9 dominated (26.4%) 

In 2008, River 94.9 was the official broadcaster for South-East Queensland, of the Macquarie Radio Network&#x27;s Olympic Radio Coverage. It was sold in May of that year to Grant Broadcasters by owners Fairfax Media, due to diversity rules controlled by Australian Communications and Media Authority, which prevents more than 2 licences overlapping into a market owned by the same group.

In November 2021, River 94.9, along with other stations owned by Grant Broadcasters, were acquired by the Australian Radio Network. This deal will allow Grant&#x27;s stations, including River 94.9, to access ARN&#x27;s iHeartRadio platform in regional areas. The deal was finalized on 4 January 2022. To comply with Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority regulations that limit the number of radio stations an owner can have in one city, ARN is forced to sell 4KQ at some point in time.

River 94.9 simulcasts &quot;Nine News Queensland&quot; at 6:00 pm every weekday.

Current programming:

5 am–9 am: Marnie &amp; Campo for Brekky &lt;BR&gt; 
9 am–12 pm: Mornings with Ilija (including 94 minutes non-stop 9 am–10:34 am) &lt;br&gt;
12 pm–3 pm: Afternoons with ail (including “The Flashback lunch ) 
2 pm-6 pm drive home with hinsky 

 
6pm–7pm: Nine News Simulcast with Andrew Lofthouse &amp; Melissa Downes (Sunday to Friday) &lt;BR&gt;
7pm–9pm: 20/20 Retro Countdown with Aaron Stevens

River 94.9 also does “Flashback Friday” going back to the 70s, 80s and 90s every Friday between 9am and 6pm. Also, every weekend they do a different Weekend Music Feature, with a feature all weekend (e.g. 80&#x27;s weekend, or an “ Unflogged Weekend”)

<doc id="1278961" wikidata="Q28193" url="?curid=1278961" title="The New World (2005 film)">
<text>The New World is a 2005 historical romantic drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick, depicting the founding of the Jamestown, Virginia, settlement and inspired by the historical figures Captain John Smith, Pocahontas of the Powhatan tribe, and Englishman John Rolfe. It is the fourth feature film written and directed by Malick.

The cast includes Colin Farrell, Q&#x27;orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, August Schellenberg, Wes Studi, David Thewlis, Yorick van Wageningen and John Savage. The production team includes director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki, producer Sarah Green, production designer Jack Fisk, costume designer Jacqueline West, composer James Horner and film editors Richard Chew, Hank Corwin, Saar Klein and Mark Yoshikawa.

&quot;The New World&quot; was a box-office failure even though it received many award nominations for Lubezki&#x27;s cinematography, Kilcher&#x27;s acting and Horner&#x27;s score. The film was initially met with an only mildly positive critical response, although several critics later ranked it as one of the best films of the decade.

==Plot==

In 1607, Pocahontas, the adventurous daughter of Chief Powhatan, and others from her tribe witness the arrival of three ships sent by English royal charter to found a colony in the New World. Aboard one ship is Captain John Smith, sentenced to death for mutinous remarks, but once ashore pardoned by Captain Christopher Newport, leader of the expedition.

While the settlement&#x27;s prospects are initially bright, disease, poor discipline, supply shortages, and tensions with local Native Americans, whom Newport calls &quot;the naturals&quot;, jeopardize the expedition. Taking a small group upriver to seek trade while Newport returns to England for supplies, Smith is captured by Native Americans and brought before Chief Powhatan. After being questioned, the captain is nearly executed, but Pocahontas intervenes and he is spared.

Living as the Native Americans&#x27; prisoner, Smith is treated well, earning the tribe&#x27;s friendship and respect. Coming to admire this new way of life, he falls deeply in love with Pocahontas, who is intrigued by the Englishman and his ways. The chief returns Smith to Jamestown with the understanding that the English are to leave the following spring, once their boats return.

Smith discovers the settlement in turmoil and is pressed into accepting the governorship, finding the peace he had with the Natives replaced by privation, death, and the difficulties of his new position. Smith wishes to return to Pocahontas but dismisses the idea, thinking of his time among the Native Americans as &quot;a dream&quot;. The settlers dwindle throughout the brutal winter, and are saved only when Pocahontas and a rescue party arrive with food, clothing, and supplies.

As spring arrives, Powhatan realizes that the English do not intend to leave. Discovering his daughter&#x27;s actions, he orders an attack on Jamestown and exiles Pocahontas. Repulsing the attack, the settlers learn of Pocahontas&#x27;s banishment. The English sea captain Samuel Argall, while on a trading expedition up the Potomac River, convinces them to abduct Pocahontas from the Patawomecks as a prisoner in order to negotiate with her father in exchange for captive settlers, but not for their stolen weapons and tools. Opposing this plan, Smith is removed as governor and imprisoned, but renews his love affair after Pocahontas is brought to Jamestown. Captain Newport returns, freeing Smith and telling him of an offer from the king to lead his own expedition to find passage to the East Indies. Torn between his love and his career, Smith decides to return to England. Before departing, he leaves instructions with another settler, who later tells Pocahontas that Smith died in the crossing.

Devastated, Pocahontas sinks into depression. Living in Jamestown, she is eventually comforted by a new settler, John Rolfe, who helps her adapt to the English way of life. She is baptized, educated, and eventually married to Rolfe and gives birth to a son, Thomas. She later learns Captain Smith is still alive, news to which she has a violent reaction; she finds herself rejecting Rolfe and retreats to her loyalty to Smith, thinking fate spared his life and they are to be reunited. Rolfe and his family are given a chance to travel to England. Arriving in London and sharing an audience with the king and queen, Pocahontas is overwhelmed by the wonders of this &quot;New World&quot;.

She meets privately with Smith, who admits he may have made a mistake in choosing his career over Pocahontas. He says that what they experienced in Virginia was not a dream but instead &quot;the only truth&quot;. Asked if he ever found his Indies, he replies, &quot;I may have sailed past them.&quot; They part, never to meet again. Realizing Rolfe is the man she thought he was and more, Pocahontas finally accepts him as her husband and love. The couple make arrangements to return to Virginia, but Pocahontas falls ill and dies near Gravesend. Rolfe still decides to return to Virginia with Thomas.

The film ends with images of the young adult Pocahontas and her young son happily playing in the gardens of their English estate. Rolfe, in a voice-over, reads a letter addressed to their only son about his deceased Native American mother, who is heard to say, &quot;Mother, now I know where you live,&quot; with concluding images of nature in the New World.

==Production==
===Development===
Terrence Malick began work on the script for &quot;The New World&quot; in the late 1970s. After &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, Malick worked on a film about Che Guevara and his failed revolution in Bolivia. When financing had yet to come through, Malick was offered the chance to direct &quot;The New World&quot; and left the Guevara project in March 2004. Production on &quot;The New World&quot; was underway by July of that year.

===Filming===
&quot;The New World&quot; was the first collaboration between Malick and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The film was notable for its emphasis on authenticity, from location, settings and costumes to the casting of Native American actors and extras who were trained by Blair Rudes, professor of linguistics at UNC-Charlotte, to speak a form of the extinct Powhatan language (a type of Virginian Algonquian) reconstructed for the film by Rudes. Some footage was also filmed at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, England. Principal photography wrapped after three and a half months in November 2004.

===Post-production===
The film was originally set to be released in November 2005, but release had to be postponed. Malick was still editing the footage he had shot. He is well known for editing his films up until the last minute, often trimming his films and leaving entire characters out of the final print, as is the case with &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. In early December, a 150-minute version was shown to critics for awards season consideration. It was released for a week from Christmas to New Year&#x27;s Day in two theaters each in Los Angeles and New York to qualify for the Academy Awards.

For the film&#x27;s wide release, which began on January 20, 2006, Malick re-edited the film, cutting it to 135 minutes, but also adding footage not seen in the first release. He altered some of the film&#x27;s extensive voiceovers to clarify the plot. Substantial changes were made to the first half-hour of the picture, seemingly to speed the plot along.

===Music===
The musical score for &quot;The New World&quot; was composed by James Horner. He worked first from the script and then from edited scenes. As the film was re-edited, more changes to the score were required. Because Malick&#x27;s editing was extensive and involved reordering or dropping passages or inserting sequences, much of Horner&#x27;s score was not used. For the final version, Malick used sections of Horner&#x27;s music along with the prelude to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 23, and other pieces. Horner and Glen Ballard wrote and recorded the song &quot;Listen to the Wind&quot;, sung by Hayley Westenra, for the closing credits, but this too was unused.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Despite arresting visuals and strong lead performances, &quot;The New World&quot; suffers from an unfocused narrative that will challenge viewers&#x27; attention spans over its 2 1/2 hours.&quot; Review aggregator Metacritic gave the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four out of four, arguing that &quot;what distinguishes Malick&#x27;s film is how firmly he refuses to know more than he should...The events in his film, including the tragic battles between the Indians and the settlers, seem to be happening for the first time.&quot; He also lauded Malick as a &quot;visionary&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; hailed the film as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, while others such as Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot;, and David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; gave positive reviews.

On the other hand, Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; faulted the film for being &quot;stately almost to the point of being static&quot;, while Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized it as &quot;sluggish&quot;, &quot;underdramatized&quot;, and &quot;emotionally remote&quot;. While its release was timed for consideration for the awards season, it was nominated only for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki at the 78th Academy Awards.

In November 2009, &quot;Time Out New York&quot; ranked the film as the fourth best of the decade, saying, &quot;The particular power of this tone poem comes from how quietly resigned both characters are to their fates, as if they sense a guiding hand in their every action. The final passages of Malick&#x27;s idyll, after Pocahontas takes a fateful ocean journey, are the finest work of his career, most notably in his portrayal of the princess&#x27;s death and transfiguration—a shattering five-minute sequence that never fails to move.&quot; In January 2010, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; designated it the number one film of the decade:Terence Malick&#x27;s one-of-a-kind film, about the life of Pocahontas and the dawn of American history, contains some of the best filmmaking imaginable – some of it beyond imagining. I have seen it at least five times and have no idea how Malick knew, when he put it all together, that the movie would even make sense. It&#x27;s difficult to write a great short poem. It&#x27;s difficult to write a great long novel. But to write a great long poem that&#x27;s the size of a great long novel – one that makes sense, doesn&#x27;t flag and is exponentially better than the short poem or the long novel ever would have been – that&#x27;s almost impossible. Malick did it. With images.The French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; ranked the film as 9th place in its list of best films of the decade 2000–2009. Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz has said it is his favorite film.

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Patterson writes that &quot;The New World&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t have fans, just fanatics&quot;:

This decade hasn&#x27;t been up to much, movie-wise, but I am more than ever convinced that when every other scrap of celluloid from 2000-2009 has crumbled to dust, one film will remain, like some Ozymandias-like remnant of transient vanished glory in the desert. And that film is &quot;The New World&quot;, Terrence Malick&#x27;s American foundation myth, which arrived just as the decade reached its dismal halfway point, in January 2006... &quot;The New World&quot; is a bottomless movie, almost unspeakably beautiful and formally harmonious. The movie came and went within a month, and its critical reception was characterised for the most part by bafflement, condescension, lazy ridicule and outright hostility... Its siblings are to be found throughout movie history and across all national and stylistic boundaries, from the silents to Jean-Luc Godard, James Benning and Stan Brakhage, or in &quot;Winstanley&quot; and &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. Its cultural hinterland is made up not just of other movies, but of Buddhism, ethnography and naturalism, Wagner, Mozart and the structural forms of classical music, Malick&#x27;s enthusiasm for bird-watching, and a helping of Heidegger and Kant... It is both ancient and modern, cinema at its purest and most organic, its simplest and most refined.

In a contribution to &quot;The cinema of Terrence Malick: Poetic visions of America&quot;, film scholar Mark Cousins writes, &quot;By the end of &quot;The New World&quot;, it seemed to me, I had experienced something like a Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot; or a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was about rapture and the end of rapture. It showed me seeing. It made me sensible.&quot;

In a 2016 international critics&#x27; poll conducted by the BBC, &quot;The New World&quot; was voted the 39th-greatest film since 2000.

===Historical accuracy===
Most scholars agree that there was no romantic relationship between Pocahontas and Smith. She would have been 12 years old in 1608 when they were said to have first met. The film also depicts Pocahontas&#x27;s marriage with Rolfe as being more peaceful and socially accepted than it was historically.

A third, 172-minute version, dubbed &quot;The Extended Cut&quot;, was issued by New Line on DVD in October 2008. It contains new scenes and expansions to other scenes. The 135-minute and 172-minute cuts are widely available on DVD worldwide, with the 172-minute cut also released on Blu-ray. The 150-minute version was released commercially only twice—as a Digital Download briefly available to buyers of the US &quot;Extended Cut&quot; DVD in 2008, and on DVD in Italy as part of Italian distributor Eagle Pictures&#x27;s 2-disc set, containing both the 150-minute and 135-minute versions of the film.

On July 26, 2016, all three cuts were released on Blu-ray and DVD in the United States by The Criterion Collection with the 172-minute extended cut from a new 4K digital restoration supervised by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and director Terrence Malick.

<doc id="1278970" wikidata="Q2009646" url="?curid=1278970" title="PFA Young Player of the Year">
<text>The Professional Footballers&#x27; Association Young Player of the Year (often called the PFA Young Player of the Year, or simply the Young Player of the Year) is an annual award given to the young player who is adjudged to have been the best of the season in English football. As of 2021, players must have been aged 21 or under as of 1 July immediately preceding the start of the season; in the past the age limit has been 23, which led to criticism in the media over whether a player who was 24 years old at the end of the season could really be considered &quot;young&quot; in footballing terms. The award has been presented since the 1973–74 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players&#x27; trade union, the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA). The first winner of the award was Ipswich Town defender Kevin Beattie. The current holder is Chelsea player Cole Palmer, who won the award on 20 August 2024.

Although the award is open to players at all levels, all winners to date have played in the highest division of the English football league system. In 2018 Ryan Sessegnon of Fulham became the first player from outside the top division of English football to be nominated for the award. As of 2024, only Ryan Giggs, Robbie Fowler, Wayne Rooney, Dele Alli and Phil Foden have won the award on more than one occasion. Only seven players from outside the United Kingdom have won the trophy, compared with fifteen winners of the main PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award. Although they have their own dedicated award, players aged 21 or under at the start of the season remain eligible to win the Players&#x27; Player of the Year award, and on three occasions the same player has won both awards for a season. 

A shortlist of nominees is published in April and the winner of the award, along with the winners of the PFA&#x27;s other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in London. The players themselves consider the award to be highly prestigious, because the winner is chosen by his fellow professionals.

==Winners==
The award has been presented on 51 occasions as of 2024, to 46 players. The table also indicates where the winning player also won one or more of the other major &quot;player of the year&quot; awards in English football, namely the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award (PPY), the Football Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Footballer of the Year award (FWA), the Premier League Player of the Season award (PPS), the Premier League Young Player of the Season award (PYPS), and the PFA Fans&#x27; Player of the Year award (FPY).

<text>The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) is the undergraduate student government of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. The GUSA bylaws state that the organization&#x27;s mission is &quot;to (i) empower Hoyas by giving them control over resources, (ii) improve the student quality of life, (iii) safeguard Hoya rights, (iv) involve Hoyas in the governance of the University, and (v) ensure that the University conducts itself in an ethical and responsible manner.&quot;

== Structure ==

===Executive Branch===
The Executive Branch is made up of a President and Vice President, elected by the undergraduate student body each November to lead for the following calendar year, as well as a staff whose size and structure is largely up to the discretion of the President and Vice President. Since 2023, the executive staff has been restructured and expanded to address many issues raised by members of the undergraduate student body. Membership on cabinet staff, executive staff, and general staff positions is application-based and open to all undergraduate students. The President and Vice President also appoint student representatives to a variety of external boards and committees, and all executive staff positions and external board appointments are subject to review and confirmation by the Senate.

*Due to a change in election timelines, beginning in 2022 the GUSA Executive serves for a calendar year rather than a school year

===Legislative Branch===
The Legislative Branch is made up of a 29-person Senate which can amend the GUSA bylaws, confirm executive and judicial appointments, and engage in advocacy through mechanisms that include resolutions and ad hoc committees. The Senate is led by a Speaker and Vice Speaker during the academic year and over the summer. The Senate also controls the process by which more than $1 million is allocated to student organizations. The process is overseen by the Senate&#x27;s Finance and Appropriations Committee, which allocates the sum total funds generated by the Student Activities Fee ($164 per student in 2018) each year to five club advisory boards, the Lecture Fund, the Georgetown Programming Board, and other groups.

The April session runs from April to November consisting of 22 representatives before the new incoming Freshmen class holds elections. The November session runs from November to April with all 29 representatives after elections are held for the Freshmen Class and At-Large senate seats. Leadership elections are held the first meeting following each election cycle.

===Judicial Branch===
The Judicial Branch is made up of a 3-person Constitutional Council, which oversees all internal GUSA disputes and is charged with the stewardship of the GUSA Constitution.

==Legacy==
Student government has been involved throughout its history in the establishment, expansion, and improvement of a plethora of student resources and services. This legacy includes the Georgetown University Transportation Shuttles (GUTS) system, which was founded in 1974 and expanded several times since then through the work of student government, and campus dining, whose improvement has been a focus of student government for decades. Other initiatives include:

* The Georgetown University Lecture Fund, which was founded by Student Government in the 1970s and became an independent organization in 2005
*The GeorgetownOne Card (GoCard), in whose 2001 creation GUSA played a pivotal role
* The Collegiate Readership Program, a GUSA initiative which provided students with free copies of major newspapers from 2008 to 2015, and 2023 onwards
* The Summer Fellows program, which was founded by GUSA in 2009 and now provides free on-campus summer housing to low-income students under the auspices of the Georgetown Scholarship Program (GSP)
** Currently known as the Summer BRIDGE Housing Program from 2023 onwards
* The Student Advocacy Office (SAO), which was founded by GUSA in 2012 and continues to provide assistance to students navigating the university&#x27;s disciplinary systems
* The Georgetown University Farmer&#x27;s Market, which was organized by GUSA in 2018 and continues under its own board every Wednesday during the school year
* The Georgetown Student Mental Health Fund, which was organized by GUSA in 2018 with an initial contribution from GUSA, the Student Affairs Office, and an anonymous donor, helps fund students who are referred to off campus specialists from the Counseling and Psychiatry Services, ongoing funding is being supported by the Division of Student Affairs
* The Georgetown Disability Cultural Initiative, which welcomed its first Associate Director, Dr. Amy Kenny, in the summer of 2022 and later became the Disability Cultural Center in Fall 2023
* Other notable groups that the Georgetown University Student Association has founded over its duration include:
** Students Advocating for Food Equity (SAFE)
** The Georgetown University Coalition for Worker&#x27;s Rights (GUCWR)
** Inter-Academic Council (InterAC)
** The Hoya Hub
Perhaps the most famous service established by student government is Students of Georgetown, Inc., also known as &quot;The Corp&quot;, which was founded by SG President Roger Cochetti and Vice President Nancy Kent in October 1971. Until the early 1990s, the board of The Corp remained under the control of student government and the activities of the two organizations were closely linked.

In addition to improving student resources and services, student government at Georgetown has long played a central role in the allocation of resources to student activities. This has been the case since at least the 1970s, but a notable change occurred in 2001 when a GUSA-led effort successfully established a &quot;Student Activities Fee&quot; to be collected from all students as part of undergraduate tuition, and disbursed to all student organizations by GUSA itself. Today, GUSA allocates more than $1 million per year to eight advisory boards, which in turn allocate their funds to over 300 student organizations.

Student government has traditionally remained focused on student life, but at times the organization has also contributed its voice to political debates on campus and around the country. In 1997, for example, GUSA vocally supported the controversial addition of crucifixes to university classrooms. And in 2011, GUSA President Mike Meaney organized a group letter from more than 100 student body presidents to President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner urging a bipartisan compromise on the national debt ceiling.
== History ==

=== Georgetown University Athletic Association: 1874 to 1920 ===
The earliest form of student government at Georgetown was the Georgetown University Athletic Association, which formed in 1874 in order to coordinate athletics amongst the students of Georgetown College. The Athletic Association was relatively informal in its structure and duties until 1889, when students drafted a constitution and began annual elections. Its leadership consisted of three elected students –– the Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer –– as well as the managers of each athletic team and a Jesuit advisor who held the symbolic title of &quot;President&quot;. That symbolism was soon relinquished, however, and by 1900 the student leader of the Athletic Association was called its President. The Association&#x27;s duties were almost entirely athletic in nature; it coordinated schedules for athletic practices and games, managed the sharing of athletic equipment, and raised funds in order to support activities related to athletics and school spirit.

The Athletic Association was also called &quot;The Yard&quot; interchangeably, in likely reference to the College Yard in which athletic games were played. Its annual leaders were thus referred to as the Yard President, Yard Secretary, and Yard Treasurer.

=== The 3 Student Councils: 1920 to 1969 ===
In 1920, a College Student Council was formed with representatives from each class year. The Athletic Association continued to exist for the limited purpose of coordinating athletics, but the College Student Council supplanted it as the most important and authoritative elected body of the College and thus assumed the title &quot;The Yard&quot;. Unlike the Athletic Association, the Student Council&#x27;s duties were wide-ranging, including advocacy for student interests and the coordination of social life in the College. Students in the College continued to elect three executives each year –– the Yard President, Yard Secretary, and Yard Treasurer –– who oversaw both the old Athletic Association and the new College Student Council.

In 1940, the students of Georgetown College approved a new constitution for the College Student Council which included representation for the College&#x27;s most significant student organizations alongside the representatives of each class. Over the next thirty years, the organizations represented on the Council would include the &quot;Georgetown College Journal&quot;, the Collegiate Club, the Glee Club, &quot;The Hoya&quot;, the International Relations Club, Mask and Bauble, the Philodemic Society, the Sodality, the Washington Club, and WGTB Radio.

Around the same time that the College Student Council was formed in 1920, the students of the newly-established School of Foreign Service (SFS) founded an SFS Student Council. Like its original College counterpart, the SFS Student Council included representatives from each class year as well as the whole school and took on a variety of responsibilities including advocacy and social life. When the School of Languages and Linguistics was founded in 1949 and the School of Business in 1957, their student bodies were incorporated into the SFS Student Council&#x27;s representative infrastructure. By the early 1960s, the group was called the &quot;East Campus Student Council&quot; or &quot;Walsh Area Student Council&quot; to reflect the fact that its constituency now included three undergraduate schools but that all three schools were located on Georgetown&#x27;s &quot;East Campus&quot; (the block between 35th and 36th Streets NW, on which the Walsh Building stands).

At some point in the 1940s or 50s, the students of the Nursing School founded the Nursing School Student Council, which, like its SFS counterpart, included class representatives and school-wide elected officers but &quot;not&quot; representatives of student organizations. The first women to hold elected office in student government at Georgetown did so on the Nursing School Student Council, since the school was originally open only to women.

Administrative collaboration and social interaction between Georgetown&#x27;s five separate undergraduate schools began to increase in the 1950s and 60s, and by the mid-60s there was an unprecedented sense of shared community amongst students of the five schools. Students also began to recognize the practical benefits of university-wide collaboration on the issues that affected students in all schools equally. As a result, several attempts were made throughout the 1960s to unify the three disparate student councils. Unification efforts were finally successful in March 1968, when a referendum passed among the constituencies of all three student councils. In December 1968, students from all schools elected 40 delegates to a constitutional convention, which was charged with drafting a structure for the new, unified student government. The convention released its plans within a few months, and the first university-wide student government election was held in May 1969.

=== Student Government (SG): 1969 to 1984 ===
Simply called the Student Government (SG), the new unified institution included a President and Vice President elected by the entire student body, and a Senate with 5 students elected from each school and 5 from each class (40 in total).

=== Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA): 1984 to present ===
In 1984, students replaced the SG with the Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA), a new institution that over time came to be loosely based on the tripartite structure of the federal government of the United States. GUSA&#x27;s executive branch included a President and Vice President, elected annually by the student body. Its legislative branch consisted of a 16-person Assembly, with 4 representatives from each class year––thus eliminating the last vestiges of differentiated representation for the five schools. After 1990, GUSA also had a judicial branch, consisting of a 3-person Constitutional Council empowered to resolve constitutional disputes within the student government.

The GUSA Constitution has been amended three times:

* In March 1990, students replaced the original GUSA Constitution with a shorter, more streamlined document. They also created a Constitutional Council.
* In October 2006, students replaced the Assembly with the Senate, a larger body made up of representatives from geographic districts across Georgetown&#x27;s campus.
* In February 2018, students voted to maintain the Senate&#x27;s larger size but return it to a system of representation based on class year, rather than geography.

== GU-Qatar Student Government Association (GU-Q SGA)==
The Georgetown University in Qatar-Student Government Association (GU-Q SGA) is an annually elected, student-run governance association that works to represent the student body of Georgetown University in Qatar and liaise with university administrators. In addition, The President of SGA chairs the Student Liaison Commission (SLC), and The Vice President chairs the Student Activities Commission (SAC). The SGA has 11 members, replaced annually. An executive group made up of the President, the Vice President, and the Public Relations Officer guide and preside over the functions of the SGA. A core group of 8 members represents the interests of the student body, with two representatives from each undergraduate class. The SGA meets on a weekly basis and discusses the issues or concerns raised by the student body. The President is also a member of the Dean&#x27;s subcommittees for various issues such as the Dean&#x27;s subcommittee for sustainability.
The introduction of the Red Square, a replica of the famous Red Square in Georgetown University&#x27;s main campus in Washington D.C., was a result of an initiative of the SGA led by President Malak Elmoh (SFS-Q &#x27;21).

Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (SFS-Q &#x27;09), the first President of the SGA was elected in 2006. The official title of the President was changed to Student Body President and Head of SGA, as per the Fourth Amendment to the GU-Q SGA Constitution which was signed and ratified by President Kurian in April 5,2023.

The former Presidents of the Student Government Association include,

The Senate of GU-Q SGA is made up of two class representatives from each batch at GU-Q. They work alongside the SGA President and the executive board to accomplish and meet the student needs. 
Apart from its role in representing students within Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q), the SGA also plays a vital role in representing GU-Q students within the Education City Student Government Association (ECSGA). The ECSGA is an initiative that was founded by President Hadi Darvishi in 2009, with the goal of uniting the student governments of the various universities in Education City. This platform allows for collaboration, shared initiatives, and a collective student voice across the different institutions, strengthening the overall student experience in Education City.
The ECSGA provides a space where student leaders from universities such as Georgetown, Texas A&amp;M, Carnegie Mellon, Weill Cornell, Northwestern, Virginia Commonwealth, and others can work together, address common concerns, and advocate for student needs on a broader level. By being part of the ECSGA, the GU-Q SGA extends its influence and advocacy efforts beyond its own campus, contributing to the larger Education City community. 

In 2022, under the leadership of President Kurian, the Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q) Student Government Association (SGA) hosted a landmark meeting of the Education City Student Government Association (ECSGA) at their campus. This event was particularly significant as it marked the first ECSGA meeting after a hiatus of four years. President Kurian presided over the gathering, which brought together the Presidents and Vice Presidents from all the Student Government Associations across Education City. The meeting served as a key moment for collaboration and discussion among the various student leaders from the institutions based in Education City, fostering a renewed sense of community and cooperation.

GU-Q SGA also holds strong connections with Georgetown University Student Association(GUSA) and Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov),as part of the ‘One Georgetown’ initiative by President Kurian. 

In 2024, under the leadership of President Abdelhady (then Chief of Staff), GU-Q SGA established an Academic Council with cooperation from their counterparts in Washington D.C.

President Kvaratskhelia, who went on to pursue an accelerated masters program at the Washington D.C. campus, was elected the dual-degree MSFS rep for 2022-23. She was selected as the student speaker for the Georgetown University MSFS Commencement exercises in 2024.

<doc id="1278990" wikidata="Q162873" url="?curid=1278990" title="List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower">
<text>On the Eiffel Tower, 72 names of French men (scientists, engineers, and mathematicians) are engraved in recognition of their contributions. Gustave Eiffel chose this &quot;invocation of science&quot; because of his concern over the protests against the tower, and chose names of those who had distinguished themselves since 1789. The engravings are found on the sides of the tower under the first balcony, in letters about tall, and were originally painted in gold. The engraving was painted over at the beginning of the 20th century and restored in 1986–87 by Société Nouvelle d&#x27;exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, the company that the city of Paris contracts to operate the Tower. The repainting of 2010–11 restored the letters to their original gold colour. There are also names of the engineers who helped build the Tower and design its architecture on a plaque on the top of the Tower, where a laboratory was built as well.

== List ==

=== Location ===
The list is split in four parts (one for each side of the tower). The sides have been named after the parts of Paris that each side faces:
* The North-East side (also known as La Bourdonnais side)

* The South-East side (also known as the Military School side)

* The South-West side (also known as the Grenelle side)

* The North West side (also known as the Trocadéro side)
=== Names ===
In the table below are all the names on the four sides.

== Criticism ==

=== Women ===
The list contains no women. The list has been criticized for excluding the name of Sophie Germain, a noted French mathematician whose work on the theory of elasticity was used in the construction of the tower itself. In 1913, John Augustine Zahm suggested that Germain was excluded because she was a woman.

=== Hydraulic engineers and scholars ===
Fourteen hydraulic engineers and scholars are listed on the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel acknowledged most of the leading scientists in the field. Henri Philibert Gaspard Darcy is missing; some of his work did not come into wide use until the 20th century. Also missing are Antoine Chézy, who was less famous; Joseph Valentin Boussinesq, who was early in his career at the time; and mathematician Évariste Galois. Other famous French mathematicians are missing from the list: Joseph Liouville and Charles Hermite.

<doc id="1278993" wikidata="Q5644760" url="?curid=1278993" title="Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds">
<text>Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds were a 1970s soft rock trio from Los Angeles. The original members were Dan Hamilton (guitar/lead vocal), Joe Frank Carollo (bass/vocal), and Tommy Reynolds (multi-instrumentalist/vocal), all of whom had previously played in The T-Bones, a 1960s band noted for the instrumental hit &quot;No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach&#x27;s In)&quot;.

The group first hit the charts in 1971 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Pull Your Love&quot;. Reynolds left the group in late 1972 and was replaced by keyboardist Alan Dennison, but the band kept the name Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds until 1976. This revised line-up performed the group&#x27;s biggest hit, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;.

==New line-up==
The touring T-Bones formed by Dan Hamilton&#x27;s brother Judd Hamilton hit the road in January 1966 to promote their first single &quot;No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach&#x27;s In)&quot;, an instrumental piece based upon a then-popular Alka-Seltzer TV commercial. After tens of thousands of miles of touring, Dee and Torres decided to leave the band and were replaced by Tommy Reynolds (who would, in 1969, be the lead singer for Shango) and Joe Frank Carollo. &quot;No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach&#x27;s In)&quot; reached #3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March 1966. This revised version of The T-Bones toured the US and Japan. Their third and final album was not commercially successful and they disbanded near the end of 1967.

==Big hit==
In 1970, Dunhill Records offered a recording contract to the newly formed Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds. The following year, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pull Your Love&quot;, produced by Steve Barri and arranged by Jimmie Haskell, hit #1 on the Cash Box Top 100, peaked at #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, sold over one million US copies, and was awarded a gold record by the RIAA in August 1971. Two more singles (&quot;Annabella&quot; and &quot;Daisy Mae&quot;) charted, but two Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds albums and several other singles failed to register any significant chart action.

Tommy Reynolds left the group in late 1972. Hamilton and Carollo continued touring with various session musicians, such as Larry Knechtel on keyboards and Joe Correro on drums. However, with their lack of success, their contract with Dunhill was cancelled in 1973. With the addition of Alan Dennison and Rick Shull, Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds continued to perform locally.

==Name change and later years==
In the latter part of 1974, they secured another recording deal with Playboy Records on the proviso that they retain the name Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds, even though Reynolds had left the group. Within another few months, they released &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;, which reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also became their second gold disc and their only song to appear on the UK Singles Chart, where it was licensed to Pye Records and reached #33 in the autumn of 1975.

They followed this success with &quot;Winners &amp; Losers&quot;, which reached #21 in 1976, but their next releases, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight the Hands (That Need You)&quot; and &quot;Everyday Without You&quot;, failed to reach the Top 40. While the band retained their original name on the cover of their &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; album, the back cover showcased the more accurate name &quot;Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Dennison&quot;. For &quot;Love &amp; Conversation&quot;, their second Playboy Records album in 1976, the band officially changed their name to Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Dennison. In 1980, they again disbanded, this time permanently.

Hamilton continued to write and publish songs, and also wrote and recorded a couple of film themes. In late 1993, he became seriously ill and was eventually diagnosed as suffering from Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Hamilton died in Los Angeles on December 23, 1994, at the age of 48.

==Pop culture==
In an episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;—Number 97, Season Five, Episode Two—the characters jokingly discussed how difficult it is for the average person to determine exactly how many people were in the group. Without seeing the name written down, one could assume it was a quartet (&quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, and &quot;Reynolds&quot;), a duo (&quot;Hamilton Joe Frank&quot; and &quot;Reynolds&quot;), a trio (consisting instead of &quot;Hamilton Joe&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, and &quot;Reynolds&quot;), or even a quintet (&quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Frank&quot;, &quot;Ann&quot;, &quot;Reynolds&quot;).

&quot;Don&#x27;t Pull Your Love&quot; was featured at the beginning of &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;In the Shadow of 2 Gunmen Part II&quot;. The song was also heard in the movie &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;. It was also featured in the 2017 DC animated feature &quot;Batman and Harley Quinn&quot;. &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot; appeared in the 2007 film &quot;The Hitcher&quot;.

A running joke from radio personality Dan Ingram, while a DJ at WABC AM, involved introducing the group as &quot;Hamilton, Joe, Frank Reynolds and the entire Eyewitness News team&quot;, a reference to the band and a nod to ABC news anchor Frank Reynolds during his tenure as co-anchor of &quot;World News Tonight.&quot;

<doc id="1279010" wikidata="Q6475558" url="?curid=1279010" title="Lake Cushman">
<text>Lake Cushman () is a lake and reservoir on the north fork of the Skokomish River in Mason County, Washington. The lake originally was a long narrow broadening of the Skokomish River formed in a glacial trough and dammed by a terminal moraine from the Vashon Glaciation during the most recent ice age.

The lake was expanded after construction of the Cushman Dam No. 1. The lake is maintained by this dam and provides electrical power to the Tacoma Power system.

As a popular retreat for hiking, fishing, boating and kayaking, Lake Cushman&#x27;s shoreline is dotted with resorts and rental cabins. The lake is notable for its beautiful crystal clear blue water and the huge round rocks surrounding it, as well as thick stands of hemlock, fir and cedar trees.

== Name ==
The Twana call Lake Cushman, as well as Mount Washington, a nearby mountain, .

Lake Cushman was named in honor of Orrington Cushman, who served as interpreter for Governor Isaac Stevens during the Treaty of Point Elliott negotiations with the Indigenous peoples of Puget Sound in 1854.

== Geography ==
Lake Cushman sits at above sea level and its maximum depth reaches up to . It is estimated to be around in length. The northern part of the lake (FS-24) is near the Staircase Entrance to Olympic National Park. The closest city is Hoodsport, located to the southeast via State Route 119. Surrounding the lake are Mount Ellinor, Mount Washington, Cub Peak, Mount Gladys, and Mount Rose. Access to Lake Cushman is limited during the winter months due to road closures and hazardous conditions. In an average winter, the lake water level drops by .

== History ==
The Skokomish people, a subgroup of the Twana, have inhabited Lake Cushman and the surrounding land since time immemorial. There was a village of the Skokomish near what is now Skokomish Park, which was, prior to the construction of the dam, the furthest south extent of the lake.

In 1889, the Antlers Hotel was built on Lake Cushman by a pair of East Coast businessmen on the property of Russell Homan. It attracted tourists from the Seattle area, who would arrive at Hoodsport by steamship and continue onward to Lake Cushman via stagecoach. The two-story hotel was destroyed in 1925 after it was inundated by rising lake waters following the construction of the Cushman Dam No. 1 by the City of Tacoma. After the property was flooded, many have attempted to search for the remains of the hotel under the lake.

=== 2020 traffic jam incident ===
In August 2020, the U.S. Forest Service temporarily closed all public roads leading to Lake Cushman due to concerns of overcrowding amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A weekend traffic jam on the lake&#x27;s primary two-lane, unpaved road had caused concerns about access for emergency vehicles, including an incident where one man died of drowning. The Forest Service also cited the congregation of people as being a potential vector for spreading COVID-19 and noted several fights, assaults, and other incidents.

== Recreation ==

=== Hiking ===

The Lake Cushman area offers access to multiple hiking trails on the Western side of the lake:

* Big Creek Campground Trail #827
* Big Creek Trailhead 
* Big Creek Upper Loop #827.1
* Copper Creek Trail #876
* Dry Creek East Trailhead 
* Dry Creek Trail #872
* Jefferson Pass Trailhead
* Mt. Ellinor Connector Trail #827.2
* Mt. Ellinor Lower Trailhead 
* Mt. Ellinor Trail #812 
* Mt. Ellinor Upper Trailhead

The Northern side of the Lake has various trails following the Skokomish River, which include: 
* Staircase Trailhead
* Copper Creek Trailhead
* Shady Lane Trail head

The Eastern side of the lake contains several trails within United Stats Forest Service Land:
* Jacob&#x27;s Peak Trail
* Lake Cushman Park Trail

=== Fishing ===
Lake Cushman has year-round open season fishing and is stocked with Kokanee salmon and Cutthroat trout. Besides officially stocked fish, the lake also contains various species of trout, bass, sculpins, and salmon. Skokomish Park is fitted with a boat ramp with three paved ramps that allows access to the lake for a small day-use fee. Boat rentals are also available at the park.

=== Swimming and watersports ===

Swimming, boating, kayaking and cliff jumping are also among the most popular activities for Lake Cushman visitors. Public access to the lake is available at Skokomish Park and Lake Cushman Resort.

== Lodging ==

The Skokomish Park campground is a former state park that was sold to private operators in 2002. The campground includes tent and RV campsites, group campsites and picnic areas. Further away from the lake are Big Creek Campground in Olympic National Forest and Staircase Campground in Olympic National Park. Big Creek offers tent sites and RV parking and is situated from the lake. Staircase is from Lake Cushman and offers 47 camping sites.

The Lake Cushman Resort was permanently closed in 2018 due to the expiration of its 50-year lease with Tacoma Public Utilities.

<text>The Saint Mary&#x27;s University of Minnesota (SMUMN) is a private Catholic university with its primary campuses in Winona and Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It comprises an undergraduate residential college in Winona; graduate and professional programs in Winona, the Twin Cities, and Rochester; and course delivery sites in Minnesota and Wisconsin as well as Jamaica. The institution was founded in 1912 and is associated with the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, also known as the De La Salle Brothers.

==History==
Bishop Patrick Richard Heffron founded Saint Mary&#x27;s College in 1912, a men&#x27;s college operated by the Winona Diocese. Heffron Hall, a residential hall was built in 1920, and named after Bishop Heffron. By 1925 it became a four-year liberal arts college. In 1933, it was taken over by the De La Salle Christian Brothers, a religious order whose main charism is teaching. It became a co-educational university in 1969 and later purchased the campus and buildings of the former College of Saint Teresa, a women&#x27;s college in Winona that ceased operations in 1989. In recent years, portions of the Saint Teresa campus were sold to Winona State University and Winona Cotter High School.

During the 1980s the main Winona campus underwent vigorous growth. Constructed during this decade were the Ice Arena (1986), Performance Center, including Figliulo Recital Hall and Joseph Page Theatre (1987), Brother Charles Hall science addition (1987), Gilmore Creek Residence (1989), and Christian Brothers Residence (1989). More recent additions include McEnery Center (1993), Gostomski Fieldhouse and Jul Gernes Pool (1994), pedestrian plaza (1994), Pines Hall residence (1995), Hendrickson Center (1996), The Heights (1997), Oscar and Mary Jane Straub Clocktower and Court (1999), Hillside Hall residence (2001), ice arena addition (2004) a soccer field / track complex in 2008, Brother Leopold Hall (2012, which includes an outdoor recreation center donated by the Winona ski club), and the new freshmen residence hall Brother William completed in 2019. During the summer of 2021, the old Adducci science building was renovated and renamed Aquinas Hall, which includes a new facility for the University&#x27;s nursing program.

Beginning in 1985, then-president Louis DeThomasis launched a series of new, non-traditional graduate and professional programs. The Schools of Graduate and Professional Programs, using a variety of course delivery methods and locations, is now one of Minnesota&#x27;s largest graduate schools. SGPP programs are delivered at the Twin Cities campus, Rochester center, Apple Valley center, Minnetonka center, Oakdale center, and at locations around Minnesota and Wisconsin. The university has a partnership with Catholic College of Mandeville, Jamaica. In 2011, the Twin Cities campus added Harrington Mansion and Saint Mary&#x27;s Event Center to its expanding facilities on Park Avenue in Minneapolis.

In 1995, Saint Mary&#x27;s College was renamed Saint Mary&#x27;s University of Minnesota to reflect the expanded role of graduate and professional programming, and to distinguish Saint Mary&#x27;s from schools with similar names.

===Presidents===

==Academics==
Saint Mary&#x27;s University offers a wide range of degrees. The university offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctorate degrees for both traditional and non-traditional students. In addition to the degrees, Saint Mary&#x27;s also offers teaching licensures, certifications, and pre-professional programs. Both undergraduate and graduate programs offer online learning. Men study for the priesthood at the adjacent Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary, owned and operated by the Diocese of Winona.

===Changes in 2022===
Due to financial difficulties and low undergraduate enrollment, in May 2022, the university announced plans to phase out 11 majors including English, history, theatre, music, art, and theology. The president of the university, James P. Burns, said about the decision, &quot;In particular, what we looked at is the majors that we are phasing out are those that really were low enrolled and also didn&#x27;t hold great promise in terms of what many families and students want, which is marketable skills and jobs after college.&quot;

==Athletics==

The university&#x27;s sports teams are nicknamed the &quot;Cardinals&quot; (previously the &quot;Redmen&quot; until 1988) and compete as a member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC). There are 21 NCAA Division III varsity sports teams at Saint Mary&#x27;s. The Saint Mary&#x27;s fastpitch softball team won the 2000 NCAA Division III National Title. That title was the university&#x27;s first and so far only national team title. In 1955, the college administration elected to discontinue football as a sport at the university. A task force was formed in 2005 to study the feasibility of adding football, but the proposal was rejected in 2006 by a unanimous vote of the board of trustees.

There is an on-campus cross country ski and running trail in the bluffs and valleys of the campus. Athletic facilities are being renovated and expanded. Upgrades were recently made to basketball, baseball and softball. A challenging disc golf course was installed in the bluffs and valleys around campus in 2007. A state-of-the-art outdoor track and soccer complex, and a high-and-low ropes course, were added in 2008.

Saint Mary&#x27;s has long had a friendly crosstown rivalry in non-conference athletics with NCAA Division II member Winona State University.

<doc id="1279031" wikidata="Q540288" url="?curid=1279031" title="Papaflessas">
<text>Grigorios Dimitrios Dikaios-Flessas (; 1788 – 25 May 1825), popularly known as Papaflessas (), was a Greek priest and government official who became one of the most influential figures during the Greek War of Independence. The prefix () in the name &quot;Papaflessas&quot; indicates his status as a cleric since the word means &#x27;priest&#x27; in Greek. He was appointed Archimandrite in 1819. He served as Minister of Internal Affairs and Chief of Police in the government of Alexander Mavrokordatos. Papaflessas was killed during the Battle of Maniaki on May 20, 1825, fighting against the forces of Ibrahim Pasha at Maniaki, Messinia.

==Name==
Georgios Dimitrios Dikaios-Flessas was his birth name. His monastic name was Grigorios Flessas (, Grigórios Flessas) or Papaflessas, while the pseudonym he used later in his life was Grigorios Papaflessas ().

==Early life==
Grigorios Papaflessas was born Georgios Flessas or Flesias () in 1788 in the village of Poliani in Messinia. His father was Demetrios G. Flessas (), son of the klepht Georgios Dimitriou Flessas (), and his mother, the second wife of Dimitrios, was Konstantina Andronaiou () from Dimitsana. He was the 28th child of the Dimitrios family. In 1809, he attended school at the renowned school of Dimitsana, from whence many Greek national heroes graduated. While in school, he published a satire and pinned it on the door of Dimitsana Pasha (the Turkish local governor at the time) signing it &quot;Grigorios Phos Kalamios&quot; (). Realizing he was in danger from his action he was sent in 1815 to become a priest or monk, taking the ecclesiastical name of Gregorios Flessas or Papaflessas. For a short time, he served in this capacity in the monastery of Velanidia, situated outside of the city of Kalamata, Messinia.

==Clergy==
Grigorios was argumentative and defiant by nature and frequently at odds with his ecclesiastical superiors. Further, he was angry toward the Ottoman Turks because they had killed his family members. He also blessed a marriage of Mr. Zervas to his niece who was engaged to another man. He was asked to leave the monastery of Velanidia.

In April 1816, he moved to the monastery of Rekitsa (), located between Leontari and Mystras. He soon argued with his superiors and the monastery&#x27;s administration. He also came into conflict with a local Turkish authority over the boundaries of the monastery property and even used armed men to protect his claims. This eventually was settled by court in Tripolitsa with the court finding in Papaflessas&#x27; and the monastery&#x27;s favour. This angered the Turkish official who told the authorities that Papaflessas was a revolutionary and was arming the (&#x27;slaves&#x27;, as the Turks used to call Greeks) against the Turks. The Tripolitsa authorities sentenced Papaflessas to death and sent soldiers to the monastery to arrest and execute him. Armed Poliani fighters delayed the soldiers and Papaflessas was able to leave his homeland, saying as he did so that he would return either a bishop or a pasha and deal with them.

Papaflessas went to the island of Zakynthos, a haven for Greeks from the mainland who were under death sentence by the Turks. There he met fellow Greek future revolutionist Theodoros Kolokotronis. He obtained a reference letter from the Archbishop of Christianoupolis (Arcadia Kyparissia). While traveling by sea to Constantinople, Papaflessas was shipwrecked on Mount Athos during which the seal on his letter of recommendation broke. Reading the letter he was surprised to find that it called him dishonest, immoral and untrustworthy, causing him to discard the letter.

He arrived in Constantinople with the goal of studying Ancient Greek and theology and to become an archbishop in the patriarchy of Agia Sofia. While studying Greek and the Periklis harangue, he also started meeting prominent &quot;patriots&quot;. Because he was under death sentence by the Turks, and due to his reputation from Peloponnisos, he used the name Dikaios. He soon joined the secret organization Filiki Eteria with the code name Armodios (A. M.), , and the number five (5).

In 1819, Gregorios was ordained to the highest priesthood position, archimandrite, a rank next to bishop, by Patriarch Gregorios V of Constantinople and he was given the ecclesiastical &quot;&quot;officio&quot; of Dikaios&quot; (the Ecumenical Patriarch&#x27;s representative), in order to be able to move freely in the Moldovlachia area and not to be bothered by the Turks. Papaflessas was sent to the northern part of the Ottoman Empire to inspire and spread hope among his countrymen for the nation&#x27;s independence from the Turks.

==Action in Resistance==
Returning to Constantinople from his successful mission, Papaflessas again came to the attention of the Turkish authorities and had to flee. At the end of 1820, he sailed to Aivali of Asia Minor and catechised all scholars of the Big School (as it was called there) while awaiting the arrival of war supplies from Smyrna. From Smyrna he received military supplies and the assurance of additional ammunition if needed.

Papaflessas traveled to several areas seeking support for a revolution against the Ottoman Empire. At the Saint George monastery he called a meeting of Greek authorities and high priests to discuss if the time was right to start the a revolution. After heated arguments the meeting was postponed for a later time in the monastery of Agia Lavra.

In January 1821 meetings took place with Papaflessas recounting his supplies and assurances of support coming from Russia. Concerns about the practicalities of war and the uncertainty of the promises of military support led the other participants to propose to secretly jail Flessas in the monastery of Agia Lavra in order to avoid problems for the nation. But Papaflessas had armed supporters and no one dared arrest him. The synod decided to get further information and the opinion of neighbouring countries before starting a revolution.

Flessas&#x27; problem was with the upper class (landowners) in the villages and municipalities, including the top echelon of the clergy, who did not trust Papaflessas, and his mission was received with a great deal of scepticism and fear. He felt safer to first approach farmers and peasants, and the poor class of people who were easily magnetized by his speeches looked upon him as the messiah of their freedom.

After the meeting he went to Kalavryta and met with Nikolaos Souliotis and Asimakis Skaltsas in order for them to write a letter in the first ten days of March 1821 to Oikonomos Eliopoulos. Then he retreated to Kalyvia Kalamata waiting for news from Souliotis and Skaltsas and the arrival in Almyros, a small port near Kalamata, of the boat with the war supplies. From Kalyvia he went secretly to Gardikion (now Amfeia) near his hometown Poliani and learned that the small boat of Mexis Poriotis arrived in Almyros. Papaflessas immediately called his brothers and Nikitas Flessa, the oldest brother, received the ammunitions.

In March 1821, he received news the ship with military supplies had arrived. He gathered about 400 men with mules and donkeys from the Poliani area and went to Almyros Kalamata. In order to unload the boat they had to have the authorization of the area&#x27;s harbourmaster, the famous Mavromichalis, who was in the pay of the Turks&#x27; security force. The harbourmaster demanded a large bribe to cover up what the Greeks were unloading.

Papaflessas sent 45,000 grosia to Mavromichalis who accepted it but still did not sign the proper papers. He wanted half of the supplies in the boat to have them as reserves to fight the Greeks when they started the revolution against the Turks. This was agreed to and the supplies were transported to the monastery of Velanidia, where Papaflessas served as a monk, summoning prominent , chieftains from the area. By purpose or accident some of the gunpowder was dropped at a local well and the next day the stablemen of the local pasha found and reported it. The pasha summoned all the prominent Greeks and clergy from the Kalamata area and jailed them.

Papaflessas arranged his men to cover various strategic positions in the area. When a Turkish sympathizer tried to leave the city he was killed, starting the war of Independence on March 21, 1821. In Mani a gathering of the captains of the rebels had decided to start the revolution on March 25, 1821, but received news on the 22nd that the fighting had already begun. The Greek War of Independence officially started on March 25, 1821, and brought a great change to the church of the free kingdom. The clergy had taken a leading part in the revolution.

==Papaflessas during the Revolution (1821–1825)==

In 1823, Papaflessas was named the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Chief of Police by the government of Prince Alexander Mavrokordato under the name Gregorios Dikaios, the name he had when he was in Filiki Etairia. He instituted many reforms, established the mail system and built schools in various towns. He created the title of Inspector General for schools and he was the first to establish a political conviction certificate to be given to the friends of the government. He took part in many battles against the Turks and he sided with the government when the civil war started in 1824. He took part in the campaign in Messinia and the rest of the Peloponnese to suppress the rebels against the Government. During the civil war, he was initially on Theodoros Kolokotronis&#x27; side, but later switched sides due to his personal ambitions.

The fight against Ibrahim

When Ibrahim Pasha invaded the Peloponnese in 1825 (with an army consisting mostly of Egyptians), Papaflessas was still Minister of Internal Affairs. Realizing the great danger the nation was facing with the Ibrahim&#x27;s invasion, he demanded the government grant amnesty to Kolokotronis and other political prisoners. This demand was refused and he appeared before the executive branch and parliament to tell them he would go to Messinia alone to organize a resistance against Ibrahim, determined to return victorious or die in the battlefield.

George Finlay writes in his book, “The archimandrite Daikaios (Pappa Phlessas) was still Minister of the Interior. He was the most unprincipled man of the party of the Moreot chiefs. The universal indignation now expressed at his conducts convinced him that it would be dangerous for him to remain in Nauplia, where his licentious life and gross peculation pointed him out as the first object of popular vengeance, and the scapegoat for the sins of his colleagues. The archimandrite was destitute of private virtue and political honesty, but he was a man of activity and courage. Perhaps too, at this decisive moment a sense of shame urged him to cancel his previous misdeeds by an act of patriotism. He asked permission of the government to march against the Egyptians, boasting that he would vanquish Ibrahim or perish in the combat”.
Papaflessas gathered 3,000 poorly armed men and went to the province of Pylia, Messinia, searching for the best spot to face Ibrahim&#x27;s army coming out of the city of Pylos. He selected the hills of Maniaki in order for him to have a better view of the enemy&#x27;s movements and there Papaflessas established three lines of defence. On June 1, 1825, Ibrahim&#x27;s forces led by well-trained French officers attacked Papaflessas&#x27; defence lines. Most of the Greek troops lost their nerve, abandoned their positions, and fled. Papaflessas continued to fight the Egyptians with a small force of 800-1000 men loyal to him and his cause.

Papaflessas knew that in choosing to face Ibrahim he would die on the battlefield. Papaflessas&#x27;s defenses were ultimately broken by the heavy bombardment of Ibrahim&#x27;s artillery and the repeated attacks of his infantry and cavalry. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting ended with the death of the last defender.

After Papaflessa&#x27;s death from a bullet in the chest, Ibrahim ordered that his body be cleaned of blood and dirt and tied to a tree. After a few minutes of looking at his foe, Ibrahim walked up to the corpse and kissed it on the cheek as a sign of extreme respect. In speaking of Papaflessas after his death, it is said that Ibrahim told his officers: &quot;If Greece had ten heroes like him, it would not have been possible for me to undertake the military campaign against the Peloponnese&quot;.

==Legacy==
Papaflessas remains a key revolutionary figure in Greek history and places and events have been named in his honour. Such instances include an annual international athletics meeting in Kalamata called Papaflessia and a former municipality in the Peloponnese called Papaflessas

<text>The concept of the  (Latin), world soul (, ), or soul of the world (, ) posits an intrinsic connection between all living beings, suggesting that the world is animated by a soul much like the human body. Rooted in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, the idea holds that the world soul infuses the cosmos with life and intelligence. This notion has been influential across various systems of thought, including Stoicism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and Hermeticism, shaping metaphysical and cosmological frameworks throughout history.

In ancient philosophy, Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot; introduces the universe as a living creature endowed with a soul and reason, constructed by the demiurge according to a rational pattern expressed through mathematical principles. Plato describes the world soul as a mixture of sameness and difference, forming a unified, harmonious entity that permeates the cosmos. This soul animates the universe, ensuring its rational structure and function according to a divine plan, with the motions of the seven classical planets reflecting the deep connection between mathematics and reality in Platonic thought.

Stoicism and Gnosticism are two significant philosophical systems that elaborated on this concept. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BCE, posited that the universe is a single, living entity permeated by the divine rational principle known as the logos, which organizes and animates the cosmos, functioning as its soul. Gnosticism, emerging in the early centuries of the Common Era, often associates the world soul with Sophia, who embodies divine wisdom and the descent into the material world. Gnostics believed that esoteric knowledge could transcend the material world and reunite with the divine. 

Neoplatonism and Hermeticism also incorporated the concept of the world soul into their cosmologies. Neoplatonism, flourishing in the 3rd century CE through philosophers like Plotinus and Proclus, proposed a hierarchical structure of existence with the World Soul acting as an intermediary between the intelligible realm and the material world, animating and organizing the cosmos. Hermeticism, based on writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, views the world soul as a vital force uniting the cosmos. Hermetic texts describe the cosmos as a living being imbued with a divine spirit, emphasizing the unity and interconnection of all things. Aligning oneself with the world soul is seen as a path to spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine, a belief that experienced a resurgence during the Renaissance when Hermeticism was revived and integrated into Renaissance thought, influencing various intellectual and spiritual movements of the time.

== Ancient philosophy ==

=== Plato ===

Plato described the universe as a living being in his dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot; (30b–d):

Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; describes this living cosmos as being built by the demiurge, constructed to be self-identical and intelligible to reason, according to a rational pattern expressed in mathematical principles and Pythagorean ratios describing the structure of the cosmos, and particularly the motions of the seven classical planets. The living universe is also a god titled Ouranos and Kosmos, which shows, as scholars have argued, that Plato mediates between the poetic and presocratic traditions.

In &quot;Timaeus&quot;, Plato presents the cosmos as a single, living organism that possesses a soul and intelligence. The demiurge, a divine craftsman, creates the universe by imposing order on pre-existing chaotic matter. This creation is not ex nihilo but rather a process of organizing the cosmos according to the eternal Forms, which are perfect, immutable archetypes of all things.

Plato explains that the world soul is a mixture of the same and the different, woven together to form a unified, harmonious entity. This soul permeates the entire cosmos, animating it and endowing it with life and intelligence. The world soul is responsible for the rational structure of the universe, ensuring that everything functions according to a divine plan.

The rational pattern of the cosmos is expressed through mathematical principles and Pythagorean ratios, reflecting the deep connection between mathematics and the structure of reality in Platonic thought. The motions of the seven classical planets (the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) are particularly significant, as they embody the harmony and order of the universe.

Plato&#x27;s identification of the cosmos as a god, titled Ouranos and Kosmos, reveals his synthesis of different philosophical traditions. The name Ouranos connects the world soul to the ancient Greek personification of the sky, while Kosmos signifies order and beauty. By mediating between poetic and presocratic traditions, Plato integrates mythological and philosophical elements into a coherent cosmological vision.

=== Stoicism ===
The Stoic school of philosophy, founded by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BCE, significantly contributed to the development of the concept of the world soul. Stoicism posits that the universe is a single, living entity permeated by a divine rational principle known as the &quot;logos&quot;. This principle organizes and animates the cosmos, functioning as its soul.

Central to Stoic cosmology is the belief that the &quot;logos&quot; operates as the rational structure underlying all existence. This rational principle is equated with God, nature, and the soul of the universe, making the cosmos a living, rational organism. The Stoics identified the world soul with the concept of &quot;pneuma&quot;, a life-giving force that pervades and sustains all things. &quot;Pneuma&quot; is a mixture of air and fire, elements considered active and capable of bestowing life and motion.

The Stoic philosopher Cleanthes described the world soul in his &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;, where he praises Zeus (a personification of the &quot;logos&quot;) for harmonizing the cosmos and ensuring its rational order. Chrysippus, another prominent Stoic, further developed the idea of the world soul, arguing that it is the animating principle that ensures the coherence and unity of the cosmos.

The Stoic view of the world soul differs from Plato&#x27;s in that it emphasizes the materiality of the &quot;pneuma&quot;. For the Stoics, the soul of the universe is not an abstract, separate entity but a physical presence that interpenetrates the cosmos, providing it with structure and purpose. This physicalist interpretation reflects the Stoic commitment to the idea that only bodies can act and be acted upon.

The Stoic concept of the world soul also has ethical implications. Since the &quot;logos&quot; governs the cosmos rationally, living in accordance with nature means aligning one&#x27;s life with this rational order. The Stoics believed that by understanding and accepting the world&#x27;s rational structure, individuals could achieve a state of tranquility and virtue.

== Gnosticism and Neoplatonism ==

=== Gnosticism ===
Gnosticism, a diverse and syncretic religious movement that emerged in the early centuries of the Common Era, also incorporated the concept of the world soul into its cosmological and theological framework. Gnostic systems generally posited a dualistic worldview, contrasting the material world with a higher, spiritual reality. In this context, the world soul often played a crucial role in bridging the divine and material realms.

In Gnostic thought, the world soul is often associated with the figure of Sophia (Wisdom), who embodies both the divine wisdom and the tragic descent into the material world. Sophia&#x27;s fall and subsequent redemption are central themes in many Gnostic texts. According to the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, a key Gnostic scripture, Sophia&#x27;s emanation resulted in the creation of the material world, which is seen as flawed and distant from the divine &quot;pleroma&quot; (fullness).

In Gnostic systems, the concept of the world soul often carries significant ethical and soteriological implications. Gnostics believed that by acquiring esoteric knowledge and understanding their divine origin, individuals could transcend the material world and reunite with the divine. This process of gnosis involved recognizing the world soul&#x27;s entrapment in the material realm and working towards its liberation.

==== Manichaeism ====
In Manichaeism, a major Gnostic religion founded by the prophet Mani in the 3rd century CE, the world soul was also called the Light Soul and the Living Soul (), contrasting it with matter, which was associated with lifelessness and death and within which the world soul was imprisoned. The world soul was personified as the Suffering Jesus (&quot;&quot;) who, like the historical Jesus, was depicted as being crucified in the world. This &quot;mystica cruxificio&quot; was present in all parts of the world, including the skies, soil, and trees, as expressed in the Coptic Manichaean psalms.

==== Mandaeism ====
Mandaeism, another Gnostic tradition that has survived to the present day, also incorporates a concept akin to the world soul. In Mandaean cosmology, the soul&#x27;s journey through the material world and its eventual return to the World of Light is a central narrative. The soul&#x27;s purification and ascent are facilitated by esoteric knowledge and ritual practices.

=== Neoplatonism ===
The concept of the world soul continued to influence later philosophical thought, particularly in the development of Neoplatonism. Neoplatonists such as Plotinus and Proclus expanded on Plato&#x27;s ideas, emphasizing the unity and divinity of the cosmos and its connection to the One, the ultimate source of all existence.

Neoplatonism, which flourished in the 3rd century CE, is a philosophical system that builds upon the teachings of Plato and incorporates metaphysical elements. Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism, articulated a vision of reality that centers on a hierarchical structure of existence. At the pinnacle of this hierarchy is the One, an ineffable and transcendent principle from which all reality emanates. The One generates the &quot;Nous&quot; (Divine Mind), which in turn produces the World Soul.

The World Soul in Neoplatonism functions as an intermediary between the intelligible realm (the realm of the Forms) and the sensible world (the material universe). Plotinus describes the World Soul as the vital force that animates and organizes the cosmos, imbuing it with life and intelligence. It is both one and many, maintaining unity while simultaneously generating individual souls and entities within the cosmos.

Proclus, a prominent later Neoplatonist, further developed these ideas. He posited a more elaborate structure, with the World Soul divided into a higher, more divine aspect and a lower, more material aspect. This dual nature allows the World Soul to mediate between the purely intellectual and the physical realms, ensuring the coherence and order of the universe.

The Neoplatonists viewed the World Soul not only as a metaphysical principle but also as a means to achieve personal and cosmic harmony. By aligning one&#x27;s soul with the World Soul, individuals could attain a higher state of being and participate in the divine order of the cosmos. This process involves philosophical contemplation, ethical living, and the cultivation of virtues that reflect the harmonious nature of the World Soul.

The influence of Neoplatonism extended beyond the classical period, significantly impacting early Christian, Islamic, and Renaissance thought. The integration of Platonic and Neoplatonic ideas into Christian theology, particularly through the works of Augustine and Pseudo-Dionysius, demonstrates the enduring legacy of the concept of the World Soul.

== Medieval and Renaissance thought ==

=== Scholasticism ===
During the 12th-Century Renaissance of the High Middle Ages, the analysis of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; by members of the School of Chartres like William of Conches and Bernardus Silvestris led them to interpret the world soul as possibly or certainly the same as the Christian Holy Spirit under the covering () of another name. As or immediately after Peter Abelard was condemned by Bernard of Clairvaux and the 1141 Council of Sens for doctrines similarly close to pantheism, William condemned his own writings on the subject and revised his to avoid its discussion.

=== Hermeticism ===
Hermeticism, a spiritual, philosophical, and esoteric tradition based primarily on writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, integrates the concept of the world soul into its cosmological framework. The Hermetic tradition, which flourished in the Hellenistic period and saw a revival during the Renaissance, views the world soul as a vital, animating force that permeates and unites the cosmos.

Hermetic writings, particularly the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; and the &quot;Asclepius&quot;, emphasize the unity and interconnection of all things in the universe. These texts describe the cosmos as a living being imbued with a divine spirit or soul. The world soul is seen as the intermediary between the divine intellect (&quot;Nous&quot;) and the material world, ensuring the harmonious functioning of the cosmos.

In the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, the world soul is often depicted as an emanation of the divine that sustains all creation. This soul is responsible for the life, order, and movement within the universe, acting in accordance with the divine will. The Hermetic worldview is deeply rooted in the idea that understanding and aligning oneself with the world soul can lead to spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine.

==== Paracelsus ====
The Renaissance alchemist and physician Paracelsus significantly contributed to the Hermetic tradition by integrating the concept of the world soul into his medical and alchemical theories. Paracelsus believed that the world soul, which he referred to as the &quot;Archeus&quot;, was the vital force that governed the processes of nature and the human body. He posited that health and disease were influenced by the balance and interaction of this vital force within individuals.

Paracelsus&#x27; view of the world soul extended to his understanding of the macrocosm and microcosm, where the human body (microcosm) is a reflection of the larger universe (macrocosm). By studying the world soul&#x27;s manifestations in nature, Paracelsus believed that alchemists and physicians could uncover the secrets of health and transformation.

==== Giordano Bruno ====
Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century Italian philosopher, theologian, and occultist, significantly contributed to the Renaissance revival of the Hermetic tradition. His work is known for its bold integration of Hermeticism, Copernican heliocentrism, and an infinite universe theory, which brought the concept of the world soul into a new, expansive context.

Bruno’s cosmology was groundbreaking in that it proposed an infinite universe populated by innumerable worlds. Central to this vision was the idea of the world soul, or &quot;anima mundi&quot;, which Bruno described as an immanent and animating force pervading the entire cosmos. He argued that the world soul is the source of all motion, life, and intelligence in the universe, linking all parts of the cosmos into a single, living entity.

In his work &quot;De la causa, principio et uno&quot; (&quot;On Cause, Principle, and Unity&quot;), Bruno articulated his belief in the unity of the universe and the presence of a single, universal spirit. This spirit, akin to the world soul, ensures the cohesion and harmony of the cosmos, reflecting the Hermetic principle of the interconnectedness of all things.

Bruno was deeply influenced by the Hermetic texts, particularly the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, which he saw as containing profound truths about the nature of the universe and the divine. His philosophy integrated the Hermetic concept of the world soul with the revolutionary scientific ideas of his time, leading to a vision of the cosmos that was both mystical and rational.

Bruno&#x27;s emphasis on the world soul can also be seen in his metaphysical poetry and dialogues, where he often depicted the universe as a divine, living organism animated by an internal spirit. This perspective was revolutionary, challenging the Aristotelian view of a finite, hierarchical cosmos and aligning more closely with the Hermetic and Neoplatonic traditions.

Bruno’s radical ideas, including his support for the Copernican model and his concept of an infinite universe with a pervasive world soul, led to his persecution by the Roman Catholic Church. He was tried for heresy and ultimately burned at the stake in 1600. Despite his tragic end, Bruno&#x27;s ideas significantly influenced later thinkers and contributed to the development of modern cosmology and metaphysics.

==== Robert Fludd ====
Another key figure in Hermeticism, Robert Fludd, elaborated on the concept of the world soul in his extensive writings on cosmology and metaphysics. Fludd&#x27;s works depict the world soul as the divine &quot;anima mundi&quot; that connects all levels of existence, from the highest spiritual realms to the material world. He emphasized the idea of cosmic harmony, where the world soul orchestrates the symphony of creation, maintaining balance and order.

Fludd&#x27;s illustrations and writings highlight the Hermetic belief in the interconnection of all things, with the world soul as the binding principle that ensures the unity of the cosmos. His work reflects the Hermetic conviction that by attuning oneself to the world soul, one can achieve deeper knowledge and spiritual enlightenment.

== Later European philosophers ==

Although the concept of a world soul originated in classical antiquity, similar ideas can be found in the thoughts of later European philosophers such as those of Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schelling, and Georg W.F. Hegel (particularly in his concept of &quot;Weltgeist&quot;).

== Modern relevance ==
The concept of Anima Mundi, or the World Soul, continues to resonate in contemporary philosophical, ecological, and spiritual discourse. Modern interpretations often explore the interconnectedness of life and the universe, reflecting ancient notions through new lenses.

=== Ecological perspectives ===
In contemporary environmental philosophy, the idea of Anima Mundi is often invoked to emphasize the intrinsic value of nature and the interconnectedness of all living things. Ecologists and environmentalists draw parallels between the ancient concept and modern holistic approaches to ecology. James Lovelock&#x27;s Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth functions as a self-regulating system, echoing the idea of the World Soul animating and organizing the cosmos. This holistic view suggests that recognizing the Earth as a living entity can foster a deeper environmental ethic and a sense of stewardship for the planet.

=== Philosophical and scientific discourse ===
Philosophers like David Abram have explored the phenomenological aspects of Anima Mundi in the context of sensory experience and perception. Abram&#x27;s work emphasizes the animate qualities of the natural world, suggesting that recognizing the Earth&#x27;s sentience can foster a deeper ecological awareness and a sense of kinship with all forms of life. Additionally, systems thinking and complexity theory in science reflect a renewed interest in holistic and integrative approaches that resonate with the concept of the World Soul, highlighting the interconnection and interdependence of various components within ecological and social systems.

=== Spiritual and New Age movements ===
The Anima Mundi also finds relevance in modern spiritual and New Age movements, where it is often associated with the idea of a living, conscious Earth. Practices such as Earth-centered spirituality, animism, and certain strands of neopaganism embrace the notion of the World Soul as a guiding principle for living in harmony with nature. These movements emphasize rituals, meditations, and practices aimed at connecting with the spirit of the Earth and recognizing the sacredness of all life.

=== Literature and the arts ===
The influence of the Anima Mundi extends into contemporary literature and the arts, serving as a metaphor for exploring themes of unity, interconnection, and the mystery of existence. Authors and artists draw on the symbolism of the World Soul to convey a sense of wonder and reverence for the natural world. This is evident in the works of poets like Mary Oliver, who often evoke the living essence of nature in their writings, and in the visual arts, where the interplay of life and the cosmos is a recurring theme.

<text>Erik Johan Mattias &quot;Notan&quot; Norström (born 2 January 1972) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman, currently working for the AIK organization. Norström began his National Hockey League career with the New York Rangers. However, he is most noted for his ten seasons as a member of the Los Angeles Kings for whom he served as team captain from 2001–2007; he was the team&#x27;s first non-North American-born captain and would represent the Kings twice in the NHL All Star Game. Norström played the final season of his NHL career for the Dallas Stars.

==Playing career==
===AIK===
As a youngster, he played for several years in the &quot;talent factory&quot; Huddinge IK although this original club was Mälarhöjden/Bredäng Hockey. In his teens he moved from Huddinge to AIK (Stockholm), where he started playing in the senior team from 1991. He was drafted in the second round, 48th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft and began his NHL career in 1993 with that team.

===NHL===
Norström split his time in the Rangers organization between the parent club and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Rangers. On 14 March 1996, he was traded with Nathan LaFayette, Ian Laperrière, Ray Ferraro and a draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings for Marty McSorley, Jari Kurri and Shane Churla. In Los Angeles he developed into a solid stay-at-home defender and anchor of the Kings&#x27; blueline. On 1 October 2001, he was appointed team captain after Rob Blake had been traded to the Colorado Avalanche.

During the NHL lockout in 2004–05, Norström played with his previous Swedish team, AIK. The team was playing in the third-tier league, struggling to advance, when Norström arrived. He helped lead them through the playoffs, and to secure a spot in the second tier league the following year.

Norström was originally appointed to the Swedish national team for the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin but had to withdraw due to injury.

When Rob Blake returned to the Kings on 1 July 2006, Norström called him and offered the captaincy back. Blake refused at his presentation press conference and told the media that he regarded &quot;Matty&quot; as the obvious captain and the &quot;core and soul&quot; of the Kings.

Norström was acquired by the Dallas Stars through a trade with the Kings on 27 February 2007, which sent defencemen Jaroslav Modrý and Johan Fransson, a 2008 first round draft pick, a 2007 second round draft pick, and a 2007 third round draft pick to Los Angeles in exchange for Norström, forward Konstantin Pushkarev, a 2007 third round pick, and a 2007 fourth round pick.

On 30 April 2008, he scored the game-winning goal (and first NHL playoff goal of his career) in the first overtime against the San Jose Sharks, allowing the Stars to take a 3–0 series lead.

On 10 June 2008, Norström announced his retirement from hockey. On 20 June 2011, Norström joined the AIK organization as a sports manager and sounding board for Anders Gozzi.

<doc id="1279048" wikidata="Q7986865" url="?curid=1279048" title="West Virginia Media Holdings">
<text>West Virginia Media Holdings was a media company in West Virginia. It owned television stations in each of the four main media markets in the state, as well as a weekly newspaper.

The group owned WOWK-TV in Huntington, WVNS-TV in Lewisburg, and WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia, which were all affiliated with the CBS network; and WBOY-TV in Clarksburg which was affiliated with NBC. WVNS and WTRF also carried Fox on their digital subchannels, while both subchannels carried MyNetworkTV in addition to Fox as a secondary affiliate. It also owned a weekly newspaper, &quot;The State Journal&quot;, which mainly covers state commerce and political news.

The group was founded in 2001. The largest private investor in the company was Bray Cary, who served as president and CEO. Cary was formerly an executive with NASCAR, and was responsible for its television contracts before they switched to a bulk network model, along with college basketball syndication.

In August 2008, both WTRF and WBOY began carrying ABC programming on their digital subchannel. Previously, longtime ABC affiliate WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh served both markets as the &quot;de facto&quot; ABC affiliate and remains on cable in both markets (Fox Ohio Valley replaced WPGH on Comcast systems as the only Fox affiliate on the Comcast channel lineup).

On November 17, 2015, WVMH announced that it would sell its stations to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $130 million. The company would take over the stations&#x27; non-license assets under a time brokerage agreement in December 2015 until the formal completion of the deal, expected in late-2016. The two companies viewed the acquisition as being a complement to Nexstar&#x27;s WHAG-TV, whose coverage area includes the Eastern Panhandle region. Nexstar CEO Perry A. Sook is an alumnus of WOWK. The sale was completed on January 31, 2017.

&quot;The State Journal&quot; was separately acquired by NCWV Media in December 2016.

<text>CSS &quot;Teaser had been the aging [[Georgetown, D.C.]] [[tugboat]] &quot;York River&quot; until the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], when she was taken into the [[Confederate States Navy]] and took part in the famous [[Battle of Hampton Roads]]. Later, she was captured by the [[United States Navy]] and became the firstUSS &quot;Teaser.
==CSS &quot;Teaser&quot;==
&quot;Teaser&quot; was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Purchased at Richmond, Virginia, by the State of Virginia in 1861, she was assigned to the naval forces in the James River with Lieutenant James Henry Rochelle, Virginia State Navy, in command. Upon the secession of Virginia, &quot;Teaser&quot; became a part of the Confederate States Navy and continued to operate in Virginia waters. With Lieutenant William A. Webb, CSN, in command, she took an active part in the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 8–March 9, 1862, acting as tender to CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;. She received the thanks of the Congress of the Confederate States for this action.

&quot;Teaser&quot; was a pioneer &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;, serving as a base for an observation gas-filled balloon; she also became a pioneer minelayer when ordered on June 17, 1862, to assist General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. Under Lieutenant Hunter Davidson, CSN, she was used by the Confederate Naval Submarine Battery Service to plant and service &quot;torpedoes&quot; (mines) in the James River. While engaging at Haxall&#x27;s on the James on July 4, 1862, a Union shell blew up &quot;Teaser&quot;″s boiler and forced her crew to abandon ship. When seized by &quot;Maratanza&quot;, &quot;Teaser&quot; was carrying on board a balloon for aerial reconnaissance of Union positions at City Point and Harrison&#x27;s Landing.

===Commanders===
The commanders of the CSS &quot;Teaser&quot; were:

* Lieutenant James H. Rochelle (May–June 1861)
* Lieutenant Robert Randolph Carter (June–July 1861)
* Acting Master William H. Face (June 1861 – January 1862)
* Lieutenant William A. Webb (February 1862 –)
* Lieutenant Hunter Davidson (June–July 1862)

==USS &quot;Teaser&quot;==
Later that summer, &quot;Teaser&quot; was taken into the United States Navy and was assigned to the Potomac Flotilla. With the exception of three brief deployments elsewhere, USS &quot;Teaser&quot; the waters of the Potomac River from Alexandria, Virginia, south to Point Lookout, Maryland, to enforce the blockade by interdicting a thriving trade in contraband between the Maryland and Virginia shores.

On September 22, she captured schooner &quot;Southerner&quot; in the Coan River. On October 19, while operating in the vicinity of Piney Point in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, she captured two smugglers and their boat as they were nearing the exit of Herring Creek and preparing to cross the river to Virginia. On November 2, near the mouth of the Rappahannock River, the tug surprised three men attempting to violate the blockade in a canoe. &quot;Teaser&quot; took them prisoner and turned their contraband over to pro-Union Virginians living on Gwynn&#x27;s Island. Four days later in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Teaser&quot; took the cargo-less sloop &quot;Grapeshot&quot; and captured her three-man crew.

By December 1862, she had moved to the Rappahannock River with other units of the Potomac Flotilla to support General Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s thrust toward Richmond. On December 10, she exchanged shots with a Confederate battery located on the southern shore of the river about three miles below Port Royal, Virginia. After Burnside&#x27;s bloody rebuff at Fredericksburg, Virginia, on December 13, &quot;Teaser&quot; and her colleagues returned to their anti-smuggling patrol along the Potomac.

&quot;Teaser&quot; joined to make March 1863 an active month. On March 24, the two ships sent a boat expedition to reconnoiter Pope&#x27;s Creek, Virginia. The landing party found two boats used for smuggling and collected information from Union sympathizers in the area. Almost a week later, on the night of March 30—March 31, they dispatched a three-boat party to Monroe&#x27;s Creek, Virginia. The previous day, a Federal cavalry detachment had surprised a smuggler in the area; and, though the troops captured his goods, the man himself escaped. Boats from &quot;Teaser&quot; and &quot;Primrose&quot; succeeded where the Union horsemen had failed, and they gathered some intelligence on other contrabanders as well.

In April 1863, &quot;Teaser&quot; left the Potomac for duty with Acting Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee&#x27;s North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads. On April 17, she joined and in an expedition up the Nansemond River west of Norfolk, Virginia. However, she ran aground, damaged her machinery, and had to retire from the venture.

By mid-summer, &quot;Teaser&quot; was back in action on the Potomac. On the night of July 27, she captured two smugglers with a boatload of tobacco in the mouth of the Mattawoman Creek just south of Indian Head, Maryland. She destroyed the boat and sent the prisoners and contraband north to the Washington Navy Yard. During the night of October 7, &quot;Teaser&quot; and another flotilla ship (extant records do not identify her companion) noticed signalling between Mathias Point, Virginia, and the Maryland shore. The two ships shelled the woods at Mathias Point, but took no action against the signallers on the Maryland shore other than to urge upon the United States Army&#x27;s district provost marshal the necessity of constant vigilance.

On January 5, 1864, &quot;Teaser&quot; and landed a force of men at Nomini, Virginia, to investigate a rumor that the Southerners had hidden a large lighter and a skiff capable of boating 80 men there. The force, commanded by &quot;Teaser&#x27;s&quot; commanding officer, Acting Ensign Sheridan, found both boats, destroyed the lighter, and captured the skiff. During the landing, Confederate soldiers appeared on the heights above Nomini, but the gunboats dampened their curiosity with some well-placed cannon shots.

In April, &quot;Teaser&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, , , and accompanied an Army expedition to Machodoc Creek, Virginia. At 5:00 A.M. on April 13, the five ships cleared the St. Mary&#x27;s River in company with the Army&#x27;s steamer USAT &quot;Long Branch&quot; with a battalion of soldiers under the command of General Edward W. Hinks. &quot;Long Branch&quot; landed her troops at about 8:00 A.M. while the five ships covered the operation. A contingent of Confederate cavalry appeared on the southern bank of the Machodoc, but retired when &quot;Teaser&quot; and &quot;Anacostia&quot; sent four armed boat crews ashore. The landing party netted a prisoner, probably a smuggler, and a large quantity of tobacco. By April 14, General Hinks&#x27; troops reembarked in &quot;Long Branch&quot; and headed for Point Lookout. &quot;Anacostia&quot; accompanied the Army steamer while the other four warships investigated Currioman Bay and Nomini. They returned to St. Mary&#x27;s, Virginia, that afternoon to resume patrols.

During the summer of 1864, &quot;Teaser&quot; was called upon to leave the Potomac once more. On this occasion, the Union forces needed her guns to help defend strategic bridges across the rivers at the head of Chesapeake Bay near Baltimore, Maryland, against Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early&#x27;s raiders. On July 10, she departed the lower Potomac, rounded Point Lookout, and headed up the Chesapeake Bay. That night, she had to put into the Patuxent River because of heavy winds and leaks in her hull. Before dawn the following morning, she continued up the bay. During the forenoon, the leaks became progressively worse and, by the time she arrived off Annapolis, Maryland, she had to remove her exhaust pipe for temporary repairs. Early that evening, &quot;Teaser&quot; reached Baltimore where she put in for additional repairs.

The gunboat did not reach her destination, the bridge over the Gunpowder River, until late on July 12. She was too late; the bridge had already been burned. She returned to Baltimore immediately to report on the bridge and to pick up arms and provisions for the vessels stationed in the Gunpowder River. When she arrived back at the bridge, she found orders to return to the Potomac awaiting her. &quot;Teaser&quot; departed the northern reaches of the Chesapeake and reported back to the Potomac Flotilla at St. Inigoes, Virginia, on the St. Mary&#x27;s River in late afternoon on April 14.

For the remainder of the war, &quot;Teaser&quot; and her flotilla-mates plied the Potomac and contributed to the gradual economic strangulation which brought the South to its knees by April 1865. Less than two months after General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox, Virginia, &quot;Teaser&quot; was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on June 2. Sold at public auction at Washington to Mr. J. Bigler on June 25, the tug was re-documented as &quot;York River&quot; on July 2, 1865, and she served commercially until 1878.

<text>&quot;Danny Boy&quot; is a song with lyrics written by English lawyer Frederic Weatherly in 1910, and set to the traditional Irish melody of &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; in 1913.

==History==

In 1910, in Bath, Somerset, England, the English lawyer and lyricist Frederic Weatherly initially wrote the words to &quot;Danny Boy&quot; to a tune other than &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;. One story is that his sister-in-law Margaret Enright Weatherly (AKA &quot;Jess&quot;) sent him a copy of &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; in 1913, and Weatherly modified the lyrics of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; to fit its rhyme and meter. A different story has Jess singing the air to Weatherly in 1912 with different lyrics. Yet another story is that Frederic did not set the poem to any tune, but that, in 1913, Margaret, who, with her husband Edward Weatherly, was living at the Neosho mine near Ouray, Colorado, in the US, set it to the &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, which she had heard as a child in California played by her father and other Irish railway workers.

Weatherly gave the song to the vocalist Elsie Griffin, who made it one of the most popular songs of the new century. Ernestine Schumann-Heink produced the first recording of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; in 1915.

Jane Ross of Limavady is credited with collecting the melody of &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; in the mid-19th century from a musician she encountered.

== Lyrics ==
The 1913 lyrics by Frederic E. Weatherly:

==Meaning==
There are various conjectures about the meaning of &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. Some interpret the song to be a message from a parent to a son going off to war.

The 1918 version of the sheet music with Weatherly&#x27;s printed signature included alternative lyrics (&quot;Eily Dear&quot;), with the instructions that &quot;when sung by a man, the words in italic should be used; the song then becomes &quot;Eily Dear&quot;, so that &quot;Danny Boy&quot; is only to be sung by a lady&quot;. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this was Weatherly&#x27;s intent, and it is common practice for exactly the same lyrics to be used when sung by both women and men.

==Usage==
* Percy Grainger&#x27;s &quot;Irish Tune from County Derry&quot; adapted the &quot;Danny Boy/Londonderry Air&quot; melody for wind ensemble in 1918.
* The song is popular for funerals, but the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; wrote in 2001 that it &quot;cannot be played during Mass.&quot;
* German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht wrote an alternative version of the lyrics in 1920 and called it &quot;Reminiscence of Marie A.&quot; ().
* An instrumental version of the song is used as the theme to &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;.

==Select recordings==
&quot;Danny Boy&quot; has been recorded multiple times by a variety of performers. Several versions are listed below in chronological order.
*1917 Ernestine Schumann-Heink
*1928 Colin O&#x27;More
*1940 Judy Garland &quot;Little Nellie Kelly&quot; soundtrack. Garland also sang it live at her concerts in Ireland and Scotland and most famously at her New York Palace Theatre debut in 1951.
*1940 Glenn Miller and His Orchestra released a single that climbed to No. 17 in &quot;Pop Memories 1890–1954&quot; (not &quot;Billboard&quot; charts); Arranged by Glenn Miller and pianist Chummy MacGregor.

*1950 Al Hibbler released a single that rose to No. 9 on the US R&amp;B chart.
*1957 Harry Belafonte sang the song live on the album &quot;An Evening with Harry Belafonte&quot;, where he began the song with a spoken recitative, before singing the two verses. He repeated the second half of the first verse the second time around. The Recitative goes: &quot;The Time, a time of strife. The Place, the place is Ireland. And as Irish legend had it, as the last rose of Summer fell, and all the young men of Ireland were to gather to strike a blow For Ireland&#x27;s Freedom and Ireland&#x27;s Liberty, There were songs for those who stayed at home, and songs for those who went away, and all of Ireland was sad&quot;. He modified the lyrics in significant ways. At the end of the first set of lyrics, he changed &quot;I love you so&quot; to &quot;I&#x27;ll miss you so&quot; His changes to the second set of lyrics were more substantial: &quot;But if you fall as all the flowers are dying; and you are dead as dead you well may be; I&#x27;ll come and find the place where you are lying; and kneel and pray and Ave there for thee.&quot; He then repeats the second half of the first set of lyrics as noted above, starting with &quot;But come ye back . . .&quot; and this time finishes it with &quot;I love you so.&quot; These changes made it more explicitly an anti-war message.
*1958 Paul Robeson published a version.

<doc id="1279074" wikidata="Q1866847" url="?curid=1279074" title="Quesada, Spain">
<text>Quesada is a Spanish municipality in the province of Jaén. It is in the Alto Guadalquivir comarca and its inhabitants are called &quot;quesadenses&quot; or &quot;quesadeños&quot;. It has an area of 328.7 km² and 5483 inhabitants according to the 2016 census. Its population has decreased in the last half of the twentieth century. In 1950, 12,224 quesadeños were registered.

The eastern and southern parts of its municipality are part of the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park. The source of the Guadalquivir River is in its municipal district, in the Cañada de las Fuentes.

== Tourism ==

In its municipal area there are caves with rock art, although they are rarely visited, and the remains of a Bronze Age necropolis.

There are also the ruins of the Roman villa of Bruñel, which has some preserved mosaics, the most spectacular of which is dedicated to the goddess Thetis (others are exhibited in the Provincial Museum of Jaén). The villa is next to an early Christian basilica and is open to the public.

More recent is the &quot;Watchtower of the Infante Don Enrique&quot;, dated 1314, above the port of Tíscar. It is open to the public and offers wide views.

Tíscar Castle, with a fragmentary tower, is next to the Water Cave, a natural cavern containing an impressive waterfall (except during times of drought). According to legend, the Virgin of Tíscar, patron saint of Quesada, appeared to the king of Tíscar, Mohamed Abdón, within the cave in the fourteenth century. At the foot of the castle, on a plateau, stands the sanctuary of the Virgin of Tíscar. It retains a primitive Gothic style door of the 14th century. Its interior contains an altar in Neo-Romanesque style made in painted terracotta by artists from Orea y Baños. There are rich gates of Granada from the 17th century, as well as votive lamps from the 18th century. The paintings from different eras of great masters are kept. The verses of Antonio Machado dedicated to the Virgin of Tíscar and the Sierra de Quesada are sculpted in the sanctuary square and on a stone slab. In turn, it was a tribute to the Sevillian poet that the town of Quesada honored him in 1957. 

There is a building on Avenida de Almería where all the paintings by Rafael Zabaleta and his friends are available. Paintings from all periods of the painter are preserved, in a chronological way, and were donated by the heirs of Zabaleta to the town of Quesada. Currently, and since March 28, 2015, it houses the Miguel Hernández Museum and his wife Josefina Manresa.

== Economy ==
In agriculture, the olive grove dominates, being part of its olive cooperative (La Bética Aceitera) of the designation of origin &quot;Sierra de Cazorla&quot;.

Cereal cultivation is now vestigial, as it has been replaced by olive groves.

== Holidays ==
From January 19 to January 21, the festival of San Sebastián is celebrated. Residents of Quesada will wear flags, have drummers, and lights to shine on key areas of the town.

The two most important holidays, both dedicated to the Virgin of Tíscar, are held in August and in May. On the first Saturday of May, a pilgrimage occurs to bring the Virgin of Tíscar to its sanctuary. It is known as the &quot;brought of the Virgin&quot; day. During this trip, the Virgin of Tíscar crosses the town to the church, where she will remain until the end of August. During the trip, the quesadeños throw rose petals. On the mantle of the Virgin of Tíscar, they pin fifty or one hundred euro bills as an offering. 

The summer holiday begins on August 23 and ends on August 28. On the dawn of the 29th, the Quesada locals travel to the Virgin of Tíscar to bring it back to the town. They begin at the town and make their way to the sanctuary, which is 14 kilometres away. The locals travel on foot to the Humilladero cross, located at the exit of the town. Here, the quesadeños and people of the region give an emotional farewell to the Mother of God and her Most Holy Son. From there, the trip continues in a vehicle.

In the annex of Belerda, the Feast of the Charges or Feast of the God Boy is celebrated, a tradition that goes back to the 16th century reminiscent of the festival of Moors and Christians and currently, the clothes that carry the charges are old uniforms of the nineteenth century. The party starts on December 25. The five &quot;Charges&quot;, the first and second captain, the flag bearer, the guidance, and the small charge, accompanied by the drummer and an enthusiastic entourage, depart on the 26th towards the Sanctuary of Tíscar where the image of the Virgin. During the return, from cortijada to cortijada, the tasty products of the slaughter and the good wine receive the entourage. On the 27th, with the renewal of the &quot;Charges&quot; of the coming year, this party ends.

== Gastronomy ==
The most unique dish is the talarines, a close relative of the Gazpacho manchego and the tatters, consisting of a stew of meat, vegetables, and mushrooms in which dough wafers are cooked that are broken into pieces (hence the name of tatters).

Pipirrana, crumbs, porridge, ajoharina, gachurreno, etc. are also prepared.

Some typical quesadeños sweets are: fig bread, papajotes, sweet gachillas, florets, drunkards, and bath donuts.

== Quesada people ==
* Rafael Zabaleta (1907-1960), painter.
* José Luis Verdes painter, although born in Madrid, was closely related to Quesada, where he sponsored a children&#x27;s painting contest. One of the local schools is named after him.

<text>Ronald Frederick Bradley Tugnutt (born October 22, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. Tugnutt played several seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Quebec Nordiques, Edmonton Oilers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Pittsburgh Penguins, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Dallas Stars. While a member of the Nordiques on March 21, 1991, Tugnutt set a modern-day NHL record for most saves in a regular-season game when he stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3–3 tie with the Boston Bruins.

After retiring as a player, Tugnutt served as the president, governor, and coach of the Central Canada Hockey League&#x27;s Kemptville 73&#x27;s.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Tugnutt was born in Scarborough, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Toronto.

Tugnutt played three seasons with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey League, and won the F. W. &quot;Dinty&quot; Moore Trophy for the rookie with the best goals against average, followed by the Dave Pinkney Trophy for Top Team Goaltending, and was named to the OHL All Star team in 1987.

===NHL beginnings===
He was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the fourth round (81st overall) of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He was primarily used as a backup during his first three pro seasons, bouncing up and down between the Halifax Citadels of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the parent club in Quebec City. During 1990–91 NHL season, Tugnutt played what would be a career-high 56 games for Quebec and established himself as a quality NHL starter despite playing for what was then the worst team in the league.

On March 21, 1991, Tugnutt stopped 70 of 73 shots to earn his team a 3–3 tie against the Boston Bruins, the highest number of saves made in a regular season game in NHL history. His performance evoked such respect that after it was over, several Bruins players skated over to congratulate Tugnutt while the Boston fans gave him a standing ovation.

In the midst of an inconsistent 1991–92 NHL season, and with the emergence of Stéphane Fiset as the Nordiques&#x27; number one goaltender, Tugnutt was demoted to the Nordiques&#x27; AHL affiliate. In exchange for Martin Ručinský, he was soon traded to the Edmonton Oilers to serve as Bill Ranford&#x27;s backup. Tugnutt remained in this role until he was selected by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 1993 expansion draft. In Anaheim, he split goaltending duties with Guy Hebert.

Anaheim quickly settled on Hebert as their future starter, and the Montreal Canadiens decided that André Racicot and Les Kuntar were not adequately serving as Patrick Roy&#x27;s backup, so Tugnutt was acquired by the Canadiens in exchange for Stéphan Lebeau. Tugnutt&#x27;s performance suffered; for Anaheim he had posted a .908 save percentage in 28 games, but for Montreal, he posted an .860 save percentage in eight games during the 1993–94 season.

During the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Bruins, Tugnutt started a game as Patrick Roy was recuperating from an appendectomy, but he did not return to the Canadiens for the 1995–96 season, and was replaced by Patrick Labrecque. These experiences caused Tugnutt to ponder retirement.

===Career breakthrough===
In 1995, Tugnutt signed a one-year deal with the Washington Capitals, and subsequently spent the entire 1995–96 season with their AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates. He was productive in Portland, helping lead the Pirates to the Calder Cup Finals.

This strong performance caught the attention of the Ottawa Senators. Goaltending coach Phil Myre helped Tugnutt work on fundamentals, and gained confidence and improved his game each season. While in Ottawa, he went from fighting for the backup position with Mike Bales to splitting duties with starter Damian Rhodes the next two seasons, and became the team&#x27;s undisputed starting goaltender by 1999.

On April 12, 1997, Tugnutt shutout the Buffalo Sabres in the final game of the regular season. Tugnutt&#x27;s father had just died and immediately following the win Tugnutt pointed to the rafters to signify the win was for his father, in what became an iconic image of Tugnutt. This win propelled the Senators to their first playoff berth.

In 1998–99, Tugnutt had the best season of his career, and one of the best by an NHL goaltender in the modern era. He posted a league-best goals against average of 1.79, placed second in the league in save percentage at .925, had a career high in wins, and tied a career high in shutouts. This outstanding play, and an injury to Curtis Joseph, gave Tugnutt the opportunity to play in the 1999 NHL All-Star Game.

The next season, Rhodes was shipped to the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, giving Tugnutt sole possession of the starting job. However, he was unable to match his previous season and Ottawa traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins for an experienced playoff goaltender, Tom Barrasso.

After arriving in Pittsburgh, Tugnutt took over the starting job from Jean-Sébastien Aubin and helped lead Pittsburgh deep into the playoffs. Tugnutt was in goal for the May 4, 2000, playoff game against the Philadelphia Flyers in which he made 70 saves on 72 shots. The 72nd shot was a goal scored by Keith Primeau of the Flyers at 12:01 of the fifth overtime, winning the game for Philadelphia 2–1, the longest NHL game since the 1930s.

Following his performance with Pittsburgh, Tugnutt became one of the most sought-after free agent goaltenders on the market. Both Ottawa and Pittsburgh attempted to re-sign Tugnutt but were unable to match the lucrative contract offered by the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets.

During Columbus&#x27; inaugural season, Tugnutt was considered their backbone. Tugnutt&#x27;s 22 wins broke another NHL record for most wins on an expansion team, and his .917 save percentage was among the best in the league.

The team&#x27;s second season was not as impressive as the first. Tugnutt battled injuries and ended up sharing time with young netminder Marc Denis. General Manager Doug MacLean gave Denis the opportunity to be the sole starter on the club, and traded Tugnutt to the Dallas Stars.

In 2002–03 Tugnutt was the backup to Marty Turco. In January 2003, Turco suffered an ankle injury that allowed Tugnutt to start almost 20 straight games, and he posted back to back shutouts during that stretch. For the season, he played 31 games and posted a 15-10-5 record including four shutouts.

The 2003–04 season was possibly Tugnutt&#x27;s toughest in the NHL, as by January he only received three starts. He was sent down to the minors for the first time in almost ten years to get some playing time with the Utah Grizzlies. Just five games in, Tugnutt pulled his groin and was out until after the All Star break. Soon after, he was recalled to the Dallas Stars. After two solid starts, one of which was a shutout, Tugnutt received a break when Turco received a four-game suspension. He retired following the 2003–04 season.

===Post-retirement===
After the lockout, Tugnutt joined CBC as a color commentator for &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. From 2008–09 to 2009–10, Tugnutt served as the goaltending coach for the OHL&#x27;s Oshawa Generals and was a goaltending consultant for the 2010 Canadian World Junior team. Tugnutt&#x27;s contract with the Generals was not renewed after a major front office shakeup in May 2010. Tugnutt joined the Peterborough Petes coaching staff for the 2010–11 season. Tugnutt was a consultant with Hockey Canada until 2013 when that relationship ended. Tugnutt then moved behind the bench of his sons&#x27; team, the Kemptville 73&#x27;s.

==Off the ice==
Tugnutt is married to Lisa, and the couple have two sons, Jacob and Matthew. The family resides on Stoney Lake near Peterborough, Ontario.

Tugnutt enjoys boating and traveling. In the summer of 1998, Tugnutt was involved in a severe boating accident, and it was suspected that he might miss out on training camp. Tugnutt healed and had the best season of his career, breaking the modern-day NHL record for lowest G.A.A. and coming second in the league in save percentage.

Tugnutt previously owned the Kemptville 73&#x27;s, a Junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey team, where he served as head coach, president and governor. Tugnutt sold the team to an ownership group led by former teammate Jason York.

==Honours and records==
* Modern-day record holder for most saves in a regular season game non-loss (stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3–3 tie with the Boston Bruins; March 21, 1991).
* Holds Mighty Ducks of Anaheim record for most saves in a regular season game with 46, set against the Edmonton Oilers on November 21, 1993).
* Tied with Dominik Hašek for Ottawa Senators highest regular season save percentage.
* Leader in save percentage for the 1999–2000 Playoffs.
* Holds Pittsburgh Penguins record for highest save percentage in the playoffs.
* Holds NHL record for being the only goaltender to have the first ever wins for 2 expansion teams - Columbus and Anaheim.

==International play==
After a disappointing 4-game sweep in the NHL playoffs, Tugnutt was more than excited to play for Team Canada in the 1999 World Hockey Championships. The semi-final game was against the Czech Republic in which Canada lost after the game went undecided in overtime, ending in a shootout. This was Tugnutt&#x27;s second appearance on Team Canada, also playing for them in 1993.

<text>Entropia Universe is a massively multiplayer online (MMORPG) virtual universe designed by the Swedish software company MindArk, based in Gothenburg.

&quot;Entropia&quot; uses a micropayment business model, in which players may buy in-game currency (PED - Project Entropia Dollars) with real money that can be redeemed back into U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of 10:1. This means that virtual items acquired within &quot;Entropia Universe&quot; have a real cash value, and a participant may, at any time, initiate a withdrawal of their accumulated PED back into U.S. dollars according to the fixed exchange rate, minus transaction fees. The Entropia Universe is a direct continuation of Project Entropia.

&quot;Entropia Universe&quot; entered the Guinness World Records Book in both 2004 and 2008 for the most expensive virtual world objects ever sold. In 2009, a virtual space station, a popular destination, sold for . This was then eclipsed in November 2010 when Jon Jacobs sold a club named &quot;Club Neverdie&quot; for ; this property was sold in chunks, with the largest sold for . The game has been described as dedicated to capitalism rather than quality of gameplay, and connecting the in-game labor with real world profits, in which sense it can be seen as a spiritual precursor to the play to earn model.

== Gameplay ==

The game can be played for free, but spending money on the in-game currency allows significant additional options like purchasing items, skills, deeds/shares, and services from other players. Nearly all of the main in-game activities require expendable resources which must be purchased. Items can also be crafted for use or for sale to other players.

== Development ==
In 1995, development of &quot;Entropia Universe&quot; (formerly &quot;Project Entropia&quot;) was started by two different groups - one in Sweden headed by Jan Welter Timkrans and one in Switzerland, headed by Benny Iggland. Initially taking place on the fictional Planet Calypso, the 2001 version used the NetImmerse 4 game engine. On May 20, 2002, the Commercial Open Trial began, and the game was available to the public. With Version Update 4.2 on 28 January 2003, the game was considered &quot;Gold&quot;.

In 2022, the developers of &quot;Entropia Universe&quot; began development work on the migration to Unreal Engine 5. The migration to Unreal Engine 5 will include the &quot;evolution of core systems, such as hunting, mining and crafting&quot; and the &quot;migration of items and value currently present in Entropia Universe&quot; ensuring that the game&#x27;s economic and item-based systems are preserved and integrated into the updated game client.

== Significant events and virtual property sales ==

*December 14, 2004 – Game creators MindArk announced the conclusion of the first &quot;Treasure Island Sale&quot;, a virtual island put up for auction. The winning bidder paid 265,000 PED () for the island, the highest price ever paid for a virtual item.
*October 24, 2005 – A virtual &quot;asteroid space resort&quot; was bought by Jon &quot;Neverdie&quot; Jacobs for a sum of 1,000,000 PED (), surpassing the sale of Treasure Island.
*May 2, 2006 – MindArk announced the introduction of an ATM card enabling players to withdraw the real-world currency equivalent of their PED funds directly from any Versatel ATM. It was stated that $165 million had &quot;passed through the game&quot; in 2005 and that this figure was expected to double in 2006.
*October 17, 2006 – MindArk announced that Entropia Universe had reached 500,000 registered users.
*May 8, 2007 – MindArk announced the results of a &quot;virtual banking license auction&quot;. These two-year exclusive licenses aimed to integrate real world banking systems into Entropia Universe, working similarly to real-world banks or pawn shops. Initially, they would be provided with secure systems enabling them to lend money and collect interest, design and name their own virtual bank building(s), and make their own personnel available through avatars. Each winner would be required to add a further as working capital. After months of bidding, the six licenses sold for a total of .

<text>John Gregory Huarte (; born April 6, 1944) is an American former professional football quarterback who played with several teams in the American Football League (AFL), the National Football League (NFL), and in the World Football League (WFL) between 1965 and 1975. He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, where he won the 1964 Heisman Trophy. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Early life and college==
Huarte was born and raised in Orange County, California; his father Joseph was a former minor league baseball player of Basque descent. The family ran an orange and avocado ranch and he graduated from Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana in 1961.

Huarte played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. During his sophomore and junior seasons, he averaged only a few minutes per game due to injuries and the Irish went 5–5 and 2–7, respectively. As a senior in 1964 under new Irish head coach Ara Parseghian however, he became the starting quarterback as the Irish won all but one game during the 1964 season, in which he was selected as an All-American and won the Heisman Trophy. By the end of the season, Huarte threw for 2,062 yards with only 205 passes, an average of over ten yards per pass attempt, many to receiver Jack Snow.

Huarte was a member of the College All-Star team in the annual pre-season game against the defending NFL champions at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field. The 1965 game was in early August against the Cleveland Browns and Huarte was named the game&#x27;s most valuable player.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Huarte was drafted in 1965 by both pro football leagues: he was the twelfth overall selection of the AFL draft and the 76th pick of the NFL draft. He signed with the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets over the NFL Philadelphia Eagles, but was beaten out for the starting position by fellow-rookie Joe Namath, the first pick of the AFL draft, who had finished eleventh in the Heisman voting as a senior at Alabama. The AFL Jets thus signed both the Heisman Trophy winner and the Alabama star away from the NFL. Huarte was third on the depth chart behind co-starters Namath and Mike Taliaferro and was on the taxi squad. Following the 1965 season, Huarte was traded to the Boston Patriots for Jim Colclough and the draft rights to Wichita State linebacker/center Jim Waskiewicz.

Subsequently, Huarte did see action as a back-up quarterback for several other professional teams from 1966 to 1972. Out of the NFL in 1973, he played his final two seasons of professional football as the starting quarterback of the Memphis Southmen of the World Football League, which folded before the completion of the 1975 season.

==After football==
Huarte is the founder and Owner of Arizona Tile. In 2005, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Huarte is married to Eileen Devine from Woodside, New York. They have 5 children and 14 grandchildren and live in Pacific Palisades, Ca. 
In 1977, he started a tile/granite store in San Diego. It has now grown to 30 locations, with over 1000 employees throughout the United States. It is still family owned and operated by John and Eileen Huarte and their children.

<text>St. James is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba.

==Historical riding==
The original St. James riding was established at the province&#x27;s creation in 1870, and lasted until the election of 1879. It was located in what was then a separate community on Winnipeg&#x27;s periphery.

==List of provincial representatives==
==Modern riding==
The modern St. James riding was created by redistribution in 1957 out of part of Assiniboia, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1958. The riding is located in the western section of Winnipeg.

St. James is bordered on the east by Wellington, Minto and Wolseley, to the south by Tuxedo, to the north by Wellington and Lakeside, and to the west by Assiniboia and Kirkfield Park.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,417. In 1999, the average family income was $47,842, and the unemployment rate was 6.20%. Almost 19% of St. James&#x27;s population is over 65 years of age, and almost 38% of dwelling units are rented.

The service sector accounts for 15% of St. James&#x27;s industry, following by government services (14%) and manufacturing (13%).

St. James was a marginal Progressive Conservative/NDP riding for most of its history to 1988. It was won in that year by Liberal Paul Edwards, who was elected leader of his party in 1993. The NDP recaptured the seat in 1995.

==Recent boundary changes==
The St. James riding underwent a dramatic redistribution in 1999. Previously, the space the riding occupied roughly the same space as the riding of Minto, which was newly created that year and, as of 2019, exists as Notre Dame. In fact, the original plan of the Manitoba Electoral Boundaries Commission in 1999 was to rename St. James as Minto, and create a new riding called King Edward to its immediate west (primarily from the old riding of Sturgeon Creek). Instead, the boundaries legislation passed by the Manitoba legislature in 1999 determined that the new riding would be called St. James.

Although the current riding has some territory in common with its predecessor of the same name, it is probably more accurately regarded as the successor riding to Sturgeon Creek. The NDP captured this seat from the Tories in 1999, and retained it in 2003.

<doc id="1279117" wikidata="Q663900" url="?curid=1279117" title="Heinkel He 343">
<text>The Heinkel He 343 was a quadjet bomber project designed by the German aircraft manufacturer Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke during the final years of the Second World War. It was intended to perform aerial reconnaissance and fighter-bomber operations in addition to its use as a fast bomber.

The project commenced work in January 1944 as a new jet-powered bomber that emphasised flexibility in terms of mission role and engine fitout. Munitions were to be carried both externally and internally. Four variants of the He 343 were envisioned to perform bombing, reconnaissance, and direct fire support roles. The Government Air Ministry (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;) quickly issued an initial order for 20 aircraft, which Heinkel worked on fulfilling. Despite lobbying efforts by the company&#x27;s founder, Ernst Heinkel, to maintain the project, during late 1944, work was halted on the project and the order cancelled on account of Germany&#x27;s deteriorating military situation necessitating the diversion of limited resources towards other programmes closer to production. Both design information and many of the components were recovered from Heinkel by the Soviet Union near the end of the conflict. The He 343 was allegedly studied in great detail by the Soviets and played a crucial role in the development of the Ilyushin Il-22, the first Soviet jet-bomber.

==Design and development==
Work on what would become the He 343 commenced during January 1944. That same month, the German aircraft manufacturers Heinkel and Junkers were both personally approached by Siegfried Knemeyer, the Head of Technical Development at the Government Air Ministry (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;), with a request to develop a four-engined jet-powered bomber as a &quot;crash&quot; programme with a short development window of roughly one year. By that point, Heinkel had already played a key role in pioneering jet propulsion during the 1930s, and was keen to develop combat-ready jet-powered aircraft that would be procured in large numbers to meet the wartime needs of the Luftwaffe.

Accepting this request, Heinkel quickly designed a four-engined bomber with unswept wings that were attached at the center of the fuselage. It was to be operated by a crew of two, who were seated within a pressurised glazed cockpit at the front of the aircraft; an optional third crew member may have also been carried for some mission roles. The engines, which were individually mounted beneath the wings, could alternatively be Junkers Jumo 004, BMW 003, or Heinkel HeS 011 powerplants. Armaments and/or equipment were to be carried both internally and externally; while up to 2,000 kg of bombs could be accommodated within the bomb bay, the bomb racks underneath the wings would have provided additional mounting points. Defensive armaments include a pair of fixed rear-facing MG 151 20mm cannons, which were installed within the fuselage.

Operationally, it was to be faster than previous peers as to better evade interception, and flexible enough to perform alternative roles such as aerial reconnaissance and fighter-bomber duties; pursuing compatibility with multiple turbojet engines also reduced some of the potential manufacturing difficulties. To shorten its development, considerable attention was paid to the existing Arado Ar 234 jet bomber; to this end, design information was supplied by Arado and the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS) to Heinkel.

From at early stage, four distinct models of the aircraft were planned. The He 343 A-1 was a dedicated bomber variant. Amongst the munitions it was intended to carry was the Fritz X guided Anti-ship glide bomb, which would have been radio controlled from the aircraft by a third crew member. The He 343 A-1 was very similar to the He 343 A-2, the variant intended for reconnaissance missions. For extended endurance, an additional 2,400 kg of fuel could be carried in an additional tank in the bomb bay instead of munitions; a pair of Rb 75/30 cameras would have been used for photo reconnaissance. The He 343 A-3 was envisioned for battlefield support, being armed with a pair of MG 151 20mm cannons in addition to four forward-firing MK 103 30mm cannons mounted with its bomb bay. The He 343 B-1 also performed the same role as the He 343 A-3, differing in terms of the armament used, having an upgraded rear turret arrangement that necessitated the redesign of the tail unit.

The Air Ministry reviewed Heinkel&#x27;s proposal, as well as a competing design produced by Junkers. While the Air Ministry did place an initial order for 20 aircraft, which included the prototype and pre-production units. The company&#x27;s founder, Ernst Heinkel, personally lobbied in favour of the project, pointing to its simplicity, lower material cost, and more rapid development schedule. It was claimed that as many as 200 He 343s could be supplied by July 1945. The DFS designated the project &quot;P.1068&quot;. However, during late 1944, Heinkel was ordered to stop all work on the programme and the order was cancelled. This outcome came as a consequence of Germany&#x27;s deteriorating position in the conflict and to refocus limited resources onto efforts such as the Emergency Fighter Program. The aviation author Daniel Uziel claimed that German authorities had probably wanted Heinkel to concentrate on producing the Heinkel He 162 fighter instead.

While no aircraft were ever completed, much of the design work had been completed and a substantial amount of components for the project had already been produced. The incomplete airframes and components were initially stored by Heinkel in the hope that the project would be resumed. As the conflict approached its conclusion in 1945, the Allied powers sought to obtain whatever technical information that could be recovered from Nazi Germany, particularly on its advanced military projects and aerospace initiatives. The Soviet Union succeeded in acquiring much of the He 343&#x27;s design and components from Heinkel&#x27;s facility in Schwechat, outside Vienna. Thereafter, it is alleged that the project served as the basis for the development of the Ilyushin Il-22, albeit with some of the parameters being altered, such as the size and crew numbers. A single prototype was built and flown. The results of these tests were used in development of the Ilyushin Il-28.

<doc id="1279126" wikidata="Q5036528" url="?curid=1279126" title="Captain Action">
<text>Captain Action was an action figure created in 1966, equipped with a wardrobe of costumes and facial masks allowing him to become Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Captain America, Aquaman, the Phantom, The Lone Ranger (and Tonto), Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Sgt. Fury, Steve Canyon, and the Green Hornet. Captain Action was the Ideal Toy Company&#x27;s answer to Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe, although the protagonist dolls of both toy lines were created and designed by the same toy-and-idea man, Stan Weston. Captain Action also had a working 4 foot (1.2192 meter) parachute.

==Historical overview==
Toy developer Stan Weston went to Hasbro&#x27;s Don Levine with the idea of an articulated doll in the form of a soldier — a basic figure, and with limitless accessories. Levine and his Hasbro team took the concept, making it into G.I. Joe, the first modern action figure for boys — and the first to carry the &quot;action figure&quot; generic name, an attempt to remove the term &quot;doll&quot; from a toy for boys. Weston took his money from the G.I. Joe venture and founded his own licensing company, representing DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and King Features Syndicate.

After the success of G.I. Joe, Stan Weston&#x27;s company, Leisure Concepts, then brought the idea of a new, articulated, twelve-inch (305 mm) action figure to Ideal Toys Corporation, who were seeking an action figure of their own, to remain competitive in the toy market. Weston proposed &quot;Captain Magic&quot;, a many-in-one hero, who could adopt the guise of several heroes, all of whom Leisure Concepts represented. The name was changed to &quot;Captain Action&quot;, and first marketed by Ideal in 1966.

The figure itself had a rather sad and worried expression, a strange shaped head (so the masks of the various heroes would better stay in place over it) and a more detailed musculature than G.I. Joe&#x27;s. The original Ideal base for the line was Captain Action in his blue and black uniform, with lightning sword and ray gun included in the box. Separate Superman, Batman, Lone Ranger, The Phantom, Flash Gordon, Captain America, Sgt Fury, Steve Canyon and Aquaman costumes (with accessories) were available; the next wave (1967) added Spider-Man, Buck Rogers, the Green Hornet, and Tonto, with a Blue Lone Ranger variation (matching the still popular Clayton Moore series) and collectible flicker rings in each box. Sgt. Fury was dropped from the line in the second wave.

In 1967, Captain Action proved popular enough to expand the line by adding a partner and an enemy. Action Boy had a similar costume to Captain Action that was red, blue and black. Separate uniform sets available for Action Boy were Robin, Superboy and Aqualad. Dr. Evil, a blue skinned alien with large bug eyes and an exposed brain, wearing a modified Nehru suit and sandals. Ideal did not create any villain costumes for Dr. Evil.

A vehicle called the &quot;Silver Streak&quot;, a amphibian car with missile launchers, was added, large enough for both the Captain and sidekick. Several sets meant to be used by Captain Action in his Captain Action identity were designed for the character as well: a four foot working parachute, a jet mortar, a jet pack, a weapons arsenal, and several other secret weapons to add to the Action Cave, which the special box for the Streak could convert into. Both the Captain and Dr. Evil received &quot;secret lairs&quot;, which doubled as carrying cases for the figures, but which are now quite rare. All of this was an attempt by Ideal to build the &quot;Action&quot; line and focus on Captain Action as a hero in his own right, rather than just a base figure for other heroes.

A line of female figures was also released called the &quot;Super Queens Posin&#x27; Dolls&quot;, which featured Batgirl, Mera, Supergirl, and Wonder Woman figures. Unlike Captain Action and Action Boy, the Super Queens dolls were each individually based on a singular superheroine (instead of a base &quot;Super Queen&quot; doll with interchangeable outfits).

After just a couple of years, the Captain Action line declined in sales. As a result, Ideal Toys discontinued it in 1968. Though Captain Action was produced for only two and a half years, the characters and accessories have become amongst the most fondly remembered, and expensive to obtain on the collector&#x27;s market, action figures of the era.

Throughout the 1970s, Captain Action leftover uniforms and boots were used on knock-off, blow-molded figures from China (where the original was cast and assembled) and Ideal itself reused the original body molds to rush a Star Wars-like toy to the market, the Knight of Darkness, in 1977. Captain Action collectors would buy the figure (cast in black plastic) often using the hands to replace the sometimes missing hands of the vintage figures.

===Captain Action returns===
After 30 years off the market, Captain Action was revived in 1998, by retro toy company Playing Mantis. In addition to Captain Action and Dr. Evil, costumes released boxed with Captain Action figure were The Lone Ranger (in red and black outfit), Tonto, Flash Gordon, his never-before-made nemesis Ming the Merciless (with a new flesh-tone Dr. Evil figure), The Green Hornet, and his never-before-made sidekick Kato. The line met with lackluster sales, and carded costumes-only were issued separately: Green Hornet, Kato, Lone Ranger (in blue outfit), Tonto, The Phantom, and his never-before-made enemy Kabai Singh. Also revived was Action Boy (now called Kid Action, due to Hasbro owning the rights to the name Action Man) and retro long box packaging for Captain Action and Dr. Evil. The changes made little difference in the general sales and the second coming of Captain Action ended in 2000.

===2000s–2010s===
Since 2005 Captain Action Enterprises holds the licensing rights and has been producing an array of new merchandise, including statues, toys, comics, trading cards, collectibles and apparel.

In March 2011, Round 2 Corp. and Captain Action Enterprises announced plans for a redesigned 1/6 scale Captain Action figure.

==In other media==
=== Comic books ===
==== DC Comics ====
National Periodical (DC Comics) licensed the character from Ideal and published five issues of &quot;Captain Action&quot; in 1968, illustrated at first by Wally Wood, then by Gil Kane. The scripts were by a teenage Jim Shooter and Gil Kane. A 2006 interview with Shooter reveals the unpromising setup of the comic:

The comic book storyline had little to do with the toy concept, as some of the heroes licensed for use as costumes for the Captain Action doll were not owned and published by DC (Spider-Man and Captain America for example, were Marvel Comics characters), therefore the ability to change into different characters was entirely dropped. Instead, Captain Action came to possess magical coins, each of which provided him with a spectacular power from a Greek, Roman, or Norse mythological god (in a similar way to the original Captain Marvel). Captain Action was given a real name of his own, Clive Arno, and was identified as a widowed archaeologist and museum curator, and was described as having located &quot;the coins of power&quot; in a buried city. Action Boy&#x27;s comic-book alter-ego was Carl Arno, son of Clive. Dr. Evil was given a back-story too, having been Captain Action&#x27;s father-in-law, then going mad in a mishap. The series lasted five issues, until July 1969.

In the early 1980s, writer Mike Tiefenbacher wrote a story proposal that would have revived Captain Action and Action Boy as &quot;Captain Triumph&quot; and &quot;Javelin&quot; in the &quot;Whatever Happened To...?&quot; backup feature in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;. DC Comics rejected the idea due to copyright concerns regarding the characters.
Issue #5 of the &quot;Captain Action&quot; comic book series, retitled &#x27;Thrills and Adventure&#x27;, was used as a prop in the &#x27;It&#x27;s the Arts&#x27; episode of Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus.

==== Moonstone Books ====
In 2008 Moonstone Books began a new series and created a new back-story for the character. Captain Action was now Miles Drake, a former Marine who discovers a cache of alien weaponry during the Vietnam War. The weapons are connected to a race of alien parasites called the Red Crawl, who have been taking over world leaders in a bid to dominate the earth. The Red Crawl&#x27;s main representative on earth is Dr. Eville (based on Dr. Evil from the Ideal toy line). Drake becomes an agent of the A.C.T.I.O.N. Directorate, a secret agency operating outside the government and dedicated to defending earth from the alien menace. The name of the organization is an acronym for &quot;Advanced Command for Telluric Interdiction Observation and Nullification&quot;. Eventually, the A.C.T.I.O.N. directorate is able to use the alien technology to create superheroes and the Red Crawl is apparently defeated. The series also tell the story of a second Captain Action, Miles&#x27;s rebellious son, Cole Drake, who inherits the heroic identity in the 21st century. It is revealed that the Red Crawl was never actually defeated and that the superheroic Protectors are actually under their control. Cole must struggle against the renewed alien menace and the rogue superheroes. The stories of the original Captain Action are told in the 1960s where the character is a costumed super spy. The identity-changing aspect of the toy line shows up in Captain Action&#x27;s ability to use a material called &quot;plastiderm&quot; to disguise himself as almost anyone. In the modern stories the younger Captain Action uses the more advanced &quot;plasmaderm&quot; which allows him not only to assume someone&#x27;s likeness, but any powers they possess. Thus Captain Action is finally able to change into other superheroes, though this only works for original characters like Savior rather than for licensed characters like Superman. The exception to this has been a crossover adventure with the Phantom whose adventures Moonstone was also publishing.

Moonstone has featured a similarly revised Action Boy. In this version he is Sean Barrett, the son of a famous naturalist whose identity is assumed by Dr. Eville. His stories also take place in the 1960s. Moonstone has also created an original character, Lady Action, who works for the British branch of the A.C.T.I.O.N. Directorate. Both Action Boy and the newly introduced Lady Action (AKA Nicola Sinclair), have been featured as back up stories in the Captain Action comic. Lady Action also debuted in a one shot comic of her own in 2010, and continues to play a pivotal role in the Captain Action ongoing Series.

Moonstone Books published a new Captain Action comic book from 2008 to 2010, with the initial six-issue arc written by Fabian Nicieza. A &quot;Captain Action Special&quot; was also released in 2010 as well as a two-issue miniseries teaming up Captain Action with the Phantom, written by Mike Bullock. In July 2010, &quot;Captain Action Season 2&quot;, an ongoing series written by Steven Grant, debuted that lasted 3 issues. Moonstone planned on releasing &quot;Captain Action: Classified&quot;, which would tell stories of Captain Action&#x27;s earliest adventures in the 1960s, but this did not happen.

Instead, in 2013 Dynamite Entertainment put out a mini-series with Captain Action called &quot;Codename: Action&quot; that included several pulp and comic book characters in an origin story for Captain Action.

=== Games ===
In 2016 Small Monsters Games developed and released the Captain Action card game. This is an all-ages casual game including art from classic comics artists Jerry Ordway, Kerry Callen, and Paul Gulacy. The game was designed by Meg Stivison.

=== Books and novels ===
In 2010, the coffee table book &quot;Captain Action: the Original Super Hero Action Figure&quot;, by Michael Eury, was published by TwoMorrows Publishing.

In July 2012, an original Captain Action pulp novel was released by Airship 27, called &quot;Captain Action: Riddle of the Glowing Men&quot;, written by Jim Beard.

A second novel by Jim Beard titled &quot;Hearts of the Rising Sun&quot; was released in 2014 by Airship 27.

A novel featuring Lady Action — &quot;The Sands of Forever&quot; — by Ron Fortier was released by Airship 27 in 2015.

A third Captain Action novel titled &quot;Cry of the Jungle Lord&quot;, written by Jim Beard and Barry Reese, was released by Airship 27 in 2017.

<text>St. James was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1892 to 1952.

The riding was created in 1892 from parts of Montreal Centre and Montreal East ridings. It consisted initially of St. James&#x27;s Ward and the East Ward in the city of Montreal. In 1914, it was expanded to include Lafontaine Ward of the city of Montreal. After 1924, it was defined with reference to streets in Montreal.

In 1947, the riding was abolished when it was redistributed into a new St. James riding, and the ridings of Lafontaine, Laurier, Papineau and St. Mary.

The new St. James electoral district was abolished in 1952 when it was redistributed into Laurier and Saint-Jacques ridings.

<doc id="1279140" wikidata="Q5196213" url="?curid=1279140" title="Cushman Dam No. 1">
<text>Cushman Dam No. 1 is a hydroelectric dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River in Mason County, Washington, which in derogation of the natural and treaty rights of the Native inhabitants impounded and enlarged the formerly natural Lake Cushman, leading to damage claims in excess of $5 billion and an eventual settlement agreement with the Skokomish tribe that terminates the right to operate the dam(s) after 2048. It was built by Tacoma City Light (now Tacoma Power) in 1924–1926. Tacoma&#x27;s demand for electricity grew rapidly after World War I. Tacoma City Light&#x27;s Nisqually River Hydroelectric Project, built in 1912, could not meet the demand and the utility decided to build a new hydroelectric project on the North Fork Skokomish River. The dam and powerhouse first began to deliver electricity on February 12, 1926.

It has a concrete arch design and includes 90,000 cubic yards (69,000 m³) of concrete, covering a whole of water. Two 21,600 kilowatt generators provide 127 million kilowatt-hours annually to the Tacoma Power system.

Construction began on July 7, 1924, under the commissioner Ira S. Davidsson (1918–1940). It has a top width of and a base width of , at high and long. The transmission of electricity to Tacoma, over lines crossing Tacoma Narrows, was activated, or &quot;formally energized&quot;, on March 23, 1926, with the push of a button by President Calvin Coolidge in a ceremony at the White House.

A second, smaller dam, Cushman Dam No. 2, downstream of Dam No. 1, was completed by December 1930.

<doc id="1279150" wikidata="Q972525" url="?curid=1279150" title="Prince Planet">
<text>Prince Planet is the English-language title given to one of the earliest anime television series, , when it was transmitted on American television in the United States in the mid-1960s. It did run on &quot;The Works&quot; television network before it ceased operations February 28, 2017. A 52-episode monochrome anime series, it tells the story of a member of the Universal Peace Corps, originally from the planet Radion, coming to Earth on a mission to determine if this world meets standards for membership in the Galactic Union of Worlds and assist its inhabitants during his stay. While on his mission, Prince Planet adopts the identity of an Earth boy named Bobby and gains comrades who work together alongside him fighting forces of evil, both alien and terrestrial.

==Production overview and history==
&quot;Prince Planet&quot; was originally produced by TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan, now Eiken) and aired on the Fuji Television network in June 1965. The show was one of the first heavily merchandised shows in Japan, with simple things like shoes getting the &quot;Planet Boy Papi&quot; logo. An English-dubbed version was released by American International Television Productions in September 1966, and produced by James Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. The dubbing was performed in Miami at Copri Films International and directed by Mark Harris, with dialog scripting by Reuben Guberman, who also reworked &quot;The Amazing 3&quot; for Erika Productions in 1967 and developed the live-action &quot;tokusatsu&quot;-&quot;kaiju&quot; series &quot;Giant Robo&quot; for American television, later that same year, under the title &quot;Johnny Sokko And His Flying Robot.&quot; The American theme was composed by Guy Hemric and Jerry Styner, who had previously written songs for several of American International&#x27;s &quot;Beach Party&quot; movies. Glico was a major sponsor for the series and made Papi &quot;prizes&quot; that came in certain candy products. Prizes included mini action figures and play jewelry.

==Main characters==

===Prince Planet, allies, and enemies===
The main characters appearing throughout most of the series are all introduced by the fourth episode. In episode 1, Prince Planet arrives on Earth and meets a girl, Riko or Diana Worthy in the English-dubbed version and her father, Pops Worthy, who live on a large ranch. In episode 2, a wrestler known as Dan Dynamo, billed as &quot;The strongest man in the world,&quot; joins the Prince Planet team. Episode 3 introduces Warlock, who is said to be the &quot;Master of Martian Magic,&quot; although his Martian origins seem to be more of a contrivance added to the English dub; whatever Warlock&#x27;s origin, he is established as a student of some kind of magical school who runs away to Earth after being punished for getting drunk on prune juice. The last major team member is a magician named AjiBaba of Abbadon, from the desert of the eastern hemisphere who debuts in episode 4 as an arch-enemy of Warlock, who attacked his country. Many of the episodes involve battles with Warlock until episode 30, when Krag from the planet Kragmire banishes (throws) Warlock into the depths of space and becomes Prince Planet&#x27;s major nemesis until the end of the series. Warlock finally returns in the second-to-last episode of the series.

===Human guise and transformation===
While on Earth, Prince Planet exists usually as Bobby, a normal boy, but when the need arises he will transform into Prince Planet to fight enemies or protect his friends. He transforms similarly to Shazam by holding his pendant with both hands and saying &quot;Peeeeeee Pazow!!&quot; with the &quot;Pazow&quot; being added to cover the Japanese &quot;Papi.&quot; When Bobby is transformed into Prince Planet, an appropriate suit of battle armor comes with the transformation, armor which resembles the apparel worn by the people of his native world. This includes a helmet, which all male members of Radion society seem to wear.

===The super-humanoid powers of Prince Planet===
Prince Planet&#x27;s main powers are not altogether unlike those of Superman, and in the original Japanese, his home world is named &quot;the .&quot; His pendant-endowed powers include super strength, flight, and resistance to harsh environments like outer space, though he can be injured in his transformed state. Prince Planet can also use his superior intellect (in several episodes, he is said to have an IQ of 200) along with the energy of the pendant to transform material objects at will; this power is very useful to create needed weapons, transportation, or other devices.

====The power pendant of Prince Planet====
A recurring plot element of many episodes hinges on a limitation resembling that of the Green Lantern of DC Comics, in that his pendant needs to be recharged periodically, 24 hours for the Green Lantern and an entire week for Prince Planet. But unlike the Green Lantern, Prince Planet cannot perform this task himself. Instead, replenishment of the pendant&#x27;s energy is handled from the planet Radion. As his energy supply diminishes, the &quot;P&quot; in his pendant goes from black to white like a thermometer in dropping temperatures.

On Prince Planet&#x27;s home planet of Radion, in the &quot;power tower,&quot; there is a person whose job is to monitor the pendant&#x27;s energy level and ensure that it does not run too low. Not surprisingly in view of this plot element, the custodian of the Radion power tower often appears to be &quot;asleep on the job&quot; while Earth and Prince Planet are hanging in the balance, and he sends energy to the pendant at the last possible second before disaster. Even whenever he has been completely deprived of the pendant&#x27;s power, however, Prince Planet can still, physically, put up a good fight, and his high intellect makes him a cunning and formidable opponent.

==Other foreign releases and dubs==
&quot;Prince Planet&quot; was televised in Australia and aired in Melbourne in March 1967 on Channel 9 at 5pm weekdays. The series was well known in Australia. It last appeared on Australian television in 1974 on the &quot;Super Flying Fun Show,&quot; a weekday breakfast television series.

In Brazil, &quot;Prince Planet&quot; aired between 1970 and 1975. The characters were known by the following names:
*Diana Worthy - &quot;Estrellita&quot;
*Dan Dynamo - &quot;Bruno Retti&quot; or &quot;Strong&quot;
*Warlock - &quot;Capirote&quot;
*Krag - &quot;Kilitrone&quot;

==Reception==
Two factors contributed to the hasty demise of &quot;Prince Planet&quot; as a desirable property for domestic broadcast, one being the fact that monochrome programing was becoming less desirable to television stations with the ever-growing popularity of color television. The other was negative parental reaction to cartoons that contained what was perceived as excessive violence for children&#x27;s television. Whilst he was fighting for right, Prince Planet&#x27;s opponents were often killed when they faced off against him, and this was obvious even despite editing of the dubbed prints to remove violent scenes. Prince Planet kills Warlock and Krag in the last two episodes before returning home to Radion, and they were not the only villains he blasted away with his pendant.

In addition to human violence, the Prince was not overly sensitive to Earth fauna either. For instance, in one episode, he transformed a whale into transportation for his friends, effectively killing the whale. Even so, &quot;Prince Planet&quot; is known to have been televised in the U.S.A until around 1976 in the Chicago area (WSNS-TV Channel 44) on stations hungry for afternoon TV for children to watch after school, and the program claimed many faithful adherents throughout the sixties and those later years. It was also televised on WUTV channel 29 Buffalo, New York, in the summer of 1975.

==Home video==
TGG Direct released a 5-disc box set containing 47 of the 52 episodes of the series on July 15, 2014 on Region 1 DVD.

<doc id="1279157" wikidata="Q2045675" url="?curid=1279157" title="Belz Voivodeship">
<text>Bełz Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland from 1462 to the Partitions of Poland in 1772–1795. Together with the Ruthenian Voivodeship it was part of Red Ruthenia, Lesser Poland Province. The voivodeship was created by King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk, and had four senators in the Senate of the Commonwealth (the Voivode and the Castellan of Bełz, as well as Castellans of Lubaczów and Busk).

==History==
Bełz Voivodeship was formed in 1462 from the territories of the Duchy of Belz, after the Duchy was annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of the voivodeship:

“Belz, on the Zaloka river, was one of the oldest gords of the Czerwien Land. In 981, the province was seized by Vladimir the Great. Recovered by Bolesław Chrobry in 1018, it again became part of Rus’ after Chrobry’s death (...) In the early 14th century, the Land of Belz was inherited by Boleslaw Jerzy II of Mazovia, who in 1331 married Eufemia, the daughter of Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas and sister of Aldona of Lithuania, wife of Casimir III the Great. Boleslaw Jerzy died on April 7, 1340, and after his death, King Casimir seized Red Ruthenia together with Land of Belz (...) In 1387, King Wladyslaw Jagiello allowed his sister Alexandra of Lithuania to marry Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, giving her as dowry the Land of Belz. The province remained in the hands of sons and grandsons of Siemowit IV. The grandsons died childless in early 1462, and the Land of Belz became property of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, during the reign of King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk.

The newly created Belz Voivodeship was slightly smaller than Lublin Voivodeship at approximately the same size as the Chełm Land. It was made of three counties: Lubaczów, Horodło and Szewlock, and in 1767, it was divided into the counties of Bełz, Grabowiec, Horodło, Lubaczów, and the Land of Busk. At local sejmiks in Belz, five deputies to the Sejm were elected, and the voivodeship had four starostas: Belz, Busk, Grabowiec and Horodlo (...) In the 17th century, the voivodeship, which was the smaller of all Lesser Poland voivodeships, had 483 villages and 33 towns (...) After the first partition of Poland (1772), almost whole voivodeship was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Galicia. What remained in Poland were towns of Dubienka and Korytnica, together with some villages (...) In 1793 the voivodeship ceased to exist, as after the second partition of Poland, its remaining parts were annexed by the newly created Chełm Voivodeship and Włodzimierz Voivodeship&quot;.

The area received an influx of szlachta from Mazovia, Lesser Poland and Greater Poland. In 1570–1580, 79% of the local noble families (among those of known provenance) was of Polish origin, while the percentage of Ruthenian and Wallachian noble families amounted to 15% and 4% respectively. Peasant strata of the population remained the least affected by migrations from the west.

<doc id="1279163" wikidata="Q6942365" url="?curid=1279163" title="Music and dances of the Federated States of Micronesia">
<text>The traditional music of the Federated States of Micronesia varies widely across the four states, and has, in recent times, evolved into popular music influenced by Europop, country music and reggae.

==Traditional dances==
Traditional dances on the main islands includes &quot;stick dancing&quot; on Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap, standing dances on Chuuk and sitting dances on Yap and Chuuk. The Yapese are particularly known for their skills in dancing. The Yapese stick dance is performed by men, women and children together, while standing dances are performed either by women or men and boys, but never both together. The men participate in various dancing competitions, which are segregated by caste; the lower castes have some distinct dances, such as a woman&#x27;s standing dance, but can only dance when authorized by a person of a higher caste. Chuuk shares many of the similar dance styles with Yap because of similar cultural heritage with Chuuk and the outer islands of Yap. Chuuk&#x27;s most mysterious and rarest dance is called the &quot;Moonlight Dance&quot;, one of the few dances in which both men and women dance together. It can only happen during a full moon with permission of the village chief. Traditionally speaking, this was a way for young males and females to get together.

<text>PMMP is a Finnish pop rock band fronted by singers Paula Vesala and Mira Luoti and backed by musicians Mikko Virta, Juho Vehmanen and Heikki Kytölä. The name of the band is often said to be an abbreviation of the sentence &quot;Paulan ja Miran Molemmat Puolet&quot;, which can be translated in English as &quot;Both Sides of Paula and Mira&quot;. However, in an interview on the Finnish talk show Krisse Show, they stated that the name of the band comes, like ABBA, from the names of 4 of its members: so PMMP is Paula, Mira, Mira, Paula. PMMP&#x27;s albums were produced by former Thergothon drummer Jori Sjöroos, who also wrote the music for all the songs. The lyrics are written by Paula and Mira. The band is an acclaimed live act.

PMMP first became well known in Finland with the 2003 summer hit &quot;Rusketusraidat&quot; (&quot;&quot;Tan Lines&quot;). They then enjoyed great success with their second album &quot;Kovemmat kädet&quot; (&quot;Rougher Hands&quot;), which sold gold (double platinum year 2010). An extended version of the album was released in August 2005. &quot;Oo siellä jossain mun&quot;, a single from the aforementioned album, is PMMP&#x27;s biggest hit so far in Finland.

In November 2006 PMMP released their third album &quot;Leskiäidin tyttäret&quot; (&quot;Daughters of a widow mother&quot;), which sold platinum on the day it was released.

They released an album labeled &quot;Puuhevonen&quot; (&quot;Wooden Horse&quot;) with traditional children&#x27;s songs in 2007, around the time their first children were born. In 2009 they released their fourth rock/pop album &quot;Veden varaan&quot; (&quot;Overboard&quot;) and their fifth album &quot;Rakkaudesta&quot; (&quot;Of Love&quot;&quot;), released in 2012, is considered as their comeback album.

PMMP played their final concert on October 27, 2013, in the sold-out Helsinki Ice Hall.

On 11 September 2023, PMMP announced a reunion after 10 years, with the first show at Helsinki Olympic Stadium on 24 August 2024.

==&quot;Matka jatkuu vaan&quot; – The Journey Continues==
In an article titled &quot;Matka jatkuu vaan&quot; in the biggest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (17.2.2007), journalist Leena Virtanen attempts to explain how it is that PMMP appeal to both children and adults, concluding that while indeed an energetic pop band PMMP &quot;live within the space between childhood and adulthood&quot;, referring to the lifeworlds of both children and adults, carried through with eternal optimism. Virtanen concludes with the words from one of PMMP&#x27;s best known songs &quot;Matkalaulu&quot; (travel song), which is in fact a song about the band being on the road: &quot;Tämä voi olla koko elämämme ihanin päivä. Ajetaan hiljempaa. Toivon, että matka jatkuu, jatkuu vaan&quot; [This could be the most wonderful day of our whole life. Let&#x27;s drive slower. I hope the journey goes on, goes on and on...&quot;]

==Activism==
PMMP has supported Amnesty International&#x27;s work against the violence towards women. The song &quot;Joku raja&quot; from the album &quot;Leskiäidin tyttäret&quot; is named after Amnesty&#x27;s campaign by the same name.

On 25 May 2013 PMMP was supposed to perform together with two members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot at the Maailma kylässä (World Village) festival in Helsinki. The members of Pussy Riot had disappeared and PMMP performed without them but supported their cause for human rights in Russia.

Following that event, after 10 years of performing, the group disbanded.

<doc id="1279194" wikidata="Q2918381" url="?curid=1279194" title="Islam in Yemen">
<text>Islam in [[Yemen]] dates back to about 630 AD, when it was introduced by Ali who finalized the conquest of it when Muhammad was still alive. It was during this period that the mosques in Janad (near Ta&#x27;izz) and the Great Mosque of Sana&#x27;a were built. Yemenis are divided into two principal Islamic religious groups: 65% Sunni and 35% Shia. Others put the numbers of Shias at 30%. The denominations are as follows: 65% primarily of the Shafi&#x27;i and other orders of Sunni Islam. 33% of the Zaidi order of Shia Islam, 2% of the Ja&#x27;fari and Tayyibi Ismaili orders of Shia Islam. Yemen is home to the Sulaymani Bohra community, a subdivision of Tayyibi Mustali Ismailism. The Sunnis are predominantly in the south and southeast. The Zaidis are predominantly in the north and northwest whilst the Jafaris are in the main centres of the North such as Sana&#x27;a and Ma&#x27;rib. There are mixed communities in the larger cities. 

According to WIN/Gallup International polls, Yemen has the most religious population among Arab countries and it has one of the most religious populations world-wide.

==History==
==Population==
The Zaidis of the northern highlands dominated politics and cultural life in northern Yemen for centuries; with Unification of Yemen, and the addition of the south’s almost totally Sunni Muslim population, the numerical balance has shifted dramatically away from the Zaidis. Nevertheless, Zaidis are still over represented in the government and, in particular, in the former North Yemeni units within the armed forces. 

Houthi authorities in Sana’a formally enacted new regulations on the collection and use of zakat, the Islamic obligation for individuals to donate a portion of their wealth each year to charitable causes. The executive bylaw, signed by Mehdi al-Mashat, president of the Houthi-run Supreme Political Council (SPC), imposes a &quot;khums&quot; tax (literally meaning “one-fifth”, or 20 percent) on economic activities involving natural resources in areas under the group’s control in Yemen, which includes most of northern Yemen where some 70 percent of the population lives.

==Society==
Public schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions, although Muslim citizens are allowed to attend private schools that do not teach Islam. In an effort to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools, the government does not permit any courses outside the officially approved curriculum to be taught in private and national schools. Because the government is concerned that unlicensed religious schools deviate from formal educational rirements and promote militant ideology, it has closed more than 4,500 of these institutions and deported foreign students studying there.

<text>This is a list of [[state park]]s and reserves in the [[Virginia]] state park system.

Virginia opened its entire state park system on 15 June 1936 as a six-park system. The six original state parks were Seashore State Park (now First Landing State Park), Westmoreland State Park, Staunton River State Park, Douthat State Park, Fairy Stone State Park, and Hungry Mother State Park. The park system now oversees 43 parks.

<text>Tacoma Power is a public utility providing electrical power to Tacoma, Washington and the surrounding areas. Tacoma Power serves the cities of Tacoma, University Place, Fircrest, and Fife, and also provides service to parts of Steilacoom, Lakewood, and unincorporated Pierce County. It is a division of the Tacoma Public Utilities and owns the Click! Network, developed by Steven Klein, Tacoma Power&#x27;s former superintendent.

==History==
In 1884, Charles B. Wright was granted the exclusive right to create Tacoma&#x27;s first power and water company, incorporating the Tacoma Light and Water Company. Wright&#x27;s system drew water from Tule and Spanaway Lakes and Clover Creek. The water was transported to the city through a 10-mile wooden flume that emptied into an in-town reservoir. The flume was mostly uncovered and attracted thirsty cows and children in search of a good wading pool. This led to the spread of disease.

Tacoma City Light was created in 1893 when the citizens of Tacoma voted to buy the privately owned Tacoma Light &amp; Water Company to ensure its safety and longevity. Its first independent power generation came with the construction of LaGrande Dam on the Nisqually River, 36 miles away from the city, producing hydroelectric power as of November, 1912.

In 2011, Tacoma Power received the first-ever Award for Excellence in Energy Efficiency from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The award recognizes Tacoma Power&#x27;s &quot;exceptional creativity, leadership and achievement in the pursuit of energy efficiency.&quot; The utility competed against other utilities and organizations served by BPA in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.

<doc id="1279212" wikidata="Q893045" url="?curid=1279212" title="Boomwhacker">
<text>A Boomwhacker is a percussion instrument in the plosive aerophone and idiophone family. They are lightweight, hollow, color-coded, plastic tubes, tuned to a musical pitch by length. They were first produced by Craig Ramsell through his company Whacky Music in 1995. The term is now a registered trademark by Rhythm Band Instruments.

== History ==
Boomwhackers evolved at a time when junk bands and performers using instruments made from recycled materials were popular. Bands often used gas pipes or various cast-offs from plumbers that were cut to length to produce different pitches when struck on an open end. Schools, meanwhile, created their own junk bands as a cheap way to simultaneously promote creativity and encourage recycling. However, creating a custom kit was labor-intensive, leaving a niche for Boomwhackers, which are premade and mass-produced.

American Craig Ramsell reportedly came up with the idea for his Boomwhackers in 1994 while at home recovering from radiation therapy. While cutting cardboard tubes into shorter lengths for recycling, he noticed the different pitches resulting from the different lengths and decided to investigate their creative potential. He experimented with various plastics before settling on plastic mailing tubes. He and his wife, Monnie Ramsell, formed DrumSpirit as a sole proprietorship to market the tubes. The original plastic Boomwhackers were first produced in 1995. The current, more durable version was released in 1997.

Craig Ramsell then started Whacky Music, Inc. in 1998, marketing a wider variety of Boomwhacker sets and materials. Boomwhackers are now available to span 3½ chromatic octaves. (The addition of the Octavator Tube Caps in 1999 allowed for the third lower octave.)

In July 2009, the Sedona, Arizona-based Whacky Music, Inc., sold its interests to Rhythm Band Instruments LLC of Fort Worth, Texas, through an asset purchase agreement. Rhythm Band now distributes and owns the trademark to Boomwhackers.

== Sound production ==
Boomwhackers produce musical tones through vibrations in the instrument when struck. The pitch of the instrument is determined by the length of the tube. The longer a tube is, the lower its pitch; the shorter a tube is, the higher the pitch. When one end of a Boomwhackers tube is covered with what the manufacturer calls an &quot;Octavator Cap&quot;, the pitch it produces is lowered by an octave. They are most commonly hit with a hand, against the floor, or on other parts of the human body. They can also be grouped together and struck with mallets in different configurations using specialized holders (either homemade or available from the manufacturer), similar to a horizontally-aligned xylophone.

== Usage ==
Boomwhackers are most commonly used in elementary music classrooms as an inexpensive alternative or supplement to traditional pitched instruments such as xylophones and metallophones. Students are usually given a distinctly pitched tube, such as F or A. Educators then instruct players of certain pitches to strike the Boomwhacker at a precise time, forming a melody. Boomwhackers are often used by performance artists and other musical performance groups to add an element of spectacle. They can also be used by people with intellectual and developmental impairment to develop sensorimotor skills, social skills, and creativity.

<text>Jocelyn Louise Burdick (&quot;née&quot; Birch; February 6, 1922 – December 26, 2019) was an American politician from North Dakota who briefly served as a member of the United States Senate in 1992. She was the first woman from the state to hold this office. At the age of 97, she was the oldest living former U.S. Senator for the last eight months of her life. She was a member of the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party.

== Early life and education ==
Burdick was born in Fargo, North Dakota, the daughter of Magdalena Towers (Carpenter) and Albert Birch. Her great-grandmother was suffragist and abolitionist Matilda Joslyn Gage. Burdick was the great-niece, by marriage, of L. Frank Baum, the author of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, who was married to her great-aunt, activist Maud Gage Baum. She was educated at Principia College and at Northwestern University.

== Early career ==
Prior to her second marriage to Senator Quentin N. Burdick, she was a Republican, but changed her affiliation after the marriage. However, she asserted that she had done it out of her own volition. She would occasionally act as a stand-in for him at speeches, but would make no attempt to interpret his policies or stands.

After graduating from Northwestern, Burdick returned to Fargo working as a radio announcer at KVOX radio. Burdick was engaged in civics throughout her marriage to Quentin Burdick. She was part of the official U.S. delegation to Russia in 1978 and she was a trustee to the Lake Agassiz Arts Council. Burdick helped to found the Democratic Women Plus in the early 1980s. She also recorded public service announcements against drunk driving and drug use in 1989.

==U.S. Senate==
Upon the death of her husband, Senator Quentin Burdick in September 1992, Jocelyn Burdick was appointed by Governor George Sinner to fill the vacancy in his position until a special election was held. She had been reluctant to fill the vacancy, but agreed to do it for the opportunity to cast some votes her husband would have wanted. She did not run as a candidate for election to the rest of the term. During her brief tenure in office, Burdick supported legislation on pay equity and women&#x27;s rights. After Kent Conrad took office in December 1992, Burdick retired to Fargo.

Burdick was the first woman from North Dakota to serve in either house of the U.S. Congress. She lived in Fargo, where she remained active in politics. In April 2019, she became the oldest living former U.S. senator following the death of Fritz Hollings.

==Personal life and death==
Burdick was a devout Christian Scientist. Burdick&#x27;s first husband was Kenneth Peterson. She had two children, daughter Leslie and son Birch, with Peterson. Peterson died in 1958 of a heart attack. Two years later she married Quentin Burdick, who was a widower himself with four children. With Quentin she had another son, Gage. Gage died in 1978 from an accident with an electric belt sander. Burdick died in Fargo on December 26, 2019, at the age of 97.

Her son Birch Burdick served as Cass County State Attorney between 1998 and 2022.

<doc id="1279227" wikidata="Q1911630" url="?curid=1279227" title="To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)">
<text>&quot;To Serve Man&quot; is the 24th episode of the third season of the anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and the 89th overall. It originally aired on March 2, 1962, on CBS. Based on Damon Knight&#x27;s 1950 short story of the same title, the episode was written by Rod Serling and directed by Richard L. Bare. It is considered one of the best episodes from the series, particularly for its final twist.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A man named Michael Chambers lies on a cot in an otherwise empty, locked room. He grimly refuses a meal when it is offered to him by a voice on a loudspeaker, then begins to reflect on the circumstances that have led him into this situation.

The setting changes to several months earlier, on Earth. The Kanamits, a race of aliens, land on Earth as the planet is beset by international crises. As the Secretary-General of the United Nations announces the landing at a news conference, one of the aliens arrives and addresses the assembled delegates and journalists using an artificially created voice. He states that his race&#x27;s motive in coming to Earth is to provide humanitarian aid by sharing their advanced technology that can easily and inexpensively solve all energy and food shortages and prevent international warfare. After answering questions, the Kanamit departs without comment and leaves behind a book in his language; Chambers, a cryptographer working for the United States government, is pressed into service to decipher it.

International leaders express wariness of the Kanamits&#x27; uninvited arrival on Earth, but start to believe their claims of benevolence upon seeing their advanced technology at work. Patty, a member of Chambers&#x27; staff, translates the title of the book as &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, further bolstering public trust in the Kanamits. One member of the race submits to polygraph-monitored interrogation and is determined to be telling the truth.

The Kanamits deliver on their promise to turn the world into a Utopia, transforming barren deserts into productive agricultural land, and each nation is given an impenetrable force field that leads to the virtual disbandment of all militaries. Humans soon begin volunteering to travel to the Kanamits&#x27; home planet, which is described as a paradise, and the Kanamits set up embassies in every country on Earth and weigh all passengers boarding their ships. Even though Chambers&#x27; staff no longer have any real work to do, due to worldwide declarations of peace and the dissolution of the United States Armed Forces, Patty continues her efforts to decode the Kanamits&#x27; book, while Chambers decides to simply enjoy the newfound paradise and signs up for his own trip to the Kanamits&#x27; planet.

Some time later, as Chambers is boarding a Kanamit ship, Patty pushes through the waiting line and shouts for him not to go. She has successfully translated &quot;To Serve Man&quot; and discovered that it is not a book about humanitarian aid, but a cookbook. Chambers tries to flee, but a guard forces him onto the ship and closes the hatch so it can lift off.

In the present, a meal is delivered to Chambers through a small aperture in the wall and he angrily throws it across the room. A Kanamit picks up the food and encourages him to eat so that he will not lose weight. Chambers addresses the viewers directly to ask whether they have left Earth yet and remarking that the Kanamits will eventually cook and eat all of humanity. He then begins to eat his meal, ending his hunger strike and thus surrendering to the Kanamits.

==Critical response==
&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the episode at number 11 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot; and ranked the ending as the &quot;Greatest Twist of All Time&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; listed the episode among the &quot;Top 10 Twilight Zone Episodes&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the episode first on its list of the &quot;25 Best Twilight Zone Episodes&quot;.

==Cultural influence==
The episode is occasionally referenced in popular culture, usually with the line &quot;It&#x27;s a cookbook!&quot; or some variation thereof. References or parodies can be found in such television series as &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;; movies such as &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot;, and &quot;Madagascar&quot; (&quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; featured a tongue-in-cheek cameo by Lloyd Bochner, who played Michael Chambers in the &quot;TZ&quot; episode); the comic strip &quot;Mark Trail&quot;; and musical works by artists Nuclear Assault, Cattle Decapitation, Mono Puff, and El-P. A reference to the episode has even found its way into an unofficial emblem for a United States Air Force unit.

==Sequel==
The 2020 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; final episode &quot;You Might Also Like&quot; by Oz Perkins serves as a thematic sequel to &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, featuring the Kanamits, who are still learning about Earth&#x27;s culture to plot further evil.

<doc id="1279228" wikidata="Q2972861" url="?curid=1279228" title="Nickel (Canadian coin)">
<text>The Canadian five-cent coin, commonly called a nickel, is a coin worth five cents or one-twentieth of a Canadian dollar. It was patterned on the corresponding coin in the neighbouring United States. It became the smallest-valued coin in the currency upon the discontinuation of the penny in 2013. 

==History==

The &quot;Victory nickel&quot;, struck from 1943 to 1945, was the first non-standard circulating Canadian coin other than commemorative dollars; the reverse features a flaming torch and a large V that stands for both Victory and the coin&#x27;s denomination. The rim denticles were replaced by the phrase &quot;We win when we work willingly&quot; in Morse Code. This design was re-used in 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of V-E Day. Almost uniquely in the history of Canadian coinage, the reverse was engraved to scale by Thomas Shingles; most coin designs are engraved at a much larger scale and reduced with a pantograph.

In 1951, a special commemorative five-cent piece depicting a nickel refinery was struck to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the metal&#x27;s initial discovery by Swedish chemist Axel F. Cronstedt. Due to the onset of the Korean War, production of this commemorative was halted to preserve nickel for the war effort, resulting in a second non-commemorative 1951 &quot;nickel&quot; made of plated steel.

In 1967, all the circulating coins received a special reverse for the Canadian Centennial; the nickel featured a rabbit.

In proof sets issued since 1996, the five cent coin is made of sterling silver. Some commemorative five cent coins are also made of sterling silver.

==Collecting==
According to author Allen G. Berman, Canadian nickels struck in pure nickel are &quot;very difficult to grade&quot; due to the alloy&#x27;s hardness. Five-cent coins dated 1921 are among the rarest and most collectible Canadian circulation coins, known as &quot;the Prince of Canadian Coins.&quot; Estimates of the number of specimens known range between 400 and 480. In May 1921, the government of Canada passed an act authorizing the change to the larger nickel coin, and subsequently the majority of the 1921 mint run was melted down. The coin believed to be the finest-known specimen (PCGS MS-67) sold for at auction in January 2010. It was then sold by the Canadian Numismatic Company for $160,000 to a private collector in early 2012.

<doc id="1279236" wikidata="Q3014697" url="?curid=1279236" title="Daniel Snyder">
<text>Daniel Marc Snyder (born November 23, 1964) is an American businessman and former owner of the Washington Commanders, an American football franchise belonging to the National Football League (NFL). He bought the team, then known as the Redskins, from the estate of Jack Kent Cooke in 1999. Snyder is widely considered one of the worst owners in the history of North American professional sports, with the team managing only six playoff appearances and two playoff wins during his 24 years of ownership.

Snyder&#x27;s ownership of the team was marred by the enablement of a toxic workplace culture, as well as financial improprieties such as withholding security deposits from season ticket holders and paying hush money to accusers. Growing pressure from other NFL owners, amid investigations by the U.S. Congress and other government agencies, led him to sell the team to an investment group headed by Josh Harris for $6.05 billion ($5.99 billion after an NFL-imposed $60 million fine at the time of sale), the largest transaction ever for a sports franchise. Snyder has resided in London since the early 2020s.

==Early life==
Snyder was born on November 23, 1964, in Silver Spring, Maryland. The son of Arlette (née Amsellem) and Gerald Snyder, he was raised in a Jewish household with his brother Zack Snyder. His father was a freelance writer who wrote for United Press International and &quot;National Geographic&quot;. At age 12, he moved to Henley-on-Thames, a small town near London, where he attended private school. At age 14, he returned to the United States and lived with his grandmother in Queens, New York. A year later, his family moved to Rockville, Maryland, where Snyder graduated from Charles W. Woodward High School.

His first job was at a B. Dalton bookstore in White Flint Mall. By age 20, he had dropped out of the University of Maryland, College Park and was running his own business, leasing jets to fly college students to spring break in Fort Lauderdale and the Caribbean. Snyder claimed to have earned US$1 million running the business with a friend out of his parents&#x27; apartment.

Snyder courted real estate entrepreneur Mortimer Zuckerman, whose &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; was also interested in the college market and who agreed to finance his push to publish &quot;Campus USA&quot;, a magazine for college students. Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, co-publisher of Zuckerman&#x27;s &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, invested $3 million in &quot;Campus USA&quot;. The venture closed after two years.

==Career==

In 1989, Snyder and his sister Michele founded Snyder Communications, an advertising company with seed money from their father. They concentrated on wallboards in doctors&#x27; offices and colleges. They combined the advertisements with the distribution of product samples, such as soaps and packages of medicine, to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Snyder continued to expand its activities to different aspects of outsourced marketing. In 1992, the company expanded into telemarketing with a focus on the immigrant market. Revenues rose from $2.7 million in 1991 to $9 million in 1993.

Snyder became the youngest CEO of a New York Stock Exchange listed company at the age of 32 when it underwent an initial public offering in September 1996. His top investors, including media mogul Barry Diller and Robert Strauss, earned significant returns on their initial investment. Mortimer Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, whom Snyder owed $3 million from the failure of his first business venture, were given company stock, which ended up being worth over $500 million. His parents sold their stock in the company for over $60 million.

He continued to expand the company through a string of acquisitions, such as Arnold Worldwide in 1997. By 1998, the company had over 12,000 employees and $1 billion in annual revenues. In April 2000, Snyder Communications was sold to the French advertising and marketing services group Havas in an all-stock transaction valued at in excess of US$2 billion. Snyder&#x27;s personal share of the proceeds was estimated to be US$300 million.

===Washington Redskins / Football Team / Commanders ownership (1999–2023)===

In May 1999, Snyder purchased the Washington Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium for $800 million following the death of previous owner Jack Kent Cooke. At the time, it was the most expensive transaction in sporting history. The deal was financed largely through borrowed money, including $340 million borrowed from Société Générale and $155 million debt assumed on the stadium. To pay down the team&#x27;s debt, in 2003, he sold 15 percent of the team to real estate developer Dwight Schar for $200 million, 15 percent to Florida financier Robert Rothman for a like amount; and 5 percent to FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith, leaving him with a 65 percent ownership interest. In 2020, Snyder blocked the minority owners from selling their combined 35 percent ownership stake to an outside party by exercising his right of first refusal, only offering to buy back the 20 percent held by Rothman and Smith but not the 15 percent owned by Schar.

In March 2021, after a period of litigation, the league approved Snyder for a debt waiver of $450 million to acquire the remaining ownership stake held by the three in a deal worth approximately $875 million. Due to financial issues and increasing pressure from the NFL and other parties, he hired BofA Securities to explore possible sale transactions in November 2022. Snyder began negotiating with a group led by private equity investor Josh Harris in April 2023, with an agreement being reached in May to sell the franchise for $6.05 billion, the highest price ever for a sports team. The deal was unanimously approved by other NFL owners on July 20, 2023, and closed a day later. He formerly served on the NFL&#x27;s broadcast, business ventures, digital media, international, stadium, and Hall of Fame committees.

==Other ventures==
Snyder owned expansion rights to an Arena Football League team for the Washington, D.C., market before the 2009 demise of the original league. He purchased the rights to the team for $4 million in 1999. The team was going to be called the Washington Warriors and play their games at the Comcast Center in 2003 but the team never started.

In 2005, he bought 12% of the stock of amusement park operator Six Flags through his private equity company RedZone Capital. He later gained control of the board, placing his friend and ESPN executive Mark Shapiro as CEO and himself as chairman. In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Six Flags&#x27; stock as it had fallen below the minimal market capitalization. In June 2009, Six Flags announced that the company was delaying a $15 million debt payment and two weeks later, Six Flags filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of the reorganization, 92% of the company ended up in the hands of their lenders with Snyder and Shapiro being removed from their positions.

In July 2006, Snyder launched Red Zebra Broadcasting with the purchase of a trio of sports radio stations in Washington, D.C. He purchased three other radio stations in the mid-Atlantic region, and broadcast coverage of Washington Redskins games on all of his stations. In 2017 and 2018, Red Zebra sold off all of its radio stations and ceased doing business.

Also in July 2006, Snyder and other investors signed a deal to provide financing to the production company run by Tom Cruise and his partner, Paula Wagner. This came one week after Paramount Pictures severed its ties with Cruise and Wagner. Snyder is credited as an executive producer for the 2008 movie &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, which starred Cruise.

In February 2007, it was announced that Snyder&#x27;s private equity firm Red Zone Capital Management would purchase Johnny Rockets, the 1950s-themed diner chain. RedZone Capital Management sold the company to Sun Capital Partners in 2013. From 2007 to 2012, Snyder also owned entertainment company Dick Clark Productions.

Snyder is a backer of the film production company Kinematics, which was founded by filmmaker Mark H. Rapaport. The production company financed the 2024 film &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, which is a portrayal of Donald Trump early in his business and real estate career in New York City. According to ESPN sources, Snyder invested in the film believing it would portray Trump favorably. When the film was screened in his home in February 2024, Snyder reportedly became upset about the negative portrayal of Trump. The film was shelved before Kinematics sold its stake in the film in the summer of 2024.

==Reception and controversies==
Snyder is widely considered to be one of the worst owners in the history of North American professional sports. Under his ownership, the team had a regular season record of 164–220–2 with a post-season record of 2–6, never reaching past the Divisional Round. The media alleged that his managerial style and workplace culture directly affected the team&#x27;s performance during his tenure as the principal owner. In reflecting on Snyder in 2025, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to him as &quot;largely forgotten&quot;, while Snyder reportedly was said that he &quot;f------ hates it&quot; when asked about what he felt about seeing Washington win games without him in the 2024 NFL season, in which they made their first NFC Championship Game appearance since the 1991 season, 8 years before Snyder bought the team. 

Under Snyder, the team sued season ticket holders who were unable to pay during the Great Recession in the late 2000s, despite his claim that there were over 200,000 people on the season ticket waiting list. Partway through the 2009 season, Snyder temporarily banned all signs from FedExField, leading to further fan discontentment. Fans also expressed discontentment about the game day experience, rising ticket and parking prices, and Snyder&#x27;s policy of charging fans for tailgates in special areas of the stadium lot. A 2023 survey conducted by the NFL Players Association ranked Washington as the worst team to play for, with the lowest grades for their team facilities and lack of accommodations for the players and their families.

===Redskins name===

In May 2013, in response to a question regarding the team&#x27;s federal trademark, Snyder told the &quot;USA Today&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ll never change the name. It&#x27;s that simple. NEVER—you can use caps.&quot; Snyder refused to meet with Native American advocates for a name change. A pitched public relations battle in 2013 and 2014 led Snyder to employ crisis management and PR firms in an effort to defend the name. Snyder&#x27;s creation of the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation in 2014 was seen by some activists as a disingenuous effort to buy favor from Native American communities.

Following renewed attention to questions of racial justice in wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020, a letter signed by 87 shareholders and investors was sent to team and league sponsors Nike, FedEx, and PepsiCo urging them to cut their ties unless the name was changed. Around the same time, several retail companies had begun removing Redskins merchandise from their stores. In response, the team underwent a review in July 2020 and announced they would be retiring the name, with a new name and logo to be chosen at a later date. As a team rebranding process usually takes over a year, the team temporarily played as the Washington Football Team for the 2020 and 2021 seasons. The name was changed to the Commanders in 2022.

===Defamation suit===
Threatening a lawsuit in January 2011, Snyder demanded the dismissal of sports writer Dave McKenna, who had written an article for the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; titled &quot;The Cranky Redskins Fan&#x27;s Guide to Dan Snyder&quot;, creating a list of controversies involving Snyder. McKenna had been needling Snyder for years in his columns, and the front-page of the article had a defaced picture of Snyder with devil&#x27;s horns and a beard, an image Snyder claimed was antisemitic. Other sportswriters have come out in support of McKenna. In a statement released by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, while acknowledging that public figures are fair game for criticism, said the artwork used by the &quot;City Paper&quot; was reminiscent of &quot;virulent anti-Semitism going back to the Middle Ages&quot; and urged the &quot;City Paper&quot; issue an apology. Mike Madden of the &quot;City Paper&quot; issued a statement saying they take accusations of antisemitism very seriously and said the artwork was meant to &quot;resemble the type of scribbling that teenagers everywhere have been using to deface photos&quot; and the cover art was not an antisemitic caricature. In February, Snyder filed a lawsuit against the &quot;City Paper&quot; before dropping it in September.

===Environmental===
In 2004, Snyder brokered a deal with the National Park Service to remove old growth trees from the of national parkland behind his home to grant him a better view of the Potomac River, on the condition that Snyder would replace the trees with 600 native saplings. Lenn Harley, a real estate broker who was not involved in Snyder&#x27;s purchase of the estate but was familiar with the area, estimated that the relatively unobstructed view of the river and its surroundings that resulted from Snyder&#x27;s clearing could add $500,000 to $1 million to his $10 million home&#x27;s value. The clearcutting was started without approval from Montgomery County, Maryland, and without environmental assessments, as required by law. As a result, Snyder was fined $100 by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in December 2004. Snyder&#x27;s neighbors also filed complaints regarding his clearcutting of scenic and historic easements behind his home.

The NPS ranger who investigated the complaints of Snyder&#x27;s neighbors and clearcutting along the Potomac was transferred multiple times due to his continued pursuit of the complaints and the Snyder property. Eventually, the NPS ranger filed a whistleblower complaint regarding the Snyder case. Later, the ranger&#x27;s anonymity as a whistleblower was lost, potentially leading to extreme harassment and a trial of the park ranger, ultimately ending the ranger&#x27;s career.

===Workplace culture===
In July 2020, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a series of articles alleging that over 40 women who were former employees of the organization, including office workers and cheerleaders, had been sexually harassed and discriminated against by Snyder and other male executives, colleagues, and players of the team since at least 2006. That December, it was also reported that Snyder had settled a sexual harassment claim with a former female employee for a sum of $1.6 million. The alleged incident had occurred on his private plane while returning from the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2009. Two private investigations at the time, hired by the team and an outside law firm, failed to substantiate the woman&#x27;s claim, and it was reported that Snyder paid the sum to avoid any negative publicity. A year-long independent investigation into the team&#x27;s workplace culture, led by lawyer Beth Wilkinson, was concluded in July 2021. It found that incidents of sexual harassment, bullying, and intimidation were commonplace throughout the organization under his ownership. The NFL fined the team $10 million in response, with Snyder also voluntarily stepping down from running the team&#x27;s day-to-day operations for a few months, giving those responsibilities to his wife Tanya Snyder.

On July 28, 2022, Snyder voluntarily testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform regarding its own investigation on Washington&#x27;s history of workplace misconduct. Following a 14-month probe, the Oversight and Reform committee published a report in December 2022 that found that Snyder gave &quot;misleading&quot; answers when he testified about his team&#x27;s workplace issues. The report also accused Snyder of paying former employees hush money so they would not come forward with their allegations of abuse, which included &quot;sexual misconduct, exploitation of women, bullying of men, and other inappropriate behavior,&quot; describing it as &quot;commonplace, and that he was a hands-on owner who had a role in nearly every organizational decision.&quot; The report also stated the NFL &quot;has not protected workers from sexual harassment and abuse.&quot; Former cheerleader Melanie Coburn testified before Congress that she was sexually harassed up to 200 times during her employment with the team, with a former video production manager for the team testifying that Snyder requested that lewd footage of a cheerleader photo shoot, without their consent, be compiled into a video. Snyder was also alleged to have hired private investigators to gather damaging information on team and NFL employees, including commissioner Roger Goodell and other team owners.

===Financial improprieties===
In 2021, the U.S. House Oversight Committee looked into reports that Snyder may have under reported ticket sales to the league, a move that would have allowed him to keep more ticket revenue. On April 12, 2022, the Committee sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission alleging Snyder had been keeping two separate financial ledgers since at least 2012: one that he would submit to the NFL and one that showed the actual numbers, which were much different. Congress also alleged that Snyder would drive up prices by selling cheaper tickets in bulk to third-party vendors, causing the remaining tickets to become far more expensive. This would in turn force fans who wanted to attend games at FedExField to either join an expensive waiting list or buy expensive tickets.

A criminal inquiry by the Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia alleged that Snyder possibly committed bank fraud after learning he was granted a $55 million line of credit in November 2018 without the knowledge and permission of the team&#x27;s board of directors. In February 2023, a federal grand jury issued subpoenas for a cache of documents related to the team&#x27;s finances.

In October 2022, attorney general of Washington, D.C. Karl Racine filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Snyder and the NFL. The criminal inquiry began after the US House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission detailing that it had found evidence of deceptive business practices over the span of more than a decade, including withholding ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable deposits from fans.

A $55 million loan became the primary focus of federal prosecutors, which initially was discovered as a footnote in an April 2020 financial report. The team had taken out the credit line 16 months earlier without the knowledge and required approval of Snyder&#x27;s minority partners, Robert Rothman, Dwight Schar, and Frederick W. Smith, who owned 40% of the team collectively. Bank of America officials repeatedly asked team executives for proof that the board had approved the loan, but team executives ignored all requests before the loan closed. According to arbitration documents, the partners demanded that the NFL investigate the origin of Snyder&#x27;s loan, yet neither NFL commissioner Roger Goodell nor the NFL arbitrator investigated the allegations. Four days after the partners asked the NFL to seek proof that the loan was legally obtained, the NFL shut down arbitration proceedings.

==Personal life==

In 1994, Snyder married Tanya Ivey, a former fashion model from Atlanta. She is a national spokesperson for breast cancer awareness and was named co-CEO of the team in 2021. They have three children and live in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2001, Snyder had surgery to remove a cancerous thyroid gland. In November 2022, Snyder incorporated a private limited company in London that listed his residency in England.

Snyder contributed $1 million to help the victims of the September 11 attacks and donated $600,000 to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. He paid shipping costs for charitable food shipments to aid those affected by the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia and Thailand. In 2016 following Hurricane Matthew, Snyder dispatched his private plane to provide emergency supplies in the Bahamas and medical supplies to Hospital Bernard Mevs in Port-au-Prince.

In 2000, Snyder founded the Washington Redskins Charitable Foundation. Snyder has been a long-time supporter of Youth For Tomorrow, an organization founded by former Redskins head coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe Gibbs. In April 2010, the organization presented Snyder with its Distinguished Leader Award. In 2005, Snyder was inducted as a member of the Greater Washington Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. Snyder owns a private plane, a Bombardier BD-700 Global Express XRS.

In 2014, Snyder formed the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation to provide opportunities and resources to aid Tribal communities. The foundation was formed to address the challenges in the daily lives of Native Americans. Snyder has also supported Children&#x27;s National Hospital, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and other organizations. In May 2014, Snyder and Tanya received the Charles B. Wang International Children&#x27;s Award from the NCMEC. He contributed $100,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign and $300,000 to humanitarian aid organizations for people affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In 2024, Snyder donated his 30,000 sq. ft. mansion, known as River House, to the American Cancer Society (ACS). The property, which Snyder had purchased from the estate of King Hussein and Queen Noor of Jordan in 2001, had been on the market for over a year with an initial asking price of $49 million before being reduced to $34.9 million. The ACS plans to sell the property and use the proceeds to support its mission of improving the lives of cancer patients and their families.

<text>Marie Rudisill (March 13, 1911 – November 3, 2006), also known as the Fruitcake Lady, was a writer and television personality, best known as the nonagenarian woman who appeared in the &quot;Ask the Fruitcake Lady&quot; segments on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on American television. She was an aunt to novelist Truman Capote (his mother, Lillie Mae Faulk, was her elder sister). Rudisill helped to raise Capote, who lived with her at times during his childhood, both in Alabama and New York City.

==Biography==
Rudisill was born Edna Marie Faulk in Monroeville, Alabama. Her first marriage, to a Japanese man in the 1930s, ended in divorce due to her family&#x27;s disapproval. She later wrote, &quot;I really loved that man. He was so talented and such a sweet wonderful person. And I would have been happier with him than I was with the man I married after that.&quot; She married James Rudisill in 1939. She wrote, &quot;A man who drinks excessively, it&#x27;s not a happy marriage. We loved each other, but we had our times.&quot; The couple had one son, James, and Rudisill had three grandchildren.

Rudisill authored eight books, including &quot;Fruitcake: Memories of Truman Capote &amp; Sook&quot;. She was a resident of Florida.

== &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; ==

Rudisill&#x27;s book &quot;Fruitcake&quot; (published by Hill Street Press) led to her being invited to be a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on December 14, 2000. During her first visit she showed Jay Leno and Tom Cruise how to make fruitcakes. This led to her being named the Fruitcake Lady and to several more appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, in which she instructed host Jay Leno and other guests in the preparation of various baked desserts.

In 2002, the &quot;Ask the Fruitcake Lady&quot; segments became a regular part of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In these segments, viewers posed prerecorded questions to Rudisill (including questions of a graphic sexual nature), and her frank and often unpredictable responses were shown. She often lost patience with what she perceived as stupidity on the part of some questioners, and lapsed into profanity.

== Death ==

Marie Rudisill died in Hudson, Florida, on November 3, 2006, at the age of 95, just before the publication date of her last book, &quot;Ask the Fruitcake Lady: Everything You Would Already Know If You Had Any Sense&quot;, on November 7. The November 8 broadcast of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; included a tribute composed of highlights from her segments on the show, including one in which she cooked with (and was hugged and kissed on the cheek by) Tom Cruise.

An updated version of her 1989 cookbook, &quot;Sook&#x27;s Cookbook: Memories and Traditional Recipes from the Deep South,&quot; was published by Louisiana State University Press in September 2008.

<text>Sheila Frahm (née Sloan; born March 22, 1945) is an American politician who served in the United States Senate as a Republican from Kansas for a brief period in 1996.

==Life and career==
Frahm was born in Colby, Kansas. In 1979, she served as a member of the town school board. She was appointed to the Kansas state Board of Education in 1985 and was re-elected in 1986. In 1988, she was appointed to the position of vice-president. Frahm was a member of the Kansas State Senate from 1989 to 1995. She became the first woman to be given the title of majority leader of the Kansas Senate when she was elected in 1993. Frahm was the 44th Lieutenant Governor of Kansas from 1995 to 1996. While serving as lieutenant governor, Frahm also served as the state&#x27;s Secretary of Administration.

On May 16, 1996, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, announced that he would resign from the Senate to focus all of his time on his presidential campaign, stating that he would formally leave by June 11. Eight days later, Governor Bill Graves announced that he would appoint Frahm to replace Dole. On June 11, Dole resigned and Frahm was sworn in. During her time in the Senate, Frahm voted with the Republican Party 92.9% of the time. The Senate average was 87.5%. Around the time she was sworn in as Senator, she labeled herself as &quot;traditionally conservative...very tight-fisted, very prudent. That&#x27;s what Kansas is.&quot;

Frahm ran in the Republican special primary on August 6 to serve Dole&#x27;s remaining two years of his term, where she immediately ran into competition in first-term U.S. Representative Sam Brownback (who had asked Graves to appoint him but was rejected). He campaigned in favor of banning legal abortion and a constitutional amendment allowing school prayer, each of which Frahm opposed. Frahn received just 41% of the vote; Brownback went on to win the November 1996 special general election, taking office two days after winning. Frahm was the first appointed senator to lose a party primary since Maryon Pittman Allen in 1978 and the last until Luther Strange did so in 2017.

==Other==
Frahm is an Honorary Chair of Women for Kansas. She moved back to Colby, Kansas, and became the executive director of the Kansas Association of Community College Trustees. For the 2018 gubernatorial election, Frahm joined many other high-profile Republican current and former legislators and politicians in endorsing the Democratic nominee, and eventual victor, Laura Kelly. Frahm endorsed Kelly again in her successful 2022 reelection bid.

<text>Assiniboia is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was first created for the 1879 provincial election, was eliminated in 1888, and was re-established in 1903. It is located in the westernmost tip of the City of Winnipeg.

Assiniboia is bordered on the east by St. James and Lakeside, to the south by Kirkfield Park, to the north by Lakeside, and to the west by Morris.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,441. In 1999, the average family income was $53,881, and the unemployment rate was 6.50%. Retail trade accounts for 15% of the riding&#x27;s industry.

Until 1920, Assiniboia was a marginal riding between the Manitoba Liberal Party and Conservative Party. Between 1920 and 1949, it was a hotly contested riding between the Conservatives and candidates of the Independent Labour Party and Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).

The riding was dominated by the Liberals from 1949 until 1977, and then by the Progressive Conservatives from 1977 to 1999. The New Democratic Party of Manitoba&#x27;s (NDP) victory in 1999 was completely unexpected, and occurred by a margin of only three votes.

The NDP took the seat in the 2023 Manitoba general election.

<doc id="1279276" wikidata="Q449445" url="?curid=1279276" title="Nikolaos Plastiras">
<text>Nikolaos Plastiras (; 4 November 1883 – 26 July 1953) was a Greek general and politician, who served three times as Prime Minister of Greece. A distinguished soldier known for his personal bravery, he became famous as &quot;The Black Rider&quot; during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, where he commanded the 5/42 Evzone Regiment. After the Greek defeat in the war, along with other Venizelist officers he launched the 11 September 1922 Revolution that deposed King Constantine I of Greece and his government. The military-led government ruled until January 1924, when power was handed over to an elected National Assembly, which later declared the Second Hellenic Republic. In the interwar period, Plastiras remained a devoted Venizelist and republican. Trying to avert the rise of the royalist People&#x27;s Party and the restoration of the monarchy, he led two coup attempts in 1933 and 1935, both of which failed, forcing him to exile in France.

During the Axis Occupation of Greece in the Second World War he was the nominal leader of the EDES resistance group, although he remained in exile in Marseilles. After the occupation, he returned to Greece and served as a centrist Prime Minister three times, often in coalition with the Liberal Party. In his last two governments, he tried to heal the rift caused in Greek society by the Greek Civil War, but was unsuccessful.

== Early life ==
He was born in 1883, in Karditsa, Greece. Plastiras&#x27; parents were originally from Morfovouni (formerly Vounesi), a village in the Agrafa mountains of southwestern Thessaly. The municipality was renamed for General Plastiras and Morfovouni is the present capital of Plastiras Municipality. The family moved to Karditsa before Plastiras was born.

== Military career ==

After finishing school in Karditsa, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment as a volunteer in 1904. He fought in the Macedonian Struggle, and participated in the military coup of 1909. He entered the NCO School in 1910 and, after being assigned to the rank 2nd lieutenant in 1912, he fought with distinction in the Balkan Wars, where he earned his nickname &quot;The Black Rider&quot;. He first rose to wider prominence when, as a major, he supported the Movement of National Defence of Eleftherios Venizelos during the First World War. He fought with distinction with the Archipelago Division at the battle of Skra-di-Legen and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1919, Plastiras commanded the 5/42 Evzone Regiment in the Ukraine, as part of an Allied force aiding the White Army in their ultimately unsuccessful fight against the Red Army. His force was then transferred to Smyrna in Asia Minor via Romania. After the change in power in Greece (November 1920) and the return of king Constantine, he was the only officer, who had participated in the National Defence movement, who was not dismissed from the army. The men of his Regiment warned that they wouldn&#x27;t fight under another commander.

During the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922, the Turks called Plastiras &quot;Kara Biber&quot; (&quot;The Black Pepper&quot;), while the 5/42 Regiment of Evzones became known as the &quot;Şeytanın Askerleri&quot; (&quot;Satan&#x27;s Army&quot;). Soon after, at the battle of Sakarya, the Greeks were forced to begin their retreat.

After the Turkish breakthrough in August 1922, his unit have been ordered to counterattack at Kamelar mountain to regain Greek&#x27;s positions. He didn&#x27;t try on 13 August, but he did try and failed the following day. For this failure he was accused to be responsible for the 4th Greek Infantry Division destruction, supposed to get accusations on a court marshal. His unit, 5/42 Evzones Regiment, was among others withdrawing orderly to the coast, fighting off superior Turkish forces and having serious casualties. The remnants of the Hellenic Army made their way to the islands of the Eastern Aegean.

===September 1922 Revolution===

The Army&#x27;s resentment at the political leadership in Athens resulted in the outbreak of the 11 September 1922 Revolution, led by Plastiras, Colonel Stylianos Gonatas and Commander Phokas.

Having the support of the Army and much of the people, the revolutionary officers quickly entered Athens and assumed control of the country. He is reported by Penelope Delta, witness of the events, to have said to the crowd: &quot;Why do you cheer? We lost, we came destroyed&quot;.

Plastiras forced King Constantine I to abdicate, called upon the exiled Venizelos to lead the negotiations with Turkey which culminated in the Treaty of Lausanne, and set about to reorganize the Army of Thrace against any Turkish advance (eastern Thrace was still in Greek hands). One of the most controversial acts of the revolutionary government was the trial and execution of five royalist politicians, including former PM Dimitrios Gounaris, and the former Commander-in-Chief, General Georgios Hatzianestis, on 28 November 1922 as those mainly responsible for the Asia Minor Disaster, in the infamous &quot;Trial of the Six&quot;.

Plastiras faced multiple challenges in governing Greece. The 1.3 million refugees from the population exchange had to be catered for in a country with a ruined economy, internationally isolated and internally divided. The Corfu incident, and a botched Royalist coup in October 1923 were evidence of this. After the failed royalist coup, King George II was forced to leave the country. Nonetheless, he managed to restore some order to the state and to lay the groundwork for the Second Hellenic Republic. After the elections of December 1923 for the new National Assembly, he resigned from the army on 2 January 1924, retiring to private life. In recognition of his services to the country, the National Assembly declared him &quot;worthy of the fatherland&quot; and conferred to him the rank of lieutenant general in retirement.

Plastiras was even admired by his greatest enemy, Mustafa Kemal. At the end of the war, during the negotiations that took place regarding the exchange of populations between Greece and the newly formed Republic of Turkey, Atatürk is quoted telling Plastiras, &quot;I gave gold and you gave me copper.&quot;

== Political career ==
The Republic that he had helped found proved an unstable one. Coups, counter-coups, the conflict between Venizelists/Republicans and Royalists, and constant economic problems plagued Greece. Plastiras, persecuted during the Pangalos dictatorship, attempted to lead a coup in March 1933, after the anti-Venizelists won the elections, but facing universal reaction (even from Venizelos himself), he was forced to flee abroad. Finally, after the failed Venizelist revolt of 1935, although still abroad, he was condemned &quot;in absentia&quot; to death. Nonetheless he maintained a high prestige as a war hero and because of his integrity and staunch Republicanism.

He played a role in the creation of the EDES resistance group, whose titular leadership he had despite his will, after discussions with Komninos Pyromaglou.

He returned to Greece in 1945, after his selection as prime minister following the December events of 1944, primarily because he was a commonly accepted personality. Plastiras attempted to tread a middle path between the British, who were supporting the returned government-in-exile and the return of King George II, and the democratic-leftist guerilla of the EAM/ELAS. During his premiership, the Varkiza Agreement was signed. His moderate policies and republican sympathies earned the distrust of the British, and he was dismissed after only three months in office, when the Press published a letter of him during the war, proposing the German intervention to stop the Greco-Italian war.

In 1949, after the end of the Greek Civil War, Plastiras founded a new party, the Progressive Liberal Party which transformed into National Progressive Centre Union (&quot;Εθνική Προοδευτική Ένωση Κέντρου&quot;, EPEK) for the 1950 Greek legislative election, forming a following of disappointed Liberals and left-leaning democrats. He preached a message of national reconciliation, which put him in conflict with the conservative establishment which sought to punish those who had fought to establish a communist government. Together with Sofoklis Venizelos and George Papandreou, Plastiras formed a coalition government in 1950, which fell, however, when his partners retired. In the September 1951 elections, EPEK emerged as the strongest of the centrist parties. Plastiras formed a coalition government with Sofoklis Venizelos&#x27; Liberals, and attempted to address the great problems of the country. His government initiated the economic recovery and the reconstruction of Greece. A monument to this is the construction of the dam at the Tavropos (Megdovas) River to form a lake, a program that he initiated. The lake and dam, both formerly named Tavropos, now bear his name. His policy of conciliation, however, was bitterly assailed from the right, distrusted from the left, and undermined even by members of his own cabinet. A defining moment of his government was the conviction and execution of Nikos Belogiannis in March 1952 despite international protest. After losing the elections of November 1952, his political career, and with it the liberal &#x27;Centrist Intermission&#x27;, came to an end. He died in poverty in 1953 in Athens.

<doc id="1279280" wikidata="Q469823" url="?curid=1279280" title="Sato Kilman">
<text>Meltek Sato Kilman Livtuvanu (born 30 December 1957) is a Vanuatuan politician who served as the Prime Minister of Vanuatu on four previous occasions, most recently from 4 September to 6 October 2023. he was previously prime minister from December 2010 to April 2011, from May to June 2011 and June 2015 to February 2016, though his premiership was subsequently annulled by a court of law.

Kilman was elected prime minister again on 26 June 2011, thus beginning his first legally recognised term in the premiership; he served until 23 March 2013. He is also the Leader of the People&#x27;s Progress Party and an MP from Lakatoro on Malekula Island. On October 6, 2023, he was ousted by a vote of no confidence.

==Early life and police career==
Kilman was born on 30 December 1957. His home island is Malekula.

In 1977, Kilman joined the British Police Force in New Hebrides as a corporal. Following the independence of Vanuatu in 1980, he underwent training with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. Kilman was appointed commander of the Vanuatu Mobile Forces in 1984 and assistant commissioner of the Vanuatu Police Force in 1986. He was promoted to police commissioner in 1992, but was dismissed the following year and controversially replaced with a political appointee who had a criminal record. He subsequently pursued business interests in the logging industry.

==Politics==

Kilman and Ham Lini led the opposition to the Serge Vohor government when it took office in July 2004. Lini soon joined a coalition government with Vohor as Kilman became the leader of the opposition and a particularly strong critic of Vohor&#x27;s attempts to establish relations with Taiwan. In December 2004, Kilman filed the no confidence motion which deposed Vohor and made Lini prime minister. In the new cabinet established on 13 December 2004, Kilman was rewarded by becoming Lini&#x27;s deputy, as well as taking the position of foreign minister.

Kilman was dismissed from the government in a cabinet reshuffle in late July 2007. According to the government, this was due to alleged fraud, involving money stolen from the government, in which Kilman&#x27;s political secretary was said to be involved.

Following the 2008 general election, the People&#x27;s Progress Party was in Opposition, as part of the Alliance bloc. In March 2009, Kilman was named leader of the Opposition, because the Alliance bloc had the largest number of seats of any Opposition party or alliance. In November 2009, in a major cabinet reshuffle, Kilman was brought into Natapei&#x27;s government as deputy prime minister.

===First terms as prime minister (2010–2013)===
On 2 December 2010 Kilman was appointed prime minister after Edward Natapei was ousted in a vote of no confidence. Kilman was himself narrowly ousted in a vote of no confidence on 24 April 2011 (Easter Sunday), by 26 votes to 25; Serge Vohor succeeded him.

Vohor&#x27;s election was declared invalid on 13 May 2011, as he only had a relative majority, and not an absolute one.

On 16 June, Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek ruled in a separate case put forward by Edward Natapei, contesting the constitutionality of Kilman&#x27;s initial election in December 2010. Lunabek ruled that Kilman&#x27;s election to office had indeed been unconstitutional, as &quot;[t]he speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman [had] appointed Mr Kilman prime minister without following article 41 of the constitution which required he be elected by secret ballot&quot;. Kilman&#x27;s premiership was annulled, and Natapei was restored as interim prime minister, instructed to convene Parliament for the election of a new prime minister. Ironically, as Natapei&#x27;s ministers were restored as interim ministers, Kilman reverted to being Natapei&#x27;s interim deputy prime minister - a position he was expected to hold only for a few days.

On 26 June, Kilman stood for the premiership, and was elected by Parliament, with 29 votes to Serge Vohor&#x27;s 23.

He retained the confidence of Parliament following the October 2012 general election, forming a broad coalition government.

On 20 March 2013, Minister for Justice and Social Welfare Thomas Laken and Minister for Ni-Vanuatu Business Marcellino Pipite crossed the floor to join the Opposition, along with six government backbenchers. Lacking a majority with which to govern, Kilman announced his resignation the following day, before a motion of no confidence could be brought against him. On 23 March, Parliament elected Moana Carcasses Kalosil to succeed him.

On 15 May 2014, Carcasses was ousted in a motion of no confidence. New Prime Minister Joe Natuman appointed Kilman his Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In early June 2015, Natuman sacked him for having said publicly that he could support a motion of no confidence against the government.

===Return to office===
On 11 June 2015, Kilman again became prime minister. He ousted Joe Natuman through a no-confidence vote, having been sacked as foreign minister by Natuman the previous week.

In October 2015, half of the MPs in Kilman&#x27;s government, including Deputy Prime Minister Moana Carcasses and several other ministers, were imprisoned for bribery. Kilman refused to comment publicly during the case, and allowed convicted MPs to remain in their positions as government ministers right up until the point of their imprisonment. His perceived lack of leadership during the crisis, and refusal to take responsibility for corruption within his government, was widely criticised and led to calls for his resignation.

On 4 September 2023, he returned as prime minister replacing Ishmael Kalsakau. Kilman told fellow MPs his top concern would be to &quot;review foreign policy so that it benefitted Vanuatu more&quot;, also seeking &quot;new export markets&quot;. The prime minister election came as a result of a political crisis, leading to former PM Kalsakau&#x27;s ousting &quot;for actions including signing a security pact with Australia&quot;.

<text>Belleplates is a brand name of a musical instrument of the percussion family and handbell sub-family. Consisting of a handle attached to a trapezoidal aluminium plate, struck by an attached hammer, they are something of a combination of handbells and handchimes. They are played with the same basic methods as handbells by teams or by individual players. Belleplates are manufactured by Belleplates, Ltd.

==History==

Belleplates were invented by Maurice Davies when he struck with his knuckles a piece of aluminium he had cut out to make something in his workshop, and was pleasantly surprised that it made a pleasant musical sound much like that of handbells. In March 2003 Belleplates Inc won Best Use of Innovation at the Best of Business Awards 2003. They subsequently went on to win the McNOOT Award at the Midlands Christian Resources Exhibition. McNOOT stands for &#x27;My Church Needs One of Those&#x27; and was judged by a panel of clergymen and church elders as the item in the show they would most like to take back to their parishes.

==Characteristics==
The instrument fills a gap in the market for a inexpensive, durable and lightweight handbell type instrument. Due to these qualities they have been used preferentially to handbells in schools and with elderly or disabled musicians.

Belleplates are not used as a professional instrument, however they blend with handbells and related instruments, allowing them to be used in a concert setting to provide a contrasting melody.
Belleplates are generally sold in sets of between 12 (1½ octaves diatonic) and 61 (5 chromatic octaves). Belleplates are made with coloured plastic handles; diatonic bellplates have white handles, and chromatic belleplates have black handles. This colour distinction, as used on Malmark handbells, makes it visually easier to pick up the correct note. They are packaged with clear plastic protective covers and stored in briefcases.

<doc id="1279286" wikidata="Q7039" url="?curid=1279286" title="Lahr">
<text>Lahr (officially Lahr/Schwarzwald since 30 September 1978) (); ) is a city in western Baden-Württemberg, Germany, approximately 50 km north of Freiburg im Breisgau, 40 km southeast of Strasbourg, and 95 km southwest of Karlsruhe. It is the second largest city in Ortenau (district) after Offenburg, and serves as an intermediate economic centre for the cities and towns of Ettenheim, Friesenheim, Kappel-Grafenhausen, Kippenheim, Mahlberg, Meißenheim, Ringsheim, Rust, Schuttertal, Schwanau and Seelbach.

The population of Lahr passed the 20,000 mark in the mid-1950s. When the new body of Municipal Law for Baden-Württemberg came into effect on April 1, 1956, the city was therefore immediately accorded &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot; status. In addition, Lahr cooperates with the town of Kippenheim in administrative matters.

==Geography==
Lahr is located on the western edge of the Black Forest where the Schutter Valley merges with the Upper Rhine River Plains from the east. The Schutter enters the city from the southeast and runs in a northwesterly direction first through the boroughs of Reichenbach and Kuhbach, then through Lahr (proper) where the &quot;Altstadt&quot; (historic town centre) is situated on the right bank of the river. It then traverses the borough of Dinglingen where it bends north until it finally leaves the city after traversing the borough of Hugsweier. A canal for emergency relief in times of flooding branches off from the Schutter not far from Dinglingen.

The city of Lahr is made up of Lahr (proper) and the formerly independent communities of Burgheim (merged with Lahr in 1899) and Dinglingen (merged in 1933). Burgheim and Dinglingen have merged with Lahr also in a geographic sense. During the last major district reform in Baden-Württemberg in the 1970s Hugsweier, Kippenheimweiler, Kuhbach, Langenwinkel, Mietersheim, Reichenbach and Sulz joined Lahr as new boroughs.

Several of the boroughs include additional, geographically distinct settlements or neighbourhoods that either have a long history of their own or were created as new developments but with areal boundaries that have not been officially defined. Most of these settlements have only small populations and some have since also merged with their borough in a geographic sense.

Specifically, &quot;Brudertal&quot; is part of the borough of Kuhbach; &quot;Galgenberg&quot;, &quot;Schutterlindenhof&quot; and &quot;Waldfrieden&quot; are part of Lahr (proper); &quot;Eichberg&quot;, &quot;Gereut&quot;, &quot;Giesenhof&quot;, &quot;Langeck&quot;, &quot;Poche&quot; and &quot;Schindelhöfe&quot; are part of the borough of Reichenbach; and &quot;Dammenmühle&quot;, &quot;Ernethof&quot;, &quot;Hohberg&quot; and &quot;Langenhard&quot; are part of the borough of Sulz.

===Neighbouring communities===
The following cities and towns share a border with Lahr. They are listed clockwise starting from the north: Friesenheim, Seelbach, Kippenheim, Kappel-Grafenhausen and Schwanau.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Oceanic climate).

==History==
===The city===
Lahr developed around the &quot;Storchenturm&quot; (&quot;stork tower&quot;) owned by the House of Geroldseck around 1220 and received a city charter around 1278. The charter was renewed in 1377 and served as the foundation for municipal independence through to the end of the Old Empire. The significant tax privileges enjoyed by Lahr allowed the city to quickly grow into a centre of trade during the eighteenth century.

The city and surrounding land with the same name remained the property of the Geroldsecks until 1426. Their successor was the House of Moers-Saarwerden, which gave half the land to Baden as collateral for loans and in 1497 legal ownership was transferred to it. The other half was transferred to the House of Nassau-Saarbrücken in 1522. Both Baden and the House of Nassau-Saarbrücken implemented the Reformation in the areas under their control and ruled the city jointly until the Baden half also became the property of the Nassaus in 1629.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War reduced the city&#x27;s population significantly and during the Dutch War in 1677 it was burned to the ground by French troops under the leadership of Marshall de Créquy. Later on, during the eighteenth century, the citizens of Lahr sued the House of Nassau in the &quot;Lahr Law Suits&quot; in 1726 and 1778. The suits were decided in favor of the citizens of Lahr and thwarted Nassau&#x27;s attempt at absolute rule.

In 1803 Lahr and the surrounding land in Baden became the seat of a court, whose areal boundaries were modified several times. During the 19th century Lahr was highly involved in the printing industry and the Burda Publishing Company, nowadays located in neighboring Offenburg, had its start at least partially in Lahr.

Between 1898 and 1919 and again between 1936 and 1945, the city was home to a garrison. After World War II, Lahr became one of the bases for the French until France left the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1966. After that, from 1967 until 1994, the Canadian NATO forces (CFB Lahr) maintained their European headquarters in Lahr. Following the closing down of the &quot;old&quot; Brigade Area in North Rhine-Westphalia centred around Iserlohn, Hemer, Deilinghofen as well as Werl and Soest (1970–1971)the Land Forces and their families were transferred to the Lahr area to join the existing Air Force contingent. On 6 May 1994, Werner Dietz, Mayor of Lahr/Schwarzenwald presented the Canadian Forces a plaque &quot;The City of Lahr/Schwarzenwald, in the Black Forest, thanks the Canadian Forces for their contribution to Peace, Security and harmonious relations between Canadian and German populations of our city during their presence from 1967 to 1994.&quot; After the Canadian Forces left in 1994, a small Canadian contingent of former civilian employees remained in Lahr (approximately 200).

As early as 1939 Lahr was the seat of the rural district of the same name. Its automobile license plates code was &quot;LR&quot; but during the Baden-Württemberg district reform in the 1970s the district was dissolved and its communities were assigned and made part of the newly created Ortenau District.

===The boroughs===
Lahr&#x27;s boroughs also enjoy a long history. Hugsweier, Burgheim, Dinglingen, Langenwinkel, Mietersheim and Sulz used to be ruled by the same rulers as Lahr itself and therefore shared a great deal of the city&#x27;s history. In 1803 they became part of Baden and were communities in a previous district of Lahr until they were merged and became part of the city.

&quot;Hugsweier&quot; was first mentioned in 1341 as &quot;Hugelswilre&quot;, &quot;Burgheim&quot; in 1035 as &quot;Burcheim&quot;, &quot;Dinglingen&quot; in 961 as &quot;Tuntelinga&quot;, &quot;Mietersheim&quot; in 762 as &quot;Mutherisheim&quot; and &quot;Sulz&quot; in 1270 as &quot;Sulz&quot;.

&quot;Langenwinkel&quot; is a village with a fairly short history. It was built starting in 1787 in the area of the Nassau forest, which was cut down to make room for the new village, on land that belonged to Dinglingen. In 1790 the first house was built and in 1797 Langenwinkel became an independent community that was also made part of Baden in 1803. After 1951 the airfield for the Canadian Forces was built in Langenwinkel&#x27;s immediate vicinity and the associated noise and traffic became a tremendous hardship for the residents of Langenwinkel. In 1965 the German Ministry of Defense decided therefore to move the village and Langenwinkel was recreated between 1968 and 1971 several kilometres southeast of the &quot;Hurster Hof&quot;.

&quot;Kippenheimweiler&quot; was first mentioned in 1427 as &quot;Wilre&quot; and then in 1462 as &quot;Kippenwiler&quot;. It was an extension of Kippenheim and like Kippenheim it became part of the Baden House of Mahlberg in 1629. In 1810 it was assigned to the Ettenheim court and only íts subsequent dissolution did it become part of the district Lahr.

&quot;Kuhbach&quot; was first mentioned in 1035 as &quot;Cuobach&quot;. Initially it belonged to the Geroldsecks. After the family divided into two in 1278 was it made part of Hohengeroldseck (&quot;Vogtei&quot; Seelbach). Ecclesiastically, it was first part of the Burgheim parish and was later assigned to the Lahr parish. After the counterreformation the town became Catholic again and was only made part of Baden in 1819 when it was assigned to the district of Lahr.

&quot;Reichenbach&quot; was first mentioned as &quot;Richenbach&quot; in 1270. The town was divided up between the Houses of Geroldseck and Tiersberg. During the fourteenth century the part owned by the Tiersbergs came after several detours into the possession of Baden and was given to the Röder vassals as a fief. The Hohengeroldseck part eventually became the property of the Counts van der Leyen. Reichenbach was initially Protestant but returned to Catholicism in 1658. The Baden-Röder part was then passed on to the County of Geroldseck in 1806 and with the County came into the possession of Austria in 1815. In 1819 it was returned to Baden and became part of the court of Hohengeroldseck. Only in 1832 was it made part of the Lahr district.

===Religion===

The region around Lahr initially belonged to the Archdiocese of Strasbourg. The city itself was originally attached to the parishes of Dinglingen and Burgheim. Only the Chapel of Our Lady was located in Lahr. In 1259 the Augustinians founded a monastery which was moved to the outskirts of Dinglingen in 1349 and converted into a collegiate monastery in 1482. In 1492 the parish of Burgberg was moved to Lahr and the Chapel of Our Lady became the parish church. After the Reformation was introduced in 1558 until 1567, the monastery was dissolved and Lahr remained exclusively Protestant for the next several centuries. After Lahr came to Baden, the church became seat of a deanery which serves the entire surrounding area. Two other parishes developed from the original one, Christ Church Parish and Peace Parish, but were merged later on to form a combined parish. The combined parish today also includes John&#x27;s Parish in Sulz, the Luther, Paul and Melanchton Parishes in Dinglingen and Lahr-West, and St Peter&#x27;s Parish in Burgheim. Additional Protestant parishes are located in the boroughs of Hugsweier, Kippenheimweiler and Langenwinkel, while Langenwinkel is attached to the parish of Hugsweier and Kippenheimweiler to the parish in neighbouring Kippenheim. Protestants from Kuhbach and Reichenbach belong to the parish of Seelbach and those living in Mietersheim belong to the parish of Lahr. All Protestant parishes belong to the deanery of Lahr within the Evangelical Church in Baden. The Liebenzeller Association is also represented in Lahr.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century Catholics began to return to Lahr and in 1843 the first Catholic parish was founded, its church St. Peter and Paul constructed from 1846. St. Marien became the second Catholic parish in 1960 (its church was built in 1954 through 1956). Additional Catholic parishes exist in Dinglingen (Holy Spirit with church St. Martin in Hugsweier), Kuhbach (Mary Ascension and Chapel of Our Dear Lady), Reichenbach and Sulz (St. Peter and Paul). In Sulz a Simultaneum existed between 1773 and 1959 where Catholics and Protestants used the same church building.

In addition to the two large denominations the following are also represented in Lahr: several independent Protestant churches among them Baptists, Methodists and Pentecostals, and the New Apostolic Church.

===District reform===
In conjunction with several district reforms the following towns were merged with Lahr:

* 1899: Burgheim
* 1933: Dinglingen
* 1972: Hugsweier, Kippenheimweiler, Kuhbach, Langenwinkel, Mietersheim, Reichenbach and Sulz

===Demographics===

Figures reflect city limits at the time and are estimates (until 1870), Census data (¹), or official extensions thereof, counting only primary residences.

¹ Census data

Approximately 9,000 of Lahr&#x27;s citizens are descendants of Germans who settled in Russia, and another 4,000 are descendants of other Soviet nationalities and so every fourth citizen of Lahr currently (as of 2006) lists the former Soviet Union as his or her place of birth.

==Government==
In connection with the district reform in the 1970s, municipal laws of Baden-Württemberg were amended to introduce borough councils for certain boroughs. Residents of such boroughs elect their borough council at each municipal election and the borough council must be consulted on all matters of significance to the respective borough. The Borough President also presides over the Borough Council. In Lahr the boroughs of Hugsweier, Kippenheimweiler, Kughbach, Langenwinkel, Mietersheim, Reichenbach and Sulz have borough councils.

===City council===
The elections in 2014 showed the following results:
* The LEFT: 2 seats
* SPD: 8 seats
* The Greens: 4 seats
* CDU: 8 seats
* FWG: 7 seats
* FDP: 3 seats
*Total: 32 seats
===Mayor===
Initially Lahr was headed up by four members of the council, referred to as &quot;The Four&quot;. From 1377 the council consisted of 12 &quot;Friends of the Council&quot;, of them four were considered mayors. In addition, there was an executor and a regal advocate to facilitate matters between the city and the ruling houses. From the 19th century on, there was only one mayor and a council with 11 members. Currently, the mayor is elected by the city&#x27;s citizens for a term of eight years and he is also the President of the city council. His permanent deputy mayors are the &quot;First councilperson&quot; and &quot;Second councilperson&quot;.

Mayors since 1803
===Coat of arms===
Lahr&#x27;s coat of arms features a split shield. Displayed on the left is a red beam on golden background and on the right a silver wall on blue background. The wall has three merlons, an open gate and a portcullis that is pulled halfway up. The city colors are blue and white. The symbol in the coat of arms was used in official seals since at least 1305. It originates from the coat of arms of the House Geroldseck, founders of the city, and included the then customary symbol for cities, the wall. The wall was replaced with a parapet in the fifteenth century. Between 1898 and 1958 the coat of arms depicted only the parapet with the head of an angel holding the shield. This version was known since the 18th century but the city returned to the original version in 1958.

==People, culture and architecture==

===Buildings===

The &quot;Storchenturm&quot; (crane tower) is the logo of Lahr. The tower is a remnant of the former castle of the Geroldseck and remains together with parts of the old city wall.
Other notables are the City park with museum in the Jamm villa and the foundry in the borough of Reichenbach. The new city hall, which was originally constructed as the home for an entrepreneur, features a facade by Friedrich Weinbrenner.

The main church serving the city is the Lutheran &quot;Stiftskirche&quot;, formerly Church of Our Lady, which is a late-gothic basilica with three naves and a tower that was built in 1874. Much older is the St. Peter&#x27;s church in Burgheim, which is one of the oldest churches on the right side of the Rhine. Between 1877 and 1880 a second Protestant church was built, featuring a dome and built in the style of the Italian Renaissance. The &quot;Friedenskirche&quot; was built in 1956 and the first Catholic church, St. Peter and Paul, was built in 1846 in neo-Roman style and features two towers. The second Catholic church St. Marien was built between 1954 and 1956 and expanded in 1967.

In the boroughs are the Petrus Church in Burgheim (featuring a Roman Choir church with gothic murals), the St Martin&#x27;s Church in Dinglingen (built in 1784), the Melanchton Church in Dinglingen (built 1979), former St. Margarethen Church in Hugsweier (built between 1755 and 1790), St. Martin&#x27;s Church in Hugsweier (built in 1966), Kippenheimweiler Church (built in 1902, Chapel of Our Lady in Kuhbach (built in the 14th and 15th centuries), the church of the Assumption of our Blessed Lady in Kuhbach (built in 1956), the Mietersheim Chapel (built in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Reichenbach Church (built between 1846 and 1848 in neo-Roman style), St. Peter and Paul Church in Sulz (built in 1864 in neo-Roman style) and St. John&#x27;s Church in Sulz (built in 1960).

===Events===
The &quot;Chrysanthema&quot; is a three-week-long floral exhibition that takes place annually in the fall. It is visited by thousands from all over Germany and neighboring countries and features a tremendously decorated &quot;Altstadt&quot; (historic center of town).

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Infrastructure===
 As a former Canadian Forces base (CFB), Lahr owns an airport, the Flughafen Lahr. The runway is 3 km long and 45m wide.

 The city is accessible from the A 5 via the Lahr exit and the B 3, B 36 and B415 all intersect here.

 Lahr (Schwarzw) station is a stop on the Rhine Valley Railway of the Deutsche Bahn but the former main train station in the heart of town and the tracks of the local railway from Seelbach (Schutter) to Kehl have been completely removed.

===Media===
In Lahr, the &quot;Schwarzwälder Bote&quot;, a daily newspaper, publishes a local edition by the name of &quot;Lahrer Zeitung&quot; and the local edition of the &quot;Badische Zeitung&quot; out of Freiburg (formerly &quot;Lahrer Anzeiger&quot;). The &quot;Offenburger Tageblatt&quot; also publishes a daily edition with a very comprehensive local section for Lahr and the surrounding area.

===Public service===
Lahr is home to the IV. Division of the Bereitschaftspolizei and several regional and state courts and of the Departments of Finance and Labor, as well as a notary public maintain branch locations here. Lahr is also the seat of the Deaconies Lahr of both the Archdiocese Freiburg and the Evangelical Church in Baden.

===Education===
There is a private university in Lahr and the hospital is a teaching hospital attached to the University in Freiburg.

The City has three college track high schools (Clara-Schumann-, Max-Planck- and Scheffel-Gymnasium), one non-college track high school (Otto-Hahn-Realschule), one school focusing on special education (&quot;Gutenbergschule&quot;), eight grammar schools (&quot;Eichrodt-Grundschule&quot;, &quot;Geroldseckerschule&quot;, &quot;Johann-Peter-Hebel-Schule&quot;, &quot;Luisenschule&quot;, &quot;Schutterlindenberg-Schule&quot;, &quot;Grundschule Kuhbach&quot;, &quot;Grundschule Langenwinkel&quot;, &quot;Schulhaus Kippenheimweiler&quot; and &quot;Grundschule Mietersheim&quot;), two combined grammar and middle schools (in Reichenbach and in Sulz) and two middle schools (&quot;Friedrich-Hauptschule&quot; und &quot;Theodor-Heuss-Hauptschule&quot; Dinglingen).

In addition, Ortenau (district) operates several vocational schools, a schools for the speech impaired with attached Kindergarten, and a school for the mentally disabled, also with attached Kindergarten.

Additional public schools are the Clara-Schumann-Gymnasium (where students with a degree from non-college track high schools may obtain a degree equivalent to a college-track high school) with room and board, a specialty school for painters, and the nursing school that is attached to the hospital.

Numerous private and specialty training schools complete the picture, among them the &quot;Abendrealschule&quot; and &quot;Abendgymnasium&quot; where students with middle school and non-college track high school diplomas are able to gain college entrance prerequisites on a part-time basis after work.

<doc id="1279290" wikidata="Q222439" url="?curid=1279290" title="Dendromurinae">
<text>Dendromurinae is a subfamily of rodents in the family Nesomyidae and superfamily Muroidea. The dendromurines are currently restricted to Africa, as is the case for all extant members of the family Nesomyidae. The authorship of the subfamily has been attributed to both Alston, 1876, and (incorrectly) to G. M. Allen, 1939.

Two genera, &quot;Dendromus&quot; and &quot;Steatomys&quot;, are relatively common throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa. The remaining genera are relatively rare and have restricted geographic distributions.

The link rat, &quot;Deomys ferugineus&quot;, has been traditionally placed in this subfamily, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that it is more related to the spiny mice, genus &quot;Acomys&quot;. The link rat is now placed in the family Muridae and subfamily Deomyinae. Only two of the currently recognized dendromurine genera, &quot;Dendromus&quot; and &quot;Steatomys&quot;, have been studied in molecular analyses. Considering how distinct these genera are from one another, the placement of all other dendromurine genera should be considered tentative pending closer examination. Another rare genus of &quot;dendromurines&quot;, &quot;Leimacomys&quot;, has recently been placed in a new subfamily (Leimacomyinae) in the family Muridae (Musser and Carleton, 2005).

Fossils attributed to the Dendromurinae are known from Asia as early as 15 million years ago. It has been thought that dendromurines invaded Africa from there and became extinct in Asia due to competition with other muroids. The same may be holding true at present in Africa as the dendromurines have declined there since the invasion of murines and other muroids.

The subfamily Dendromurinae contains 6 genera and 25 species.

<doc id="1279297" wikidata="Q1055260" url="?curid=1279297" title="Lamborghini V10">
<text>The Lamborghini V10 is a ninety degree (90°) V10 petrol engine which was developed for the Lamborghini Gallardo automobile, first sold in 2003.

Developed by Lamborghini, for use in the Gallardo, and the first engine developed for Lamborghini after they were acquired by Audi – part of the Volkswagen Group.

This engine has its origins in two concept cars made by Lamborghini, the 1988 P140 and the 1995 Calà. Both were equipped with engines having a 3.9-litre displacement. In the early 2000s, Lamborghini resumed the project and the engine was redesigned by increasing its displacement.

The crankcase and engine block are built at the Audi Hungaria Zrt. factory in Győr, Hungary, whilst final assembly is carried out at Sant&#x27;Agata Bolognese, Italy. The engine has a 90° V angle and, unusually for a production engine, a dry sump lubrication system is utilised to keep the center of gravity of the engine low.

There was also some speculation that the engine block of the original 5.0-litre Lamborghini V10 was closely based on the Audi 4.2 FSI V8, which Audi produces for its luxury cars. However, this was denied by Audi, in their official documentation for their 5.2 FSI V10 engine, as used in the Audi S6 and Audi S8 – the Lamborghini 5.0 V10 has a cylinder bore spacing of between centres, whereas the Audi 5.2 V10 cylinder bore spacing is , the same as the Audi 4.2 FSI V8. The cylinder heads use the four valves per cylinder layout favoured by the Italian firm, rather than the five valve per cylinder variation formerly favoured by the German members of Volkswagen Group – including Audi and Volkswagen Passenger Cars. It was later confirmed that the new 5.2-litre Lamborghini V10 is mechanically identical to the Audi 5.2 V10 engine, as is evident by Lamborghini&#x27;s usage of Audi&#x27;s Fuel Stratified Injection, and 90 mm cylinder spacing.

Audi
*R8 V10
*S8 D3 
*S6 C6 
*RS 6 C6

(The Lamborghini V10 has also had a placement in the Audi R8, RS6, S8 and S6. The 5.2 V10 used in the S6 and S8 is different in several important aspects, namely a less robust crankshaft with a split pin design, cast aluminum pistons, and a traditional wet-sump oiling system, as well as differences in the valvetrain - all of which, combined, result in the much higher RPM red line and specific power output of the Gallardo and R8)

<text>Belair is a suburb in the south eastern foothills of Adelaide, South Australia at the base of the Mount Lofty Ranges.

==Name==
Before European settlement, the Kaurna people called the area of modern-day Belair &quot;piraldi&quot;. One early European name for the area was Sleep&#x27;s Hill, named after Samuel Sleep, a shepherd who came to South Australia in the 1830s. 
The origin of the modern name &quot;Belair&quot; is uncertain. Gustav Ludewigs, who subdivided the area, may have named the suburb after Bel Air, Martinique, being his wife Maria&#x27;s birthplace. Another theory is that it was named in 1849 after Eugene Bellairs, a Government surveyor who lived in the area.

==History==
The area was used by the Kaurna and Peramangk people for seasonal hunting and gathering. The trees provided gum resin for food and bark for shelter construction, and possums and bandicoots were hunted for food and for their skins to be used in cloaks.

===Government Farm===

The first known European settler in Belair was a squatter named Nicholas Foott. Although he did not own any land, the colonial government allowed him to stay in the area and improve the land until the land was required by the government. Foott built a house on the land some time between 1836 and 1840. In July 1840, Governor George Gawler decided to establish a farm in the area named Government Farm, and Foott was asked to leave. From 1858 to 1860, Old Government House was built on the farm as the summer residence for the Governor of South Australia, which it remained until a new house was built at Marble Hill in 1880.

Two petitions, with 620 signatures between them, were presented to the South Australian Parliament in 1878 calling for a railway line to be constructed into the Adelaide Hills. The first petition desired a railway line so that both the rich and the poor living in the Adelaide Plains would be able to access the hills, viewed as the healthiest part of the Adelaide region. The second petition wanted a railway link to Port Adelaide so that produce could be delivered to markets in the hills at the same price as to markets in North Adelaide, which already had a rail link. After a survey of the Adelaide Hills, the Parliament passed a bill enacting a route from Adelaide to Nairne, which would pass through Belair. Construction work on the line began in 1879 and the section of the line through to Aldgate was opened on 14 March 1883. This included service to the Belair railway station, located in Government Farm.

In 1881, the South Australian government proposed subdividing the land of the farm to meet the increasing demand for land in the Adelaide Hills, but this was met with protests. This led to an Act of Parliament being passed in October 1883 prohibiting the sale of Government Farm without the sanction of Parliament. Further campaigns to protect the land during the 1880s, as well as the greater accessibility to the farm due to the construction of the Adelaide to Nairne Railway line, led to Government Farm being transformed into Belair National Park, proclaimed on 19 December 1891 with the passage of the National Park Act.

===Later development===
Belair was the location of the first facility for the treatment of alcoholism in South Australia, at the Belair Home for Inebriates. The retreat was partially funded by the government and opened in 1877. The building was renamed Hope Lodge in 1893 and operated as a training centre for missionaries until 1907, and is now part of the St. Johns Senior School campus. Belair was also home to multiple sanatoriums for people suffering from tuberculosis. Kalyra Consumptive Home was incorporated in December 1894 by the James Brown Memorial Trust, with its first patients admitted in February or March 1895. Another sanatorium called Nunyara Tuberculosis Sanatorium was opened in 1902 by Dr Arthur Gault, which operated until his death in 1917.

In 1915, quarries were opened at Sleep&#x27;s Hill at the western end of Belair by Burt and Timms, who were contracted to build houses and roads in the nearby suburb of Colonel Light Gardens. Adelaide Quarries Ltd was formed in 1919 to better exploit the quarries, and by the 1950s the total production in the quarries had reached 7 million tonnes. 
In the 1920s, the Belair Progress Association was established to advocate for the development of Belair. They made efforts to stop blasting in nearby quarries and pushed the district council to repair Belair&#x27;s roads. They also lobbied for Windy Point (then called Observation Point) to be set aside as a reserve, which led to the District Council of Mitcham acquiring the land in 1930. At this time, Belair was still a small country town with a population under 200. The population did not begin to grow until the late 1930s, when the population increased from 165 to 398 in three years up to 1940.

==Geography==
Belair is located 10 km south of Adelaide&#x27;s city centre. The suburb includes residential areas, but the majority of suburb&#x27;s area of 14.58 km2 is taken up by Belair National Park, which has an area of 8.35 km2. To the north, the suburb is bounded by the neighbouring suburbs of Lynton and Torrens Park, Randell Park in Mitcham, and the localities of Brown Hill Creek and Crafers West. To the east it is bounded by Sheoak Road and the eastern edge of Belair National Park. To the south it is bounded by Upper Sturt Road. To the west it is bounded by Laffers Road, Gratton Street, Neate Avenue, Gum Grove, Watiparinga Reserve, and the Belair railway line.

===Parks and recreation===
Belair National Park the second-oldest national park in Australia and the oldest in South Australia, established in 1891. After pressure from the Native Fauna and Flora Protection Committee, it was decided in 1923 that all future plantings would consist only of native species of plants. The facilities in the park include walking and mountain biking trails, tennis courts, and ovals with cricket pitches and Australian rules football goalposts. It is also home to Old Government House and State Flora, the oldest plant nursery in South Australia. Other reserves in Belair include Sleeps Hill Reserve, at the former site of the Sleeps Hill quarries and Sleeps Hill railway station, and Windy Point, which has a lookout over the city and coastline.

There are many shared use cycling and walking trails throughout Belair and the surrounding suburbs as part of Mitcham&#x27;s Shared Use Trails network and Belair National Park. This includes the Randell Park Trails, the Lynton Reserve Trails (which goes through Sleeps Hill reserve), and the O&#x27;Deas Reserve, Saddle Hill and Ashby Reserve Trails.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Belair had a population of 4,896, up from 4,411 at the 2016 census and 4,390 at the 2011 census. Only 26 people identified themselves as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, making up just half a percent of the suburb&#x27;s population, well below the national average of 3.2%. Belair is also an older suburb, with a median age of 47 compared with the national median age of 38. 89.6% of people only spoke English at home, and 75.0% reported that they were born in Australia. These were the most commonly nominated ancestries:

* English (47.3%)
* Australian (35.9%)
* Scottish (13.0%)
* Irish (10.7%)
* German (8.5%)

===Religion===
As of 2021, a majority of Belair residents don&#x27;t identify with a religion, with 59.2% of residents falling into the census category of &quot;Secular Beliefs and Other Spiritual Beliefs and No Religious Affiliation&quot;. The most commonly stated religious affiliations in the 2021 census were Anglican (11.1%), Catholic (9.5%), and the Uniting Church (5.9%). Churches in the suburb include Holy Innocents Anglican Church Belair and Belair Uniting Church, both on the same road (Sheoak Road).

==Transport==
The Adelaide-Wolseley railway line runs through Belair, with the Pinera and Belair railway stations being serviced by the Belair railway line, operated by Adelaide Metro.

The suburb is also serviced by regular bus routes, such as the 195, 196 and 197.

==Education==
Belair falls within the catchment area of Belair Jean Bonython Kindergarten, which is in the neighbouring suburb of Glenalta. It is a preschool providing education for children aged 3 to 5.

The suburb includes Belair Primary School, which originally opened in 1957. Belair Schools used to include two separate schools: Belair Primary School and Belair Junior Primary School. The two schools co-located in 1997 and amalgamated into a single school in 2013. Since 2013 the schools have catered to students from Reception to Year 6. The school follows the IB Primary Years Programme, and it is a member of the Eco School Network.

There are no public high schools in Belair. The suburb is part of the catchment area for Blackwood High School in Eden Hills. The suburb does, however, include the private school St John&#x27;s Grammar School, which teaches students from pre-school through to Year 12.

<doc id="1279307" wikidata="Q6942387" url="?curid=1279307" title="Music of the Northern Mariana Islands">
<text>The music of the Northern Mariana Islands is dominated by the folk music of the Chamorros, which remains an important part of the islands&#x27; culture, though elements of music left by American, German, Spanish and Japanese colonizers are also in evidence. There are both Carolinian and Chamorro traditional chant styles. A variant of the Spanish cha-cha-chá is popular, as is a Carolinian &quot;stick dance&quot; which combines improvised percussion and foot stomping. A well-known stick dance group is the Talabwog Men Stick Dancers.

The national anthem of the Northern Mariana Islands is &quot;Gi Talo Gi Halom Tasi&quot; (in Chamorro, &quot;Satil Matawal Pacifico&quot; in Carolinian), which was adopted in October 1996. The song&#x27;s melody comes from a German tune, &quot;Im Schoensten Wiesengrunde&quot;.

Music festivals in the Northern Mariana Islands include the Fiestan Luta, an annual celebration.

<doc id="1279334" wikidata="Q1642488" url="?curid=1279334" title="Chiefdom">
<text>A chiefdom is a political organization of people represented or governed by a chief. Chiefdoms have been discussed, depending on their scope, as a stateless, state analogue or early state system or institution.

Usually a chief&#x27;s position is based on kinship, which is often monopolized by the legitimate senior members of select families or &#x27;houses&#x27;. These elites can form a political-ideological aristocracy relative to the general group.

Chiefdoms and chiefs are sometimes identified as the same as kingdoms and kings, and therefore understood as monarchies, particularly when they are understood as not necessarily states, but having monarchic representation or government.

==Concept==
In anthropological theory, one model of human social development rooted in ideas of cultural evolution describes a chiefdom as a form of social organization more complex than a tribe or a band society, and less complex than a state or a civilization.

Within general theories of cultural evolution, chiefdoms are characterized by permanent and institutionalized forms of political leadership (the chief), centralized decision-making, economic interdependence, and social hierarchy.

Chiefdoms are described as intermediate between tribes and states in the progressive scheme of sociopolitical development formulated by Elman Service: &quot;band - tribe - chiefdom - state&quot;. A chief&#x27;s status is based on kinship, so it is inherited or ascribed, in contrast to the achieved status of Big Man leaders of tribes. Another feature of chiefdoms is therefore pervasive social inequality. They are ranked societies, according to the scheme of progressive sociopolitical development formulated by Morton Fried: &quot;egalitarian - ranked - stratified - state&quot;.

The most succinct definition of a chiefdom in anthropology is by Robert L. Carneiro: &quot;An autonomous political unit comprising a number of villages or communities under the permanent control of a paramount chief&quot; (Carneiro 1981: 45).

=== Chiefdoms in archaeological theory ===
In archaeological theory, Service&#x27;s definition of chiefdoms as “redistribution societies with a permanent central agency of coordination” (Service 1962: 134) has been most influential. Many archaeologists, however, dispute Service&#x27;s reliance upon redistribution as central to chiefdom societies, and point to differences in the basis of finance (staple finance v. wealth finance). Service argued that chief rose to assume a managerial status to redistribute agricultural surplus to ecologically specialized communities within this territory (staple finance). Yet in re-studying the Hawaiian chiefdoms used as his case study, Timothy Earle observed that communities were rather self-sufficient. What the chief redistributed was not staple goods, but prestige goods to his followers that helped him to maintain his authority (wealth finance).

Some scholars contest the utility of the chiefdom model for archaeological inquiry. The most forceful critique comes from Timothy Pauketat, whose &quot;Chiefdom and Other Archaeological Delusions&quot; outlines how chiefdoms fail to account for the high variability of the archaeological evidence for middle-range societies. Pauketat argues that the evolutionary underpinnings of the chiefdom model are weighed down by racist and outdated theoretical baggage that can be traced back to Lewis Morgan&#x27;s 19th-century cultural evolution. From this perspective, pre-state societies are treated as underdeveloped, the savage and barbaric phases that preceded civilization. Pauketat argues that the chiefdom type is a limiting category that should be abandoned, and takes as his main case study Cahokia, a central place for the Mississippian culture of North America.

Pauketat&#x27;s provocation, however, has been accused of not offering a sound alternative to the chiefdom type. For while he claims that chiefdoms are a delusion, he describes Cahokia as a civilization. This has been debated to uphold rather than challenge the evolutionary scheme he contests.

===Simple category===
Chiefdoms are characterized by the centralization of authority and pervasive inequality. At least two inherited social classes (elite and commoner) are present. (The ancient Hawaiian chiefdoms had as many as four social classes.) An individual might change social class during a lifetime by extraordinary behavior. A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom, with the greatest influence, power, and prestige. Kinship is typically an organizing principle, while marriage, age, and sex can affect one&#x27;s social status and role.

A single simple chiefdom is generally composed of a central community surrounded by or near a number of smaller subsidiary communities. All of the communities recognize the authority of a single kin group or individual with hereditary centralized power, dwelling in the primary community. Each community will have its own leaders, which are usually in a tributary and/or subservient relationship to the ruling elite of the primary community.

===Complex category===
A complex chiefdom is a group of simple chiefdoms controlled by a single paramount center and ruled by a paramount chief. Complex chiefdoms have two or even three tiers of political hierarchy. Nobles are clearly distinct from commoners and do not usually engage in any form of agricultural production. The higher members of society consume most of the goods that are passed up the hierarchy as a tribute.

Reciprocal obligations are fulfilled by the nobles carrying out rituals that only they can perform. They may also make token, symbolic redistributions of food and other goods. In two- or three-tiered chiefdoms, higher-ranking chiefs have control over a number of lesser ranking individuals, each of whom controls specific territory or social units. Political control rests on the chief&#x27;s ability to maintain access to a sufficiently large body of tribute, passed up the line by lesser chiefs. These lesser chiefs in turn collect from those below them, from communities close to their own center. At the apex of the status hierarchy sits the paramount.

Anthropologists and archaeologists have demonstrated through research that chiefdoms are a relatively unstable form of social organization. They are prone to cycles of collapse and renewal, in which tribal units band together, expand in power, fragment through some form of social stress, and band together again. An example of this kind of social organization were the Germanic Peoples who conquered the western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE. Although commonly referred to as tribes, anthropologists classified their society as chiefdoms. They had a complex social hierarchy consisting of kings, a warrior aristocracy, common freemen, serfs, and slaves.

The Native American tribes sometimes had ruling kings or satraps (governors) in some areas and regions. The Cherokee, for example, had an imperial-family ruling system over a long period of history. The early Spanish explorers in the Americas reported on the Indian kings and kept extensive notes during what is now called the conquest. Some of the native tribes in the Americas had princes, nobles, and various classes and castes. The &quot;Great Sun&quot; was somewhat like the Great Khans of Asia and eastern Europe. Much like an emperor, the Great Sun of North America is the best example of chiefdoms and imperial kings in North American Indian history. The Aztecs of Mexico had a similar culture.

==Chiefdoms on the Indian subcontinent==

The Indus Valley Civilisation (3300 BCE - 1700 BCE) was a hegemony of chiefdoms with supreme chiefs in each and a system of subsidiary chiefs. The ranks of the chiefs included ordinary chiefs, elders, priests or cattle-owners and head chiefs.

The &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, a work on politics written some time between the 4th century BC and 2nd century AD by Indian author Chanakya, similarly describes the Rajamandala (or &quot;Raja-mandala,&quot;) as circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the state of a king (&quot;raja&quot;). Also see Suhas Chatterjee, &quot;Mizo Chiefs and the Chiefdom&quot; (1995).

== African chiefdoms ==
Most African traditional societies involved chiefdoms in their political and social structure before European colonisation. For an example see the political organisation of the Mandinka people in West Africa. Each clan, tribe, kingdom, and empire had its traditional leader, king, or queen. Ewe people call the king or chief &quot;Togbui Ga&quot;, the Fon people &quot;Dah&quot;, the Kotafon people &quot;Ga&quot;, and Ashanti people &quot;Asantehene&quot;. Traditional authority is a distinguishing feature in the landscape of contemporary Africa. It remains important in organising the life of people at the local level despite modern state structures.

==Chiefdoms in Hispaniola==
==Native chieftain system in China==
&quot;Tusi&quot; (), also known as Headmen or Chieftains, were tribal leaders recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era Chinese governments, principally in Yunnan. The arrangement is generally known as the Native Chieftain System ().

== Alternatives to chiefdoms ==

In prehistoric South-West Asia, alternatives to chiefdoms were the non-hierarchical systems of complex acephalous communities, with a pronounced autonomy of single-family households. These communities have been analyzed recently by Berezkin, who suggests the &quot;Apa Tanis&quot; as their ethnographic parallel (Berezkin 1995). Frantsouzoff (2000) finds a more developed example of such type of polities in ancient South Arabia in the Wadi Hadhramawt of the 1st millennium BCE.

In Southeast Asian history up to the early 19th century, the metaphysical view of the cosmos called the mandala (i.e., circle) is used to describe a Southeast Asian political model, which in turn describes the diffuse patterns of political power distributed among Mueang (principalities) where circles of influence were more important than central power. The concept counteracts modern tendencies to look for unified political power like that of the large European kingdoms and nation states, which one scholar posited were an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies.

Nikolay Kradin has demonstrated that an alternative to the state seems to be represented by the supercomplex chiefdoms created by some nomads of Eurasia. The number of structural levels within such chiefdoms appears to be equal, or even to exceed those within the average state, but they have a different type of political organization and political leadership. Such types of political entities do not appear to have been created by the agriculturists (e.g., Kradin 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004).

<text>Mimico Creek is a stream that flows through Brampton, Mississauga and Toronto in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada. It is long, is in the Great Lakes Basin, and is a tributary of Lake Ontario.

The creek&#x27;s name is derived from the community of Mimico, which is from the Ojibwe word &quot;omiimiikaa&quot; meaning &quot;abundant with wild pigeons&quot; (c.f. 19th century Mississaugas &quot;omiimii&quot;, &quot;pigeon&quot;). Previous names included River Mimicoke and Mimicoke Creek.

==Course==
The watershed of lies between the Humber River to the east and Etobicoke Creek to the west.

The creek begins in Brampton, and flows through the community of Malton (now part of Mississauga);
it continues southeast, past Toronto Pearson International Airport; and through a shallow valley surrounded by the urban neighbourhoods of Islington and Mimico. The creek is often encased in a concrete spillway to contain the fast flowing water that occurs during rainstorms. Mimico Creek crosses Bloor Street near the Islington Subway Station, and empties into Lake Ontario about west of the mouth of the Humber River.

Originally the creek had dozens of small tributary streams, the largest of which was Bonar Creek, that joined Mimico Creek near its mouth. Most of the tributaries were less than one kilometre long.

==Recreation==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Humber Bay Park was constructed at the mouth of Mimico Creek. The park consists of two headlands, built using landfill from local construction projects that flank the mouth. As a result, Mimico Creek is sometimes mistaken for the Humber River.

==Mimico Creek Bridge==
In 1994 Mimico Creek Bridge opened to allow pedestrians to access both east and west sections of the park. It is designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.

<text>Kirkfield Park is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1979, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1981. The riding is located in the westernmost tip of the City of Winnipeg. It contains the neighbourhoods of Glendale, Westwood, Kirkfield Park, Woodhaven, Birchwood, Booth, Silver Heights and part of Assiniboia Downs

Kirkfield Park is bordered to the east by St. James, to the south and west by Charleswood, and to the north by Assiniboia. The St Charles and Glendale Country Clubs are in this riding, as are the Chapel Lawn Memorial Gardens and Assumption Cemetery.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,236. In 1999, the average family income was $63,038, and the unemployment rate was 5.80%. Almost 13% of the riding&#x27;s population are immigrants, including 6% German and 5% Ukrainian. Over twenty per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are over 65 years of age.

The service sector accounts for 15% of Kirkfield Park&#x27;s industry, followed by 13% in retail trade.

Since its creation in 1981, the seat has been nearly continuously held by the Progressive Conservatives. Previously it was won by the New Democratic Party only twice, in 2007 and 2011, until 2023 when the NDP&#x27;s Logan Oxenham picked the seat up a third time after having originally been defeated in the previous year&#x27;s by-election.

<text>Mark John Geragos (born October 5, 1957) is an American criminal defense lawyer and the managing partner of Geragos &amp; Geragos, in Los Angeles.

==Early life and education==
Geragos was born in Los Angeles, California, where he attended Flintridge Preparatory School in La Cañada, graduating with honors. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Haverford College, in 1979, double-majoring in anthropology and sociology, then his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Loyola Law School at the Loyola Marymount University in 1982. He was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1983.

An Armenian-American, Geragos maintains a close relationship with the Armenian community. He has earned praise from the Armenian National Committee of America, and serves on the Advisory Committee of Birthright Armenia, as the chairman of Armenian Bone Marrow Donor Registry, and also is involved with the Armenian religious community. He has been a member of the Armenia Fund International Board of Trustees since 2006.

==Career==
Geragos is the managing partner for the law firm of Geragos &amp; Geragos, where he oversees criminal defense and civil litigation. He was one of the lead lawyers in two groundbreaking federal class action lawsuits against New York Life Insurance and AXA, for insurance policies issued in the early 20th century during the time of the Armenian genocide of more than 1.5 million Armenians. The two cases settled for over $37.5 million, in 2004 and 2005.

In December 2022, Geragos partnered with law colleague and MeidasTouch co-founder Ben Meiselas to form Engine Vision Media and acquire &quot;Los Angeles&quot; magazine from Hour Media.

===Office===
The firm&#x27;s office is located on Figueroa Street in Downtown Los Angeles in a former Los Angeles Fire Department fire station, Engine Company No. 28, alongside Kabateck LLP. The 1912 building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Los Angeles and is jointly owned by Geragos and his investment partner, attorney Brian S. Kabateck, since 2007, among other joint acquisitions; the partners have litigated together and also, in recent years, against one another over their mutual investments.

==Notable clients==
Geragos first garnered national attention after representing convicted Whitewater figure Susan McDougal, the former business partner of former President Bill Clinton. Geragos requested a presidential pardon for McDougal on January 20, 2001, though the decision was entirely up to former President Clinton, pursuant to Article II of the United States&#x27; Constitution. Geragos also represented McDougal in a 12-count embezzlement trial in Los Angeles in which the jury returned a not-guilty verdict.

He has since represented many notable clients, including Gary Condit; suspended NASCAR driver Jeremy Mayfield; Scott Peterson; Scott Barney; Roger Clinton Jr.; Lee Tamahori; Kesha, briefly, in her lawsuit against Dr. Luke, until May 2016; and Clare Bronfman. Other notable clients include:

* Winona Ryder – In December 2002, Geragos defended Academy Award-nominated actress Winona Ryder on charges of stealing more than $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills, California, store in 2001. With the help from Geragos, she was sentenced only to three years&#x27; probation and ordered to undergo psychological and drug counseling.
* Michael Jackson – In the early stages of the Michael Jackson molestation case, Geragos simultaneously handled this case and the Scott Peterson case, two of the best-known U.S. trials at that time. Geragos&#x27;s &quot;crushingly busy calendar&quot; in the courtroom earned him a rebuke by a judge in an embezzlement case Geragos was also representing. On April 26, 2004, Jackson removed Geragos as his attorney, replacing him with Thomas Mesereau. In a public statement provided by his spokesperson, Raymone Bain, Jackson said, &quot;It is imperative that I have the full attention of those who are representing me. My life is at stake...&quot; suggesting that Geragos may not have had enough time to handle his case because of his workload. Geragos later said that he was dismayed to see Jackson climb atop an SUV to the cheers of his fans after leaving the Santa Barbara County, California, courthouse in January 2004, when he was first arraigned on the initial complaint. Geragos&#x27;s co-counsel, Benjamin Brafman, also expressed disapproval of Jackson&#x27;s actions. &quot;Although [in January] the lawyers explained the behavior as &#x27;Michael being Michael&#x27;,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;they are said to have privately expressed consternation at the display of frivolity in the face of serious charges.&quot;
* Roger Clinton Jr. – Geragos won dismissal of all alcohol-related charges against former President Clinton&#x27;s brother.
* Carradine family – He assisted the family of actor David Carradine in the aftermath of his accidental death. Geragos had previously represented a class of plaintiffs that had included actor Keith Carradine, his spouse, actress , attorney Stephen Kolodny, and designer Donna Dubrow in a class-action lawsuit related to private investigator Anthony Pellicano&#x27;s illegal wiretapping conspiracy and subsequent conviction.
* Greg Anderson – In 2006, Geragos represented Anderson, who was most notably the personal trainer of Barry Bonds. On July 5, 2006, Anderson was found in contempt of court by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who jailed Anderson for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating perjury accusations against Bonds. Geragos announced that he would file an appeal based on his assertion that the subpoena to testify violated Anderson&#x27;s July 2005 plea bargain agreement in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative case. Anderson was to be held until he agreed to testify or until the grand jury&#x27;s term expired. Geragos insisted that his client would not testify. The grand jury expired on July 20, 2006, and Anderson was released from prison two weeks later. On August 28, 2006, Anderson was again found in contempt of court for refusing to testify before a newly convened grand jury and sentenced to prison. Anderson was freed on October 5, 2006, after an order from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the trial judge had committed legal errors. Anderson was later sent back to jail on November 16, 2006.
* Cameron Brown – Geragos was the attorney for Brown, who was charged with murdering his four-year-old daughter by throwing her off a Rancho Palos Verdes cliff. The twelve-week trial ended in August 2006 without a verdict. The jury deliberated for over nine days but was hopelessly deadlocked and a mistrial was declared by Torrance Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold. With the Brown family&#x27;s funds depleted, Geragos ended his representation. Subsequently, Judge Arnold appointed Geragos associate Pat Harris, with whom he had tried the case, to represent Brown in a second trial that also ended in a hung jury. A third trial saw him convicted. After the second trial resulted in a hung jury, the Geragos &amp; Geragos firm turned the case over to attorney Herbert M. Barish.
* Victor Willis – In September 2006, Geragos represented the Village People front man on charges of drug and weapons possession. Facing jail time, Geragos successfully negotiated a sentence of three years probation and treatment for drug addiction at the Betty Ford Clinic.
* Amphit Dhaliwal and Kulbir Dhaliwal – In December 2007, the two survivors of the tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo, hired Geragos to represent them against potential criminal charges, and also with the anticipation of filing a lawsuit against the zoo. Despite pressure from city officials, the local police inspector made it clear that there were no grounds for filing criminal charges against the Dhaliwal brothers related to the tiger attack. Geragos filed a federal suit against the Zoo and the City of San Francisco for violation of the Dhaliwal brothers&#x27; civil rights, including the Dhaliwals&#x27; being subject to search and seizure without probable cause, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Geragos settled the civil suit in the early phase of the court process for $900,000.
* Kazuyoshi Miura – In 2008, Geragos joined the defense of Japanese businessman Miura, who committed suicide before his trial.
* Chris Brown – Geragos represented Brown, who pleaded guilty to the assault of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. On February 8, 2009, Geragos brought Chris Brown to surrender to the LAPD. Later, Brown was arrested, and his court date was set to be on March 5, 2009. Geragos and Brown attended the court date, but did not plea and asked for arraignment until the next court date, April 6, 2009. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault and was sentenced to 5 years&#x27; probation and 6 months&#x27; community service. However, Brown’s inability to adhere to the rules of his probation ultimately led to his dismissal from rehab and the singer was thrown in jail from March 2014 to June of that year. Under counsel from Geragos, Brown was once again released under probation. Early in 2015, Brown&#x27;s probation was revoked after he was present in two nightclubs where shootings took place. His probation officer had a problem with the singer traveling to San Jose, to perform at the nightclub where an incident occurred leaving five people shot and injured. Brown was aware his probation could end with the hearing, and before entering the courthouse, he tweeted: &quot;Hopefully this is my last day in court … Pray for me.&quot; However, at Brown’s scheduled March 20 court date, with the help of Geragos, Brown’s probation officer reversed course, saying in a positive review that Brown had completed his community service sentence. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin concurred, ruling the singer would no longer be under the watchful eye of the judicial system. Geragos said this of his client, “He is in a spot right now and a place right now that I couldn’t be prouder of him,” adding that the end of Brown’s probation is “a monumental feat for him.”
* Colin Kaepernick – Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first filed a grievance against the NFL in October 2017, claiming that the NFL tried to keep him from playing after he chose to kneel during the national anthem. The quarterback opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March of the same year and was not picked up later in free agency. Kaepernick began kneeling during the 2016 season to protest racial inequality and police brutality. Safety Eric Reid and several other NFL players eventually joined him. Reid, a former teammate of Kaepernick&#x27;s, was also a member of the grievance Kaepernick filed. After several months of ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL, both Kaepernick and Reid withdrew their collusion cases against the National Football League. On February 15, both Geragos and co-counsel Ben Meiselas released a joint statement with the NFL, declaring the resolution of the matter was subject to a confidentiality agreement.
* Jussie Smollett – Geragos represented Smollett in the 2019 alleged false police report. On March 12, 2019, it was reported that Chicago prosecutors had dropped all 16 criminal charges against Empire star Jussie Smollett as part of a deferred prosecution agreement against him. As part of the conditions of the deal, Smollett did 16 hours of community service and forfeited his $10,000 bond to the city. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he wanted Jussie Smollett to cover the cost of the Chicago police department’s investigation, which amounted to $130,000. Smollett’s attorneys responded in a statement via NBC News that &quot;Jussie has paid enough&quot;. Geragos and his firm also filed a motion to seal the case, which was granted by a judge. On April 23, 2019, Geragos was sued, along with Tina Glandian (another member of Smollett&#x27;s legal team), under claims of defamation and false light by the Osundairo brothers (originally arrested in connection with an alleged attack on the actor). However, a defamatory quote the Osundairos attributed to Glandian and Geragos in their lawsuit was in fact, said by their own attorney, Gloria Schmidt. The Osundairo brothers also paraphrased statements they claimed Geragos said on the &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; podcast (which Geragos co-hosts with comic Adam Carolla), alleging Geragos dragged their reps through the mud by indicating the brothers had attacked Smollett, committed perjury and conspired to make false statements to clear their names. Geragos submitted transcripts of his podcast during the time of the criminal legal proceedings, noting he never said the brothers&#x27; names, nor did he say or indicate what they attributed to him. The case was dismissed by the judge.
* &quot;Piper Partridge, et al v. City of Benton, Arkansas, et al&quot; – In March 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city of Benton, Arkansas a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle&#x27;s parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city’s officer, Kyle Ellison, and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. However, on July 3, 2019, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed in 2017 against Benton police by the parents of the suicidal 17-year-old boy (Keagan) who was shot and killed while complying with an officer&#x27;s order (Kyle Ellison) to move a gun away from his head. Filed by Geragos and Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman, the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. Miller said that after Ellison ordered Schweikle to drop the gun and the boy moved it away from his head, the intention behind his actions was ambiguous, leaving the officer little choice but to shoot. Miller noted, &quot;Keagan could have quickly pointed the gun at Ellison and opened fire almost instantaneously ... Ellison had a right to protect himself&quot;. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said Miller ruled on the matter too early in the process. In 2019, an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court finding that a Benton police officer Kyle Ellison had acted reasonably when he fatally shot a suicidal teen, Keagan Schweikle, in October 2016. In March 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city&#x27;s motion to dismiss the lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle&#x27;s parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city, officer Kyle Ellison and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. Filed by Geragos and Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman, the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. A panel of federal judges restored the lawsuit over the officer-involved shooting death of 17-year-old Keagan Schweikle of Benton.
* Scottie Pippen – In February 2014, Scottie Pippen hired Geragos to file a countersuit against a Malibu man who alleged the former NBA All-Star assaulted him at a restaurant last year. Camran Shafighi filed a $4 million lawsuit against Pippen, accusing him of a “brutal and unjustified physical attack&quot; that allegedly occurred outside upscale Nobu restaurant after Shafighi had sought a picture with the former Chicago Bull. In the cross-complaint filed by Geragos earlier in February, alleged Shafighi cursed at Pippen using racial slurs, spat on him and his children and said, &quot;I’m going to kill you&quot;. The cross-complaint also alleged that Shafighi was “extremely aggressive and noticeably intoxicated” and calls for unspecified damages &quot;according to proof&quot;. 
* Travelers Insurance – Mark Geragos and his law firm—along with multiple clients—are suing Travelers Insurance for initially denying coverage of their pandemic-related claims. The firm says that while it&#x27;s technically an essential business and not subject to a mandated shutdown, access to its downtown L.A. office has been &quot;greatly limited&quot; and the company has &quot;been forced to deal with a substantial loss in business traffic and client/law-related business activities&quot;.
* Cain Velasquez - Geragos began representing former UFC Heavyweight Champion Cain Velasquez, in defense against criminal charges in Santa Clara County, California, in March 2022.

== Alleged involvement in Nike extortion case ==
Geragos was alleged to have participated in a scheme with attorney Michael Avenatti to extort Nike, but was not charged. At the sentencing hearing, lawyers for Avenatti questioned why Geragos had not been charged. The judge&#x27;s rationale for reducing Avenatti&#x27;s sentence was that Geragos was “a central figure in the criminal conduct,” but &quot;suffered no consequences as a result&quot;, and &quot;was not even charged.” In November 2019, according to a new indictment filed in Manhattan federal court, conspiracy charges against Michael Avenatti were dropped. The new indictment filed also appears to clear Mark Geragos.

== Media ==
Geragos occasionally appears as both guest and legal commentator on TV. He has appeared on the &quot;Today&quot; show, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;, &quot;On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren&quot;, &quot;How It Really Happened&quot; and has appeared a number of times on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, including its 20th-anniversary show. Geragos was employed by CNN in a contributor role until March 25, 2019, when he was reportedly implicated in an alleged scheme with attorney Michael Avenatti to extort more than $20 million from Nike, Inc.

In addition to his former role as contributor on CNN, Mark Geragos and Sunny Hostin hosted a 2014 legal program entitled &quot;Making the Case&quot;.

Geragos has made multiple appearances on the &quot;Adam Carolla Show&quot; since 2013, usually giving commentary on whatever is the top legal issue in pop culture. He guest-hosted for Carolla in April 2014 while Carolla was shooting his independent feature film &quot;Road Hard&quot;. Geragos filled in for Dr. Drew Pinsky and co-hosted with Carolla in March 2015 on &quot;The Adam and Dr. Drew Show&quot;, another podcast that airs on Carolla&#x27;s Carolla Digital Network.

In June 2015, it was announced that Geragos would co-host a podcast with Carolla that would be a part of Carolla Digital. The show is called &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; and features Carolla and Geragos discussing issues in society including the law, from Geragos&#x27;s viewpoint as a civil and criminal defense attorney. The show debuted on July 25, 2015, and new episodes debut every Saturday.

Geragos was an executive producer for the 2016 ABC network television series &quot;Notorious&quot;, which was inspired by the working relationship between Geragos and &quot;Larry King Live&quot; producer Wendy Walker. The show was cancelled after one season.

&quot;Mistrial: An Inside Look at How the Criminal Justice System Works&quot;, co-authored by Geragos and Pat Harris, was published by Penguin in 2013.

<text>The Lamborghini V8 is a ninety degree (90°) V8 petrol engine designed by Lamborghini in the 1970s for their less-expensive vehicles. It was only the second internal combustion engine ever developed by the company, and first saw production for the 1971 Lamborghini Urraco. It was designed by Giampaolo Dallara. The all-aluminium alloy engine was introduced as a 2.5-litre variant, displacing , but was expanded, by increasing the piston stroke to a 3.0-litre variant for 1975 - now displacing .

A 2.0-litre reduced-stroke version was also introduced in 1975 for sale in Italy, displacing , because of Italian legislation which imposed punitive taxes on cars whose engines displaced more than 2.0 litres.

This V8 engine was also used in two other models, the Lamborghini Silhouette in 1976–1977 in which it kept the 3.0-litre displacement, and the slightly updated replacement in 1982, the Lamborghini Jalpa, which saw the engine increased in size to 3.5 litres, displacing , for ease in meeting ever-tighter emissions requirements.

<text>Charleswood was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1968, and formally existed from the provincial election of 1969 until that of 2019. The riding was in the westernmost tip of Manitoba&#x27;s capital and largest city, Winnipeg.

Charleswood was bordered to the east by Tuxedo and Fort Whyte, to the north by Kirkfield Park, and to the south and west by the rural riding of Morris.

Charleswood&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,262. The riding&#x27;s character is middle- and upper-middle class: in 1999, the average family income was $70,417, and the unemployment rate was 5.20%. Eleven per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are immigrants, with over half being of German origin.

The service sector accounts for 15% of Charleswood&#x27;s industry, with a further 12% in the retail trade and 11% in health and social sciences.

Members of the Progressive Conservative Party represented Charleswood throughout its existence. During his term as Premier of Manitoba, from 1977 to 1981, Sterling Lyon represented Charleswood.

<doc id="1279412" wikidata="Q310961" url="?curid=1279412" title="Caulerpa taxifolia">
<text>Caulerpa taxifolia is a species of green seaweed, an alga of the genus &quot;Caulerpa&quot;, native to tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Caribbean Sea. The species name &quot;taxifolia&quot; arises from the resemblance of its leaf-like fronds to those of the yew (&quot;Taxus&quot;). 

A strain of the species bred for use in aquariums has established non-native populations in waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the United States, and Australia. It is one of two species of algae listed in 100 of the World&#x27;s Worst Invasive Alien Species compiled by the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group.

==Description==

&quot;C. taxifolia&quot; is light green with stolons (stems) on the sea floor, from which sparsely-branched upright fronds of approximately 20–60 cm (8–24 in) in height arise. Algae in the genus &quot;Caulerpa&quot; synthesize a mixture of toxins termed caulerpicin, believed to impart a peppery taste to the plants. The effects of the specific toxin synthesized by &quot;C. taxifolia&quot;, caulerpenyne, have been studied, with extracts from &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; being found to negatively affect P-glycoprotein-ATPase in the sea sponge &quot;G. cydonium&quot;.

Like all members of the genus &quot;Caulerpa,&quot; &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; consists of a single cell with many nuclei. The algae has been identified as the largest known single-celled organism. Wild-type &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; is monoecious.

==Use in aquaria==
&quot;Caulerpa&quot; species are commonly used in aquaria for their aesthetic qualities and ability to control the growth of undesired species. &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; has been cultivated for use in aquaria in western Europe since the early 1970s. A clone of the alga that was resistant to cold was observed in the tropical aquarium at the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart and further bred by exposure to chemicals and ultraviolet light. The zoo distributed the strain to other aquaria, including the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco.

The aquarium strain is morphologically identical to native populations of the species. However, a 2008 study found that a population of the aquarium strain near Caloundra, Australia exhibited markedly reduced sexual reproduction, with only male plants present during some reproductive episodes. The aquarium strain can survive out of water for up to 10 days in moist conditions, with 1 cm fragments capable of producing viable plants.

==Status as invasive species==

Outside its native range, &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; is listed as an invasive species. It is one of two algae on the list of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species compiled by the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group (alongside Wakame). The species is able to thrive in heavily polluted waters, possibly contributing to its spread in the Mediterranean.

===Presence in the Mediterranean Sea===

The presence of &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; in the Mediterranean was first reported in 1984 in an area adjacent to the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. Alexandre Meinesz, a marine biologist, attempted to alert Moroccan and French authorities to the spread of the strain in 1989, but the governments failed to respond to his concerns. The occurrence of the strain is generally believed to be due to an accidental release by the museum, but Monaco rejected the attribution and instead claimed that the observed algae was a mutant strain of &quot;C. mexicana&quot;. By 1999, scientists agreed that it was no longer possible to eliminate the presence of &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; in the Mediterranean.

A study published in 2002 found that beds of &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot; in the Bay of Menton were not negatively affected eight years after colonization by &quot;C. taxifolia&quot;. Other published studies have shown that fish diversity and biomass are equal or greater in Caulerpa meadows than in seagrass beds and that Caulerpa had no effect on composition or richness of fish species.

Studies in 1998 and 2001 found that the strain observed in the Mediterranean was genetically identical to aquarium strains, with similarities to an additional population in Australia.

===Presence in Australia===

A 2007 study found that a native bivalve mollusc species was negatively affected by the presence of &quot;C. taxifolia&quot;, but that the effect was not necessarily different from that of native seagrass species. A 2010 study indicated that the effect of detritus from &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; negatively impacted abundance and species richness.

===Presence in California===

&quot;C. taxifolia&quot; was found in waters near San Diego, California, in 2000, where chlorine bleach was used in efforts to eradicate the strain. The strain was declared eradicated from Agua Hedionda Lagoon in 2006. California passed a law in 2001 forbidding the possession, sale, transport, or release of &quot;Caulerpa taxifolia&quot; within the state. 
The Mediterranean clone of &quot;C. taxifolia&quot; was listed as a noxious weed in 1999 by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, prohibiting interstate sale and transport of the strain without a permit under the Noxious Weed Act and Plant Protection Act.

===Other negative effects===

&quot;C. taxifolia&quot; may become entangled in fishing gear and boat propellers.

===Control methods===

&quot;C. taxifolia&quot; may be controlled via mechanical removal, poisoning with chlorine, or application of salt. Researchers at the University of Nice investigated possible use of a species of sea slug, &quot;Elysia subornata&quot;, as a possible natural control method, but found that it was not suitable for use in the Mediterranean due to cold winter water temperatures and insufficient population density.

<doc id="1279477" wikidata="Q677705" url="?curid=1279477" title="Hohner">
<text>Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH &amp; Co. KG is a German manufacturer of musical instruments, founded in 1857 by Matthias Hohner (1833–1902). It is a subsidiary of Matth. Hohner AG. The roots of the Hohner firm are in Trossingen, Baden-Württemberg. Hohner has manufactured a wide range of instruments, such as  harmonicas, kazoos, accordions, recorder flutes, melodicas, banjos, electric, acoustic, resonator and classical guitars, basses, mandolins and ukuleles (under the brand name &quot;Lanikai&quot;). Hohner is known mostly for its harmonicas.

From the 1940s through 1990s, the company also manufactured various electric/electronic keyboards. Especially in the 1960s and 1990s, they manufactured a range of innovative and popular electromechanical keyboard instruments; the cembalet, pianet, basset, guitaret, and clavinet. In the 1980s, several Casio synthesizers (such as the Casio HT-3000/Hohner KS61midi and the VZ-1/HS-2) were sold under the Hohner brand.

Nowadays, Hohner produces harmonicas, melodicas, accordions and recorder flutes.

==History==

Clock maker Matthias Hohner began crafting diatonic harmonicas in 1857, assisted by his wife and a single employee. 650 were made in the first year.
Hohner harmonicas quickly became popular, and in his lifetime Matthias built the largest harmonica factory in the world.
During the American Civil War, Matthias Hohner distributed harmonicas to family members in the United States who in turn gave them to the soldiers.

In the 1920s, Hohner began manufacturing chromatic harmonicas, which unlike the &quot;standard&quot; diatonic form can be played in any key. Famous harmonicist Borrah Minevitch claimed he sold his design for the chromatic harmonica to Hohner.
In 1964 Hohner released &quot;The Beatles Harmonica Kit&quot; which was sold in a blister package, much like most Hohner harmonicas nowadays, retailed for $2.95, and help what Hohner calls &quot;bring about a new popularity upsurge of the Hohner harmonica on both sides of the Atlantic.&quot;.

Matthias Karl Hohner, son of and a direct descendant in fourth generation and name bearer of the founder , was one of the last members of the Hohner dynasty involved in managing the family business, he worked since 1924 at the company and in 1965 he became the president till 1971 when he died. His son Matthias Francisco Hohner belonged to the first generation of direct descendants who did not enter into the family business. Many direct descendants of the founder are still active as members of the &quot;Deutsches Harmonika Museum&quot; and the &quot;Hohner&#x27;sche Familienverein&quot;.

In 1989, a controlling interest in Hohner was acquired by Kunz-Holding GmbH &amp; Co., a German wood products manufacturer. Kunz obtained 67 percent of the public firm, with the Hohner family retaining an 8 percent stake.

In 1997, the Taiwanese company KHS Musical Instruments bought a majority holding in Hohner from Kunz via the Tortola based HS Investments Group. The company returned to profitability in 2001, after more than 20 years of losses. By 2012, HS Investments Group held a 75% stake in Hohner.

==Diatonic harmonicas==
===Marine Band===

&quot;The Marine Band&quot; is the base model of the line. Technically named the Marine Band 1896/20 for the year it was introduced and the twenty reeds it possesses, it has been the basis of a number of Hohner&#x27;s harmonicas over the years. It also has some tuning variations like the 1896N (natural minor key) and the 1896H (harmonic minor key).

The Marine Band has been Hohner&#x27;s most popular model of harmonica for generations. Made in Germany on a wood comb, most blues and rock artists play a Marine Band. Several noted users are Bob Dylan, Brian Jones, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Little Walter and Neil Young. There are various subdivisions of the Marine Band.

The Special 20 (#560) was introduced in the mid-1970s. It has the same reeds as a Marine Band, but it has a plastic comb instead of a wooden comb, and rounded edges. It was the first Hohner harmonica to have a plastic comb, which not only made the instrument more airtight, but also eliminated the swelling wood combs go through as they moisten from use. Made in Germany, this model quickly became the preferred choice of many rock and blues players. Now, most harmonicas being manufactured from all companies are based upon the Special 20. Its most noted user is John Popper, who appears on the blister. Like the 1896, the Special 20 also has tuning variations available, like the #560C in country styled tuning, and the #560N in natural minor.

The Marine Band Deluxe has all the features of the original Marine Band with tighter construction and a new cover design which creates a greater volume.

The Marine Band Crossover also features the same reeds, but is made on a bamboo comb that is water repellent.

The Marine Band Thunderbird is a model of low and super-low pitched 10-hole diatonic harmonica that was introduced in 2011. It possesses a bamboo comb like the Crossover, and a conical shaped lower cover plate. Designed by noted harmonica player and customizer Joe Filisko, this plate helps reduce any rattle caused by the low frequency tone produced by the reeds. It is available in low major keys A through F, as well as low B-flat and E-flat, and double-low F.

The Marine Band 364 has twelve holes and is available is the natural keys of C, G, and D only.

The Marine Band 365 has fourteen holes and is available in keys C and G only.

The Marine Band Soloist (364s) is the same as a twelve-hole chromatic harmonica without a button. Available in key of C.

The Marine Band 365 Steve Baker Special (365/28 SBS) possesses the same construction as the original 365, but with low pitched tuning to their natural major keys, available in C, D, G, A, and F. It is named for, and was developed in part by noted harmonicist Steve Baker, who resides in Germany and has contributed to the design of several other Hohner harmonica models, including the Marine Bands Deluxe and Crossover.

The Marine Band Octave has two rows of reeds tuned an octave apart. Available in the keys of C and G.

===Modular harmonica system===
In the mid-1990s, responding to the competing new Lee Oskar Harmonica System by Tombo, Hohner introduced an interchangeably parted series known as the Modular System, usually abbreviated MS. Over the years, several harps have been added to this system.

The Blues Harp has been around since the early 1970s. Until the 1990s, it was functionally identical to the Marine Band, the only differences being the cover plates and the varnish on the front of the wood comb, and the Blues Harp&#x27;s profile was thinner as well. At one point, Johnny Cash promoted the Blues Harp. In the 1990s, Hohner made the Blues Harp part of its Modular System (MS) line. This new Blues Harp lost its uniqueness, and is interchangeable with the other models in the MS line, but it currently remains the standby of many players who use MS harps.

The Pro Harp features lacquer-coated cover plates with a glossy black finish and a plastic comb. Since its inception, it has become a very popular model among rock and roll players. The Pro Harp was another model that was in Hohner&#x27;s handmade line of harmonicas, and was later adapted to the modular system.

The Cross Harp was a nearly identical model to the Pro Harp with the exception of a wood comb and slightly thicker original reed plates. The black coverplate coating was greblon. It was discontinued in 2011.

The Big River Harp was introduced as a less expensive alternative to the Blues Harp. It is favored among beginner harmonicists, although many experienced players also prefer the Big River for its higher natural volume. It features a plastic comb and bare metal cover plates.

The Blue Midnight was released in 2011 with a limit to the key of C, also on the less expensive side of the market. It features stainless steel cover plates with a wider back gap for enhanced volume while playing. The unique feature of this harp is the comb, which is made out of translucent blue plastic. The comb allows for brighter tone than the black combed models. It also has a special just intonation (JI) &quot;Chicago tuning&quot;. It is also now available in other keys.

The 225 - Deuce and a Quarter was a limited edition harmonica on the modular system that was put out in 2007 and 2008. It was made on a black plastic comb, with chrome-plated reedplates, and black powder-coated coverplates with art resembling a vintage car&#x27;s hood-emblem. It was available only in the key of A.

The Meisterklasse is a high-end harmonica featuring chrome-plated cover plates, an anodized aluminium comb, and extra thick 1.05mm nickel-plated reeds. Originally issued as a more compact, unique model, the revised version (still carrying the same 580 model number) is now on the modular system, made in Germany. One other feature that sets the Meisterklasse apart from most other Hohner harmonicas are its full-length cover plates, which extend all the way to the ends of the harmonica&#x27;s comb rather than sharply angling down before the ends to form an adjoining surface parallel to the reedplates and comb. The only other Hohner harmonica possessing this quality is the curve-framed Golden Melody.

===Other diatonic harmonica models===
The Old Standby is another model beloved by generations of harmonica players. Up until the 1990s, this model was a quality instrument made in Germany on a wood comb. Where the Marine Band was the choice of blues players, many country music players such as Charlie McCoy preferred the Old Standby. In the 1990s, Hohner began manufacturing this model in China on a plastic comb with a significant decrease in quality. Among harmonica fans the downgrade remains unpopular.

Golden Melody, designed by Frank and Cham-Ber Huang, has a curved shape. This German-made, plastic-comb model has a slightly different tuning (equal temperament) than other diatonic harmonicas, making the Golden Melody better suited for playing single-note melodies and solos.

The XB-40, (short for Extreme bending-40 reeds), is unlike any other diatonic made. Released in 2003, it was specifically designed by harmonica specialist Rick Epping to simplify proficient bending of the notes. To make this possible, the XB-40 uses forty reeds as opposed to the usual twenty found in most ten-hole diatonics. With these bending capabilities, the XB-40 gives access to all the notes on the chromatic scale through bending the natural tones of each hole. This model was discontinued in 2013. Shortly before production officially ceased, Suzuki Music released a similar model the SUB-30.

The American Ace has been a popular choice as a beginner&#x27;s harmonica for decades. Originally made in Ireland on a wood comb, this model is currently being made in China on a plastic comb.

The Pocket Pal is a recent addition to the Hohner standard line of harmonicas. It is somewhat unusual because it is slightly shorter in length than most harmonicas, leading to its namesake of being pocket handy. It is Chinese made, which is unfavorable to most harmonica players, but the Pocket Pal has caught on as an inexpensive, yet quality harp. Like the Old Standby, the Pocket Pal is designed for use in country music.

38C, also known as the Mini Harp, is Hohner&#x27;s least expensive model. With four holes, the 38C plays a single octave in the key of C. Like other budget harmonicas, the 38C is manufactured in China with a plastic comb.

The Little Lady is very similar to the 38C, but on a pearwood comb and with different cover plate art. It is technically a playable harmonica, but it is generally regarded as a knick-knack piece that can be used as personal jewelry. It is also available as a keychain. The Little Lady holds the distinction of being the first musical instrument to be played in outer space.

==Other harmonica types==
In addition to diatonic harmonicas Hohner also produces other types such as chromatic and tremolo harmonicas.

===Chromatic===

The Chromonica, no longer in production, contained forty reeds and played 2½ full chromatic octaves. This was the original Hohner chromatic model, available until recently in C or G.

The Discovery 48 an entry level chromatic harmonica, aimed at beginners. Contains forty-eight reeds featuring full length cover plates, the same 1.2mm reeds found in the deluxe and a reversible mouth piece.

There is also a Super Chromonica 270 which contains forty-eight reeds and spans three octaves.

The Super Chromonica 270 Deluxe is an updated improvement on the Super Chromonica, featuring tighter reedplate fixtures, thicker reedplates, round holes in its chrome-plated mouthpiece, a smoother slide mechanism which can be remounted for left-handed use, and a round-edged comb for more comfortable holding. The Deluxe is also available with a gold-plated mouthpiece and coverplates, known as the Super Chromonica Gold.

The Educator 10 is a 10-hole, 40-reed chromatic harmonica built on a plastic comb. It is designed without the valve or windsaver technology found in many other chromatics, and because of its ten holes, it is smaller than most chromatics. This makes it a simple and inexpensive chromatic, ideal both for novices and for experienced diatonic players making the transition from the smaller 10-hole harmonicas. Like the Chromonica, it plays full octaves.

The Koch Chromatic and Slide Harp are both designed in the same fashion as chromatic harmonicas, but possess the Richter tuning found in typical 10-hole diatonic harmonicas. Like the Educator 10, both are also 10-hole and built on a pearwood comb. The Slide Harp has been discontinued.

The 64 Chromonica is a four-full-octave harmonica in the key of C. With 64 reeds on a plastic comb, it boasts an extra octave below the middle-C note, giving it an accentuated versatility.

The CX-12 is a 12-hole, 48-reed chromatic, uniquely designed with a one-piece plastic housing and a more ergonomic slide button. It is available in several keys including a tenor-C. The standard model is charcoal black in color, but a gold colored one is available in the key of C only. A variant of the CX-12, the CX-12 Jazz, has slightly different outer body features for better ergonomics, a red and gold colored housing, and higher reed offsets which aid in better tone for jazz harmonica players.

The Meisterklasse chromatic is a very high-end model (7565). It is Hohner&#x27;s premium 14-hole chromatic (56 notes). Like its diatonic sibling, it features an anodized aluminum comb, and chrome-plated brass cover plates and mouthpiece. The cover plates extend the length of the comb. Essentially, it looks like a bigger version of the original diatonic Meisterklasse introduced in the 1980s (but which was later revised for the MS series reed plates).

===Tremolo===
On tremolo harmonicas each channel has two reeds for each note, i.e. one pair for blown notes and another pair for drawn ones, each pair tuned slightly apart from one another to produce a tremolo sound.

The most popular models are either single-sided or double-sided Echo harps, but the single-sided ones can be combined into quadruple or sextuple &#x27;corncob&#x27; setups, with a different key on each row.

===Chord===

The Chord Harmonica consists of two harmonicas hinged together. Together, they are capable of playing 48 chords. They are 23 inches long, and each chord takes up 4 holes. The chord harmonica is used to provide chordal and rhythmic backing in an ensemble, much as rhythm guitar might do. Jerry Murad&#x27;s Harmonicat&#x27;s 1947 &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot; was played on a Chord, with a cleverly arranged sequence of chords that produced the impression of a melody. Hohner&#x27;s main Chord is known as the Hohner 48, because it plays 48 chords. Hohner from the 1930s to the late 1960s also produced the Polyphonia No. 8, which played 36 blow-only chords, in three rows. The concept failed and is often frowned upon by professional 48 chord players.

===150th anniversary and beyond===

For Hohner&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2007, the company began manufacturing Limited Edition Diatonic harmonicas all tuned to the key of C major only.

* Gold limited to 150 pieces.
* Chrome limited to 1,857 pieces.
* Standard Edition

The &quot;Gold Edition&quot; harmonica is based upon the MS reed plates. It features a crystal glass comb and engraved gold-plated cover plates. The bottom cover plate has the serial numbers from 1 to 150. It is packaged in a leather case with an anniversary booklet.

The &quot;Chrome Edition&quot; harmonica is also based upon the MS reed plates. Featuring a crystal glass comb and specially engraved chrome-plated anniversary cover plates. The bottom cover plate has the serial numbers from 1 to 1857. It is also packaged with an anniversary booklet. The &quot;Standard Edition&quot; model features a clear acrylic comb and the top cover plate is specially engraved.

The &quot;Standard Edition&quot; model is presented in 12 piece wooden anniversary boxes.

==Artist series harmonicas==
Hohner has several harmonicas designed by several famous harmonica players.

===Larry Adler===
Classical harmonica player Larry Adler had his own harmonica series, still produced by the company, which were chromatic with either 12 or 16 holes.

===Toots Thielemans===
Jazz player Toots Thielemans also has a chromatic harmonica line with two types being Mellow Tone (for classical material) and Hard Bopper (for contemporary material).

===Stevie Wonder===
Stevie Wonder, plays both Hohner the 64 Chromonica and Super 64 with four-octave range on all his records since the 1960s.

===Steven Tyler===
Aerosmith&#x27;s front man Steven Tyler has two types of diatonic harmonicas. An Artist Series and a Signature Series with the latter being more expensive.

===Bob Dylan===
Folk musician Bob Dylan also has a Signature Series diatonic harmonica as well as a Collection which features seven harmonicas.

==Guitars==

Guitars were produced under the Hohner name from the late 1950s until around 2015 when the company withdrew from the guitar market. During that period, guitars were commissioned or designed by several of the Hohner companies including those in Germany, USA, United Kingdom and France.

===History of guitar production===
The earliest documented Hohner guitars were made for Hohner London (the trading name of the UK subsidiary M. Hohner Ltd.) around 1960. The first guitars were named after London districts (Kingsway, Farringdon) with a second run of guitars having more exotic names (Amazon, Zambezi). By 1962, Hohner London focussed on distributing Kay guitars and production of their own guitars petered out.

The US subsidiary M. Hohner Inc had an existing relationship with the Sano Corporation of New Jersey to make accordion amplifiers under the brand name Contessa. In the 1960s, Sano also imported Zerosette guitars from Italy and they started to be badged as Contessa for sale by Hohner. By the late 1960s, a range of solid body, semi-acoustic and acoustic Contessa guitars were being offered in the US and Europe. Guitars were sourced or commissioned from manufacturers including Eko, Framus and others. Steve Vai&#x27;s first guitar was a Contessa HG-200.

During the early 1970s, production of especially classical and folk guitars continued under the Contessa, Contessa By Hohner and Hohner Contessa names. By 1974 (and probably much earlier) at least some guitars were being sourced from Japan. In 1974, M. Hohner Inc. registered Hohner International as a trademark for use on musical instruments. The Contessa name was dropped with the exception of a small number of classical guitars. From 1975, most guitars had the Hohner name on the headstock and Hohner International branding on the soundhole label of acoustic guitars. Guitars were then produced under the Hohner brand from around 1975 to 2015, when Hohner withdrew completely from the guitar market.

By 1975, guitar production was entirely in Japan. Around 1976, the 300 Limited Edition series and the 700 series acoustic guitars were added to an expanded range of classical, folk, concert and dreadnought guitars. In 1977, a range of electric guitars was introduced consisting mainly of replicas of popular Fender and Gibson guitar and bass models. Some electric guitars were made at the Moridaira factory in Matsumoto, some acoustic guitars were made at the Terada factory, with the remainder made by unidentified factories.

Some acoustic guitar production started to move to Korea as early as 1978 although electric guitar production remained in Japan until at least 1983. By 1985, new ranges of Korean made electric guitars were introduced - the budget SE range (known as the Arbor Series in the United Kingdom) consisting mostly of Fender and Gibson copies; and the Professional range which included headless basses and guitars based on technology licensed from Ned Steinberger as well as the ST (Stratocaster and Superstrat style guitars), TE (Telecaster style guitars, including reissues of the Prince guitar), and L (Les Paul style guitars) models which would form the core of the Professional range for years to come. These guitars were made at the Cor-Tek factory in South Korea, more commonly referred to by their in-house brand Cort Guitars.

In 1990, the English guitar maker Alan Entwistle joined Hohner UK bringing his ATN tone shaping circuitry. In 1991, this was incorporated into the existing ST59 model as the ST59-ATN and into a new model, the JT60-ATN. The popularity of these models allowed Hohner UK to influence guitar production for the next few years, introducing the Revelation series of guitars which were designed in the UK and made at the Delicia factory near Prague and in 1994 setting up a Hohner Custom Shop in Bedwas to produce made to order variations of guitars. To differentiate budget models from the Professional Series and other higher end guitars, the brand Rockwood by Hohner was introduced in the mid-1990s.

===Notable guitar models===

==== Hohner London Kingsway (1960) ====
This is probably the earliest Hohner guitar, dating to the second half of 1960. It features a hollow construction, a birch neck and a single pickup. The pickups and electrics were made by the Weill company who had previously worked with Burns London and assembly was probably by Stuart Darkins, a furniture manufacturing company.

==== HG-320 Limited Edition (1975) ====
The HG-320 was part of the Limited Edition Series of acoustic guitars introduced in 1975 and produced till the early 1980s. It is a dreadnought guitar and the design closely resembles that of a Martin D-41. The guitars were made in Japan and all featured solid spruce tops, rosewood or maple backs, and highly decorative inlays and marquetry. Later models were probably made at the Terada factory but the earliest guitars show some differences and could have been made by smaller luthier shops.

==== HG-490 (1977) ====

The HG-490 was a version of the HS Anderson HS-1 Mad Cat made for Hohner by the Moridaira/Morris factory in Japan around 1977. They were largely a copy of a Fender Telecaster in configuration, but the body is an unusual construction using a Birds&#x27; eye maple cap either side of a walnut strip and the guitar has decorative binding and leopard print pickguards. They sold for around 80,000 yen or $800.

Musician Prince bought a Hohner HG-490 guitar in the late 1970s and it was said to have been his favourite guitar. Although very few original models were made, Hohner and others have since made many other versions starting in the early 1980s. Hohner reissues include Hohner THE Prinz, Hohner TE Prinz and Hohner The Artist HTA490.

Prince himself had multiple luthier copies of the guitar made, some of them indistinguishable from the original. As such, it&#x27;s difficult to be definitive about when he was using an actual Hohner guitar.

==== B2 (1985) ====
The Hohner Professional B2 was a headless bass introduced in 1985. It used a bridge licensed from Steinberger and was available with passive or active pickups, the latter designated B2A, as well as a five-string active version designated B2AV. The B2 proved a popular alternative to the much more expensive Steinberger headless basses and remained in production until at least 2012.

==== JT60 &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1991) ====
The JT60 was designed in the UK but produced in Korea from 1991 to around 1996 and was an offset guitar similar to a Fender Jaguar but with a Fender Stratocaster pickup and control layout. It was designed by Alan Entwistle, who had recently joined Hohner UK, and features Entwistle&#x27;s own ATN tone circuitry to emulate different guitar types. The first production models were displayed at the British Music Fair in June 1991 where orders for it greatly outstripped those of the more conventionally Stratocaster-shaped ST59 ATN model which had been produced because of fears that the JT60 was too unconventionally shaped.

HS Anderson Vintage re-issue Mad Cat (version 1, 2012)

Trying to stay as close as possible to the original specifications. An original ‘70s Mad Cat was used as a reference model, and after extensive testing a worthy successor was born, which even surpasses the original in some regards. Subtle upgrades were performed :Tuners were upgraded to Gotoh SG360 with a higher gear ratio. The original Keiyo pickups were upgraded to Bill Lawrence USA vintage S1/S3.The output jack is more sturdy, so no more signal drop-outsAll other specifications are equal to the ‘70s Mad Cats, we designed these guitars with the highest respect to the sound and feel of this legendary guitar. Each one was hand built in the original Morris factory by Japanese craftsmen, and came with a certificate of authenticity.

A lot happened since the first released the Vintage Re-Issue Mad Cat in 2012. Thanks to feedback from owners of original mad cats, dealers and customers, a lot was learned. Another original Mad Cat from 1984 was acquired, which was the basis for the second version of the Vintage Re-issue model and the Limited Edition Mad Cat.

This specific 1984 Mad Cat has a very comfortable neck profile, with a smooth rounded fingerboard. Since the necks are made by hand, it was fairly easy to adjust to this new neck profile.

The 1984 pickups, although noisy, also sound fantastic. Even in the bridge position, which is positioned in a typical angle, almost parallel to the bridge. Heartbreaker pickups were commissioned to clone the sound of these pickups, but without the noise, and they delivered.

The version 2 Mad Cat ships with a 4-way switch installed, which gives the following combinations :

Position 1 : both pickups in series, Position 2 : neck pickup, Position 3 : both pickups in parallel, Position 4 : bridge pickup

The leopard pickguard material used is more durable than what was used on the original mad cats. Therefore, the recessed output jack was reverted back to the original 70s style jack.

==Accordions==

The Hohner Electravox is an electronic accordion made in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which has one channel (combined left hand and right hand) or two channel (separate left hand and right hand channels, which enables independent volume changes), 92 bass/chord buttons, keyboard percussion effect for the bass buttons and keyboard, a vibrato effect (with slow/fast options), and a separate power supply unit, which sits on the floor. The Electravox had 16&#x27;, 8&#x27;, 5 1/3&#x27;, and 4&#x27; registers. The tuning for the Electravox could be changed to match another instrument, such as a piano or organ, but this required changing all 12 master tone generators with a special tool.

== Notable Hohner players ==

A number of early blues harmonica players throughout the 20th century have been known for using Hohner Marine Band harmonicas because they were the most available at the time. However, as other harmonica companies began to expand and Hohner produced different types of harmonicas, harmonica players started to develop preferences.

*Carlos del Junco – The blues harmonica player is noted for playing a Golden Melody like his mentor Howard Levy.
*Howard Levy – The multigenre harmonica player is noted for playing several different brands but says the Golden Melody is his favorite.
*Jerry Portnoy – The blues harmonica player is primarily a Hohner Marine Band Crossover player since it came out and has given it much praise. He has played with artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Muddy Waters, as well as others.
*John Popper – The lead singer of the jam band Blues Traveler is noted for playing a Special 20. 
*Brandon Santini - The blues, roots-rock harmonica player and vocalist is endorsed by Hohner and plays Hohner Special 20 and Hohner Rocket harmonicas. 
*John Sebastian, Sr. – The late classical harmonica virtuoso was noted for playing a 64 Chromonica. He also worked on improvements to its lower register as a consultant for Hohner.
*John Sebastian – The folk, rock and blues harmonica player has primarily played both Hohner Meisterklasse and Marine Band harmonicas, sometimes with customizations. 
*Neil Young – The rock, country and folk harmonica player is known to play a Hohner Marine Band in the key of G.
*Bobby Darin – The multi-faceted artist released the Blues album &quot;Commitment&quot; in 1969. Several of the album&#x27;s songs (including &quot;Me and Mr. Hohner&quot;) rely heavily on his use of harmonicas.

<doc id="1279488" wikidata="Q722925" url="?curid=1279488" title="Achrafieh">
<text>Achrafieh () is an upper-class area in eastern Beirut, Lebanon. In strictly administrative terms, the name refers to a sector (&quot;secteur&quot;) centred on Sassine Square, the highest point in the city, as well as a broader quarter (&quot;quartier&quot;). In popular parlance, however, Achrafieh refers to the whole hill that rises above Gemmayze in the north and extends to Badaro in the south, and includes the Rmeil quarter.

Although there are traces of human activity dating back to the neolithic era, the modern suburb was heavily settled by Greek Orthodox merchant families from Beirut&#x27;s old city in the mid-nineteenth century. The area contains a high concentration of Beirut&#x27;s Ottoman and French Mandate era architectural heritage. During the civil war, when Beirut was separated into eastern and western halves by the Green Line, Achrafieh changed from a mostly Christian residential area (compared to bustling, cosmopolitan Hamra, in Ras Beirut) to a commercial hub in its own right. In the early 2000s, the area became a focal point of the city&#x27;s real estate boom. 

==Overview==
The etymology of Achrafieh most likely relates to the steep hill that defines the area, although this is contested. The area centers on Beirut&#x27;s highest point, the hill of Saint Dimitrios, and comprises neighbourhoods that slope towards the port in the north, and to what was once a vast pine forest, to the south. The name long predates the present administrative divisions of the Municipality of Beirut, and first appears to designate a suburb in Salih bin Yahya&#x27;s &quot;History of Beirut&quot;, in the early 1400s. The writer Elias Khoury recalls how the area was called the &quot;little mountain&quot; (&quot;al-jabal as-saghir&quot;) by locals, as if it were a small outpost of nearby Mount Lebanon on the coast.

Administratively, Achrafieh today designates a quarter of the city, made up of 9 sectors (Achrafieh, Adlieh, Corniche el-Nahr, Furn el-Hayek, Ghabi, Hotel Dieu, Mar Mitr, Nasra, Sioufi). However, Saint Nicolas and Sursock Street, which are strictly within the quarter of Rmeil, have always been considered part of Achrafieh by local residents and real estate developers alike. Similarly, certain southern parts of the administrative quarter, such as Adlieh, are generally not considered to be part of the area. Achrafieh is therefore defined somewhat nebulously and synonymously with East Beirut.

Achrafieh comprises residential areas characterized by narrow winding streets and cafes along with more commercial areas, with large apartment and office buildings and major arteries between central Beirut and the north-eastern suburbs. The following neighbourhoods are counted within Achrafieh: 

* Accaoui, a hill leading from Gemmayze up to the Sursock neighbourhood
* Furn el-Hayek
* Karm el-Zeitoun, a densely populated settlement that was established by Armenian refugees in the 1920s, who were later joined by Syriac Christians. Syrian &amp; Egyptian laborers (mainly males) as well as domestic migrant workers (mainly females) also reside in the area but live communally in shared apartments to minimize their living expenses
*Mar Mitr, named after the Saint Demetrios Church, hosts one of the city&#x27;s main Greek Orthodox cemeteries
* Mar Naqoula or Saint Nicolas, named after the parish church; includes Sursock Street with its old palatial villas, the St Nicolas Stairs (Escalier de l&#x27;Art) and many office buildings (Sofil Center, Ivory Building)
*Nasra, named after the Dames de Nazareth girls school
*Rue Monot
*Rue Huvelin
* Sassine Square, a busy road intersection atop the Saint Dimitrios hill, roughly coterminous with the Achrafieh sector, named after the Sassine family, the original landowners
*Sodeco Square
* Sioufi, a residential area on the southern slopes of the hill, built on land that was used for hunting in the mid twentieth century; named for the Sioufi family, which established a furniture factory here
* Tabaris Square and Abdel Wahab Street

== History ==
There are traces of human activity on the slopes of Achrafieh in antiquity. The area included a necropolis, with archeological findings now in the National Museum of Beirut, and a possible shrine around a water spring at what is today Saint Demetrios Church.

=== Ottoman period ===
After several centuries of being a small, walled city, Beirut expanded rapidly in the mid-nineteenth century, as a result of increased trade and immigration, including refugees from inter-communal conflicts in Mount Lebanon and inland Syria. As the old city became increasingly cramped and overpopulated, many Greek Orthodox trading families relocated from the port into semi-rural eastern areas, where they built spacious villas on the slopes of the hill, with large gardens and views commanding the port. These Orthodox families (including the Bustros, Gebeily, Trad, Tueni, and Sursock) made their money through the silk trade as well as money exchanging and tax collection, and were some of the largest property owners and tax payers in the city in the 1860s and 70s. The Orthodox community&#x27;s communal institutions followed them. The Greek Orthodox Archbishop&#x27;s palace was also relocated from the Saint George Cathedral complex in downtown Beirut to the Sursock&#x27;s neighbourhood overlooking the port. The Ecole des Trois Docteurs, founded in 1835 in the Orthodox Cathedral complex in central Beirut, moved eastward until it found its present location at the bottom of the Accaoui hill. 

The first palace was built by Nicolas Sursock, probably on what is now the St Nicolas Stairs, and hosted Russia&#x27;s Grand Duke Nicholas when he visited Beirut in 1872. Other villas included: Taswinat al-Tueni, a palace built by Georges Tueni in the early 1860s and named for the fence that ringed the extensive grounds; the Fadlallah Bustros Palace, completed around 1863 and now housing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Moussa Sursock&#x27;s palace, completed around 1870; and Elias Sursock&#x27;s palace, which hosted General Gouraud during the French Mandate and was demolished in the 1960s. The last major villa was built for Nicolas Ibrahim Sursock in 1912, and upon his death, he left the palace to the Municipality of Beirut as a land grant or waqf, to become what is now the Sursock Museum. These palatial villas remain emblematic of Achrafieh, with one such palace, built for Abdullah Bustros, being sold for $22 million in 2018.

Besides the bourgeois families, many Christian refugees came to settle in the expanding suburbs, starting with the 1860 inter-communal conflict in Mount Lebanon, between Maronites and Druze, and in Damascus, between Orthodox Christians and Muslims. Dimitri Youssef Debbas was one such refugee from the Damascus conflict, who settled in Achrafieh and wrote a memoir of the conflict. Historian Leila Fawaz describes how Dimitri Debbas was part of the first caravan fleeing Damascus, and placed into quarantine outside the city. The Bustros family persuaded the Mutessarif to allow the refugees into the town, and they were housed in the Ecole des Trois Docteurs, near the St George Cathedral. As the school became overcrowded, some were given shelter in Khalil Sursock&#x27;s house, with families staying in the cellar, and men (including Dimitri Debbas) sleeping in the open. Dimitri Debbas, who had been part of a successful business family in Damascus, rebuilt his wealth from Beirut and built a residence of his own in Achrafieh, on what is now known as Montee Debbas.

=== Lebanese Civil War ===

Given its large Christian population, Achrafieh was a focal point of conflict during the Lebanese Civil War. The area was the Beirut heartland of the Christian militias under the Lebanese Front. The Hundred Days&#x27; War in 1978 saw the Christian militias of the Lebanese Front fight the Syrian deterrent forces. In 1982, Lebanon&#x27;s president-elect Bachir Gemayel was assassinated by a bomb explosion at the Kataeb office on Sassine Street. The documentary &quot;Beirut: The Last Home Movie&quot; (1987) by Jennifer Fox shows the day-to-day life of the Bustros family, inside the Tueni-Bustros palace during the early 1980s. Mouna Bustros, who features in the film, was killed in 1989 when a rocket was fired from the nearby Rizk Tower at the palace. The Achrafieh experience of the war is also chronicled by Elias Khoury in his novel &quot;The Little Mountain&quot; (1989).

=== Contemporary Achrafieh ===
In 2005, journalist Samir Kassir was assassinated by a bomb placed under his car at his residence in Achrafieh.

In 2006, as part of the unrest surrounding the Danish cartoons of Muhammad, protestors torched the Danish embassy building in Tabaris and damaged the nearby Mar Maroun Church in Saifi. 

In October 2012, Wissam al-Hassan, head of the Intelligence Branch of Lebanon&#x27;s Internal Security Force, was killed along with 8 others by a bomb on Sassine Street.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Christians made up 83.34% and Muslims made up 15.28% of registered voters in Achrafieh. 26.84% of the voters were Greek Orthodox, 14.39% were Maronite Catholics, 13.47% were Armenian Orthodox, 11.59% were Greek Catholics, 11.45% were Sunni Muslims and 5.00% were Syriac Orthodox.

== Urbanism ==

Achrafieh contains some of Beirut&#x27;s largest remaining clusters of historic buildings from the late Ottoman and French Mandate periods. However, much of this heritage was destroyed during the Civil War (1975–1990), with many structures undergoing reconstruction in the following decades. The area also saw several construction booms (including during the Civil War, in the mid-1990s, and the 2000s), during which much of the built heritage including gardens was replaced with tower blocks to maximize land value. Heritage buildings have been torn down for inheritance reasons, as a way of evicting tenants on so-called &quot;old rents&quot;, or because of lack of maintenance.

The area now contains the tallest towers in Beirut, including Sama Beirut near Sodeco, and SkyGate near Sassine Square. The area around Sursock Street has been rebranded by developers as a &quot;golden triangle&quot; (&quot;triangle d&#x27;or&quot;), as it has a balance between permissible population density and development rights (e.g., height of buildings). In 2003 ABC Achrafieh department store and shopping mall was built on what was Salam football field.

The built environment was badly affected by the explosion at Beirut&#x27;s port in 2020, particularly in the northern parts of Achrafieh. An emergency law was promulgated in the immediate aftermath to stop the sale of land and evictions from houses around the port for the following two years. Several civil society organizations, most notably the Beirut Heritage Initiative, have been working to restore groups of houses affected by the disaster.

Very few of the remaining heritage buildings have any official protection, despite lobbying from civil society groups. A new bill was passed in 2017 by the Lebanese government to protect heritage sites around the city, marking a historical turning point for activists who have pressed for legislative action since the end of the war, but has not been ratified.

<text>The Mississippian culture were collections of Native American societies that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 to 1600 CE, varying regionally. It was known for building large, earthen platform mounds, and often other shaped mounds as well. It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages linked together by loose trading networks. The largest city was Cahokia, believed to be a major religious center, located in what is present-day southern Illinois.

The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley (for which it is named). Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point. Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539–1540 (when Hernando de Soto explored the area), with notable exceptions being Natchez communities. These maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.

==Cultural traits==

A number of cultural traits are recognized as being characteristic of the Mississippians. Although not all Mississippian peoples practiced all of the following activities, they were distinct from their ancestors in the adoption of some or all of these traits.
#The construction of large, truncated earthwork pyramid mounds, or platform mounds. Such mounds were usually square, rectangular, or occasionally circular. Structures (domestic houses, temples, burial buildings, or other) were usually constructed atop such mounds.
#Maize-based agriculture. In most places, the development of Mississippian culture coincided with the adoption of comparatively large-scale, intensive maize agriculture, which supported larger populations and craft specialization.
#Shell-tempered pottery. The adoption and use of riverine (or more rarely marine) shells as tempering agents in ceramics.
#Widespread trade networks extending as far west as the Rocky Mountains, north to the Great Lakes, south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Atlantic Ocean.
#The development of the chiefdom or complex chiefdom level of social complexity.
#The development of institutionalized social inequality.
#A centralization of control of combined political and religious power in the hands of few or one.
#The beginnings of a settlement hierarchy, in which one major center (with mounds) has clear influence or control over a number of lesser communities, which may or may not possess a smaller number of mounds.
#The adoption of the paraphernalia of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC), also called the Southern Cult. This is the belief system of the Mississippians as we know it. SECC items are found in Mississippian-culture sites from Wisconsin (see Aztalan State Park) to the Gulf Coast, and from Florida to Arkansas and Oklahoma. The SECC was frequently tied into ritual game-playing, as with chunkey.

The Mississippians had no writing system or stone architecture. They worked naturally occurring metal deposits, such as hammering and annealing copper for ritual objects such as Mississippian copper plates and other decorations, but did not smelt iron or practice bronze metallurgy.

==Chronology==
The Mississippian stage is usually divided into three or more chronological periods. Each period is an arbitrary historical distinction varying regionally. At a particular site, each period may be considered to begin earlier or later, depending on the speed of adoption or development of given Mississippian traits. The &quot;Mississippian period&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;Mississippian culture&quot;. The Mississippian period is the chronological stage, while Mississippian culture refers to the cultural similarities that characterize this society.

*The Early Mississippian period (–1200) had just transitioned from the Late Woodland period way of life (500–1000). Different groups abandoned tribal lifeways for increasing complexity, sedentism, centralization, and agriculture. Production of surplus corn and attractions of the regional chiefdoms led to rapid population concentrations in major centers.
*The Middle Mississippian period (–1400) is the apex of the Mississippian era. The expansion of the great metropolis and ceremonial complex at Cahokia (in present-day Illinois), the formation of other complex chiefdoms, and the spread and development of SECC art and symbolism are characteristic changes of this period. The Mississippian traits listed above came to be widespread throughout the region.
*The Late Mississippian period (–1540) is characterized by increasing warfare, political turmoil, and population movement. The population of Cahokia dispersed early in this period (1350–1400), perhaps migrating to other rising political centers. More defensive structures are often seen at sites, and sometimes a decline in mound-building and large-scale, public ceremonialism. Although some areas continued an essentially Middle Mississippian culture until the first significant contact with Europeans, the population of most areas had dispersed or were experiencing severe social stress by 1500. Along with the contemporaneous Ancestral Pueblo peoples, these cultural collapses coincide with the global climate change of the Little Ice Age. The Little Ice Age led to a period of cold-season-like conditions which reduced effective moisture from 1200 to 1800, consistent with the population decline of Cahokia from 1200 and its abandonment from 1350 to 1400. Scholars theorize drought and the reduction of maize agriculture, together with possible deforestation and overhunting by the concentrated populations, forced them to move away from major sites. This period ended with European contact in the 16th century.

==Regional variations==

===Middle Mississippian===

The term &quot;Middle Mississippian&quot; is also used to describe the core of the classic Mississippian culture area. This area covers the central Mississippi River Valley, the lower Ohio River Valley, and most of the Mid-South area, including western and central Kentucky, western Tennessee, and northern Alabama and Mississippi. Sites in this area often contain large ceremonial platform mounds, residential complexes and are often encircled by earthen ditches and ramparts or palisades.

Middle Mississippian cultures, especially the Cahokia polity located near East St. Louis, Illinois, were very influential on neighboring societies. High-status artifacts, including stone statuary and elite pottery associated with Cahokia, have been found far outside of the Middle Mississippian area. These items, especially the pottery, were also copied by local artists.

* Cahokia (fl. 1050–1350 CE): The largest and most complex Mississippian site and the largest Pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico, Cahokia is considered to have been the most influential of the Mississippian culture centers. Discoveries found at the massive site include evidence of copper working (Mound 34), astronomy (Cahokia Woodhenge and the symbolic maximum southern moon rise aligned Rattlesnake Causeway), and ritual retainer burials (Mound 72).
* Angel Mounds: A chiefdom in southern Indiana near Evansville. It is thought by some archaeologists that the Late Mississippian Caborn-Welborn culture developed from the Angel phase people around 1400 and lasted to around 1700 CE.
* Kincaid site: A major Mississippian mound center in southern Illinois across the Ohio River from Paducah, Kentucky.
* Moundville: Ranked with Cahokia as one of the two most important sites at the core of the Mississippian culture, located near Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
* The Parkin site: The type site for the &quot;Parkin phase&quot;, an expression of Late Mississippian culture, believed by many archaeologists to be the province of Casqui visited by Hernando de Soto in 1542.

===South Appalachian Mississippian===

The term &quot;South Appalachian Province&quot; was originally used by W. H. Holmes in 1903 to describe a regional ceramic style in the southeast involving surface decorations applied with a carved wooden paddle. By the late 1960s, archaeological investigations had shown the similarity of the culture that produced the pottery and the midwestern &quot;Mississippian pattern&quot; defined in 1937 by the Midwestern Taxonomic System.

In 1967, James B. Griffin coined &quot;South Appalachian Mississippian&quot; to describe the evolving understanding of the peoples of the Southeast. South Appalachian Mississippian area sites are distributed across a contiguous area including Alabama, Georgia, northern Florida, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina, and Tennessee. Chronologically this area became influenced by Mississippian culture later than the Middle Mississippian area (about 1000 as compared to 800) to its northwest. It is believed that the peoples of this area adopted Mississippian traits from their northwestern neighbors.

Typical settlements were located on riverine floodplains and included villages with defensive palisades enclosing platform mounds and residential areas. Etowah and Ocmulgee in Georgia are both prominent examples of major South Appalachian Mississippian settlements. Both include multiple large earthwork mounds serving a variety of functions.

Villages with single platform mounds were more typical of the river valley settlements throughout the mountainous area of southwest North and South Carolina and southeastern Tennessee that were known as the historic Cherokee homelands. In Western North Carolina for example, some 50 such mound sites in the eleven westernmost counties have been identified since the late 20th century, following increased research in this area of the Cherokee homeland.

===Caddoan Mississippian===

The Caddoan Mississippian area, a regional variant of the Mississippian culture, covered a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeastern Texas, and northwestern Louisiana. Archaeological evidence has led to a scholarly consensus that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present, and that the Caddo and related Caddo language speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact are the direct ancestors of the modern Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.

The climate in this area was drier than areas in the eastern woodlands, hindering maize production, and the lower population on the plains to the west may have meant fewer neighboring competing chiefdoms to contend with. Major sites such as Spiro and the Battle Mound Site are in the Arkansas River and Red River Valleys, the largest and most fertile of the waterways in the Caddoan region, where maize agriculture would have been the most productive. The sites generally lacked wooden palisade fortifications often found in the major Middle Mississippian towns. Living on the western edge of the Mississippian world, the Caddoans may have faced fewer military threats from their neighbors. Their societies may also have had a somewhat lower level of social stratification.

The Caddoan people were speakers of one of the many Caddoan languages. These languages once had a broad geographic distribution, but many are now extinct. The modern languages in the Caddoan family include Caddo and Pawnee.

Hernando de Soto led an expedition into the area in the early 1540s, he encountered several native groups now thought to have been Caddoan. Composed of many tribes, the Caddo were organized into three confederacies, the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches, which were all linked by their similar languages.

===Plaquemine Mississippian===
The Plaquemine culture was an archaeological culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Good examples of this culture are the Medora site (the type site for the culture and period) in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and the Anna, Emerald Mound, Winterville and Holly Bluff sites located in Mississippi. Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture at the Cahokia site near St. Louis, Missouri. It is considered ancestral to the Natchez and Taensa Peoples.
*Emerald Mound: A Plaquemine Mississippian period archaeological site located on the Natchez Trace Parkway near Stanton, Mississippi. The site dates from the period between 1200 and 1730. The platform mound is the second-largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the country, after Monks Mound at Cahokia.
*Grand Village of the Natchez: The main village of the Natchez people, with three mounds. The only mound site to be used and maintained into historic times.

==Known Mississippian settlements==

Although the Mississippian culture was heavily disrupted before a complete understanding of the political landscape was written down, many Mississippian political bodies were documented and others have been discovered by research.

==Related modern nations==

Mississippian peoples were ancestral to the majority of the American Indian nations living in this region when European trade began. The historic and modern day American Indian nations believed to have descended from the overarching Mississippian culture include: the Alabama, Apalachee, Arikara, Caddo, Chickasaw, Catawba, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Ho-Chunk, Houma, Iowa, Kansa, Koroas, Missouria, Mobilian, Natchez, Omaha, Osage (possibly), Otoe, Pawnee, Ponca, Quapaw (possibly), Seminole (broad origins), Taensas, Tunicas, Yamasee, Yazoos, and Yuchi.

==Contact with Europeans==
Scholars have studied the records of Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition of 1539–1543 to learn of his contacts with Mississippians, as he traveled through their villages of the Southeast. He visited many villages, in some cases staying for a month or longer. The list of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition chronicles those villages. Some encounters were violent, while others were relatively peaceful. In some cases, de Soto seems to have been used as a tool or ally in long-standing native feuds. In one example, de Soto negotiated a truce between the Pacaha and the Casqui.

De Soto&#x27;s later encounters left about half of the Spaniards and perhaps many hundreds of Native Americans dead. The chronicles of de Soto are among the first documents written about Mississippian peoples and are an invaluable source of information on their cultural practices. The chronicles of the Narváez expedition were written before the de Soto expedition; the Narváez expedition informed the Court of de Soto about the New World.

After the destruction and flight of the de Soto expedition, the Mississippian peoples continued their way of life with little direct European influence. Indirectly, however, European introductions dramatically changed these native societies. Because the natives lacked immunity to infectious diseases unknowingly carried by the Europeans, such as measles and smallpox, epidemics caused so many fatalities that they undermined the social order of many chiefdoms. Some groups adopted European horses and changed to nomadism. Political structures collapsed in many places.

At Joara, near Morganton, North Carolina, Native Americans of the Mississippian culture interacted with Spanish colonizers of the Juan Pardo expedition, who built a base there in 1567 called Fort San Juan. Expedition documentation and archaeological evidence of the fort and Native American culture both exist. The soldiers were at the fort about 18 months (1567–1568) before the natives killed them and destroyed the fort. (They killed soldiers stationed at five other forts as well; only one man of 120 survived.) Sixteenth-century Spanish artifacts have been recovered from the site, marking the first European colonization in the interior of what became the United States.

By the time more documentary accounts were being written, the Mississippian way of life had changed irrevocably. Some groups maintained an oral tradition link to their mound-building past, such as the late 19th-century Cherokee. Other Native American groups, having migrated many hundreds of miles and lost their elders to diseases, did not know their ancestors had built the mounds dotting the landscape. This contributed to the myth of the Mound Builders as a people distinct from Native Americans, which was rigorously debunked by Cyrus Thomas in 1894.

<text>Fort Macleod ( ) is a town in southern Alberta, Canada. It was originally named Macleod to distinguish it from the North-West Mounted Police barracks (Fort Macleod, built 1874) it had grown around. The fort was named in honour of the then Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police, Colonel James Macleod. Founded as the Municipality of the Town of Macleod in 1892, the name was officially changed to the already commonly used Fort Macleod in 1952.

== History ==

The fort was built as a square on October 18, 1874. The east side held the men&#x27;s quarters and the west side held those of the Mounties. Buildings such as hospitals, stores and guardrooms were in the south end. Stables and the blacksmith&#x27;s shop were in the north end.

The town grew on the location of the Fort Macleod North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) Barracks, the second headquarters of the NWMP after Fort Livingstone was abandoned in 1876. Fort Macleod was originally established in 1874 on a peninsula along the Oldman River, then moved in 1884 to the present town location. The Museum of the North-West Mounted Police is located in Fort Macleod.

Once agricultural settlement and the railway came to the region, Macleod boomed. The town became a divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway and frontier wood construction began to be replaced by brick and sandstone. In 1906 a fire devastated the downtown and destroyed most of the wooden buildings. From 1906 to 1912 Macleod had its greatest period of growth, as more new brick and stone building replaced the destroyed wooden ones. Then in 1912 the CPR moved the divisional point and 200 jobs to Lethbridge, devastating the local economy. Fort Macleod ceased to grow, and in 1924 was forced to declare bankruptcy. Until the 1970s, the town&#x27;s economy stagnated and the buildings from the turn-of-the-century remained untouched.

In 1978 Alberta Culture started to inventory the downtown buildings, and in 1982 the downtown became Alberta&#x27;s first &quot;Provincial Historic Area&quot;. As well, Heritage Canada started a Main Street Restoration Project in 1982, aiming to preserve the sandstone and brick buildings, some dating back to 1878.

<text>The Preston &amp; Northcote Community Hospital (often referred to as PANCH) was a former hospital located in Preston, Victoria, Australia, opened in 1958 and relocated to the Northern Hospital in Epping in February 1998. PANCH was located on the corner of Bell and Hotham Streets. The site was sold off in April 1999, and part of the site is now occupied by Bell City Centre which is a residential facility, student accommodation and host of two hotels a part of the Mantra Group.

Fixtures from the hospital were removed by volunteers to help rebuild a community hospital in Suai, East Timor. The hospital&#x27;s former operating theatres were used for a play on genetic engineering named &quot;The Teratology Project&quot; in 2002.

A new facility called the PANCH Health Service was established in 2003 by the State Government to address a shortage of medical services in the area. This State Government health service, which is located opposite the old PANCH site, is named out of nostalgia and is not directly connected with the former Preston &amp; Northcote Community Hospital.

<text>The National Council for the Defense of DemocracyForces for the Defense of Democracy (, CNDD–FDD) is the major political party in Burundi. During the Burundian Civil War, the CNDD–FDD was the most significant rebel group active and became a major political party in Burundi. The party&#x27;s rule has been described as authoritarian.

CNDD–FDD&#x27;s youth wing is known as the &quot;Imbonerakure&quot;. Human Rights Watch has documented claims that members of Imbonerakure have harassed, arbitrarily detained, tortured, and killed alleged members of opponent parties and militias on behalf of the country&#x27;s security forces, especially since Évariste Ndayishimiye became the president in 2020.

== History ==
During the civil war, the CNDD was the political wing of the organization, while the FDD was the military wing. The original CNDD was founded in 1994, a year after the first democratically elected President Melchior Ndadaye was killed by elements of Burundi&#x27;s Tutsi-dominated army in a failed coup d&#x27;etat. The political wing was dominated by Hutu intellectuals from the southern region of Bururi led by Léonard Nyangoma, while the armed wing was made up of troops drawn from across the country. During the war, the group was often referred to simply by the name of the armed wing (FDD).

In May 1998, Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, Nyangoma&#x27;s chief of staff, caused a schism by ousting the latter over leadership issues and losses suffered by the group during the First Congo War, the Nyangoma-led faction later taking a seat at the Arusha negotiations, while Ndayikengurukiye&#x27;s faction carried out its fight. In 2001, the CNDD– FDD consisted of about 25,000 rebels, but in September of that year Ndayikengurukiye was ousted by a faction led by Pierre Nkurunziza over the former&#x27;s handling of negotiations with the government to join the transitional administration set up by in Arusha Accords. The Nkurunziza-led faction, consisting of 20,000 to 22,000 troops signed a ceasefire with the government in December 2002 but continued fighting. The faction led by Ndayikengurukiye became the lesser of the two with about 5,000 fighters. It also signed a ceasefire with the government in October 2002 to which it has roughly held.

At an official ceremony in January 2005, the group registered as a legal political party. Months later, in the largely peaceful parliamentary elections on 4 July 2005, the CNDD–FDD won an estimated 60 to 80 percent of the vote, making it likely that a CNDD–FDD representative would be chosen the president in August. Pierre Nkurunziza indeed was elected President of Burundi unopposed on August 19. At the legislative elections, the party won 57.8% and 64 out of 118 seats.

In March 2012, Pascal Nyabenda was elected as President of CNDD–FDD. Then on 20 August 2016, General Évariste Ndayishimiye was, in the extraordinary congress that took place in Gitega, elected as the Secretary General of the Party.

In June 2020, Nkurunziza died while still serving as President of Burundi and was succeeded by Ndayishimiye. Prior to Nkurunziza&#x27;s death, Ndayishimiye had been elected President of Burundi in elections which were held in May 2020. Former Senate president Révérien Ndikuriyo, a hardliner, was chosen as the Secretary General of the CNDD–FDD in January 2021.

<text>An obrom is a type of musical instrument in the percussion family, originating in Nigeria. Formed from one large piece of wood, often a log of paduc, the obrom has two recesses connected to each other by a small channel. This is why it is sometimes referred to as a slit dum. The obrom, when struck with mallets near the recesses, plays two to four tones; these are generally alternated in a repetitive beat, or played in an ostinato. It was used as an instrument for communication, transferring messages in a way similar to morse code.

<text>Theodore Bernard Kluszewski (September 10, 1924 – March 29, 1988), nicknamed &quot;Big Klu&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, best known as a power-hitting first baseman for the Cincinnati Reds teams of the 1950s. He played from 1947 through 1961 with four teams in Major League Baseball (MLB), spending 11 of those 15 seasons with the Reds, and became famous for his bulging biceps and mammoth home runs.

Kluszewski was a four-time National League (NL) All-Star who hit at least .300 seven times, and 40 or more home runs in three consecutive seasons. He retired with a .298 lifetime batting average, 279 home runs, and 1,028 runs batted in (RBI) in 1,718 games.

On August 25, 1959, the Chicago White Sox acquired Kluszewski from the Pittsburgh Pirates in return for pitcher Robert Sagers and outfielder Harry Simpson. The veteran hit .297 in 31 games and helped the &quot;Go-Go White Sox&quot; clinch the American League pennant. In six games versus the Los Angeles Dodgers in that year&#x27;s World Series, Kluszewski hit .391 with three home runs and drove in 10 runs.

Kluszewski ranks among the all-time Reds leaders in home runs (sixth), slugging percentage (sixth), on-base plus slugging percentage (eighth), and RBIs (ninth). His .642 slugging percentage, 1.049 OPS, and home run rate of one per 11.4 at-bats in the 1954 season have been team records for seven decades. In 1962, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

==Early life and athletic success==
Kluszewski was born of Polish descent in Summit, Illinois, west of Comiskey Park in Chicago, where he played with the White Sox in the 1959 and 1960 seasons. He was a star football and baseball player at Argo Community High School. He went on to Indiana University in Bloomington, where he also played both sports. In 1945, he was part of the Hoosiers football powerhouse that finished with a 9–0–1 record. The same year he hit .443 with their baseball team.

==Minor league career==
Due to wartime travel restrictions, the Cincinnati Reds, who normally held spring training in Tampa, Florida, were forced to train at Indiana University from to . As a student-athlete at the college, Kluszewski drew the attention of Reds groundskeeper Matty Schwab, who saw him launch several balls over an embankment near the baseball diamond, a 500-plus-foot distance that none of the Reds players were able to reach at the plate. Team scouts were similarly impressed, but Kluszewski, who also was a standout tight end on the Hoosiers football squad, was reluctant to sign a contract because he did not want to jeopardize his collegiate eligibility. Instead, he waited until after graduation in .

After Kluszewski produced .325 and .377 batting averages in two minor league seasons, it was only a matter of time for his big promotion.

==Trademark fashion statement==

Not long after the , Kluszewski became a regular early in the 1948 season, his immense strength already was the talk of major league baseball. Asked to name five of the strongest players in baseball, Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher conspicuously left the big first baseman off his list. &quot;(Why not) Kluszewski?&quot; Durocher defended himself. &quot;I&#x27;m talking about human beings!&quot;

Much to the chagrin of team management, Kluszewski made a bold fashion statement when he cut off both sleeves of his jersey. He explained that they constricted his enormous biceps and shoulders and limited his ability to swing a baseball bat freely: &quot;They got pretty upset, but it was either that or change my swing — and I wasn&#x27;t about to change my swing.&quot;

==Major League Career==

=== Cincinnati Reds (1947–1957) ===
In 1947, Kluszewski earned a spot on the Opening Day roster and remained with the Reds in the first month of the season. After a four-month stint at Class AAA Memphis, he returned to the parent club in September. Kluszewski recorded his first hit on Sept. 23 at Crosley Field, an RBI single off Chicago Cubs starter Hank Wyse in the fifth inning. One year later, he nailed down the starter job that would be his for nine seasons.

It wasn&#x27;t long before Kluszewski gained the reputation as one of the most unique hitters of his time, one who combined immense power with the ability to make contact on a consistent basis. In 10 of his 15 major league seasons, the first baseman walked (492) more often than he struck out (365). In 1953, Kluszewski hit 40 homers and struck out a mere 34 times. The following season he upped this to 49 homers against just 35 strikeouts. In 1955 he parked 47 home runs and struck out an even 40 times, the last time a major leaguer has hit 40 homers and struck out 40 or fewer times in the same season.

Kluszewski was his most dominant from through and was named to the National League All-Star roster in each of the four seasons. In that stretch, he hit a total of 171 home runs, more than any player in the big leagues. He also drove in more than 100 runs each season with a league-high of 141 RBI in the campaign.

Also in that period, Kluszewski became the first and only player in MLB history to hit 35 or more homers in four seasons in which he had fewer strikeouts than homers. Only three other major leaguers achieved the feat even twice: Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Johnny Mize, all Hall of Fame members.

Despite somewhat limited range, Kluszewski was a capable defender who combined sure hands with nimble footwork in the field. He led National League first basemen in fielding percentage five straight years (1951–1955), a major league record. In 1,479 games, he compiled a career .993 fielding percentage, which ranked 92nd in major league history at the start of the 2021 season.

Kluszewski had his most dominant season in 1954, when he was the NL Most Valuable Player runner-up. He was in contention for the elusive Triple Crown for much of the season, leading the league in home runs (49) and RBI (141) and finishing fifth in batting average (.326). As late as September 19, he trailed New York Giants star Willie Mays by only eight points (.341–.333) in the batting race. Kluszewski went into a 3-of-20 tailspin down the stretch, while Mays held steady to secure the crown.

In 1956, Kluszewski was headed toward a fourth straight 40-home run season, but after a back issue flared up in September, he hit only .202 and two home runs in the month. He aggravated the injury early in the next season and spent most of the first four weeks as a pinch-hitter. While Kluszewski weighed his medical options, many of his fans offered get-well wishes and &quot;sure cures&quot; for what ailed him.

&quot;On Opening Day, I made a sudden, quick movement to field a ball and the pain was unbearable,&quot; Kluszewski recalled. &quot;Finally, it was decided that I had a slipped disc. Some doctors recommended an operation and some didn&#x27;t. But none would assure me that I would still have as much mobility and I decided against going under the knife.&quot;

Kluszewski returned to action on June 12 but was slow to recover. After six consecutive starts, he returned to a pinch-hit role for the remainder of the season. When the veteran was traded after the season, he was widely considered to be the greatest left-handed hitter and among the best fielding first baseman in Reds history. The organization retired his uniform number 18 in a pre-game ceremony on July 18, 1998, at Cinergy Field.

=== Pittsburgh Pirates (1958–1959) ===
On December 28, , Kluszewski was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in return for Dee Fondy in a swap of experienced first basemen. In spring training, the 33-year-old reported that his back issues had subsided, which raised hopes that he would approach his former All-Star standards. While the veteran hit a respectable .292 in 100 games, however, the problem persisted and his power numbers were limited as a result. He hit only four home runs in 331 at-bats.

In , Kluszewski appeared in 60 games for the Pirates before he was traded to the Chicago White Sox, who were in the midst of a tight pennant race.

=== Chicago White Sox (1959–1960) ===
When Kluszewski arrived in Chicago, the White Sox had a tenuous two-game lead on the Cleveland Indians in the AL pennant race. Their primary concern was a chronic lack of power, particularly at the left side, where rookie Norm Cash and veteran Earl Torgeson were the only threats to hit an occasional long ball. In Kluszewski, the front office believed it had a potential solution even though all three candidates played the same position. 

“We didn&#x27;t have a regular first baseman,” White Sox pitcher Billy Pierce told Paul Ladewski in a story for the Society for American Baseball Research. “When we got Ted, we all thought it was a very, very good thing for us, because he gave us a strong left-handed hitter with a good reputation. We never thought he was past his prime but that he would help us. We were very glad to have him on our ballclub.”

The trade failed to pay immediate dividends, however, and it was not until his 14th game Kluszewski finally went deep with his new team. He hit a pair of home runs against the Kansas City Athletics in the second game of a doubleheader on Sept. 7 at Comiskey Park. Even though he would not hit another homer in the regular season, Kluszewski fared well enough (.297 batting average) to hold down a starter role.

After the White Sox held off the Indians to claim their first pennant in 40 years, Kluszewski rose to the occasion and then some against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first World Series of his career. In 25 plate appearances, Kluszewski hit .391, with three home runs, two walks, and 10 RBI.

In his first trip to the plate, Kluszewski singled off starter Roger Craig to give the White Sox a 1–0 lead in the first inning. He triggered a seven-run onslaught two innings later with a towering drive that landed in the lower deck in right field, a three-run homer which knocked Craig out of the game.

In the fourth, Kluszewski launched his second two-run homer in as many innings, a monstrous shot off reliever Chuck Churn that completed an 11–0 rout. &quot;The Los Angeles right-hander throws a curve ... and Kluszewski lets go with another long salvo to right field ... It&#x27;s a home run into the upper deck!&quot; NBC Radio broadcaster Byrum Saam exclaimed. &quot;Pandemonium breaks loose in Chicago on the South Side!&quot;

The Dodgers pitched more carefully to Kluszewski from that point on, as they elected to take their chances against Sherm Lollar and Al Smith behind him in the order. They won four of the next five games and the series, but not before the first baseman hit another homer in the final contest.

Before the series, local automobile mogul Jim Moran offered a free car to any White Sox player who hit a home run. As he recalled in a 2005 interview with Mike Downey of the Chicago Tribune, Kluszewski received three original 1960 Ford Falcons when all was said and done.

In 1960, Kluszewski was the Opening Day starter at first base, although the veteran was unable to discover his magic of the previous postseason and served primarily a pinch-hitter in the final four months of the season.

The farewell season for Kluszewski in Chicago was not without an unusual major league record, though. White Sox owner Bill Veeck introduced uniforms with the player&#x27;s last name on the back of the jersey, and on a road trip to New York, Kluszewski became the first player to appear in a game with a misspelled name which had a backwards &quot;z&quot; as well as an &quot;x&quot; instead of the second &quot;k&quot;.

When Major League Baseball expanded in the season, the White Sox left the 36-year-old Kluszewski unprotected in the expansion draft. The Los Angeles Angels chose him at the 45th overall pick, the second first baseman taken, on the belief he would be a good fit for the short power alleys of that city&#x27;s minor league Wrigley Field the team would use for its inaugural season.

=== Los Angeles Angels (1961) ===
Kluszewski continued to be slowed by back and leg problems in the 1961 season, but his last hurrah produced several historic firsts.

In a telephone interview on the eve of the season opener against the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Kluszewski was asked about his expectations. “If that Milt Pappas is pitching, I&#x27;ll do alright,&quot; The Sporting News quoted him. &quot;I’ve always been able to hit him.&quot;

On April 11, with Albie Pearson on first base, Kluszewski stepped to the plate against Pappas in the first inning before hitting a drive deep into the right-field bleachers for the first home run in franchise history. Don Wells called the home run on the Angels radio broadcast:

The Angels went on to win their first game by a 7–2 count. One inning later, Kluszewski hit his second homer in as many innings, this one off rookie reliever John Papa with two runners on base.

Kluszewski spent the season as part of a lefty-righty platoon with veteran Steve Bilko at first base. He finished the season with a .243 batting average, 15 homers and 39 RBI in 107 games.

=== Career statistics ===
==Personal life==
In 1958, Kluszewski became a partner in Ted Kluszewski&#x27;s Steak House in the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati, a business venture that lasted 21 years. The popular eatery had five locations at both sides of the Ohio River and reportedly served more than 1,000 pounds of beef on a weekly basis.

After his retirement as a player, Kluszewski returned to the Cincinnati Reds as batting coach in 1970 and remained in that capacity for nine seasons. It was under his tutelage that the so-called Big Red Machine became one of the most potent offenses of the expansion era and won consecutive World Series titles in the 1975 and 1976 campaigns.

&quot;There are a lot of coaches who have received more notoriety than Klu, but I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s had more success,&quot; said three-time batting champion Pete Rose, one of his prized pupils. &quot;He was just a prince. I never heard a bad word said about him. He was a nice man, a gentle man.&quot;

In , largely because of health reasons, Kluszewski took on a less strenuous role as the Reds minor league hitting instructor. He served in the position until , when a massive heart attack resulted in emergency bypass surgery that prompted him to leave baseball permanently. On March 29 two years later, the 63-year-old Kluszewski was stricken by a second heart attack and died at a suburban Cincinnati hospital.

<doc id="1279550" wikidata="Q5755230" url="?curid=1279550" title="High Court of Cassation and Justice">
<text>The High Court of Cassation and Justice () is Romania&#x27;s supreme court. It is the equivalent of France&#x27;s Cour de Cassation and serves a similar function to other courts of cassation around the world.

== Naming history ==
It held various names during its existence: &quot;Curtea Supremă&quot; (Supreme Court) and &quot;Tribunalul Suprem&quot; (Supreme Tribunal) during the Communist period (1948–1952 and 1952–1989 respectively), and &quot;Curtea Supremă de Justiție&quot; (Supreme Court of Justice) from 1990 to 2003. The name &quot;Înalta Curte de Casație și Justiție&quot; was re-introduced in 2003, having been also used during the United Principalities (1862–1881) and Kingdom of Romania (1881–1947).

== Administration ==
The court is led by a president, seconded by a vice-president and the leading council. Since September 2019, its president is Corina-Alina Corbu. The general assembly of the court&#x27;s judges assigns two members for the Superior Council of Magistrature. The same assembly approves the annual activity report (released publicly) and the budget of the institution.

According to the law, &quot;The president, the vice-president and the section presidents of the High Court of Cassation and Justice are named by the President of Romania, at the proposal of the Superior Council of Magistrature, out of the judges of the High Court that have worked in at this instance for at least two years&quot;. The term lasts for three years, with the possibility of being renewed once.

== Controversial decisions == 

From 1995 to 2000, the Romanian Supreme Court rehabilitated a total of at least 14 convicted war criminals. These included 3 members of Ion Antonescu&#x27;s wartime government (Nichifor Crainic, Toma Ghițulescu and finance minister Gheron Netta), Radu Dinulescu (&quot;the Eichmann of Romania&quot;) and his deputy (Gheorghe Petrescu) as well as other statesmen and journalists such as former minister Stelian Popescu and Pan M. Vizirescu. A procedure known as &quot;extraordinary appeal&quot; was used to overturn their war crimes and &quot;crimes against peace&quot; convictions. In 2004, the &quot;extraordinary appeal&quot; procedure was eliminated from the Romanian legislation following recommendations from the European Court of Human Rights. This, however, backfired on those who wanted these rehabilitations undone, as Efraim Zuroff came to find out. When, in February 2004, Zuroff demanded that the Romanian authorities overturn the rehabilitations of Colonels Radu Dinulescu and Gheorghe Petrescu, he was informed that this was &quot;technically impossible&quot;. Due to the abolition of &quot;extraordinary appeal&quot;, a decision by the Supreme Court can no longer be challenged within the framework of Romanian legislation.

<text>Liberian Kreyol (also known as Kolokwa or Liberian Kolokwa English) is an Atlantic English-based creole language spoken in Liberia. It was spoken by 1,500,000 people as a second language at the 1984 census, which accounted for about 70% of the population at the time. It is historically and linguistically related to Merico, a creole spoken in Liberia, but it is grammatically distinct from it. There are regional dialects such as the &quot;Kru and Kpelleh kolokwa English&quot; used by the Kru fishermen.

Liberian Kolokwa Language developed from &quot;Liberian Interior Pidgin English&quot;, the Liberian version of West African vernacular English, though it has been significantly influenced by Liberian Settler English, itself based on American English, particularly African-American Vernacular English and Southern American English. Its phonology owes much to the indigenous Languages of Liberia. It has been analyzed having a post-creole continuum. As such, rather than being a pidgin wholly distinct from English, it is a range of varieties that extend from the highly pidginized to one that shows many similarities to English as spoken elsewhere in West Africa. 

Kolokwa originated in Liberia among the Settlers, the free English-speaking African Americans from the Southern United States who emigrated to Liberia between 1819 and 1860. It has since borrowed some words from French and from other West African languages.

Kreyol is spoken mostly as an intertribal lingua franca in the interior of Liberia.

==Grammatical features==
Kreyol uses &quot;no&quot; for negation, &quot;bi&quot; (be) as the copula, &quot;fɔ&quot; for &quot;to&quot; in verbal infinitives.

<doc id="1279566" wikidata="Q2049815" url="?curid=1279566" title="Khadakwasla Dam">
<text>Khadakwasla Dam is a dam on the Mutha River from the centre of the city of Pune in Maharashtra, India. The dam created a reservoir known as Khadakwasla Lake which is the main source of water for Pune and its suburbs.

In the vicinity of Khadakwasla Dam is the National Defence Academy (NDA), the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT), the College of Military Engineering, Pune (CME, Dapodi) and Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS). A few kilometres to the south lies Sinhagad Fort; the twin dams of Panshet and Varasgaon, which mainly supply water for irrigation but also feed into Khadakwasla Lake, lie just due west of the backwaters of Khadakwasla Lake.

Khadakwasla Dam burst at 7:30 am on 12 July 1961, causing the greatest ever disaster to strike Pune. It was not blown up, as some have been led to believe, it simply collapsed at the point of greatest impulsive force, unable to withstand the destructive forces generated by three times the quantity of water gushing in from upstream than it was meant to store at peak capacity as placid water.

== Design ==
The Khadakwasla Dam is long. The dam has been built on the Mutha River, which begins from the confluence of the rivers Ambi and Mose on which the Panshet and Varasgaon Dams are built respectively, and the outflow from Temgarh Lake through Temgarh Dam about north of Varasgaon Dam into Khadakwasla Lake. Mose river has been referred to as Mutha river and shown as such on some maps. The length of the Khadakwasla backwaters is nearly and the width varies from . The maximum depth in the lake is . The dam has 11 radial type sluice gates and six irrigation outlets, flowing into two canals as explained below. Of the three feeder lakes, Varasgaon is the largest, followed by Panshet and Temgarh, in that order. The source of Panshet is close to the base of both Rajgad and Torna Forts and Panshet is the highest of the three, some higher than Khadakwasla. Varasgaon Lake is at the same level as Khadakwasla, and only water released deliberately moves into the Mutha, and then, on to Khadakwasla. Fort Rajgad does not reach the imposing height of Sinhagad Fort, stopping at 2851 feet above sea level.

The Panshet reservoir has a capacity of 2.70 million cubic meters, with Varasgaon reservoir, a larger body, having even more. The Khadakwasla Dam was founded on hard rock. It had a height of above the river bed, with a depth of foundation. Its crest length was and has a free board of . The dam had a flood capacity of 2,775 m3/s and a reservoir of 2.78 million cubic meters. It cannot accept water from both Panshet and Varasgaon together, unless its sluice gates are fully open, causing an overflow of water into Pune, which would perforce allow the waters to end up in the Bhima River and add to water in reverse flow into the Mula River coming East all the way from Mulshi Lake and Dam south of Lonavla, a hill station some west of modern Pune. The plan envisaged control of these three dams to benefit the rapidly expanding city of Pune. The original dam, built in 1879 as a masonry gravity dam founded on hard rock was the first of its kind in the world. This dam was designed by Sir M. Visvesvaraya.

Many people come here on weekends and during the monsoon season. Scenic places around the dam include Peacock Bay, Kudje village and Neelakantheshwar (नीलकंठेश्वर), located near Bahuli village just past Kudje. The Sinhagad road, bordering the dam, has become a favourite picnic spot. There is a &quot;Chowpatty&quot; offering snacks, fast food and non-alcoholic drinks. Peacock Bay, however, is out of bounds to the public at large, being part of the NDA, a Defence Forces establishment.

==Water Quality==

The backwaters of Khadakwasla Lake, right up to Panshet, Temgarh and Varasgaon dams and lakes, as well as the water in the Ambi/Mutha/Mose river/rivulet do not pass through tenanted areas, limiting induction of pollutants to natural levels. There is no discharge of effluents into these water bodies yet. Filtration of such water is therefore easy and the establishments around Khadakwasla Lake get potable water without much effort. In fact, Lavasa minicity, which was being built on the northern fringe of Varasgaon lake had its construction halted by the Bombay High Court on 7 December 2010, due to its proximity to the lake as it was feared that it could lead to progressive contamination of the water supply to Pune. The dams on the lakes are now turning into tourist spots and the outgoing water might suffer a drop in quality, unless controlled.

In a modernisation programme, the two existing canals from Khadakwasla Lake will be upgraded to prevent losses due to evaporation, seepage and theft. The first outbound of the right bank canal will carry water via a tunnel and the land above used for public amenities. The left bank canal that supplies drinking water will now be replaced by a pipeline. The programme envisions all canals in Pune replaced by pipelines. Put together, there will be a huge saving of relatively less polluted water, which will then be used to meet the vastly increased demand in volume of water consequent to the expansion of Pune City. It is a great source of water supply for pune.

== History ==
The birth of Khadakwasla lake took place due to the severe droughts during the 19th century in East Pune that paralysed crop growth and prompted engineers to take up major irrigation works. Captain Fife RE of the British Army recommended a high level reservoir at Khadakwasla in 1863 and subsequently carried out detailed surveys and investigations. This man-made lake was therefore named after him, Lake Fife. It was renamed Khadakwasla Lake shortly after independence. The work on one of the oldest masonry dams of India began in 1869 and was completed in 1879 at the cost of Rs. 65 lakhs (INR 6.5 million, then the equivalent of US$2 million and GB£600,000).
Panshet Dam was nearing completion in July designed to regulate the supply of water to Khadakwasla Lake, in such a manner that the huge reservoir would have more than adequate water for the people of Poona (Pune). The reservoir is the source of water for the two canals referred to above that start at Khadakwasla. The right bank canal is long and irrigates about of land in Pune district and the villages around Haveli, Daund, Indapur and Baramati, while the left bank canal supplies drinking water to Pune, Kirkee and surrounds.

Panshet Dam was zoned at a height of with impervious central core outlet gates located in a trench of the left abutment; hoists were not fully installed when floods occurred at the site of construction. The reservoir had a capacity of 2.70 million cubic meters. Between 18 June – 12 July 1961, the recorded rainfall was , stressing Panshet dam to its limits. The average rainfall for that period is .

Khadakwasla Lake was already 90% full, with water flowing in freely from Varasgaon, besides the abundant rainfall. The people of Pune had no inkling of their fate. The rain caused such a rapid rise of the reservoir water level at Panshet that the new embankment could not adjust to the dangerous loading condition. Water rose at the rate of per day initially, and in 12 days. Due to incomplete rough outlet surface, the flow through was unsteady which caused pressure surges. Cracks were formed along the edges of the right angles to the axis of the dam causing a subsidence wide, leaving the crest of the dam above the reservoir level on 11 July. The failure was attributed to inadequate provision of the outlet facility during emergency. This caused the fateful collapse of the structure above the outlets.

Panshet Dam had been cleared for construction under the aegis of the Bombay State Irrigation Department. When the State split into Maharashtra and Gujarat in 1960, Panshet Dam came under the supervision of Maharashtra State Irrigation Department. Mr. SM Bhalerao was the executive engineer in charge of Panshet dam, and Mr. MR Panse (both deceased), the plant engineer. They were running out of time, since this project was their first major assignment and the area of work hostile. Former secretary of the state irrigation department, Madhukar Deshmukh, who had worked as a deputy engineer at Panshet dam till late 1959, explained what actually went wrong. According to him, the dam was planned as a fully earthen one with a height of . Given the nature of the dam, an outlet to the downstream Khadakwasla reservoir was created at its base. Deshmukh said, &quot;Ideally, the arch of the conduit should have been made from RCC. However, in those days, steel was in short supply and we were forced to use concrete blocks instead.&quot; The force of the water was so great that it managed to dislodge the concrete blocks, which resulted in the earthen portion of the dam giving way. They had made a desperate appeal for help and manpower augmentation, and the Area Commander, Southern Command, Lieutenant-General Chaudhari reacted swiftly, keeping Commandant NDA, Rear Admiral BA Samson in the loop. Assistance was provided using a semi-prepared road from Peacock Bay, NDA to Panshet along the Mutha river/backwaters of Khadakwasla Lake and also via Mulshi Lake. Engineering officers from BEG, College Of Military Engineering (CME) and close to 3,000 personnel moved out just after sunset.

3,000 soldiers from the Bombay Engineer Group and Centre (BEG), the College of Military Engineering (CME) and other units were dispatched by HQ Southern Command, Pune, to help. They formed a human chain at Panshet Dam, as Army and commandeered civil trucks brought sandbags by the tens of thousands to shore up Panshet Dam. The engineers were certain the dam would collapse; they were praying that the Armed Forces personnel&#x27;s aid would delay the inevitable to dawn, so that the people of Pune could be warned in time and those living on the banks of the rivers Mutha and Mula could be evacuated. Despite their best efforts, Panshet Dam caved in at 0330 hrs on 12 July 1961. Khadakwasla Dam was the last barrier. The dam stood firm till well past dawn, contributing to the safety of residents living downstream in the vicinity of the path of least resistance to the surging freestream water.

It took another four hours for Khadakwasla Dam to breach, causing devastating floods in Pune. A central section of the dam gave way. Word had been passed around the few people living on the swampy land next to the two canals early in the morning. The authorities started moving out the residents living near the riverside. Many residents fled to higher grounds, some all the way to the Parvati Hill. Apparently, All India Radio did not broadcast any warnings, and was playing a regular scheduled music program when the floods struck. The low-lying areas of the old city were almost completely submerged. Except for the rail bridge of the Sangam Bridges, two adjacent bridges built separately for rail and road traffic and Bund Garden Bridge, all other bridges were under water as well. Water rushed into the old ‘Peths’ and along Karve Road, Deccan Gymkhana areas. For many hours, the high water levels persisted. Roughly speaking, Panshet water reservoir stores enough water for all of Pune&#x27;s city needs today (today&#x27;s needs are probably 8-10 times more than the requirements of the 1960s).

After the water receded fully, some three days later, the stench of the aftermath of flooding stayed on for nearly three months. A large number of people sold their land and houses at rock-bottom prices and moved away. Pune&#x27;s development plans were put on hold till normalcy was achieved. Bhalerao and Panse were blamed for oversight and lack of common sense in not constructing a wide reinforced archway in the centre of the mudwork dam for water to flow through. The old riverside city landscape changed forever. New localities (such as Lokmanya Nagar, Gokhale Nagar, etc.) were set up to resettle some of the flood affected citizens. Most of the bridges were damaged and needed fixing and in some cases complete rebuilding.

The dam was later rebuilt over four years. In this period, residents of Pune and its suburbs had to face water rationing. While Pune city, Camp and Cantonment area were not too severely affected, people in Khadki (Kirkee), Dapodi, Bopodi, Phugewadi, Hadapsar, Shivajinagar and Deccan Gymkhana had limited water supply. At the National Defence Academy (NDA), Peacock Bay, the Naval cadets training section and the lakeside guest rooms were submerged. The view from the NDA Commandant&#x27;s house, which overlooks the entire lake and dam, was distressing.

<doc id="1279575" wikidata="Q3123530" url="?curid=1279575" title="Islam in Algeria">
<text>Islam is the majority and state religion in Algeria. The vast majority of citizens are Sunni Muslims belonging to Maliki school of jurisprudence, with a minority of Ibadi Muslims, most of whom live in the M&#x27;zab Valley region. Islam provides the society with its central social and cultural identity and gives most individuals their basic ethical and attitudinal orientation. Orthodox observance of the faith is much less widespread and steadfast than is identification with Islam. There are also Sufi philosophies which arose as a reaction to theoretical perspectives of some scholars.

==History==

===Arrival of Islam===
Islam was first brought to Algeria by the Umayyad dynasty following the invasion of Uqba ibn Nafi, in a drawn-out process of conquest and conversion stretching from 670 to 711. The native Berbers were rapidly converted in large numbers, although some Christian and probably pagan communities would remain at least until Almoravid times. However, as in the Middle East itself, they sought to combine their new Islam with resistance to the Caliphate&#x27;s foreign rule - a niche which the Kharijite and Shiite &quot;heresies&quot; filled perfectly. By the late 8th century, most of Algeria was ruled by the Rustamids, who professed the strictly puritanical but politically moderate Ibadhi sect and saw the Caliphs as immoral usurpers. They were destroyed by the Shia Fatimids in 909, but their doctrine was re-established further south by refugees whose descendants would ultimately found the towns of the M&#x27;zab valley in the Algerian Sahara, where Ibadhism still dominates.

Though it convinced the Kutama, the Fatimids&#x27; Ismaili doctrine remained unpopular in most of North Africa, and the Fatimids themselves abandoned Algeria for Egypt as soon as they could, leaving North Africa to a dynasty only nominally subject to them, the Zirids. With the political threat of the Abbasid Caliphate gone, these soon reverted to Sunni Islam - specifically, the Maliki branch, whose popularity had spread widely in the Maghreb. The Fatimids took their revenge by sending the Bedouin Banu Hilal to wreak havoc on the region, but were incapable of controlling it; Shiism rapidly dwindled, and became virtually non-existent in the area.

The Almohads were zealously orthodox, and under their rule Algeria gradually acquired its notable religious homogeneity. Sunni Islam and the Maliki &quot;madhhab&quot; became virtually universal, apart from the Ibadhis of the M&#x27;zab and small Jewish communities.

Islam took longer to spread to the far south of Algeria, whose history is to a large extent separate: only in the 15th century were the Tuareg finally converted to Islam.

During the Regency period, unlike the Maliki Algerian masses, the Ottoman-Algerians remained affiliated with the Hanifi school of Islamic jurisprudence. The judicial system was headed by one mufti for each of the Madhhabs represented in the Regency. Major towns had both Hanafi and Maliki mosques, while the Ibadi community had their own mosques and, especially, cemeteries. The dual Hanafi/Maliki system was maintained under French colonial regime.

===French colonization===

In 1830, the French conquered Algiers. Their attempts to rule the rest of the country met stiff opposition, often religiously inspired: the Sufi warrior Amir Abd al-Qadir was particularly notable for his campaign to keep the French out. Even after his defeat, rebellions continued to be mounted until at least 1870, notably that of Cheikh Mokrani; again, a religious motivation was notable in most, though not all, of these.

Soon after arriving in Algeria, the French colonial regime set about undermining traditional Muslim Algerian culture. By French law Muslims could not hold public meetings, carry firearms, or leave their homes or villages without permission. Legally, they were French subjects, but to become French citizens, with full rights, they had to renounce Islamic law. Few did so. The land of Islamic charitable trusts (&quot;habus&quot;) was regarded as government property and confiscated. Much of the network of traditional Qur&#x27;anic schools and zaouias - regarded with suspicion as centers of potential resistance - collapsed, and the literacy rate fell.

However, the emergence of the religious scholar and reformer Abdelhamid Ben Badis would go some way to reversing these trends. Beginning in the 1910s, he preached against the traditional marabouts and the saint cults, they believed in voodoo dolls, and urged the importance of Arabic and Islamic education; his disciples founded an extensive network of schools, and rapidly brought the saint cults into widespread disrepute, making Algerian Islam substantially more orthodox.

The discrimination against Islam led it to be a strong element of the resistance movement to the French in the Algerian War of Independence. The independence fighters were termed &quot;moudjahidine&quot; - practicers of jihad - and its fallen are called &quot;chouhada&quot;, martyrs, despite the revolution&#x27;s avowed socialism; even during the revolution, the FLN made symbolic efforts to impose Islamic principles, such as banning wine and prostitution.

===After independence===
After independence the Algerian government asserted state control over religious activities for purposes of national consolidation and political control. Islam became the religion of the state in the new constitution (Article 2), and was the religion of its leaders. The state monopolized the building of mosques, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs controlled an estimated 5,000 public mosques by the mid-1980s. Imams were trained, appointed, and paid by the state, and the Friday khutba, or sermon, was issued to them by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. That ministry also administered religious property (the habus), provided for religious education and training in schools, and created special institutes for Islamic learning. Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;) principles were introduced into family law in particular, while remaining absent from most of the legal code; thus, for example, while Muslim women were banned from marrying non-Muslims (by the Algerian Family Code of 1984), wine remained legal.

Those measures, however, did not satisfy everyone. As early as 1964 a militant Islamic movement, called Al Qiyam (values), emerged and became the precursor of the Islamic Salvation Front (Islamist party) of the 1990s. Al Qiyam called for a more dominant role for Islam in Algeria&#x27;s legal and political systems and opposed what it saw as Western practices in the social and cultural life of Algerians. This proved to be the most difficult challenge for the immediate post-independent regimes as they tried to incorporate an Islamic national identity alongside socialist policies. Whereas the new leaders of Algeria saw Islam and Socialism as both compatible and features of Algerian culture and society; radical Islamists saw Islam as the only defining characteristic and in fact incompatible.

Houari Boumediene largely contained militant Islamism during his reign, although it remained throughout the 1970s under a different name and with a new organization. Following Boumediene&#x27;s death, Chadli Bendjedid became president in 1979. Chadli&#x27;s regime was much more tolerant with Islamists, and with Algeria in the midst of an socio-economic crisis including unemployment and inflation, social tensions were high. Policies of Arabization (increasing Arabic education and the use of Arabic in professional institutions) had failed to come to fruition: French remained the language of the political elite and French speaking students were prioritised for jobs. Thus, the movement began spreading to university campuses where it was encouraged by the state as a counterbalance to left-wing student movements. By the 1980s, the movement had become even stronger, and bloody clashes erupted at the Ben Aknoun campus of the University of Algiers in November 1982. The violence resulted in the state&#x27;s cracking down on the movement, a confrontation that would intensify throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The rise of Islamism had a significant impact on Algerian society. More women began wearing the veil, some because they had become more conservative religiously and others because the veil kept them from being harassed on the streets, on campuses, or at work. Islamists also prevented the enactment of a more liberal family code despite pressure from feminist groups and associations.

After the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won the 1991 elections, and was then banned after the elections&#x27; cancellation by the military, the tensions between Islamists and the government erupted into open fighting, which lasted some 10 years in the course of which some 100,000 people were killed. However, some Islamist parties remained aboveground - notably the Movement of Society for Peace and Islamic Renaissance Movement - and were allowed by the government to contest later elections. In recent years, the Civil Harmony Act and Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation have been passed, providing an amnesty for most crimes committed in the course of the war.

==Practice==

Sunni Islam is quasi universal, apart for the Mozabite Berbers who are mainly Ibadhi Muslims. The dominant madhhab is Maliki. There are a few followers of the Hanafi rite among people of Turkish descent. Sufi brotherhoods have retreated considerably, but remain in some areas. Algerians have a Muslim tradition of patron saints, although it is viewed as shirk by Salafis and Wahhabis. The most famous saints who remain local patrons of the cities where their tombs are situated are Sidi Abdel Rahman in Algiers, Sidi el Houari in Oran and Sidi Boumediene at Tlemcen.

==In Politics==
The popularity of Islamism fluctuates according to circumstance; in the 2002 elections, legal Islamist parties received some 20% of the seats in the National Assembly, way down from the FIS&#x27;s 50% in 1991. Conversely, there is strong anti-Islamist sentiment from secular parties such as the RCD and the Algerian Workers Party. Support for Islamist parties is especially low in the Kabylie region, where the FIS obtained no seats in 1991, the majority being taken by the Front of Socialist Forces, another secular party.

The recent rise of a number of radical religious movements involving Ahmadism, Salafism, Wahhabism and takfiri ideology have raised concerns among officials in the Algerian Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments, which has decided to take action by strengthening the monitoring and control of places targeted by the radical Islamists for recruits.

<text>The BMW New Six (also known as the BMW E3) is a line of mid-size luxury sedans and grand tourer coupés produced by the German automaker BMW from 1968 to 1977. All models used the then-new M30 straight-6 engine. It marked BMW&#x27;s return to the full-size luxury sedan market after a hiatus of 5 years and was introduced as a response to growing market segment dominated by Mercedes-Benz. It was important in establishing BMW&#x27;s reputation as a maker of sporting luxury sedans.

The BMW New Six coupés (better known as the [[BMW E9]]) are built on a shortened version of the E3 platform. The E9 coupés share engines, transmissions, some suspension and many other features with the E3 sedans.

A total of 221,991 sedans and coupés were built.

==Development==

After a long hiatus, BMW decided to develop a six-cylinder car in the early 1960s. Work on what was to become the E3 commenced in 1965. The engine was based on the existing M10 inline 4s, sharing their overall layout, though not merely adding two cylinders. The design team was led by Wilhelm Hofmeister, with some detail work executed by Italy&#x27;s Bertone and Michelotti studios. A goal was to offer more passenger space and comfort than the earlier, somewhat smaller New Class saloons had. The new sedan was noticeably a &quot;driver&#x27;s car&quot;, focusing on the front-seat occupants, and the smaller E9 coupé was more of a 2+2 than a full four-seater.

A new feature was the twin headlights, set into the grille, a design which was to define BMW styling for decades. Early mockups of the E3 featured broad rectangular single headlamps with rounded corners, but these never went into production - perhaps as a result of the lukewarm reception of the similarly designed 2000 CS. The new car also required a new welding plant at BMW&#x27;s Munich site. In spite of the car&#x27;s all-new construction it only cost 70 million D-mark to develop. This was less than half of what one might have expected at the time.

==Nomenclature==
Models were given names denoting their engine sizes, and suffixes to indicate the long-wheelbase (&quot;L&quot;) and fuel injection (&quot;i&quot;) available on later cars. The coupés were all named CS, followed by &quot;i&quot; (for fuel injection models) or &quot;L&quot; (for light-weight models, which also had fuel injection and higher power).

* 2500/2.5, 2.5CS (2494 cc, )
* 2800/2.8, 2800CS (2788 cc, )
* 3.0S, 3.0L, 3.0CS (2985 cc, using twin Zenith 35/40 INAT carburetors)
* 3.0Si, 3.0Li, 3.0CSi (2985 cc, , depending whether Bosch D-Jetronic or L-Jetronic was installed)
* 3.3L, 3.3Li (3295 cc, )
* 3.3Li (3210 cc, , 1976-1977)

== Models ==
The two initial models, introduced in 1968 and sold through 1977, were the 2.5 L 2500 and 2.8 L 2800. The airy, large greenhouse design was roomier than BMW&#x27;s existing range and appeared rather large overall, in spite of being no more than longer than Mercedes&#x27; midrange sedans, which were generally considered to compete in a lower class than the new E3. They were large six-cylinder cars with fully independent suspension and four wheel disc brakes that handled well and impressed contemporary reviewers. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; called the later Bavaria &quot;delightful&quot; and &quot;superb&quot;, concluding that it was &quot;one of the world&#x27;s best buys&quot;. Aside from the larger engine, the 2800 also had bigger tyres and a somewhat sportier suspension, as well as various creature comforts such as a heated rear window, a full tool set, Boge Nivomat self-levelling rear suspension, and a smattering more external chrome.

The dual-carbureted 3-litre 3.0 S was introduced in 1971, being a more powerful and expensive model than the 2800; a fuel-injected version was also made. Also produced were long-wheelbase L models (3.0L, 3.3Li, etc.), whose sharp handling was a stark contrast to the large Mercedes-Benz models of the time. Langley Motors in Thames Ditton UK also produced an estate (tourer) version. Surprisingly, considering their respective marketing profiles, the 3.0 Si sedan was faster than the 3.0 coupé; which was a heavier car by 50 kg, with the same drivetrain.

In the UK, some 3-litre cars were used by the police in the 1970s, with the infamous ad &quot;It takes one to catch one&quot;. Thames Valley Police bought a 3.0 Si in 1972, followed by Derbyshire Constabulary the same year and the West Mercia Police in 1974. The West Mercia Police&#x27;s car was in an unusual livery called &quot;truck yellow&quot;. Following the success of the 3.0 Si, many police forces in the UK began purchasing BMW cars, next one being the 5 Series (E12) in late 1970s.

The body was surprisingly light for its size, weighing less than the smaller E9 coupé. Vision is also good, with narrow pillars and no less than of overall glass area.

At the end of 1973 the new, larger 3.3 L was presented, going on sale in January 1974. It had the longer wheelbase and a bigger engine, although the power was no more than that of the 3.0 Si. Instead, more torque meant to provide a more luxurious rather than BMW&#x27;s usual sporting feel. This engine was updated to fuel injection in June 1975, with a few more horsepower. Subsequent to the introduction of a 3.2 liter version of this engine in the 1976 BMW 633CSi, this slightly smaller model found its way into the 3.3 Li as well. The E3 Sedan was in production from 1968–1978, with a total of circa 190,000 cars produced. Of these, 71,804 were of the US-only &quot;Bavaria&quot; model.

===North America===
In the US market, the 2500 and 2800 were introduced in 1969. The 2500 was shy of many of the luxury features included in the 2800, and with the smaller engine, it sold for about $5,600 in 1970-equal to $ today. The 2800 offered full leather interior, power windows, and power sunroof, which its price of $6,874 ($ today) reflected. For the 1971 model year Max Hoffman, the BMW importer for the USA, convinced BMW AG to build the 2500 configuration car but use the 2800 engine — offering more power without the weight and expense of the 2800&#x27;s luxury features. This new E3 configuration was called the &quot;Bavaria&quot; and was unique to the US market. Priced at about US$6,000 ($ today), the Bavaria came to replace both older models. It is generally considered the forebear of the modern BMW high-performance large luxury sedan as it combined brisk acceleration, sporty handling, plenty of room for four people and a large trunk. An optional three-speed automatic transmission was offered.

For the 1972 model year, the 2500 was dropped while the M30 engine size in the Bavaria was increased to 3.0 liters. The former 2800 was then called the 3.0 S reflecting the 3.0 liter engine. These two models, the 3.0 S and the Bavaria, made up the North American E3 sedan line-up for 1972 through 1974. For the 1974 model year the E3 received the ungainly, federally mandated bumpers front and rear, significantly altering its profile.
In 1975 BMW introduced fuel injection to the US market M30 motor, replacing the twin two-barrel Zenith carburetors used since its inception. The Bavaria was dropped from the line-up, nominally replaced by the fuel-injected M30 powered E12 530i, and the fuel-injected 3.0 Si became the highest end of the BMW model range. The fully optioned 3.0 Si was sold during the 1975 and 1976 model years.

== Coupés (E9) ==

The CS coupé models were based on the standard 2800 sedans, and looked very similar from the front. But they were also related to the earlier 2000CS, as is evident at the rear. The first model was the well-equipped 2800CS of 1968. The 3.0CS models introduced in 1971. In 1974 the smaller engined 2.5CS was made in small numbers, in response to the fuel crisis. The CSL models were lightweight racing versions.

<text>Hayagriva ( IAST , ) is a Hindu deity, the horse-headed avatar of Vishnu. The purpose of this incarnation was to slay a danava also named Hayagriva (A descendant of Kashyapa and Danu), who had the head of a horse and the body of a human.

==Iconography==
Hayagriva is an avatara of the god Vishnu. He is worshipped as the god of knowledge and wisdom, with a human body and a horse&#x27;s head, brilliant white in color, with white garments and seated on a white lotus. Symbolically, the story represents the triumph of pure knowledge, guided by the hand of Divinity, over the demonic forces of passion and darkness.

Vedanta Desika&#x27;s &quot;dhyāna-śloka&quot; (meditative verse) on Hayagriva typifies this deity&#x27;s depiction in Hindu iconography:
He has four hands, with one in the mode of bestowing knowledge; another holds books of wisdom, and the other two hold the Conch and Discus. His beauty, like fresh cut crystal, is an auspicious brilliance that never decays. May this Lord of speech who showers such cooling rays of grace on me be forever manifest in my heart!

In several other sources he is a white horse who pulls the sun into the sky every morning. In others such as the great epic Taraka-battle where the demigods are fallen on and attacked by the Danava&#x27;s [demons], Vishnu appears as a great ferocious warrior called Hayagriva when he comes to their aid. It says: &quot;Hayagriva appears in his chariot, drawn by 1,000 powerful steeds, crushing the enemies of the gods beneath him!&quot; There are many other references to Hayagriva throughout the Mahabharata.

It is said that Vishnu comes from battle as a conqueror in the magnificent mystic form of the great and ferocious Hayagriva:

The great Hayagriva having been praised in this way by the different saints and ascetics, assumes a great white horses head. The verda’s [mantras] made up his shape, his body built of all the great demigods; in the middle of his head was Shiva, in his heart was Brahmā; the rays of sun (Marichi) were his mane, the sun and moon his eyes; the Vasus and Sadhyas were his legs, in all his bones were the demigods. Agni [Ka-ten; god of fire] was his tongue, the goddess Satya his speech, while his knees were formed by the Maruts and Varuna. Having assumed this form, an awesome wonder to behold to the demigods, he vanquished the asura, and cast them down, with eyes that were red with anger.

Invariably, Hayagriva is depicted seated, most often with his right hand either blessing the supplicant or in the &quot;vyākhyā mudrā&quot; pose of teaching. The right hand also usually holds a &quot;akṣa-mālā&quot; (rosary), indicating his identification with meditative knowledge. His left holds a book, indicating his role as a teacher. His face is always serene and peaceful, if not smiling. Unlike his Buddhist counterpart, there is no hint of a fearsome side in the Hindu description of this deity.

Hayagriva is sometimes worshiped in a solitary pose of meditation, as in Thiruvanthipuram Devanathasvami Temple. This form is known as Yoga-Hayagriva. However, he is most commonly worshipped along with his consort Lakshmi and is known as Lakshmi-Hayagriva. Hayagriva in this form is the presiding deity of Mysuru&#x27;s Parakala Matha, a significant Sri Vaishnavism monastic institution.

== Legend ==
According to legend, during the period of creation, two demons Madhu and kaitabha stole the Vedas from Brahma, and Vishnu assumed the Hayagriva form to recover them. Yet another legend has it that during the creation, Vishnu compiled the Vedas in the Hayagriva form.

Hayagriva is listed as one of the ten incarnations of Vishnu in canto 10, chapter 40 of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. In the text, Akrura&#x27;s prayer contains Hayagriva&#x27;s name when he had a vision while bathing in the Yamuna.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; also features the legend of Hayagriva:

== Worship ==
Origins about the worship of Hayagriva have been researched, some of the early evidences dates back to 2,000 BCE, when people worshipped the horse for its speed, strength, intelligence. Hayagriva is one of the prominent deities in Vaikhanasas, Sri Vaishnavism, and the Dvaita Vedanta traditions. His blessings are sought when beginning study of both sacred and secular subjects. Special worship is conducted on the day of the full moon in August (Shravana-Paurnami) (the day of his incarnation) and on Mahanavami, the ninth day of the Navaratri festival.

A verse originally from the Pancaratra Agama, but is now popularly prefixed to the &quot;Hayagriva Stotram&quot; of the 13th-century poet-philosopher Vedanta Desika is popular among devotees of Hayagriva:

Acoording to legend, a Dvaita philosopher named Vadirajatirtha is regarded to have offer cooked horse gram to Hayagriva, and the deity is regarded to have appeared to consume his offerings. Vadirajatirtha would recite the following &quot;shloka&quot;:

Hayagriva is also amongst the deities present at the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam.

==Influence on other cultures==
In the 2015 documentary series, &quot;The Creatures of Philippine Mythology&quot;, the spread of Hinduism and the imagery of Hayagriva is tracked through Southeast Asia. It is speculated that Hayagriva influenced the present imagery of the horse-headed Philippine mythological spirit, the Tikbalang.

An extinct genus of basal neornithischian dinosaur known from Mongolia has been named &quot;Haya griva&quot;. This name refers to the elongate horse-like skull of &quot;Haya&quot; and the appearance of this deity in the Buddhist art of Mongolia.

== Demon Hayagriva ==
The demon Hayagriva was a son of Kashyapa and Danu. He became the first ruler of the Danavas. In Hindu texts, it is stated that when Vishnu had created the Vedas and given them to Brahma, Shiva had decided to wipe out all of humanity except for Manu and his wife, as the rest of humanity was too corrupt to obtain the Vedas. When Hayagariva learnt that humans would be greater than the Danavas, he set out to stop the humans from obtaining the Vedas. Hayagriva visited the Satyaloka when Brahma was absent, and turned into a horse to get the attention of the Vedas (who were in the form of 4 children). He asked them why Brahma has brought them to his realm rather than taking them to humanity. After hearing their tale, Hayagriva laughed and deceived them regarding the intentions of Brahma, stating that the deity wished to keep them for himself. The Vedas were then subsequently imprisoned by the demon. Soon, Vishnu assumed his Matsya avatar and instructed Manu the manner by which he should survive the oncoming flood that Shiva would shortly send to vanquish all evil. Vishnu then slew Hayagriva in his Matsya form and freed the Vedas to bequeath them to Manu after the passage of the flood.
