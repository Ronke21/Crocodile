<text>The Shaftesbury Theatre is a West End theatre, located in Shaftesbury Avenue, in the London Borough of Camden. It opened in 1911 as the New Prince&#x27;s Theatre, with a capacity of 2,500. The current capacity is 1,416. The title &quot;Shaftesbury Theatre&quot; belonged to another theatre lower down the avenue between 1888 and 1941. The Prince&#x27;s adopted the name in 1963.

The theatre, the last to be built in Shaftesbury Avenue, was originally intended to house popular melodramas, but has presented a wide range of productions, including Shakespeare, farce, opera, ballet and revue. Companies based at the theatre for London seasons have included the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, the Ballets Russes, Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera, Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet and the dance companies of Uday Shankar and Pearl Primus. 

The theatre has presented many musicals that premiered on Broadway, from &quot;Funny Face&quot; in the 1920s to &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; in the 1950s, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; and &quot;Hair&quot; in the 1960s, and more recently &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Memphis&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mrs Doubtfire&quot;.

The theatre was at risk of demolition in the early 1970s to make way for new roads or for commercial development, but the Save London&#x27;s Theatres campaign rescued it, and it was given listed building protection in 1974. The actor, playwright and impresario Ray Cooney led a new organisation, The Theatre of Comedy, backed by a substantial group of actors and writers, which leased and then bought the theatre as a home for British comedy. The Theatre of Comedy remains (2023) the owner of the theatre, but the emphasis of programming has shifted from farces and comedies to musicals.

== History ==
===Early years===
The theatre was designed for the brothers Walter and Frederick Melville by Bertie Crewe and opened on 26 December 1911, the last new theatre to open in Shaftesbury Avenue. The site, at the junction of Shaftesbury Avenue and High Holborn, had previously been what the theatre historians Mander and Mitchenson call &quot;a maze of derelict property&quot;. It was originally named the New Prince&#x27;s Theatre, becoming the Prince&#x27;s Theatre in 1914. The original capacity of the auditorium was 2,500. The exterior is faced in terracotta and brick stone with a three-tier façade of vertically aligned windows, topped by a pillared cupola above the entrance. The New Prince&#x27;s was London&#x27;s first entirely steel-framed theatre, with no supporting pillars in the auditorium to obstruct the view. The original colour scheme of the auditorium was cream and gold.

The Brothers Melville, who were already running the Lyceum Theatre, London, intended to continue their policy of staging popular melodramas. Early shows at the New Princes included Carlton Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Apple of Eden&quot; (1912), Arthur Shirley and Ben Landeck&#x27;s &quot;Women and Wine&quot; (1912) and Walter Howard&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;The Story of the Rosary&quot;, (1913), In 1913 the theatre presented a comedy, &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with Frank Cellier as Shylock, but reverted to melodrama with &quot;On His Majesty&#x27;s Service&quot; (1914), &quot;When London Sleeps&quot; (1915) and &quot;For England, Home, and Beauty&quot; (1915), which ran for a hundred performances.

In December 1916 Seymour Hicks took over the management, opening with a revival of &quot;Bluebell in Fairyland&quot; and then reviving &quot;The Catch of the Season&quot; (February 1917), followed by other popular favourites in his repertory. In 1919 C. B. Cochran succeeded Hicks in the management of the theatre, and in April it had a critical and box-office success with André Messager&#x27;s romantic opera &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;, starring Maggie Teyte; it ran for 221 performances. From September of that year the theatre presented a sell-out eighteen-week season of Gilbert and Sullivan operas by the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, returning to the West End for the first time since 1908. During the season the company presented ten Savoy operas including the first revival of the 1884 work &quot;Princess Ida&quot;.

===1920s===
From February 1920 &quot;Pretty Peggy&quot;, a musical, ran for 168 performances. In 1920 the perennial favourite &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; played at the Prince&#x27;s for the Christmas season. In April 1921 Sarah Bernhardt appeared in the title role of Daniel in a play by Louis Verneuil, and Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;Ballets Russes&quot; presented a season including &quot;Petrushka&quot;, &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, and &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, starring Lydia Lopokova.

D&#x27;Oyly Carte returned in October 1921 for a 27-week season during which &quot;Ruddigore&quot; was seen in London for the first time since the original 1887 run. There followed Lucien Guitry, Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps in a season of French plays; a musical called &quot;The Cousin from Nowhere&quot; (1923); &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Eille Norwood; a comedy, &quot;Alf&#x27;s Button&quot;, by W. A. Darlington (1924); and José Collins in a musical play by Franz Lehár (1925).

There were two further successful D&#x27;Oyly Carte seasons in 1924 and 1926; the latter attracted widespread notice for controversial new designs for &quot;The Mikado&quot; by Charles Ricketts. Sybil Thorndike appeared in &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Henry Ainley (1926), and Diaghilev&#x27;s company returned for a season in 1927, with a programme that included the British premiere of Nijinska and Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Les biches&quot; (under the title &quot;The House Party&quot;). In December 1927 George Robey presented his revue &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot;. The following year Fred and Adele Astaire starred in the Gershwins&#x27; musical &quot;Funny Face&quot;, with Leslie Henson. The run was interrupted by a gas explosion in High Holborn not far from the theatre, but after the reopening the show completed a run of 263 performances. The last major production of the 1920s was a farce, &quot;A Warm Corner&quot;, starring W. H. Berry; it ran for 238 performances from December 1929.

===1930s===
In 1930 Berry had another substantial run of 195 performances in another farce, &quot;Oh, Daddy&quot;. For the next few years short runs and revivals predominated at the Prince&#x27;s. In 1933 Charles Macdona revived Victorien Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Diplomacy&quot; with an all-star cast that included Gerald du Maurier, Lewis Casson, Basil Rathbone, Margaret Bannerman and Joyce Kennedy.

During the 1934 season the Prince&#x27;s featured a revival of Edward German and Basil Hood&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Merrie England&quot;, which ran for 187 performances. It was followed by a revival of Sullivan and Hood&#x27;s &quot;The Rose of Persia&quot; the following year – the first professional staging of the piece since the original London run in 1899–1900. It did not achieve the success of the revival of &quot;Merrie England&quot;, closing after 25 performances. In 1935 there was a rare venture into the classics, with a revival of &quot;The Alchemist&quot;. Two of Ian Hay&#x27;s adaptations of Edgar Wallace stories followed: &quot;The Frog&quot; (1936, 483 performances) and &quot;The Gusher&quot; (1937, 137 performances). 

A 1938 success, with 260 performances, was &quot;Wild Oats&quot;, described as &quot;a song and laugh show&quot; with music by Noel Gay and words by Douglas Furber. In March 1939, aiming to attract a new, younger, audience to the theatre, J. B. Priestley arranged to have his comedy &quot;When We Are Married&quot; – which had run successfully at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre at normal West End prices – transferred to the Prince&#x27;s with tickets at half the usual price. &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; (1939) was a comedy starring Sydney Howard. Towards the end of the year, Firth Shephard launched a topical revue, &quot;Shephard&#x27;s Pie&quot;.

===1940s===

Productions during the Second World War included another Shephard revue, &quot;Fun and Games&quot; (August 1941, with a cast including Sydney Howard, Carol Raye and Richard Hearne); &quot;Wild Rose&quot; (August 1942, a revised version of the 1920 musical &quot;Sally&quot;, starring Jessie Matthews); &quot;Old Chelsea&quot; (February 1943, starring Richard Tauber), and &quot;Halfway to Heaven&quot; (December 1943, a comedy starring Howard and Bobby Howes). 

Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre being closed for the duration of the war, its opera and ballet companies toured, and in 1944 based themselves at the Prince&#x27;s for London seasons. The opera season included &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;; the company was led by Joan Cross, and included Peter Pears, Owen Brannigan and Rose Hill. The ballet season presented twelve works, including &quot;Coppélia&quot;, &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Carnaval&quot; and the premiere of &quot;Miracle in the Gorbals&quot;, with choreography by Robert Helpmann and music by Arthur Bliss; the company included Helpmann, Margot Fonteyn, Alexis Rassine and Moira Shearer.

In 1945 Evelyn Laye starred in Oscar Straus&#x27;s operetta &quot;Three Waltzes&quot;, and later in that year &quot;Merrie England&quot; was revived in a radically revised version by Edward Knoblock, with a cast including Heddle Nash and Dennis Noble. In 1946 the theatre staged another Shephard revue, &quot;The Shephard Show&quot;, with Hearne, Arthur Riscoe, Douglas Byng and Marie Burke. In 1947 the Prince&#x27;s came under the direction of Bertram Montague though, according to Mander and Mitchenson, &quot;the new productions were not so successful as the ballet seasons from many parts of the world and the annual pantomimes&quot;.

===1950s===
The next play to achieve a long run was &quot;His Excellency&quot;, a comedy by Dorothy and Campbell Christie, starring Eric Portman and Sebastian Shaw; it opened in May 1950 and ran for 452 performances. In 1951 the theatre presented seasons of dance by Uday Shankar and his Indian Dancers, Pearl Primus and her African Dance company and the Royal Swedish Ballet.

Montague&#x27;s management ended in 1952. The freehold of the theatre remained in the Melville family until 1961; between 1957 and 1961 the theatre was directed by Andrew Melville. 
Mander and Mitchenson record that after Montague&#x27;s withdrawal the theatre was &quot;more often closed than open, though occasional seasons had their successes&quot;. The successes included Maurice Chevalier in a limited season in 1952 (presented by Jack Hylton, who had become the lessee of the Prince&#x27;s) and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; from the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, with Michael Redgrave and Peggy Ashcroft in 1953. Two musicals that premiered on Broadway, &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1954) and &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1955), ran for 245 and 207 performances respectively. &quot;Summer Song&quot;, a musical about and reusing music by  Antonín Dvořák ran from February to June 1965. The D&#x27;Oyly Carte Company returned in 1956 and 1958, for 13-week seasons on each occasion, launching a new production of &quot;Patience&quot; during the first.

===1960s===

D&#x27;Oyly Carte made its last Prince&#x27;s appearances in 1960–61, a nine-week season, presenting ten operas. In the early 1960s the ownership of the theatre changed hands several times. In June 1961, Hylton, who had been the lessee since November 1951, bought the theatre and adjoining property. The following August he sold the freehold to Television Wales and the West, which sold it on to Charles Clore. In September 1962 it was confirmed that a new partnership between Clore and EMI was to control the theatre. At the same time plans for renovating the theatre were announced. For two years the theatre was more often closed than open. &quot;The Stage&quot; said that the theatre had &quot;become rather shabby, possibly because success seemed to elude it for long periods, when it remained dark and neglected&quot;. &quot;King Kong&quot;, a South African musical, ran from February to October 1961, and there were what Mander and Mitchenson describe as &quot;several uneventful productions&quot; until &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; opened in August 1962. It was still running (and moved to another theatre) when the Prince&#x27;s closed for reconstruction in November 1962.

The name &quot;the Prince&#x27;s&quot; was dropped and replaced by &quot;the Shaftesbury&quot;. The new owners felt that the old name was too similar to those of two other West End theatres: there were the Prince of Wales and since 1962 a new Prince Charles theatre. The old Shaftesbury Theatre, further down Shaftesbury Avenue, had closed in 1941, reduced to a ruin during the Blitz, and the owners of the Prince&#x27;s adopted its name for their theatre. The old raked stage was replaced with a horizontal one, and lighting equipment described as &quot;the last word in modernity&quot; was installed; the seating capacity of the renovated auditorium was 1,470.

As the Shaftesbury, the theatre reopened in March 1963 with the American musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; which ran for 520 performances. A musical version of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;, called &quot;Our Man Crichton&quot;, with Kenneth More in the title role, played from December 1964 till June 1965.

The Shaftesbury reopened on 20 November 1965 with &quot;Twang!!&quot;, Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical version of the Robin Hood story. &quot;The Times&quot; later described it as the most expensive flop in West End history to that date. The critic J. C. Trewin described the first night as &quot;a rout&quot; with &quot;some fairly general booing&quot;. The show closed after 43 performances, after which the theatre was closed until October 1966, when success returned with a farce, &quot;Big Bad Mouse&quot;, originally written by Philip King and Falkland Cary, but extensively and successfully ad-libbed through by its stars, Eric Sykes and Jimmy Edwards – &quot;two comedians abounding in their own exuberance&quot; according to Trewin. It ran for 634 performances to April 1968.

Theatre censorship ended in Britain on 26 September 1968, and the following night the musical &quot;Hair&quot; opened at the Shaftesbury. Described as an &quot;American Tribal Love-Rock Musical&quot;, the show contained profanity and scenes of nudity unthinkable until then. It had an exceptionally long run and was just short of its 2,000th performance when part of the theatre ceiling collapsed and the house had to be closed.

===1970s===

In 1973 the theatre was at risk of demolition, faced by proposals by the Greater London Council for a massive road-building programme and by a plan to build an office block on the site. Nearly twenty years earlier a campaign to preserve the St James&#x27;s Theatre from demolition and commercial redevelopment had failed, despite high-profile support led by Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, but in the 1970s the campaign &quot;Save London&#x27;s Theatres&quot; rescued the Shaftesbury (and other theatres). In March 1974 the theatre was protected by being given official grade II listed building status.

After the necessary internal repairs the theatre reopened with a well-received revival of &quot;West Side Story&quot; in December 1974. Other productions in the 1970s included a musical stage version of the BBC television series &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, starring Arthur Lowe, John Le Mesurier and Clive Dunn (October 1975 to February 1976). In September 1978 the theatre presented a revival of Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston&#x27;s 1920s dramatisation of &quot;Dracula&quot;, starring Terence Stamp, with scenic designs by Edward Gorey; it ran for three months.

===1980s===
&quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot; (1980–1982) starring Tom Conti and Gemma Craven was produced by the actor and writer Ray Cooney. After the end of that run and a nine-month closure Cooney presented his farce, &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot; with Richard Briers, Bernard Cribbins and Bill Pertwee. This was the first play under the banner of the Theatre of Comedy, founded by Cooney, who said, &quot;We have the finest comedy talents in the world in this country, both performers and writers, and I could never understand why we could not create our own theatre of comedy&quot;. The Theatre of Comedy became the lessee of the Shaftesbury, and later bought the building. The company was funded by a founding group of well-known actors and authors. The intention was for the Shaftesbury to have a programme of British comedy showcasing existing and new talent.

Substantial runs in the 1980s included Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1984) with Peter O&#x27;Toole, Jackie Smith-Wood and John Thaw; &quot;Two into One&quot;, another Cooney farce, starring Donald Sinden and Michael Williams, and described by &quot;The Stage&quot; as masterly (1984–1986); &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a revue starring Rowan Atkinson (1986), of which the reviewer in &quot;The Stage&quot; wrote, &quot;One leaves the theatre genuinely weak from laughter&quot;; Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; starring Peter Bowles (1986); Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; with an all-star cast in a 645-performance run (1987–1989); and &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins (1989).

===1990s===
Sinden and Williams starred again in a Cooney farce, &quot;Out of Order&quot;, in 1990, which won the Olivier Award for best comedy in 1991. In 1992 the American television executive Donald L. Taffner, a shareholder in the Theatre of Comedy since 1986, became the majority shareholder and chairman of the company. Shows at the Shaftesbury in the 1990s included &quot;Kiss of the Spiderwoman&quot; (1992–93) with Chita Rivera, Brent Carver and Anthony Crivello, and Eddie Izzard in his show &quot;Definite Article&quot; (1995), of which the reviewer in &quot;The Stage&quot; wrote, &quot;you will laugh, laugh again and continue laughing until you feel considerable physical pain. I did.&quot; A revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; ran from September 1993 to March 1994, with choreography by Kenneth MacMillan; the sets, by Bob Crowley, were, in the view of &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;the biggest star in Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s lavish production&quot;.

In 1996–97 the theatre staged &quot;Tommy&quot;, a musical by Pete Townshend and Des McAnuff (1996–97), with Paul Keating in the title role. The production showcased the Shaftesbury&#x27;s advanced technical facilities: &quot;The Stage&quot; called the production &quot;a unique theatrical experience, with scenery that falls faultlessly into place, up, down and sideways ... superb lighting ... wonderfully balanced sound ... and immaculate projection&quot;. The musical itself was less well liked: in his &quot;Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre&quot; (2001) Kurt Gänzl comments, &quot;London gave it the thumbs down in 11 expensive months&quot;. From May 1998 to October 1999 the Shaftesbury was host to the musical &quot;Rent&quot;, which, following a recent fashion for musicals borrowing the plots of Puccini operas, drew on that of &quot;La bohème&quot;; it starred Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Jermaine Heredia and Jesse L. Martin from the original Broadway cast. It was predicted that, reflecting the spirit of the 1990s as &quot;Hair&quot; had that of the 1960s, &quot;Rent&quot; might emulate the long run of the earlier show, and there was some disappointment that it ran for less than 18 months.

===2000s===
A series of short-lived musicals was a feature of the first part of the decade. These included &quot;Lautrec&quot; by Charles Aznavour starring Hannah Waddingham (March to June 2000), &quot;Napoleon&quot; (September 2000 to February 2001), and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; starring Ruthie Henshall (August to October 2001). &quot;Umoja: The Spirit of Togetherness&quot; was well received on opening in November 2001, but noise complaints from the inhabitants of the flats near the theatre resulted in the closure of the show three months later. Further short runs followed for &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (21 October 2003), starring Amanda Holden and Maureen Lipman; &quot;Bat Boy: The Musical&quot; (27 August 2004) by Keythe Farley, Brian Flemming and Laurence O&#x27;Keefe, starring Deven May; and &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; (14 April 2005), starring Kulvinder Ghir; it was described by &quot;The Stage&quot; as &quot;a galumphing great Asian white elephant of a musical&quot;. 

They were followed by &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; (21 September 2006) by Frank Farian, starring Michelle Collins, Javine Hylton and Harvey Junior, and &quot;Fame: The Musical&quot; (4 May 2007) by Jacques Levy and Steve Margoshes, starring Ian Watkins and Natalie Casey of which &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;It really is difficult to find a kind word to say about Karen Bruce&#x27;s production of this shockingly clumsy spin-off&quot;. 

The theatre then had a long run with &quot;Hairspray: The Musical&quot;, which ran from 30 October 2007 to 28 March 2010. It was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman; the original cast starred Michael Ball, Leanne Jones, Mel Smith and Tracie Bennett. Later in the run Brian Conley and then Phill Jupitus succeeded Ball in the lead role.

===2010s===

During the decade the external façades of the theatre were renovated, and the original early-20th-century canopy was uncovered and restored. The auditorium was reconfigured, air conditioning and ventilation updates, and a fly tower with increased technical capability was constructed.

A dance production, &quot;Burn the Floor&quot; (21 July 2010), starring Ali Bastian, was followed by another musical, &quot;Flashdance&quot; (26 September). After that there was a magic show, &quot;Derren Brown – Svengali&quot; (8 June 2011). The theatre returned to musicals with &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (27 September 2011); that was followed by a second run of &quot;Burn the Floor&quot; (6 March 2013), which was succeeded by a new musical by Tim Rice and Stuart Brayson, &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, (30 September 2013).

A revival of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (13 May 2014), which transferred from the Chichester Festival, was notable for being the first West End show to be crowd funded. It was followed by &quot;Memphis&quot;, starring Beverley Knight (22 October 2014); After a short season by a touring &quot;magic spectacular&quot; &quot;The Illusionists – Witness the Impossible&quot; (14 November 2015), , presented the story of the Motown record label founder Berry Gordy (March 2016).

On 20 November 2019 a new musical &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot; opened at the Shaftesbury. The run was interrupted when the COVID-19 pandemic forced West End theatres to close on 16 March 2020.

===2020s===

The theatre reopened on 30 June 2021 with the musical &quot;Be More Chill&quot; (30 June 2021), after which &quot;&amp; Juliet&quot; resumed its interrupted run in September. Another American musical, &quot;Mrs Doubtfire&quot;, opened on 12 May 2023, with music and lyrics by Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick and a book by Karey Kirkpatrick and John O&#x27;Farrell.

<text>Joseph Stillwell Cain Jr. (October 10, 1832 – April 17, 1904) was an American Confederate military veteran largely credited with initiating the modern way of observing Mardi Gras and its celebrations in Mobile, Alabama, following the Civil War.

In 1868, while Mobile was still under Union occupation, Joe Cain paraded through the streets of Mobile, dressed in improvised costume as a fictional &quot;Chickasaw&quot; chief named &quot;Slacabamorinico&quot;. The choice was an attempt to insult to U.S. Army forces in that it was believed by some that the Chickasaw tribe had never been defeated in war.

Joe was joined at some point by six other Confederate veterans, parading in a decorated coal wagon, playing drums and horns, and the group became the &quot;L. C. Minstrel Band&quot;, now commonly referred to as the &quot;Lost Cause Minstrels&quot; of Mobile.

== Life and work ==
Joseph Stillwell Cain, Jr. was born on October 10, 1832, along Dauphin Street in Mobile, Alabama. He married Elizabeth Alabama Rabby. He helped to organize the T.D.S. (Tea Drinker&#x27;s Society), one of Mobile&#x27;s mystic societies, in 1846; however, their banquets were part of Mobile&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations, rather than being held on Mardi Gras day. Other groups had developed Mardi Gras parades, but the Civil War had brought them to a halt.

Cain was in New Orleans in 1867 for the Fireman&#x27;s Day parade. He stayed over until the next day which was Mardi Gras that year, saw the celebration in the streets, and he returned to Mobile determined to revive the spirits of the citizens and to create a similar celebration of Mardi Gras for the people. He conceived the fictional character of Chief Slacabamorinico (&quot;slaka-BAM orin-ah-CO&quot;) while he was the city clerk at the city market.

Dressed in costume with a plaid brad skirt and feathered headdress, Cain paraded through the city streets on a Tuesday in 1868, celebrating the day in front of the citizens of the city and Union Army troops.

A band of fellow Confederate veterans (including Thomas Burke, Rutledge Parham, John Payne, John Bohanan, Barney O&#x27;Rourke, and John Maguire) later accompanied Joe Cain as &quot;Old Slac&quot; riding through town on a decorated coal wagon, playing horns and drums, parading and celebrating. The group became known as the &quot;Lost Cause Minstrels Band&quot; in Mobile.

The first appearance of Joe Cain occurred the afternoon in the same year as the evening parade of the Order of Myths (OOM), the final parade each year.. Joe Cain was one of the founders of the New Year&#x27;s Eve mystic society the T.D.S., and he built a tradition of Mardi Gras parades.

Joe Cain, who had played Old Slac until 1879, died in 1904 and was buried in the fishing village of Bayou La Batre (Alabama). Julian Lee &quot;Judy&quot; Rayford arranged to have Joe Cain reburied in Mobile&#x27;s Church Street Graveyard in 1966, and he established Joe Cain Day in 1967 by walking at the head of a jazz funeral down Government Street to the cemetery.

Joe Cain&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Alabama Rabby Cain, died 3 years later, in 1907 at Bayou La Batre, and she is also re-buried, beside him. Joe and Elizabeth are two of the few, if only, people known to have been buried three times as both bodies were moved after the re-interment in the old Church Street Graveyard the following year to be nearer to his parents&#x27; graves.

==Gravesite==
Joe Cain is buried in the Church Street Graveyard in downtown Mobile, Alabama. His gravestone carries the inscription:
&#x27;

== Joe Cain Day ==
The Sunday before Fat Tuesday, Joe Cain Day is celebrated as part of the scheduled Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, with its center being the Joe Cain Procession (never called a parade). This has been called &quot;The People&#x27;s Parade&quot; because it is performed by citizens without being run by a specific Mardi Gras krewe. Originally, anybody who showed up at the parade start on Sunday morning could join in with whatever makeshift float they could cobble together. Eventually, the sheer size and the city&#x27;s desire to have all the Carnival parades conform to the same set of rules forced the organizers to limit the participants to a preset limit. The parade is preceded with the visit of the &quot;Cain&#x27;s Merry Widows&quot; to the gravesite of their &quot;departed husband&quot; (described below). 

Julian Lee &quot;Judy&quot; Rayford established Joe Cain Day in 1967 by walking at the head of a jazz funeral, along with his beloved dog Rosie (the only dog to ever lead a Mardi Gras parade in Mobile) down Government Street to the Church Street Graveyard, where he had arranged to have Joe Cain and his wife reburied in 1966. When Joe Cain was disinterred from Bayou La Batre, Julian brought Joe Cain&#x27;s skull back to Mobile in the pocket of his coat, and that is considered to be the first &quot;passing of the feathers&quot; to the next person to wear the headdress in Mardi Gras, as &quot;Slacabamorinico, chief of the Chickasaw.&quot;

The feathers were passed in 1970 to Fireman J.B. &quot;Red&quot; Foster who, attired in Plains Indian fashion, led the procession for 16 years. He then passed the feathers, tomahawk and peace pipe to author, historian, public relations, marketing professional and pastor, Bennett Wayne Dean Sr. in 1985. Old Slac IV &quot;hisself&quot; marked his 30th anniversary under the feathers during Joe Cain Day in 2015 noting that he &quot;was just getting started.&quot; The feathers are always passed from &quot;Chief to Chief&quot; and it is his choice only - no other individual or any organization has any say in the selection of a new &quot;Chief Slacabamorinico,&quot; a tradition unique to Mobile and its Mardi Gras.

The impression that the celebration had on a couple of visitors from California resulted in &quot;Joe Cain Days&quot; being officially recognized, in 1993, as a sister celebration by the &quot;Joe Cain Society of California&quot; in Nevada City, California each Mardi Gras.

The Mardi Gras mystic society of &quot;Cain&#x27;s Merry Widows&quot; (a women&#x27;s mystic society) was founded in 1974 in Mobile, Alabama.
Each Mardi Gras, on Joe Cain Day (the Sunday before Fat Tuesday), members of this society dress in funereal black with veils, lay a wreath at Cain&#x27;s burial site in Church Street Graveyard to wail over their &quot;departed husband&#x27;s&quot; grave, then travel to Joe Cain&#x27;s house on Augusta Street to offer a toast and eulogy to their &quot;beloved Joe,&quot; continuously arguing over which widow was his favorite.

<text>The All-American Protectorate, Inc., was a right-wing political group incorporated in February 1963 in St. Louis County, Missouri, under the leadership of general chairman Lovell W. George, and board-of-directors members George R. Kleine and Ernest Conn. The group aimed to provide defense training for its members, and advocated racial segregation and strict immigration controls.

<doc id="1268625" wikidata="Q1137220" url="?curid=1268625" title="OpenGL ES">
<text>OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES or GLES) is a subset of the OpenGL computer graphics rendering application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D computer graphics such as those used by video games, typically hardware-accelerated using a graphics processing unit (GPU). It is designed for embedded systems like smartphones, tablet computers, video game consoles and PDAs. OpenGL ES is the &quot;most widely deployed 3D graphics API in history&quot;.

The API is cross-language and multi-platform. The GLU library and the original GLUT are not available for OpenGL ES, freeglut however, supports it. OpenGL ES is managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group. Vulkan, a next-generation API from Khronos, is made for simpler high performance drivers for mobile and desktop devices.

==Versions==
Several versions of the OpenGL ES specification now exist. OpenGL ES 1.0 is drawn up against the OpenGL 1.3 specification, OpenGL ES 1.1 is defined relative to the OpenGL 1.5 specification and OpenGL ES 2.0 is defined relative to the OpenGL 2.0 specification. This means that, for example, an application written for OpenGL ES 1.0 should be easily portable to the desktop OpenGL 1.3; as the OpenGL ES is a stripped-down version of the API, the reverse may or may not be true, depending on the particular features used.

OpenGL ES comes with its own version of shading language (OpenGL ES SL), which is different from OpenGL SL.

Version 1.0 and 1.1 both have &quot;common&quot; (CM) and &quot;common lite&quot; (CL) profiles, the difference being that the &quot;common lite&quot; profile only supports fixed-point instead of floating point data type support, whereas &quot;common&quot; supports both.

===OpenGL ES 1.0===
OpenGL ES 1.0 was released publicly July 28, 2003. OpenGL ES 1.0 is based on the original OpenGL 1.3 API, with much functionality removed and a little bit added. One significant difference between OpenGL and OpenGL ES is that OpenGL ES removed the need to bracket OpenGL library calls with codice_1 and codice_2. Other significant differences are that the calling semantics for primitive rendering functions were changed in favor of vertex arrays, and fixed-point data types were introduced for vertex coordinates. Attributes were also added to better support the computational abilities of embedded processors, which often lack a floating point unit (FPU). Many other functions and rendering primitives were removed in version 1.0 to produce a lightweight interface, including:

* quad and polygon rendering primitives;
* texgen, line, and polygon stipple;
* polygon mode and antialiased polygon rendering are not supported, although rendering using multisample is still possible (rather than alpha border fragments);
* codice_3 pixel class operations, bitmaps, and 3D textures are not supported;
* several of the more technical drawing modes are eliminated, including frontbuffer and accumulation buffer;
* bitmap operations for copying pixels individually, evaluators, and user selection operations are not allowed;
* display lists and feedback are removed, as are push and pop operations for state attributes;
* and some material parameters were removed, including &quot;back-face&quot; parameters and user-defined clip planes.

The actual version is 1.0.0.2.

===OpenGL ES 1.1===
OpenGL ES 1.1 added features such as mandatory support for multitexture, better multitexture support (including combiners and dot product texture operations), automatic mipmap generation, vertex buffer objects, state queries, user clip planes, and greater control over point rendering.
Actual Version is 1.1.12.

===OpenGL ES 2.0===
OpenGL ES 2.0 was publicly released in March 2007. It is roughly based on OpenGL 2.0, but it eliminates most of the fixed-function rendering pipeline in favor of a programmable one in a move similar to the transition from OpenGL 3.0 to 3.1. Control flow in shaders is generally limited to forward branching and to loops where the maximum number of iterations can easily be determined at compile time. Almost all rendering features of the transform and lighting stage, such as the specification of materials and light parameters formerly specified by the fixed-function API, are replaced by shaders written by the graphics programmer. As a result, OpenGL ES 2.0 is not backward compatible with OpenGL ES 1.1. Some incompatibilities between the desktop version of OpenGL and OpenGL ES 2.0 persisted until OpenGL 4.1, which added the codice_4 extension.
Actual version is 2.0.25.

The Khronos Group has written a document describing the differences between OpenGL ES 2.0 and ordinary OpenGL 2.0.

===OpenGL ES 3.0===
The OpenGL ES 3.0 specification was publicly released in August 2012. It is backwards compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0, and partially compatible with WebGL 2.0, as WebGL 2.0 was designed to have a high degree of interoperability with OpenGL ES 3.0.
The current version of the OpenGL ES 3.0 standard is 3.0.6, released in November 2019.

New functionality in the OpenGL ES 3.0 specification includes:
* multiple enhancements to the rendering pipeline to enable acceleration of advanced visual effects including: occlusion queries, transform feedback, instanced rendering and support for four or more rendering targets;
* high quality ETC2 / EAC texture compression as a standard feature, eliminating the need for a different set of textures for each platform;
* a new version of the GLSL ES shading language with full support for integer and 32-bit floating point operations;
* greatly enhanced texturing functionality including guaranteed support for floating point textures, 3D textures, depth textures, vertex textures, NPOT textures, R/RG textures, immutable textures, 2D array textures, swizzles, LOD and mip level clamps, seamless cube maps and sampler objects;
* an extensive set of required, explicitly sized texture and render-buffer formats, reducing implementation variability and making it much easier to write portable applications.

===OpenGL ES 3.1===
The OpenGL ES 3.1 specification was publicly released in March 2014.
New functionality in OpenGL ES 3.1 includes: 
* Compute shaders
* Independent vertex and fragment shaders
* Indirect draw commands

OpenGL ES 3.1 is backward compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0, thus enabling applications to incrementally incorporate new features. Actual Version is 3.1-(November 2016).

===OpenGL ES 3.2===
The OpenGL ES 3.2 specification was publicly released in August 2015.
New capabilities in OpenGL ES 3.2 include:
* Geometry and tessellation shaders to efficiently process complex scenes on the GPU.
* Floating point render targets for increased flexibility in higher precision compute operations.
* ASTC compression to reduce the memory footprint and bandwidth used to process textures.
* Enhanced blending for sophisticated compositing and handling of multiple color attachments.
* Advanced texture targets such as texture buffers, multisample 2D array and cube map arrays.
* Debug and robustness features for easier code development and secure execution.

Actual State is 3.2.6 July 2019.

Some more extensions are developed or in Development in Mesa for next OpenGL ES Version (see Mesamatrix).

Next generation API is Vulkan.

====Android Extension Pack====
Android Extension Pack (AEP) is a set of OpenGL ES 3.1 extensions, all bundled into a single extension introduced by Google in 2014. This allows applications to use all of the features of the set of extensions, while only testing for the presence of a single one. The AEP was officially added to Android Lollipop to provide extra features like tessellation over what was officially in the GLES 3.1 revision. OpenGL ES 3.2 update is largely made up of the AEP additions, which are already present in desktop OpenGL.

===OpenGL ES 3.2===

OpenGL ES 3.2, incorporating the Android Extension Pack (AEP), &quot;boasts a small number of improvements over last year’s OpenGL ES 3.1. Both make use of similar features from the AEP. From the AEP, OpenGL ES 3.2 compliant hardware will support Tessellation for additional geometry detail, new geometry shaders, ASTC texture compression for a smaller memory bandwidth footprint, floating point render targets for high accuracy compute processes, and new debugging features for developers. These high-end features are already found in the group’s full OpenGL 4 specification.&quot;

Supported by Windows, Linux, Android (since version 6.0 possible, 7.0+ Vulkan 1.0 and OpenGL ES 3.2 needed) on devices with appropriate hardware and drivers, including:
* Adreno 420 and newer (Android, Linux (freedreno))
* AMD GCN-architecture (Windows, Linux (Mesa 18.2 with radeonSI))
* Intel HD Graphics Skylake and higher (Linux)
* Mali-T760 and newer (Android, Linux)
* Nvidia GeForce 400 series (Fermi) and newer (Windows, Linux)

* LLVMpipe: software driver in Mesa 20 (Linux)
* Zink: Vulkan emulation driver in Mesa 21.2 (Linux)

==Deprecation in Apple platforms==
OpenGL ES (and OpenGL) was deprecated in Apple&#x27;s operating systems in favour of its own proprietary Metal graphics API, but still worked in up to at least iOS 12.

==The future==
There is currently no plan for a new core version of OpenGL ES, as adoption of Vulkan has been deemed to displace it in embedded and mobile applications. Development of extensions to OpenGL ES continues as of 2017.
==OpenGL compatibility==

A few libraries have been created to emulate OpenGL calls using GL ES:
* Nvidia offers a 2-clause BSD licensed library called Regal, originally started by Cass Everitt. It was last updated in 2016. Regal is used for example by Google&#x27;s NaCl.
* The MIT licensed GL4ES emulates OpenGL 2.1/1.5 using GL ES 2.0/1.1. It is based on glshim.

==See also==
* Direct3D – Windows API for high-performance 3D graphics, with 3D acceleration hardware support
* DirectX – Windows API for handling tasks related to graphics and video
* Metal – low level, high-performance 3D accelerated graphics library for Apple platforms
* OpenSL ES – API for audio on embedded systems, developed by the Khronos Group
* ANGLE (software) – Google developed library to turn OpenGL ES calls into those of DirectX or Vulkan
* Mobile 3D Graphics API - a graphics API and file format specification for developing Java ME applications

<doc id="1268626" wikidata="Q426135" url="?curid=1268626" title="...Famous Last Words...">
<text>...Famous Last Words... (stylised in all lowercase) is the seventh studio album by English rock band Supertramp, released in October 1982. It was the studio follow-up to 1979&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; and the last album with vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist Roger Hodgson, who left the group to pursue a solo career. Thus, it was the final album to be released by the classic lineup of the band (Hodgson, Davies, Helliwell, Thomson, and Siebenberg).

The album reached number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums Charts in its third week on the chart dated November 27, 1982, and was certified Gold for sales in excess of 500,000 copies there. It also peaked at number6 in the UK where it was certified Gold for 100,000 copies sold.

A remastered CD version of &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot; was released on 30 July 2002 on A&amp;M Records. The remastered CD comes with all the original artwork and the CD art features a green pair of scissors and a black background.

== Background and recording ==
Though Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson had long been writing their songs separately, they had always conceived the theme and overlying direction for each album together. &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot; became the exception to this rule: having been living in different parts of California in the months leading up to the recording, they each conceived their own vision for the album. Hodgson wanted to do another pop album in the vein of &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, while Davies had envisioned a heavy progressive rock album with a 10-minute song called &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; as its centerpiece.

According to Bob Siebenberg, &quot;In the end, they both kind of changed their formats and their picture of what they thought this album should be. It became a diluted version of what it started out to be. It was really neither here nor there.&quot; In particular, the band decided to leave out &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot;, since it was too &quot;heavy&quot; to fit alongside Hodgson&#x27;s pop compositions. Supertramp used &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; for their next album, &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; (1985), though it had by that point evolved from 10 minutes to 16 and a half through the addition of some new sections.

As usual, the songs are all officially credited as being written by Davies/Hodgson. However, the sleeve notes colour-code the songs&#x27; lyrics by individual author. The lead vocalist on each song is the same as its writer: &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Again&quot;, &quot;Know Who You Are&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est le bon&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Now&quot; were written by Hodgson, and &quot;Put on Your Old Brown Shoes&quot;, &quot;Bonnie&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Lady&quot;, and &quot;Waiting So Long&quot; were written by Davies.

The album&#x27;s working title was &quot;Tightrope.&quot; The album was mainly recorded and mixed at Hodgson&#x27;s home, Unicorn Studios in Nevada City, California, as he did not want to leave his wife, his then two-year-old daughter Heidi, and newborn son Andrew behind. Davies wound up recording his vocal and keyboard parts at his home studio, The Backyard Studios, in Encino, California. Other overdubs were at Bill Schnee Recording Studios in Los Angeles.

At the time of the album&#x27;s release, many interpreted the title (which at that point became &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot;) and cover art as thinly-veiled hints that Supertramp was breaking up. In a 2015 interview, Hodgson confirmed that he and Davies decided on the title because &quot;we weren&#x27;t doing [a record] again&quot;. He said that he regrets recording the album, calling it &quot;a last-ditch attempt to try and make things happen&quot; after the life had gone out of the band. Conversely, John Helliwell said in 1986: &quot;We wanted a phrase that bore some relationship with what we were doing but was enigmatic at the same time. We always like to have enigmatic titles like &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;... This last LP we thought was going to be real quick. We thought we were going to rehearse it and record it real quick and it ended up taking longer than any other so we had to eat our words again. For the past three or four LPs we&#x27;ve been saying, &#x27;Let&#x27;s be well prepared.&#x27; So the title sprung out of that as well. I can&#x27;t remember who first thought of it. The graphic design came directly from the title.&quot;

== Reception ==

A contemporary review in &quot;Creem&quot; savaged the album for its nondescript nature, concluding &quot;this stuff is so soddenly bland already that the Muzak folks are going to have their work cut out for them&quot;. AllMusic, in a retrospective review, found the album overly tailored towards commercial success, claiming that the group in general and Roger Hodgson in particular were too fixated on producing more hits, and that as a result &quot;romantically inclined poetry and love song fluff replaces the lyrical keenness that Supertramp had produced in the past, and the instrumental proficiency that they once mastered has vanished.&quot;

After spending years working as an office lady for a Tokyo executive, she enrolled in the and joined the talent agency Mausu Promotion, with whom she was still affiliated at the time of her death.

She was best known for her portrayal of Motoko Kusanagi in the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; film and franchise, and she also voiced Konan in &quot;Naruto&quot;, Caster in &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, Lisa Lisa in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, Chun-Li in &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot;, Claudette in &quot;Queen&#x27;s Blade&quot;, Karura in &quot;Utawarerumono&quot;, Bayonetta in the &quot;Bayonetta&quot; franchise, Hanami in &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen,&quot; and Kyrie Ushiromiya in &quot;Umineko no Naku Koro ni&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Tanaka was born on November 14, 1962, in Maebashi, the capital city of Gunma Prefecture. Her paternal great-uncle was , who was from 1941 until 1943. During her youth, she and her family often saw live Takarazuka Revue performances and went to the local cinema theatre Orion-za, and she became interested in acting after seeing a stage play broadcast on live television. Passionate about acting and dancing, she joined the drama club at and the dance club at , and while studying at Ferris University, she was part of the university&#x27;s drama club and had part-time jobs at Shiki Theatre Company and Shochiku Ofuna Studio, working as a background extra for the latter.

After graduating from Ferris, she took a break from acting and relocated to Tokyo to become an office lady for a private company&#x27;s male executive. After finding it unreasonable to work as an office lady until retirement, she decided to change careers after about six years with her employer, later recalling in a 2022 interview: &quot;Even if it&#x27;s not stable, if I can get a job that I like, it&#x27;s rewarding and I can do it for the rest of my life&quot;. While she continued her dancing career during her office lady career, she decided to end it because &quot;somewhere in my mind [she] felt like [she] had done everything [in dancing she] could&quot;.

After she chose acting over dancing, she became interested in voice acting after meeting a fellow dancer from her native Gunma Prefecture who was also a voice actor, with another inspiration being voice actress . She subsequently joined the in order to study voice acting and get voice acting work, graduating in 1991. After failing to find a talent agency that would hire her, she was eventually invited to join Ezaki Production by manager Mitsue Ono. She then joined the agency&#x27;s training school and, despite her parents&#x27; objections, quit the company she worked at as an office lady after six years after getting enough voice acting work.

===Voice acting career===

After graduating from Tokyo Announcement Academy, she formally joined Ezaki Production (which would later become Mausu Promotion), where she remained until her death. At the encouragement of her Tokyo Announcement Academy teacher, sound director , she took on roles she herself thought were &quot;unsuitable for her&quot;, such as heroine roles. Her first lead role was as Karen Carr in the Japanese dub of the 1992 American film &quot;Unlawful Entry&quot;. Although her parents initially disapproved of her voice acting career, they reconsidered after starring as the guest heroine in the 1993 &quot;Lupin the 3rd&quot; television special &quot;Voyage to Danger&quot;.

In 1995, she started voicing Motoko Kusanagi, the protagonist of the 1995 film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, a role she recalled was the first one &quot;where [she] was rambling on about incomprehensible terms&quot;; she reprised the role in the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; franchise&#x27;s media for 27 years thereafter. Tanaka retrospectively cited this as one of the most memorable roles of her voice acting career. A year before her death, she reprised her role in the second season of &quot;Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045&quot;.

Outside of &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, among her other voice acting roles in anime were Coffee in &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, Margot Langer in &quot;Monster&quot;, Caster in &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, Harumi Kiyama in &quot;A Certain Scientific Railgun&quot;, Konan in &quot;&quot;, Yuri Nikaido in &quot;The World God Only Knows&quot;, Lisa Lisa in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, Reina in &quot;Yakuza Kiwami&quot;, and Hanami in &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot;. Her video game roles included the titular protagonist of &quot;Bayonetta&quot;, Trish in &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, Kainé in &quot;Nier&quot;, Lara Croft in &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, Impa in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot; (2011), Gaby in &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot; (2013), Yennefer in &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot; (2015), and Jerri in &quot;Persona 5 Tactica&quot; (2023), as well as Layla Hassan in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and Chun-Li and Poison in &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. In 2020, she won the Foreign Movie/Drama Award at the 14th Seiyu Awards. She then starred as Mary Sera in &quot;Case Closed&quot;, Flamme in &quot;Frieren&quot;, Rose in &quot;The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic&quot;, and Ōmurasaki no Omae in &quot;Yatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose Its Master&quot;.

Tanaka also worked in foreign works as a Japanese-language dub actress. Among the actresses she dubbed, she had a particularly strong attachment to Nicole Kidman, feeling &quot;a great chemistry&quot; with her and describing herself as &quot;the one person in Japan who understands her acting the best.&quot; Other actresses she dubbed include Kate Beckinsale, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Julia Roberts. She also worked as a narrator.

===Personal life and death===
Tanaka had a son, voice actor Hikaru Tanaka, who did not disclose his familial relationship before announcing her death, and a younger sister. She considered Kikuko Inoue to be her best friend.

Outside of acting, she also had a side career of giving pandas names, including as a godparent of Adventure World&#x27;s giant pandas Yuihin and Saihin, and at point appearing as the anonymous in &#x27;s panda name prediction radio show . She was a fan of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters baseball team, and she and Rika Fukami would often go to the stadiums to attend games.

On August 20, 2024, Tanaka died at the age of 61, one year after being diagnosed with an undisclosed illness. Fellow voice actress and friend Kikuko Inoue had visited Tanaka at the hospital prior to the latter&#x27;s death. Condolences came from many of the people, teams, and works she worked with, including her &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; co-star Jouji Nakata, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; co-star Koichi Yamadera, &quot;Bayonetta&quot; developer PlatinumGames, and the &quot;Frieren&quot; and &quot;Nier&quot; franchises.

A memorial exhibition dedicated to her opened on November 14, 2024 at the Historia Maebashi.

<text>Mansueto &quot;Onyok&quot; Velasco Jr. (born January 10, 1974) is a Filipino retired boxer, comedian and actor from Bago, Negros Occidental. Competing in the 48 kg category he won a gold medal at the 1994 Asian Games and a silver at the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Philippines&#x27; only medal at those Games. He is the younger brother of Roel Velasco, a light-flyweight boxer who won a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

== Olympic results ==
;1996 Summer Olympics results
*Defeated Chih-Hsiu Tsai (Taiwan) RSC 1 (2:27)
*Defeated Yosvani Aguilera (Cuba) PTS 14–5
*Defeated Hamid Berhili (Morocco) PTS 20–10
*Defeated Rafael Lozano (Spain) PTS 22–10
*Lost to Daniel Petrov (Bulgaria) PTS 6–19 (claim silver medal)

==Acting career==
Velasco retired from boxing due to lack of government support and pursued an acting career, stating that he found it more financially sustainable. His life and boxing career was featured in the 1997 film &quot;The Onyok Velasco Story&quot;, where he played himself. This marked his first venture into acting.

Velasco later had a successful career as a comedian, appearing in several sitcoms and comedy films, including &quot;Show Me Da Manny&quot; on GMA 7. He also played the role of a boxing trainer on the TV5 comedy-drama &quot;Beki Boxer&quot;.

==Unfulfilled incentives==
For his feat in the 1996 Summer Olympics, he received pledges of monetary and non-monetary incentives. He was able to receive from then-Manila Mayor Mel Lopez and from the Philippine Sports Commission. However, not all of these pledges materialized as of 2021 including a pledge by the House of Representatives in 1996 and the title for the house and lot he received.

<text>The Metedeconk River is a tributary of Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey in the United States.

The Metedeconk River flows from its North and South Branches to their confluence at Forge Pond, where the river widens (up to just over ) and flows southeast for into Barnegat Bay. It contains both fresh and salt-water portions.

Like many area streets, waterways and towns, &quot;Metedeconk&quot; is the original word or phrase used by the Indigenous Peoples to name themselves or to name themselves after their geography. Its name a direct reference to the Metedeconk Tribes who had two settlements, one on the North Side of the river bordering the Beaver-dam Creek in the region now called CedarCroft, and one on the south side.

==Geographic relation to nearby water features==
At its most eastern face the river meets the Barnegat Peninsula, a populated but narrow strip (less than wide) of New Jersey separating the Metedeconk from a direct connection with the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the river joins the Barnegat Bay to the south and the narrow, man-made Point Pleasant Canal to the north. This canal provides a convenient connection to the Manasquan River, which would otherwise be completely separated from the Metedeconk by about of land. The Manasquan River is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean, as is Barnegat Bay.

==Interactions with ocean waters==
The river is of the floodplain type and is tidal, being indirectly connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Barnegat Bay and the Manasquan River. The Metedeconk&#x27;s main oceanic interactions are through the Manasquan, via the Point Pleasant Canal. In fact, before the canal was opened in 1926, the Metedeconk and the upper part of the Barnegat Bay were mainly fresh water environments and non-tidal. Today, due to ocean tides, the waters of the Bay and the Manasquan are both inlets and outlets of the Metedeconk.

Since the canal, the waters of the lower Metedeconk have been brackish to salty and the ecology of the area has changed considerably. A visual indication of the river&#x27;s connection to the ocean is the cream to brown colored foam that sometimes collects where the Metedeconk&#x27;s waves beat the sandy shores or manmade bulkheads. This foam consists of the microscopic organic material that naturally builds up in the presence of aquatic life; the process of filtering organics from water through wave-like action has been mechanized in most aquariums and is known there as foam fractionating.

As of October 29, 2012, due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy hitting New Jersey, an inlet opened between Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic Ocean at the river&#x27;s east end, the storm having obliterated the dunes, roads, and houses that once blocked off the river from the ocean. Thus the Metedeconk technically opened to the Atlantic Ocean at the base of the Route 528 bridge, whose east end was washed away by the storm, until repairs could be attempted to the peninsula and the bridge. By February 2013, peninsula and bridge repair had effectively reclosed the inlet and reopened the bridge to limited traffic.

==Notable areas==
The river west of Forge Pond (where it forks into North and South Branches) is known as the &quot;upper section&quot;, while the river east of Forge Pond is known as the &quot;lower section&quot;. The upper section is popular with paddle boaters. The lower section, being deeper, wider and wavier, is more popular with sailboats and powerboats.

A notable section of the lower Metedeconk is Windward Beach, a small beach sanctioned for public recreation. On the upper Metedeconk, the river flows through the fresh-water Lake Shenandoah, where a popular county park holds great attraction.

===Metedeconk River Yacht Club===
Metedeconk River Yacht Club was founded by a group of devoted yachtsmen in 1936. The primary purpose for which the club organized was to advance the sport of yachting and to promote the social enjoyment and good fellowship among its members.

==Importance to local communities==
The Metedeconk River is important to local wildlife and the surrounding human populations, providing a place of recreation as it winds through the townships of Brick, Freehold Township, Howell, Jackson, Wall Township, Lakewood and Millstone Township. It is the primary source of drinking water for Brick, Point Pleasant Beach and Point Pleasant Borough. As such, it was classified as a Category 1 (C1) River, the highest level of protection offered rivers by the state of New Jersey.

==Wildlife==
With both fresh-water and tidal wetland portions, the Metedeconk supports an extremely diverse range of wildlife. Wild rice grows along the banks along some portions of the Metedeconk. Bald eagles have been sighted there, and ospreys nest atop nearby trees and industrial towers and come to the river to fish. Sections of the river and surrounding estuary habitat are protected as parts of New Jersey’s extensive Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, because of the river’s great significance to migratory birds and waterfowl.

Mammals of the Metedeconk include those typically found at New Jersey rivers, such as river otters and beavers. Aquatic life includes many species of fish and jellyfish, including one species whose bodies are about two-inches long and appear clear in daylight, but glow blue by night.

==Hurricane Sandy==
In October 2012, under the influence of Hurricane Sandy, ocean waters directly infiltrated the south branch of the river at the area of the Metedeconk Bridge. Immediate impact of the hurricane on the river included a change in salinity of the river&#x27;s ecosystem, as well as elevated contaminate levels caused by relevant water treatment facilities going temporarily off-line. The long-term impact of Hurricane Sandy on the river and its ecosystem remains an area of study.

<doc id="1268647" wikidata="Q990807" url="?curid=1268647" title="Brother Where You Bound">
<text>Brother Where You Bound is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in 1985. It was their first album after original member Roger Hodgson left the band, leaving Rick Davies to handle the songwriting and singing on his own. The album features the group&#x27;s Top 30 hit &quot;Cannonball&quot;.

&quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; reached number 20 on the UK Albums Chart and number 21 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1985, and went Gold according to the band&#x27;s then label A&amp;M Records in 1985, although the RIAA hasn&#x27;t certified it yet.

A remastered CD version of the album was released on 30 July 2002 on A&amp;M Records.

==Songs==
The track &quot;Better Days&quot; features an extended fade-out with voice-overs by the four key players in the 1984 Presidential Campaign: quotes spoken by Geraldine Ferraro and Walter Mondale sounding from the left audio channel and those of George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan on the right, mixed with John Helliwell&#x27;s extended saxophone solo. &quot;Cash Box&quot; called that song &quot;a solidly driving rocker&quot; and praised the production values and melody.

The album&#x27;s sixteen-and-a-half-minute title track featured Thin Lizzy&#x27;s Scott Gorham on rhythm guitar, Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour on the guitar solos, and readings from George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. A demo for the song was recorded prior to Roger Hodgson&#x27;s departure from the band, for potential inclusion on &quot;…Famous Last Words…&quot;, but the band ultimately felt it was too densely progressive rock to be appropriate, and decided against recording it for the album. At the time of the demo, the song was only ten minutes long.

==Release==
To build interest in the release, the album was premiered to dozens of members of the press traveling aboard a specially chartered trip on the Orient Express from Paris to Venice, where reporters were shown the full video for &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot;. The normally low-profile group also did extensive radio and TV appearances, including a high-profile appearance on radio&#x27;s Rockline after a simulcast of the &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; video on MTV and Global Satellite Network.

==Reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review is resoundingly positive, noting that the album&#x27;s thematic exploration of Cold War tensions &quot;is dated and hasn&#x27;t aged very well… but the music is a pleasure.&quot; They particularly praised the &quot;crystalline sound&quot;, the strong performances of the guest musicians, and the complexity of the compositions. They also praised the band for being &quot;gutsy&quot; enough to &quot;re-embrace its progressive-rock roots&quot; while improving their pop songcraft at the same time.

In a review special, Prog Sphere writes &quot;Brother Where You Bound is a prime example of &#x27;crossover&#x27; prog at its very best, and as such highly recommended to anyone but those prog fans who think that &#x27;pop&#x27; is inevitably a bad word.&quot;

<text>Gregorio Hilario del Pilar y Sempio (; ; November 14, 1875 – December 2, 1899) was a Filipino general of the Philippine Revolutionary Army during the Philippine–American War.

As one of the youngest generals in the Revolutionary Army, he was known for the successful assault on the Spanish barracks in the municipality of Paombong, his victory on the first phase Battle of Quingua and his last stand at the Battle of Tirad Pass during the Philippine–American War. Because of his youth, he became known as the &quot;Boy General&quot;. He was also known as a ladies man and was described by National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin as the &quot;Byron of Bulacan&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born on November 14, 1875, to Fernando H. del Pilar and Felipa Sempio of Bulacan, Bulacan, the fifth among six siblings. His siblings were María de la Paz del Pilar (b.1865), Andrea del Pilar (b. 1866), Pablo H. del Pilar (b. 1869), Julian H. del Pilar (b. 1872), and Jacinto H. del Pilar (b. 1878). He was part of the del Pilar family (more properly Hilario del Pilar; Hilario was the original surname before the Claveria naming reforms and was contracted to &quot;H.&quot;) of the &quot;principalia&quot;, whose members included his uncles, lawyer-turned-propagandist Marcelo H. del Pilar, editor-in-chief of &quot;Diariong Tagalog&quot; and &quot;La Solidaridad&quot;, as well as the priest Toribio H. del Pilar, who was exiled in Guam for his alleged involvement in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny. The del Pilar clan was distantly related to the Gatmaitans. Although &quot;principalia&quot;, Gregorio del Pilar&#x27;s branch was relatively poor. It was said that del Pilar had to hawk meat pies as a child to survive.

As a child, he completed his primary education under Maestros Monico Estrella and Romualdo Sempio before being sent to study in Manila. He was enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila at the age of 15, where he was rated good in Latin, Greek, Spanish, and French, middling in philosophy, and excellent in arithmetic and algebra. During his studies in the Ateneo, he stayed in the house of his paternal aunt, Hilaria H. del Pilar, and her husband, the propagandist Deodato Arellano. He helped his uncle distribute revolutionary pamphlets and other materials. There was one incident in Malolos, where del Pilar stole copies of the book &quot;Cuesteones de sumo interes&quot; from the parish priest, Father Felipe García, who had a habit of distributing counter-revolutionary materials after mass. These books were set to be distributed after the mass. Del Pilar removed the book covers and pasted the pamphlets inside before distributing them after.

Del Pilar finished his bachelor of arts in March 1896 and had intended to enroll at the School of Arts and Trades and study to become a &quot;maestro de obras&quot;; however when the Philippine Revolution broke out in August of that year his plans of further study were thwarted. Del Pilar quickly went home to Bulacan and enlisted himself for military service under Colonel Vicente Enríquez.

==Philippine Revolution==
At the onset of the revolution, and in response to reports of &quot;successive triumphs&quot; in Cavite, some 3,000 revolutionary forces marched to seize the town of Paombong, Bulacan, forming a military government. Del Pilar was among those who marched towards Paombong, although there are also rumors of him being present during the Cry of Balintawak.

Del Pilar was eventually assigned to the forces of Eusébio Roque (also known as &quot;Maestrong Sébio&quot;) in &quot;Kakarong de Sili&quot;, a fort near the town of Pandi. On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1897, del Pilar participated in the defense of Kakarong de Sili, managing to escape with only nine others before the Spaniards overran the fort. He recounts in his diary:

His courage and bravery in that action won him recognition and a promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He eventually left Roque&#x27;s unit - Roque was sold out to the Spanish by his own soldiers and executed in February 1897, and del Pilar began to make his way to Imus, Cavite reaching as far as Montalban in February. He eventually returned to Bulacan and joined Adriano Gatmaitán&#x27;s army, being promoted to captain in the process.

As captain, del Pilar managed feats of bravery. He once managed to single-handedly ambush a priest and his escort of &quot;cazadores&quot; from Mambog on their way to Malolos. He shot one of the cazadores which prompted the rest to flee. The event is termed as &quot;pinagtambangan&quot;, according to the marker that can be found on Malolos Bridge.
This act netted him several Mauser rifles and four sacks of coins, which he distributed to his troops. He decreed that married men be given 50 pesos each, unmarried ones 25 pesos, and the remaining money be sent to Manila to buy a blanket and a cloak for each soldier. On September 3, 1897, del Pilar executed an attack on the Spanish garrison in the town of Paombong. He and ten other men slipped into town in the night and fell upon the &quot;cazadores&quot; in the basement of the convent during Sunday mass. Del Pilar himself was stationed in the plaza, firing at the second story of the convent to prevent any men from approaching from the windows. They were eventually able to capture 14 Mauser rifles. Other versions of the raid vary, however. Some tellings talk about how del Pilar and his men slipped into town dressed as women, while other versions have them disguised as &quot;cazadores&quot;. Del Pilar&#x27;s success in Paombong caught the attention of Emilio Aguinaldo, who promoted the captain to a lieutenant colonel, eventually earning his trust and being let into his inner circle of confidants. Artemio Ricarte noted that del Pilar&#x27;s feat in Paombong &quot;exalted him to the horns of the moon&quot;.

Del Pilar celebrated his promotion to lieutenant colonel by creating a distinctive flag for himself and his battalion: a tricolor with a blue triangle at the hoist, red stripe on top and black at the bottom, taking cues from the Cuban flag. He first unfurled this flag during his participation in the Battle of Pasong Balite (modern-day Polo, Bulacan) in 1897.

Due to his closeness to Aguinaldo, del Pilar became one of the signatories of the provisional constitution of the Republic of Biak-na-Bato in November 1897. When negotiations with the Spanish took place in the which concluded with the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, Aguinaldo took del Pilar with him to exile in Hong Kong.

==Second phase and the Philippine–American War==
The exiles in Hong Kong organized a Supreme Council, electing del Pilar to a position second only to Tomás Mascardo. Aguinaldo&#x27;s confidence in del Pilar grew such that he wrote the following about him:

Aguinaldo intended to go to Europe. Traveling under assumed names, he took only del Pilar and Colonel José Leyba with him. The trip ended in Singapore, where Aguinaldo conferred with American consul E. Spencer Pratt, learning of the American declaration of war against Spain. Spurred by this, Aguinaldo and the other exiles decided to return to the Philippines to restart the revolution.
After the Americans defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay, Aguinaldo, del Pilar, and other exiled leaders returned to the Philippines. Aguinaldo named del Pilar Dictator of Bulacan and Nueva Ecija provinces, an honor Aguinaldo would not confer to anybody else.

On del Pilar&#x27;s return to the Philippines, he set out to liberating his home province of Bulacan, eventually accepting Spanish surrender on June 24, 1898. Del Pilar was then called to relieve the wounded General Pantaleon García and continue operations in Caloocan, ultimately succeeded on August 13, 1898. The Revolutionary Congress was then inaugurated on September 15, 1898, and del Pilar became in charge of the military parade. He was promoted to brigadier general after this event.

When the Philippine–American War broke out in February 1899, following the cession of the Philippines by Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris of 1898, del Pilar fought alongside General Antonio Luna in Manila, suffering heavy casualties. Del Pilar&#x27;s relationships with his fellow generals were contentious at best. General José Alejandrino wrote of del Pilar:


Another story between Luna and del Pilar have the two riding together on the front, with Luna so absorbed in what he was saying that he did not notice they were moving into a danger zone. Del Pilar did notice but did not back off because Luna had not. After Manila, del Pilar and his troops moved to Bulacan. Major General Venancio Concepción was placed under his command but the two did not get along. After the fall of Baliuag each blamed the other. Concepción was eventually moved under the command of Luna in Pampanga. Del Pilar, for his part, led his troops to a victory over Major Franklin Bell in the first phase of the Battle of Quingua (modern-day Plaridel, Bulacan) on April 23, 1899. During the battle, his forces repelled a cavalry charge and killed US Colonel John M. Stotsenburg. The Americans were, however, reinforced during the second phase of the Battle and the Filipino forces were forced to retreat. Del Pilar then participated in the Battle of Calumpit alongside General Luna. Luna, however, had left the battle to punish General Tomás Mascardo for insubordination, leaving del Pilar with the defense of the Bagbag River. On Luna&#x27;s return, the Americans had already succeeded in penetrating the Filipino lines and they were forced to retreat.

On June 4, 1899, del Pilar joined Aguinaldo in San Isidro and received orders to capture Antonio Luna, dead or alive, on charges of high treason. It is said that had Luna not come down himself to Cabanatuan and assassinated by the Kawit Battalion from his headquarters in Bayambang that del Pilar would have gone down as Luna&#x27;s killer. Del Pilar and Aguinaldo then descended upon General Concepcion&#x27;s headquarters in Pampanga to relieve him of his position, as he was suspected to be partisan to the assassinated general. Troops surrounded Concepcion&#x27;s headquarters and sentries were replaced by the presidential guards. Concepción was then relieved of his command on suspicions of a conspiracy being plotted against Aguinaldo.

Del Pilar was then tasked with taking possession of Luna&#x27;s old headquarters in Bayambang, and of liquidating Luna&#x27;s former aides-de-camp, Manuel and José Bernal. He arrived in Bayambang on June 7 and managed to capture a younger Bernal brother, Angel, who was arrested and maltreated. Manuel Bernal was captured a few days later, located in the house of the Nable José family. Remedios or Dolores, daughters of the family, was said to be one of del Pilar&#x27;s last loves. Manuel was tortured in the presence of his younger brother Angel by del Pilar and his brother Julian del Pilar for a week before he was killed. José Bernal was captured soon after, taken to Angeles, Pampanga and murdered by soldiers thereafter.

After this, del Pilar was given command in Pangasinan, where he stayed for five months from June to November 1899. He was also posted in Pangasinan to defend against a possible mutiny from Ilocanos outraged with Luna&#x27;s assassination, as well as to defend against the Guardia de Honor, a millenarian cult fashioned after the Katipunan. During this time, the American forces were unusually quiet but the revolutionary government failed to capitalize on this opportunity. Del Pilar himself, was engaged in a number of love affairs. In a letter sent to a relative in Bulacan, he asked for the finest of riding boots, while he ordered the best horses in Dagupan to show off his horsemanship.

By November, Tarlac had fallen to the Americans and Aguinaldo was moving northward towards Bayambang. From Bayambang, the fleeing government led an expedition to Santa Barbara. Del Pilar, at the time, had 2,000 troops: 1,000 in the del Pilar Brigade, 350 in the Joven column, 400 in the Kawit Battalion, 100 in the Corps of Lancers, and two vanguard companies. del Pilar led the expedition northward towards Ilocos. During this time he carried a briefcase containing a girl&#x27;s letter and a lock of hair, from one of his loves in Bulacan.

==Tirad Pass and death==

In November 1899, Aguinaldo&#x27;s party had reached the town of Concepción and climbed the peak of Mount Tirad. Del Pilar ordered three lines of trenches be dug up on the pass and had the &quot;pick of all the men that can be spared&quot; on orders from Aguinaldo. While Aguinaldo and the rest were in Cervantes, Ilocos Sur, del Pilar rode to the rearguard to ensure the safety of the retreat. Word had come that the Americans were advancing on Tirad Pass in an effort to cut off Aguinaldo from the Tinio Brigade situated on the Abra River.

The US Army 33rd Infantry Regiment, under Major Peyton C. March took Concepción on December 1 and began to scale Tirad Pass the next day. Although they had difficulty in attacking the Filipino position, they saw an opening with the aid of a Tingguian Igorot named Januario Galut. The Americans then devised a plan to flank the entrenched defenders from the village of Lingay at the foot of the pass, and from the peak. The combined attack surprised the defenders and the engagement barely lasted six hours. Del Pilar was killed in the skirmish from a shot in the neck, killing him instantly. Of the 60 defenders, only eight remained. After the battle, del Pilar&#x27;s belongings were taken by the Americans as war trophies, including a handkerchief embroidered with the name Dolores, a locket with a picture of a girl, and his diary. His last entry was:

Reports of del Pilar&#x27;s death varied. Two newsmen, John McCutcheon and Richard Henry Little, and a local newspaper called &quot;The Manila Freedom&quot; reported accounts which captured the imaginations of American and Filipino readers. McCutcheon and Little both reported how del Pilar was the last to fall; how he continually urged his men during the battle to fight on, appealing to their sense of love for their native land; how he refused to turn away on his white horse until all the men had retreated; and his death when a sharpshooter got the better of him. &quot;The Manila Freedom&quot; wrote this of del Pilar:

Filipino accounts of del Pilar&#x27;s death corroborate each other and are less glamorous. Del Pilar&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, Vicente Enríquez, writes:

Lieutenant Telesforo Carrasco also recounted:

Del Pilar&#x27;s body lay unburied for days, exposed to the elements. While retracing the trail, an American officer, Lieutenant Dennis P. Quinlan, gave the body a traditional US military burial. Upon del Pilar&#x27;s tombstone, Quinlan inscribed, &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;.

In 1930, del Pilar&#x27;s body was exhumed and was identified by dental records.

==Personal life==

Del Pilar was known for his various relationships during the war. He was reported to have courted almost half a dozen girls, including Neneng Rodrigo, the daughter of Bulacan&#x27;s civil governor, who has his first love; a sister of Colonel José Leyba; a woman named Poleng; and Felicidad Aguinaldo, the sister of Emilio Aguinaldo. It has been asserted that a woman named Remedios Nable José, a daughter of Don Mariano Nable José from Dagupan, was del Pilar&#x27;s last love. It was said that Nable José and del Pilar were almost married, but Nable José rejected del Pilar&#x27;s advances, partly due to his reputation as a playboy. Though Nable José&#x27;s claim is based solely on an interview of her, there still remained a glaring lack of third-party sources to verify her story. Some are still speculating that her sister, Dolores, was the general&#x27;s actual last love as there were numbers of third-party resources name her as the one. First, John McCutcheon, the war correspondent that was with the American troops at Tirad Pass. In an article published by the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, McCutcheon details that Gregorio del Pilar and Dolores Nable José were set to be married around mid-November 1899. However, Aguinaldo&#x27;s order of a hasty retreat in early November caused the wedding to be postponed, and ultimately, to be canceled altogether. He also mentions the handkerchief found on del Pilar&#x27;s body to be embroidered with Dolores&#x27; name, and that a number of the letters retrieved from his person were from her.

There is good reason to believe in the authenticity of McCutcheon&#x27;s account. For one, McCutcheon knew del Pilar previously, having interviewed him multiple times throughout the war. For another, he was with the soldiers that looted del Pilar&#x27;s body, and would have actually seen the spoils himself. He also released more articles that consistently named Dolores, where she could be mentioned. Had he been mistaken, he would have corrected himself in a later article, but the reports did not change. Second, Isaac Cruz Jr.&#x27;s biography of Gregorio del Pilar, &quot;General Gregorio H. Del Pilar: Idol of the Revolution&quot;, includes statements from Tirad Pass survivors that he was able to interview before they passed on.

Lieutenent José Enríquez recounted that Major March showed them some of the del Pilar&#x27;s belongings in his possession, and asked explicitly for Dolores Nable José. Additionally, Captain Isidro Wenceslao mentioned that Dolores was in del Pilar&#x27;s thoughts during his last meeting with Aguinaldo.

Aside from being two of the only survivors from the Tirad Pass, both men were particularly close to del Pilar. Enríquez was the younger brother of Vicente Enríquez and Anacleto Enríquez, who were del Pilar&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; and supporter respectively. The children of both families were neighbors and childhood friends.

Meanwhile, Isidro Wenceslao was part of the famed &quot;Seven Musketeers of Pitpitan&quot;, a group of young men led by del Pilar that initially joined Maestrong Sebio&#x27;s forces at Kakarong de Sili.

If anyone had been privy to the thoughts and feelings of del Pilar, especially in matters so important to him as love, it would be these men. Third, &quot;Nandaragupan: the story of a coastal city and Dagupan Bangus&quot; names Dolores Nable José as the Dagupan belle that del Pilar fell in love with during his stay in Pangasinan. After del Pilar&#x27;s death, Dolores seems to have disappeared from the records, as there is no mention of her in the 1916 court case where her other siblings and father appear.

Despite all this, del Pilar&#x27;s love life still remains a mystery to all historians.

* The final chapter of novel Po-on written by National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose describes del Pilar&#x27;s final evening and the Battle of Tirad Pass from the point of view of Eustaquio Samson, a fictional character. Samson is an Ilocano farmer forced to flee his hometown after suffering abuse from a Spanish friar. Having been the confidante of Apolinario Mabini in Rosales town and now acting as his messenger, Samson is cold-shouldered by del Pilar when Samson tells him he lost Mabini&#x27;s letter; and further suspected of being an enemy spy when Samson claims he was beaten unconscious by the Americans at Candon but somehow woke up alive and abandoned amongst the dead villagers. Samson describes del Pilar as vain, arrogant, and full of youthful folly. He nevertheless joins the Tagalog defenders of the Pass in honor of the &quot;Honorable Cripple&quot; and out of patriotic duty.

<doc id="1268656" wikidata="Q15209345" url="?curid=1268656" title="Terry stop">
<text>A &quot;Terry&quot; stop in the United States allows the police to briefly detain a person based on reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity. Reasonable suspicion is a lower standard than probable cause which is needed for arrest. When police stop and search a pedestrian, this is commonly known as a stop and frisk. When police stop an automobile, this is known as a traffic stop. If the police stop a motor vehicle on minor infringements in order to investigate other suspected criminal activity, this is known as a pretextual stop. Additional rules apply to stops that occur on a bus.

In the United States at the federal level, the Supreme Court has decided many cases that define the intersection between policing and the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, Congress has not defined a baseline for police behavior. There has been some state action at both the legislative and judicial levels, and also some cities have passed laws on these issues.

Some law academics are concerned that jurisprudence permitting &quot;Terry&quot; stops does not account for possible implicit bias of officers, and that this possibly results in racially skewed decision-making. Communities that have high rates of incarceration may experience more intense and punitive policing and surveillance practices even during periods of time when general crime rates are decreasing.

== Origins ==

The concept of a &quot;Terry&quot; stop originated in the 1968 Supreme Court case &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;, in which a police officer detained three Cleveland men on the street behaving suspiciously, as if they were preparing for armed robbery. The police conducted a pat down search and discovered a revolver, and subsequently, two of the men were convicted of carrying a concealed weapon. The men appealed their case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the search in which the revolver was found was illegal under the Fourth Amendment. This brief detention and search were deemed permissible by the court, judging that the officer had reasonable suspicion which could be articulated (not just a hunch) that the person detained may be armed and dangerous. This was not mere &quot;suspicion&quot; but &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; which could be articulated at a later date.

This decision was made during a period of great social unrest in the United States in the 1960s, with rising crime, opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, and race riots. It was thought that law enforcement needed to be provided with tools to deal with the unrest and new issues of urban crime. Some criticized the decision for watering down the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures; others praised it for balancing safety and individual rights.

==Elements==

The United States Supreme Court held that where: a police officer observes unusual conduct by a subject; the subject&#x27;s conduct leads the officer reasonably to conclude that criminal activity may be afoot, and that the subject may be armed and presently dangerous; the officer identifies themselves as a police officer; the officer makes reasonable inquiries; and nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel the officer&#x27;s reasonable fear for safety, the officer may conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of the subject in an attempt to discover weapons, and that such a search is a reasonable search under the Fourteenth Amendment, so that any weapons seized may properly be introduced in evidence.

==Expansion through case law==

===Reasonable suspicion===
To possess reasonable suspicion that would justify a stop, police must have &quot;specific and articulable facts&quot; that indicate that the person to be stopped is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity. Because officers usually do not have supervision when they encounter civilians, they have discretion regarding whom to stop. Reasonable suspicion depends on the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot;. Reasonable suspicion is a vague term, and the Supreme Court concluded that it is to be decided on a case-by-case basis. It often arises from a combination of facts, each of which would, in itself, not be enough justification for the stop.
The suspicion must be that of an individual person. Police officers primarily use situational factors based on criminal behavior to determine whether a stop is needed. In essence, when they witness a person behaving suspiciously or violating the law, they are constitutionally permitted to stop them. Other factors informing the decision include personal attitudes and the decision-making model in effect where the officer works. These subjective influences naturally create the opportunity for bias on the part of police officers who possess animus toward a certain class of people.

The three types of primary sources that courts should accept in order to determine suspiciousness are information obtained from third parties, information based on the suspect&#x27;s appearance and behavior and the time and place of the suspected offense. Officers can define what they believe is normal, and if and how the suspect deviates from this. Reasonable suspicion has been used for actions such as standing in the wrong place, nervousness, exceptional calmness or walking quickly in another direction. Officers&#x27; experiences may make them suspicious of behavior that is usually innocuous. For instance, a social interaction such as a hug or a handshake might be perceived as a drug deal. Merely identifying that a person belongs to a broad category, such as physical location, race, ethnicity or profile, is insufficient for reasonable suspicion. However, stop-and-frisk has been validated on the basis of furtive movements, inappropriate attire, carrying objects such as a television or a pillowcase (in English law, &quot;going equipped&quot;), vague, nonspecific answers to routine questions, refusal to identify oneself and appearing to be out of place.

Before 1968, the law required substantial evidence to impede liberty or seize property. However, the Fourth Amendment does not protect consensual encounters. In its &quot;Terry&quot; decision, the Supreme Court found that the police should have the power to search, even without probable cause, to protect themselves from weapons. The &quot;Terry&quot; stop operates under the assumption that although stop-and-frisk is an intrusion, the potential harm from weapons outweighs it.

The cases following &quot;Terry&quot; expanded the power of the police. While the original case was concerned with armed violence and firsthand observation by officers, &quot;Adams v. Williams&quot; (1972) extended the doctrine to drug possession substantiated by the secondhand hearsay of an informant. The &quot;Adams v. Williams&quot; case set a precedent that police are not required to directly observe suspicious behavior if their reasonable suspicion is based upon information provided by a confidential informant. Regarding the case, Justice Marshall stated: &quot;Today&#x27;s decision invokes the specter of a society in which innocent citizens may be stopped, searched, and arrested at the whim of police officers who have only the slightest suspicion of improper conduct.&quot; &quot;United States v. Hensley&quot; (1985) ruled that police officers may stop and question suspects whom they recognize from &quot;wanted&quot; flyers issued by other police departments. In &quot;Illinois v. Wardlow&quot; (2000), a person&#x27;s unprovoked flight from Chicago police officers in &quot;an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking&quot; constituted reasonable suspicion to stop him.

During &quot;Terry&quot; stops, police usually ask detainees to identify themselves. Several states require people to provide their names to the police upon request. In &quot;Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada&quot; (2004), these stop-and-identify statutes were deemed constitutional. While the specifics of stop-and-identify statutes and ordinances vary, a significant number of states and local jurisdictions have enacted such laws. In New York, courts have limited the effects of &quot;Terry&quot; by creating a four-level continuum of intrusion, each of which requires its own level of suspicion. This allows police officers to detain people if the officers possess an articulable and objectively credible reason. In &quot;People v. DeBour&quot;, New York&#x27;s highest court permitted the police to stop a person who simply crosses the street upon observing the police.

Lacking reasonable suspicion, police may stop a person based on a hunch, constituting a consensual stop. &quot;United States v. Mendenhall&quot; found that police are not generally required to advise an individual that the stop is on a consensual basis nor that the person may leave at any time. A person can typically determine whether a stop is consensual by asking, &quot;Am I free to go?&quot;. If the officer responds in the negative or does not respond, the person is being detained under a &quot;Terry&quot; stop; otherwise, the person may leave. &quot;Mendenhall&quot; also found that a consensual stop can be converted into an unconstitutional &quot;Terry&quot; stop by circumstances such as &quot;the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer&#x27;s request might be compelled.&quot; Police who conduct an unconstitutional &quot;Terry&quot; stop can face administrative discipline and civil suits.

In &quot;Pennsylvania v. Mimms&quot;, two police officers issued Mimms a ticket for driving a car with an expired license plate. When they asked him to step out, they realized that he had a gun, and promptly arrested him. The court ruled in favor of the police, citing officer safety as their reason. Dissenting justices found that this furthers the expansion of &quot;Terry&quot;. They feared that the ruling set a precedent that officers could ask citizens to perform actions through warrantless intrusion.

===Search===

A frisk, also known as a pat-down, of the surface of a suspect&#x27;s garments is permitted during a &quot;Terry&quot; stop but must be limited to actions necessary to discover weapons and must be based on a reasonable suspicion the individual may be armed. However, pursuant to the plain-feel doctrine (similar to the plain-view doctrine), police may seize contraband discovered in the course of a frisk, but only if the type of contraband is immediately apparent.

The Supreme Court has placed very liberal requirements on what is &quot;immediately apparent&quot; regarding contraband. In an example provided by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, an officer feels a hard pack of cigarettes while frisking a suspect and inspects the pack, discovering drugs inside. The officer is legally permitted to open the pack because he has prior knowledge, based on experience, that a small switchblade or tiny gun could be hidden in such a box.

Subsequent court cases have expanded the definition of what constitutes a frisk and what is considered as admissible evidence. In &quot;Michigan v. Long&quot;, &quot;Terry&quot; stops were extended to searching the inside of a car passenger compartment if police have reasonable suspicion that an occupant may have access to a weapon there. In &quot;Minnesota v. Dickerson&quot;, the court ruled that &quot;immediately recognized&quot; contraband discovered during a &quot;Terry&quot; stop is also a lawful seizure.

==== Consensual search ====
Based on the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Schneckloth v. Bustamonte&quot; (1972), a person waives Fourth Amendment protections when voluntarily consenting to a search. Police are not required to inform a person of his or her right to decline the search. Justice Marshall, in his dissent, wrote that it is a &quot;curious result that one can choose to relinquish a constitutional right—the right to be free from unreasonable searches—without knowing that he has the alternative of refusing to accede to a police request.&quot; Several cities and states require police to inform citizens of their right to deny a search.

== Traffic stops ==

For practical purposes, a traffic stop is essentially the same as a &quot;Terry&quot; stop; for the duration of a stop, driver and passengers are &quot;seized&quot; within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that drivers and passengers may be ordered to exit the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures. Drivers and passengers may be frisked for weapons upon reasonable suspicion they are armed and dangerous. If police reasonably suspect the driver or any of the occupants may be dangerous and that the vehicle may contain a weapon to which an occupant may gain access, police may perform a protective search of the passenger compartment. Otherwise, lacking a warrant or the driver&#x27;s consent, police may not search the vehicle, but under the plain-view doctrine may seize and use as evidence weapons or contraband that are visible from outside the vehicle.

As decided in &quot;Ohio v. Robinette&quot; (1996), after an officer returns the driver&#x27;s identification, there is no requirement that the officer inform the driver of his or her freedom to leave; therefore, although the encounter has changed to a consensual encounter, questioning can continue, including a request to search the vehicle.

==Pretextual stops==
Pretextual stops are a subset of traffic stops deemed constitutional by the Supreme Court in &quot;Whren v. United States&quot; (1996). They occur when a police officer wishes to investigate a motorist on other suspicions, generally related to drug possession, and uses a minor traffic infringement as a pretext to stop the driver. In the case of &quot;Whren&quot;, the defense used a &quot;would-have&quot; rule, asking whether a reasonable police officer would have made the stop without the suspicion of other criminal behavior. Some consider that pretextual stops can allow racial profiling to occur. There are numerous petty violations that a typical driver might commit, and the officer can be selective about whom to detain for questioning. Sixteen states ban pretextual stops based solely upon racial profiling or other factors:

== Racial disparities ==
Police officers may develop schemas after continuously being exposed to certain environments, like high-crime minority neighborhoods, which can lead to their association of crime with race instead of focusing on suspicious behavior. Officers who have been in the police force for longer are more likely to have suspicions based on non-behavioral reasons. Forms of American culture that perpetuate negative stereotypes, such as black people being violent or white people committing white-collar crimes, can theoretically cause people to act on these stereotypes, even if they do not believe them, making implicit bias a possible factor in arrests. Some argue that Black and Hispanic people are more likely to be targeted and are more likely to be stopped than population and relative crime rates might suggest.

&quot;Terry&quot; stop regulations vary by area. Areas with high crime, such as public housing, might require less evidence for someone to be stopped. This places the inhabitants of the area at greater risk for detainment. In areas that are perceived to have high crimes, more police are deployed, which results in higher arrest rates, which are then used to justify more policing. When controlling for location-based stops, one study found that white people were more likely to have a weapon than are black or Hispanic people. Another study determined that the same proportion of racial groups were stopped during the day and at night, suggesting that stop decisions were not based on the physical appearance of the driver. However, the study was interpreted to suggest that black people are more likely to be detained for longer periods of time. The National Research Council states that &quot;more research is needed on the complex interplay of race, ethnicity, and other social factors in police-citizen interactions.&quot;

One study suggested a 27% increase in the likelihood of black people experiencing force during a stop compared to a white person, and a 28% increase in likelihood that the officer would draw his or her gun. The study also determined that even during consensual stops, blacks are 29% more likely to experience force than other racial groups. Young people were found more likely to experience force compared to older people. In New York City between 1996 and 2000, there was a disproportionate number of complaints by blacks about officers&#x27; use of force. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations investigations have confirmed that police-perpetrated abuse has affected many people of all races. Another study blamed variances in types of nonverbal communication among races as a factor influencing some officers&#x27; suspicions.

A 2009 study theorized that police officers could use their power to enforce their masculinity. Because most police officers and detainees are men, officers are susceptible to the culture of honor stance and hypermasculinity, in which they are more prone to physical aggression in order to protect their social standing.

A 2015 study concluded that immigration does not have a positive correlation with crime, but that immigrants are disproportionately stopped and arrested, leading to distrust of law enforcement. The study also argued that immigrants typically possess less awareness of how to behave when stopped by the police. After being stopped more often, immigrants may hold distrust towards the police.

== Effects ==

=== Usage of force ===
The experience of minority citizens, who are both more likely to be stopped by police and more likely to experience the use of force by the police after being stopped, has been characterized as a racial or ethnic &quot;double jeopardy&quot;. Acts of police force cause injury, death, civil litigation, public outrage, civil disorder, and a distrust towards the police.

Eric Garner and NYPD, Freddie Gray and the Baltimore police, and Michael Brown and the Ferguson police are notable examples of police force at &quot;Terry&quot; stops that ended tragically. Although racial disparities in the frequency of &quot;Terry&quot; stops are well known, less is known about the nature, prevalence, and factors predictive of use of force during &quot;Terry&quot; stops.

Morrow et al. studied NYPD&#x27;s SQF (stop, question, and frisk) records in 2010 to determine the frequency of force used at stops and whether the citizen&#x27;s race/ethnicity was a factor in the decision to use force. SQF tactics were found to disproportionately target minorities, regardless of control over variables like social and economic factors, precinct crime rates, and neighborhood racial or ethnic composition. SQF tactics did not seem to actually address crime either, as only 6% of stops yielded an arrest and only 0.15% of stops yielded a gun. In 2013, 44% of young minority New Yorkers had been stopped by NYPD nine or more times.

Using the US Census Bureau&#x27;s data from 2012, Morrow et al. analyzed racial/ethnic disparities in the use of force among NYPD. Force was classified as hands, suspect on ground, suspect against wall, weapon drawn, weapon pointed, baton, handcuffs, pepper spray, and other; these were then categorized as no force, physical/non-weapon force, and weapon force. They found that non-weapon force occurred in 14.1% of SQF. However, when this was further separated by racial categories, while for whites, only 0.9% experienced non-weapon force, 7.6% blacks and 5.0% Hispanics experienced non-weapon force, eight to nine times more likely than whites. There is a possibility that these results are due to implicit biases of police officers, which could be shaped by previous experiences in the workforce.

=== Psychological and emotional harm ===
A stop and frisk can be damaging to communities. Kwate and Threadcraft argue that stop and frisk is a public health problem and works to &quot;produce bodies that are harassed, stressed and resource deprived, if not altogether dead&quot;. Stop and frisk creates an environment of fear that alters the behaviors of a community&#x27;s inhabitants and limits their freedom of action. The police conduct pat-downs that intrude upon the privacy of the individual, and can result in escalation through physical or sexual violence. During this process, officers sometimes use profanity and discriminatory slurs. Because of this, residents often have anger, fear, or distrust towards the police.

For those with mental disorders and disabilities, pat-downs can be traumatic, especially for those with sensory disorders. Those who have suffered through sexual trauma, which is prevalent among men with criminal justice histories and black people in poorer urban areas, can relive their trauma through the invasive procedure, resulting in stress, depression, and anxiety. This practice also increases the possibility of sexual exploitation or assault, especially in communities that are more vulnerable, like black and poor sex workers and sex trafficking victims. Because ways of transporting drugs have evolved, some police officers utilize methods such as stripping the civilian and searching their body for drugs, which can be traumatizing for both users and nonusers of drugs. Civilians have also reported that police officers often wait until their quota is filled up to bring the arrested civilians back to stations. Civilians must stay in the back of the van, which often was missing seats, for hours on end and packed with 15 or 16 people, without access to the bathroom.

In a study conducted by Cooper et al., young men who do not use drugs stated that they feel uncomfortable when stopped by a police officer because they were afraid that &quot;unnecessary violence or life disruption was imminent during every police stop&quot;. Those who have been stopped more often develop more allostatic load, resulting in low self esteem and despair. When residents of a community know they are being treated both unfairly, and unfairly due to their social identity, they are more likely to anticipate stigma and rejection due to their race. Marginalized communities that experience recurring injustice from the police distrust them and become more cynical of them, resulting in legal cynicism, which in turn results in decreased cooperation and respect toward the legal system. This loss of faith in the system causes depressed civic and political engagement. Community residents are less likely to call for the police to help when they believe the police are not on their side, instead turning towards other community members. This distrust towards police is passed down from generation to generation, otherwise known as legal socialization, as a means of protection, forcing the community to live in perpetual fear.

Items that are discovered during pat-downs that are incriminating, like clean needles, condoms, and other harm reduction tools, are used less to prevent arrest; this then is a danger to public health.

== Solutions ==
Many police departments all over the country have adapted courtesy policing as a response to criticism of racial profiling and police violence. Courtesy policing is when the police build rapport with the community through respect and friendliness. Legitimacy policing is a method used by police officers to interact with the community, where, in order to achieve a desired outcome, police officers utilize both punitive and courtesy strategies. While courtesy policing is used to gain trust and collect information, the punitive approach is used whenever it appears that the stopped people did not comply, making the police more aggressive; these approaches are adapted on a shifting continuum to the actions of the people they stop. People of color are more likely to see this community policing as degrading.

Cooper believes that in order to address hypermasculinity, which increases physical aggression in the police force, officers should be taught to not use command presence (where they use an authoritative tone of voice or even become physically violent) in situations where it is not needed. It should still be used when the officer is in a dangerous situation, but not when a situation does not require force. Instead of the officer punishing the harm doer, the officer should instead make it a goal to have a full understanding of the situation. Police training culture should not emphasize aggressive approaches and instead advocate for a more patient approach. An emphasis should be put on how to communicate with civilians who challenge their authority. Officers should also be made aware of any potential biases they may have.

Terry was originally created to prevent imminent armed robberies. However, 90% of individuals who are stop-and-frisked in New York City were free to leave afterwards. This demonstrates that they were not about to do serious criminal activity, which goes against Terry’s purpose of preventing serious crime. Hutchins wishes to narrow the scope of Terry, and prevent certain police encounters from happening in the first place, and proposes to limit the reach of &quot;Terry&quot; stops so that officers may not stop someone based on a possessory offense under nothing more than reasonable suspicion. Goel calls for the optimization of stop relating to criminal possession of a weapon (CPW). Because having a lower threshold of evidence to stop someone disproportionately affects black and Hispanic people, optimization would result in less racial disparities for &quot;Terry&quot; stops. Goel examines NYPD’s three million stops for cases where the stop yielded an individual involved with criminal possession of a weapon. In approximately 43% of these stops, there was less than 1% of a chance that the suspect had a weapon. Goel found that five stop circumstances are more likely to increase the likelihood of recovering a weapon for a stop: suspicious weapon, sights and sounds of criminal activity, suspicious bulge, witness report, and ongoing investigation.

Kwate and Threadcraft advocate for three ways to address Stop and Frisk, as a public health issue. First, they believe the health department’s citywide health surveys should include Stop and Frisk encounters, so that the data can be used to investigate health outcomes of a Stop and Frisk. Second, within 24 hours, reports of traumatic stops should be received by the city. Third, a registry should be created in which communities can report police encounters. Torres calls for more comprehensive data in stop and frisk reports. Specifically, since Latinos can also be white and black, current data is not as accurate.

==Data collection==
The following states require stop-and-frisk data collection:

Using public record requests, the Stanford Open Policing project amassed 60 million state traffic stops in 20 states over the period 2011 through 2015.

North Carolina was the first state in the country to require the release of all traffic stop data starting in 2000. Researchers have analysed 20 million traffic stops from this data finding that African Americans as a share of the population were twice as likely to be pulled over than whites and four times as likely to be searched. Hispanics were not more likely to be pulled over, but had a higher likelihood of being searched.

There is a push to release more open police data nationwide. In 2015, the White House launched the Police Data Initiative which, , has 130 participating police departments, some of which provide data sets on stop-and-frisk. The 130 departments cover 15% of the population.

Maldives was placed in the group B with India and Bangladesh, where they advanced into the semi-final as the group&#x27;s second team with two points in hand. They drew their first match against Bangladesh with the help of Lirugham Saeed&#x27;s only goal. In the second match, they drew against the India 2–2, in which Ibrahim Rasheed and Mohamed Nizam came scoring when the Red Snappers were at a two-goal deposit.

====2018 SAFF Suzuki Cup winners====

==== 2023 SAFF Championship ====
Maldives left the tournament from group stage with a win and two losses.

<doc id="1268660" wikidata="Q5137061" url="?curid=1268660" title="Clyde X">
<text>Clyde X (1931 – February 14, 2009), also known as Clyde Rahman, was a religious leader associated with the Nation of Islam. Most of his work for the NOI was in St. Louis, Missouri and Cleveland, Ohio. He was wounded when a violent factional dispute arose in St. Louis in the 1960s. In the 1970s he became a follower of W. D. Muhammad&#x27;s Sunni faction of the NOI and established a mosque in Cleveland.

==Early life==
He was born Clyde Jones in Canton, Mississippi. He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. After his service, he moved to Dayton, Ohio, and then to Detroit where he worked as a machinist.

He served in the army during the Korean War, in which he was badly wounded. He joked that he was cured when a nurse denied him morphine, and he jumped out of bed to chase her. He subsequently joined the police force in Detroit.

==NOI activist==
While in Detroit, Clyde was first introduced to the Nation of Islam (NOI) through &quot;people talking about it in a poolroom.&quot; He became &quot;Clyde X&quot;. In 1958 he was sent to St. Louis in the service of the NOI to establish Temple No. 28 at 1434 N. Grand Avenue.

When he arrived in St. Louis the local media described him as &quot;a glowering moon-faced giant... on the fleshy side of 200 pounds... mild mannered, polite, and diplomatic.&quot; They also described him as &quot;too emotional,&quot; a &quot;rabble rouser,&quot; and &quot;a haranguer.&quot;

Clyde X helped to launch many business ventures with Temple No. 28, opening a restaurant called the &quot;Shabbaz&quot;; laundry; record store; dress shop; and a grocery along Grand Avenue, leading some in the community to call the area &quot;Little Egypt.&quot;

==Violent splits==
In 1961, Clyde X&#x27;s Temple No. 28 saw an internal split, with members leaving to join the offshoot &quot;Islamic Service Church&quot; headquartered at 1902 Union Boulevard. Elijah Muhammad, displeased with the split, sent the Supreme Commander of the Fruit of Islam to try to broker a reconciliation. No such agreement could be reached, and the two temples were officially separated.

The split resulted in sporadic incidents of violence, with Clyde X, Timothy Hoffman, and John Moore being shot outside the Shabazz restaurant in 1966. The principal suspect was Hoffman&#x27;s brother Andrew, who was subsequently arrested. While Clyde and Hoffman were not seriously hurt, Moore died as a result of his wounds. Nevertheless, Clyde had a bullet lodged in his skull for the rest of his life. One year later, on January 9, 1967, Clyde X&#x27;s home was bombed, but he was unhurt. Andrew Hoffman was again suspected. Two days after this Andrew Hoffman and his wife were both shot to death outside their home. An associate of his, Roy Tyson, was found beaten to death. No charges were ever brought in the deaths.

==Later career==
In the mid-1970s, after the death of Elijah Muhammad, Clyde X supported the reforms of Warith Deen Mohammed&#x27;s faction, which sought to align the NOI with mainstream Sunni Islam. He became a leader in W.D. Mohammed&#x27;s new organization, the American Society of Muslims. He moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he worked with Cleveland&#x27;s Muslim community using the name Imam Clyde Rahman. Rahman became W.D. Muhammad&#x27;s principal representative in Cleveland, building the Masjid Bilal mosque there in 1983. He adopted an ecumenical approach saying &quot;Our Koran does not even hint that we should take innocent life, and it is a disgrace to Islam for any Muslim to support terrorism.&quot;

He served on the board of a number of local civic groups. In his last years he suffered from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on February 14, 2009, at age 79, at Park East Care and Rehabilitation Center, Beachwood.

==Family==
Rahman married twice. His first wife, Beatrice, died young. The couple had no children. Rahman came to believe he may be infertile. However, he remarried in 1990 to Hameeda, with whom he had three daughters, Daa&#x27;iyah Rahman, Jameelah Rahman, and step-daughter Siddeeqah Abdullah.

<text>&quot;The Bird&quot; is a song from the Time&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ice Cream Castle&quot;. The song was initially recorded in the studio in 1983 with all instruments by Prince, except guitar, which was performed by Jesse Johnson. 
This version was replaced by a live recording with the full band at the First Avenue on October 4, 1983. This is the first Time song to be released featuring the Time as a band, rather than primarily Prince with Morris Day on vocals.

Two more live versions have been released: one on Prince&#x27;s &quot;Rave Un2 the Year 2000&quot; DVD, and one recorded at the House of Blues in 1998 for Morris Day&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;.

==Background==
The song suggests that by dancing &quot;the bird&quot;, one can overcome their troubles. &quot;The Bird&quot; uses both a drum machine and live drumming by Jellybean Johnson. A &quot;Dance Remix&quot; of the song was released as a 12&quot; single. The B-side to the single was the rocker, &quot;My Drawers&quot;.

==Reception==
John Leland of &quot;Spin&quot; said the song, &quot;comes close enough to capturing the band&#x27;s leopard-skin razzle-dazzle to give the overextended Kid a run for his considerable money. The best song from &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is the best slice of black rock on the market.&quot;

<text>Free as a Bird is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in October 1987, and their last album of new music for A&amp;M Records.

The album was a turn of direction of sorts, with most of the songs stepping back from their progressive rock sound, employing synthesised dance beats and rhythms. Chief songwriter Rick Davies later recalled, &quot;&quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was an experiment to try and be modern and build it up with computers and drum machines and have people come in one by one, which makes you lose the band spirit a little bit.&quot; In the liner notes to the 2005 compilation &quot;Retrospectacle&quot;, Davies said, &quot;Each time we went in, we would try to give it something a bit different. &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was a lot more machine-based than anything we&#x27;d done before. That was good and bad, but it had some interesting songs on it.&quot;

== Overview ==
&quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was the first Supertramp album to feature contributions from guitarist/vocalist Mark Hart. He would later become a full-fledged member of the group, as would trumpet player Lee Thornburg.

Despite the fact that &quot;I&#x27;m Beggin&#x27; You&quot; was a club chart-topping hit and &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;&#x27;s title cut was a minor hit, the album did not do well peaking at No. 101, making it the first Supertramp album since 1971&#x27;s &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot; not to crack Billboard&#x27;s Top 100 on the album charts.

The band disbanded after the tour in support of the album and would not reconvene until 1997. They did so without bassist Dougie Thomson.

A remastered CD version of the album was released on 30 July 2002 on A&amp;M Records. The remastered CD comes with all of the original album artwork, lyrics and credits.

==Artwork==
Originally, the vinyl album featured four color variants – blue (pictured), green, yellow and pink. The bird in the picture was a cut-out.

The cover depicts a photograph of Georges Braque in his studio, painting a stylized bird. The bird silhouette also appeared on the LP and CD label.

==Reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine brief retrospective review dismissed &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; as &quot;a colorless and tuneless collection of prog rock meandering&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Rick Davies except where noted.

<doc id="1268687" wikidata="Q1155369" url="?curid=1268687" title="Hundred Islands National Park">
<text>The Hundred Islands National Park is the first Philippine national park and a protected area located in Alaminos, Pangasinan. The islands, totaling 124 at low tide and 123 at high tide, are scattered in Lingayen Gulf covering an area of . Only four of them had been developed for tourism: Quezon Island (the most developed), Governor Island, Children&#x27;s Island, and Pilgrimage Island.

==Geology==

The islands are of karst or limestone landscape. The islands are believed to be about two million years old. There are actually ancient corals that extend well inland, in an area previously comprising the seabed of an ancient sea. The lowering of the sea level have exposed them to the surface. The peculiar &quot;mushroom-like&quot; shapes of some of the islands were caused by the eroding action of ocean waves.

==History==
The national park was created by Presidential Proclamation No. 667, covering an area of and signed by President Manuel L. Quezon on January 18, 1940, for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the Philippines and known as the &quot;Hundred Islands National Park&quot; (HINP). The Republic Act No. 3655 signed on June 22, 1962, created the Hundred Islands Conservation and Development Authority (HICDA), for the conservation, development and management of HINP. The park including Lucap Bay was transferred from HICDA to the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) by virtue of Section 35 of Presidential Decree No. 564 signed by President Ferdinand Marcos on October 2, 1974.

On April 27, 1982, under Proclamation No. 2183, the national park including Lucap Bay and its foreshore areas, beginning from Sitio Telbang to the east to Sitio Recudo to the west, were declared as a &quot;Tourist Zone and Marine Reserve&quot; under the control and administration of the PTA. Subsequently, under the Presidential Proclamation No. 2237 enacted on November 6, 1982, the parcels of land reserve for the Marine Fisheries Multi-Purpose Farm (created under Proclamation No. 1282 of June 21, 1974) were withdrawn and were also placed under the control and supervision of the Tourism Authority for development purposes.

In 2001, the National Committee on Geological Sciences declared the site as National Geological Monument. Executive Order No. 436 signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on June 21, 2005, transferred the administration, management, maintenance, and operation of the whole Hundred Islands National Park (HINP), including all the activities, facilities, and improvements thereafter, from the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) to the city government of Alaminos, Pangasinan in pursuit of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, which encouraged the transfer of power and authority from the national government to local government units, in line with the government&#x27;s devolution program mandated by the Constitution.

==Fauna==
The vegetation of many of the islands remain intact due to the islands&#x27; rugged and inaccessible terrain. 
Beach forest species, such as &quot;Terminalia&quot;, and agoho (&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;), are most abundant in the islands. Other abundant trees include Molave (&quot;Vitex parviflora&quot;), malaikmo (&quot;Celtis philippensis&quot;),
and sablot (&quot;Litsea glutinosa&quot;), commonly found in forests within limestone or
karst landscapes. Some exotic species are also present; among these are the fire tree (&quot;Delonix regia&quot;), calachuchi (&quot;Plumeria acuminata&quot;), atis (&quot;Annona squamosa&quot;), sineguelas (&quot;Spondias purpurea&quot;), sampaloc (&quot;Tamarindus indica&quot;), and ipil-ipil (&quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot;). Species of legumes (&quot;Fabaceae&quot;), and figs (&quot;Ficus&quot;) were also recorded in small islands.

The Sagip Lingayen Gulf Project is a study done in 2010, implemented by the Marine Environment and Resources Foundation Inc. and funded by the Dutch government, in response to the lack of resources on the terrestrial wildlife of the islands. The study assessed and created an inventory of the flora and fauna of the islands to help the city government create an environmental monitoring program to protect the island&#x27;s biodiversity.

The wildlife in this place includes bird such as the Philippine duck, white-eared brown-dove, Philippine hawk-cuckoo, Philippine coucal, Philippine bulbul, elegant tit, lemon-throated leaf-warbler, and the grey-backed tailorbird; fish such as thresher sharks, angelfish, and butterflyfish; and crustaceans such as ghost crabs and hermit crabs.

<text>Glen Innes is a suburb in East Auckland, New Zealand, located nine kilometres to the east of the city centre, close to the waters of the Tāmaki River estuary.

Glen Innes was named after a large farm owned by William Innes Taylor in the area. There were four Taylor brothers in Auckland, the sons of a British man who had had a military career in India. Three of the brothers had farms in this area and built houses; William Innes Taylor at Glen Innes, Richard James Taylor at Glendowie and Charles John Taylor at Glen Orchard (now Saint Heliers). Their brother Allan Kerr Taylor had a farm estate in Mount Albert, whose house was called Alberton.

The main streets in Glen Innes are Taniwha Street and Apirana Avenue, which meet in the shopping centre of the suburb. Glen Innes has a train station on the Eastern Line of the Auckland rail network, and is a hub for eastern Auckland isthmus buses (Metrolink).

Glen Innes is a low-income, working class area with around 1,500 state houses. In an effort to improve the quality of state housing in Glen Innes, the government introduced &quot;Talbot Park&quot;, an area of higher density housing, consisting of mostly apartment-style housing. The Tāmaki Regeneration Programme will also target 2500 public homes that will transform into 10,500 new private market, affordable and public homes across the area creating new vibrant and mixed-tenure neighbourhoods. 

== European settlement ==
The first government sale of land in Tamaki was on 1 February 1842. Allotments were bought for farming by Charles Whybrow Lidgar, John Armitage Buttery, and Patrick Anderson. William Innes Taylor arrived in Auckland in November 1843 made his first purchase of land shortly after. Taylor named the farm the Glen Innes estate. He gradually added to his land holdings and by 1862, Taylor owned around 751 acres. The site Taylor chose for his homestead is now occupied by the Glen Taylor School on West Tamaki Road. Although the homestead is no longer in existence, a Morton Bay fig tree thought to have been planted by Taylor still stands at the entrance of the school. William Innes Taylor died on 7 March 1890. By 1913, 400 acres of the Glen Innes estate had been sold. The land was described as peerless seaside sections.

== Redevelopment conflict ==

There have been protests in Glen Innes over proposals to redevelop existing state-owned housing. Housing New Zealand plans to replace houses on large sections with more &quot;intensive development&quot;, including many conversions to privately owned and sold housing with profits going to developers such as property mogul, Murdoch Dryden. This involves removing tenants from properties some have lived in for long periods. Many protests have resulted in arrests of demonstrators, including Mana Party MP Hone Harawira on one occasion, as well as a number of reported police brutality cases. Housing New Zealand argues that the development will &quot;make better use of land&quot; and enable the provision of higher quality homes to their tenants, however community members argue it is a gentrification process which is tearing apart their community.

<doc id="1268695" wikidata="Q1612679" url="?curid=1268695" title="Chrysophyllum cainito">
<text>Chrysophyllum cainito is a tropical tree of the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the Isthmus of Panama, where it was domesticated. It has spread to the Greater Antilles and the West Indies and is now grown throughout the tropics, including Southeast Asia. It grows rapidly and reaches 20 meters in height.

==Name==
The common names cainito and caimito likely come from the Mayan words (juice), (breast), and (sap), via Spanish. Star apple is a common name. It is also known as the purple apple.

==Description==
===Tree===
The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple oval, entire, 5–15 cm long; the underside shines with a golden color when seen from a distance. The tiny flowers are purplish white and have a sweet fragrant smell. The tree is also hermaphroditic (self-fertile). It produces a strong odor.

===Fruit===
The fruit is globose and typically measures from 2 to 3 inches in diameter. When ripe, it usually has purple skin with a faint green area appearing around the calyx. A radiating star pattern is visible in the pulp. Greenish-white and yellow-fruited cultivars are sometimes available. The skin is rich in latex, and both it and the rind are not edible. The flattened seeds are light brown and hard. It is a seasonal fruit bearing tree.

The fruits are used as a fresh dessert fruit; it is sweet and often served chilled. The fruit also exists in three colors, dark purple, greenish brown and yellow. The purple fruit has a denser skin and texture while the greenish brown fruit has a thin skin and a more liquid pulp; the yellow variety is less common.

A number of related species, also called star apples, are grown in Africa including &quot;Gambeya albida&quot; and &quot;G. africana&quot;.

<doc id="1268696" wikidata="Q948260" url="?curid=1268696" title="Hard Candy (Counting Crows album)">
<text>Hard Candy is the fourth studio album by American rock band Counting Crows, released in the United Kingdom on July 7, 2002, and the following day in the United States.

The album features the hidden track &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, a Joni Mitchell cover. This was one of their biggest radio hits from the album; re-releases were revised to mention the song. Originally the song did not include Vanessa Carlton and the standard version caught the ear of a producer who added it to the movie &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; adding Carlton&#x27;s voice to the track. This version topped the VH-1 charts and &quot;American Top 40 f&quot;or a while. A new version of the song &quot;Holiday in Spain&quot;, recorded as a duet in English and Dutch with Dutch band BLØF, became a number-one hit in the Netherlands.

==Reception==

Reviews hailed the album as the best release from Counting Crows since their debut album &quot;August and Everything After&quot; (1993), with the albums of the mid-1990s being &quot;long, and drawn out&quot;, likely due to lead singer Adam Duritz&#x27;s state of mind at that time, one reviewer happily announced that, &quot;&quot;Hard Candy&quot; is crisp and tight, packed with three- and four-minute shots of radio friendly fare&quot;, and that during a time when hard rock is the standard, the band are not afraid of a sound that is in the title track, compared to the Byrds, and with its &quot;Allman-esque&quot; twin guitars, echoes The Band in &quot;If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)&quot;. The album has received a score of 69 out of 100 based on &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; from Metacritic.

However, the cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; was met with searing criticism, with &quot;The Village Voice&quot; naming it the worst song of the 2000s: Additionally, &quot;NME&quot; also included this cover on its list of the worst songs of the 2000s, and &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; highlighted this song in its &quot;Terrible Classic Rock Covers&quot; series.

<doc id="1268698" wikidata="Q5936895" url="?curid=1268698" title="Human Arts Ensemble">
<text>The Human Arts Ensemble was a 1970s musical collective operating in St. Louis, Missouri. Members explored free jazz and loosely associated themselves with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and the Black Artists&#x27; Group (BAG) collective. It was formed in 1971 with the idea that performers could perform in the ensemble, without restrictions as to the performer&#x27;s race. Additionally, public funding had ended for musical associations that were suspected of having connections with radical organizations. It disbanded in 1977.

Human Arts Ensemble co-founder, saxophonist James Marshall, continues to pursue the vision of HAE to this day in Tucson, Arizona. Originally, after its activity in St. Louis, Jim and his then wife (and HAE co-founder) Carol, moved to Oregon to continue the project there in the context of a musician&#x27;s commune. Unfortunately, neither the marriage (they&#x27;re still friends) nor the commune lasted. However, when Jim moved to Tucson, Arizona, he continued to pursue his vision of free form and soulful jazz improvisation.

Jim worked closely with another partner from the St. Louis days—Ajule Eneke Rutlin, who died suddenly in 2006. Ajule had been associated with the Black Artists Group, which inspired the foundation of HAE, and was also a founding member of HAE. The Human Arts Ensemble was not only committed to the beauty that can emerge from humans interacting freely and without restriction, but it also consciously, from the beginning, saw its music as a direct, soulful contradiction to a world of hate produced by racism, consumerism, greed, and war. To this day, the new incarnation of HAE that exists in Tucson still maintains that vision. During the 90&#x27;s Human Arts Ensemble played benefits to raise money for Iraqi civilians suffering under the effect of US/UN sanctions, and HAE members have regularly performed at anti-war protests.

<doc id="1268700" wikidata="Q5395888" url="?curid=1268700" title="Ertar">
<text>Ertar is an alternative reality project, created by a group of Czech science fiction fans, led by D.Cap. The theme evolved from work on an officially unrecognized fan magazine named Light Years (Svetelne roky), founded in 1982, that as mainly a means of information on science fiction movies seen abroad. From the year 1985 on regular meetings of the fan magazine readers (READERCON) were organised. 

After November 1989 more science fiction films started to be accessible in Czechoslovakia and the fan club turned to a wider spectrum of activities. Though the film fan magazine continued its existence, the club activities were centered on creating a modern Utopian republic known as Ertar situated on a planet Ergea. Special conventions (ERCON) and new-year meetings (KVIDO) take place every year, contributing new facts to the mosaic of this parallel world.

Fan activities (&quot;Ertology&quot;) are based on creating reports on a parallel world named Ertar, on the planet Ergea, manufacturing artifacts &quot;brought&quot; from there, and taking an active part in science fiction conventions. Honorary members of the fan club included famous Czech writer and musician Jaroslav Velinský (Kapitán Kid), whose songs were used in the &quot;restoration&quot; of some Ertarian artifacts. In the recent years the importance of the fan magazine Light Years is gaining again. Instead of providing a basic information of unavailable SF movies the magazine provides guiding in the growing pool of SF movies now available.

<text>Chrysophyllum is a group of trees in the Sapotaceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753.

The genus is native to the tropical Americas, from Mexico to northern Argentina, including the Caribbean. One species, &quot;C. oliviforme&quot;, extends north to southern Florida.

==Description==
&quot;Chrysophyllum&quot; members are usually tropical trees, often growing rapidly to 10–20 m or more in height. The leaves are oval, 3–15 cm long, green above, densely golden pubescent below, from which the genus is named. The flowers are small (3–8 mm), purplish white and have a sweet fragrant smell; they are clustered several together, and are hermaphroditic (self fertile). The fruit is edible; round, usually purple skinned (sometimes greenish-white), often green around the calyx, with a star pattern in the pulp; the flattened seeds are light brown and hard. The fruit skin is chewy like gum, and contrary to some reports, is edible.

<text>Yury Vasilevich Yaremenko (Юрий Васильевич Ярёменко) (1935 August 8 -1996 September 18) was a Soviet and Russian economist, member of the Academy of Sciences (from 1994) and Director of the Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Academy. He was especially noted for his work in multisectoral (input-output) economics and for his concept of the multi-level economy, a description of how the planned economy of the Soviet Union actually worked.

==Youth and education==

He was born in Chita in eastern Siberia, 300 miles east of Lake Baikal and 100 miles north of China. His father worked in a repair shop for railroad cars. This work would have exempted him from military service in World War II, but he chose to enlist and served in a tank crew. After the war, he was stationed in Germany for two years, where he was joined by his wife, ten-year-old Yuri, and a younger sister. After two years, they returned to the Ukraine. From there Yuri was able to enter Moscow State University in 1953. From his first year, he began to study Chinese and the economy of China. After graduation, he was sent in November 1957 to study economics at the People&#x27;s University in Beijing. He graduated there in 1960 and returned to Moscow at just the moment when relations between China and the Soviet Union dramatically worsened. Despite his exceptional knowledge of Chinese institutions and language, he could find no appropriate work that used them. Nevertheless, during the rest of his life, he followed events in China closely, wrote about them, and taught courses on the economy of China at Moscow State University.

==Professional career==

After six months as a translator for Intourist, he accepted a job in the newly organized Economic Research Institute (НИЭИ) in Gosplan. the State Planning Commission. There he came to recognize the importance of forecasting and envisioning of the future. In 1973, he and several other members of this Institute moved to the Central Economic-Mathematical Institute (ЦЭМИ) of the Academy of Sciences, where he was a deputy director and head of a laboratory. In 1985, he became a Deputy Director of the newly organized Institute of Economic Forecasting in the Academy of Sciences. Following the death in 1987 of the founding director of this Institute, A. I. Anchishkin, Yaremenko became its director and served in this capacity until his sudden death of a heart attack that began in his office.

In 1987 he was made a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences; and in 1994, a full member. In 1990 -1991, he served on the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, the Five Year Plans were set in 20-year outlooks on economic, scientific and technical development which were primarily the work of Yaremenko.

His most fundamental contribution to economics was the working out of the theory of the multilevel economy. In this theory, different levels of the economy have access to resources of different quality. There had been various economic theories of socialism. Yaremenko&#x27;s work, however, was unique in describing theoretically and analytically how it actually worked in the Soviet Union.

Yaremenko was one of the principal economic advisers to Mikhail Gorbachev, last president of the USSR. Yaremenko warned that simply discontinuing central planning and opening the country to foreign trade would lead to collapse of consumer goods sectors which could not compete with imports. Rather, the system of priorities should first be used to transform the economy&#x27;s structure to something approximating that of market economy. This advice was not heeded, and the consequences were much as he had anticipated. In the 1990s, he was sharply critical of the policies adopted by the Russian government. He was not at all opposed to an orderly transition to a market economy but felt that the “shock therapy” approach was needlessly costly.

Throughout his professional career, he was much concerned with sources of information on the economy. On weekends, he often went to the Lenin library to see what the technical journals had to offer about the economic situation in various industries. In the 1990s, he engaged a sociologist, S. A. Belonovskiï, to interview plant managers around the country. In 1993 and again in 1995, Belonovskiï interviewed Yaremenko. After his death, these interviews were edited by Belonovskiï and G. A. Yaremenko into a book, &quot;Economic Conversations&quot;, which appeared in 1998. They afford a unique and altogether remarkable commentary on the dramatic events in the Russian economy during the first half of the 1990s.
In October 2015, the year of the 80th anniversary of Yaremenko&#x27;s birth, the Economic Forecasting Institute of the Academy of Sciences held a three-day conference to honor his memory. The first day was devoted to analysis of the current economic situation; the second, to economic modeling; and the third, to studies on the economy of China. For this occasion, the Institute issued a one-volume collection of Yaremenko&#x27;s most important works.

<text>John Kent Cooley (November 25, 1927 – August 6, 2008) was an American journalist and author who specialized in islamist groups and the Middle East. Based in Athens, he worked as a radio and off-air television correspondent for &quot;ABC News&quot; and was a long-time contributing editor to the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;.

Cooley was one of only a handful of Western journalists widely regarded and trusted in the Middle East as an expert on the area&#x27;s history and politics. He interviewed several of the region&#x27;s heads of state and was personally acquainted with the senior leadership of the PLO. His many awards include the Council on Foreign Relations&#x27; Fellowship for American Foreign Correspondents, and the coveted George Polk Award for distinguished career achievement in international reporting. He was a key part of the &quot;ABC News&quot; &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; team that won an Emmy in 1990 for its investigation into the December 21, 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.

==Background==
A graduate of Dartmouth College, Cooley served with the U.S. Army in postwar Austria from 1946 to 1947. Returning to America, he undertook his postgraduate studies at the New School University in New York City, then began his journalistic career at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. He lived in North Africa from 1953 to 1964, covering the Algerian War for &quot;UPI&quot;, &quot;NBC News&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;, and in 1965 became Middle East correspondent for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; in Beirut.

==Middle East==
A personal friend of King Hussein of Jordan, Cooley interviewed most of the Middle East&#x27;s heads of state, including Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Anwar al-Sadat, David Ben-Gurion, and the Shah of Iran. He interviewed Yasser Arafat many times and was acquainted with the senior leadership of Fatah and the other secular Palestinian groups.

A personal friend of Ardeshir Zahedi with whom he had a 50 years old friendship and kept corresponding till he died in 2008.

Cooley and his wife Vania were among 90 foreign residents of the InterContinental and Philadelphia hotels in Amman who were taken hostage in June 1970 by George Habash of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and released after the personal intervention of King Hussein.

Cooley worked with Pierre Salinger on the Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.

==September 11, 2001 attacks==
Cooley wrote in the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; on May 23, 2002, that Jordan&#x27;s General Intelligence Division (GID), which since the early 1990s has been tracking CIA and Pakistani-trained Arab guerrillas, intercepted an al-Qaeda communication between July 5 and August 6, 2001, deemed so important that it was relayed immediately by King Abdullah&#x27;s men to Washington through the CIA station in the U.S. Embassy in Amman. It was also passed through an Arab intermediary to a German intelligence agent, allegedly to make sure it reached Washington.

The communication stated that a major attack was planned for inside the U.S. and that aircraft would be used. The code name of the operation, wrote Cooley, was &quot;Al Ourus al-Kabir&quot; — &quot;The Big Wedding.&quot;

He wrote for the &quot;Monitor&quot;.

<doc id="1268710" wikidata="Q3503405" url="?curid=1268710" title="Sula (novel)">
<text>Sula is a 1973 novel by American author Toni Morrison, her first novel to be published after &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; (1970).

==Plot summary==
===Background===
The Bottom was a Black neighborhood on a hill above the fictional town of Medallion, Ohio, set to be bulldozed at the beginning of the novel for the creation of a golf course. The Bottom originated as an agreement between a white farmer and his Black slave. The farmer had promised freedom and a piece of valley land to his slave should he complete some difficult chores. Upon the completion of the chores, the farmer regrets his end of the bargain, no longer wanting to give up the land. In order to get out of the arrangement, the farmer feigns regret to the slave over having to give him valley land rather than &quot;Bottom&quot; land. The farmer claimed that &quot;Bottom&quot; land (actually located on top of a hill) would be better than valley land because it was closer to the bottom of heaven. 

===Synopsis===
The story is organized by chronological chapters labeled with years. In &quot;1919,&quot; the first named character, handsome Shadrack returns from World War I a shattered man, suffering from shell shock or PTSD and unable to accept the world he used to belong in. As a way to compartmentalize the unpredictable nature of death, Shadrack invents a National Suicide Day to be held annually on January 3. Shadrack proposed that Medallion citizens could kill themselves or each other on this day and be free from death for the rest of the year. The town begrudgingly accepts Shadrack as a part of their community despite his outbursts. 
In &quot;1920&quot; and &quot;1921,&quot; the narrator contrasts the families of the children Nel Wright and Sula Peace, who both grow up with no father figure. Nel, the product of a mother knee-deep in social conventions, grows up in a stable home. Nel is initially torn between the rigid conventionality of her mother Helene Wright, who dislikes Sula&#x27;s family instantly, and her inherent curiosity about the world, which she discovers on a trip. Though she vows to explore more of the world, she ultimately never leaves The Bottom again. This experience ultimately prompts Nel to begin a friendship with Sula. The Peace family is the opposite: Sula lives with her grandmother Eva and her mother Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric, loose, yet Hannah was genuinely loved by all men, and Eva was very respected by all women. Their house serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of boarders. The extremely strained relationship between Hannah and Eva is revealed. 
Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other as adolescents. They share every part of their lives, including the shared memory of a traumatic event. One day, they playfully swing a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. Sula loses her grip, and he falls into a nearby river and drowns. They do not tell anyone of their role in his death. Though Sula grieves with guilt, Nel feels relief after deciding that the event is primarily Sula&#x27;s fault. Shadrack lives in a shack by the river&#x27;s edge, and the girls are uncertain if he witnessed Chicken Little&#x27;s death. To determine if he saw, Sula visits the shack alone and is surprised at its orderliness. Sula is unable to confront Shadrack through her tears. He comforts her and she runs away, accidentally leaving behind her belt. Shadrack hangs the belt on his wall in memory of his only visitor.

One day, Hannah tries to light a fire outside and her dress catches fire. Eva sees this happening from upstairs and jumps out the window in an attempt to save her daughter&#x27;s life. Sula, who was sitting on the porch, simply watched her mother burn. An ambulance comes, but Hannah dies en route to the hospital, with Eva injured as well. Other residents of the Bottom believe Sula remained still because she was stunned by the incident. Eva believes that Sula stood and watched out of curiosity. 
As an adult, Nel chooses to get married, breaking the childhood promise of the girls to share everything. Sula lives a life of ardent independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel&#x27;s wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for 10 years. She has many affairs and attends college. When she returns to the Bottom and to Nel, who became a conventional wife and mother, they reconcile briefly. 

The rest of the town grows to resent Sula, in part because of her many affairs with married men. The husbands start a rumor that Sula slept with white men, worsening the town&#x27;s opinion of Sula. The town&#x27;s hatred of Sula gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another, as well as treat each other better. Sula&#x27;s affairs give the wives a reason to soothe the bruised egos of their husbands, while Sula&#x27;s lack of family at her age is scorned by all the women and causes them to be better mothers. Though Shadrack is typically vulgar and shocking to other townspeople, he treats Sula with respect. 

Nel and Sula end their friendship after Sula has an affair with Nel&#x27;s husband Jude. Just before Sula died in 1940, they reconciled half-heartedly. With Sula&#x27;s death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolved. Sula dies alone with no one to attend her funeral. Shadrack, whose PTSD has faded enough for loneliness to crawl back in, is the only one saddened by her death.

Nel never remarries and becomes an overbearing mother. The Bottom slowly dissolves after Sula&#x27;s death, becoming a different place. Nel visits Eva in 1965 in an elderly care facility, where Eva tells her that she knew about the death of Chicken Little. Nel replies that the blame is just on Sula but remembers her old promise to Sula to share everything. 

Nel says goodbye to Sula at her gravestone, realizing that her loneliness is not from missing her ex-husband but from missing Sula. She cries in grief as she recalls the years spent without her.

==Characters==
*Sula Peace: Nel&#x27;s childhood best friend, whose return to the Bottom disrupts the whole community. The main reason for Sula&#x27;s strangeness is her defiance of gender norms and traditional morality, symbolized by the birthmark &quot;that spread from the middle of the lid toward the eyebrow, shaped something like a stemmed rose,&quot; which, according to some psychoanalytic readings, is a dual symbol with both phallic and vaginal resonance.
*Eva Peace: Sula&#x27;s grandmother, who is missing one leg. Though the circumstances are never fully explained, it is suggested that she purposely put it under a train in order to collect insurance money to support her three young children after her husband left her. She has a peculiar relationship with her children. She passes on to Hannah and then Sula a need for male attention. 
*BoyBoy: Sula&#x27;s grandfather, who leaves Eva for another woman.
*Hannah Peace: Sula&#x27;s mother; Eva&#x27;s eldest daughter. She married Rekus, who died when Sula was three years old. Hannah is a promiscuous and care-free woman who later burns to death in front of her mother and daughter. Her daughter Sula witnessed the fire but did nothing, while her mother tried to save her by jumping on top of her from her bedroom window.
*Eva (Pearl) Peace: Sula&#x27;s aunt; Eva Sr.&#x27;s youngest daughter and middle child. She married at fourteen and moved to Michigan.
*Ralph (Plum) Peace: Sula&#x27;s uncle; Eva&#x27;s son and youngest child. Plum was a WWI veteran and a heroin addict. Eva burns him alive with kerosene because of his mental instability.
*Helene Wright: Nel&#x27;s strait-laced and clean mother. Though the daughter of a prostitute, she was raised by her devoutly religious grandmother, Cecile.
*Nel Wright: Sula&#x27;s best friend (can also be considered a main protagonist) who does not want to be like her mother because she will never be reduced to &quot;custard&quot; and she will not be humiliated by other people as her mother is. Nel is the opposite of Sula: she decided to marry, have children and stay in the Bottom when she became an adult. She is Sula&#x27;s best friend as they are children and then their relationship turns into something more complex when Jude left Nel for Sula. 
*Shadrack: A paranoid shell-shocked WWI veteran, who returns to Sula and Nel&#x27;s hometown, Medallion. He invents National Suicide Day.
*Jude Greene: Nel&#x27;s husband, who leaves Nel due to a love affair with Sula.
*Ajax (Albert Jacks): Sula&#x27;s confidant and lover.
*Tar Baby (Pretty Johnnie): A quiet, cowardly, and reserved partially or possibly fully white man who rents out one of the rooms in the Peace household. It is believed that Tar Baby has come up to the Bottom to drink himself to death.
*The Deweys: three boys, each about one year apart from one another in age, who were each nicknamed &quot;Dewey&quot; by Eva. Their real names are never written in the novel, and after the introduction of these characters, the three are referred to as one being, thus Morrison&#x27;s use of a lowercase &quot;d&quot; in &quot;dewey&quot; for the rest of the novel.
*Chicken Little: The little boy who drowns when Sula accidentally throws him into the river.

==Major themes==

Motherhood

Many of the novel&#x27;s female characters behave outside of typical gender norms for the time period. It is Helene&#x27;s grandmother, Cecile, who stands in as a mother figure and her primary caretaker. Eva, Sula&#x27;s grandmother, operates a boarding house and is about the business of her own version of mothering, &quot;directing the lives of her children, friends, strays, and constant stream of boarders&quot; (30). In &quot;Sula&quot;, relationships between mothers and daughters do not seem to be predicated on shared affection and a duty to protect one&#x27;s offspring. For example, Hannah, Sula&#x27;s mother is overheard in conversation with her friends, &quot;You love her, like I love Sula. I just don&#x27;t like her. That&#x27;s the difference.&quot; (57) Hannah&#x27;s comment does gesture toward a sense of duty but differs from Jacobs&#x27; as it implies an absence of a desire to mother. When Hannah challenges her mother Eva about expressions of love toward her, Eva responds by reminding Hannah of the sacrifices that she has made for her.

Doubleness

&quot;Sula&quot; demonstrates numerous doubles or parallels between the novel&#x27;s characters. For example, Sula and Eva both kill men (Sula kills Chicken Little; Eva kills Plum). The death of Chicken Little results in a closed-casket funeral (64). Likewise, for Hannah, &quot;the casket had to be kept closed at the funeral&quot; (77). Chicken died by water; Hannah died by fire. Nel watches Chicken die by drowning, according to Eva at the later scene in the nursing home (168). Sula watches Hannah die in flames (78). Both Plum and Hannah —brother and sister— die by fire (Plum is burned to death by Eva, and Hannah dies from her injuries after catching fire by accident).

Sula&#x27;s Birthmark

Sula is described as having a birthmark over one eye that darkens over the years as she matures and defies social conventions. The appearance of the birthmark is utilized to reveal how each character perceived Sula. Sula&#x27;s peers interpreted the appearance of the birthmark differently: Sula&#x27;s close friend Nel thought it looked like a rose, Sula&#x27;s affair partner Jude perceived it to be snake-shaped, and Shadrack saw the birthmark as tadpole-shaped.

==Literary significance and criticism==

&quot;Sula&quot; was integral to the formation of black feminist literary criticism. In 1977, a black feminist literary critic Barbara Smith, in her essay &quot;Toward a Black Feminist Criticism,&quot; advanced a definition of black feminist literary criticism and (in)famously performed a lesbian reading of &quot;Sula&quot;. In her 1980 essay &quot;New Directions for Black Feminist Criticism,&quot; Black feminist literary critic Deborah McDowell responded to Smith&#x27;s challenge by acknowledging the need for a black feminist criticism and calling for a firmer definition of black feminism.

In her essay &quot;Boundaries: Or Distant Relations and Close Kin&quot;, McDowell draws on the critical practices of Hortense Spillers and Hazel Carby and reads &quot;Sula&quot; from a poststructuralist perspective, urging black women critics to &quot;develop and practice […] critical approaches interactively, dialogically&quot; instead of viewing &quot;black female identity as unitary essence yielding an indigenous critical methodology.&quot; As McDowell points out, the ambiguity of Sula as a character subverts traditional binary oppositions, and &quot;transcends the boundaries of social and linguistic convention.&quot; The decentering and temporal deferral of the character who lends the novel its title similarly &quot;denies the whole notion of character as static essence, replacing it with the idea of character as process.&quot; This &quot;complex set of dynamics&quot; forces the reader to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; as well as to &quot;bridge the gaps separating [them] from the text&quot; and therefore makes them active participants in the meaning-making process.

The beauty of Morrison&#x27;s narrative is its complexity and its ability to illustrate the fluidity and valence of the black female subject as captured in the quotidian.

Roderick Ferguson elaborates on the potential of &quot;Sula&quot; as &quot;an opportunity to formulate politics&quot;. &quot;Sula&quot;, Ferguson argues, gave black lesbian feminists &quot;a model of alternative subjectivities&quot;. The novel became a useful tool to invent new ways of thinking. By illustrating alternative social relationships, it provided a way for women of color feminists to imagine new possibilities outside of the constraints of nationalism.

==Television series==
In May 2022, it was reported that HBO will adapt the novel into a television limited series. The project will be created and written by Shannon M. Houston.

<text>The Coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth or the 12·12 Military Insurrection () was a military coup which took place on December 12, 1979, in South Korea. 

==Background==
The assassination of Park Chung Hee on 26 October 1979 had thrown South Korea into a state of political turmoil. Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah immediately became acting President and declared a state of martial law throughout the nation, with the exception of Jeju-do. He would assume the role of President on 6 December 1979 when the situation was somewhat stabilized.

He appointed General Jeong Seung-hwa, the Chief of Staff of the Army to oversee the martial law operation. Jeong appointed Major General Chun Doo-hwan, commander of the Defence Security Command to investigate Park&#x27;s assassination. Jeong, Chun and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Kim Jong-hwan were the most powerful figures in the military. 

According to official investigations, President Park&#x27;s assassin and director of KCIA Kim Jae-gyu had approached Jeong, who was present at the scene of the assassination (though not a witness) to take command of the situation after Park&#x27;s assassination, but Jeong refused.

Chun, who harbored political ambitions, was a rival to Jeong, given that the Military Security Command serves as a hedge against any potential military coup under President Park.

==Coup==
On the evening of 12 December 1979, Chun , acting without authorization from President Choi Kyu-hah, ordered the arrest of Jeong on allegations of involvement in the assassination of President Park. Minister of National Defense Roh Jae-hyun assisted in the arrest of Jeong. He would resign from office following the coup.

After Jeong&#x27;s capture, the 29th Regiment of the 9th Division, along with the 1st Special Forces Brigade and 3rd Special Forces Brigade, invaded downtown Seoul to support the 30th and 33rd Capital Security Groups, which were loyal to Chun, resulting in a series of conflicts that broke out in the capital. Two of Jeong&#x27;s allies, Major General Jang Tae-wan (Commander of Army Capital Security Command) and Major General Jeong Byeong-ju (Commander of Army Special Warfare Command), were also arrested by the rebelling troops. Major Kim Oh-rang, aide-de-camp of Jeong Byeong-ju, was killed during the gunfight.

By the next morning, the Ministry of Defense and Army Headquarters were all occupied by the mutineers. Chun and his fellow graduates of the 11th class of the Korea Military Academy, such as Major General Roh Tae-woo, commanding general of 9th Infantry Division and Major General Jeong Ho-yong, were in charge of the Korean ground forces. Chun&#x27;s coup and the subsequent consolidation of power was assisted by the powerful private club of military officials known as Hanahoe. The South Korean navy and air force did not participate in the coup and Chun subsequently co-opted them following the success of the mutiny. Chun became the &quot;de facto&quot; commander-in-chief rather than President Choi Kyu-hah. 

==Aftermath==

Jeong and his associates were tried in a military court and Jeong was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

The coup marked the beginning of the end of the Fourth Republic of Korea. The mutiny, the coup of the civilian government on 17 May 1980, alongside the Gwangju Uprising, was the primary justification for Chun&#x27;s 1995 arrest by the Kim Young-sam administration.

<doc id="1268714" wikidata="Q2097067" url="?curid=1268714" title="Some Things Never Change">
<text>Some Things Never Change is the tenth album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in March 1997.

==Overview==
&quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; represented a deliberate return to the band&#x27;s earlier sound (before &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;), using more organic recording techniques than on their previous studio album. John Helliwell recounted that &quot;we recorded the album in a way that Supertramp never had and that was by all going into the studio together and doing it as a much more live thing.&quot;

The album features the single &quot;You Win, I Lose&quot;, which was a minor hit in Germany and also received considerable airplay in Canada. Two more singles were released commercially: &quot;Listen To Me Please&quot; and &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;.

The song &quot;Live to Love You&quot; (which was also released as a promo single) features both the &#x27;tackled&#x27; sound from the Coleco Electronic Quarterback handheld electronic game, as well as the Trouble &quot;Pop-o-matic bubble&quot; sounds from their 1979 hit &quot;The Logical Song&quot;.

==Cover art==
Rick Davies explained the concept behind the album cover: &quot;It&#x27;s something to tie in with the title. In England people have tea at four o&#x27;clock and it doesn&#x27;t matter where they are or what sort of social plane they&#x27;re on, they will have that tea.&quot;

==Reception==

AllMusic commented that the album retains the same style and strong instrumental interplay from the band&#x27;s glory years, but lacks the &quot;ingratiatingly catchy melodies&quot; of that era, making it of strong interest to the band&#x27;s fans but much less to casual listeners.

&quot;Give Me a Chance&quot; was not included on all editions of the album.

<text>The Standard Bank of Canada was a Canadian bank established in 1872 as the St. Lawrence Bank by a group of Toronto businessmen led by John Charles Fitch.

In 1876 it was renamed the Standard Bank of Canada following a reorganization, and under its new management it grew. By 1907 it had nearly 50 branches and added another 27 when Standard Bank acquired the Western Bank of Canada (1882-1909), a regional bank headquartered in Oshawa, Ontario. The bank began to expand into the western provinces, and later combined with the Sterling Bank in 1924. The combined entity had 243 branches, of which 176 were in Ontario. Increased competition and other strategic considerations led to the Standard Bank of Canada to merge with the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1928.

The Standard Bank of Canada issued its own banknotes, as many of Canada&#x27;s banks did in that era. Some examples of these notes can be seen at the Bank of Canada&#x27;s Currency Museum.

<text>Stephen Winsten (1893–1991) was the name adopted by Samuel Weinstein, one of the &#x27;Whitechapel Boys&#x27; group of young Jewish men and future writers in London&#x27;s East End in the years before World War I (the others included Isaac Rosenberg, John Rodker and Joseph Leftwich). In the First World War he was a conscientious objector, and imprisoned in Bedford and Reading gaols. He is now known for his works about George Bernard Shaw, and his writing on the life of Henry Salt.

He married the artist Clara Birnberg (1894–1989); they both became Quakers. She as Clare Winsten is known for some sculptures, including one of St. Joan in the garden of Shaw’s house in Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire, where Shaw and the Winstens were neighbours. Stephen&#x27;s and Clara&#x27;s daughter Ruth Harrison, a conscientious objector in WW2, was known as a campaigner for animal rights.

<text>Beloved is a 1987 novel by American novelist Toni Morrison. Set in the period after the American Civil War, the novel tells the story of a dysfunctional family of formerly enslaved people whose Cincinnati home is haunted by a malevolent spirit. The narrative of &quot;Beloved&quot; derives from the life of Margaret Garner, an enslaved person in the slave state of Kentucky who escaped and fled to the free state of Ohio in 1856.

Garner was subject to capture under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and when U.S. marshals broke into the cabin where she and her children had barricaded themselves, she was attempting to kill her children—and had already killed her youngest daughter—in hopes of sparing them from being returned to slavery. Morrison&#x27;s main inspiration for the novel was an account of the event titled &quot;A Visit to the Slave Mother who Killed Her Child&quot; in an 1856 newspaper article initially published in the &quot;American Baptist&quot; and reproduced in &quot;The Black Book&quot;, an anthology of texts of Black history and culture that Morrison had edited in 1974.

The novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction a year after its publication, and was a finalist for the 1987 National Book Award. A survey of writers and literary critics compiled by &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked it as the best work of American fiction from 1981 to 2006. It was adapted as a 1998 movie of the same name, starring Oprah Winfrey.

==Background==
The book&#x27;s dedication reads &quot;Sixty Million and more&quot;, referring to the Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the Atlantic slave trade. The book&#x27;s epigraph is from Romans 9:25 (King James Bible): &quot;I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.&quot;

==Plot summary==
&quot;Beloved&quot; begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, with Sethe (pronounced ), a formerly enslaved woman, and her 18-year-old daughter, Denver, who live at 124 Bluestone Road. The site has been haunted for years by what they believe is the ghost of Sethe&#x27;s eldest daughter. Denver is shy, friendless, and housebound. Sethe&#x27;s sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away from home by the age of 13, which she believes was due to the ghost. Baby Suggs, the mother of Sethe&#x27;s husband, Halle, died soon after the boys fled, eight years before the start of the novel.

One day, Paul D, one of the enslaved men from Sweet Home, the plantation where Sethe, Halle, Baby Suggs, and several others were once enslaved, arrives at Sethe&#x27;s home. He forces out the spirit, receiving Denver&#x27;s contempt for driving away her only companion, but persuades them to leave the house together for the first time in years for a carnival. Upon returning home, they find a young woman sitting in front of the house who calls herself Beloved. Paul D is suspicious and warns Sethe, but she is charmed by the young woman and ignores him. Denver is eager to care for the sickly Beloved, whom she begins to believe is her older sister come back.

Paul D begins to feel increasingly uncomfortable in the house and that he is being driven out. One night, Paul D is cornered by Beloved, who tells him to touch her on her &quot;inside part.&quot; While they have sex, his mind is filled with horrific memories from his past, including the sexual violence inflicted upon him and the other men while in a chain gang. Paul D tries to tell Sethe about it, but cannot. Instead, he says that he wants her pregnant. Sethe is afraid to have to live for a baby. When Paul D tells friends at work about his plans to start a new family, they react fearfully. One, Stamp Paid, reveals the reason for the community&#x27;s rejection of Sethe by showing Paul D a newspaper clipping of an article about a fugitive woman who killed her child.

Paul D confronts Sethe, who tells him that after escaping and joining her children at 124, four horsemen came to return her children and her to a life of slavery. Sethe, terrified of returning to Sweet Home and its vicious manager Schoolteacher, ran to the woodshed with her children to kill them, but only managed to kill her eldest daughter. Sethe says that she was &quot;trying to put my babies where they would be safe&quot;. Paul D leaves, telling her her love is &quot;too thick&quot; and chastising that &quot;you&#x27;ve got two feet, not four.&quot; Sethe retorts that &quot;thin love is no love&quot;, adamant that she did the right thing.

Sethe comes to believe that Beloved is the daughter she had killed, as &quot;BELOVED&quot; was all she could afford to have engraved on her tombstone. She is overjoyed, holding onto a hope that Halle and her sons will come back and they will all be a family together. Out of guilt, she begins to spend all of her time and money on Beloved to please her and try to explain her actions, and loses her job. Beloved becomes angry and demanding, throwing tantrums when she does not get her way. Beloved&#x27;s presence consumes Sethe&#x27;s life. She hardly eats, while Beloved grows bigger and bigger, eventually taking the form of a pregnant woman. Denver reveals her fear of Sethe, having known that she killed Beloved, but not having understood why, and that her brothers shared this fear and ran away due to it. Sethe and Beloved&#x27;s voices merge until indistinguishable, and Denver observes that Sethe becomes more like a child, while Beloved seems more like the mother.

Denver reaches out to the Black community for help, from whom they had been isolated because of envy of Baby Suggs&#x27; privilege and horror at Sethe killing her two-year-old daughter. Local women come to the house to exorcise Beloved. At the same time, their White landlord, Mr. Bodwin, arrives to offer a job to Denver, who had asked him for work. Not knowing this, Sethe attacks him with an ice pick, thinking he was Schoolteacher coming back for her daughter. The village women and Denver hold her back and Beloved disappears.

Denver becomes a working member of the community, and Paul D returns to a bed-ridden Sethe, who, devastated at Beloved&#x27;s disappearance, remorsefully tells him that Beloved was her &quot;best thing&quot;. He replies that Sethe is her own &quot;best thing&quot;, leaving her questioning, &quot;Me? Me?&quot; As time goes on, those who knew Beloved gradually forget her until all traces of her are gone.

==Major themes==

===Mother-daughter relationships===
The maternal bonds between Sethe and her children inhibit her own individuation and prevent the development of her self. Sethe develops a dangerous maternal passion that results in killing one daughter, her own &quot;best self.&quot; Her surviving daughter becomes estranged from the Black community. Both outcomes result from Sethe trying to salvage her &quot;fantasy of the future,&quot; her children, from a life in slavery.

In Ohio, Sethe fails to recognize her daughter Denver&#x27;s need for interaction with the Black community to enter into womanhood. At the end of the novel, Denver succeeds in establishing her own self and embarking on her individuation with the help of Beloved. Sethe only becomes individuated after Beloved&#x27;s exorcism. Then, she is free to fully accept the first relationship that is completely &quot;for her,&quot; her relationship with Paul D. This relationship relieves her from the self-destruction she was causing based on her maternal bonds with her children.

Beloved and Sethe are both emotionally impaired, which comes from Sethe having been enslaved. Under slavery, mothers lost their children, with devastating consequences for both. Baby Suggs dealt with this by refusing to become close with her children and remembering what she could of them, but Sethe tried to hold onto them and fight for them, to the point of killing them so they could be free. Sethe was traumatized by having had her milk stolen, unable to form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter by feeding her.

===Psychological effects of slavery===

Because of the suffering under slavery, most former slaves tried to repress these memories in an attempt to forget the past. This repression and dissociation from the past causes a fragmentation of the self and a loss of true identity. Sethe, Paul D., and Denver all suffered a loss of self, which could only be remedied when they were able to reconcile their pasts and memories of earlier identities. Beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories, eventually leading to the reintegration of their selves.

Slavery splits a person into a fragmented figure. The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a &quot;self that is no self&quot;. To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events, and retell the painful memories. As a result of suffering, the &quot;self&quot; becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking, once acknowledged by an audience becomes real. Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs, who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake themselves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The &quot;self&quot; is located in a word, defined by others. The power lies in the audience, or more precisely, in the word—once the word changes, so does the identity. All of the characters in &quot;Beloved&quot; face the challenge of an unmade self, composed of their &quot;rememories&quot; and defined by perceptions and language. The barrier that keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an &quot;uncomplicated past&quot; and the fear that remembering will lead them to &quot;a place they couldn&#x27;t get back from&quot;.

=== Definition of manhood ===
The discussion of manhood and masculinity is foreshadowed by the dominant meaning of Sethe&#x27;s story. &quot;Beloved&quot; depicts slavery in two main emotions: Love and Self-Preservation; however, Morrison does more than depict emotions.

The author accurately depicts the horrors of enslavement and its effects to communicate the morals of manhood. It also distorts a man from himself. Morrison revealed different pathways to the meaning of manhood by her stylistic devices. She established new information for understanding the legacy of slavery best depicted through stylistic devices. To understand Paul D&#x27;s perception of manhood, Morrison deliberately inserts his half-formed words and thoughts, to provide the audience a taste of what is going on inside his mind.
Yet, throughout the novel, Paul D&#x27;s depiction of manhood was being constantly challenged by the norms and values of white culture. The author demonstrates the distinctions between Western and African values, and how the dialogue between the two values is heard through juxtaposition and allusions. Scholar Zakiyyah Iman Jackson has argued that Paul D&#x27;s reduced manhood emerges in relation to a discourse of animality. Morrison maneuvered her message through the social atmosphere of her words, which was further highlighted by the character&#x27;s motives and actions.

Paul D is a victim of racism in that his dreams and goals are so high that he will never be able to achieve them because of racism. He thought he earned his right to reach each of his goals because of his sacrifices and what he has been through, that society would pay him back and allow him to do what his heart desired.

After Reconstruction (1890–1910)

During the Reconstruction era, Jim Crow laws were put in place to limit the movement and involvement of African Americans in the White-dominant society. Black men during this time had to establish their own identity, which may seem impossible due to all the limitations put upon them. Many Black men, like Paul D, struggled to find their meaning in their society and achieving their goals because of the &quot;disabilities&quot; that constrained them to a certain part of the social hierarchy.

In &quot;Beloved,&quot; Stamp Paid observes Paul D sitting on the base of the church steps &quot;… liquor bottle in hand, stripped of the very maleness that enables him to caress and love the wounded Sethe…&quot; (132). Throughout the novel, Paul D is sitting on a base of some sort or a foundation like a tree stub or the steps, for instance. This exemplifies his place in society. Black men are the foundation of society because without their hard labor, the white men would not profit. They were coerced into the society where they were deemed &quot;lower-status&quot; because of the color of their skin.
=== Family relationships ===
Family relationships are an instrumental element of &quot;Beloved,&quot; which help visualize the stress and the dismantlement of African-American families in this era. The slavery system did not allow African Americans to have rights to themselves, their family, their belongings, or their children. So, Sethe killing Beloved was deemed a peaceful act because Sethe believed that killing her daughter was saving her. By doing this, their family is divided and fragmented, much like the time in which they were living. After the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, formerly enslaved families were broken and bruised because of the hardships they faced while they were enslaved.

Since enslaved people could not participate in societal events, they put their faith and trust in the supernatural. They performed rituals and prayed to their god or multiple gods.

In the novel, Beloved, who was murdered at the hands of her mother Sethe, haunts Sethe. For example, Sethe, Denver, and Paul D go to the neighborhood carnival, which happens to be Sethe&#x27;s first social outing since killing her daughter. When they return home, Beloved appears at the house. Throughout the novel, Sethe believes that the person claiming to be Beloved is her daughter that she killed 18 years prior - a scenario that shows how [fractured] family relationships are used to display the mental strife the protagonist faces.

=== Pain ===
The pain throughout this novel is universal because everyone involved in slavery was heavily scarred, whether that be physically, mentally, sociologically, or psychologically. Some of the characters tend to &quot;romanticize&quot; their pain, in a way that each experience is a turning point in one&#x27;s life. This concept is played throughout history in early Christian contemplative tradition and African-American blues tradition.

&quot;Beloved&quot; is a book of the systematic torture that people who had been enslaved had to deal with after the Emancipation Proclamation. Therefore, in this novel, the narrative is like a complex labyrinth because all the characters have been &quot;stripped away&quot; from their voices, their narratives, their language in a way that their sense of self is diminished. Also, all the characters have had different experiences with slavery, which is why their stories and their narratives are distinct from each other.

In addition to the pain, many major characters try to beautify pain in a way that diminishes what was done. For example, Sethe keeps repeating what a White girl said about her scars on her back, calling them &quot;a Choke-cherry tree. Trunk, branches, and even leaves&quot;. She repeats this to everyone, suggesting she is trying to find the beauty in her scar, even when they caused her extreme pain. Paul D and Baby Suggs both look away in disgust and deny this description of Sethe&#x27;s scars. Sethe does the same with Beloved. The memory of her ghost-like daughter plays a role of memory, grief, and spite that separates Sethe and her late daughter. For instance, Beloved stays in the house with Paul D and Sethe. A home is a place of vulnerability, where the heart lies. Paul D and Baby Suggs both suggest that Beloved is not invited into the home, but Sethe says otherwise because she sees Beloved, all grown and alive, instead of the pain of when Sethe murdered her. At the end of the book, Beloved is gone and Paul D encourages Sethe to love herself instead.

===Heroism===
Per her definition of heroism as the ability to do what one deems right in the face of opposition and to inspire others to escape the pain of their past, the book may be trying to convey that societally, heroism is not absolute but, rather, relative to past experience and the influence of the community; the literary characterization of Sethe and Denver are written in a way that further support this.

Developing Sethe not as a conventional hero but as an individual capable of allowing those she cares for to break from the shackles of the past, Morrison depicts Sethe as a certain definition of heroism. Sethe&#x27;s decision to kill her own child, Beloved, is thoroughly scorned by the community, despite her fear that Schoolteacher is coming to take her family back into slavery. Yet Sethe herself never doubts her own veracity, justifying, “It ain’t my job to know what’s worse. It’s my job to know what is and to keep them away from what I know is terrible. I did that” (194). Sethe contrasts the role society proclaims for her, to refrain from murdering her children and try to deal with the problem of Schoolteacher&#x27;s arrival peacefully, and the role she assumes for herself, to kill her children to ensure that they will not be forced to experience the same venomous anguish of life as a slave. From Sethe&#x27;s point of view, the only method that would have resulted in the complete safety of her children was to kill her children and “keep them away from what [she] know[s] is terrible,” because death is far more preferable to life back in the confines of slavery. Beyond just having the courage to stand up for what she believes in, Sethe also demonstrates her heroism by helping Paul D deal with his own painful past. When he visits Sethe near the end of the novel, Paul D reminisces about “Her tenderness about his neck jewelry — its three wands, like attentive baby rattlers, curving two feet into the air. How she never mentioned or looked at it, so he did not have to feel the shame of being collared like a beast. Only this woman Sethe could have left him his manhood like that. He wants to put his story next to hers” (322). Paul D&#x27;s intimate experiences with the iron bit have changed him forever, stripping him of his masculinity and contributing to a deep mental storm tormenting him from within. Morrison utilizes metaphor to compare the iron bit to “three wands, like attentive baby rattlers, curving two feet into the air,” underscoring that the venomous influence of the iron bit, much like the bite of a rattlesnake, strikes in three different ways, damaging physical, cognitive, and emotional abilities. Paul D draws support from Sethe “never mention[ing] or look[ing]” at his scars, but more so, this allows him to retain his own manhood, which to Paul D defines the very basis of his character.

Although Sethe defies opposition to her heroic acts of freeing others from their past, Denver defies the confinements of her past, allowing her to help Sethe escape Beloved&#x27;s parasitism that keeps her from a livable life and foreseeable future. Feeling trapped by her isolation at 124 Bluestone Road, Denver is challenged by the concept of leaving Sethe and Beloved behind, needing the courage to set foot beyond the house to seek the aid of the community she was once a part of. As Sethe and Beloved remained trapped in the house, the tipping point of heroism for Denver comes when she realizes “neither Beloved nor Sethe seemed to care what the next day might bring. Denver knew it was on her. She would have to leave the yard; step off the edge of the world, leave the two behind and go ask somebody for help” (286). By using the metaphorical image of Denver “step[ing] off the edge of the world,” to describe Denver leaving “the yard” in an effort to rewrite society&#x27;s conceptions of her isolation and Sethe&#x27;s horrible past actions, Morrison elucidates her courage to leave the only world she knows to “ask somebody for help.” Also realizing that Sethe and Beloved did not “seem to care what the next day might bring,” Denver recognizes that she must free her mother from the past&#x27;s reach to encourage her to plan for the “next day” and for a future beyond Beloved&#x27;s grasp. Overcoming her preconceptions of the outside community allows Denver to surpass Morrison&#x27;s threshold of heroism, rescuing Sethe from the suppressive grip of the past through Beloved. When Beloved&#x27;s influence becomes more and more detrimental to the environment of 124 Bluestone Road and Sethe&#x27;s outlook on life, Denver does not hesitate to thrust herself into a motherly role and care for her mother. Her actions inspire Ella to form a group of women to exorcise Beloved from the community, and she describes, “For Sethe it was as though the Clearing had come to her with all its heat and simmering leaves, where the voices of women searched for the right combination, the key the code, the sound that broke the back of words. Building voice upon voice until they found it, and when they did it was a wave of sound wide enough to sound deep water and knock the pods off chestnut trees. It broke over Sethe and she trembled like the baptized in its wash” (308). Morrison refers back to the image of the Clearing to highlight how Denver has assumed the positive role of Baby Suggs in the community, supporting and inspiring the people of the community to work towards the greater good. Morrison then compares the voices of the praying woman to a wave of sound that could even “knock the pods off chestnut trees,” highlighting the complete extent of power a united community truly holds. In the wake of this spiritually pure experience, Sethe “tremble[s] like the baptized,” showcasing how she has been, to some extent, cleansed of the taint of Beloved by Denver&#x27;s courageous actions.

Through her characterization of both Sethe and Denver as unlikely heroes capable of surpassing adversities in order to help their loved ones escape the haunting of their past, Morrison may be emphasizing that heroism is defined not by supernatural powers or acts of unparalleled valor, but by the courageous intent to overcome the assertive preconceptions of society in order to ensure the greater good and positively influence on others in the process. As her experience in slavery came to define her life as a free woman, Sethe wallowed in her past, becoming a hero only when she allowed those she loved to escape their own burdens from the de-humanizing effects of slavery. Denver, on the other hand, breaks free of her past isolation in order to help Sethe seek a future beyond the constraints of her past. Morrison highlights that individuals have the ability to act with heroism, choosing to bring others out of the desolation of their past burden. Such a phenomenon can be enacted in current society by resisting the ideals of society, but rather, standing up for own beliefs to find heroism in the face of great opposition.

== Major characters ==

=== Sethe ===
Sethe is the protagonist of the novel. She escaped slavery from a plantation called Sweet Home. She lives in the house named 124 (a house on 124 Bluestone Rd., but referred to only as &quot;124&quot;) which is believed to be haunted because she killed her infant child there. Her two sons have fled because of the haunting, and she resides in the house with her daughter Denver. She is motherly and will do anything to protect her children from suffering the same abuses she experienced when she was enslaved. She is greatly influenced by her repression of the trauma she endured. She lives with &quot;a tree on her back&quot;, scars from being whipped. Her character is resilient, yet defined by her traumatic past. She was 19 years old when Denver was born, making her birth year to be 1836.

=== Beloved ===
The opaque understanding of Beloved is central to the novel. She is a young woman who mysteriously appears from a body of water near Sethe&#x27;s house, and is discovered soaking wet on the doorstep by Sethe, Paul D, and Denver, on their return from visiting the fair; they take her in. She is widely believed to be the murdered baby who haunted 124, as the haunting ends when she arrives, and in many ways she behaves like a child. As also mentioned, a young woman enslaved by a White man nearby had escaped, and Beloved recounts stories of past slaves, including Sethe&#x27;s mother. Morrison stated that the character Beloved is the daughter Sethe killed. The murdered baby was unnamed, so her name is derived from the engraving on Sethe&#x27;s murdered baby&#x27;s tombstone, which simply read &quot;Beloved&quot; because Sethe could not afford to engrave the word &quot;Dearly&quot; or anything else. Beloved becomes a catalyst to bring repressed trauma of the family to the surface, but also creates madness in the house and slowly depletes Sethe.

=== Paul D ===
Paul D retains his slave name; most of the enslaved men at Sweet Home were named Paul. He also retains many painful memories from enslavement and being forced to live in a chain gang; he had been moving around continuously before arriving at 124. He has a &quot;tobacco tin&quot; for a heart, in which he contains his painful memories, until Beloved opens it. Years after their time together at Sweet Home, Paul D and Sethe reunite and begin a romantic relationship. He acts fatherly towards Denver and is the first to be suspicious of Beloved. Despite their long past, he fails to understand Sethe fully because of her motherhood and because of the many years that had passed since.

=== Denver ===
Denver is Sethe&#x27;s only child who remains at 124. Isolated from her community after Beloved&#x27;s killing, Denver forms a close bond with her mother. Upon Beloved&#x27;s arrival, Denver watches as her sister&#x27;s ghost begins to exhibit demonic activity. Although introduced as a childish character, Denver develops into a protective woman throughout the novel. In the final chapters, Denver fights not only for her personal independence, but also for her mother&#x27;s wellbeing, breaking the cycle of isolation at 124. She is 18 years old at the beginning of the novel.

=== Baby Suggs ===
Baby Suggs is Sethe&#x27;s mother-in-law. Her son Halle worked to buy her freedom, after which she travels to Cincinnati and establishes herself as a respected leader in the community, preaching for the Black people to love themselves because other people will not. This respect turns sour after she turns some food into a feast, earning their envy, as well as Sethe&#x27;s act of infanticide. Baby Suggs retires to her bed, where she thinks about pretty colors for the rest of her life. She dies at 70 in the beginning of the book, 8 years before the main events.

=== Halle ===
Halle is the son of Baby Suggs, the husband of Sethe and father of her children. Sethe and he were married in Sweet Home, yet they got separated during her escape. He is only mentioned in flashbacks. Paul D was the last to see Halle, churning butter at Sweet Home. He is presumed to have gone mad after seeing residents of Sweet Home violating Sethe. He is hardworking and good, qualities that Paul D sees in Denver at the end of the book, but ones that Baby Suggs fears make him a target.

=== Schoolteacher ===
Schoolteacher is the primary discipliner, violent, abusive, and cruel to the people he enslaved at Sweet Home, whom he views as animals. He comes for Sethe following her escape, but she kills her daughter and is arrested, instead.

=== Amy Denver ===
Amy Denver is a young white girl who finds Sethe desperately trying to make her way to safety after her escape from Sweet Home, trying to get to Boston herself. Sethe is extremely pregnant at the time, and her feet are bleeding badly from the travel. Amy helps nurture her and deliver Sethe&#x27;s daughter on a small boat, and Sethe names the child Denver after her.

==Adaptations==
In 1998, the novel was made into a film directed by Jonathan Demme, and produced by and starring Oprah Winfrey.

In January 2016, &quot;Beloved&quot; was broadcast in 10 episodes by BBC Radio 4 as part of its &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; programme. The radio series was adapted by Patricia Cumper.

==Legacy==
&quot;Beloved&quot; received the Frederic G. Melcher Book Award, which is named for an editor of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;. In accepting the award on October 12, 1988, Morrison said that &quot;[t]here is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby&quot; honoring the memory of the human beings forced into slavery and brought to the United States. &quot;There&#x27;s no small bench by the road,&quot; she continued. &quot;And because such a place doesn&#x27;t exist (that I know of), the book had to.&quot; Inspired by her remarks, the Toni Morrison Society began to install benches at significant sites in the history of slavery in America. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the first &#x27;bench by the road&#x27; was dedicated on July 26, 2008, on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina, the place of entry for some 40% of the enslaved Africans brought to the United States. Morrison said she was extremely moved by the memorial. In 2017, the 21st bench was placed at the Library of Congress. It is dedicated to Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852–1925), the first African-American assistant librarian of Congress.

The novel received the seventh annual Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award in 1988, given to a novelist who &quot;most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy&#x27;s purposes—his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.&quot;

===Critical reception===
The publication of &quot;Beloved&quot; in 1987 resulted in the greatest acclaim yet for Morrison. Although nominated for the National Book Award, it did not win, and 48 African-American writers and critics—including Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez, Angela Davis, Ernest J. Gaines, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Rosa Guy, June Jordan, Paule Marshall, Louise Meriwether, Eugene Redmond, Sonia Sanchez, Quincy Troupe, John Edgar Wideman, and John A. Williams—signed a letter of protest that was published in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; on January 24, 1988. Yet, later in 1988, &quot;Beloved&quot; did receive the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, as well as the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award, the Melcher Book Award, the Lyndhurst Foundation Award, and the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award.

Commentators have described &quot;Beloved&quot; as an exploration of notions of family, trauma, the repression of memory, the restoration of the historical record and an attempt to give voice to the collective memory of African Americans. Indeed, critics and Morrison herself have indicated that the controversial epigraph to &quot;Beloved&quot;, &quot;60 million and more&quot;, is drawn from a number of studies on the African slave trade, which estimate that approximately half of each ship&#x27;s &quot;cargo&quot; perished in transit to America.

Scholars have additionally debated the nature of the character Beloved, arguing whether she is actually a ghost or a real person. Reviewers, assuming Beloved to be a supernatural incarnation of Sethe&#x27;s daughter, have faulted &quot;Beloved&quot; as a confusing ghost story; Elizabeth B. House, however, has argued that Beloved is not a ghost, and the novel is actually a story of two probable instances of mistaken identity. Beloved is haunted by the loss of her African parents, and thus comes to believe that Sethe is her mother. Sethe longs for her dead daughter and is rather easily convinced that Beloved is the child she has lost. Such an interpretation, House contends, clears up many puzzling aspects of the novel and emphasizes Morrison&#x27;s concern with familial ties.

Since the late 1970s, the focus on Morrison&#x27;s representation of African-American experience and history has been strong. The idea that writing acts as a means of healing or recovery is a strain in many of these studies. Timothy Powell, for instance, argues that Morrison&#x27;s recovery of a Black logos rewrites blackness as &quot;affirmation, presence, and good&quot;, while Theodore O. Mason Jr. suggests that Morrison&#x27;s stories unite communities.

Many critics explore memory, or what &quot;Beloved&quot;’s Sethe calls &quot;rememory&quot;, in this light. Susan Bowers places Morrison in a &quot;long tradition of African American apocalyptic writing&quot; that looks back in time, &quot;unveiling&quot; the horrors of the past in order to &quot;transform&quot; them. Several critics have interpreted Morrison&#x27;s representations of trauma and memory through a psychoanalytic framework. Ashraf H. A. Rushdy explores how primal scenes in Morrison&#x27;s novels are &quot;an opportunity and affective agency for self-discovery through memory&quot; and &quot;rememory&quot;. As Jill Matus argues, however, Morrison&#x27;s representations of trauma are &quot;never simply curative&quot;: in raising the ghosts of the past to banish or memorialize them, the texts potentially &quot;provoke readers to the vicarious experience of trauma and act as a means of transmission&quot;.
Ann Snitow&#x27;s reaction to &quot;Beloved&quot; neatly illustrates how Morrison criticism began to evolve and move toward new modes of interpretation. In her 1987 review of &quot;Beloved&quot;, Snitow argues that Beloved, the ghost at the center of the narrative, is &quot;too light&quot; and &quot;hollow&quot;, rendering the entire novel &quot;airless&quot;. Snitow changed her position after reading criticism that interpreted &quot;Beloved&quot; in a different way, seeing something more complicated and burdened than a literal ghost, something requiring different forms of creative expression and critical interpretation. The conflicts at work here are ideological, as well as critical; they concern the definition and evaluation of American and African-American literature, the relationship between art and politics, and the tension between recognition and appropriation.

In defining Morrison&#x27;s texts as African-American literature, critics have become more attentive to historical and social context and to the way Morrison&#x27;s fiction engages with specific places and moments in time. As Jennings observes, many of Morrison&#x27;s novels are set in isolated Black communities where African practices and belief systems are not marginalized by a dominant White culture, but rather remain active, if perhaps subconscious, forces shaping the community. Matus comments that Morrison&#x27;s later novels &quot;have been even more thoroughly focused on specific historical moments&quot;; &quot;through their engagement with the history of slavery and early twentieth-century Harlem, [they] have imagined and memorialized aspects of black history that have been forgotten or inadequately remembered&quot;.

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Beloved&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

===Banning and controversy===
&quot;Beloved&quot; has been banned in many U.S. schools, including at least eleven during the 2021–2022 academic year. Common reasons for censorship include bestiality, infanticide, sex, and violence.

In 2007, twenty years after its 1987 publication, the novel was abruptly abandoned by an AP English class at Eastern High School in Louisville, Kentucky, at the order of the school&#x27;s principal. The class had nearly reached the end of the book when a parent complained about language on page 13. Upon being informed that the book was being immediately banned, the English teacher who was teaching the book argued to the school&#x27;s Site Based Decision Making Council that a college-level English literature course should be taught. With the help of like-minded teachers and an outpouring from Eastern&#x27;s alumni, the ban was soon lifted, and the book continues to be taught at the high school today.

In Virginia, &quot;Beloved&quot; was considered for removal from the Fairfax County senior English reading list due to a parent&#x27;s 2017 complaint that &quot;the book includes scenes of violent sex, including a gang rape, and was too graphic and extreme for teenagers&quot;. Parental concern about &quot;Beloved&quot;″s content inspired the &quot;Beloved Bill&quot;, legislation that would have required Virginia public schools to notify parents of any &quot;sexually explicit content&quot; and provide an alternative assignment if requested. The bill was vetoed by Governor Terry McAuliffe. When McAuliffe ran again for the governor&#x27;s office in 2021, a major event in the election was his statement during a debate that, &quot;Yeah, I stopped the bill that—I don&#x27;t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.&quot; His opponent, Glenn Youngkin, seized on the remark, and produced a television commercial in which a parent recounted her effort to get the book banned. The commercial did not mention the title, author, or subject of the book, but focused on the &quot;explicit material&quot; in the unnamed work.

Student activist group Voters of Tomorrow announced plans in February 2022 to distribute banned books to students in Texas and Virginia, including &quot;Beloved&quot;. Parents in the Katy Independent School District responded to the book distributions by filing a request to review &quot;Beloved&quot;, resulting in the book&#x27;s removal from school libraries and restriction to 11th and 12th Grade students. Students and parents spoke against banning the book during the public forum segment of the district&#x27;s board meetings. The ACLU of Texas delivered a letter to school board members and the superintendent in April 2022 claiming that the district&#x27;s book removal of &quot;Beloved&quot; and other titles violated the First Amendment, the Texas Constitution, and the district&#x27;s own policies.

===Trilogy===
&quot;Beloved&quot; is the first of three novels about love and African-American history, sometimes called the &quot;Beloved&quot; Trilogy. Morrison said they are intended to be read together, explaining: &quot;The conceptual connection is the search for the beloved – the part of the self that is you, and loves you, and is always there for you.&quot; The second novel in the trilogy, &quot;Jazz&quot;, came out in 1992. The third novel &quot;Paradise&quot;, about citizens of an all-Black town, came out in 1997.

<doc id="1268728" wikidata="Q1095325" url="?curid=1268728" title="Clara Birnberg">
<text>Clara Birnberg (1892 or 1894–1989) was a British artist, illustrator, portraitist and sculptor. After her marriage to the artist Stephen Weinstein, they changed their surname to Winsten (with her becoming Clare Winsten) and both became Quaker humanists.

==Biography==
Birnberg, whose father was born in Ternopil in modern Ukraine, moved to England with her family in 1902. Studying at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1910 and 1912 with Isaac Rosenberg and David Bomberg, Birnberg became the only female member of their &#x27;Whitechapel Boys&#x27; circle of artists and poets, and was the only female exhibitor at the 1914 post-Impressionist exhibition &quot;Twentieth Century Art: A Review of Modern Movements&quot; at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in which this circle played a major part.

Among her sculptures are one in the Toynbee Hall in Whitechapel, and one of Joan of Arc in the garden of George Bernard Shaw’s house in Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire, where Shaw and the Winstens were neighbours (Stephen already had connections with Shaw). Clare illustrated Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Buoyant Billions: A Comedy of No Manners in Prose&quot; (1949), and the posthumously published &quot;My Dear Dorothea: A practical system of Moral education for females Embodied in a letter to a young person Of that sex&quot; (1956), written when he was 21. In addition to painting Shaw a number of times, Birnberg also produced a 1946 bronze sculpture of him, which passed on his death to the Shaw Theatre and then (on its closure) to the Mayor of Camden. The British Museum also has a bronze bust of Shaw by her. She also made drawings of Shaw, as well as of Dmitri Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten and Mahatma Gandhi.

Her daughter Ruth Harrison was known as a campaigner for animal welfare. Ruth married Dexter Harrison, a London architect.

<doc id="1268730" wikidata="Q1234581" url="?curid=1268730" title="Igorot people">
<text>The indigenous peoples of the Cordillera in northern Luzon, Philippines, often referred to by the exonym Igorot people, or more recently, as the Cordilleran peoples, are an ethnic group composed of nine main ethnolinguistic groups whose domains are in the Cordillera Mountain Range, altogether numbering about 1.8 million people in the early 21st century.

Their languages belong to the northern Luzon subgroup of Philippine languages, which in turn belongs to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.

These ethnic groups keep or have kept until recently their traditional religion and way of life. Some live in the tropical forests of the foothills, but most live in rugged grassland and pine forest zones higher up.

== Etymology ==
From the root word &quot;golot&quot;, which means &quot;mountain,&quot; &quot;Igolot&quot; means &quot;people from the mountains&quot;, a reference to any of various ethnic groups in the mountains of northern Luzon. During the Spanish colonial era, the term was variously recorded as &quot;Igolot&quot;, &quot;Ygolot&quot;, and &quot;Igorrote&quot;, compliant to Spanish orthography.

The endonyms Ifugao or Ipugaw (also meaning &quot;mountain people&quot;) are used more frequently by the Igorots themselves, as &quot;igorot&quot; is viewed by some as slightly pejorative, except by the Ibaloys. The Spanish borrowed the term &quot;Ifugao&quot; from the lowland Gaddang and Ibanag groups.

== Cordillera ethnolinguistic groups ==

The Igorots may be roughly divided into two general subgroups: the larger group lives in the south, central and western areas, and is very adept at rice-terrace farming; the smaller group lives in the east and north. Prior to Spanish colonisation of the islands, the peoples now included under the term did not consider themselves as belonging to a single, cohesive ethnic group.

=== Bontoc ===
The Bontok ethnolinguistic group can be found in the central and east portions of the Mountain Province. It mainly consists of the Balangaos and Gaddangs, with a significant portion who identify as part of the Kalinga group. The Bontok live in a mountainous territory, particularly close to the Chico River and its tributaries. Mineral resources (gold, copper, limestone, gypsum) can be found in the mountain areas. Gold, in particular, has been traditionally extracted from the Bontoc municipality. 

The Chico River provides sand, gravel, and white clay, while the forests of Barlig and Sadanga within the area have rattan, bamboo and pine trees. They are the second largest group in the Mountain Province. The Bontoc live on the banks of the Chico River. They speak Bontoc and Ilocano. They formerly practiced head-hunting and had distinctive body tattoos. The Bontoc describe three types of tattoos: The &quot;chak-lag′&quot;, the tattooed chest of the head taker; &quot;pong′-o&quot;, the tattooed arms of men and women; and &quot;fa′-tĕk&quot;, for all other tattoos of both sexes. Women were tattooed on the arms only.

=== Ibaloi ===
The Ibaloi (also Ibaloy, Ibaluy, Nabaloi, Inavidoy, Inibaloi, Ivadoy) and Kalanguya (also Kallahan and Ikalahan) are one of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines who live mostly in the southern part of Benguet, located in the Cordillera of northern Luzon, the eastern part of La Union of Ilocos Region and Nueva Vizcaya in the Cagayan Valley region with a population of 209,338 as of 2020. They were traditionally an agrarian society. Many of the Ibaloi and Kalanguya people continue with their agriculture and rice cultivation.

Their native language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages family and is closely related to the Pangasinan language, primarily spoken in the province of Pangasinan, located southwest of Benguet.

Baguio, the major city of the Cordillera, dubbed the &quot;Summer Capital of the Philippines,&quot; is located in southern Benguet. 

The largest feast of the Ibaloi is the &quot;Peshit or Pedit&quot;, a public feast mainly sponsored by people of prestige and wealth. &quot;Peshit&quot; can last for weeks and involves the killing and sacrifice of dozens of animals.

One of the more popular dances of the Ibaloi is the &quot;bendian&quot;, a mass dance participated in by hundreds of male and female dancers. Originally a victory dance in time of war, it evolved into a celebratory dance. It is used as entertainment (&quot;ad-adivay&quot;) in the cañao feasts, hosted by the wealthy class (&quot;baknang&quot;).

=== Ifugao ===
Ifugao women in traditional attire, wearing ampuyo (skirt), lamma (blouse), and ginuttu (belt).Ifugaos are the people inhabiting Ifugao province. They come from the municipalities of Lagawe (Capital Town), Aguinaldo, Alfonso Lista, Asipulo, Banaue, Hingyon, Hungduan, Kiangan, Lamut, Mayoyao, and Tinoc. The province is one of the smallest provinces in the Philippines with an area of only 251,778 hectares, or about 0.8% of the total Philippine land area. It has a temperate climate and is rich in mineral and forest products.

The term &quot;Ifugao&quot; is derived from &quot;ipugo&quot; which means &quot;earth people&quot;, &quot;mortals&quot; or &quot;humans&quot;, as distinguished from spirits and deities. It also means &quot;from the hill&quot;, as &quot;pugo&quot; means hill. The term &quot;Igorot&quot; or &quot;Ygolote&quot; was the term used by the Spanish colonial officials for mountain people. The Ifugaos, however, prefer the name &quot;Ifugao&quot;.
As of 1995, the population of the Ifugaos was counted to be 131,635. Although the majority of them are still in Ifugao province, some of them already transferred to Baguio, where they worked as woodcarvers, and to other parts of the Cordillera region. They are divided into subgroups based on the differences in dialects, traditions, and design/color of costumes. The main subgroups are Ayangan, Kalangaya, and Tuwali. 

Furthermore, the Ifugao society is divided into three social classes: the &quot;kadangyans&quot; or the aristocrats, the &quot;tagus&quot; or the middle class, and the &quot;nawotwots&quot; or the poor ones. The &quot;kadangyans&quot; sponsor the prestige rituals called &quot;hagabi&quot; and &quot;uyauy&quot; and this separates them from the &quot;tagus&quot; who cannot sponsor feasts but are economically well off. The &quot;nawotwots&quot; are those who have limited land properties and are usually hired by the upper classes to do work in the fields and other services.

=== Kalanguya (Ikalahan) ===

The Kalanguya or Ikalahan people are a small group distributed amongst the mountain ranges of Sierra Madre, the Caraballo Mountains, and the eastern part of the Cordillera mountain range. The main population resides in the Nueva Vizcaya province, with Kayapa as the center. They are considered to be part of the Igorot (mountain people) but distinguish themselves with the name Ikalahan, the name taken from the forest trees that grow in the Caraballo Mountain.

They are among the least studied ethnic groups, thus their early history is unknown. However, Felix M. Keesing suggests that, like other groups in the mountains, they fled from the lowlands to escape Spanish persecution.

===Isinai===
The Isinai/Isinay are a small ethnic group living in the Cagayan Valley, specifically in the municipalities of Bambang, Dupax del Sur, Aritao in Nueva Vizcaya, as well as around Quirino province, and in the northern areas of Nueva Ecija and Aurora. Their ethnic communities show a decline in population, with only around 12,600 members on record. They speak the Isinai language (also spelled Isinay), which is a Northern Luzon language primarily spoken in Nueva Vizcaya province in the northern Philippines. By linguistic classification, it is more divergent from other South-Central Cordilleran languages, such as Kalinga, Itneg or Ifugao and Kankanaey.

=== Isneg ===
The Isnag, also Isneg or Apayao, live at the northwesterly end of northern Luzon, in the upper half of the Cordillera province of Apayao. The term &quot;Isneg&quot; derives from &quot;itneg&quot;, meaning inhabitants of the Tineg River. Apayao derives from the battle cry &quot;Ma-ap-ay-ao&quot; as their hand is clapped rapidly over their mouth. They may also refer to themselves as &quot;Imandaya&quot; if they live upstream, or &quot;Imallod&quot; if they live downstream. The municipalities in the Isneg domain include Pudtol, Kabugao, Calanasan, Flora, Conner, Sta. Marcela, and Luna. Isnag populations also live in the eastern area of the province of Ilocos Norte, specifically the municipalities of Adams, Carasi, Marcos, Dingras, Vintar, Dumalneg and Solsona; and in the Northwestern part of the province of Cagayan, specifically the municipalities of Santa Praxedes, Claveria, Pamplona and Sanchez Mira. Two major river systems, the Abulog River and the Apayao River, run through Isnag country.

Jars of basi are half-buried in the ground within a small shed, &quot;abulor&quot;, constructed of 4 posts and a shed. This &quot;abulor&quot; is found within the open space, &quot;linong&quot; or &quot;sidong&quot;, below their houses (&quot;balay&quot;). They grow upland rice, while also practicing swidden farming and fishing.

&quot;Say-am&quot; was an important ceremony after a successful headhunting, or other important occasions, hosted by the wealthy, and lasting one to five days or more. Dancing, singing, eating, and drinking mark the feast, and Isnegs wear their finest clothes. The shaman, &quot;Anituwan&quot;, prays to the spirit Gatan, before the first dog is sacrificed, if a human head had not been taken, and offered at the sacred tree, &quot;ammadingan&quot;. On the last day, a coconut is split in honor of the headhunter guardian, Anglabbang.The &quot;Pildap&quot; is an equivalent &quot;say-am&quot; but hosted by the poor. Conversion to Christianity grew after 1920, and today, the Isnegs are divided in their religious beliefs, with some still being animistic.

=== Itneg (Tinguian) ===
Otherwise known as Itineg, meaning &quot;people living near the Tineg River&quot; (exonyms: Tinguian, Tinguianes, Itinek, Mandaya, Tingian), they live in the mountainous area of Abra and Ilocos Sur in northwestern Luzon who descended from immigrants from Kalinga, Apayao, and the Northern Kankana-ey; they also live in Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte. They refer to themselves as &quot;Itneg&quot;, though the Spaniards called them &quot;Tingguian&quot; when they came to the Philippines because they are mountain dwellers. 

As of 2020, The total population of the Itnegs are 100,806. The Tingguians are further divided into 11 distinct subgroups which are the Adasen, Balatok, Banao, Belwang, Binongan, Gobang, Inlaud, Mabaka, Maeng, Masadiit and Moyadan. Wealth and material possessions (such as Chinese jars, copper gongs called &quot;gangsa&quot;, beads, rice fields, and livestock) determine the social standing of a family or person, as well as the hosting of feasts and ceremonies. Despite the divide of social status, there is no sharp distinction between rich (&quot;baknang&quot;) and poor. Wealth is inherited but the society is open for social mobility of the citizens by virtue of hard work. Medium are the only distinct group in their society, but even then it is only during ceremonial periods.

===Ilongot===
The Ilongot (or Ibilao) are a tribe who inhabit the southern Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountains, on the east side of Luzon in the Philippines, primarily in the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija and along the mountain border between the provinces of Quirino and Aurora. An alternative name of this tribe and its language is &quot;Bugkalot&quot;. They are known as a tribe of headhunters.
Presently, there are about 87,000 Ilongots. The Ilongots tend to inhabit areas close to rivers, as they provide a food source and a means for transportation. Their native language is the Ilongot language, currently spoken by about 50,000 people. They also speak the Ilocano &amp; Tagalog languages, the latter is spoken in Nueva Ecija &amp; Aurora as much as Ilocano.

=== Kalinga ===
The Kalingas are mainly found in Kalinga province which has an area of 3,282.58 sq.km. Some of them, however, already migrated to Mountain Province, Apayao, Cagayan, and Abra. As of 2020, they were counted to be 212,983, not including those who have migrated outside the Cordillera region.Kalinga territory includes floodplains of Tabuk, and Rizal, plus the Chico River. Gold and copper deposits are common in Pasil and Balbalan. Tabuk was settled in the 12th century, and from there other Kalinga settlements spread, practicing wet rice (&quot;papayaw&quot;) and swidden (&quot;uwa&quot;) cultivation. Kalinga houses (&quot;furoy&quot;, &quot;buloy&quot;, &quot;fuloy&quot;, &quot;phoyoy&quot;, &quot;biloy&quot;) are either octagonal for the wealthy, or square, and are elevated on posts (a few as high as 20–30 feet), with a single room. Other buildings include granaries (&quot;alang&quot;) and field sheds (&quot;sigay&quot;).
The name &quot;Kalinga&quot; came from the Ibanag and Gaddang term &quot;kalinga&quot;, which means &quot;headhunter&quot;. Edward Dozier divided Kalinga geographically into three sub-cultures and geographical position: Balbalan (north); Pasil, Lubuagan, and Tinglayan (south); and Tanudan (east). Teodoro Llamzon divided the Kalinga based on their dialects: Guinaang, Lubuagan, Punukpuk, Tabuk, Tinglayan, and Tanudan.

=== Kankanaey ===
The Kankanaey people (&quot;Kankanai&quot; or &quot;Kankana-ey&quot;) are native to Western Mountain Province, northern Benguet, northeastern La Union, and southeastern Ilocos Sur, with a population of 466,970 as of 2020. The Kankanaey have two distinct sub-groups: the Northern Kankanaey, or Applai, who live in Sagada and Besao in western Mountain Province and constitute a linguistic group, and the Southern Kankanaey, who live in the mountainous regions of Mountain Province and Benguet, specifically in the municipalities of Tadian, Bauko, Sabangan, Bakun, Kibungan, Buguias, and Mankayan.

Kankanaey houses include the two-story &quot;innagamang&quot;, the larger &quot;binangi&quot;, the cheaper &quot;tinokbob&quot;, and the elevated &quot;tinabla&quot;. Their granaries (&quot;agamang&quot;) are elevated to avoid rats. Two other institutions of the Kankanaey of Mountain Province are the &quot;dap-ay&quot;, or the men&#x27;s dormitory and civic center, and the &quot;ebgan&quot;, or the girls&#x27; dormitory.

Kankanaey&#x27;s major dances include &quot;tayaw&quot;, &quot;pat-tong&quot;, &quot;takik&quot; (a wedding dance), and &quot;balangbang&quot;. The &quot;tayaw&quot; is a community dance that is usually done in weddings it maybe also danced by the Ibaloi but has a different style. &quot;Pattong&quot;, also a community dance from Mountain Province which every municipality has its own style, while &quot;Balangbang&quot; is the dance&#x27;s modern term. There are also some other dances like the &quot;sakkuting&quot;, &quot;pinanyuan&quot; (another wedding dance) and &quot;bogi-bogi&quot; (courtship dance).

Different Igorot groups speak the Ilocano language as a lingua franca for better communication amongst their people because many Cordilleran languages have varying dialect continuums through different tribes and different localities. They also utilize the Ilocano language to communicate with ethnic Ilocanos and other non-Ilocano second-language speakers such as the Ibanags. Along with Ilocano, they also speak Tagalog and English as lingua francas.

== Igorot diaspora ==
There are Igorot minorities outside their homeland. Outside the Cordillera Administrative Region, they reside in neighboring provinces of Ilocos region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon (particularly Nueva Ecija &amp; Aurora), Metro Manila and Calabarzon, (where Igorot Village is located in Cainta, Rizal) and Bicol Region.

In Visayas, Igorots also form minority communities in Aklan, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Cebu, Siquijor, Bohol, Biliran and Leyte.

Igorots are also found as a minority in several areas Mindanao, setting communities in Agusan del Norte, Tagum City, Davao City, Digos City (Igorot Village is also found in the mountainous area in the city), few other parts of Davao del Sur, Davao de Oro, North Cotabato, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Lanao del Norte and Bukidnon. Most of them are soldiers, policemen and government officials who are temporarily deployed in the area, but many have settled permanently as civilians retired from their posts and intermarried with the Mindanaoans of various ethnicities. There is an organization for Igorot residents of Mindanao.

Igorots can also be found in other countries, mostly as overseas workers.

== History ==

=== Spanish colonial era ===
The gold found in the land of the Igorot was an attraction for the Spanish. Originally gold was exchanged at Pangasinan by the Igorot. The gold was used to buy consumable products by the Igorot. Both gold and desire to Christianize the Igorot were given as reasons for Spanish conquest. In 1572 the Spanish started hunting for the gold. Benguet Province was entered by the Spanish with the intention of obtaining gold. The fact that the Igorots managed to stay out of Spanish dominion vexed the Spaniards. The gold evaded the hands of the Spaniards due to Igorot opposition. The Igorot would also be used as mercenaries and scouts during the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine-American War.

=== American colonial era ===
Samuel E. Kane wrote about his life amongst the Bontoc, Ifugao, and Kalinga after the Philippine–American War in his book &quot;Thirty Years with the Philippine Head-Hunters&quot; (1933). The first American school for Igorot girls was opened in Baguio in 1901 by Alice McKay Kelly. Kane argued that Dean C. Worcester &quot;did more than any one man to stop head-hunting and to bring the traditional enemy tribes together in friendship.&quot; Kane wrote of the Igorot people, &quot;there is a peace, a rhythm and an elemental strength in the life...which all the comforts and refinements of civilization can not replace...fifty years hence...there will be little left to remind the young Igorots of the days when the drums and &quot;ganzas&quot; of the head-hunting &quot;canyaos&quot; resounded throughout the land.

In 1903, missionary bishop Charles Brent traveled through northern Luzon, in hopes of directing missionary efforts to convert the pagan Igorot populace. A mission church was established for the Bontoc tribe of the Igorots in the Bontoc, Mountain Province. The Bontoc missionaries wrote the first Igorot grammars, which were published by the government.

In 1904, a group of Igorot people were brought to St. Louis, Missouri, United States, for the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. They constructed the Igorot Village in the Philippine Exposition section of the fair, which became one of the most popular exhibits. The poet T. S. Eliot, who was born and raised in St. Louis, visited and explored the Village. Inspired by their tribal dance and others, he wrote the short story, &quot;The Man Who Was King&quot; (1905). In 1905, 50 tribespeople were on display at a Brooklyn, New York, amusement park for the summer, ending in the custody of the unscrupulous Truman Hunt, a showman &quot;on the run across America with the tribe in tow.&quot;

On February 12, 1912, a Mountain Province Igorot chief named Gagaban became the first Filipino to fly in an airplane, riding as a passenger in a biplane called the &quot;Red Devil&quot; with Lee Hammond as the pilot.

=== World War II ===

During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, Igorots fought against Japan. Donald Blackburn&#x27;s World War II guerrilla force had a strong core of Igorots. A young Igorot woman, Naomi Flores, was an important member of the Miss U Spy Ring. General Tomoyuki Yamashita surrendered to Filipino and American forces in Kiangan, Ifugao in early September 1945; a shrine was built in the town commemorating his surrender.

=== Postwar era ===
On June 18, 1966, &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot; was enacted to split Mountain Province and create four separate and independent provinces namely Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga-Apayao, and Mountain Province. Ifugao and Kalinga-Apayao were placed under the jurisdiction of the Cagayan Valley region, with Benguet and Mountain Province placed under the Ilocos Region.

==== Martial law ====

After the declaration of martial law by Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, the region became the focus of militarization as a result of local objections to the government&#x27;s push for the Chico River Dam Project near Sadanga, Mountain Province, and Tinglayan, Kalinga. Frustrated by the project delays caused by the opposition, Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree no. 848 in December 1975, constituting the municipalities of Lubuagan, Tinglayan, Tanudan, and Pasil into a &quot;Kalinga Special Development Region&quot; (KSDR), in an effort to neutralize opposition to the Chico IV dam.

Empowered by martial law to conduct warrantless arrests, the 60th PC Brigade had arrested at least 150 locals by April 1977, accusing them of supposed subversion and of obstructing government projects, and various other offenses such as boycotting the October 1976 constitutional referendum. Individuals arrested included tribal &quot;papangat&quot; (leaders/elders), young couples, and in at least one case, a 12-year-old child. By December 1978, parts of the Chico IV area had been declared &quot;free fire zones&quot;, no-man&#x27;s-land areas where the army could freely fire on any animals or permit-less humans at will.

On April 24, 1980, Marcos-controlled military forces assassinated Macli-ing Dulag, a &quot;pangat&quot; (leader) of the Butbut tribe of Kalinga. The assassination became a watershed moment, marking the first time the mainstream Philippine press could be openly critical against Marcos and the military, and building up a sense of Igorot identity.

==== Mount Data Peace Accord ====
After the end of the Marcos administration due to the 1986 People Power Revolution, the succeeding government under President Corazon Aquino secured a ceasefire with the main indigenous armed group in the Cordilleras, the Cordillera People&#x27;s Liberation Army (CPLA) led by Conrado Balweg. The Aquino government made a &quot;sipat&quot; or indigenous treaty, which would be known as the Mount Data Peace Accord, with the CPLA on September 13, 1986, ending hostilities.

<text>How I Learned to Drive is a play written by American playwright Paula Vogel. The play premiered on March 16, 1997, Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre. Vogel received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. It was written and developed at the Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska, with Molly Smith as artistic director.

The story follows the strained, sexual relationship between Li&#x27;l Bit and her aunt&#x27;s husband, Uncle Peck, from her pre-adolescence through her teenage years into college and beyond. Using the metaphor of driving and the issues of pedophilia, incest, and misogyny, the play explores the ideas of control and manipulation.

== Plot synopsis ==
The play tells the story of a woman nicknamed Li&#x27;l Bit as she comes to terms with her sexually abusive relationship with her Uncle Peck throughout her adolescence. Aside from Li&#x27;l Bit and Uncle Peck, a Greek Chorus of three is on hand to play all of the other characters in their lives. The script is a memory play told largely out of chronological order, with the first scene taking place in 1969 in a parking lot in rural Maryland. Li&#x27;l Bit is 17 years old and sitting in Uncle Peck&#x27;s car. Peck unhooks her bra through her shirt, an act that Li&#x27;l Bit finds uncomfortable. Li&#x27;l Bit mentions she is graduating high school and going to a &quot;fancy college&quot; in the fall, while Uncle Peck continues to admire her body.

Li&#x27;l Bit breaks from this scene to describe her family to the audience. She explains her family&#x27;s penchant for handing out nicknames based on genitalia, which is why she was branded with the alias Li&#x27;l Bit for life. This includes her alcoholic mother, the &quot;titless wonder&quot;, her misogynistic grandfather &quot;Big Papa&quot;, her submissive grandmother, and her young Cousin BB (Blue Balls). A typical family dinner in 1969 has Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s family (played by the three Greek Chorus members) cracking jokes about how &quot;well-endowed&quot; she is. Peck is the only family member who supports Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s dreams of going to school. Frustrated, Li&#x27;l Bit leaves the dinner after Grandfather goes too far with his insults. Peck&#x27;s wife Mary (Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s maternal aunt) asks him to comfort Li&#x27;l Bit, indicating that she (Mary) is ignorant of his abuse.

Li&#x27;l Bit reveals that she eventually lost her scholarship and was expelled from college because of a drinking problem. She spent most of that year driving on highways, marveling at how well Peck had taught her to drive. She then has a memory of 1968, where Uncle Peck takes her to a fancy Eastern Shore restaurant as a reward for passing her driver&#x27;s test on the first try. Peck slyly orders oysters and martinis for Li&#x27;l Bit to consume, while the girl&#x27;s mother gives less than stellar advice on drinking alcohol. Li&#x27;l Bit and her mother both become increasingly drunk on martinis. Peck carries the drunk Li&#x27;l Bit to his car, where they discuss the nature of her relationship. Li&#x27;l Bit drunkenly kisses her uncle, but Peck refuses to go any further until she coherently says otherwise. Li&#x27;l Bit begins to question the appropriateness of her relationship with her Uncle.

The Teenage Greek Chorus member briefly takes over to introduce a memory that is not Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s. In a monologue, Uncle Peck gives the unseen Cousin BB a fishing lesson, where it is strongly implied that he uses this as a cover to molest the boy the same way he used driving to abuse Li&#x27;l Bit. Li&#x27;l Bit takes control once again to recount a conversation she had with her mother and grandmother about sex. Mother tries to be helpful in explaining topics such as orgasms and consent, while Grandmother wails that Li&#x27;l Bit is too young to know about sex and uses scare tactics to keep her from doing it until she is married. The adult Li&#x27;l Bit breaks the memory to explain that she went on to have a one-night stand with a high school senior when she was twenty-seven, experiencing the allure of young flesh that her uncle once felt. She then returns to the memory, which turns into an argument between Mother and the Grandparents. Unable to deal with that memory again, Li&#x27;l Bit changes the memory (as part of the driving metaphor, she likens this to changing stations on the radio) to when Uncle Peck first taught her how to start up a car. Showing that he does have genuine concern for Li&#x27;l Bit beyond her body, Peck gives reasonable advice on how to be safe on the road. Li&#x27;l Bit becomes confused as to how Peck could abuse her while still being helpful.

The next scene is a series of vignettes on Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s school days in 1966, where she faced ridicule and sexual harassment from the other students on account of her large breasts. A boy asks her to dance at a school sock hop, but Li&#x27;l Bit refuses, believing he just wants to see her breasts &quot;jiggle&quot; while she dances.

The scenes shifts to 1965, where Uncle Peck takes provocative &quot;pin-up&quot; photos of Li&#x27;l Bit. Aunt Mary takes the stage to defend her husband&#x27;s actions to the audience. She claims that he is a good man, and that it is all Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s fault for leading him on. She believes that her marriage can be saved as soon as her niece goes off to college.

On Christmas Day 1964, 13-year-old Li&#x27;l Bit helps Uncle Peck wash the dishes. Li&#x27;l Bit questions where Peck was during Thanksgiving, implying that he entered a rehab for his alcoholism. Peck reveals that drinking helped him deal with a hidden pain that no one, not even Aunt Mary, could fix. Li&#x27;l Bit offers to spend one day a week with Uncle Peck, so long as he never &quot;crosses a line&quot;. This is how the driving lessons begin.

The scene flashes forward to 1969, Li&#x27;l Bit&#x27;s freshman year of college. The Greek Chorus lists the letters and gifts that Peck sends her, with each note counting down how many days are left until her 18th birthday. Startled by how unhinged her uncle has become, Li&#x27;l Bit arranges a meeting in a Philadelphia hotel room on December 10, 1969. Li&#x27;l Bit yells at Uncle Peck for becoming so possessive, while he insists that his niece is the love of his life. Li&#x27;l Bit reveals that the years of trauma from Peck have finally caught up with her, leading to her not focusing in school and failing her courses. After he kneels and proposes to Li&#x27;l Bit, vowing to divorce Aunt Mary, Li&#x27;l Bit turns him down and cuts him out of her life for good. She never sees Peck again after she leaves the hotel room.

Li&#x27;l Bit returns to the present to explain what became of Peck after she left: He turned to alcohol after years of sobriety, leading to the loss of his job, his marriage, and his driver&#x27;s license. He went on to die after drunkenly falling down a flight of stairs in his basement. Li&#x27;l Bit reflects on why her uncle may have molested her, wondering if someone did it to him when he was a child.

Li&#x27;l Bit has one more memory to share: the summer of 1962. An 11-year-old Li&#x27;l Bit fights with her mother about going on a seven-hour car trip to the beach with Uncle Peck. Mother is wary of him, but finally relents, telling Li&#x27;l Bit that she holds her responsible for any misdeeds. Li&#x27;l Bit sits in the car with Uncle Peck, only she doesn&#x27;t speak her lines out loud. The Teenage Greek Chorus, acting as young Li&#x27;l Bit, does so. Peck molests his niece for the first time.

The script then returns to the present. Li&#x27;l Bit reflects on how she is ready to move on with her life, and that despite everything she has been through, she can thank her Uncle Peck for one thing: the freedom she feels when she drives. The final scene has Li&#x27;l Bit alone in her car, and as she adjusts her rear view mirror, she notices Uncle Peck in the back. After smiling at him, she steps on the gas pedal and drives away, finally leaving Peck in the past as she drives off to a new chapter of her life.

==Background==
Vogel wrote the play at the Perseverance Theatre, Alaska, where she was in residence. The theatre presented a first reading. Vogel was inspired by the novel &quot;Lolita&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov: &quot;...she was stunned to find herself sympathizing with the narrator, Humbert Humbert, who sexually molests an adolescent girl.&quot;

Vogel explained: &quot;...she intended the play &#x27;to get the audience to go along for a ride they wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily take, or don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re taking.&#x27;&quot;

== Productions ==
&quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; premiered Off-Broadway in a production by the Vineyard Theatre (Douglas Aibel, Artistic Director; Jon Nakagawa, Managing Director) on May 6, 1997, and closed on April 19, 1998, at the Century Center For The Performing Arts. The play was directed by Mark Brokaw, set design was by Narelle Sissons, costume design was by Jess Goldstein, lighting design was by Mark McCullough, and the original sound design was by David van Tieghem. The play had been presented by the Vineyard Theatre in February to April 1997. The Vineyard Theatre production, in association with Daryl Roth and Roy Gabay, moved to the Century Theatre in April 1997. The original cast:

* Li&#x27;l Bit played by Mary-Louise Parker

The play was produced at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in 1999, directed by Molly Smith.
A 1999 production at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles featured Molly Ringwald and Brian Kerwin.

In 2006 the play was produced by the T. Schreiber Studio and Theater in New York City. &quot;The L Magazine&quot; review commented: &quot;Vogel’s play is twisted, smart (drive: metaphors for control, anyone?) and ultimately tragic, though shrewdly staggered moments of levity and candor keep it from Lifetime lows.&quot; This critically acclaimed production was directed by Terry Schreiber and received 10 New York Innovative Theatre (NYIT) Award nominations. Trey Gibbons won the NYIT Award for Outstanding Actor in a Featured Role.

L.A. Theatre Works produced an audio performance of the play, starring Glenne Headly, Randall Arney, Joy Gregory, Paul Mercier, and Rondi Reed.

The play was produced in Spanish by DETUCH Company in various theaters in Santiago, Chile in 2008, with Alejandra Díaz Scharager (Lil&#x27; Bit), Víctor Montero (Uncle Peck), Gabriel Urzúa (Male Greek Chorus), Annie Murath (Female Greek Chorus) and Carolina Larenas (Teenage Greek Chorus), directed by Marco Espinoza Quezada. It was also produced at the Teatro auditorio de Miraflores in Lima, Peru, in 2013, with Li&#x27;l Bit renamed &quot;Rayita&quot; and played by Leticia Poirier and Uncle Peck renamed &quot;Tío Pico&quot; and played by Marcelo Rivera. Ebelin Ortiz directed.

In 2012 Second Stage Theatre produced the first professional production of the play in New York City since its premiere in 1997. The work was directed by Kate Whoriskey and starred Norbert Leo Butz as Uncle Peck and Elizabeth Reaser as Li&#x27;l Bit. The production opened February 13, 2012 and was favorably reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2012 University of Vermont&#x27;s Department of Theatre produced the play with Vogel attending and addressing a symposium on women writers. Natalie Battistone and Colby Morgan played the lead roles. The production was directed by Department of Theatre Chair Gregory Ramos.

In 2015, the play received its first professional London revival at Southwark Playhouse, starring Olivia Poulet as Li&#x27;l Bit and William Ellis as Peck, directed by Jack Sain, produced by D.E.M. Productions for Fools &amp; Kings Theatre, with set and costume design by Katharine Heath, lighting design by Ziggy Jacobs, and composition and sound design by Nathan Klein.

In June 2019 the play was performed in Singapore by Wag the Dog Theatre Ltd., with Victoria Mintey as L&#x27;il Bit and Sean Worrall as Uncle Peck. It was directed by Warren Baumgart, Jr.

The play was set to premiere on Broadway in previews on March 27, 2020, and officially on April 22 with Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse reprising their roles from the original off-Broadway production, with original director Mark Brokaw helming the production. However, in the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic and The Broadway League&#x27;s subsequent closure of all Broadway performances until June 7, 2020, the production was postponed indefinitely, with hopes to return the following season. In June 2021, it was announced that the production would begin previews on March 29, 2022, at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and officially open on April 19.

==Critical reception==
Jill Dolan, in her review in &quot;Theatre Journal&quot;, wrote of the original 1997 Off-Broadway production: &quot;Vogel’s choice to remember Li’l Bit and Peck’s relationship nonchronologically illustrates its complexity, and allows the playwright to build sympathy for a man who might otherwise be despised and dismissed as a child molester...Vogel builds the relationship in scenes sculpted with spare efficiency by Brokaw that crystallize moments of trust, disappointment, longing, and desire.&quot;

The &quot;CurtainUp&quot; reviewer of the original 1997 Off-Broadway production wrote: &quot;Ms. Vogel has achieved the seemingly impossible: A story about a disturbing subject, pedophilia, that is as funny--yes, really,--as it is disturbing. Li&#x27;l Bit (Mary-Louise Parker) and Uncle Peck (David Morse) are painted with the delicate brush strokes of a sumi painting, more subtle than sensational, and as unstereotypical a victim and victimizer as Lolita and Humbert Humbert (from Nabokov&#x27;s Lolita which the playwright credits as her inspiration)...Before I say one more word, this is one of the must-see events of the season...&quot;

The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reviewer wrote of the 1998 Center Stage production: &quot;The surprising gift Vogel has given her two main characters is that, instead of labeling them good and evil, or victim and criminal, she treats them both with respect.&quot;

Ben Brantley, in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the original 1997 production, wrote: &quot;The scrambled chronology, which suggests the ways memories attack by stealth and out of sequence, makes it harder for the audience to form conventional judgments. More surprisingly, it clarifies the patterns in the relationship between niece and uncle: of degrees of responsibility, feelings of guilt and shifts in power. Ms. Vogel is too intelligent to present this simply as a study in victim versus villain or to fail to acknowledge that what&#x27;s happening is, in some appalling way, a real love story.&quot; Brantley, in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the 2012 Second Stage production, wrote: 
&quot;It is a performance that captures Ms. Vogel&#x27;s remarkable, clear-eyed empathy in portraying the incalculable damage done by damaged people&quot;.

<text>The Wide Awakes were a youth organization and later a paramilitary organization cultivated by the Republican Party during the 1860 presidential election in the United States. Using popular social events, an ethos of competitive fraternity, and even promotional comic books, the organization introduced many to political participation and proclaimed itself as the newfound voice of younger voters. The structured militant Wide Awakes appealed to a generation which had been profoundly shaken by the partisan instability in the 1850s, and offered young northerners a much-needed political identity.

==Overview==
In February 1860, abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay spoke in Hartford, Connecticut. As five textile clerks led a torch-lit march through town after the speech, they successfully fought off an attack by Democratic Party members. Adopting the uniform of black capes that such torchbearers wore to protect themselves from dripping oil onto their clothing, local Republicans were spurred by the incident to form the Wide Awakes.

In early March 1860, Abraham Lincoln spoke in Hartford, Connecticut, against the spread of slavery and for the right of workers to strike. Five store clerks that belonged to the Wide Awakes decided to join a parade for Lincoln, who delighted in the torchlight escort back to his hotel provided for him after his speech. Over the ensuing weeks, the Lincoln campaign made plans to develop Wide Awakes throughout the country and to use them to spearhead large voter registration drives, since they knew that new and young voters tended to embrace similarly new and young parties.

Members of the Wide Awakes were described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;young men of character and energy, earnest in their Republican convictions and enthusiastic in prosecuting the canvass on which we have entered.&quot; In Chicago, on October 3, 1860, 10,000 Wide Awakes marched in a three-mile procession. The story on that rally occupied eight columns of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In Indiana, one historian reported:

1860 was the most colorful in the memory of the Hoosier electorate. &quot;Speeches, day and night, torch-light processions, and all kinds of noise and confusion are the go, with all parties,&quot; commented the &quot;independent&quot; &quot;Indianapolis Locomotive.&quot; Congressman Julian too was impressed by the &quot;contrivance and spectacular display&quot; which prevailed in the current canvass. Each party took unusual pains to mobilize its followers in disciplined political clubs, but the most remarkable of these were the Lincoln &quot;Rail Maulers&quot; and &quot;Wide Awakes,&quot; whose organizations extended throughout the state. Clad in gaudy uniforms the members of these quasi-military bands participated in all Republican demonstrations. The &quot;Wide Awakes&quot; in particular were well drilled and served as political police in escorting party speakers and in preserving order at public meetings. Party emulation made every political rally the occasion for carefully arranged parades through banner-bedecked streets, torchlight processions, elaborate floats and transparencies, blaring bands, and fireworks.

By the middle of the 1860 campaign, Republicans bragged that they had Wide Awake chapters in every county of every northern (free) state. On the day of Lincoln&#x27;s election as president, Wide Awakes had grown to 500,000 members. The group remained active for several decades.

==Rituals==
===Uniform and tactics===

The Wide Awakes were a marching club. Their uniform was a full robe or cape and a military style hat, both made of black, shiny fabric. They carried a torch six feet in length to which a large flaming pivoting whale-oil container was mounted. Some carried rail-splitter axes strapped to their backs. The axes and split rails symbolized Abraham Lincoln, &quot;the rail splitter.&quot;

They marched without speaking, eyes fixed straight ahead. Their only sound was the rhythm of a marching drum and the noise of their boots striking the ground in unison. Their marches were at night, lit by torches, in outdoor public places in cities in the American northeast. The gatherings of the Wide Awakes were very different from all previous American political rallies, which featured boisterous daytime parades, songs, and brass bands.

A Boston Wide Awake rally in October 1860 was one of the last before Lincoln was elected and the Civil War began. In this rally, Wide Awakes lit their torches all at the same moment, synchronized by the sound of a single gunshot. They marched in a zig-zag pattern imitating a split-rail fence. They held banners with anti-slavery messages, such as &quot;The Pilgrims Did Not Found an Empire for Slavery&quot;. The rally included both black and white people. A company of 200 Black men, the West Boston Wide Awakes, held a banner reading &quot;God Never Made a Tyrant or a Slave&quot;.

===Chapter organization===
Little is known about the national organization of the Wide Awakes, if indeed any formal governing body existed at all. The clubs seem to have been organized by city into local chapters. Surviving minutes of the Waupun, Wisconsin, chapter restrict membership to males 18 and older. The member had to &quot;furnish himself with the style of uniform adopted by this Club.&quot; The chapter had a military-style officer system consisting of a captain and the 1st to 4th lieutenants.

The Captain shall have command of the Club at all times; in his absence the Lieutenants shall have command in the order of their rank. Every member of this club shall attend all the meetings whether regular or special; and when on duty or in attendance at the meetings, shall obey the officers in command, and shall at all times perform such duties as shall be required of him by the officers in command.

===Social dimensions===
Whatever their names, marching clubs of both parties often had bands and fancy uniforms. The social dimensions have been described:

The young men and boys who joined the Wide-Awakes, Invincibles, and other marching clubs were sold inexpensive uniforms and taught impressive march maneuvers. In Marion the Wide-Awake uniform consisted of an oil cloth cape and cap and a red sash, which along with a lamp or torch cost $1.33. Their &quot;worm fence march&quot; can be imagined, as can a nice connection to Lincoln as rail splitter—a connection that does remind us of the log-cabin and hard cider symbolism of earlier days [of 1840]. The more important connection to be made, however, is to the &quot;militia fever&quot; of the 1850s. Many Americans north and south delighted in military uniforms and titles, musters and parades, and the formal balls their companies sponsored during the winter social season. Their younger brothers no doubt delighted in aping them, so far as $1.33 would allow, while their parents were provided with a means by which youthful rowdyism was, for a time, channeled into a military form of discipline. The regular campaign clubs, meanwhile, were given a different attraction. One of the first items of business, once the club was organized, was to invite &quot;the ladies&quot; to meetings. Many members were single young men, and the campaign occurred during a relatively slow social season following the picnics, steamboat excursions, and other outings of the summer, and preceding the balls sponsored by militia companies, fire companies, and fraternal lodges during the winter. Campaign clubs helped to extend and connect the social seasons for single young men and women, and gave both an occasion for high-spirited travel. &quot;Coming home there was fun,&quot; wrote the Democratic editor of a Dubuque Republican club excursion to a rally in Galena. &quot;There were frequent &#x27;three cheers for Miss Nancy Rogers.&#x27; ... Captain Pat Conger was the best looking man on the ground and we can only say that it is a pity he is not a Democrat.&quot;

===Mission statement===
Typical Wide Awakes chapters also adopted an unofficial mission statement. The following example comes from the Chicago chapter:

# To act as a political police.
# To do escort duty to all prominent Republican speakers who visit our place to address our citizens.
# To attend all public meetings in a body and see that order is kept and that the speaker and meeting is not disturbed.
# To attend the polls and see that justice is done to every legal voter.
# To conduct themselves in such a manner as to induce all Republicans to join them.
# To be a body joined together in large numbers to work for the good of the Republican Ticket.

=== Membership certificate ===

This particular membership certificate of the Wide Awakes has a central vignette showing crowds and troops before the US Capitol. Some of the troops march in long parade lines, others fire cannons into the air toward the Capitol. Crowds line the Capitol steps, flanking a lone figure, probably Abraham Lincoln, who ascends toward the building&#x27;s entrance. The certificate is framed by an American flag draped over a rail fence, with olive branches at the top. In the upper corners are oval medallions of Lincoln (left) and his running mate, Hannibal Hamlin (right). Rail-splitter&#x27;s mallets appear in the corners. A vigilant eye peers from a halo of clouds at the center. On either side stand uniformed members of the society, wearing their characteristic short capes and visored caps. One holds a staff and a lantern (left), and the other holds a burning torch. Below, an eagle on a shield holds arrows, an olive branch, and an E pluribus unum streamer. Broken shackles lie before him. In the left distance, the sun rises over a mountainous landscape and a locomotive chugs across the plains. On the right is a more industrial scene: an Eastern city with its harbor full of boats. In the foreground a man hammers a wedge into a wooden rail.

==Stone&#x27;s Prairie Riot==
In August 1860, a political rally was scheduled to be held at Stone&#x27;s Prairie in Adams County, Illinois, near the modern village of Plainville. This area, in the far west of Illinois, was familiar to two of the presidential candidates. Although the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln, was known in the area, his Democratic opponent, Stephen Douglas, had practiced law nearby. In addition to local animosity, Adams County was close to the border with Missouri, a slave state.

The rally was organized by the Republicans. When it was initially announced, there was an invitation to Democratic speakers. Although the invitation was later withdrawn, that fact was not widely disseminated, which resulted in confusion as to whether it was to be a Republican rally or a debate between Republican and Democratic supporters.

During the 1860 campaign, it was a common practice for settlements to raise poles, as much as high. The political parties hung flags and effigies of the candidates they opposed from the poles.

On the way to the rally, the Quincy Wide Awakes passed through Payson, the residents of which had erected a pole with an offensive effigy of Lincoln astride a rail. The Wide Awakes, however, carried a banner with an equally offensive depiction of a drunken Douglas falling over a pile of rails. An early confrontation was avoided, with the Wide Awakes proceeding to Stone&#x27;s Creek.

The August 25, 1860 rally involved around 7000 participants. Democrats appeared expecting to hear their candidates in a debate. They were instead treated to a podium of Republicans, whom they heckled. The Wide Awakes defended the speakers, and a general melee resulted, involving several hundred men.

After the rally, the Wide Awakes returned through Payson, where they found a hundred Democrats guarding their pole. Although Wide Awakes avoided confrontation, shots were fired at them while they left town. The Wide Awakes&#x27; flag was pierced by shots, and several were reported to have been injured.

==Southern reaction==
In 1860, Texas Senator Louis Wigfall alleged that Wide Awakes were behind a wave of arson and vandalism, opposing &quot;one–half million of men uniformed and drilled, and the purpose of their organization to sweep the country in which I live with fire and sword.&quot; The Wide Awakes represented the region&#x27;s minority of slave and land owners&#x27; greatest fear: an oppressive force bent on marching down, liberating the slaves, stealing their land, and pushing aside their way of life. Their outfits and equipment only further incited that fear with beliefs that &quot;they parade at midnight, carry rails to break open our doors, torches to fire our dwellings, and beneath their long black capes, the knife to cut our throats.&quot;

On October 25, 1858, Senator Seward of New York stated to an excited crowd that &quot;a revolution has begun&quot; and alluded to Wide Awakes as &quot;forces with which to recover back again all the fields... and to confound and overthrow, by one decisive blow, the betrayers of the constitution and freedom forever.&quot; To the South, the Wide Awakes and the North would be content only when the South was fully dominated.

The South recognized the need for their own Wide Awakes and thus started a movement to create &quot;a counteracting organization in the South,&quot; dubbed the &quot;Minutemen,&quot; after the American Revolution militia of the same name. It would no longer entertain the &quot;abhorrence of the rapine, murder, insurrection, pollution and incendiarism which have been plotted by the deluded and vicious of the North, against the chastity, law and prosperity of innocent and unoffending citizens of the South.&quot; The Minutemen were expected &quot;to form an armed body of men... whose duty is to arm, equip and drill, and be ready for any emergency that may arise in the present perilous position of Southern States.&quot; The fear of the Wide Awakes resulted in Minutemen companies forming all over the South. Like their enemy, they too held torch rallies and wore their own uniforms, complete with an official badge of &quot;a blue rosette... to be worn upon the side of the hat.&quot;

In Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, opponents of the Wide Awakes formed the National Volunteers, which were involved in the Baltimore riot of 1861 that produced the first deaths of the American Civil War. In this April 1861 incident, Copperhead anti-war Democrats mobilized the National Volunteers to attack the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania state militias as they passed through the city en route to Washington, D.C..

==Wartime activities==
After Lincoln called out all the militia in April 1861, the Republican Wide Awakes, the Democratic &quot;Douglas Invincibles,&quot; and other parade groups volunteered en masse for the Union army. In 1864, reports of political rallies noted the &quot;Northwestern Wide Awakes, the Great Western Light Guard Band, and the 24th Illinois Infantry&quot; at a Chicago meeting. On November 5, the Chicago Union Campaign Committee, the name of Lincoln&#x27;s party that year, declared:

&quot;On Tuesday next the destiny of the American Republic is to be settled. We appeal to Union men. We appeal to merchants to close their stores, manufacturers to permit their clerks and laborers to go to the polls, the Board of Trade to close, the Union Leagues and Wide Awakes to come out. The rebellion must be put down.&quot;

==Defense of St. Louis==
In early 1861, the Wide Awakes chapter in St. Louis became involved in paramilitary operations at the outbreak of the American Civil War. Aided by Francis Preston Blair Jr. and Army Captain Nathaniel Lyon, the St. Louis Wide Awakes smuggled armaments into the city and trained secretly in a warehouse. The purpose was to prepare them for defense of the federal St. Louis Arsenal, which Confederate supporters wanted to seize. Lyon employed his political connections through Blair to obtain an appointment as commanding officer over the arsenal. Once he had received his promotion, he promptly moved the St. Louis Wide Awakes into the arsenal under the cover of night.

Lyon&#x27;s Wide Awakes, newly mustered into the Union Army, were used on May 10, 1861, to arrest a division of the Missouri State Militia near St. Louis in what would become known as the Camp Jackson Affair. As the captured militia men were marched toward the arsenal, a riot later that day erupted in which scores of civilians were shot or killed. That event marked the effective beginning of the Civil War in Missouri.

==Legacy==
Scholars argue that any connection between the Wide Awakes and the provenance of woke as political slang, irrespective of meanings ascribed thereto, remains tenuous. Conversely, cultural memory of the Wide Awakes has impacted various movements. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, activists dedicated to &quot;artistic sovereignty&quot; and &quot;liberation&quot; intentionally and explicitly &quot; &#x27;sampled and remixed the Wide Awakes&#x27; &quot; as both an idea and social movement. Black Thought, who helped spearhead these &quot; &quot;remixed&#x27; &quot; Wide Awakes, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, &quot; &#x27;throughout history, it&#x27;s been the young people and creatives and intellectuals and philosophers and — just the visionaries — who understood the power in uniting, and who contributed to the greatest progress. So what the Wide Awakes represent, in my mind, is that.&#x27; &quot; Also during the pandemic, Ben Domenech, critic of the Never Trump movement and its allusions to Lincoln&#x27;s Republican Party, praised the Wide Awakes for instilling fear in slaveholders and for their &quot;massive rallies that supported Lincoln, acting as security to the harassment of pro-liberty speakers.&quot; Domenech favored &quot;wide awake&quot; over &quot;wokeness&quot; because the latter was &quot;designed to put you asleep.&quot; In January 2025, the Lincoln Project decried such proponents of Trumpism and alleged attempts to &quot;rewrite history&quot;, including the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

<text>The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) is a labor union that represents approximately 820,000 workers and retirees in the electrical industry in the United States, Canada, Guam, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands; in particular electricians, or inside wiremen, in the construction industry and lineworkers and other employees of public utilities. The union also represents some workers in the computer, telecommunications, and broadcasting industries, and other fields related to electrical work.

==Overview==
The organization now known as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers was founded in 1891, two years before George Westinghouse won the electric current wars by lighting the Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition with alternating current, and before homes and businesses in the United States had begun receiving electricity. It is an international organization, based on the principle of collective bargaining. Its international president is Kenneth W. Cooper and is affiliated with the AFL–CIO.

The beginnings of the IBEW were in the Electrical Wiremen and Linemen&#x27;s Union No. 5221, founded in St. Louis, Missouri in 1890. By 1891, after sufficient interest was shown in a national union, a convention was held on November 21, 1891, in St. Louis. At the convention, the IBEW, then known as the National Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (NBEW), was officially formed. The American Federation of Labor gave the NBEW a charter as an AFL affiliate on December 7, 1891. The union&#x27;s official journal, &quot;The Electrical Worker&quot;, was first published on January 15, 1893, and has been published ever since. At the 1899 convention in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the union&#x27;s name was officially changed to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

The union went through lean times in its early years, then struggled through six years of schism during the 1910s, when two rival groups each claimed to be the duly elected leaders of the union. In 1919, as many employers were trying to drive unions out of the workplace through a national open shop campaign, the union agreed to form the Council on Industrial Relations, a bipartite body made up of equal numbers of management and union representatives with the power to resolve any collective bargaining disputes. That body still functions today, and has largely resolved strikes in the IBEW&#x27;s jurisdiction in the construction industry.

In September 1941, the National Apprenticeship Standards for the Electrical Construction Industry, a joint effort among the IBEW, the National Electrical Contractors Association, and the Federal Committee on Apprenticeship, were established. The IBEW added additional training programs and courses as needed to keep up with new technologies, including an industrial electronics course in 1959 and an industrial nuclear power course in 1966.

Today, the IBEW conducts apprenticeship programs for electricians, linemen, and VDV (voice, data, and video) installers (who install low-voltage wiring such as computer networks), in conjunction with the National Electrical Contractors Association, under the auspices of the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (NJATC), which allows apprentices to &quot;earn while you learn.&quot; In Canadian jurisdictions, the IBEW does not deliver apprenticeship training, but does conduct supplemental training for government trained apprentices and journeypersons, often at little or no cost to its members. The IBEW local 353 Toronto requires all apprentices to be registered with the JAC (Joint Apprenticeship Council) for a number of safety courses, pre-apprenticeship training, pre-trade school courses, supplementary training, and pre-exam courses.

The IBEW&#x27;s membership peaked in 1972 at approximately 1 million members. The membership numbers were in a slow decline throughout the rest of the 1970s and the 1980s, but have since stabilized. One major loss of membership for the IBEW came about because of the court-ordered breakup at the end of 1982 of AT&amp;T, where the IBEW was heavily organized among both telephone workers and in AT&amp;T&#x27;s manufacturing facilities. In 1988, 30 percent of American construction work was unionized while the IBEW had 40 percent of electrical-related construction. Membership as of 2020 stands at about 775,000, according to their official website.

The IBEW supports new construction of nuclear power plants in the United States.

<doc id="1268770" wikidata="Q5333516" url="?curid=1268770" title="Economic interdependence">
<text>Economic interdependence is the mutual dependence of the participants in an economic system who trade in order to obtain the products they cannot produce efficiently for themselves. Such trading relationships require that the behavior of a participant affects its trading partners and it would be costly to rupture their relationship. The subject was addressed by A. A. Cournot who wrote: &quot;...but in reality the economic system is a whole in which all of the parts are connected and react on one another. An increase in the income of the producers of commodity A will affect the demands for commodities B, C, etc. and the incomes of their producers, and by its reaction will affect the demand for commodity A.&quot; Economic Interdependence is evidently a consequence of the division of labour.

David Baldwin conceptualizes international economic interdependence as the opportunity costs incurred from potential exit costs that incur as a result of breaking existing economic ties between nations. Others argue that it entails the degree of sensitivity of a country&#x27;s economic behavior to policies and development of countries outside its border. Global economic interdependence has grown in the post-World War II period as a result of technological progress (e.g. computerization, containerization, low-cost travel, low-cost communications) and associated policies that were aimed at opening national economies internally and externally to global competition.

Some international relations scholars posit that economic interdependence contributes to peaceful relations between states. Other scholars argue that the relationship is more nuanced or emphasize the ways in which interdependence can contribute to conflict between states. For example, through their work on &quot;weaponized interdependence&quot;, Abraham Newman and Henry Farrell have outlined how states that possess effective jurisdiction over central economic nodes can use these nodes for coercive economic leverage against adversaries. Viktor Cha has argued that economic interdependence in East Asia can both be a tool of coercion by China but can also be exploited by China&#x27;s neighbors to deter China if they all work together against China.

== Economic interdependence and conflict ==
International relations scholars are divided as to whether economic interdependence contributes to peace or conflict. Statistical analyses indicate that economic interdependence can lead both to war and peace, with various factors that condition the effect of interdependence. Dale C. Copeland argues that expectations about future trade affects whether economic interdependence is likely to lead to peace or conflict; when leaders do not believe that future trade patterns will be favorable, they are more likely to engage in conflict and competition than when they believe that future trade patterns will be beneficial to their state. According to Henry Farrell and Abraham L. Newman, states can &quot;weaponize interdependence&quot; by fighting over control of important nodes in global networks of informational and financial exchange. Realists such as John Mearsheimer and Joseph Grieco argue that interdependence increase the risk of conflict by creating dependencies and vulnerabilities that states will seek to rid themselves off; for example, states will fear that other states cut off access to key resources.

Beth Simmons and Patrick McDonald argue that interdependence creates groups in liberal capitalist states with vested interests in the status quo, which makes conflict less likely. However, illiberal states or states where domestic groups benefit from trade barriers may be more likely to end up in conflict over trade relations. According to Stephen G. Brooks, globalization of production has had a pacifying impact on great powers by (i) making it hard for great powers to have cutting edge military technology without being part of global supply chains, (ii) reducing incentives to conquer the territory of economically advanced countries, and (iii) facilitating regional integration.

The outbreak of World War I during a period of unprecedented globalization and economic interdependence has often been cited as an example of how economic interdependence fails to prevent war or even contributes to it. Other scholars dispute that World War I was a failure for liberal theory.

According to a 2005 assessment of existing research, the existing research indicated that trade linkages reduce conflict. 

== Approaches to measure international economic interdependence ==
As economic interdependence may be perceived differently depending on the scale and context involved, various methods are used to measure the degree of interdependence between and within countries. The below documents some of the approaches that have been adopted to measure the degree of economic interdependence.

=== Hierarchical Network Approach ===

This approach is based on the precept that globalisation increases the integration and interdependence between the economy of different countries. The Hierarchical Network Approach is used to measure economic interdependence by analysing growth clusters and cross-country liaison, and business cycle synchronisations. The cross-country liaison or economic interaction between countries or states is most commonly measured by Pearson&#x27;s cross-correlation coefficient. The correlation matrix is a methodical method which exhibits the mutual relationship of countries over a specified time period. To measure growth clusters, economists need to get hold and analyse changes in GDP for each country over a specified period of time. The relationship between interdependence and business cycles is calculated by the distance correlation matrices over a period of 10 years. The combination of results from the data presents the economic interdependence of countries over time. By this measure, trends from the data has shown that the degree of world economic interdependence is growing due to globalisation.

=== Geopolitical Approach ===
Another way of measuring the degree of economic interdependence is via a geopolitical approach, which is based on the presumption that economic interdependence may exist because states trade with each other to obtain strategic goods that are needed for national industry and defence. The geopolitical approach is based on both vertical and horizontal interdependence. Vertical interdependence measures how a change in the price of a good in Country X will affect Country Y (or how changes in price in State A will affect State B), whilst horizontal interdependence calculates the degree of bilateral trade, transactions and investment involved between both countries. Both vertical and horizontal interdependence data must be used to measure economic interdependence. This is because that in the given situation that there is a high correlation of vertical interdependence between country X and country Y, if there is no horizontal interdependence (transaction of goods, services or capitals) between both countries, country X and country Y will have little/no economic interdependence. Vertical interdependence without horizontal may arise due to other factors such as changes in worldwide economic forces. For instance, consider the case of trade and the flow of factors among Arab states (which is typically very limited); whilst we observe parallel movements in factor prices, this may just be due to the effect of global market forces that affect all economies in the same fashion.

=== Exit Model Approach ===
As suggested by Baldwin and Crescenzi, economic interdependence may be modelled as a function of potential economic exit costs, which may deter, motivate or fail to affect political conflict. A key challenge that is faced is the need for a valid method to measure exit costs and interdependence, whilst maintaining a systematic approach with many countries involved (a large-n analysis). Crescenzi addresses this by interacting bilateral price elasticity data with trade activity data, to represent both market structure and the intensity of potential economic exit costs. Whilst the price elasticity data reflects one state&#x27;s ability to react to economic change that is initiated by another state, its interaction with trade share data is vital as it indicates how intense the interdependent relationship is relative to each state&#x27;s economy and trade portfolio within the global market. Given these two components, Crescenzi furthers his study by explaining the relationship between economic interdependence and its association with political conflict.

<doc id="1268771" wikidata="Q1903520" url="?curid=1268771" title="Binondo">
<text>Binondo () is a district in Manila and is referred to as the city&#x27;s Chinatown. Its influence extends beyond to the places of Quiapo, Santa Cruz, San Nicolas and Tondo. It is the oldest Chinatown in the world, established in 1594 by the Spaniards as a settlement near Intramuros but across the Pasig River for Catholic Chinese; it was positioned so that the colonial administration could keep a close eye on their migrant subjects. It was already a hub of Chinese commerce even before the Spanish colonial period. Binondo is the center of commerce and trade of Manila, where all types of business run by Chinese Filipinos thrive.

Noted residents include Saint Lorenzo Ruiz, the Filipino protomartyr, and Venerable Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo, founder of the Congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary.

== Etymology ==
Numerous theories on the origin of the name &quot;Binondo&quot;, and that of &quot;Tondo&quot;, its neighboring district, have been put forward. Philippine National Artist Nick Joaquin suggested that the names might have been derived from the archaic spelling of the Tagalog term &quot;binondoc&quot; (modern orthography: &quot;binundók&quot;), or mountainous, referring to Binondo&#x27;s originally hilly terrain. French linguist Jean-Paul Potet, however, has suggested that the river mangrove (&quot;Aegiceras corniculatum&quot;), which at the time was called &quot;tundok&quot; (&quot;tinduk-tindukan&quot; today), is the most likely origin of the term, with the &#x27;Bi-&quot; prefix in &quot;Binondo&quot; indicating Binondo&#x27;s location relative to Tondo.

== History ==
Founded in 1594, Binondo was created by Spanish Governor Luis Pérez Dasmariñas as a permanent settlement for Chinese immigrants (the Spanish called the Chinese &quot;sangleys&quot;) who converted to Catholicism. It was across the river from the walled city of Intramuros, where the Spaniards resided. Originally it was intended to replace the Parian near Intramuros, where Sangley Chinese merchants and artisans were first confined. The Spanish gave a land grant for Binondo to a group of Chinese merchants and artisans in perpetuity, tax-free and with limited self-governing privileges. The area also served as a midpoint in between Parián (modern-day Arroceros Urban Forest Park) and San Nicolas, since way before the Spanish conquest of Manila in the Battle of Manila (1570), a Sangley Chinese community had already settled in Baybay (former name of San Nicolas, Manila) near Tondo on the north bank of the Pasig river directly on Binondo&#x27;s west.The Spanish Dominican fathers made Binondo their parish and succeeded in converting many of the residents to Catholicism. Binondo soon became the place where Chinese immigrants converted to Catholicism, intermarried with indigenous Filipino women and had children, who became the Chinese &quot;mestizo&quot; community. Over the years, the Chinese mestizo population of Binondo grew rapidly. This was caused mainly because the lack of Chinese immigrant females and the Spanish officials&#x27; policy of expelling or killing (in conflicts) Chinese immigrants who refused to convert.

In 1603, a Chinese revolt took place led by Juan Suntay, a wealthy Chinese Catholic. It was put down by joint Spanish and Filipino forces led by Luis Pérez Dasmariñas. In the aftermath most of the 20,000 Chinese that composed the colony were killed. The revolt took place right after a visit to Manila by three official Chinese representatives who disclosed they were searching for &quot;a mountain of gold&quot;. This strange claim prompted the Spanish to conclude that there was an imminent invasion from China in the making. At the time the local Chinese outnumbered the Spaniards by twenty to one, and Spanish authorities feared that they would join the invading forces. The Chinese afterward played down those events in an attempt to preserve their commercial interests. In 1605, a Fukien official issued a letter claiming that the Chinese who had participated in the revolt were unworthy of China&#x27;s protection, describing them as &quot;deserters of the tombs of their ancestors&quot;.

During the brief British occupation of Manila, between 1762 and 1764, Binondo was damaged during the capture of the city. The new governor of Manila, Dawsonne Drake, formed a war council which he termed the &quot;Chottry Court&quot;. Drake imprisoned several Manilans on charges known &quot;only known to himself&quot;, according Captain Thomas Backhouse, who denounced Drake&#x27;s court as a sham.
Binondo became the main center for business and finance in Manila for the ethnic Chinese, Chinese mestizos and Spanish Filipinos. During the Spanish colonial period, many &quot;esteros&quot; (canals) were constructed in the Binondo area, from where they entered the Pasig River. Among the many who married at the historic Binondo Church was Andres Bonifacio in 1895, who became a hero of the Philippine Revolution.

Before World War II, Binondo was the center of a banking and financial community which included insurance companies, commercial banks and other financial institutions from Britain and the United States. These banks were located mostly along &quot;Escólta&quot;, which used to be called the &quot;Wall Street of the Philippines&quot;.

After the war and new development, most businesses began to relocate to the newer Zobel de Ayala family-led area of Makati. During the financial crisis of the early 1980s under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, it had the moniker &quot;Binondo Central Bank&quot;, as the local Chinese businessmen engaged in massive black market trading of US dollars, which often determined the national peso-dollar exchange rate. Given its rich historical and financial significance, Binondo is said to have one of the highest land values nationwide.

The Binondo was plot setting for the episode &quot;Mata&quot; and &quot;Mukha&quot; of the 2010 horror film &quot;Cinco&quot;.

<text>Harold Pender (13 January 1879, Tarboro, North Carolina – 6 Kennebunkport, Maine1959) was an American academic, author, and inventor. He was the first Dean of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering, a position he held from the founding of the School in 1923 until his retirement in 1949. During his tenure, the Moore School built the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, and began construction of its successor machine, the EDVAC. Pender also proposed the Moore School Lectures, the first course in computers, which the Moore School offered by invitation in the summer of 1946.

Pender was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1913 and the American Philosophical Society in 1917.

The Harold Pender Award is named after him.

== Theological views ==

=== Neo-Evangelicalism ===
Rolland D. McCune was highly critical of the Neo-Evangelical movement, instead preferring Christian fundamentalism. He rejected the lack of ecclesiastical separation and his perceived priority of pragmatism within neo-Evangelicalism.

=== Bibliology ===
Although Rolland D. McCune criticized individuals who would deny the doctrine of preservation of the scriptures, he did not teach King James Onlyism unlike most Independent Baptists do. He instead argued that the words of God are preserved in the manuscript tradition as a whole.

=== Dispensationalism ===
Rolland D. McCune was dispensationalist, being strongly critical of post-millennialism. 

=== Doctrine of God ===
McCune was a upheld the doctrine of the trinity, seeing it as a necessary doctrine of scripture. He believed there are functional differences in the economic Trinity, arguing that in the administration and activities of the Trinity, the Son is subordinate to the Father, and the Spirit is subordinate to both the Father and the Son. However, he taught that the distinctions of the persons of the Trinity within the essence of God, as well as the order of their works, are explained by the eternal generation of the Son and the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and Son. McCune argued that the Greek word &quot;monogenēs&quot; used in John 3:16 implies the idea of &quot;begottenness,&quot; viewing it as confirmation of the doctrine of eternal generation. He believed the eternal relations of generation and procession ground the structure and order of the Trinity&#x27;s works in creation.

<doc id="1268800" wikidata="Q50997" url="?curid=1268800" title="Hilla Limann">
<text>Hilla Limann, (12 December 1934 – 23 January 1998) was a Ghanaian diplomat and politician who served as the eight president of Ghana from 1979 to 1981. He previously served as a diplomat in Lomé and in Geneva.

==Education==
Limann, whose original last name was Babini, was born in the northern Gold Coast town of Gwollu in the Sissala West District of the Upper West Region. Limann completed his basic school education at the Government Middle School, Tamale, in 1949. Between 1957 and 1960, he studied political science at the London School of Economics. He subsequently completed a diploma in French at the Sorbonne University, France. He also obtained a BA (Hons) degree in history at the University of London and a Ph.D. in political science and constitutional law at the University of Paris.

==Foreign service==
Limann held the position of head of Europe Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ghana between 1965 and 1968. During 1967, he was a member of the Constitution Commission which drafted the 1969 Constitution of Ghana. In 1968, he became the head of Chancery/Official Secretary at the Ghana embassy in Lomé, Togo. He was appointed counsellor at Ghana&#x27;s Permanent Mission in Geneva, Switzerland in 1971. He assumed the position of head of Europe, Americas, and Southeast Asia Desk back in Ghana at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in June 1975.

==Politics==
Following the 1979 coup led by Jerry Rawlings, Limann was elected President on the People&#x27;s National Party ticket and had strong support among followers of former Ghana President Kwame Nkrumah. He stood for the elections following the disqualification of Alhaji Imoru Egala by the then ruling Supreme Military Council and won 62% of the popular vote in the second round of voting.

Dr. Limann assumed office as president on 24 September 1979. He was an economic moderate, and supported democratic values and Pan-Africanism. He was deposed in a coup by Rawlings on 31 December 1981. He thus was the only president of the third republic of Ghana.

In 1992, at the end of the PNDC military rule that overthrew him, Dr. Limann once again found himself involved in politics and stood as the candidate of the People&#x27;s National Convention, a new party he founded, in the presidential election that year. He received 6.7% of the popular vote in the elections, coming third. He remained active among the Nkrumahist political movement in Ghana until his death.

==Addendum==
After the handover ceremony in 1979, Military intelligence personnel consistently reported destabilising activities of former members of the AFRC. Dr. Limman insisted that there were no legal justifications to hold them in custody under a democratic dispensation. This decision eventually cost him the presidency and the years of humiliation and alienation he suffered at the hands of the Rawlings administration.

==Death and burial==
Limann had chronic health problems and later died of natural causes. He was survived by his wife, Fulera Limann, and seven children: Lariba Montia (née Limann), Baba Limann, Sibi Andan (née Limann), Lida Limann, Daani Limann, Zilla Limann and Salma Limann. He was buried at private burial ceremony in his home town, Gwollu in the Sisala District of the Upper West Region at midnight on 1 March 1998. A government delegation led by the then Minister of Defence, Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu were present to mourn with the family.

== Hilla Limann Foundation ==
The Hilla Limann Foundation is a charity that was launched on the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of his presidency in September 2019. Its aims are to end the abuse of human rights through education, championing the cause of human development for the poor and vulnerable, engender enlightenment about true democracy and promote the awareness of human rights.

==Honours==
Limann was honoured with the Knight Grand Cross of St Michael and St George by Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom in 1981. The same year, he was awarded the Order of the Yugoslav Great Star.

<doc id="1268809" wikidata="Q653193" url="?curid=1268809" title="Slow Motion (Supertramp album)">
<text>Slow Motion is the eleventh and final studio album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in April 2002.

==Overview==
In North America, &quot;Slow Motion&quot; was only available via mail-order from the band&#x27;s website, released on their own label.

The song &quot;Goldrush&quot; was actually written in the early 1970s under the first Supertramp line-up, by original guitarist Richard Palmer-James, and was used as the opening number in all their shows prior to &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. The band had tried to record it on several previous occasions, but had never before been able to recreate it in the studio to their satisfaction. While the album credits the song to Davies and Palmer-James only, Roger Hodgson supposedly co-wrote it.

==Reception==

AllMusic praised the songs and diversity in styles, but criticized the production and runtime.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Rick Davies, except where noted.

#&quot;Slow Motion&quot; – 3:50
#&quot;Little By Little&quot; – 4:30

<doc id="1268813" wikidata="Q1795966" url="?curid=1268813" title="King Leopold's Soliloquy">
<text>King Leopold&#x27;s Soliloquy is a 1905 pamphlet by American author Mark Twain. Its subject is King Leopold&#x27;s rule over the Congo Free State. A work of political satire harshly condemnatory of his actions, it ostensibly recounts a fictional monologue of Leopold II speaking in his own defense.

== Content ==
King Leopold II raves madly about the good things that he says he has done for the people of the Congo Free State, including the disbursement of millions on religion and art. He says he had come to Congo with piety &quot;oozing&quot; from &quot;every pore&quot;, that he had only wanted to convert the people to Christianity, that he had wanted to stop the slave trade.

Leopold II says that he did not take any of the government money, that he did not use the revenues as his personal &quot;swag&quot;, and that such claims by the &quot;meddlesome American missionaries&quot;, &quot;frank British consuls&quot;, and &quot;blabbing Belgian-born traitors&quot; are wholly false. He asserts that for a king to be criticized as he has been is blasphemy—surely, under the rule of God, any king who was not doing God&#x27;s will would not have been helped by God.

The book mentions the critical report by the missionary William Henry Sheppard on an 1899 massacre of over 80 people by Zappo Zaps sent to collect taxes.
Leopold claims that his critics only speak of what is unfavorable to him, such as the unfair taxes that he levied upon the people of the Congo, which caused starvation and the extermination of entire villages, but not of the fact that he had sent missionaries to the villages to convert them to Christianity.
== Publication ==
The book was published in English, French, German and Italian. Two German-language editions were published in East Germany in 1961 and 1967 and a further edition was published in 2014. The American publisher P. R. Warren Company from Boston, donated all surplus to relief and aid in the Congo atrocities.

<doc id="1268815" wikidata="Q5158997" url="?curid=1268815" title="Concordia University Ann Arbor">
<text>Concordia University Ann Arbor (CUAA) is the Ann Arbor, Michigan, campus of Concordia University Wisconsin, a private Lutheran university in Mequon, Wisconsin. As part of Concordia University, it is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

Concordia University Ann Arbor&#x27;s campus sits on the banks of the Huron River, about ten minutes outside downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan. Concordia is affiliated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and is a member of the Concordia University System. CUAA merged with Concordia University Wisconsin in 2013.

==History==
In the early 1960s, the LCMS purchased the Earhart Manor and surrounding estate in Ann Arbor and began construction of Concordia Lutheran Junior College. The campus was designed by architect Vincent Kling in a mid-century modern style. Classes began in the fall of 1963 with 236 students and 24 instructors. The school began offering four-year degree programs in 1976 and changed its name to Concordia College. It assumed its current name in 2001.

In 1977, Concordia began performing the &quot;Boars Head Festival&quot;, an annual Christmas celebration filled with song, music, and drama that is much beloved by current students, alumni, and community members.

In the 2000s, the university experienced &quot;a number of financial, enrollment and administrative difficulties&quot; that prompted it to enter into discussions with Concordia University Wisconsin about a possible merger. The merger became effective on July 1, 2013, with Curt Gielow, former executive dean of CUW&#x27;s School of Pharmacy and former mayor of Mequon, Wisconsin, becoming Vice President of Administration and Chief Campus Officer at CUAA. He was replaced at the end of 2018 by Ryan Peterson.

In 2015, the university purchased the former Ann Arbor campus of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School. That facility, north of the main campus, is now the home of CUAA&#x27;s School of Nursing.

In 2022, the university named Erik Ankerberg its next president. He began his duties in January 2023, prior to the spring semester.

In mid-February 2024 local news sources reported that Ankerberg had alerted the students, faculty, and staff that the university&#x27;s financial situation was forcing the Ann Arbor campus&#x27;s mission to be &quot;re-imagined&quot;, likely leading to significant reductions in the programs and the sale of some of the equipment and property. John Berg, chairman of the board, released a video stating that the campus would remain at full operations for the 2024-2025 academic year. He also stated that a sub-committee was created to help develop a path forward, which was later revealed, to help the university separate from the Wisconsin campus. The plan to become independent was later deemed to be unworkable and instead the institution&#x27;s leaders decided to cut most academic programs. Beginning in June 2025, the institution will only offer 9 programs on campus, all focused on healthcare, and 7 programs online, mostly focused on education; this is a reduction from 53 programs previously offered on campus and 60 programs previously offered online.

==Athletics==
The Concordia–Ann Arbor (CUAA) athletic teams are called the Cardinals. The school&#x27;s mascot is named Corky the Cardinal. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) for most of its sports since the 1992–93 academic year; while its football team competes in the Mideast League of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA). They are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the Midwest Region of the Division I level.

CUAA competes in 28 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor). Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, stunt, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, competitive dance and eSports.

<doc id="1268818" wikidata="Q1072367" url="?curid=1268818" title="Ruby-topaz hummingbird">
<text>The ruby-topaz hummingbird (Chrysolampis mosquitus), commonly referred to simply as the ruby topaz, is a species of hummingbird in the subfamily Polytminae, the mangoes. It is found in Aruba, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Curaçao, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy==
The ruby-topaz hummingbird was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Trochilus mosquitus&quot;. The type locality is Suriname. The ruby-topaz hummingbird is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Chrysolampis&quot;, which was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1831. The name &quot;Chrysolampis&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;khrusolampis&quot; meaning &quot;glow-worm&quot;. The specific name &quot;mosquitus&quot; is a Spanish diminutive and means &quot;little fly&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The ruby-topaz hummingbird is long and weighs . Its almost straight, black bill is relatively short compared to those of most other hummingbirds. The male has dark brown upperparts with an olive gloss. Its crown and nape are glossy ruby red, and the throat and breast are usually iridescent golden though sometimes emerald green. The rest of the underparts are brown and the chestnut tail is tipped black.

The female ruby-topaz hummingbird has bronze-green upperparts and pale grey underparts. The tail is mostly chestnut with a dark subterminal band and a white tip; the central feathers are olive green. Females on Trinidad and Tobago sometimes have a greenish throat-streak (it may appear dark). Juvenile females are similar to adult females, but with a white-tipped dusky-brown tail. Juvenile males resemble the juvenile female, but with a variable amount of iridescent orange to the throat.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ruby-topaz hummingbird is found from eastern Panama east through northern Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas into northeastern Brazil. From there it is found through central and eastern Brazil as far south as Mato Grosso and westward into eastern Bolivia. In Colombia its range extends southward between the three Andes ranges, and it is also found in the ABC Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. It has been recorded as a vagrant in Argentina and Peru and there is at least one unconfirmed sight record in Paraguay.

The ruby-topaz hummingbird inhabits the interior and edges of open savanna-like landscapes and shrubby arid hillsides; it is found in gardens and cultivated areas as well. It mostly occurs below of elevation but is found as high as .

==Behavior==
===Movement===
The ruby-topaz hummingbird is migratory, though its movement pattern and timing vary across its range and are not well defined. It appears to move north and south in Brazil and east and west along the north coast of South America and the offshore islands.

===Feeding===
The ruby-topaz hummingbird feeds on nectar from a wide variety of flowering shrubs, trees, epiphytes, cacti, and crops. However, they prefer the flowers of the samaan tree and the &quot;Ixora&quot; plant since these flowers have a high sugar content. Males defend feeding territories. The species also catches small insects and spiders on the wing and sometimes gleans them from within foliage.

===Breeding===
The ruby-topaz hummingbird&#x27;s breeding season varies across its range. In the northern part it spans from December to June and in much of Brazil from September to March. The female makes a tiny cup nest of fine plant fibers and spider silk decorated on the outside with lichens. It places it on a branch or in a branch fork, typically between above the ground. The clutch size is two eggs. The incubation time is 15 to 16 days with fledging usually 19 to 22 days after hatch, though sometimes as long as 28 days.

===Vocalization===
The ruby-topaz hummingbird&#x27;s song is &quot;a doubled &#x27;tliii...tliii...tliii&#x27;&quot;, which is usually given from a high perch.

==Status==
The IUCN has assessed the ruby-topaz hummingbird as being of Least Concern, though its population size and trend are unknown. It is a &quot;[c]ommon resident in the lowlands and coastal ranges&quot; and &quot;[r]eadily accepts man-made habitats&quot;.

<text>Harriet E. Wilson (March 15, 1825 – June 28, 1900) was an African-American novelist. She was the first African American to publish a novel in North America.

Her novel &quot;Our Nig, or Sketches from the Life of a Free Black&quot; was published anonymously in 1859 in Boston, Massachusetts, and was not widely known. The novel was discovered in 1982 by the scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who documented it as the first African American novel published in the United States.

Born a free person of color (free Negro) in New Hampshire, Wilson was orphaned when young and bound until the age of 18 as an indentured servant. She struggled to make a living after that, marrying twice. Her only son George died at the age of seven in the poor house, where she had placed him while trying to survive as a widow. She wrote one novel. Wilson later was associated with the Spiritualist church, was paid on the public lecture circuit for her lectures about her life, and worked as a housekeeper in a boarding house.

==Biography==

Born Harriet E. &quot;Hattie&quot; Adams in Milford, New Hampshire, she was the mixed-race daughter of Margaret Ann (or Adams) Smith, a washerwoman of Irish ancestry, and Joshua Green, an African American &quot;hooper of barrels&quot; of mixed African and Indian ancestry. After her father died when Hattie was young, her mother abandoned Hattie at the farm of Nehemiah Hayward Jr., a wealthy Milford farmer &quot;connected to the Hutchinson Family Singers&quot;. As an orphan, Adams was bound by the courts as an indentured servant to the Hayward family, a customary way for society at the time to arrange support and education for orphans. The intention was that, in exchange for labor, the orphan child would be given room, board and training in life skills, so that she could later make her way in society. 
From their documentary research, the scholars P. Gabrielle Foreman and Reginald H. Pitts believe that the Hayward family were the inspiration for the &quot;Bellmont&quot; family depicted in &quot;Our Nig&quot;. (This was the family who held the young &quot;Frado&quot; in indentured servitude, abusing her physically and mentally from the age of six to 18. Foreman and Pitts&#x27; research material was incorporated in supporting sections of the 2004 edition of &quot;Our Nig&quot;.)
After the end of her indentured servitude at the age of 18, Hattie Adams (as she was then known), worked as a house servant and a seamstress in households in southern New Hampshire.

===Marriage and family===
Adams married Thomas Wilson in Milford on October 6, 1851. An escaped slave, Wilson had been traveling around New England giving lectures based on his life. Although he continued to lecture periodically in churches and town squares, he told Hattie that he had never been a slave and that he had created the story to gain support from abolitionists.
Wilson abandoned Harriet soon after they married. Pregnant and ill, Harriet Wilson was sent to the Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Poor Farm in Goffstown, where her only son, George Mason Wilson, was born. His probable birth date was June 15, 1852. Soon after George&#x27;s birth, Wilson reappeared and took the two away from the Poor Farm. He returned to sea, where he served as a sailor, and died soon after.
As a widow, Harriet Wilson returned her son George to the care of the Poor Farm, as she could not make enough money to support them both and provide for his care while she worked. However, George died at the age of seven on February 16, 1860, of bilious fever. 
After that, Wilson moved to Boston, hoping for more work opportunities. On September 29, 1870, Wilson married again, to John Gallatin Robinson in Boston. An apothecary, he was either a native of Sherbrooke, Quebec or of Woodbury, Connecticut. Robinson was of English and German ancestry; he was nearly 18 years younger than Wilson. From 1870 to 1877, they resided at 46 Carver Street, after which they appear to have separated. After that date, city directories list Wilson and Robinson in separate lodgings in Boston&#x27;s South End. No record has been found of a divorce, but divorces were infrequent at the time.

===Writing a novel===

While living in Boston, Wilson wrote &quot;Our Nig&quot;. On August 14, 1859, she copyrighted it, and deposited a copy of the novel in the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. On September 5, 1859, the novel was published anonymously by George C. Rand and Avery, a publishing firm in Boston. Wilson writes in the book&#x27;s preface that she wrote the novel to raise money to help care for her sick child, George.
In 1863, Harriet Wilson appeared on the &quot;Report of the Overseers of the Poor&quot; for the town of Milford, New Hampshire. After 1863, she disappeared from records until 1867, when she was listed in the Boston Spiritualist newspaper, &quot;Banner of Light,&quot; as living in East Cambridge, Massachusetts. She subsequently moved across the Charles River to the city of Boston, where she became known in Spiritualist circles as &quot;the colored medium.&quot; From 1867 to 1897, &quot;Mrs. Hattie E. Wilson&quot; was listed in the &quot;Banner of Light&quot; as a trance reader and lecturer. She was active in the local Spiritualist community, and she would give &quot;lectures,&quot; either while entranced, or speaking normally, wherever she was wanted. She spoke at camp meetings, in theaters and meeting houses and in private homes throughout New England; she shared the podium with speakers such as Victoria Woodhull, Cora L. V. Scott and Andrew Jackson Davis. In 1870, Wilson traveled as far as Chicago, Illinois as a delegate to the American Association of Spiritualists convention. Wilson delivered lectures on labor reform and children&#x27;s education. Although the texts of her talks have not survived, newspaper reports imply that she often spoke about her life experiences, providing sometimes trenchant and often humorous commentary.

Wilson worked as a Spiritualist nurse and healer (&quot;clairvoyant physician&quot;); as a &quot;spiritual healer,&quot; she was also available for medical consultations and would make house calls. She was active in the organization and operation of Children&#x27;s Progressive Lyceums, that served as Sunday Schools for the children of Spiritualists; she organized Christmas celebrations; she participated in skits and playlets; and at meetings she sometime sang as part of a quartet. She was also known for her floral centerpieces, and the candies she would make for the children were long remembered.
In addition, for nearly 20 years from 1879 to 1897, Wilson was the housekeeper of a boardinghouse in a two-story dwelling at 15 Village Street (near the present corner of East Berkeley Street and Tremont Streets in the South End.) She rented out rooms, collected rents and provided basic maintenance.

In Wilson&#x27;s life after &quot;Our Nig&quot;, there is no evidence that she wrote anything else for publication.

On June 28, 1900, Hattie E. Wilson died in the Quincy Hospital in Quincy, Massachusetts.

==Competition for &quot;first novel&quot;==
Scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. rediscovered &quot;Our Nig&quot; in 1982 and documented it as the first novel by an African American to be published in the United States. His discovery and the novel gained national attention, and it was republished with an introduction by Gates. It has subsequently been republished in several other editions.

In 2006, William L. Andrews, an English literature professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Mitch Kachun, a history professor at Western Michigan University, brought to light Julia C. Collins&#x27; &quot;The Curse of Caste; or The Slave Bride&quot; (1865), first published in serial form in &quot;The Christian Recorder,&quot; newspaper of the AME Church. Publishing it in book form in 2006, they maintained that &quot;The Curse of Caste&quot; should be considered the first &quot;truly imagined&quot; novel by an African American to be published in the U.S. They argued that &quot;Our Nig&quot; was more autobiography than fiction. 
Gates responded that numerous other novels and other works of fiction of the period were in some part based on real-life events and were in that sense autobiographical, but they were still considered novels. Examples include Fanny Fern&#x27;s &quot;Ruth Hall&quot; (1854), Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; (1868–69), and Hannah Webster Foster&#x27;s &quot;The Coquette&quot; (1797).

The first known novel by an African American is William Wells Brown&#x27;s &quot;Clotel; or, The President&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1853), published in the United Kingdom, where he was living at the time. The critic Sven Birkerts argued that the unfinished state of &quot;The Curse of Caste&quot; (Collins died before completing it) and its poor literary quality should disqualify it as the first building block of African-American literature. He contended the works by Wilson and Brown were more fully realized.

Eric Gardner thought that &quot;Our Nig&quot; did not receive critical acclaim from abolitionists when first published because it did not conform to the contemporary genre of slave narratives. He thinks the abolitionists may have refrained from promoting &quot;Our Nig&quot; because the novel recounts &quot;slavery&#x27;s shadow&quot; in the North, where free blacks suffered as indentured servants and from racism. It does not offer the promise of freedom, and it features a protagonist who is assertive toward a white woman.

In her article &quot;Dwelling in the House of Oppression: The Spatial, Racial, and Textual Dynamics of Harriet Wilson&#x27;s Our Nig&quot;, Lois Leveen argues that, although the novel is about a free black in the north, the &quot;free black&quot; is still oppressed. The &quot;white house&quot; of the novel represents, as Leveen puts it: &quot;The model home for American society is built according to the spatial imperatives of slavery.&quot; Frado is a &quot;free black&quot;, but she is treated as a lower-class person and is often abused as a slave would be. Leveen argues that Wilson was expressing her view that even the &quot;free blacks&quot; were not free in a racist society.

== Legacy and honors ==
Since Gates&#x27; work in 1982, Wilson has been recognized as the first African American to publish a novel in the United States. The Harriet Wilson Project commissioned a statue of Wilson in 2006—sculpted by Fern Cunningham, the statue is located in Bicentennial Park in Milford, New Hampshire. A historical marker on the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire honoring Wilson was unveiled in Milford on May 20, 2023.

<doc id="1268823" wikidata="Q908724" url="?curid=1268823" title="Real gas">
<text>Real gases are non-ideal gases whose molecules occupy space and have interactions; consequently, they do not adhere to the ideal gas law.
To understand the behaviour of real gases, the following must be taken into account:

*compressibility effects;
*variable specific heat capacity;
*van der Waals forces;
*non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects;
*issues with molecular dissociation and elementary reactions with variable composition

For most applications, such a detailed analysis is unnecessary, and the ideal gas approximation can be used with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, real-gas models have to be used near the condensation point of gases, near critical points, at very high pressures, to explain the Joule–Thomson effect, and in other less usual cases. The deviation from ideality can be described by the compressibility factor Z.

==Models==


===Van der Waals model===

Real gases are often modeled by taking into account their molar weight and molar volume
:formula_1

or alternatively:
:formula_2

Where &quot;p&quot; is the pressure, &quot;T&quot; is the temperature, &quot;R&quot; the ideal gas constant, and &quot;V&quot;m the molar volume. &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parameters that are determined empirically for each gas, but are sometimes estimated from their critical temperature (&quot;T&quot;c) and critical pressure (&quot;p&quot;c) using these relations:
:formula_3

The constants at critical point can be expressed as functions of the parameters a, b:
:formula_4

With the reduced properties formula_5 the equation can be written in the &quot;reduced form&quot;:
:formula_6

===Redlich–Kwong model===

The Redlich–Kwong equation is another two-parameter equation that is used to model real gases. It is almost always more accurate than the van der Waals equation, and often more accurate than some equations with more than two parameters. The equation is
:formula_7

or alternatively:
:formula_8

where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are two empirical parameters that are not the same parameters as in the van der Waals equation. These parameters can be determined:
:formula_9

The constants at critical point can be expressed as functions of the parameters a, b:
:formula_10

Using formula_11 the equation of state can be written in the &quot;reduced form&quot;:
: formula_12 with formula_13

===Berthelot and modified Berthelot model===
The Berthelot equation (named after D. Berthelot) is very rarely used,
:formula_14

but the modified version is somewhat more accurate
:formula_15

===Dieterici model===
This model (named after C. Dieterici) fell out of usage in recent years
:formula_16

with parameters a, b. These can be normalized by dividing with the critical point state:formula_17which casts the equation into the reduced form:formula_18

===Clausius model===
The Clausius equation (named after Rudolf Clausius) is a very simple three-parameter equation used to model gases.
:formula_19

or alternatively:
:formula_20

where
:formula_21

where &quot;V&quot;c is critical volume.

===Virial model===
The Virial equation derives from a perturbative treatment of statistical mechanics.
:formula_22

or alternatively
:formula_23

where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;A&quot;′, &quot;B&quot;′, and &quot;C&quot;′ are temperature dependent constants.

===Peng–Robinson model===
Peng–Robinson equation of state (named after D.-Y. Peng and D. B. Robinson) has the interesting property being useful in modeling some liquids as well as real gases.
:formula_24

===Wohl model===
The Wohl equation (named after A. Wohl) is formulated in terms of critical values, making it useful when real gas constants are not available, but it cannot be used for high densities, as for example the critical isotherm shows a drastic &quot;decrease&quot; of pressure when the volume is contracted beyond the critical volume.
:formula_25

or:
: formula_26

or, alternatively:
:formula_27

where
:formula_28
:formula_29 with formula_30
:formula_31, where formula_32 are (respectively) the molar volume, the pressure and the temperature at the critical point.

And with the reduced properties formula_11 one can write the first equation in the &quot;reduced form&quot;:
:formula_34

===Beattie–Bridgeman model===
 This equation is based on five experimentally determined constants. It is expressed as
:formula_35

where
:formula_36

This equation is known to be reasonably accurate for densities up to about 0.8 &quot;ρ&quot;cr, where &quot;ρ&quot;cr is the density of the substance at its critical point. The constants appearing in the above equation are available in the following table when &quot;p&quot; is in kPa, &quot;V&quot;m is in formula_37, &quot;T&quot; is in K and &quot;R&quot; = 8.314formula_38
===Benedict–Webb–Rubin model===
The BWR equation, 
:formula_39

where &quot;d&quot; is the molar density and where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;α&quot;, and &quot;γ&quot; are empirical constants. Note that the &quot;γ&quot; constant is a derivative of constant &quot;α&quot; and therefore almost identical to 1.

==Thermodynamic expansion work==
The expansion work of the real gas is different than that of the ideal gas by the quantity formula_40.

<text>Joseph Leftwich (28 September 1892 – 28 February 1983), born Joseph Lefkowitz, was a British critic and translator into English of Yiddish literature.

==Biography==

Leftwich was born in the Netherlands. He is known particularly for his 1939 anthology &quot;The Golden Peacock&quot; of Yiddish poetry, and his 1957 biography of Israel Zangwill. He was one of the &#x27;Whitechapel Boys&#x27; group (the others being John Rodker, Isaac Rosenberg and Stephen Winsten) of aspiring young Jewish writers in London&#x27;s East End, in the period roughly 1910–1914. He himself retrospectively coined the name, to include also the artists David Bomberg and Mark Gertler.

Leftwich was a vegetarian and an active patron of the Jewish Vegetarian Society. He wrote biographies of
vegetarian writers for &quot;The Jewish Vegetarian&quot; and an introduction for the book &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, edited by Philip Pick, an anthology of essays on Judaism and vegetarianism.

His daughter Joan married the American writer Joseph McElroy.

<doc id="1268836" wikidata="Q1075125" url="?curid=1268836" title="Quiapo, Manila">
<text>Quiapo () is a district of the city of Manila, in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. Known as the “Old Downtown of Manila&quot;, the district’s most famous landmark is Quiapo Church, a minor basilica enshrining Asia&#x27;s most sacred Black Nazarene image, which has been processed every January in the historic district, attracting millions of devotees from all over the country and region. The historic district is also dotted with numerous heritage sites, ranging from ancestral and heritage houses such as those in Hidalgo Street, museums, art galleries, libraries, historic places of worship such as churches and mosques, historic cinemas, as well as historic parks and streets, many of which have been run over by informal settlers and the construction of shanty houses, as well as buildings built by corporations. Many historic sites were destroyed by both the Japanese and American colonizers during World War II without compensation or aid for reconstruction, while some post-war sites were demolished by certain corporations. In recent years, various heritage organizations, experts, and lawmakers have pushed for the re-vitalization of Quiapo as a heritage zone, including the rebuilding of lost heritage structures, the revamping of modern structures to fit the historic district&#x27;s original aesthetics, as well as the planting of trees and plants and the refurnishing of streets to make the district more safe, walkable, and climate-adaptive.

Geographically located at the very center of the City of Manila, Quiapo is bounded by the Pasig River and Estero de San Miguel to the south, San Miguel district to the east, the districts of Sampaloc and Santa Cruz and Recto Avenue to the north, and the Santa Cruz district and Rizal Avenue to the west.

==Etymology==
Quiapo&#x27;s name is derived from the abundance of water cabbage (&quot;Pistia stratiotes&quot;), called &quot;kiyapo&quot; in Tagalog (spelled &quot;&quot; in Philippine Spanish) in the nearby Pasig River. The town of Cuyapo in Nueva Ecija is also named after the same plant.

== History ==
Pre-1800 maps of Manila show that Quiapo, historically a poor fishing village, was originally a cluster of islands with marshlands and shallow waters. In 1578, Franciscans arrived and established their main missionary headquarters in nearby Santa Ana de Sapa, taking Quiapo as part of its &quot;visita&quot; (chapel-of-ease). They founded Quiapo Church and dedicated it to Saint John the Baptist. The Jesuits later arrived in 1581.

Franciscan prelate Pedro Bautista petitioned to make Quiapo a separate town. The petition was finally granted by Governor-General Santiago de Vera on August 29, 1586. In 1622, Augustinians arrived and founded a chapel in honor of St. Sebastian at the present-day site of the San Sebastian Basilica. By 1850, then a small agricultural village, population of Quiapo grew as a result of a developing economy in the wake of the Manila galleon trade&#x27;s termination and the subsequent opening of the country to world trade in 1830. Newly rich mestizos started settling in Quiapo, as well as many rich Europeans, including Spanish army officers.

Quiapo had become a wealthy suburb. Since the American insular government and commonwealth periods through to the late 1970s, it shared its status as the center of the activities of Manila&#x27;s social elites as well as trade, fashion, art and higher learning with its surrounding vicinity (Avenida Rizal, Santa Cruz, Escolta and the University Belt). However, with the construction of the Manila Light Rail Transit System&#x27;s LRT-1 spanning over Rizal Avenue, the occlusion of light, the trapping of smog and vehicle emissions left the streets beneath dark, gloomy and with an increase in crime and transients. Consequently, many long-time establishments vacated the area. The vibrancy of Quiapo diminished further during the martial law era due to the economic downfall of the country, which caused social unrest. Sections of the district became important in the success of the 1986 People Power Revolution. Open spaces in the district was filled by makeshift markets to accommodate visitors to the Quiapo Church.

== Community ==

Plaza Miranda, in the heart of the Quiapo district, is a town square named after Jose Sandino y Miranda, who served as secretary of the treasury of the Philippines from 1853 to 1863. It is located in front of the Quiapo Church, and has become a popular site for political rallies. On August 21, 1971, while the Liberal Party held its &quot;miting de avance&quot; in the plaza, a bomb exploded, killing nine and injuring almost 100 civilians.

The Quiapo district is also home to a sizable Muslim population. The Golden Mosque and Green Mosque are located here.

Stores offering herbal products, and a large population of self-described fortune tellers, surround the Quiapo church. Thievery and sales of illegally copied media are prevalent in the district.

In recent years, the local government of Manila, spearheaded by then-Mayor Lito Atienza, launched the &quot;Buhayin ang Maynila&quot; (&quot;Revitalize Manila&quot;) project which greatly rehabilitated Quiapo and its vicinities, most especially Plaza Miranda, Quinta Market, the Arsenio Lacson Underpass and the University Belt. Parts of Rizal Avenue, starting from Carriedo Street to Recto Avenue, were converted into pedestrian shopping arcades.

==Heritage Zone and UNESCO==
The district of Quiapo is currently being pushed and debated in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate to be declared as a heritage zone. The declaration and legislation would protect the district&#x27;s numerous heritage sites, from bahay-na-bato structures, the Quiapo Church, San Sebastian Church, the historical universities within it, the Buddhist and Islamic places of worship, and its historical parks and streets, among others. It is also proposed that the district be pushed as a UNESCO World Heritage site once the district has been declared a heritage zone and that the district undergoes renovations and reconstructions that would amplify its heritage zone designation, following guidelines by cultural experts.

In the Senate version of the bill being pushed to recognize Quiapo as a heritage zone, some of the heritage sites recognized included, but not limited to, the following: Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene, Minor Basilica of San Sebastian, Masjid Al-Dahab, Plaza del Carmen, Plaza Miranda, Quinta Market, Nakpil-Bautista House, Paterno House, Zamora House, Estrella House, Genato House, Zaragoza House, Casa Consulado, Ocampo-Santiago House, Ocampo Pagoda Mansion, Padilla Art Gallery, Casa Boix (Boix House), La Estricista Site, Calle Hidalgo (Hidalgo Street), Calle Argelui, Calle Bautista, V. Calle Bilibid Viejo, Calle de Guzman, and Globo de Oro Street. The intangible cultural heritage emanating from the district was also included as part of the heritage zone, such as the religious rituals, fortune telling traditions, and ancient medical practices of the locals.

==Barangays==

Quiapo contains 16 barangays. Barangays 306 to 309 are part of Zone 30 of the City of Manila, while Barangays 383 to 388 are of Zone 39, and Barangays 389 to 394 are of Zone 40.

== Popular culture ==
Quiapo was the plot setting for the 1986 film &quot;Batang Quiapo&quot; and its television adaptation and the episode &quot;Paa&quot; of the 2010 horror film &quot;Cinco&quot;.

In the film &quot;No Other Woman&quot;, Quiapo was referenced as a place where there are lots of snatchers/pickpockets in relation to the protagonist&#x27;s husband&#x27;s affair. The exact quote arguably had become a meme.

<doc id="1268839" wikidata="Q1027820" url="?curid=1268839" title="Skew-T log-P diagram">
<text>A skew-T log-P diagram is one of four thermodynamic diagrams commonly used in weather analysis and forecasting. In 1947, N. Herlofson proposed a modification to the emagram that allows straight, horizontal isobars and provides for a large angle between isotherms and dry adiabats, similar to that in the tephigram. This made the diagram useful for analysis techniques that were then being adopted by the United States Air Force.

Such a diagram has pressure plotted on the vertical axis, with a logarithmic scale (thus the &quot;log-P&quot; part of the name), and the temperature plotted skewed, with isothermal lines at 45° to the plot (thus the &quot;skew-T&quot; part of the name). Plotting a hypothetical set of measurements with constant temperature for all altitudes would result in a line angled 45° to the right. In practice, since temperature usually drops with altitude, the graphs are usually mostly vertical (see examples linked to below).

The major use for skew-T log-P diagrams is the plotting of radiosonde soundings, which give a vertical profile of the temperature and dew point temperature throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The isopleths on the diagram can then be used to simplify many tedious calculations involved, which were previously performed by hand or not at all. Many skew-T log-P diagrams also include a vertical representation of the wind speed and direction using wind barbs. Important atmospheric characteristics such as saturation, atmospheric instability, and wind shear are critical in severe weather forecasting, by which skew-T log-P diagrams allow quick visual analysis. The diagrams are widely used by glider pilots to forecast the strength of thermals and the height of the base of the associated cumulus clouds.

<text>Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno (), officially and liturgically known as Jesús Nazareno, and popularly known as the Black Nazarene (; ), is a life-sized dark statue of Jesus Christ carrying the True Cross. The venerated image is enshrined in the Minor Basilica and National Shrine of Jesus Nazareno in Quiapo, Manila, Philippines.

The image was reputedly carved by an unknown Mexican artist in the 16th century and then brought to the Philippines in 1606. It depicts Jesus en route to his crucifixion.

Pious believers claim that physically touching the image can grant miracles and cure diseases. The original image or its replica is brought out in procession three times a year:

* January 9 — the Feast of the Black Nazarene, the octave day of the traditional Feast of Most Holy Name of Jesus (the original dedication of Quiapo Church). It is now considered a national liturgical feast day. “&quot;Traslación”&quot; is the name of the procession reenacting the transfer of the image from Intramuros.
* Good Friday — commemorating the culmination of the Passion of Jesus. 
* December 31 — New Year’s Eve, marking the start of the novena. It is also called as &quot;Walk of Thanksgiving&quot; or the &quot;Thanksgiving Procession&quot;.

==Name and parts==
The image derives its official name from &quot;Nazarene&quot;, a title of Christ identifying him as a native of Nazareth, along with its dark complexion (unusual for depictions of Jesus, even in the Philippines).

The Roman Catholic Church encourages the image to be called &quot;Jesús Nazareno&quot;. Manila Archbishop Jose Cardinal Advincula issued a decree on October 3, 2024 renaming the host church and the image to &quot;Jesus Nazareno&quot; to &quot;further focus the people on the holy name of our Lord than a color or attribute&quot;.

=== Main carriage ===

The image&#x27;s wooden base is referred to as the &quot;peana&quot; while its carriage or &quot;carroza&quot; used in processions is called the &quot;ándas&quot; (from the Spanish &quot;andar&quot;, &quot;to move forward&quot;). The term &quot;ándas&quot; commonly refers to the shoulder-borne palanquins of religious images, and was retained for the icon&#x27;s carriage which replaced the silver palanquins used until the late 20th century.

=== Composition and main replica ===
There is no singular complete image of the Black Nazarene as there are several images and replicas in different combinations.

* The head of the original venerated image and its original right foot are on the statue enshrined in the high altar called &quot;Venerado&quot;, which has a body made of &quot;molave&quot; wood (&quot;Vitex parviflora&quot; or &quot;Vitex cofassus&quot;). The original cross is attached in this image, however a significant part of it was cut-off and was distributed to devotees during the &quot;400 years&quot; celebration in 2006. 
* The &quot;Vicário&quot; is the replica processional image, used for the annual &quot;Traslación&quot;, as well as the New Year&#x27;s Eve and Good Friday processions and retains the original body torso, with a replica head of &quot;Litsea leytensis&quot; wood (Filipino: &quot;Batikulíng&quot;).
* The original left and right hand of the image, as well as the original left foot, is kept within the Rector&#x27;s office. The original hands are used for blessing people, especially the sick and dying.

=== &quot;Callejeros&quot; ===
Aside from the replica images called &quot;Venerado&quot; and the &quot;Vicário&quot;, the basilica also maintains other replicas of the image called &quot;Callejeros&quot;. These are considered by the shrine as official replicas of the Nazareno which is sent to visit various parishes across the different dioceses in the country. These visits are officially called as &quot;Dalaw Nazareno&quot;. On these visits, the &quot;callejeros&quot; are accompanied by the official standard banner of the Basilica and Shrine and one of the priests assigned in Quiapo Church would go and celebrate mass in the host church.

At present, the shrine has five &quot;Callejero&quot; images: &quot;Uno, Dos, Katorse, Disisiete,&quot; and &quot;Señor Cabeza&quot;. The names of first four images refers to the number of replicas produced for the shrine when it was labeled. The &quot;Señor Cabeza&quot; is a famed image previously maintained by Catholic priest, Father Emmanuel del Rosario of the Diocese of Cubao who also was a devotee of the Black Nazarene. After his death, the image was donated to the church as &quot;callejero&quot; on 26 October 2022.

=== List of authorized replicas ===
The Quiapo Church also donates official replicas of the Nazareno to churches and shrines in the Philippines and abroad to promote and to spread the devotion to the image. Currently, they have donated 34 images to different dioceses and 5 of them were donated outside the Philippines.

==History==
===Original image===

The image was made by an anonymous Mexican sculptor and arrived in Manila via galleon from Acapulco, Mexico. There is no definite date of the arrival of the image. The Augustinian Recollects asserted that during their arrival in the Philippines in 1606, the Nazareno is not one of the sacred images that they brought with them. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that 
the image was already in the Philippines before the 
middle of the 17th century since Pope Innocent X authorized the &quot;Cofradìa del Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno&quot; (Confraternity of the Lord Jesus of 
Nazareth) on April 20, 1650.

Popular belief attributes the colour of the image to soot from votive candles burnt before it, although the most popular legend is that it was charred by a fire on the galleon that brought it from Mexico. Filipino Catholic theologian and church historian Monsignor Sabino Vengco, meanwhile, claims that the image is not charred, but is in fact dark through to its core, being carved from mesquite wood. Vengco based this claim on personal research in Mexico, where he said mesquite wood was a popular medium in the period the image was carved. He also likened it to Our Lady of Antipolo, another popular image of similar provenance and appearance.

The image was first enshrined in the Church of San Juan Bautista of the Augustinian Recollects in Bagumbayan, Luneta. In 1608, the image was transferred to the Church of San Nicolás de Tolentino (popularly known as the &quot;Recoletos Church&quot;) inside Intramuros. It was enshrined in the or high altar of the church, leaving only for a procession on Palm Sunday. Both the church and the image were destroyed in the Allied bombardment of Manila during its liberation in 1945.

===Replica and alleged vandalism ===
During his tenure as Archbishop of Manila in 1767-1787, Archbishop Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa y Rufina ordered the Augustinian Recollect priests the transfer a copy of the image to the Quiapo Church. The reason for this is to give devotees further access to the image and secure the safety of Intramuros from outsiders. Contrary to popular belief that this transfer occurred on 9 January 1787 which became the basis of Feast of the Black Nazarene celebrated by the faithful every January 9 through a procession (the &quot;Traslación&quot;), there is no available historical record to verify the exact date of transfer of the Nazareno from Intramuros to Quiapo.

The venerable image survived numerous fires, earthquakes, and other natural and human-caused calamities, especially the Philippine Revolution, the 1929 fire that destroyed the church, and the bombings of World War II.

In the 1980s, the rector of the Basilica, Rev. Msgr. Jose C. Abriol, feared that the image might be damaged during the Traslación, fire, or natural disaster. He commissioned Gener Maglaqui, a &quot;santero&quot; ( a sculptor of religious images) from Quiapo, to sculpt a replica of the head and body. The original head now sits atop the 1980s body (the &quot;Venerado&quot;), which remains enshrined in church&#x27;s main altar. The 1980s head was placed atop the original body (the &quot;Vicario&quot;). It is this composite combination which is used during major processions.

There is a popular story about a fanatical Iglesia ni Cristo member shot the image&#x27;s left cheek using a gun. It allegedly caused a hysterical commotion that led to the shooter&#x27;s death and left a gunshot mark on the cheek of the Nazareno which has remained unrestored by pious popular demand. However, public historian Xiao Chua interviewed Eugenio “Boy” Jongco, former president of the &quot;Hijos de Nazareno - Central&quot; and a witness of the event, to confirm the story. While he confirmed that there was a commotion and a shooting incident when the procession passed an Iglesia ni Cristo chapel in Concepcion Aguila St. during the mid-1980s, he clarified that the shooting incident was not directed to the image. He further clarified that a gunshot did not cause the hole in the image&#x27;s face. It was a dent in the image ever since it was carved, and it was eventually revealed because of dryness and age over time.

==Description==

The &quot;Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno&quot; wears a braided wig made of dark, dyed abacá, along with a golden Crown of Thorns. Attached to the Crown are the traditional &quot;Tres Potencias&quot; (&quot;three powers&quot;) halo, variously understood as symbolising the three powers of the Holy Trinity; the faculties of will, memory, and understanding in Christ&#x27;s soul; or his &quot;exousia&quot; (authority), &quot;dunamis&quot; (power), and &quot;kratos&quot; (strength). These three &quot;rayos&quot; (&quot;rays&quot;), likely an angular variant of the cruciform halo, are used exclusively for and proper to images of Jesus Christ in traditional Filipino and Hispanic iconography to signify his divinity. The original image has lost several fingers over the centuries.

Jesus is shown barefoot and in a genuflecting posture, symbolising the agony and the weight of the Cross, along with the overall pain Christ endured during his Passion. The Cross itself is of black wood tipped with flat, pyramidal brass caps.

=== Vestments ===
The image is dressed in a heavy velvet tunic of maroon, embroidered with floral and plant designs using gold thread, and trimmed with a matching set of white lace collar and cuffs. Around the waist is a gold-plated metal belt embossed with the word &quot;NAZARENO&quot;, while a golden chain ending in spheres is looped around the neck and held in the left hand, representing the Flagellation of Christ.

The vestments of the image are changed in the rite of &quot;Pabihis&quot; (English: Vesting the image), which is presided over by a Catholic priest vested in an alb, red cope and stole. Devotees watching the ceremony either sit inside the basilica, or follow along outside in Plaza Miranda. The rite comprises with several hymns, the reading of scriptural lessons, the recitation of prayers, and then the blessing of the new vestments. As a sign of modesty and reverence, a curtain is raised to shield the statue from public view as the male attendants called &quot;Hijos&quot; change its vestments, and then it is dropped once the actual changing is complete. The old vestments are folded and presented to the faithful, who queue to kiss and touch these in the belief these bear the image&#x27;s miraculous properties. The rite of vesting is officiated five times a year in preparation for major religious occasions; since 2022, a few of the vesting day rites are also livestreamed online.

== Pontifical approbations ==
* Pope Innocent X approved veneration of the image in 1650 as a sacramental, and authorized the establishment of the Confraternity of the Most Holy Jesus Nazarene (Spanish: &quot;Cofradía de Nuestro Santo Jesús Nazareno&quot;). For most of the Spanish Era, indigenous Filipinos were barred from Holy Orders, while confraternities were groups of laymen and thus an open option for religious life.
* Pope Pius VII granted the image his apostolic blessing in 1880, which granted a plenary indulgence to those who piously pray before the Christological image. 
* Pope John Paul II issued a Pontifical decree which raised the shrine to the status of Minor Basilica on 11 December 1987. The decree was signed and notarized by the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.

==Pious cult and veneration==


Veneration of the &quot;Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno&quot; is rooted among Filipinos who strongly identify with the passion and suffering of Christ the image depicts. Many devotees of the venerated image relate their poverty and daily struggles to the Passion of Christ.

Some believers practice walking in barefoot as a form of piety while others make an effort to ride on the carriage in the belief of obtaining graces from the devotional image. Prior to the Second Vatican Council, procession of the image was relatively solemn and peaceful. The rowdy and massive nature of the procession began in the 1960s as the population grew and greater hype surrounded the image.

While the actual patron saint of the basilica is John the Baptist (making its feast day June 24, concurrent with the secular Manila Day), the Black Nazarene and its &quot;Traslación&quot; are more popular.

At the end of each Mass said in the basilica, devotees pay homage to the image by clapping their hands. In addition to the novena, &quot;Traslación&quot;, &quot;Pahalík&quot;, and the &quot;Pabihis&quot;, the &quot;Pasindí&quot; (&quot;lighting&quot;) or lighting of votive candles is another popular devotion, as is the decades-old, reverential custom of creeping on one&#x27;s knees down the main aisle towards the altar and image.
The Friday of each week in the year (except Good Friday, the image&#x27;s liturgical commemoration) is colloquially known in Metro Manila as &quot;Quiapo Day&quot;, since the novena for the image is held on this day nationwide. As with Wednesday (which is comparably called &quot;Baclaran Day&quot;), this day is associated with heavy traffic around the basilica due to the influx of devotees and pilgrims.

The attached Nazarene Catholic School (formerly the Quiapo Parochial School) reflects the devotion of school authorities; its official newsletter is likewise named &quot;The Nazarene&quot;, with pupils called &quot;Nazareñans.&quot;

The largest annual procession for the &quot;Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno&quot; is the January 9 &quot;Traslación&quot; procession on the Feast of the Black Nazarene, attracting millions of Catholic devotees, who try to touch or get their towel wiped by the image carriers on the image to attain its blessings and power. Along with Santo Niño (Child Jesus), it is the most popular object of devotion in the Philippines. In 2011, over six million Catholic devotees flocked to the Feast of the Black Nazarene.

=== Music ===
The hymn &quot;Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno&quot; was composed by National Artist of the Philippines, Lucio San Pedro to honor the image. It is used by the basilica as the official anthem to the image and associated rites.

The image is also prominently featured on the front cover of Pabasa books, a Lenten manual hymn commemorating the life and Passion of Jesus Christ.

==Claims of indigenous idolatry==
According to the rector of the basilica, Father José Clemente Ignacio, the image&#x27;s procession and devotional practices reflect the &quot;Filipino trait to want to wipe, touch, kiss, or embrace sacred objects if possible&quot;, and reflect an indigenous belief in &quot;the presence of the Divine in sacred objects and places.&quot;

According to Jaime Laya, these practices are a modernized form of indigenous idolatry, a continuation of the pre-Christian practice of revering sacred objects by pious touching (Filipino: &quot;Hipo&quot; / &quot;Himas&quot;). Elizabeth Pisares also states that this is a revised idolatry of pre-colonial times, and suggests its link with social disparities among Filipinos.

According to Mariano Barbato, the debate over the icon comes down to personal interpretations of what constitutes idolatry.

<doc id="1268850" wikidata="Q7293902" url="?curid=1268850" title="Rape kit">
<text>A rape kit or rape test kit is a package of items used by medical, police or other personnel for gathering and preserving physical evidence following an instance or allegation of sexual assault. The evidence collected from the victim can aid the criminal rape investigation and the prosecution of a suspected assailant. DNA evidence can have tremendous utility for sexual assault investigations and prosecution by identifying offenders, revealing serial offenders through DNA matches across cases, and exonerating those who have been wrongly accused.

The kit was developed in Chicago in the mid-1970s, in order to provide a more uniform protocol for evidence collection after sexual assaults. While Louis R. Vitullo is frequently credited as the developer of the first kit, it was originally researched and proposed to Vitullo by Martha &#x27;Marty&#x27; Goddard, who was a victim advocate and founder of Chicago&#x27;s Citizens for Victims Assistance organization, and herself a sexual assault survivor. For years, the standardized tool was referred to as a Vitullo kit. Today it is colloquially referred to as a rape test kit or a rape kit, which are used interchangeably to refer to the specific evidence that is obtained through the use of the rape kit. Other terms and abbreviations used are sexual assault kit (SAK), a sexual assault forensic evidence kit (SAFE), sexual assault evidence collection kit (SAECK), sexual offense evidence collection kit (SOEC) and physical evidence recovery kit (PERK).

==History==
In the 1970s, after the women&#x27;s movement had gained its first traction, and the media began to cover the reporting of rape and other forms of sexual assault, a sexual assault survivor named Martha Goddard embarked upon a crusade to create a comprehensive rape evidence collection kit and lobby for its adoption by law enforcement agencies. The lack of standardized protocol for correctly collecting such evidence, and the lack of understanding of or sympathy for those suffering the psychological trauma of such crimes meant that such evidence, when it was collected, was not preserved in a way that maintained its integrity. Goddard founded the Chicago-based Citizens Committee for Victim Assistance to address the issue, researching the process by consulting with medical professionals, law enforcement officials, members of the justice system, and scholars. Through her friendship with businesswoman Christie Hefner, Goddard acquired funding for the kits from Playboy Foundation, the charity founded by Hefner&#x27;s father, &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner.

The kit was first utilized in September 1978, according to a 1980 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article, when 26 Cook County hospital emergency rooms incorporated its use into their standard practice for gathering trace evidence when treating rape victims. It consisted of a cardboard box containing items including swabs, slides and a small comb, and instructions for using them. Less than two years later, 215 hospitals across Illinois were using it.

The kit became known as &quot;Vitullo kit&quot; after Chicago police sergeant Louis Vitullo, the Chicago crime lab&#x27;s chief microanalyst who worked on high-profile cases. This designation came about at Vitullo&#x27;s insistence because, according to Vitullo&#x27;s colleague, Marian Caporusso, forensic experts had &quot;the final say-so for a lot of the design features.&quot; As a result, the press described the effort to create and implement the kits as a collaboration between Vitullo and Goddard.

Based upon the effective use of the kits in Chicago, New York City adopted Goddard&#x27;s kit system in 1982. In 1984, Goddard gave a presentation about the Chicago pilot project at an FBI conference. Based on her presentation, the Department of Justice provided Goddard with funding to travel to help other states begin their own rape kit pilot programs.

In a 2003 interview, Goddard related that through her work in a Chicago teen crisis center, she learned about the very low rate at which rapes resulted in prosecutions.

==Description and use==
===Kit contents===
A rape kit consists of small boxes, microscope slides and plastic bags for collecting and storing evidence such as clothing fibers, hairs, saliva, blood, semen or body fluid.

Rape kits vary by location, but commonly include the following items:
*Instructions
*Bags and sheets for evidence collection
*Swabs for collecting fluids from the lips, penile opening, cheeks, thighs, vagina, anus, and buttocks
*Sterile urine collection containers
*Sterile sample containers
*Blood collection devices
*Comb used to collect hair and fiber from the victim&#x27;s body
*Clear glass slides
*Self-sealing envelopes for preserving the victim&#x27;s clothes, head hair, pubic hair, and blood samples
*Nail pick for scraping debris from beneath the nails
*White sheets to catch physical evidence stripped from the body
*Documentation forms
*Labels
*Sterile water and saline

===Examiners===
Rape kit examinations are performed by medical professionals, most commonly physicians and nurses. In some locations, examiners have received special training on performing sexual assault forensic exams. For example, many hospitals and health facilities in the United States and Canada have Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) who are trained to collect and preserve forensic evidence and to offer emotional support to the victim. According to the International Association of Forensic Nurses, the number of SANE programs has steadily increased throughout the world since its introduction in the United States in the 1970s. As of 2016, over 700 SANE programs exist in the United States, Canada, and Australia. SANEs were introduced in the United Kingdom in 2001. Japan has had a limited number of SANEs since as early as 2007.

===Evidence collection===
The process of collecting a rape kit is highly invasive and extremely time-consuming. The physical examination begins with the victim disrobing while standing on a large sheet of butcher paper, which collects any trace evidence that may fall from the victim&#x27;s body or clothes. The victim&#x27;s clothing is carefully examined for trace evidence before each garment is individually packaged with sheets of paper between folds to protect against cross-contamination.

Examiners then collect biological samples of semen, blood, saliva and other bodily fluids by swabbing the victim&#x27;s genitals, rectum, mouth and body surfaces. Examiners also collect fingernail scrapings and pluck head and pubic hairs. If the facility has the means, and the victim consents, the examiner will also take photographs of genital injuries using a colposcope.

In addition to facilitating the collection of biological samples and injuries, the kit guides the documentation of the victim&#x27;s medical history, emotional state, and account of the assault. The entire process of collecting the rape kit takes between 2.5 and 5 hours to complete. While the exam is going on, the victim has the right at any point to ask questions or stop the examination completely.

===Testing===
Upon completion, the rape kit is sealed and typically transferred to local law enforcement. In the United States, if the victim is undecided about reporting the rape, the kit may instead be stored at the exam facility or a law enforcement facility as an &quot;anonymous&quot; kit.

The law enforcement agency conducting the rape investigation can send the rape kit, in whole or in part, to the forensic science crime lab for analysis. Forensic scientists will try to develop a DNA profile of the assailant using the samples collected in the rape kit. If successful, the crime lab will search the DNA profile against the DNA profiles of convicted offenders and other crime scenes using a DNA database. For example, crime labs in the United States run DNA profiles through the three-tiered Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which was developed in 1990 and contains DNA profiles at the national, state, and local levels. Similarly, the need to solve sexual assault crimes in Brazil led the Forensic DNA Research Institute of Federal District Civil Police to create a DNA database in 1998 containing evidence specifically collected in sexual assault cases. DNA matches in such databases not only aid in identifying the assailant where unknown to the victim, but also may help determine whether the assailant (known or unknown to the victim) is a serial rapist. These findings eventually may be made available for use in court.

In some cases, the rape kit does not yield DNA evidence and the forensic scientist is unable to develop a DNA profile of the assailant. This may be because the assailant did not leave DNA behind, or too much time passed before the victim had a rape kit exam performed, or the rape kit evidence may have been improperly collected, stored or handled. Due to the backlog of sexual assault cases, forensic scientists have been challenged with the task of determining how to process the sexual assault kits effectively and within the statute of limitation on assaults.

Damaged evidence is something that is common among rape kits because survivors of sexual assault typically desire to wash themselves as soon as possible following an attack. Prior to the exam, it is desired that patients avoid using the rest room, combing their hair, bathing, changing their clothes or cleaning up the scene of the assault. Most evidence needs to be collected within 72 hours to be viable, and patients are advised to either bring or wear the clothing they had on when attacked to the exam.

==Influence on sexual assault cases==
Rape kit evidence can aid the criminal rape investigation and the prosecution of a suspected assailant. It may also be used to exonerate the wrongly accused. The benefit of rape kit evidence depends in part on the character of the assault.

===Stranger cases===
In stranger sexual assault cases, the assailant is unknown to the victim. In such cases, rape kits may be instrumental in identifying the assailant through DNA profiling, which research suggests may help lead to an arrest. For example, a 2009 study examining sexual assault cases from two of 389 crime laboratories in the United States found that stranger-rape cases with forensic evidence were 24 times more likely to produce an arrest than stranger-rape cases without forensic evidence.

Stranger cases can take a longer time to identify the perpetrator because without forensic evidence, the case becomes significantly more difficult to prosecute. This is one of the main problems that many victims face when coming forward that they had been raped.

===Acquaintance rape===
The vast majority of sexual assaults are non-stranger (or &quot;acquaintance&quot;) cases where the victim knows the assailant. While identifying a suspect is not at issue, the kit&#x27;s forensic evidence can be used to confirm offender identity in acquaintance rape cases. The kits may also be used to determine whether the offender committed other crimes.

In many acquaintance sexual assault cases, the accused assailant will defend the accusations as consensual encounters. In such cases, rape kit evidence that documents the victim&#x27;s injuries, e.g., photographs of bruising, is a useful tool to corroborate allegations of non-consensual sexual contact. In cases where the victim suffers a serious injury, filing charges and reaching convictions is more likely.

In other acquaintance cases, the assailant may deny that sexual intercourse occurred at all. In such cases, specimens that show either sperm or specific enzymes that are unique to seminal fluid (enzymes prostatic acid phosphates or acid phosphatase) can be used to prove sexual contact.

===Serial rape cases===
Serial rape is defined as an assailant that has raped two or more victims. Serial rape may involve sexual partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, and it may be in the same family, in the same or different regions of a city, or in different cities or states. DNA collected by rape kits can help lead to identifying and arresting a person guilty of serial rape.

In both stranger and non-stranger sexual assault cases, DNA testing of rape kit evidence and DNA database hits help identify serial sexual assaults. For example, a 2016 study of 900 previously untested rape kits in Detroit, Michigan found 259 CODIS hits, which included stranger and non-stranger sexual assault DNA profiles. Sixty-nine of the hits were serial sexual assault hits, 15 of which were acquaintance (non-stranger) sexual assault cases.

In a study analyzing the status of Brazil&#x27;s DNA database in 2015, researchers found 223 matches related to 78 serial rapists. At the time, the DNA database contained 650 profiles from one type of analysis of samples collected in rape kits—male autosomal STR profiles—and 420 profiles from a second type of analysis—complete 23Y-STR profiles.

==Barriers to use==
===Backlog===

Rape kit backlog refers to the problem of untested sexual assault kits. The problem is twofold: it involves both the issue of rape kits not being submitted to crime labs for testing and the related issue of crime labs not having enough resources to test all of the submitted kits.

One cause of the backlog of rape kits being tested is detectives and/or prosecutors failing to request a DNA analysis. When someone fails to request a DNA analysis, the kit sits in a police evidence storage facility untested. A rape kit is considered backlogged when it is not submitted for analysis within 10 days of the evidence being submitted. A second cause of the backlog is crime laboratory facilities receiving the rape kits and not testing them in a timely manner. The Joyful Heart Foundation, an anti-sexual violence charity founded by actress and activist Mariska Hargitay, considers these kits backlogged when the kit is not analyzed within 30 days of it being sent to the lab.

Conservative estimates indicate there are 200,000–400,000 untested rape kits in U.S. police departments, and large stockpiles of kits have been documented in over five dozen jurisdictions, sometimes totaling more than 10,000 untested rape kits in a single city. The federal DNA Initiative has helped state as well as local governments to increase the ability of their DNA laboratories and decrease backlogs. The actual number of untested rape kits is undefined because there is no nationwide system set up to keep track of the cases. This can be attributed to the lack of a common definition of backlog, which can relate to cases not worked within a month of submission, or cases that have not been submitted to the forensic labs for analysis.

===Destruction===

In some locations, rape kits are destroyed before ever being tested and sometimes without notifying the victim. For victims of sexual assault in the United States, for example, the length of time for which a kit can go untested may be shorter than the statute of limitations. Policies in some jurisdictions, such as Massachusetts, instruct that rape kits be destroyed as early as six months after they are initially stored. A 2016 &quot;HuffPost&quot; report stated that it was not uncommon for labs to dispose of untested kits, sometimes illegally, in Colorado, Kentucky and North Carolina. As of 2016, no U.S. state provides a right to retain a rape kit until the expiration of the statute of limitations, and only six states and Washington, D.C., provide a right for the prompt testing of a kit. By contrast, the shortest statute of limitations in the US is three years, though many states do not have a statute of limitations for rape. Some states, including Washington and Idaho, have legislation in place that requires a tracking system allowing law enforcement, medical facilities, and survivors to check the status of kits throughout the entire process, from collection to analysis and final disposition, and for survivors to be notified if a decision is made not to test a kit or to its destruction.

===Inaccessibility===
Victims&#x27; access to rape kits is often limited. In many locations, the non-availability of rape kits prevents victims from obtaining medico-legal evidence that would otherwise aid in the criminal investigation and prosecution of their assailant. In Nigeria, for example, a study analyzing sexual assault in Ile-Ife found that the majority of victims went to the hospital within 24 hours of a sexual assault, but did not receive a forensic medical examination because rape kits have yet to be introduced in the country.

In locations where rape kits are available, a lack of trained examiners may still impede the ability of victims to undergo timely sexual assault examinations. Shortages force victims to wait hours for an exam or to travel long distances in order to have a rape kit performed within the recommended 72 hour timeframe. These effects have been seen in Canada and rural areas in the United States, where the shortage of examiners has recently been identified.

Insufficiently trained examiners may also lead to deficiencies in rape kits. A study of rape kit collection in South Africa found that rape kits were sometimes inappropriately used, missing proper specimens, or missing necessary forms. The study recommended improved training of health care workers to overcome these deficiencies.

===Cost===
The cost of rape kits is a barrier to use in many locations where the victim is billed for the collection of forensic evidence. Collecting a rape kit reportedly costs upwards of $1,000. In some countries, reimbursement for the cost is contingent on the victim reporting the crime to police. In Japan, for example, a sexual assault victim must pay for the rape kit upfront, but police will reimburse medical fees if the victim reports the assault.

Victims of sexual assault in the United States faced similar hurdles until the 2005 reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which requires states to pay for the cost of the rape kit regardless of the victim&#x27;s decision to report the assault to the police. Under the more recent 2013 VAWA reauthorization, which took effect in March 2015, victims also cannot be required to pay the upfront cost of the exam. States may still require victims to submit claims for the rape kit exams to their personal insurance providers, as long as they are not billed for a deductible or a copay. In the United States, several organizations have pledged millions of dollars in grants to help fund the analysis of rape kits in forensic laboratories.
==By country==

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, victims of rape and sexual assault receive a forensic exam in a Sexual Assault Treatment Unit (SATU). Evidence is sent to Forensics Science Ireland (FSI), based in the Phoenix Park. At the end of 2018, there was a backlog of 70 cases, and it was taking up to a year for results to be released.

===United States===
In the United States, rape kit costs, availability, proper implementation of the invasive exam, and backlogs have historically presented problems for victims of rape seeking justice.

As of May 2009 the federal Violence Against Women Act of 2005 went into effect, requiring state governments who wish to continue receiving federal funding to pay for &quot;Jane Doe rape kits&quot; or &quot;anonymous rape tests&quot;. These tests allow victims too traumatized to go to the police to undergo the procedure at hospitals. The hospitals maintain the collected evidence in a sealed envelope identified only by a number, unless police access its contents upon the victim&#x27;s decision to press charges. While the practice had been recommended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation since at least 1999, and was already followed at some health clinics, colleges and hospitals, and in the state of Massachusetts, many jurisdictions up until then refused to pay the estimated $800 cost of the rape examination without a police report filed by the victim.

In 2011, the National Institute of Justice published a report, &quot;The Road Ahead: Unanalyzed Evidence in Sexual Assault Cases&quot;, providing an overview of deep problems nationwide and the contributing factors to ongoing bureaucratic difficulties. These backlogs and delays may lead to a lack of justice for victims, the report notes, and &quot;in worst-case scenarios...lead to additional victimization by serial offenders or the incarceration of people wrongly convicted of a crime&quot;. Findings include:

# As an indicator of how widespread this problem has become, &quot;18 percent of unsolved alleged sexual assaults that occurred from 2002 to 2007 contained forensic evidence that was still in police custody (not submitted to a crime lab for analysis)&quot;
# One major challenge is that 43% of law enforcement agencies &quot;do not have a computerized system for tracking forensic evidence, either in their inventory or after it is sent to the crime lab&quot;
# On average, 50–60% of kits test positive for biological material that does not belong to the victim
# Survey responses indicated that there may be some misunderstanding of the value of biological evidence. Forty-four percent of the law enforcement agencies said that one of the reasons they did not send evidence to the lab was that a suspect had not been identified. Fifteen percent said that they did not submit evidence because &quot;analysis had not been requested by a prosecutor&quot;.

The federal government established the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) to share DNA matches among federal, state and local jurisdictions. The federal DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and Debbie Smith Act authorizations in 2004 and 2008 provide additional funding to state and local jurisdictions to help clear their rape kit testing backlogs. As of 2014, the federal government estimates a nationwide backlog of 400,000 rape kits, including many from the 1990s when evidence was collected but not tested for DNA due to high costs and more primitive techniques available at the time.

====By state====
=====California=====
According to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch, Los Angeles, California has the largest known rape kit backlog in the United States, with at least 12,669 languishing in storage facilities of the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and 47 independent police departments in Los Angeles County, and &quot;smaller, but not inconsiderable&quot; backlogs residing at police crime labs. These backlogs consist of both kits stored in evidence storage facilities, for which DNA analysis is not requested by investigating detectives, and those submitted for testing at crime lab facilities, but which have not been tested in a timely manner. Although authorities have struggled to address the backlog problem, their attempts have reportedly been hampered by funding issues and politics. As a consequence of these backlogs, assault survivors are often not informed of the status of their rape kit or their case.

=====Illinois=====
Across Illinois, where law enforcement and prosecutors handle sex crimes differently, a police backlog of nearly 8,000 rape kits accumulated between 1995 and 2009, only 20% of which were tested. Effective September 1, 2010, The Illinois Senate&#x27;s Sexual Assault Submissions Act (Senate Bill 3269) requires law enforcement agencies to submit all evidence collected by rape kits for laboratory analysis within 180 days after the effective date of October 15, 2010, with a written notice to the State Police. Illinois was the first state to adopt such a law, setting a precedent for other states to follow. As of January 1, 2011, the Illinois House of Representatives Bill 5976 addresses victims&#x27; confidentiality rights and the timely processing of rape kit evidence. Both bills passed the Illinois General Assembly unanimously, and were signed by Governor Pat Quinn.

=====New York=====
In New York State, a rape kit is also known as Sexual Offense Evidence Collection (SOEC) kit. As of 1999, New York City in particular held nearly 17,000 untested rape kits, which were eventually eliminated with outside labs. In 2007, the city opened a $290 million forensic biology lab. In 2015, the New York County District Attorney&#x27;s Office announced that they would be awarding $38 million in grants to jurisdictions across the country in order to test backlogged rape kits.

=====Texas=====
In Texas, it is considered unnecessary to administer a rape kit after 72 hours following the attack, as it is considered unlikely for useful evidence to be collected, though other types of evidence may still be documented during the medical examination, such as survivor statements, and visible injuries such as bruises, lacerations or bite marks, through visual inspection, photographs and transcription.

=====Washington, D.C.=====
In Washington, D.C., prior to the Violence Against Women Act, which went into effect in 2009, rape kits, despite being standard issue in hospitals, have historically been difficult to obtain, according to an April 2009 report by the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;. According to the report, rape survivors historically waited up to 12 hours in D.C. emergency rooms while the OB-GYNs present would attend to more immediate emergencies, such as births, after which the invasive exam would be performed by inexperienced residents, who made poor witnesses at trial. The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program was established in 2000 at Howard University Hospital in order to address this concerns, after a decade of attempts by Denise Snyder, executive director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (DCRCC), to find a major hospital willing to host the program, most of whom either cited economic concerns or declined to respond to her inquiries. After Howard University adopted the program, survivors encountered the problem of requiring police authorization before receiving a rape examination, which Snyder attributes to a desire to maintain low crime rates on the part of law enforcement agencies, whom, according to the &quot;Washington Paper&quot;, tend to be unsympathetic to alleged rape victims. Detective Vincent Spriggs, of D.C. Metro P.D.&#x27;s Sexual Assault Unit, cites instances of false or unconvincing rape accusations, and requests for rape kits by women who wish to have pregnancy tests or the morning-after pill administered, as an obstacle to more open use of the kits. In 2008, Howard University canceled the SANE program, after which it reopened under the supervision of the mayor&#x27;s office.

==Depictions in media==
The problem of rape kit backlogs was employed as a significant plot point in &quot;Behave&quot;, the September 29, 2010 episode of the television crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, which depicts the operations of a police sex crimes unit. In the episode, detectives investigate the case of a woman, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, who has been raped multiple times by the same man over the course of fifteen years. Their investigation leads them to discover that the perpetrator has raped women all over the United States. The detectives attempt to contact the Special Victims Units in other cities, only to discover that most of them have never tested the majority of their collected rape kits. The episode was based on the real-life story of advocate and survivor Helena Lazaro.

<text>Emanuel (Mannie) Ruben Piore (19 July 1908 – 9 May 2000) was a scientist and a manager of industrial research.

Piore was born on 19 July 1908 in Vilnius, Lithuania to a Jewish family. In 1917, his family moved to the United States, and in 1924, Emanuel Piore became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Piore obtained an undergraduate and a PhD degree in physics, both from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He worked at the Radio Corporation of America, the US Navy (where he became the first civilian to head the Office of Naval Research) and, subsequently, the Avco Manufacturing Corporation, before being hired as the first Director of Research of IBM.

Under his direction, the architect Eero Saarinen designed and build the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center at Yorktown Heights, New York. As Director of Research at IBM he encouraged basic research and the building up of a patent portfolio. He also established the IBM Fellow program, which allowed top researchers to pursue their own interests for a period of time. He was promoted to vice president and group executive, and Chief Scientist and served IBM as a member of the board of directors and of the advisory committee to the board. In 1967, his leadership at IBM was recognized by the Industrial Research Institute when it awarded him the illustrious IRI Medal.

In 1976, the IEEE established the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award, for &quot;outstanding achievement in the field of information processing&quot;. Piore was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. His daughter, Jane Piore Gilman, is a distinguished professor of mathematics at Rutgers University. His son, Michael J. Piore is a professor of economics and political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<doc id="1268855" wikidata="Q5154774" url="?curid=1268855" title="Community High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)">
<text>Community High School (CHS) is a public, magnet high school serving grades 9–12 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the United States. Located on a site at 401 North Division Street near the city&#x27;s Kerrytown district, CHS today enrolls approximately 450 students.

Established in 1972, CHS was one of the first public magnet schools in the country, offering students a smaller alternative to the city&#x27;s three large comprehensive high schools. It is one of the few surviving institutions among the wave of experimental high schools that were founded across the United States in the 1970s.

Unlike many public alternative schools in other cities, CHS is not restricted to a particular student population (such as &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;underachieving&quot; students), nor does it explicitly emphasize one particular area of study over others. Founded on an experimental &quot;school-without-walls&quot; concept, CHS continues to offer opportunities to interact with the surrounding community, primarily through its open campus and its Community Resources Program, an avenue for students to design their own courses for credit through experiential learning projects in the Ann Arbor area. In contrast to many traditional high schools, CHS has been known for its small size, its open campus and down to earth student participation in school governance and staff hiring, and loose attendance policies more similar to those of colleges than those at most high schools. The school has also eschewed many of the characteristics of traditional high schools, including interscholastic sports programs, valedictorians, dress codes, detention, hall passes, changing bells, mascots (aside from a rainbow-spangled zebra).

==Early history==
By the early 1970s, Ann Arbor had developed a reputation as one of the most liberal campus towns in the country. The city played host to numerous radical political organizations, eventually electing three members of the left-wing Human Rights Party to its city council. Meanwhile, the teenage group Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor was carving out a role as a national pioneer in the nascent youth rights movement, with fifteen-year-old member Sonia Yaco&#x27;s insurgent school-board candidacy earning her 1,300 write-in votes, or eight percent of the total, in spring 1972. Reflecting this non-traditional ethos, the city&#x27;s school district opened two experimental alternative schools during those years: Earthworks (originally Pioneer II) in fall 1971, and Community High School (CHS) in fall 1972.

The Community High idea, according to the 1972 blueprint, was to use the city as classroom – thereby creating a &quot;school without walls&quot; where students could develop their own curricula by drawing on experiences and resource people throughout the community. Although the concept was new to Ann Arbor, planners took inspiration from similar innovative programs then springing up in other cities, including the Chicago High School for Metropolitan Studies (est. 1969), Philadelphia&#x27;s Parkway High School, and Washington, D.C.&#x27;s School Without Walls (est. 1971). Reflecting the liberal educational philosophy of the period, other goals in the early CHS proposals were &quot;to provide an opportunity for a heterogeneous group of students and faculty to learn and work together and to combat prejudices based on race, sex, age, lifestyle, and school achievement,&quot; and &quot;to foster the development of identity and responsibility.&quot; The plan emphasized placing students of all grades in the same classes and programs, and had at its heart the Community Resources Program and the Forum Program, small units of students integrated by age, sex and race which would provide home bases for counseling and cultural-studies work.

CHS opened in September 1972, after a $100,000 renovation to an empty downtown building (constructed in 1925) that had formerly housed Jones Elementary School, a majority African-American school which was closed in 1965 due to re-districting for racial-desegregation purposes. Although members of the school board proposed naming classrooms after Ann Arborites who had been killed in the Vietnam War, these plans angered local citizens and teachers who opposed the war, and were never implemented.

The school&#x27;s first dean, Dean Bodley, told the &quot;Ann Arbor News&quot; that the school&#x27;s only formal rules would be two safety precautions: &quot;no smoking except in the student-teacher lounge and persons must wear shoes&quot; – although even these were quickly abandoned. The first commencement, held at the nearby St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church, banished caps and gowns, valedictorians and salutorians of traditional graduation ceremonies. The community-based education concept flourished during CHS&#x27;s first several years, with students developing 569 Community Resource courses in the Ann Arbor community during the fall of 1974 alone. Within the school itself, unorthodox course offerings included subjects as diverse as dream analysis and Eastern philosophy. A 1974 analysis of the school by University of Michigan researchers noted that &quot;[o]verall autonomy in CHS is high&quot;, and concluded that &quot;CHS is an organization dedicated to the development of humanistic principles... &#x27;Maximum individuality within maximum community&#x27; could well be its banner.&quot;

Through the 1970s, enrollment remained in the high 300s. Dr. R. Wiley Brownlee, a civil-rights activist and former principal of Willow Run High School in Michigan, became CHS dean in the school&#x27;s second year. In his time at Willow Run High, Brownlee had taken a conciliatory approach to mounting racial tensions at the school, an approach that eventually cost him his job. His insistence on fair treatment for minority students had also propelled him into national headlines when, in 1971, he was assaulted at gunpoint, then tarred and feathered, by members of the Michigan Ku Klux Klan following a Willow Run school-board meeting. In 1974, shortly after taking the reins at Ann Arbor&#x27;s Community High, Brownlee characterized the student body as sixty-percent &quot;high achievers who are politically disenchanted&quot; and forty-percent students who were &quot;academically disenchanted&quot;.

In October 1973, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described Community High&#x27;s efforts to overcome what CHS counselor Andrades Smith called &quot;widespread and commonly practiced&quot; sexism in the hiring of teachers, career counseling of students, and classroom curricula. As the &quot;Journal&quot; reported, &quot;Partly as a result of pressure brought by militant feminists both inside and outside the school system, training seminars for teachers were organized earlier this year to explore subtle and overt sex discrimination at Community High.&quot; These consciousness-raising workshops, which included talks by female professionals and &quot;role reversals&quot; of traditional sex roles, served as model for a program adopted the following year throughout the Ann Arbor school system.

In 1975, CHS became the first alternative school in Michigan to receive accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation officials, according to news reports, were mildly taken aback by the school&#x27;s eccentricities, questioning the lack of any non-smoking area within the school and some students&#x27; practice of bringing their pets to school.

==Merger with Earthworks==

Through the mid-1970s, CHS was not the only alternative high school in Ann Arbor. Earthworks High School, a smaller school with an even more experimental culture, had been founded as &quot;Pioneer II&quot; in 1971. The school was initially an offshoot of Pioneer High School, one of the city&#x27;s two (at the time) large traditional schools, and it eventually was merged with CHS.

Largely student-driven, the 1971 Earthworks proposal declared that students must be equipped &quot;to function creatively, contributively, responsibly and happily in a world whose central characteristic is radical change,&quot; a task at which traditional institutions were allegedly failing. Students and teachers explained that they sought to depart from &quot;the authoritarian model of teaching&quot;, where teachers are considered &quot;imparters of knowledge&quot; who are seldom mistaken. The school board approved the project despite a rebuke from the board of Ann Arbor&#x27;s Roman Catholic St. Thomas School (now Gabriel Richard), which called the plan &quot;discriminatory by giving support to one group looking for alternatives.&quot;

Diversity proved one of the main stumbling blocks. Before the program opened, some citizens attacked the school board for not considering minority issues, and in the first year, only five students were of minority background (three African American, and two Asian). Difficulties aside, Earthworks opened in October 1971 with 108 students choosing to attend. The school operated in a three-room building at 995 North Maple Road, the former site of Fritz Elementary School, now furnished with rugs and mattresses instead of desks and chairs.

Operating under &quot;free-school&quot; principles, Earthworks students selected their own teachers from among those at the sponsoring Pioneer High School. In addition to three full-time teachers and one administrator, they recruited about a dozen tutors from the University of Michigan, as well as fifty supporting resource people in the community. During the first two weeks of operation, students and teachers worked together in a series of meetings and &quot;rap sessions&quot; to develop a curriculum – one that centered on allowing students to control their own education, work at their own speed, and follow their own interests; and which utilized &quot;contracts&quot; setting out individual student goals and methods to achieve them. As the &quot;Huron Valley Advisor&quot; explained, subjects ranged &quot;from geometry, algebra, and American history to Russian literature, organic gardening and parapsychology (witchcraft) – which is taught by a student.&quot; Some in the traditional schools derided Earthworks as &quot;a hippy kindergarten&quot;. But a 1972 &quot;Ann Arbor News&quot; survey reported that students were pleased with the freedom, power, emphasis on individuality, and ability to control their own educations, although a few disliked the school&#x27;s unorganized nature and felt that some students failed to thrive with the radical lack of structure.

By the end of 1977, enrollment at Earthworks was down to fifty students, with two full-time teachers. Feeling that the program would complement that at Community High, the school board merged the two high schools in 1978, despite qualms from many in each program that the Earthworks identity would be lost in the merger, and that CHS would grow too large. After its absorption, Earthworks became the name of a separate educational track at CHS, and the program continued to run through the late 1990s as a multidisciplinary experiential-learning class emphasizing community activism.

==Community High in the 1980s and 1990s==

Through the 1980s, Community High&#x27;s programs continued on much as they had in the heady days of the 1970s, even as the experimental educational philosophies of the 1970s receded elsewhere in the state and the nation. During this decade, the school had a much lower profile in Ann Arbor, and it was often stereotyped as a haven for misfits or drug users, with its detractors affixing unflattering nicknames such as &quot;Commie High&quot; or &quot;Community Get-High School&quot;. This bad reputation meant that anyone who wanted or needed to be there could do so, and it became a haven, instead, for students with a strong desire to create their own educational direction. It was known as a place with no cliques, and by the seventeenth year of its existence, there had been a grand total of two physical confrontations between students in the school&#x27;s entire history. During the 1991–92 academic year, CHS temporarily moved to alternate facilities at Stone School in eastern Ann Arbor while its downtown building was renovated and expanded. The year was marred by a series of conflicts that arose between CHS students and students in adult-education programs already located at Stone School, and the alternate location made it difficult to maintain programs that depended on CHS&#x27;s downtown setting. Still, through the 1980s the school continued to draw a steady stream of enthusiastic applicants dissatisfied with the strictures of the city&#x27;s traditional high schools.

By 1990, however, CHS had emerged from its status as a quirky, largely unknown alternative, on the road to becoming one of the most desirable and high-profile educational options in the area. In 1989, the school had its first-ever waiting list for students, and through the mid- and late 1990s its growing popularity and unorthodox approach once again drew statewide media coverage. CHS also began to attract attention in the municipal political arena, eventually becoming one of the main issues in Ann Arbor&#x27;s contentious school-board election of June 1994.

===School-board election of 1994===

In 1994, CHS found itself at the center of a bitter and divisive school-board election. Following the 1993 passage of a Michigan state referendum capping local property taxes, money for schools had grown tighter. At the same time, the city&#x27;s two traditional high schools faced mounting problems with overcrowding.

The conservative education group Citizens for Better Education (CBE), which had held a 6–3 majority on the Ann Arbor school board since 1991, favored the city&#x27;s traditional high schools and a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; educational approach. With student populations increasing dramatically in size at the traditional high schools, CBE board members questioned both the small size and higher per-pupil spending at CHS. They proposed expanding the school by 100-200 students, and equalizing its per-pupil expenditures with those at the city&#x27;s larger schools. Proponents of alternative education countered that expanding the student body so drastically would destroy the school&#x27;s intimate ethos, and that the higher per-pupil spending resulted from CHS offering many classroom places, uncompensated, to students from other high schools who commuted for one or two classes. However, their proposal for a new alternative school to take pressure off the existing high schools was quashed by the board&#x27;s conservative majority.

The June 1994 school-board election thus hinged, in large measure, on the alternative-schools issue. A liberal slate of candidates known as New Challenge took on the three CBE incumbents up for re-election, mobilizing heavy support from Community High parents and students. Two of New Challenge&#x27;s three candidates—Diane Hockett, Nicholas Roumel, and Ann Lyzenga—were current or recent CHS parents. Meanwhile, students at the school formed a political action committee called Ann Arbor Students for Political Action (AASPA) that contributed $1,313 and many hours of volunteer time to New Challenge efforts. The student PAC, according to state officials, was the first in Michigan formed by teenagers to influence a local race, and it garnered regional press coverage in the process. Though AASPA began as a class project at CHS, it grew to include 150 high school students, representing all three public Ann Arbor high schools of the time.

CBE incumbents criticized the CHS student group – one decrying it in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; as &quot;narrow-minded, with a narrow focus&quot;, another claiming that &quot;Community High is not going to be the moving force in this town.&quot; The race was one of the most heated and expensive in the city&#x27;s history, with the two slates running cable TV ads (a first for Ann Arbor school elections); the New Challenge ad was produced by another CHS parent volunteer, film/video professional Dave Anderson. The two opposing campaigns spent a combined $32,000, more than in any previous campaign. In the end, New Challenge swept to victory, defeating all three CBE incumbents and assuring the continuance of Community High School in its existing format. The new, more liberal school-board majority soon revived plans to establish another alternative school, known simply as &quot;The New School&quot;, although that project was curtailed in 2000 after four difficult years of operation.

===Enrollment battles===

From 1989 to the present, CHS has attracted far more applicant students than it can accommodate. The process for choosing which students may attend, determined by the school board, eventually reached farcical levels. A lottery was used in 1992, but in March 1993 a first-come/first-served method produced a twenty-four-hour line-up on the school&#x27;s front lawn. In 1995, the line formed three days ahead of time; in 1996, the method produced a two-week line-up outside the school district&#x27;s administration building, complete with mobile homes, portable toilets, roving television news crews, and sardonic editorial cartoons in the local press.

In May 1991, the school board had agreed that black students on the waiting list would receive priority, in order to boost CHS&#x27;s relatively low numbers of African Americans. But many CHS students charged that the first-come/first-served admissions method of the mid-1990s was producing a less diverse student body, one composed of teenagers whose parents (or, in several cases, parents&#x27; secretaries) could afford to take many days off from work to hold down positions in line. The return to the lottery procedure in 1997, however, eliminated the frantic annual queuing ritual. By the early 2000s the number of applications was still growing each year, with approximately three students applying for each of the 108 slots for incoming freshmen. It should also be noted that Ann Arbor high school students who are not accepted into Community High School by way of raffle may still attend the school part-time as a dual enrolled student. Dual enrolled students are primarily enrolled in classes at one of Pioneer, Huron, or Skyline High School, but school bus shuttles commute these students back and forth from Community High School at various times during the school day. As such, most students who dual enroll take 2 or 3 courses at Community High School, and the rest at their primary high school. Despite the enrollment-procedure changes, the school remains less racially diverse than the city&#x27;s two large traditional schools. Approximately 15.2 percent of the CHS student body came from racial-minority backgrounds as of 2005, compared with 29.1 at Pioneer High and 40.8 percent at Huron High, making CHS, as former Dean Peter Ways wrote in 2007, &quot;one of the least diverse schools in Ann Arbor.&quot;

Over the past decade, a number of local critics have argued that the high number of applications for CHS student slots suggested serious weaknesses at the city&#x27;s traditional high schools. But, to the extent that applicants are motivated by overcrowding at the city&#x27;s other schools, the problem was expected to be ameliorated following the opening of Skyline High School, a third traditional school, in 2008. The class of 2009 had the second-highest ACT scores in the state of Michigan. As one of the school&#x27;s many Community Resource Program offerings, Ann Arbor-based Google AdWords developed a class for CHS students in 2007. In 2008, planners in Albuquerque, New Mexico, filed an application to open a charter school in that city, named Ray of Hope High School, which would be &quot;modeled after Community High School in Ann Arbor&quot; and developed through intensive research visits to CHS.

<doc id="1268877" wikidata="Q4722044" url="?curid=1268877" title="Alfonso J. Cervantes">
<text>Alfonso Juan Cervantes (August 27, 1920 – June 23, 1983) was the 39th Mayor of St. Louis, Missouri, from 1965 to 1973.

== Personal life and early political career ==
Born in St. Louis, Cervantes attended St. Louis University High School and Saint Louis University before serving in the Merchant Marine during World War II. He married the former Carmen Davis, and they had six children. Cervantes&#x27; political career began in 1949 when he was elected to the St. Louis Board of Aldermen representing the 15th Ward. He was reelected to that position in 1953 and 1957. In 1955 he was unsuccessful in a citywide bid for President of the Board of Aldermen. He was elected to that post in 1959, but was defeated in a bid for reelection in 1963.

== Term as mayor ==
In 1965, Cervantes challenged incumbent Mayor Raymond Tucker, who was seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office. He defeated Tucker by a vote of 83,698 to 68,379. A third candidate, John Noel, received 1,087 votes. Mr. Cervantes won election as Mayor in the April 6, 1965 City election, over Republican Maurice R. Zumwalt, by a vote of 102,961 to 47,510.

During his term as mayor, Cervantes focused in particular on the issues of race relations, crime-fighting, and city finance. While many other large cities suffered through race riots during the late 1960s, the peace was kept in St. Louis. Mayor Cenvantes met with and talked at length with African American leaders and included African-Americans in City government positions and city commissions.

During Cervantes&#x27; term a Commission on Crime and Law Enforcement was created, although Life Magazine accused Cervantes and the head of the Commission, lawyer Morris Shenker, of strong ties to organized crime. Voters passed a one per cent sales tax to put policemen on horseback in city parks. Car thefts were reduced by his &#x27;lock it and pocket the key&#x27; program. Mayor Cervantes was successful in getting a $2,000,000 bond issue passed for completion of the Gateway Arch and grounds. This was necessary to get $6,000,000 in Federal aid. A $15,000,000 bond issue for street lighting and a juvenile center was passed in 1972.

Other successes during his two terms included establishment of Night Housing Court, organization of a Business Development Commission to help keep businesses in the City and bring in new ones along with setting up the Area Office of Aging, Beautification Commission, and Citizens Service Bureau to handle complaints. The Land Reutilization Authority was created to take over vacant properties and group them for re-use.

Mayor Cervantes failed in his attempt to get a new airport started in Illinois, close to downtown St. Louis. He thought this would be a great benefit to the City and downtown St. Louis, but the proposal generated great controversy and helped lead to his defeat for a third term in 1973. Cervantes was defeated in that bid by John Poelker in the Democratic primary. Cervantes was defeated in another bid for mayor in 1977 by James F. Conway. Another Cervantes controversy was allowing the demolition of Pruitt Igoe, which left thousands of residents homeless.

== Later life ==
After serving as mayor, Cervantes taught at St. Louis University and returned as an active manager of his business interests that included Cervantes and Associates Insurance Agency and the Laclede Cab Company. After losing office, Cervantes published a memoir entitled &quot;Mr. Mayor&quot; (Los Angeles: Nash Publishing, 1974). Cervantes died in St. Louis on June 23, 1983, at age 62. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery.

What is currently the America&#x27;s Center convention center complex was originally named for Cervantes in 1977.

<doc id="1268880" wikidata="Q5580550" url="?curid=1268880" title="GolfCross">
<text>GolfCross is a variant of golf developed in New Zealand by Burton Silver. It is similar to golf, except that it uses an oval ball and holes are replaced by suspended goal nets. In addition, the green is replaced by a &quot;yard&quot;, and a player whose ball lies in the yard has the right to turn the goal net so as to face them.

According to Silver, the oval ball is designed so as to give the player more control over where the ball travels. Burton Silver explains:

Because the oval ball spins on two axes, it is almost impossible to hook or slice it. However, controlled hooks and slices are easily achieved by angling the ball on the specially designed tee adaptor. Back-spinning the ball and running it on is also achievable by the way in which the ball is set up on the tee.

According to NZ player Greg Turner, GolfCross is a more strategic and tactical game than regular golf, especially in match play, and because players are shooting for goal it tends to be more dramatic and exciting to play and watch.

GolfCross can bring back many advantages to normal golf. The mindset that the ball will hardly ever slice or hook can be bought back to golf and used effectively.

There are GolfCross courses in Germany, Argentina, England, Ireland, Scotland, and New Zealand. It is still unclear how widely GolfCross is played. Recent interest has centered on its ecological advantages. Because it doesn&#x27;t use putting greens, agricultural chemicals can be done away with, and because the ball is easy for any player to backspin, fairways don&#x27;t require irrigating to keep them soft in order to reduce run-on.

<doc id="1268882" wikidata="Q733180" url="?curid=1268882" title="Tom Mboya">
<text>Thomas Joseph Odhiambo Mboya (15August 19305July 1969) was a Kenyan trade unionist, educator, Pan-Africanist, author, independence activist, and statesman. He was one of the founding fathers of the Republic of Kenya. He led the negotiations for independence at the Lancaster House Conferences and was instrumental in the formation of Kenya&#x27;s independence party – the Kenya African National Union (KANU) – where he served as its first Secretary-General. He laid the foundation for Kenya&#x27;s capitalist and mixed economy policies at the height of the Cold War and set up several of the country&#x27;s key labour institutions. Mboya was Minister for Economic Planning and Development when he was assassinated. 

Mboya&#x27;s intelligence, charm, leadership, and oratory skills won him admiration from all over the world. He gave speeches, participated in debates and interviews across the world in favour of Kenya&#x27;s independence from British colonial rule. He also spoke at several rallies in the goodwill of the Civil Rights movement in the United States. In 1958, at the age of 28, Mboya was elected Conference Chairman at the All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference convened by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. He helped build the Trade Union Movement in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as well as across Africa. He also served as the Africa Representative to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In 1959, Mboya called a conference in Lagos, Nigeria, to form the first All-Africa ICFTU labour organization.

Mboya worked with both John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. to create educational opportunities for African students, an effort that resulted in the Kennedy Airlifts of the 1960s enabling East African students to study in American colleges. Notable beneficiaries of this airlift include Wangari Maathai. In 1960, Mboya was the first Kenyan to be featured on the front page cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in a painting by Bernard Safran.

==Early life==
His parents Leonardus Ndiege and Marcella Onyango were from the Luo ethnic group of Kenya, and were both low-income sisal cutters working on the colonial farm of Sir William Northrup McMillan, at today&#x27;s Juja Farm Area. Thomas (&quot;Tom&quot;) Joseph Odhiambo Mboya was born at this colonial sisal farm on 15 August 1930, near the town of Thika, in what was called the White Highlands of Kenya.
Mboya&#x27;s father Leonard Ndiege was later promoted as an overseer at this sisal plantation and worked for 25 years. Eventually Leonard and Marcella had seven children, five sons and two daughters. When Mboya was nine years old, his father sent him to a mission school in Kamba region.

==Education==
Mboya was educated at various Catholic mission schools. In 1942, he joined St. Mary&#x27;s School Yala – a Catholic secondary school in Yala, located in Nyanza province where Mboya began his education in English and History. In 1946, he attended the Holy Ghost College (later Mang&#x27;u High School), where he passed well enough to proceed to do his Cambridge School Certificate. In 1948, Mboya joined the Royal Sanitary Institute&#x27;s Medical Training School for Sanitary Inspectors at Nairobi, qualifying as an inspector in 1950. He also enrolled in a certificate course in economics at Efficiency Correspondence College of South Africa. In 1955, he received a scholarship from the Trades Union Congress to attend Ruskin College, where he studied industrial management. After his graduation in 1956, he returned to Kenya and joined politics at a time when the British colonial authorities were gradually suppressing the Mau Mau rebellion spearheaded by the Kenya Land and Freedom Army.

==Political life==
Mboya&#x27;s political life started immediately after he was employed at Nairobi City Council as a sanitary inspector in 1950. During his stint at Nairobi City Council, Mboya was elected as African Staff Association&#x27;s president and immediately embarked on moulding the association into a trade union named the Kenya Local Government Workers&#x27; Union. This made his employer suspicious, but he resigned from his position before he could be laid off. He was, however, able to continue working for the Kenya Labour Workers Union as secretary-general before embarking on his studies in Britain.

In 1953, during the Mau Mau War for Independence, Jomo Kenyatta and other leaders of the independence party, Kenya African Union (KAU), were arrested. They asked Mboya to lead the KAU and continue the struggle. However, the government banned the KAU. Mboya then turned to use the trade unions as a platform to fight for independence. He was elected as Secretary General of the Kenya Federation of Labour (KFL), the umbrella body for trade unions in Kenya. In that role, Mboya gave speeches in London and Washington, D.C. opposing British colonial rule in Kenya. He also organized several strikes seeking better working conditions for African workers. At that point, the colonial government nearly closed down the labour movement in the effort to suppress his activities. Mboya reached out to other labour leaders across the world, more so in the ICFTU, including American A. Philip Randolph, with whom he was close. Mboya raised funds to build a headquarters for the KFL.

In 1956, after Mboya had returned from the United Kingdom, the colonial government allowed black Africans to run for office and serve in the Legislative Assembly. Tom Mboya was elected from Nairobi. He was elected secretary of the African Caucus (called African Elected Members Organization – AEMO) and continued a campaign for independence, as well as seeking freedom for Jomo Kenyatta and other political prisoners. He used his incredible diplomacy skills to get support for the independence movement from foreign countries. In 1957, he became dissatisfied with the low number of African leaders (only eight out of fifty at the time) in the Legislative council and decided to form his party, the Nairobi People&#x27;s Convention Party.

At that time, Mboya developed a close relationship with Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana who, like Mboya, was a Pan-Africanist. In 1958, during the All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference in Ghana, convened by Kwame Nkrumah, Mboya was elected as the Conference Chairman at the age of 28. In 1959, Mboya along with the African-American Students Foundation in the United States organized the Airlift Africa project, through which 81 Kenyan students were flown to the U.S. to study at U.S. universities. Barack Obama&#x27;s father, Barack Obama Sr., was a friend of Mboya&#x27;s and a fellow Luo who received a scholarship through the AASF and occasional grants for books and expenses. Barack Obama Sr. was not on the first airlift plane in 1959, because he was headed for Hawaii, not the continental US. In 1960, the Kennedy Foundation agreed to underwrite the airlift, after Mboya visited Senator Jack Kennedy to ask for assistance, and Airlift Africa was extended to Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now Tanzania), Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Nyasaland (now Malawi). Some 230 African students received scholarships to study at Class I accredited colleges in the United States in 1960, and hundreds more in 1961–63.

In 1961, Jomo Kenyatta was released and, together with Oginga Odinga and Mboya&#x27;s Nairobi People&#x27;s Convention Party, joined with Kenya African Union and Kenya Independence Movement and formed the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in an attempt to form a party that would both transcend tribal politics and prepare for participation in the Lancaster House Conference (held at Lancaster House in London) where Kenya&#x27;s constitutional framework and independence were to be negotiated. As Secretary General of KANU, Mboya headed the Kenyan delegation and designed the flag for the new republic.

==After independence==
In the newly independent country, Mboya, who was a pre-independence Minister of Labour since 1962, was appointed by the New Prime Minister, Jomo Kenyatta, as the MP for Nairobi Central Constituency (today, Kamukunji Constituency) and became Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs—a post he held from 1 June 1963, until December 1964. He created the National Social Security Fund, Kenya&#x27;s social security scheme. He also established an Industrial Court to hear labour-management cases.

When Kenya became a republic on 12 December 1964, the new President Kenyatta appointed Tom Mboya to the Economic Planning and Development Ministry and transferred all functions of his former Justice ministry to the office of Attorney General under Charles Mugane Njonjo. Together with his deputy then Mwai Kibaki, he issued &quot;Sessional Paper 10,&quot; which defined Kenya&#x27;s form of economic policies, when it was debated and passed by parliament in 1965. Mboya presented the Sessional Paper No. 10 for debate in parliament in April 1965 covering the period of 1964 – 1970 under the title African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya. Kenyatta and Mboya were known advocates of a non-aligned international policy, not wanting blanket application of capitalism while completely abhorring scientific socialism. In 1966,Tom Mboya was removed from the economic planning ministry and Kibaki was appointed for the first time as full Minister for Commerce and Industry. Mboya&#x27;s development plans at the Economic Planning Ministry were credited for Kenya&#x27;s development rate of 7%, which was sustained during his tenure as the Planning Minister.

==Assassination==
He retained the portfolio as Minister for Economic Planning and Development until his death at the age of 39 when he was gunned down on 5 July 1969 at Government Road (now Moi Avenue), Nairobi CBD, after visiting Chaani&#x27;s Pharmacy. Nahashon Isaac Njenga Njoroge was convicted for the murder and later hanged. After his arrest, Njoroge asked: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you go after the big man?&quot; Due to such statements, suspicions arose that Mboya&#x27;s shooting was a political assassination.

Outrage over his assassination led to riots in the major cities of Kenya. President Jomo Kenyatta gave a eulogy at Mboya&#x27;s requiem mass, saying of his colleague: &quot;Kenya&#x27;s independence would have been seriously compromised were it not for the courage and steadfastness of Tom Mboya.&quot; A statue of Mboya was installed on Moi Avenue, where he was killed, and the nearby busy Victoria Street was renamed Tom Mboya Street in his honour.

Mboya left a wife and five children. He is buried in a mausoleum on Rusinga Island, which was built in 1970.

Mboya&#x27;s role in Kenya&#x27;s politics and transformation is the subject of increasing interest, especially with the prominence of American politician Barack Obama. Obama&#x27;s father, Barack Obama Sr., was a US-educated Kenyan who benefited from Mboya&#x27;s scholarship program in the 1960s, going on to get married during his stay there, fathering the future Illinois Senator and President. Obama Sr. had seen Mboya shortly before the assassination and testified at the ensuing trial. Obama Sr. believed he was later targeted in a hit-and-run incident as a result of this testimony.

In a 1976 interview, James Jesus Angleton, a retired senior CIA official, expressed his opinion that Mboya was killed by the KGB as part of a Cold War campaign against pro-Western politicians in Africa.

In 2023, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had known Mboya in his boyhood, publicly accused Daniel arap Moi of orchestrating Mboya&#x27;s assassination.

==Personal life==
Tom Mboya married Pamela Odede on Saturday, 20 January 1962 at St. Peter Claver’s Catholic Church on Racecourse Road, in Nairobi. Pamela, a graduate of the University of Makerere, was the daughter of politician Walter Odede. The couple had five children. Their daughters are Maureen Odero, a high court judge in Mombasa and Susan Mboya, a Coca-Cola executive, who continues the education airlift program initiated by Tom Mboya, and is married to former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero. Their sons included Lucas Mboya, and twin brothers Peter (died in a 2004 motorcycle accident) and Patrick (died aged four).

After Mboya&#x27;s death, Pamela had one child, Tom Mboya Jr, with Alphonse Okuku, the brother of Tom Mboya. Pamela died of an illness in January 2009 while seeking treatment in South Africa.

<text>The cluster of rocks that is Barrett Reef (often known as &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Reef&quot;) is one of the most hazardous reefs in New Zealand.

It lies on the western side of the entrance of Wellington Harbour, on the approaches to the city of Wellington, at coordinates . The reef is named after Richard (Dicky) Barrett (1807–1847), a whaler and trader. Its Māori name is &quot;Tangihanga-a-Kupe, (Mourning of Kupe)&quot;, which may refer to the reef&#x27;s similarity to a line of mourners at a tangi, the sad sound of the water around the reef, or Kupe crying for people he left behind in his travels. The reef is popular with recreational divers.

==Dangerous entrance==
The reef, much of which is exposed even at high tide, is located to the west of the two-kilometre-wide channel that links Cook Strait with Wellington Harbour, close to the shore of the Miramar Peninsula. The shipping channel lies between the reef and Pencarrow to the east. The area to the west between the reef and Point Dorset on the Miramar Peninsula is known as Chaffers Passage, after the captain of the &quot;Tory&quot;, a ship sent to New Zealand by the New Zealand Company in 1839. Due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman Sea, the currents are strong and fickle and gales are common. Add to this the volume of traffic which uses the shipping channel (including several crossings daily of the inter-island ferries to Picton), and it is not surprising that the reef has a lengthy roll-call of shipwrecks.

===History of vessels damaged, stranded, or wrecked on Barrett Reef===
* 1848 &quot;Subraon&quot;, barque, bound for Sydney on Barrett Reef. This vessel was carrying people away from Wellington on account of the Awatere valley, Marlborough earthquake (7.5) 16 Oct 1848; they were fleeing to Sydney.

<text>Sophia Louisa Jex-Blake (21 January 1840 – 7 January 1912) was an English physician, teacher, and feminist. She led the campaign to secure women access to a university education, when six other women and she, collectively known as the Edinburgh Seven, began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869. She was the first practising female doctor in Scotland, and one of the first in the wider United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; a leading campaigner for medical education for women, she was involved in founding two medical schools for women, in London and Edinburgh, at a time when no other medical schools were training women.

==Early life==

Sophia Jex-Blake was born at 3 Croft Place Hastings, England, on 21 January 1840, daughter of retired lawyer Thomas Jex-Blake, a proctor of Doctors&#x27; Commons, and Mary Jex-Blake (née Cubitt). Her brother was Thomas Jex-Blake, future Dean of Wells Cathedral, and father of Katharine Jex-Blake, classicist and Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge. Until the age of eight she was home-educated. She attended various private schools in southern England, and in 1858, enrolled at Queen&#x27;s College, London, despite her parents&#x27; objections. In 1859, while still a student, she was offered a post as mathematics tutor at the college where she stayed until 1861, living for some of that time with Octavia Hill&#x27;s family. She worked without pay; her family did not expect their daughter to earn a living, and her father refused her permission to accept a salary.

In 1865, once the Civil War was over, Sophia Jex-Blake travelled to the United States to learn more about women&#x27;s education. She visited various schools, was strongly influenced by developments in co-education in the US, and later published &quot;A Visit to Some American Schools and Colleges&quot;. At the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston, she met one of the country&#x27;s pioneer female physicians, Dr Lucy Ellen Sewall, who became an important and lifelong friend, and she worked there for a time as an assistant. This was a turning point for Jex-Blake, as she realised, during this visit, that to become a doctor was her life&#x27;s vocation.

In 1867, along with Susan Dimock, a trainee from the New England hospital, she wrote directly to the president and fellows of Harvard University, requesting admission to the university&#x27;s medical school. She and Dimock received their reply a month later, in a letter which stated: &quot;There is no provision for the education of women in any department of this university&quot;. The following year, she hoped to attend a new medical college being established by Elizabeth Blackwell in New York, but her father died, so she returned to England to be with her mother.

== &quot;A fair field and no favour&quot;==
In 1869, Jex-Blake&#x27;s essay &quot;Medicine as a profession for women&quot; appeared in a book edited by Josephine Butler: &quot;Women&#x27;s Work and Women&#x27;s Culture&quot;. In this, she argued that natural instinct leads women to concern themselves with the care of the sick. With education of girls being restricted to domestic crafts, though, women generally could not qualify to compete with men as medical practitioners. She argued that no objective proof existed of women&#x27;s intellectual inferiority to men. She said that the matter could easily be tested by granting women &quot;a fair field and no favour&quot; - teaching them as men were taught and subjecting them to the same examinations.

==Campaign==
Sophia Jex-Blake was determined to seek medical training in the UK, and due to Scotland&#x27;s more enlightened attitudes towards education, felt that if any university would allow women to study, it would be a Scottish one. She applied to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh in March 1869, and although the medical faculty and the &quot;senatus academus&quot; voted in favour of allowing her to study medicine, the university court rejected her application on the grounds that the university could not make the necessary arrangements &quot;in the interest of one lady&quot;.

She then advertised in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and other national newspapers for more women to join her. A second application was submitted in 1869 on behalf of the group of five women initially (with two more added later in the year to make the Edinburgh Seven - the group is Mary Anderson, Emily Bovell, Matilda Chaplin, Helen Evans, Sophia Jex-Blake, Edith Pechey, and Isabel Thorne). It requested the right to attend all the classes and examinations required for a degree in medicine. This second application was approved by the university court and the University of Edinburgh became the first British university to admit women.

Sophia Jex-Blake wrote in one of her letters to her great friend Lucy Sewall:

&quot;It is a grand thing to enter the very first British University ever opened to women, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;

== Surgeons&#x27; Hall riot==

As the women began to demonstrate that they could compete on equal terms with the male students, hostility towards them grew. They received obscene letters, were followed home, had fireworks attached to their front door, and had mud thrown at them. This culminated in the Surgeons&#x27; Hall riot on 18 November 1870, when the women arrived to sit an anatomy examination at Surgeons&#x27; Hall, and an angry mob of over 200 gathered outside throwing mud, rubbish, and insults at the women.

The events made national headlines and won the women many new supporters, but influential members of the medical faculty eventually persuaded the university to refuse graduation to the women by appealing decisions to higher courts. The courts eventually ruled that the women who had been awarded degrees should never have been allowed to enter the course. Their degrees were withdrawn and the campaign in Edinburgh failed in 1873. Many of the women went to European universities that were already allowing women to graduate, and completed their studies there.

===The time for a reform has come ===
Women were eventually admitted onto degree programmes at other British Universities in 1877. James Stansfeld, who had been closely associated with the London campaign (following the failure of the Edinburgh campaign) wrote, in his brief history of the events:
Dr Sophia Jex-Blake has made the greatest of all contributions to the end attained. I do not say that she has been the ultimate cause of success. The ultimate cause has been simply this, that the time was at hand. It is one of the lessons of the history of progress that when the time for reform has come you cannot resist it, though if you make the attempt, what you may do is to widen its character or precipitate its advent. Opponents, when the time has come, are not merely dragged at the chariot wheels of progress - they help to turn them. The strongest forces, whichever way it seems to work, does most to aid. The forces of greatest concentration here have been, in my view, on the one hand the Edinburgh University led by Sir Robert Christison, on the other the women claimants led by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake.

== Qualification as a physician==

In 1874, Sophia Jex-Blake helped establish the London School of Medicine for Women, which became the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine for Women, but also continued campaigning and studying. The Medical Act (39 and 40 Vict, Ch. 41) soon followed, which was an act to repeal the previous statute, while also permitting medical authorities to license all qualified applicants whatever their gender. The first organisation to take advantage of this new legislation was the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, but before Jex-Blake applied to them, she passed the medical exams at the University of Berne, where she was awarded a medical doctorate in January 1877. Four months later, she had further success in Dublin and qualified as licentiate of the King and Queen&#x27;s College of Physicians of Ireland, meaning she could at last be registered with the General Medical Council, the third registered woman doctor in the UK.

==Medical career==
Jex-Blake returned to Edinburgh, where she leased a house at 4 Manor Place, and in June 1878 put up her brass plate; Edinburgh had its first woman doctor. Three months later, she opened an outpatient clinic at 73 Grove Street, Fountainbridge, where poor women could receive medical attention for a few pence. After her mother&#x27;s death in 1881, Sophia Jex-Blake had a period of depressed reclusiveness. The dispensary expanded by 1885 was moved to larger premises at 6 Grove Street, where a five-bed ward was added. The little outpatient clinic thus became the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women. This was Scotland&#x27;s first hospital for women staffed entirely by women.

In 1886, she established the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women. Effectively a small extramural class, it was largely enabled by a small group of profemale male physicians linked to the University of Edinburgh giving extramural classes open to men and women (which the university could not prevent). The first students included Elsie Inglis, Grace Ross Cadell, and her sister Georgina, but Jex-Blake&#x27;s skill as a teacher did not match her role as a doctor. An acrimonious split emerged, with her students culminating in an infamous court case in 1889, where Jex-Blake was successfully sued for damages. Thereafter, the Cadell sisters pursued their studies with the more genial, though far younger, Elsie Inglis, who had set up a rival school, the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women. Jex-Blake&#x27;s school came to an effective end in 1892, when the University of Edinburgh began taking female students. The Elsie Inglis College continued until 1916, when it merged with the School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges of Edinburgh at Surgeons&#x27; Hall.

Jex-Blake lived and conducted her practice for 16 years in the house known as Bruntsfield Lodge on Whitehouse Loan. When she retired in 1889, the Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children moved to this site, and became known as Bruntsfield Hospital, where it continued to function until 1989.

==Personal life==
Jex-Blake is assumed to have been in a romantic relationship with Dr Margaret Todd. On Jex-Blake&#x27;s retirement in 1899, they moved to Windydene, Mark Cross, Rotherfield, where Dr Todd wrote &quot;The Way of Escape&quot; in 1902 and &quot;Growth&quot; in 1906. Her home became a meeting place for former students and colleagues, and she welcomed writers and acquaintances from the world over.

==Death and commemoration==
Jex-Blake died at Windydene on 7 January 1912, at age 71, and is buried at St Denys Rotherfield. Todd subsequently wrote &quot;The Life of Dr Sophia Jex-Blake&quot;.

The University of Edinburgh commemorated Jex-Blake with a plaque (by Pilkington Jackson) near the entrance to its medical school, honouring her as &quot;Physician, pioneer of medical education for women in Britain, alumna of the University&quot;.

In 2015, an Historic Scotland plaque was unveiled to commemorate the Surgeons&#x27; Hall Riot of 18 November 1870.

The Edinburgh Seven were awarded the posthumous honorary MBChB degrees at the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s McEwan Hall on 6 July 2019. The degrees were collected on their behalf by a group of current students at Edinburgh Medical School. Medical student Simran Piya collected an honorary degree on behalf of Sophia Jex-Blake. The graduation was the first of a series of events planned by the University of Edinburgh to commemorate the achievements and significance of the Edinburgh Seven.

In 2020, Bellfield Brewery launched a new India pale ale named after Sophia Jex-Blake.

In 2021, a production of a dramatic piece about the experiences of Jex-Blake and the Edinburgh Seven, &quot;Sophia&quot;, by Scottish playwright Frances Poet, was announced.

University College London established the Sophia Jex-Blake Chair of Physiology. The current incumbent is Professor Stephanie Schorge.

<doc id="1268897" wikidata="Q36748" url="?curid=1268897" title="Pontic Greek">
<text>Pontic Greek (, ; or &quot;Romeika&quot;) is a variety of Modern Greek indigenous to the Pontus region on the southern shores of the Black Sea, northeastern Anatolia, and the Eastern Turkish and Caucasus region. An endangered Greek language variety, Pontic Greek is spoken by about 778,000 people worldwide, who are known as Pontic or Pontian Greeks. 

Like nearly all of Greek varieties spoken today, the linguistic lineage of Pontic Greek stems from the Hellenistic Koine, itself based on Attic–Ionic Greek, which later developed into the Byzantine Greek of the Middle Ages. Following its geographic isolation from the rest of the Greek–speaking world, Pontic continued to develop separately along with other Anatolian Greek dialects, like Cappadocian, from the 11th century onwards. As a result, Pontic Greek is not completely mutually intelligible with the standard Demotic Greek spoken in mainland Greece today. Pontic also contains influences from Russian, Turkish, Kartvelian (namely Laz and Georgian) and Armenian.

Today, Pontians live predominantly in Northern Greece, following the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Out of their total population, around 200,000–300,000 are considered active Pontic speakers. Pontic Greek is also spoken in Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Kazakhstan, as well as by the Pontic diaspora. It remains spoken in pockets of the Pontus region, mostly by Pontic Greek Muslims in the eastern districts of Trabzon Province. Pontic is primarily written in the Greek script; the Latin script is sporadically used in Turkey, while the Cyrillic alphabet is rarely used in Russia and former Soviet countries.

== Classification ==
Pontic Greek is classified as an Indo-European, Greek language of the Attic-Ionic branch.

== Name ==
Historically, the speakers of Pontic Greek referred to their language as , also spelled in Latin as (); a historical and colloquial term also used for the Modern Greek language as a whole. Originating in Byzantine times, the term reflects the identification of the Greek–speaking Byzantine subjects as &quot;Rhomaioi&quot; () and the Medieval Greek language as &quot;Rhomaikḗ&quot; (). The term &quot;Pontic&quot; originated in scholarly usage, but it has been adopted as a mark of identity by Pontic Greeks living in Greece, where the language is commonly called (). Pontians also refer to their language as &quot;Pontiakón lalían&quot; () and at times as &quot;Laziká&quot;. The variety is also called &quot;Pontiakḗ diálektos&quot; () in standard modern Greek.

In Turkish, there is no special name for Pontic Greek; it is called (), derived from the Turkish word &quot;Rum&quot;, denoting Byzantine Greeks. Nowadays, Pontic speakers living in Turkey call their language , , or .
== History ==
Similar to most modern Greek dialects, Pontic Greek is mainly derived from Koine Greek, which was spoken in the Hellenistic and Roman times between the 4th century BC and the 4th century AD. Following the Seljuk invasion of Asia Minor during the 11th century AD, Pontus became isolated from many of the regions of the Byzantine Empire. The Pontians remained somewhat isolated from the mainland Greeks, causing Pontic Greek to develop separately and distinctly from the rest of the mainland Greek. However, the language has also been influenced by the nearby Persian, Caucasian, and Turkish languages.

== Dialects ==
Greek linguist Manolis Triantafyllidis has divided the Pontic of Turkey into two groups:
*the Western group (&quot;Oinountiac&quot; or ) around Oenoe (Turkish Ünye);
*the Eastern group, which is again subdivided into:
**the coastal subgroup (&quot;Trapezountiac&quot;) around Trebizond (Ancient Greek ) and
**the inland subgroup (&quot;Chaldiot&quot;) in Chaldia (around Argyroupolis (Gümüşhane) and Kanin in Pontic), its vicinity (Kelkit, Baibourt, etc.), and around Kotyora (Ordu).

Speakers of Chaldiot were the most numerous. In phonology, some varieties of Pontic are reported to demonstrate vowel harmony, a well-known feature of Turkish (Mirambel 1965).

Outside Turkey one can distinguish:
*the Northern group (Mariupol Greek or ), originally spoken in Crimea, but now principally in Mariupol, where the majority of Crimean Pontic Greeks of the Rumaiic subgroup now live. Other Pontic Greeks speak Crimean Tatar as their mother tongue, and are classified as &quot;Urums&quot;. There are approximately half a dozen dialects of Crimean (Mariupolitan) Pontic Greek spoken.
*Soviet Rumaiic, a Soviet variant of the Pontic Greek language spoken by the Pontic Greek population of the Soviet Union.

=== Ophitic ===
The inhabitants of the Of valley who had converted to Islam in the 17th century remained in Turkey and have partly retained the Pontic language until today. Their dialect, which forms part of the Trapezountiac subgroup, is called &quot;Ophitic&quot; by linguists, but speakers generally call it . As few as 5,000 people are reported to speak it. There are however estimates that show the real number of the speakers as considerably higher. Speakers of Ophitic/Romeyka are concentrated in the eastern districts of Trabzon province: Çaykara (Katohor), Dernekpazarı (Kondu), Sürmene (Sourmena) and Köprübaşı (Göneşera). Although less widespread, it is still spoken in some remote villages of the Of district itself. It is also spoken in the western İkizdere (Dipotamos) district of Rize province. Historically the dialect was spoken in a wider area, stretching further east to the port town of Pazar (Athina).

Ophitic has retained the infinitive, which is present in Ancient Greek but has been lost in other variants of Modern Greek (except Italiot Greek); it has therefore been characterized as &quot;archaic&quot; or conservative (even in relation to other Pontic dialects) and as the living language that is closest to Ancient Greek. Because a majority of the population of these districts converted to Islam during the 17th to 19th centuries, some Arabic and Turkish loanwords have been adopted in the language. According to Vahit Tursun, writer of the Romeika-Turkish dictionary, loanwords from the neighboring Laz speakers of Rize province are strikingly absent in the Romeika vocabulary of Trabzon natives.

A very similar dialect is spoken by descendants of Christians from the Of valley (especially from Kondu) now living in Greece in the village of Nea Trapezounta, Pieria, Central Macedonia, with about 400 speakers.

== Geographic distribution ==
Though Pontic was originally spoken on the southern shores of the Black Sea, from the 18th and 19th century and on substantial numbers migrated into the northern and eastern shores, into the Russian Empire. Pontic is still spoken by large numbers of people in Ukraine, mainly in Mariupol, but also in other parts of Ukraine such as the Odesa and Donetsk region, in Russia (around Stavropol) and Georgia. The language enjoyed some use as a literary medium in the 1930s, including a school grammar (Topkharas 1998 [1932]).

Though many were displaced as a result of Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as of 2024 the majority of Mariupol&#x27;s Greeks have opted to remain in the city and its adjacent villages.

After the massacres of the 1910s, the majority of speakers remaining in Asia Minor were subject to the Treaty of Lausanne population exchange, and were resettled in Greece (mainly northern Greece). A second wave of migration occurred in the early 1990s, this time from countries of the former Soviet Union.

In urban areas in Greece the language is no longer spoken in daily life but in villages and towns with more homogeneous Pontic population, located mostly in the northern part of country, the language is still in active daily usage. Many radio stations broadcast in the Pontic language, and many associations exist for its safeguard.

== Official status ==
=== Greece ===
In Greece, Pontic has no official status, like all other Greek dialects.

=== Soviet Union ===
Historically, Pontic Greek was the &quot;de facto&quot; language of the Greek minority in the USSR, although in the (, All-Union Conference) of 1926, organised by the Greek–Soviet intelligentsia, it was decided that Demotic should be the official language of the community.

Later revival of Greek identity in the Soviet Union and post-Communist Russia saw a renewed division on the issue of Rumaiic versus Demotic. A new attempt to preserve a sense of ethnic Rumaiic identity started in the mid-1980s. The Ukrainian scholar Andriy Biletsky created a new Slavonic alphabet, but though a number of writers and poets make use of this alphabet, the population of the region rarely uses it.

== Culture ==
The language has a rich oral tradition and folklore and Pontic songs are particularly popular in Greece. There is also some limited production of modern literature in Pontic, including poetry collections (among the most renowned writers is Kostas Diamantidis), novels, and translated Asterix comic albums. The youth often speak standard Greek as their first language. The use of Pontic has been maintained more by speakers in North America than it has in Greece.

== Alphabets ==
Pontic, in Greece, is written in the Greek alphabet, with diacritics: for , for (phonological ). Pontic, in Turkey, is written in the Latin alphabet following Turkish conventions. In Russia, it is written in the Cyrillic alphabet. In early Soviet times, Pontic was written in the Greek alphabet phonetically, as shown below, using digraphs instead of diacritics; were written out as , . The Pontic Wikipedia uses Greek script: it has adopted εα, εο for these vowels, to avoid clashes with Modern Greek ια, ιο, and uses digraphs from the Soviet system instead of diacritics, but otherwise follows historical orthography.

== Archaisms ==

The following are features of Pontic Greek which have been retained from early forms of Greek, in contrast to the developments of Modern Greek.

=== Phonology ===
* The vowel &quot;η&quot; sometimes merged with &quot;ε&quot; rather than &quot;ι&quot; (κέπιν = κήπιον, κλέφτες = κλέπτης, συνέλικος = συνήλικος, νύφε = νύ(μ)φη, έγκα = ἤνεγκον, έτον = ἦτον, έκουσα = ἤκουσα etc.).
* The vowel &quot;ω&quot; merged with &quot;o&quot; even in those cases where Koine Greek received it as &quot;ου&quot; (ζωμίν = ζουμί, καρβώνι, ρωθώνι etc.).
* Preservation of the Ionic consonant pair &quot; instead of Koine &quot; .

=== Declension of nouns and adjectives ===
* Preservation of the ancient nominative suffix &quot;&quot; in neuter diminutive nouns from Ancient Greek &quot;-&quot; (; Pontic ).
* Preservation of the termination of feminine compound adjectives in 
* The declension of masculine nouns from singular, nominative termination &quot;&quot; to genitive 
* The ancient accenting of nouns in vocative form: 

=== Conjugation of verbs ===
* The second aorist form in 
* The middle voice verb termination in .
* The passive voice aorist termination in (anc. ): etc.
* The imperative form of passive aorist in (anc 
* The sporadic use of infinitives 
* Pontic (&quot;is&quot;) from Koine idiomatic form &#x27; (standard Ancient Greek &#x27;), compare the Biblical form (&quot;there is&quot;), Modern Greek &quot;ine&quot; ()

===Lexicology===
* The sporadic use of in the place of : 
* Pontic (; &quot;ours&quot;) from Ancient Greek in contrast to Modern Greek 

=== Comparison with Ancient Greek ===
; 1. Attachment of the /e/ sound to the ancient infinitive suffix (in Trapezountiac Pontic)

; 2. Preservation of the Ancient infinitive suffix 

; 3. Ancient first aorist infinitive suffix -αι has been replaced by second aorist suffix -ειν

; 4. Attachment of the /e/ sound to the ancient aorist infinitive suffix 

; 5. Same aorist suffix was also the regular perfect suffix)

; 6. Ancient Greek infinitive &gt; Pontic Greek infinitive

&quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; appeared as a serial in the manga magazine &quot;Newtype&quot; from 1993 to 1995, based on the 1865 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll. Kadokawa Shoten collected the seven chapters into one bound volume and published it in September 1995. While the concept of &quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; was initially imagined as the first chapter by writer Ohkawa, the team continued with it for the enjoyment it provided. An image album and an original video animation adaptation of the first two chapters were published in 1995.

In 2002, Tokyopop announced that it had licensed &quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; for an English-language translation, and published it in October 2003. It is now out of print. It received a range of critical reaction from reviewers, from praise as cute entertainment to criticism as the worst of Clamp&#x27;s works. The eponymous protagonist has made cameo appearances in other works by Clamp: the music video &quot;Clamp in Wonderland&quot; (1994) Clamp School Detectives (1997), and the fantasy manga series &quot;&quot; (2003–2009). Viz Media acquired the rights to the manga and digitally published it on September 24, 2014.

==Plot==
&quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; consists of seven independent chapters linked together by the eponymous protagonist.

*: While rushing to high school, Miyuki sees a skateboarding playboy bunny, and falls down a rabbit hole. There she meets various women who find her attractive, and panicking, awakens from her dream. However, as she runs to school, the woman skateboards past her again.
*: While combing her hair in front of a mirror, Miyuki finds herself kissed by her reflection and pulled into the mirror, where she meets women who find her attractive. Fleeing from them, she eventually returns to her bedroom.
*: Miyuki awakens to find that she has overslept and missed the television broadcast of the film &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968). She is then pulled into the television by a pair of legs. Fleeing from the women who consider her attractive, Miyuki wakes up to see a pair of legs emerging from the television. 
*: Rushing to her part-time work at a diner, Miyuki finds a boxing ring, in which she is pitted against other restaurants&#x27; employees. She attempts to escape, only to be caught and blasted. She awakens, having bumped her head on the staff room door, and enters to find the boxing ring.
*: Miyuki reads a comic about mah-jongg, when three mah-jongg players appear to play strip mah-jongg with her. One reveals herself to be &quot;Mah-Jongg Girl&quot;, a superheroine, and with her defeat, Miyuki takes her place. She eventually awakens.
*: After failing to complete a video game, Miyuki accepts the video game&#x27;s offer to take over as the heroine and is transported inside the game, where she meets women who find her attractive. Miyuki, however, dies inside the game, and the same game menu appears. 
*: While watching &quot;X&quot; in the film theater, Miyuki is swooped into the film, where its characters find her attractive. She awakens in the theater to find that she has now replaced its protagonist, to her shock.

==Development==
&quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; was developed by Clamp—the all-female manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. Ohkawa conceived the concept of &quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot;, which was supposed to serve as the first chapter. The team, however, decided to continue with the concept, as Ohkawa was fond of it and Mokona enjoyed illustrating the characters. The protagonist was illustrated with her school uniform, as that provided the team with more fan service opportunities during action scenes. In retrospective, the team felt that the manga acted as a showcase for Mokona&#x27;s &quot;sexy, female character designs&quot;, writing: &quot;It was fun, but a little hentai.&quot;

==Media==

Written and illustrated by Clamp, the seven chapters of &quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; appeared as a serial in the manga magazine &quot;Newtype&quot; from 1993 to 1995. Kadokawa Shoten published the chapters in one bound volume on September 10, 1995, and re-released it on May 1, 2001.

Tokyopop licensed &quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; for an English-language release in North America, and published it on October 5, 2003. It has since gone out of print. The manga has also been translated into other languages, such as Italian by Planet Manga, and German by Carlsen Verlag.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Miyuki-chan in Wonderland&quot; received a range of critical reaction. In &quot;Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot; (2009), Eden Lee Lackner wrote that the manga&#x27;s notability stems from &quot;how it plays with textual boundaries&quot;; for example, Miyuki travels through Clamp&#x27;s adaptation of the fictional worlds of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;X&quot;. According to her, Miyuki&#x27;s travels to X land serves as &quot;characteristic&quot; of Clamp&#x27;s intersection of its characters and narratives from its different works. Writing for &quot;Sequential Tart&quot;, Sheena McNeil greatly enjoyed the manga, praising it as entertaining &quot;fluff&quot;. Patrick King of &quot;Animefringe&quot; wrote that the illustrations contributed the most appeal to the plotless manga, with the inclusion of a bonus section and colored OVA concept-art pages praised as well. In contrast, Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for &quot;PopCultureShock&quot;, described the manga as &quot;the nadir of this talented quartet’s work&quot; in her list of the ten worst manga. According to her, the &quot;inane&quot; short stories served as &quot;just a pretext for CLAMP to draw scantily-clad beauties engaging in vaguely naughty behavior (usually making a pass at the vaguely horrified Miyuki or inviting her to play strip poker).&quot; Mason Templar, writing in &quot;&quot; (2007), similarly reviewed the manga, commenting that it was best viewed as an artbook. Erica Friedman, the founder of Yuricon, a lesbian-themed convention, and ALC Publishing, wrote that the settings were &quot;loosely based on Lewis Carroll’s iconic works, games and Clamp’s own work.&quot; According to her, the manga lacked emotion and a true depiction of lesbians, only showing &quot;fictitious female beings groping a fictitious female character&quot;.

The anime adaptation also received a range of reviews. Anime News Network&#x27;s Christopher Macdonald recommended it as nonsensical entertainment, describing it as Clamp&#x27;s tribute to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and its sequel &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; (1871). McNeil praised it as nicely animated entertainment, though it lacked developed characters and a plot. In his review of the anime adaptation, King concluded: &quot;It&#x27;s simply a showcase of some cute and sexy animation designed by CLAMP, no more, no less.&quot; He noted the absence of an English-language dub. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment praised the character designs and voice acting, rating the anime C-. Another reviewer for &quot;Sequential Tart&quot; expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the anime, and wrote that it might appeal to fans of Clamp or art films. While praising the visuals and audio as helping to create a surreal atmosphere, Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews, in contrast, wrote that the effect was ruined by the sexual nature of the plot; he recommended &quot;Dreams&quot; (1990) or &quot;Robot Carnival&quot; (1987) instead. In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation since 1917&quot; (2001), Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy unfavorably reviewed the anime, describing it as &quot;pointlessly kinky.&quot;

Miyuki has appeared in other works by Clamp. She appears in the video collection &quot;Clamp in Wonderland&quot; (1994), and makes a cameo appearance in the backgrounds of the fantasy manga series &quot;&quot; (2003–2009).

<text>Theydon Bois ( ) is a London Underground station in the village of Theydon Bois in Essex, England. It is on the Central line between Debden and Epping stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 6.

==History==
The station was opened as &quot;Theydon&quot; by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on 24 April 1865 but in December that year it was renamed to its present name. It opened as an intermediate station on their Loughton–Ongar extension; the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. &#x27;Milk trains&#x27; to Liverpool Street were a regular feature in the timetable until the underpass from Leyton to Stratford was built.

As part of the New Works Programme, 1935–1940, the LNER branch was transferred to London Underground, to form the part of the eastern extension of the Central line.

In 2015, advocacy by a local group forced a proposed 80-space commuter car park to seek planning permission before being constructed on land adjacent to the station.

==The station today==
The station was one of the first on the Underground network to operate without a staffed ticket office.

<doc id="1268918" wikidata="Q853414" url="?curid=1268918" title="Cappadocian Greek">
<text>Cappadocian Greek (, also known as Cappadocian is a dialect of modern Greek, originally spoken in Cappadocia (modern-day Central Turkey) by the descendants of the Byzantine Greeks of Anatolia. The language originally diverged from Medieval Greek after the late medieval migrations of the Turks from Central Asia into what is now Turkey began cutting the Cappadocians off from the rest of the Greek-speaking Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. As a result of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, all remaining speakers (known in Turkey as Rûm, and referred to now as Cappadocian Greeks) were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily in Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians were encouraged to shift to Standard Modern Greek as part of their integration into Greece, and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, Mark Janse (Ghent University) and Dimitris Papazachariou (University of Patras) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to their parents and grandparents. The latter are much less inclined to speak Cappadocian and more often than not switch to Standard Modern Greek.

==History and research==
By the fifth century AD, the last of the Indo-European native languages of Asia Minor ceased to be spoken, replaced by Koine Greek. At the same time, the communities of central Anatolia were becoming actively involved in the affairs of the then Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, and some (now Greek-speaking) Cappadocians, such as Maurice Tiberius (r. 582–602) and Heraclius (r. 610 to 641), would even rise to become emperors.

Cappadocian Greek first began to diverge from the Medieval Greek common language of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire six centuries later, following the Byzantines&#x27; defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This subsequent civil war and the Seljuk invasion led to the severing of Cappadocia from the rest of the Byzantine world. Among all Greek dialects, Cappadocian Greek is the one most influenced by Turkish, but unlike Standard Modern Greek, it would not be influenced by Venetian or French, which entered Modern Greek during the Frankokratia period, when those groups began ruling in Greece following the Fourth Crusade&#x27;s sacking of Byzantine Constantinople.

The earliest records of the language are in the macaronic poems of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi (1207–1273), who lived in Iconium (Konya), and some ghazals by his son Sultan Walad. Interpretation of the Greek language texts is difficult as they are written in Arabic script, and in Rumi&#x27;s case without vowel points; Dedes&#x27; edition (Δέδες) is the most recent edition.

By the early 20th century many Cappadocians had shifted to Turkish altogether (written with the Greek alphabet, Karamanlidika). Where Greek was maintained (numerous villages near Kayseri, including Misthi, Malakopea, Prokopion, Karvali, and Anakou), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish. However, there are next to no written documents in Medieval or early Modern Cappadocian, as the language was, and still essentially is, a spoken language only. Those educated to read and write, such as priests, would do so in the more classicising literary Greek. The earliest outside studies of spoken Cappadocian date from the 19th century, but are generally not very accurate.

One of the first documented studies was &quot;Modern Greek in Asia Minor: A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa&quot; (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1916), by Richard MacGillivray Dawkins (1871–1955), then a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and later the first Bywater and Sotheby Professor of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature at the University of Oxford, based on fieldwork conducted by the author in Cappadocia in 1909–1911.

After the population exchange, several Cappadocian dialects have been described by collaborators of the Center for Asia Minor Studies (Κέντρον Μικρασιατικών Σπουδών) in Athens: Uluağaç (I.I. Kesisoglou, 1951), Aravan (D. Phosteris &amp; I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960), Axo (G. Mavrochalyvidis &amp; I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960) and Anaku (A.P. Costakis, 1964), resulting in a series of grammars.

In recent years, the study of Cappadocian has seen a revival following the pioneering work on &quot;Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics&quot; (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988) by Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman, and a series of publications on various aspects of Cappadocian linguistics by Mark Janse, professor at Roosevelt Academy, who has also contributed a grammatical survey of Cappadocian to a forthcoming handbook on Modern Greek dialects edited by Christos Tzitzilis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki).

The recent discovery of Cappadocian speakers by Janse and Papazachariou will result in the release of a new dictionary and a compilation of texts.

Cappadocian Greek is well known from the linguistic literature as being one of the first well documented cases of language death, and in particular the significant admixture of non-Indo-European linguistic features into an Indo-European language. This process was pronounced in southwestern Cappadocia, and included the introduction of vowel harmony and verb-final word order.

==Characteristics==
The Greek element in Cappadocian is to a large extent Byzantine, e.g. or &#x27;door&#x27; from (Ancient and) Byzantine Greek (Modern Greek ), or &#x27;I did&#x27; from Byzantine Greek (Modern Greek ). Other, pre-Byzantine, archaisms are the use of the possessive adjectives , etc. from Ancient Greek , etc. and the formation of the imperfect by means of the suffix from the Ancient Greek (Ionic) iterative suffix . Turkish influence appears at every level. The Cappadocian sound system includes the Turkish vowels , , , and the Turkish consonants , , , , , , , although some of these are also found in modern Greek words as a result of palatalization.

Turkish vowel harmony is found in forms such as &#x27;I think&#x27;, aor. 3sg &lt; (Malakopi), from Turkish , &lt; &#x27;king&#x27; (Delmeso), from Turkish . Cappadocian noun morphology is characterized by the emergence of a generalized agglutinative declension and the progressive loss of grammatical gender distinctions, e.g. &#x27;the (neuter) woman (feminine)&#x27;, genitive , plural , genitive (Uluağaç). Another Turkish feature is the morphological marking of definiteness in the accusative case, e.g. &#x27;wolf (nominative / unmarked indefinite accusative)&#x27; vs. &#x27;wolf (marked definite accusative)&#x27;.

Agglutinative forms are also found in the verb system such as the pluperfect &#x27;I had come&#x27; (lit. &#x27;I came I was&#x27;) (Delmeso) on the model of Turkish (). Although Cappadocian word order is essentially governed by discourse considerations such as topic and focus, there is a tendency towards the Turkish subject–object–verb word order with its typological correlates (suffixation and pre-nominal grammatical modifiers).

The commonality among all Greek Cappadocian dialects is that they evolved from Byzantine Greek under the influence of Turkish. On the other hand, those dialects evolved in isolated villages. This has resulted in a variety of Greek Cappadocian dialects.

== Revitalisation ==
Although Cappadocian Greek was once believed to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary &quot;Last Words&quot;, which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop went so far as to say that Janse&#x27;s speech &quot;has lifted their shame.&quot; The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population.

<text>Embley Park, in Wellow (near Romsey, Hampshire), was the family home of Florence Nightingale from 1825 until her death in 1910. It is also where Florence Nightingale claimed she had received her divine calling from God. It is now the location of Embley, a co-educational independent school for 3–18 year olds. Embley was known as Hampshire Collegiate School until September 2019.

== The Home ==
In 1826, Florence Nightingale&#x27;s father William Nightingale purchased Embley Park house for the family to use as a permanent residence with Lea Hurst being used as a summer residence. The house was the larger of the two and was described as:

a good-sized plain square house of the late Georgian period, the situation warm and sheltered, the gardens very large and exceptionally fine. The shooting was good, London was reasonably near, and Fanny&#x27;s two married sisters, Mrs Nicholson at Waverley Abbey near Farnham and Mrs Bonham-Carter at Fair Oak, near Winchester, were within easy reach.

Nightingale claimed she had received her first divine calling from God in 1837 at Embley whilst she sat underneath a tree in the grounds. She then stayed there after her return from the Crimean War for some time before returning for visits whilst living in London. After her death in London in 1910, her body was brought by train back to Romsey and her coffin carried from the station to the church at East Wellow where she is buried.

==The school==

A school was first established at Embley Park in 1946. Mergers with various other schools followed, resulting in the creation of Hampshire Collegiate School in 2006. The school changed its name to Embley in September 2019. The school is part of the United Church Schools Trust.

<text>A [[Runic]] calendar (also Rune staff or Runic almanac) is a perpetual calendar, variants of which were used in Northern Europe until the 19th century. A typical runic calendar consisted of several horizontal lines of symbols, one above the other. Special days like solstices, equinoxes, and celebrations (including Christian holidays and feasts) were marked with additional lines of symbols. 

Runic calendars were written on parchment or carved onto of wood, bone, or horn. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is a staff from Nyköping, Sweden, believed to date from the 13th century. Most of the several thousand which survive are wooden calendars dating from the 16th and the 17th centuries. During the 18th century, Runic calendars had a renaissance as antiques, and runic calendars dating from around 1800 were made in the form of brass tobacco boxes.

==Marks==
On one line, 52 weeks of 7 days were laid out using 52 repetitions of the first seven runes of the Younger Futhark. The runes corresponding to each weekday varied from year to year.

On another line, many of the days were marked with one of 19 symbols representing the 19 Golden numbers, for the years of the Metonic cycle. In early calendars, each of the 19 years in the cycle was represented by a rune; the first 16 were the 16 runes of the Younger Futhark, plus three special runes improvised for the remaining three years. The new moon would fall on that day during that year of the cycle. For example, in the 18th year of the cycle, the new moons would fall on all the dates marked with &quot;tvimadur&quot;, the symbol for year 18. Later calendars used Pentadic numerals for the values 1–19.

Because this system needed 19 runes to represent the 19 golden numbers which stood for the 19 years of the perpetual calendar&#x27;s cycle, the Younger Futhark was insufficient, having only 16 characters. The solution devised was to add three special runes to represent the remaining numbers: (&quot;arlaug&quot;; Golden Number 17), (&quot;tvimadur&quot; or &quot;tvímaður&quot;; Golden Number 18), and (&quot;belgthor&quot;; Golden Number 19). In 1636, Ole Worm documented the Younger Futhark numeral system, including these three characters, in his &quot;Runir seu Danica literatura antiquissima&quot; (&quot;Runes: the oldest Danish literature&quot;).

A version using the Latin alphabet for weekdays and Arabic numerals for the golden numbers was printed in 1498 as part of the &quot;Breviarium Scarense&quot;.

==Primstav==
A primstav is the ancient Norwegian calendar stick. These were engraved with images instead of runes. The images depicted the different nonmoving religious holidays. The oldest primstav still in existence is from 1457 and is kept at the National Museum of Denmark.

== Modern use ==
Adherents of the Estonian ethnic religion (&quot;Maausk&quot;) have published Runic calendars () every year since 1978. Until 1991, the calendar was an illegal &quot;samizdat&quot; publication under the Soviet government.

<doc id="1268934" wikidata="Q3547653" url="?curid=1268934" title="Lakandula">
<text>Lakandula (Baybayin: , Spanish orthography: &quot;Lacandola&quot;) was the title of the last &quot;lakan&quot; or paramount ruler of pre-colonial Tondo when the Spaniards first conquered the lands of the Pasig River delta in the Philippines in the 1570s.

The firsthand account of Spanish Royal Notary Hernando Riquel says that he introduced himself to the Spanish as &quot;Sibunao Lacandola&quot;. While his given name has since been interpreted as being &quot;Bunao&quot;, the historic meaning of the word Lakan, was a title equivalent to prince or paramount ruler, meaning he was the principal Datu or Prince of his domain.

Along with Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman, Bunao Lakandula (or Lakan of Tondo), was one of three rulers who played significant roles in the Spanish conquest of the Pasig River delta polities during the earliest days of the Philippines under Spanish colonial period.

While it is questionable whether &quot;Lakandula&quot; represented a single titular name during his own lifetime, a few of his descendants in the first few generations after his death came to refer to themselves as the &quot;Lakandula of Tondo&quot;, taking that name on as a noble title.

==Name and title==
Over time, the Lakandula&#x27;s name has come to be written in several ways. However, according to the firsthand account written in Spanish by Hernando Riquel, the royal notary who accompanied Miguel López de Legazpi, the Lord of Tondo specifically identified himself as &quot;Sibunao Lacandola, lord of the town of Tondo&quot; when he boarded Legazpi&#x27;s ship with the lords of Manila on May 18, 1571. According to Riquel, the lords of Manila introduced themselves as &quot;Rajah Ache the Old and Rajah Soliman the Young, lords and principals of the town of Manila&quot;

In page 13 of &quot;Cracks in the Parchment Curtain&quot;, preeminent historian William Henry Scott quotes Riquel&#x27;s original text, which he found in the Spanish archives under &quot;Archivo General de Indias Seccion Patronato leg. 24, no 24.&quot; The relevant part of the text read: &quot;...declaracion llamarse Raha Ache el Viejo y Raha Solimane el Mozo, senores y principales del pueblo de Manila, y&quot; Sibunao Lacandola, principal del pueblo de Tondo...(emphasis added)

Modern historians routinely remove the Filipino word &quot;si&quot;, a grammatical article that precede personal names, from recorded names during this era because Spanish writers had not yet learned the local languages and often mistakenly included &quot;si-&quot; in Filipino names. &quot;Sibunao&quot; thus should be interpreted as &quot;[Ako] si Bunao&quot; = &quot;[I am] Bunao&quot;. Historians thus take this to mean that the Lakan introduced himself as &quot;Bunao Lakandula.&quot; At the time, Lakandula was assumed to be a regnal name, but as noted below, it was actually his title.

===Etymology of &quot;Lakandula&quot;===
His title &quot;Lakan&quot; denoted a &quot;paramount ruler&quot; (or more specifically, &quot;paramount datu&quot;) of one of the large coastal settlements (known as a &quot;bayan&quot; or &quot;large barangay&quot;) of the Tagalog people.

In its current Tagalog form, means &quot;gentleman&quot;.

Another common variation of the name is Gat Dula (&quot;alternatively spelled as a single word, Gatdula&quot;). Historically, the prefix &quot;Gat&quot;, a shortened version of the Tagalog honorific &quot;Pamagat&quot;, meant &quot;nobleman.&quot; Hence, Gatdula would literally read &quot;Nobleman of the Palace&quot;, meaning essentially the same thing as the Kapampangan version, Lakandula.

This leaves the matter of the addendum &quot;dula&quot; to be settled. While this could not have been a family name such as Filipinos use today, this may not be a satisfactory explanation, since static family names were introduced to the Filipino culture much later, by a decree issued by Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa on November 11, 1849. Alternatively, rather than a surname per se, Dula may have referred to a family group or clan, but there does not neem to be any historical evidence to support this postulation. Historian Jose N. Sevilla y Tolentino, theorized that &quot;Dula&quot; was not a personal name at all, but a local word that meant something akin to &quot;Palace&quot;. While he may not have ruled from a literal palace, this would have indicated the Lakan&#x27;s seat of power. As such, the &quot;Lakandula&quot; would have been the local language title for the &quot;Lord of the Palace&quot; and ruler of Tondo. Analogously, contemporary Rajah Ache was referred to as Rajah Matanda (Old Rajah), while Rajah Sulayman was sometimes referred to as Rajah Muda or Rajamora (Young Rajah).

Historians such as Dery and Scott explain that his given name was Bunaw, but they also continue to refer to him by his title, Lakandula or &quot;the&quot; Lakandula. On the other hand, Joaquin explains that the Lakan&#x27;s given name was Bunaw, and proceeds to call him Lakan Dula (separate words) or &quot;the&quot; Lakan Dula throughout his &quot;Manila, My Manila&quot; manuscript. In any case, many contemporary historians continue to ignore the fact that Lakan was a title, and refer to the last Lakan of Dula (or Lakan of Tondo) as &quot;Lakandula&quot; as if it had been his name. All things considered, the most accurate way to style the historical person&#x27;s name and title would be &quot;Bunao, Lakandula&quot; or &quot;the Lakan of Tondo&quot;.

===&quot;Lakan&quot; instead of &quot;Rajah&quot;===
While he has been erroneously referred to as Rajah Lakandula, the terms &quot;Rajah&quot; and &quot;Lakan&quot; actually have practically the same meaning. In Tondo, the native Lakan title was used, making the use of both &quot;Rajah&quot; and &quot;Lakandula&quot; at the same time both redundant and erroneous.
 and Filipino historian and national artist for literature Nick Joaquin takes pains to point out that the term &quot;Lakan&quot;, not &quot;Rajah&quot;, was used by the rulers of Tondo.

==Life before the arrival of the Spaniards==
Little is known about the early life of Bunaw, Lakan Dula, before the arrival of Legazpi. According to National Artist Nick Joaquin &quot;&quot;he is presumed to be of native birth&quot;,&quot; with mixed Sinaunang Tagalog (Dumagat) and Kapampangan ancestry. Joaquin adds that &quot;He was said to be a descendant of King Balagtas.&quot;

Joaquin further speculates on the Lakandula&#x27;s religious beliefs: &quot;Tondo&#x27;s Lakan Dula may have been unusual in being neither foreign nor Muslim. This was indicated by his use of the native term Lakan instead of the foreign [Muslim] title Rajah. Lakandula can be presumed . . . to have been reared in the anito cults. One guess is that he converted to Islam, then changed his mind and returned to his native faith.&quot;

Joaquin also expounds on the economic context of the Lakandula&#x27;s reign over Tondo: &quot;Tondo had replaced Namayan as the chief port of entry on Manila Bay. Tondo was right on the seaside. This was the advantage it had over Namayan, which was upriver inland. So the merchant ships that came into the bay preferred to unload their goods at the port of Tondo. And now it was the king of Tondo who was responsible for sending the merchandise upriver to the lakeside communities, there to be traded for local products. Tondo was thus the distributing center, or entrepot, on the delta... At the time of [the last] Lakan [in the 1570s], Tondo was at the height of its career as an entrepot….&quot;

According to Scott (1982), when ships from China arrived at Manila Bay, the Lakandula would remove the sails and rudders of their ships until they paid him duties and anchorage fees, and then he would then buy up all their goods himself, paying half its value immediately and then paying the other half upon their return the following year. In the interim, he would trade these goods with peoples further upstream, the end result being that other locals were not able to buy anything from the Chinese directly, but only through the Lakandula, who made a considerable profit as a result.

William Henry Scott notes that Augustinian Fray Martin de Rada Legaspi reported that the Tagalogs were &quot;more traders than warriors&quot;, and elsewhere notes that Maynila&#x27;s ships got their goods from Tondo and then dominated trade through the rest of the archipelago. People in other parts of the archipelago often referred to Maynila&#x27;s boats as &quot;Chinese&quot; (Sina or Sinina) because they came bearing Chinese goods.

==Arrival of Legazpi, May 1571==
When Miguel Lopez de Legazpi arrived at Manila Bay in May 1571, the Lakandula was there to meet him. The two first met on May 17, the day after Legazpi&#x27;s arrival on the bay, when Rajah Matanda and Lakandula boarded Legazpi&#x27;s ship to discuss terms with him. Part of these discussions specified that the Spaniards would not land in Tondo, and would instead land in Manila, which had been burned to the ground the year before. Joaquin suggests that Lakandula would &quot;have seen that Legaspi was being practical. Burned down and emptied, Maynila would be a better spot to fortify, being more strategic.&quot; In fact, Manila was not conquered, but it was occupied through a peace pact that joined Legazpi and the three kings: the Lakandula, the (older) Rajah Ache and the (younger) Rajah Sulayman.

On May 18, 1571, the native nobility of Luzon, Rajah Sulayman, Rajah Matanda, and Lakandula, acknowledged the sovereignty of Spain over the islands and proclaimed themselves to be vassals of Spain. On the following day, May 19, Legazpi landed in Manila and took ceremonial possession of the land in the presence of Soliman, Matanda, and Lakandula.

Lakandula helped establish a house for Legazpi and build a fort for the Spaniards, giving them fourteen pieces of artillery and twelve jars of gunpowder, a gift much appreciated by the Spaniards, who were running low on ammunition.

Soon after, the Lakandula and his sons were baptized as Catholics. Bunao Lakandula took on the name &quot;Don Carlos Lacandola&quot; after Charles I of Spain. To celebrate the event, the Spanish discharged Manila&#x27;s artillery and arquebuses as part of the ceremony.

==The Battle of Bangkusay, June 1571==
When the Spaniards first came to Manila they were kindly accepted, but over time the natives understood that it had meant subservience to them. It was not long before Spanish power in Luzon was challenged. A first battle took place on May 24, 1570, where the natives were defeated. A month later, Tarik Sulayman of Macabebe attacked Manila, convincing Rajah Sulayman to join the battle against Legazpi. Macabebe and Sulayman&#x27;s forces were defeated, and the Datu of Macabebe was killed in what history would record as the Battle of Bangkusay Channel. (The similarity of names has caused some confusion between these two leaders, but Tarik Sulayman and Rajah Sulayman were different individuals – one survived the battle, and the other did not.)

Lakandula had refused to join Macabebe and Sulayman&#x27;s coalition, but among the prisoners taken by the Spaniards after the battle were two of his nephews and a number of his officers. When questioned, they said that they had been on the scene only as observers, not as combatants. Legazpi let them go to demonstrate his confidence in Lakandula.

Joaquin notes that this was a wise choice on Legazpi&#x27;s part: &quot;If he had been playing a double game before, Lakandula now became earnest in supporting the Spanish. It may be he who persuaded the fugitive Soliman to surrender and return to the good graces of Legazpi.&quot;

==Expedition to Pampanga and Bulacan, late 1571==
Later that year, Legaspi sent Martin de Goiti to spread Spanish rule to the peoples of what are now the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga, particularly the territories of Lubao with Macabebe, Guagua on September 14, 1571. One month later they conquered Calumpit and Malolos in November 14 of the same year. Legazpi conceded these settlements under Spanish rule. He sent Lakandula and Sulayman with him, because, as one account has it, &quot;if so great a chief should go with him, when the Tagalogs and Pampangos saw that he had given obedience to His Majesty, they would give it also.&quot;

The account continues: &quot;Lacandola agreed to go, and served with two ships provided at his cost, and distinguished himself by performing much service for His Majesty, and went along so the said Pampangos would give him obedience, as in fact they did.&quot;

These boats were &quot;joangas&quot; (&quot;karakoa&quot;), a type of seacraft capable of carrying 300 men each, which, as Dery points out, were common in Maritime Southeast Asia.

==Attack by Limahong, 1574==
Lakandula&#x27;s close association with the Spanish continued despite Legazpi&#x27;s death on August 20, 1572, and his replacement as governor by Guido de Lavezares, who had been the colony&#x27;s treasurer. The possession of the Islands was unsuccessfully disputed by a rival expedition under the command of Limahong, a Chinese pirate, who had been outlawed by the Celestial Emperor of China. Lakandula was on hand to help repel Limahong when he came to try and sack Manila in 1574. Lakandula was able to raise a rebellion against the Spaniards. The natives of Mindoro Island revolted too but all these disorders were solved by a detachment of soldiers.

==Death==
Mentions of Lakandula&#x27;s death are few, but Scott indicates that he died in 1575, &quot;three years after&quot; Legazpi and Rajah Matanda, who both died in 1572.

Lakandula&#x27;s role as ruler of Tondo was then taken up by his grandnephew, and Rajah Soliman&#x27;s adopted son, Agustin de Legazpi.

Agustin de Legazpi, who was married to the cousin of Sultan Bolkiah, would lead Tondo as a territory under Spanish rule until he rose up against them in 1587–1588 Revolt of the Lakans, and was deposed and killed as a result.

According to Fray Gaspar de San Agustin in &quot;Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas 1565–1615&quot;, as cited by Kimuell-Gabriel (2013), Lakandula had ruled Tondo from an elevated site near Manila bay, facing the shore and fronted by fishermen&#x27;s dwellings. According to local oral histories, this site eventually became the site of the Sto Niño of Tondo Parish church.

==Documentary sources==
Primary documentary sources about Lakandula are sparse, so much so that there has been debate about the actual name of the Lakan. Dery identifies three types of sources regarding Lakandula: 
* direct accounts of Legaspi&#x27;s 1571 conquest, and indirect references from other documents of the period;
* a record group in the Philippine National Archives collectively referred to as the &quot;Lacandola Documents&quot; containing mostly 18th-century genealogical documents; and
* folklore, which &quot;suggests prior lineage where documentation definitively identifies only descendants&quot;.

===Direct accounts and references from period documents===
In his &quot;&quot;Bibliographic Essay&quot; at the end of his book &quot;Barangay:Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society&quot;&quot;, William Henry Scott identifies the three accounts directly detailing the events of Lakandula&#x27;s lifetime:
* An account written by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi himself;
* An account by royal notary Hernando Riquel who was part of Legazpi&#x27;s expedition; and
* a third account which is anonymous, but which Scott suggests is probably written by royal notary Hernando Riquel.

Scott singles this third account out as particularly useful, because it includes careful observations of the islands and people contacted.

Scott also identifies other accounts that do not directly refer to that occasion, but provide additional information about conditions at the time. These include two accounts of the Magellan voyage, reports from the attacks on Borneo in 1578–1579, letters to the king from royal auditor Melchor de Avalos, Reports by later Governors General, passing details in sworn testimony about Augustinian activities (the latter two recorded in Blair and Robertson), Correspondence of Augustinian Fray Martin de Rada, the Relacion accounts of Miguel de Loarca and Juan de Plasencia, and the Boxer Codex, which &quot;can be dated to 1590 on internal evidence.&quot;

==Descendants==

===Children===
His descendants are spread out all across the Kapampangan Region during the Spanish colonial era. Genealogical research by Filipino historian Luciano P. R. Santiago indicate that Lakandula fathered at least five children:
* Don Dionisio Capulong, the Datu of Candaba, the eldest son of Lakandula;
* Don Magat Salamat, who would later rule Tondo with his cousin Agustin de Legazpi after Lakandula died, and who was then executed by the Spanish in 1588 for his role in the Revolt of the Lakans;
* Don Felipe Salonga, the Datu of Pulu;
* Doña Maria Poloin, his only historically recorded daughter, who married Don Juan Alonso Talabos; and
* Don Martin Lakandula who entered the Augustinian Order as a lay brother in 1590.

Other documentary sources also mention a &quot;Don Luis Taclocmao&quot; (or &quot;Salugmoc&quot;), a supposed son Lakandula of who was killed in the 1603 Chinese rebellion, fighting the Chinese rebels.

===Other relations===
Local folk legends recount that Mexico-born conquistador Juan de Salcedo fell in love with an 18-year-old noblewoman called &quot;Dayang-dayang Kandarapa&quot;, who was said to be the niece of Lakandula.

===Later descendants===
In 1990, Filipino historian Luciano P. R. Santiago wrote an article for the Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society which details the identities and life stories of some of the descendants of Lakandula, mostly based on the &quot;Lacandola Documents,&quot; a collection of legal documents held by the Philippine National Archives. Another Filipino historian, Luis Camara Dery, in his 2001 book &quot;A History of the Inarticulate&quot;, notes that a purported 1539 document called the &quot;Will of Fernando Malang Balagtas,&quot; which, although its exact provenance has been determined to be doubtful, corroborates the information from the Lacandola documents. The Lacandola of Arayat came from one of the grandchildren of Lakandula of Tondo named Dola, who is from San Luis, Pampanga. When Dola married, she insisted to use the surname Lacandola for her children to maintain connection with his grandfather from Tondo and partly, to hide from Spanish authorities.She was married to a Spanish mestizo surnamed Reyes.Eventually, the Reyes - Lacandola was married into a Macapagal.

Dery, Scott, and Santiago recount that the privileges accorded to the descendants of Lakandula had been discontinued for a while in the aftermath of Lakandula&#x27;s death, because some of the descendants came into conflict with the Spanish authorities. According to Dery, the Balagtas document recounts that these privileges were restored when a Juan Macapagal, who claimed to be a great grandson of Lakandula (through Dionisio Capulong&#x27;s son Juan Gonzalo Capulong), aided the Spanish authorities in suppressing the 1660 Maniago revolt, the 1660-61 Malong revolt, and the 1661 Almazan revolt, performing his role as Master-of-Camp and Datu of Arayat.

In 1758, &quot;A Gremio de Lakandulas&quot; was created to safeguard the rights and privileges of the Kapampangan descendants of Lakandula as assured by the Spanish crown. During the British invasion of 1762–64, the descendants of Lakandula, concentrated in the province of Pampanga, formed a company of volunteers to fight the British and were granted autonomy by Governor General Simon de Anda.

Macapagal (rare variant: Makapagal) is a Filipino surname derived from the Kapampangan language. By Santiago&#x27;s genealogical reckoning, prominent Lakandula descendants of the 20th century include the former Philippine Presidents Diosdado Macapagal and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, former Philippine Senate President Jovito Salonga, international stage celebrity Lea Salonga, pioneer Filipino industrialist Gonzalo Puyat, and former Philippine Senate President Gil Puyat.

==Legacy==
* The Order of Lakandula is one of the highest honors given by the Republic of the Philippines.
