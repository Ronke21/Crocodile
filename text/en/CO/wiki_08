<doc id="1268203" wikidata="Q1084035" url="?curid=1268203" title="Christian Flag">
<text>The Christian Flag is an ecumenical flag designed in the late 19th century to represent much of Christianity and Christendom. Since its adoption by the United States Federal Council of Churches in 1942, it has had varied usage by congregations of many Christian traditions, including Anglican, Baptist, Congregationalist, Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Moravian, Presbyterian, and Reformed, among others.

The flag has a white field, with a red Latin cross inside a blue canton. The shade of red on the cross symbolizes the blood that Jesus shed on Calvary. The blue represents the waters of baptism as well as the faithfulness of Jesus. The white represents Jesus&#x27; purity. The dimensions of the flag and canton have no official specifications.

==Origins==

The Christian Flag was first conceived on September 26, 1897, at Brighton Chapel on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York in the United States. The superintendent of a Sunday school, Charles C. Overton, gave an impromptu lecture to the gathered students, because the scheduled speaker had failed to arrive for the event. He gave a speech asking the students what a flag representing Christianity would look like. Overton thought about his improvised speech for many years afterward.

In 1907, Overton and Ralph Diffendorfer, secretary of the Methodist Young People&#x27;s Missionary Movement, designed and began promoting the flag. With regard to the Christian symbolism of the Christian Flag:

The ecumenical organization, Federal Council of Churches (now succeeded by the National Council of Churches and Christian Churches Together) adopted the flag on 23 January 1942, 45 years after unofficial use since 1897; the Federal Council of Churches represented Baptist, Brethren, Eastern Orthodox, Episcopal, Methodist, Moravian, Lutheran, Oriental Orthodox, Polish National Catholic, Presbyterian, Quaker, and Reformed traditions, among others. The Christian Flag intentionally has had no copyright or trademark rights connected to it, as the designer freely dedicated the flag to all of Christendom. Fanny Crosby wrote the words to a hymn called &quot;The Christian Flag&quot; with music by R. Huntington Woodman. Like the flag, the hymn is free use. On the Sunday nearest September 26, 1997, the Christian Flag celebrated its one hundredth anniversary.

==Usage==

Mainline Protestant denominations in the United States accepted the flag first, and by the 1980s many institutions had described policies for displaying it inside churches. The Federal Council of Churches recommended that if the Christian Flag is to be used alongside a national flag, that the Christian Flag should receive the place of honor. During World War II the flag was flown along with the US flag in a number of Lutheran churches, many of them with German backgrounds, who wanted to show solidarity with the United States during the war against Nazi Germany.

The Christian Flag spread outside North America with Christian missionaries. It can be seen today in or outside many Christian churches throughout the world, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. By the 1930s the flag had been adopted by some Protestant churches in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well.

The Christian Flag is not patented and therefore, &quot;Anyone may manufacture it, and it may be used on all proper occasions.&quot;

In Canada and the United States, accommodationists and separationists have entered impassioned debate on the legality of erecting the Christian Flag atop governmental buildings.

==Pledge==
Some churches and organizations in the USA practice a &quot;pledge of allegiance&quot; or &quot;affirmation of loyalty&quot; to the Christian Flag, which is similar to the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag. The first pledge was written by Lynn Harold Hough, a Methodist minister who had heard Ralph Diffendorfer, secretary to the Methodist Young People&#x27;s Missionary Movement, promoting the Christian flag at a rally. He wrote the following pledge:

Some more conservative evangelical, Lutheran, Adventist, and Baptist churches and schools may use an alternative version of the pledge: 

An alternate version that some Lutheran schools use is this:

Others use this version:

For the Christian Flag Pledge, it is customary to stand with the right hand over the heart.

==Anthem==
The anthem of the Christian Flag was written in 1903 by Fanny Crosby:

&lt;poem&gt;
The Christian Flag! Behold It,
And Hail It With A Song,
And Let The Voice Of Millions
The Joyful Strain Prolong,
To Every Clime And Nation,
We Send It Forth Today;
God Speed Its Glorious Mission,
With Earnest Hearts We Pray.

Refrain
The Christian Flag! Behold It,
And Hail It With A Song,
And Let The Voice Of Millions
The Joyful Strain Prolong.

The Christian Flag! Unfurl It,
That All The World May See
The Bloodstained Cross Of Jesus,
Who Died To Make Us Free.
The Christian Flag! Unfurl It,
And O’er And O’er Again,
Oh! May It Bear The Message,
&quot;Good Will And Peace To Men.&quot;

The Christian Flag! God Bless It!
Now Throw It To The Breeze,
And May It Wave Triumphant
O’er Land And Distant Seas,
Till All The Wide Creation
Upon Its Folds Shall Gaze,
And All The World United,
Our Loving Saviour Praise.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1268205" wikidata="Q6880514" url="?curid=1268205" title="Misty (satellite program)">
<text>Misty is reportedly the name of a classified project by the United States National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to operate stealthy reconnaissance satellites. The satellites are conjectured to be photo reconnaissance satellites and the program has been the subject of atypically public debates about its worthiness in the defense budget since December 2004. The estimated project costs in 2004 were, at the time of statement, US$9.5 billion (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ).

== Launches ==
The first satellite (USA-53 or 1990-019B, 19,600 kg) launched for the program was deployed on 1 March 1990 by the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; as part of Mission STS-36. Objects associated with the satellite decayed on 31 March 1990, but the satellite was seen and tracked later that year and in the mid-1990s by amateur observers. The second satellite (USA-144 or 1999-028A ) was launched on 22 May 1999, and by 2004 the launch of a third satellite was planned for 2009. Circumstantial evidence suggested that the third satellite might be the payload of the Delta IV Heavy launch designated NROL-15, which was launched in June 2012.

== Criticism ==
Porter Goss, a former Congressman and former CIA director, and George Tenet, former CIA director, have both vigorously supported successors to Misty, despite several attempts by Senators Dianne Feinstein and John D. Rockefeller IV to terminate the program. The primary contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems.

On 21 June 2007, the Associated Press reported that Director of National Intelligence John Michael McConnell had cancelled the Misty program. A spokesperson for McConnell confirmed that McConnell has the authority to cancel projects, but declined to comment further.

<text>The Mesquite Independent School District is a school district in Mesquite, Texas (USA) (incorporating most of Mesquite and portions of Balch Springs, Dallas, Garland, and Seagoville, as well as formerly serving all high school students of Sunnyvale) which follows the standard definition of an independent school district.

The district contains over 38,000 students. There are five main high schools, Two of which are AAAAAA (or 6A, the highest in a system of Texas school size classification). As of March 8, 2022, the superintendent is Dr. Ángel Rivera.

All houses and residential areas in Mesquite ISD are each assigned to an elementary school (Pre-K-5 or K-5), a middle school (6-8), and a high school (9-12).

In addition, the MISD operates two high school football facilities for its high schools, Memorial Stadium near West Mesquite High School (which is the largest high-school football stadium in Texas, seating nearly 20,000 ) and E. H. Hanby Stadium, which is located adjacent to Mesquite High School.

In 2009, the school district was rated &quot;Recognized&quot; by the Texas Education Agency.

==Demographics==

In 1997, 70.6% of the students were non-Hispanic white; of the four large suburban majority-white suburban school districts in the county, MISD had the highest percentage of white students. From that year to 2016 the number had declined by 68%, making it the most severe decline of the four districts.

From 1997 to 2016 the number of students on free or reduced lunches, a way of classifying a student as low income, increased by 266%.

==Boundary==
The district, in Dallas County, includes most of Mesquite and portions of Balch Springs, Dallas, Garland, and Seagoville.

Before 2009, Sunnyvale Independent School District sent high school students to North Mesquite High School in MISD.

==Standardized dress and dress codes==
The district has implemented standardized dress (similar to a school uniform) for middle and high school students, which started with the 2005 to 2006 school year. The districtwide dress code also dictates hair length and acceptable hair styles of male students. It was one of the first Dallas-area school districts to implement a formal dress code, and Karel Holloway of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; wrote in 2009 that &quot;The district is well-known for its conservative standards for dress&quot;. In the 1970s the district sent a boy home from school because his hair touched his collar. This caused national attention.

==Radio station KEOM 88.5==
Mesquite ISD operates an FM radio station called KEOM 88.5. This is the largest student radio station in the nation

<doc id="1268213" wikidata="Q738911" url="?curid=1268213" title="Arthur Phillips">
<text>Arthur Phillips (born April 23, 1969) is an American novelist. His books include &quot;Prague&quot; (2002), &quot;The Egyptologist&quot; (2004), &quot;Angelica&quot; (2007), &quot;The Song Is You&quot; (2009), &quot;The Tragedy of Arthur&quot; (2011), and &quot;The King at the Edge of the World&quot; (2020).

==Life==
Arthur Peter Monroe Phillips was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is Jewish. He received a BA in history from Harvard University in 1990. After spending two years in Budapest (1990–1992), he then studied jazz saxophone for four semesters at Berklee College of Music (1992–93).

In several interviews, Phillips has stated he has been a child actor, a jazz musician, a speechwriter, an advertising copywriter for medical devices, and a &quot;dismally failed entrepreneur.&quot;

Phillips lived in Budapest from 1990 to 1992 and in Paris from 2001 to 2003, and now lives in New York. He was featured on the July 27, 2007, episode of &quot;This American Life&quot;, reading his short story &quot;Wenceslas Square.&quot; The story is being produced for film by Amazon Studios, with a script by Phillips, to be directed by Sophia Takal.

Phillips was a five-time champion on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 1997. In 2005, he competed in the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Ultimate Tournament of Champions. He won his opening-round game but lost in the second round.

Phillips is married to film producer Barbara Muschietti.

==Works==

===&quot;Prague&quot; (2002)===
&quot;Prague&quot;, despite its title, is set almost entirely in Budapest, Hungary, primarily in 1990, with an interlude detailing several previous generations of Hungarian history, from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy through the First and Second World Wars.

The main line of the novel follows a group of young Western expatriates through their lives in Budapest. The structure of the novel allows for various tales to be interwoven, producing an ensemble portrait of them and their adopted city, just recovering from decades of Communism, fascism, and war. The novel&#x27;s recurring themes include nostalgia, sincerity and authenticity, and young people&#x27;s first search for meaning in life. The novel was well received commercially and critically, winning Phillips a 2003 Los Angeles Times/Art Seidenbaum Award for Best First Fiction, as well as other honors. 

===&quot;The Egyptologist&quot; (2004)===
&quot;The Egyptologist&quot; is structured as journals, letters, telegrams, and drawings, from several different points of view. The main story is set in 1922 and follows a hopeful explorer who, working near Howard Carter (the man who discovered the tomb of King Tutankhamun), risks more and more of his life and savings on an apparently quixotic effort to find the tomb of an apocryphal Egyptian king.

The book was an international bestseller and critical success in more than two dozen countries. US critics noted Phillips&#x27;s versatility in producing a book so different from his first, and fans of the book included Gary Shteyngart, George Saunders, Elizabeth Peters, and Stephen King. Others, however, most notably Michiko Kakutani of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found the book overlong and confusing.

===&quot;Angelica&quot; (2007)===
&quot;Angelica&quot; is superficially a Victorian ghost story, and won Phillips comparisons to Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, and Stephen King. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&quot; opined that the novel cemented Phillips&#x27; reputation as &quot;one of the best writers in America&quot;.

In the novel, the same events are retold four times from four different perspectives, each section casting doubt on the version that came before, until the reader is left to sort truth from fantasy on his or her own. The novel has been made into a film by Mitchell Lichtenstein with a release date in late 2017.

===&quot;The Song Is You&quot; (2009)===
Phillips&#x27; fourth novel tells the story of a middle-aged man&#x27;s pursuit of a young woman, an Irish pop singer performing in a bar. According to a review at &quot;Bookpage&quot;&quot;Set in New York, the story follows Julian Donahue as he navigates the shadowy, grief-filled world of a parent who has lost a child [...] He&#x27;s consumed by [the singer], but rather than introducing himself as another disposable fan, he becomes a faraway mentor and muse, setting himself on a course that will lead him from New York to Europe.&quot;

The novel was published on April 7, 2009. Preliminary reviews included a blurb from Kurt Andersen and this notice from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;: &quot;Phillips still looks like the best American novelist to have emerged during the present decade.&quot;

<text>Ticao Island is an island with a total land area of . It is one of the three major islands of Masbate province in the Philippines. It is separated from the Bicol Peninsula by the Ticao Pass. The other two major islands are Masbate Island () and Burias Island ().

The island is divided into the municipalities of Batuan, Monreal, San Fernando and its mother-town, San Jacinto.
San Miguel Island is located &quot;just off the northern tip&quot; of Ticao Island.

==Archaeological and ecological landscape and seascape of Ticao==

Ticao island is known as an &quot;archaeological landscape&quot;, possessing thousands of precolonial artifacts such as the Baybayin-inscribed Rizal Stone, Ticao gold spike teeth, burial jars of varying designs and sizes, jade beads, human face rock statues, and the &quot;Ticao petrographs&quot;. Much of the homes in Ticao island use these archaeological finds to design their interiors. The island is also an &quot;ecological frontier&quot; for the conservation of manta rays. The island also possesses a &#x27;rare subspecies&#x27; of Visayan warty pig, that is almost near extinction. &quot;Penelopides panini ticaensis&quot;, or the Ticao hornbill, was a subspecies of the Visayan hornbill (&quot;Penelopides panini&quot;) known to occur only in Ticao Island. It is likely extinct in the island due to deforestation and habitat conversion.

<doc id="1268216" wikidata="Q172949" url="?curid=1268216" title="Mercury(I) chloride">
<text>Mercury(I) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula Hg2Cl2. Also known as the mineral calomel (a rare mineral) or mercurous chloride, this dense white or yellowish-white, odorless solid is the principal example of a mercury(I) compound. It is a component of reference electrodes in electrochemistry.

==History==
The name calomel is thought to come from the Greek &quot;καλός&quot; &quot;beautiful&quot;, and &quot;μέλας&quot; &quot;black&quot;; or &quot;καλός&quot; and &quot;μέλι&quot; &quot;honey&quot; from its sweet taste. The &quot;black&quot; name (somewhat surprising for a white compound) is probably due to its characteristic disproportionation reaction with ammonia, which gives a spectacular black coloration due to the finely dispersed metallic mercury formed. It is also referred to as the mineral &quot;horn quicksilver&quot; or &quot;horn mercury&quot;.

Calomel was taken internally and used as a laxative, for example to treat George III in 1801, and disinfectant, as well as in the treatment of syphilis, until the early 20th century. Until fairly recently, it was also used as a horticultural fungicide, most notably as a root dip to help prevent the occurrence of clubroot amongst crops of the family Brassicaceae.

Mercury became a popular remedy for a variety of physical and mental ailments during the age of &quot;heroic medicine&quot;. It was prescribed by doctors in America throughout the 18th century, and during the revolution, to make patients regurgitate and release their body from &quot;impurities&quot;. Benjamin Rush was a well-known advocate of mercury in medicine and used calomel to treat sufferers of yellow fever during its outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793. Calomel was given to patients as a purgative or cathartic until they began to salivate and was often administered to patients in such great quantities that their hair and teeth fell out.

Yellow fever was also treated with calomel.

Lewis and Clark brought calomel on their expedition. Researchers used that same mercury, found deep in latrine pits, to retrace the locations of their respective locations and campsites.

==Properties==
Mercury is unique among the group 12 metals for its ability to form the M–M bond so readily. Hg2Cl2 is a linear molecule. The mineral calomel crystallizes in the tetragonal system, with space group I4/m 2/m 2/m. The unit cell of the crystal structure is shown below:

The Hg–Hg bond length of 253 pm (Hg–Hg in the metal is 300 pm) and the Hg–Cl bond length in the linear Hg2Cl2 unit is 243 pm. The overall coordination of each Hg atom is octahedral as, in addition to the two nearest neighbours, there are four other Cl atoms at 321 pm. Longer mercury polycations exist.

==Preparation and reactions==
Mercurous chloride forms by the reaction of elemental mercury and mercuric chloride:
:Hg + HgCl2 → Hg2Cl2
It can be prepared via metathesis reaction involving aqueous mercury(I) nitrate using various chloride sources including NaCl or HCl.
:2 HCl + Hg2(NO3)2 → Hg2Cl2 + 2 HNO3
Ammonia causes Hg2Cl2 to disproportionate:
:Hg2Cl2 + 2 NH3 → Hg + Hg(NH2)Cl + NH4Cl

===Calomel electrode===

Mercurous chloride is employed extensively in electrochemistry, taking advantage of the ease of its oxidation and reduction reactions. The calomel electrode is a reference electrode, especially in older publications. Over the past 50 years, it has been superseded by the silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode. Although the mercury electrodes have been widely abandoned due to the dangerous nature of mercury, many chemists believe they are still more accurate and are not dangerous as long as they are handled properly. The differences in experimental potentials vary little from literature values. Other electrodes can vary by 70 to 100 millivolts.

===Photochemistry===
Mercurous chloride decomposes into mercury(II) chloride and elemental mercury upon exposure to UV light.
:Hg2Cl2 → HgCl2 + Hg
The formation of Hg can be used to calculate the number of photons in the light beam, by the technique of actinometry.

By utilizing a light reaction in the presence of mercury(II) chloride and ammonium oxalate, mercury(I) chloride, ammonium chloride and carbon dioxide are produced.
:2 HgCl2 + (NH4)2C2O4 Hg2Cl2(s) + 2 [][Cl−] + 2 CO2

This particular reaction was discovered by J. M. Eder (hence the name Eder reaction) in 1880 and reinvestigated by W. E. Rosevaere in 1929.

==Related mercury(I) compounds==
Mercury(I) bromide, Hg2Br2, is light yellow, whereas mercury(I) iodide, Hg2I2, is greenish in colour. Both are poorly soluble. Mercury(I) fluoride is unstable in the absence of a strong acid.

==Safety considerations==

Mercurous chloride is toxic, although due to its low solubility in water it is generally less dangerous than its mercuric chloride counterpart. It was used in medicine as a diuretic and purgative (laxative) in the United States from the late 1700s through the 1860s. Calomel was also a common ingredient in teething powders in Britain up until 1954, causing widespread mercury poisoning in the form of pink disease, which at the time had a mortality rate of 1 in 10. These medicinal uses were later discontinued when the compound&#x27;s toxicity was discovered.

It has also found uses in cosmetics as soaps and skin lightening creams, but these preparations are now illegal to manufacture or import in many countries including the US, Canada, Japan and the European Union. A study of workers involved in the production of these preparations showed that the sodium salt of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) was effective in lowering the body burden of mercury and in decreasing the urinary mercury concentration to normal levels.

<text>L&#x27;Auberge espagnole (, ), also known as Pot Luck (United Kingdom) and The Spanish Apartment (Australia), is a 2002 romantic comedy-drama film directed and written by Cédric Klapisch. It is a co-production between France and Spain.

In the film, an economics graduate student from France, Xavier, spends a year in Barcelona to study. His fellow Erasmus students are from all over Western Europe and have a flatshare. They each speak different languages and have different cultural standards.

The film is told in the first person by Xavier. The dialogue is mostly in French, with some English and much Spanish, a little Catalan, Danish, German and Italian.

It is the first instalment in the &quot;Spanish Apartment&quot; trilogy, which continues in the sequels &quot;Russian Dolls&quot; (2005) and &quot;Chinese Puzzle&quot; (2013). A television series sequel to the trilogy &quot;Greek Salad&quot; was released in 2023.

==Plot==
Xavier, a 24-year-old economics graduate student from Paris, attends the Erasmus Programme in Barcelona to further his career, against the wishes of his girlfriend Martine. On the flight, Xavier meets a married couple from France, a doctor named Jean-Michel and his wife Anne-Sophie. They invite him to stay in their home while he looks for somewhere to live. Xavier eventually finds a flatshare with students from England, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany and Denmark. The roommates develop a companionship as they struggle with their different languages and cultures.

Martine visits Xavier and returns disappointed when she realizes things are not the same. Xavier begins an affair with Anne-Sophie, using seduction tips learned from Isabelle, his lesbian roommate from Belgium. William arrives from England to visit his sister Wendy and creates tension with his abrasive manner and culturally insensitive comments.

Xavier becomes depressed and hallucinates after Martine breaks up with him. He seeks Jean-Michel&#x27;s advice, but he tells Xavier that his wife has confessed everything, and tells him to stop seeing her.

Discord divides the roommates, but they come together to aid Wendy, who was nearly caught by her boyfriend Alistair in a sexual encounter with an American man.

After saying goodbye to his new close friends, Xavier returns to Paris and gets his desired job at the ministry, but realizes that his experiences in Spain have changed him. He subsequently runs away on his first day on the job and pursues his dream to become a writer, recounting the story of his experiences in the &quot;Auberge Espagnole&quot;. Towards the end, Xavier can be seen getting together with his now ex-girlfriend Martine as well.

==Cast==
==Title==
The phrase &quot;auberge espagnole&quot; is a French idiom, literally translated as &quot;Spanish inn&quot; or &quot;Spanish hotel&quot;. It describes a place where customers can eat what they bring – by extension, that one must be independent.

Another French interpretation is what in English is known as &quot;Going Dutch&quot; or &quot;potluck&quot;, hence its English title.

A third meaning of &quot;auberge espagnole&quot; is a common resting area for travellers from a variety of different cultures and regions.

<text>Gilgul (also Gilgul neshamot or Gilgulei HaNeshamot; Heb. , Plural: &quot;Gilgulim&quot;) is a concept of reincarnation or &quot;transmigration of souls&quot; in Kabbalistic esoteric mysticism. In Hebrew, the word &quot;gilgul&quot; means &quot;cycle&quot; or &quot;wheel&quot; and &quot;neshamot&quot; is the plural for &quot;souls.&quot; Souls are seen to cycle through lives or incarnations, being attached to different human bodies over time. Which body they associate with depends on their particular task in the physical world, spiritual levels of the bodies of predecessors and so on. The concept relates to the wider processes of history in Kabbalah, involving cosmic Tikkun (Messianic rectification), and the historical dynamic of ascending Lights and descending Vessels from generation to generation.

The esoteric explanations of &quot;gilgul&quot; were articulated in Jewish mysticism by Isaac Luria in the 16th century, as part of the metaphysical purpose of Creation.

==History in Jewish thought==
Reincarnation is an esoteric belief within many streams of modern Judaism but is not an essential tenet of traditional Judaism. It is not mentioned in classical sources such as the Hebrew Bible, the classical rabbinic works (Mishnah and Talmud), or Maimonides&#x27; 13 principles of faith. Kabbalah, however, teaches a belief in &quot;gilgul&quot;; hence, the belief is universal in Hasidic Judaism, which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative.

Among well-known rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are Saadia Gaon, David Kimhi, Hasdai Crescas, Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi (early 14th century), Joseph Albo, Abraham ibn Daud, and Leon of Modena. Among the Geonim, Hai ben Sherira argued with Saadia Gaon in favour of &quot;gilgulim&quot;.

Rabbis who believed in the idea of reincarnation include, from Medieval times, the mystical leaders Nahmanides and Bahya ben Asher; from the 16th-century Levi ibn Habib, and from the mystical school of Safed, Solomon Alkabetz, Isaac Luria, and his exponent Hayyim ben Joseph Vital; and from the 18th-century: the founder of Hasidic Judaism, the Baal Shem Tov, later Hasidic Masters, and the Lithuanian Jewish Orthodox leader and Kabbalist the Vilna Gaon; and - amongst others - from the 19th/20th-century: Yosef Hayyim, author of the &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot;.

The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal Safed marked an important development in Kabbalistic thought, with a significant impact on mystical circles and Jewish spirituality. It was also the time when Kabbalah was most widely disseminated. In this context, Isaac Luria taught new explanations of the process of &quot;gilgul&quot; and identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures, which Hayyim ben Joseph Vital compiled in his &quot;Shaar HaGilgulim&quot;.

&quot;Shaar haGilgulim&quot; lists possible reincarnations: &quot;One who has sexual relations with an animal is reincarnated as a bat, one who has relations with a menstruant non-Jewish woman, one who commits adultery is reincarnated as a donkey, with his mother as a she-ass, with a man as a rabbit or hare&quot;. Tzaddikim can reincarnate as a fish, because &quot;fish do not have to be ritually slaughtered before being rectified via eating&quot;. David Roskies in &quot;The Shtetl Book&quot; mentions the following beliefs: &quot;The soul of a tsadek becomes the soul of a fish. The soul of a butcher who eats treyf meat becomes the soul of a black crow. The soul of a dishonest khazn becomes the soul of a dog. Because his prayer was as pleasing to the Lord as a dog’s bark. The soul of an informer becomes that of parrot. Because he acted like a parrot: spoke the wrong things at the wrong time to the wrong people.&quot; According to &quot;Shaar haGilgulim&quot;, a soul can even reincarnate in an inanimate object like a stone.

Historian Nathaniel Deutsch mentioned a widely reported anecdote as a modern example of the gilgul belief. In 2003, two fish cutters claimed to have encountered a talking carp at the New Square Fish Market in Rockland County, New York. The incident occurred in a Hasidic community of about 7,000 members. &quot;The story goes that a 20-pound carp about to be slaughtered and made into gefilte fish for Sabbath dinner began speaking in Hebrew, shouting apocalyptic warnings and claiming to be the troubled soul of a revered community elder who recently died.&quot;

<text>Two by Twos (also known as 2x2, The Truth and The Way) is an international, home-based Christian new religious movement that was founded in 1897 in Ireland by William Irvine. Irvine, an evangelist with the interdenominational Faith Mission, began independently preaching that the itinerant ministry outlined in Matthew 10 remains the only valid method of evangelism. Church growth was rapid, spreading outside Ireland. Irvine eventually began preaching a new order in which the hierarchy developed within the church would have no placement. This teaching became controversial within the church, leading to his expulsion by church overseers around 1914. One of the church&#x27;s most prominent evangelists, Edward Cooney, was expelled a decade after Irvine. The church then became much less visible to outsiders for the next half-century. The publication of several articles and books, increased news coverage, and the appearance of the Internet have since opened the church to wider scrutiny.

Some in the church assert it is a direct continuation of the 1st-century Christian church. Others in the church believe that a restoration occurred in the late 19th century. Ministers are itinerant and work in pairs, hence the name &quot;Two by Twos&quot;. Members hold regular twice-weekly worship gatherings in local homes on Sunday and midweek. The church also holds annual regional conventions for members and public Gospel meetings. Baptism by immersion, as performed by one of the church&#x27;s workers, is required to partake in the emblems of bread and wine at the fellowship gathering. The orthodox Christian Trinitarian doctrine is rejected. Doctrine of the church teaches that salvation is reached by attending the group&#x27;s home meetings, accepting the preaching of its itinerant, unsalaried ministry workers, and &quot;professing&quot;. The church teaches that salvation is not achieved through faith alone but only through a combination of faith and &quot;works.&quot; Works are considered acts of self-denial such as wearing modest skirts and long hair in a bun or attending all meetings regardless of how far away they are. The church does not do any outreach programs or encourage its members to participate in charities.

The church does not have official headquarters or publications. It does not explicitly publish any doctrinal statements, insisting that such tenets may only be directly imparted orally by its ministers, referred to as &quot;workers.&quot; Its hymnbook and various other materials for internal use are produced by outside publishers and printing firms. Printed invitations and advertisements for its open gospel services are the only written materials that those outside the church are likely to encounter.

Among members, the church is usually referred to as &quot;The Truth&quot;, &quot;Meetings&quot;, or &quot;the workers and friends&quot;, but members deny an official church name. Those outside the church refer to it as &quot;Two by Twos&quot;, &quot;The Black Stockings&quot;, &quot;No-name Church&quot;, &quot;Cooneyites&quot;, &quot;Workers and Friends&quot;, or &quot;Christians Anonymous&quot;, and journalists sometimes call it &quot;2x2&quot; for short. The church&#x27;s various registered names include &quot;Christian Conventions&quot; in the United States, &quot;Assemblies of Christians&quot; and &quot;The Alberta Society of Christian Assemblies&quot; in Canada (dissolved only after it was exposed), &quot;The Testimony of Jesus&quot; in the United Kingdom, &quot;Kristna i Sverige&quot; in Sweden, and &quot;United Christian Conventions&quot; in Australia. These registered names are used only for specific purposes (for instance, to register conscientious objection during war) and are not routinely used by members.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In 1896, William Irvine was sent from Scotland to southern Ireland as a missionary by John George Govan&#x27;s Faith Mission, an interdenominational organization with roots in the Holiness movement. Because his mission was successful, he was promoted to superintendent of Faith Mission in southern Ireland.

Within a few months of his arrival in Ireland, Irvine was already disillusioned with the Faith Mission. There was friction over its Holiness teachings, and Irvine saw its organization as a violation of his concept of a faith-based ministry. Above all, Irvine was increasingly intolerant of the Faith Mission&#x27;s cooperation with the other churches and clergy in the various communities of southern Ireland, regarding converts who joined churches as &quot;lost among the clergy.&quot; In 1897, he began preaching independently, proclaiming that true ministers must have no home and take no salary. He became convinced that he had received this as a special revelation he referred to as his &quot;Alpha message&quot;. Opposed to all other established churches, he held that the manner in which the disciples had been sent out in chapter 10 of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; was a permanent commandment which must still be observed. The passage reads in part:

In October 1897, Irvine was invited by Nenagh businessman John &quot;Jack&quot; Carroll to preach in the Carrolls&#x27; hometown of Rathmolyon. There he held a series of mission meetings in which all established churches were rejected, and Irvine&#x27;s new doctrine and method of ministry were set forth. It was in Rathmolyon that he recruited the first adherents to his new message. Aside from condemning all other churches, Irvine&#x27;s doctrine included the rejection of church buildings, damnation of all followers of churches outside the new fellowship, rejection of paid ministry, rejection of collections during services and collection boxes, and the requirement that those seeking to join the ministry &quot;sell all&quot;.

Irvine&#x27;s preaching during this latest mission influenced others who began to leave their respective churches and join Irvine to form an initial core of followers. Some of these early adherents would become important members of the new church, including John Long, the Carroll family, John Kelly, Edward Cooney—an influential evangelist from the Church of Ireland—and George Walker (an employee of the Cooney family&#x27;s fabric business), all of whom eventually &quot;sold all&quot; and joined the new movement as itinerant preachers. Although other movements, such as the Plymouth Brethren and Elim have had strong Irish connections, the church founded by Irvine is the only religion known to have had its origin and early development in Ireland.

=== Early growth ===
Unlike later secretiveness, initially, the church was in the public eye, with questions about it being raised in the British Parliament beginning in 1900. Inspired by speakers such as Irvine and Cooney, membership growth was rapid. Rather than adding members to established denominations, as was the practice of the Faith Mission outreach, churches began noticing their congregations thinning after exposure to the Two by Two missions. Clerics soon began regarding the Two by Two preachers as &quot;inimical to the membership of the church&quot;. After receiving reports from Ireland, the Faith Mission in 1900 formally disassociated itself from Irvine and any of its workers found to be participating in the new Two by Two movement.

The attention of Belfast newspapers was initially drawn to the Two by Twos church because of its open-air baptismal rites. At that time, the baptisms took place in public settings such as streams, lakes, or the sea, even in cold weather. Regarded as a novelty, the outdoor &quot;dippings&quot; and accompanying sermons attracted large crowds. Further attention was given during the staging of large marches through boroughs and public preaching in town squares and on street corners.

Workers, including Edward Cooney and George Walker, publicly preached that all members of other churches were damned. They singled out prominent individuals, and even entire communities, for condemnation. At times, missions were sited close to the meeting places of other denominations, which were denounced using &quot;extreme language&quot;. Consequences of these inflammatory remarks ranged from heckling and street violence to the break-up of families, all of which brought further attention to the church. Newspapers in Ireland, Britain, and North America followed the disturbances that arose over the church&#x27;s activities and message. Some hosted debates in their editorial columns. One member of Parliament offered to join the Two by Twos if they would cease criticizing other religious bodies.

As the ranks of its ministry increased, the church&#x27;s outreach expanded. Large gatherings were held in Dublin, Glasgow and Belfast during 1899. Annual conventions, modeled after the evangelical Keswick Conventions in England, began to be held regularly in Ireland starting in 1903. Later that year, William Irvine, accompanied by Irvine Weir and George Walker, took his message to North America. Missions to continental Europe, Australia, and Asia followed.

By 1904, the requirement to &quot;sell all&quot; was no longer mentioned in sermons. A two-tiered system was instituted that made a distinction between homeless itinerant missionaries (called &quot;workers&quot;) and those who were now allowed to retain homes and jobs (called &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;saints&quot;). Weekly home meetings began to be held and presided over by &quot;elders&quot;, who were typically the householder. During the next few years, this change became universal. The church continued to grow rapidly and held regular annual conventions lasting several weeks at a time. Irvine traveled widely during this period, attending conventions and preaching worldwide, and began sending workers from the British Isles to follow up and expand interest in various areas.

Beginning in 1906, unwelcome attention came in the form of leaflets and billboard notices. W. D. Wilson, an English farmer whose unmarried children had left home and joined the Two by Twos, began publishing articles stating girls were being recruited by the church for immoral purposes. In response, Edward Cooney brought a widely publicized suit for libel that was resolved by a settlement between the parties by the end of 1913.

A hierarchy was instituted by Irvine, and his most trusted associates in various regions were designated as &quot;overseers&quot; or &quot;head workers&quot;. Each worker was assigned a particular geographical sphere and then coordinated the efforts of the ministry within his area. Among the overseers were William and Jack Carroll, George Walker, and Willie Gill. Irvine continued to have the ultimate say over worker conduct and finances, and his activities within their fields became regarded as &quot;interference.&quot; Except for such annual conventions as he was able to attend across the globe, communications and instructions from Irvine passed through the overseers.

=== Schism ===
William Irvine&#x27;s progressive revelation continued to evolve over this time, and eschatological themes began to appear in sermons. By 1914, he had begun to preach that the Age of Grace, during which his &quot;Alpha Gospel&quot; had been proclaimed, was coming to a close. As his message turned towards indicating a new era, which held no place for the ministry and hierarchy that had rapidly grown up around the &quot;Alpha Gospel,&quot; resentment arose on the part of overseers who saw him as a threat to their positions.

Australian overseer John Hardie was the first to break with Irvine and excluded him from speaking at the South Australia convention in late 1913. As 1914 progressed, he was excluded from speaking in a growing number of regions, as more overseers broke away from him. Rumors circulated about Irvine&#x27;s comfortable lifestyle and supposed weakness for women, though nothing concrete was ever exposed. It was put about that Irvine &quot;had lost the Lord&#x27;s anointing&quot; in an effort to explain his ouster. He was shunned and his name was no longer mentioned, making him a nonperson in the church he founded. There were many excommunications of Irvine loyalists in various fields during the following years, and by 1919, the split was final, with Irvine moving to Jerusalem and transmitting his &quot;Omega Message&quot; to his core followers from there. Lacking any organizational means of making his case before the membership, Irvine&#x27;s ouster occurred quietly. Most members continued following the overseers, and few outside the leadership knew the details behind Irvine&#x27;s disappearance from the scene, as no public mention of the split seems to have been made. Mention of Irvine&#x27;s name was forbidden, and a new explanation of the group&#x27;s history was introduced from which Irvine&#x27;s role was erased.

Although the threat posed by Irvine to the church&#x27;s organization had been dealt with, the prominent worker Edward Cooney refused to place his evangelistic efforts under the control of the overseers. Cooney himself adhered to the earlier, unfettered style of itinerant ministry, moving about wherever he felt he was needed. He rejected the appointment of head workers to geographic regions and criticized their lifestyles. He also preached against the &quot;Living Witness&quot; doctrine (i.e., that salvation entails hearing the gospel preached directly by a worker and seeing the gospel made alive in the sacrificial lives of the ministry), the bank accounts controlled by the overseers, use of halls for meetings, conventions, the hierarchy that had developed, and the ministry and the registrations under official names. For a time, his message urging a return to the original principles of Matthew 10 gained a following, even among some Australian overseers.

A second division occurred in 1928 when Edward Cooney was expelled for criticizing the hierarchy and other elements that had arisen within the church, which he saw as serious deviations from the church&#x27;s original message. The overseers seized upon a failed attempt at performing a faith healing as a pretext to excommunicate him. Cooney&#x27;s loyal supporters joined him, including some of the early workers, and they stayed faithful to what they perceived to be the original tenets. The term &quot;Cooneyite&quot; today chiefly refers to the group which separated (or were excommunicated) along with Cooney and who continue as an independent group. Prior to the schism, onlookers had labeled the entire movement as &quot;Cooneyites&quot; due to Edward Cooney&#x27;s prominence in the early growth of the church. There are areas where this older usage continues.

=== Consolidation ===
These schisms were not widely publicized, and few were aware that they had occurred. Most supporters of Irvine, and later Cooney, were either coaxed into abandoning those loyalties or put out of the fellowship. Among these were the early workers May Carroll, Irvine Weir (one of the first workers in North America, who was excommunicated for continued contact with Cooney and for his objection to registration of the church under names), and Tom Elliot (who had conducted baptisms of the first workers and was nicknamed &quot;Tom the Baptist&quot;).

The emergence of the Two by Twos caused severe splits within local Protestant churches in Ireland at a time of increasing demands for Irish independence, largely driven by the Catholic majority community. Because of animosity, the Two by Twos did not form a united front with other Protestant communities. Although the church was noted for extreme anti-Catholic views, it played a very minor role during the struggle for Irish independence. One exception was the involvement of the Pearson family in the still-controversial killings at Coolacrease.

In the mid-1920s, a magazine article entitled &quot;The Cooneyites or Go-Preachers&quot; disturbed the leadership, who made efforts to have it withdrawn, particularly when material from the article was added to the widely distributed reference &quot;Heresies Exposed&quot;. During this period, the church modified its evangelical outreach. The public preaching of its early days was replaced with low-key &quot;gospel meetings&quot;, which were attended only by members and invitees. The church began to state that it had a 1st-century origin. It asserted that it had no organization or name and disclaimed any unique doctrines. The church shunned publicity, making the church very difficult for outsiders to follow.

The North American church saw a struggle for influence between overseers George Walker in the east and Jack Carroll. In 1928, an agreement was forged between the senior overseers that limited workers operating outside of their appointed geographical spheres, known as &quot;fields&quot;: workers traveling into an area controlled by another overseer had to first submit their revelation to, and obtain permission from, the local overseer. The exact boundaries between fields was worked out over time, and there were areas where workers under the control of more than one overseer operated, causing conflict.

During the First World War, the church obtained exemption from military service in Britain under the name &quot;The Testimony of Jesus.&quot; However, there were problems with recognition of this name outside the British Isles, and exemption was refused in many other areas. In New Zealand during World War I, members of the church could not prove their conscientious objector status, and formed the largest segment of those imprisoned for refusal to serve. Members and ministers also had difficulty establishing their conscientious objector status in the United States during the First World War. With the start of the Second World War, formal names were adopted and used in registering the church with various national governments. These names continued to be used for official business, and stationery bearing those names was printed for the use of overseers. Most members were not aware of these names. Some who dissented after learning of the practice were expelled by the workers.

After the death of Australian overseer William Carroll in 1953, an attempt was made to reintegrate the repudiated adherents of William Irvine and Edward Cooney. Rather than producing further unity, the attempt produced conflicts over the church&#x27;s history which was exposed, the existence of legal names, disagreements over the hierarchy which had developed, and other controversies. Many excommunications took place in the subsequent effort to enforce harmony.

The earliest workers and overseers were succeeded by a new generation of leaders. In Europe, William Irvine died in 1947, Edward Cooney died in 1960, and John Long (expelled in 1907) died in 1962. British overseer Willie Gill died in 1951. In the South Pacific, New Zealand overseer Wilson McClung died in 1944, and Australian overseer John Hardie died in 1961. In North America, both Jack Carroll, the Western overseer, and Irvine Weir died in 1957 while Eastern overseer George Walker died in 1981.

Its policy of not revealing its name, finances, doctrine, or history, and avoidance of publicity largely kept the church from public notice. A few authors of popular literature have noted the church, even using it as background for various works.

=== Into the 21st century; abuse cases ===

Divisions, both doctrinal and organizational, within the group have formed throughout its history and continue as ongoing challenges.

Until the mid 1980s, notes regarding the Two by Twos had appeared infrequently in religious journals and sociological works, with some writers assuming that the church had greatly declined, with nothing published regarding it. In 1982, the publication of &quot;The Secret Sect&quot; was followed by press reports and public statements by former members. Other books and news coverage dealing with the church appeared in the following decades and increased awareness of the church and its practices. With the exposure of regional differences and the appearance of dissent, a loosening of a few strict standards demanded of members has been observed in some areas. A marked decline in membership has occurred over recent decades, coinciding with availability of information on the Internet and elsewhere.

In April 2019, the Australian current affairs television show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interviewed child sex abuse victims of Australian ministers. On 20 March 2023, a letter was released from overseer Doyle S. Smith, (the &quot;Dean Letter&quot;) informing members of the discovery of predatory and sexually abusive behavior by recently deceased worker and overseer Dean Bruer. Since the release of the Dean Letter, other allegations of sexual abuse and child sexual abused have been reported within the church from all over the world, and former minister Robert Corfield admitted that he had sexually abused a boy in Saskatchewan, Canada, over several years in the 1980s. Numbers of perpetrators have been estimated to number in the hundreds, with several thousand victims identified. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened an investigation in 2024.

In 2023, the Two by Twos&#x27; Australasian overseers had issued two letters to members acknowledging incidents of abuse overseas, condemning child abuse and encouraging victims to report abuse to the police. The overseers also announced they would establish an anonymous advisory group to develop child-safe policies and manage the group&#x27;s response to historical child sexual abuse. In other areas, calls for adoption of an official policy have been rejected or ignored. In May 2024, the group&#x27;s Australasian leaders launched a website with information about their response to historical child sexual abuse and a written apology to victims. Former abuse victims and victim advocate Jillian Hishon have criticized the group&#x27;s response for lacking impartiality and accountability.

In June 2024, the American Broadcasting Company television news program &quot;Nightline&quot; aired a segment on child sexual abuse cases across the United States. An expanded report aired concurrently on season 2 of the Hulu docuseries &quot;Impact X Nightline&quot;.

In September 2024, Radio New Zealand reported that New Zealand Police were assisting the FBI investigation by investigating at least one former New Zealand minister for historical abuse. A former minister William Stephen Easton admitted 55 child sex abuse charges over three decades against young boys. The church has about 2,500 members and 60 ministers in New Zealand. Peter Lineham of Massey University has been researching the group since the 1970s and said that it had been active in New Zealand for 120 years.

An American former elder of the church, Raymond Zwiefelhofer, was sentenced to 120 years in prison in November, 2024, for 10 counts of possessing child sexual abuse material. A report published by the BBC in early 2025 covered allegations of women who were pressured into giving up their children for adoption.

== Doctrine ==
Apart from their hymnals, officially published documentation or church statements are scarce, making it difficult to speak in depth about its beliefs. Some former members and critics of the church have made statements about its beliefs, although these points have rarely been publicly responded to by any authorities within the church.

All the church&#x27;s teachings are expressed orally, and the church does not publish doctrine or statements of faith. Workers hold that all church teachings are based solely on the Bible. A catchphrase frequently used to describe the church is: &quot;The church in the home, and the ministry without a home.&quot; Church members and &quot;workers&quot; will publicly declare that the church does not own any buildings. This is not strictly true: in fact, church members own rural or semi-rural properties dedicated to worship, housing workers, and church gatherings, including conventions and &quot;special meetings&quot;. The concept of church buildings is still seen as inconsistent with &quot;biblical Christianity&quot; and was strongly denounced by early workers. Its ministers do not own homes or earn salaries. The church has upheld these practices since its inception. Notwithstanding this tradition, buildings specially constructed or repurposed for the use of the church do exist, including convention buildings, meeting halls, tents, caravans, and portable halls. Rural properties are primarily held and maintained on behalf of the church by certain members. However, in recent years, a Northern Irish investment vehicle has been used to purchase English convention property. A dedicated church building was constructed in Canada early on, but eventually was rejected by Irvine.

The King James Bible is the only scripture used in English-language services. The Bible itself is held as insufficient for salvation unless its words are &quot;made alive&quot; through the preaching of church ministers. The extemporaneous preaching of the ministry is considered to be guided by God and must be heard directly. Great weight is given to the thoughts of workers, especially more senior workers. Salvation is achieved through willingness to uphold the church&#x27;s standards, by faithfully following in &quot;the way&quot;, and by personal worthiness. Doctrines such as predestination, original sin, justification by faith alone, and redemption as the sole basis of salvation are rejected. The church is exclusivist — all other churches, religions, and ministries are held to be false, and salvation is only obtainable through the Two by Two ministry and meetings.

Salvation is deemed to require self-sacrifice in following the example and commandments of Jesus and suffering is revered. Members are encouraged to attend meetings, publicly pray, and testify at them. Although the church has roots in the Holiness movement and has inherited some of its features, charismatic elements are suppressed. Other standards include modest dress, not wearing jewelry, long hair for women and short hair for men, not getting piercings, not dying hair, not getting a tattoo, and avoiding activities deemed to be worldly or frivolous (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, watching television, and viewing motion pictures). Standards and practices vary geographically: for example, in some areas, wine is used in Sunday meetings; in other areas, grape juice is used; in some areas, people who have divorced and remarried are not allowed to participate in meetings, particularly women, while in others they may. The use of television, social media sites, and other mass media is discouraged in some areas, based on the stance of the local workers and overseers. Some external standards in dress and conduct have been loosened in recent years in response to criticisms. While rules are not strictly &#x27;enforced&#x27; and vary between families, the church ultimately values complete and total dedication to the doctrine. It encourages members to denounce other aspects of their lives. The church has actively condemned pre-marital relations and LGBTQ identities.

=== Christology ===
The church has rejected the doctrine of the Trinity since its inception. Though members believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, they hold a Unitarian view of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is held as an attitude or force from God. Jesus is God&#x27;s son, a fully human figure who came to earth to establish a way of ministry and salvation, but not God himself. Great stress is laid upon the &quot;example life&quot; of Jesus as a pattern for the ministry.

=== Baptism ===
Baptism by one of the church&#x27;s ministers is considered a necessary step for salvation and full participation, including re-baptism of persons baptized by other churches. Candidates approved by the local workers are baptized by immersion. Baptisms are often scheduled for one morning during a Convention and are typically performed in small ponds on the property. Families and onlookers gather, pray, and sing hymns during the ceremony, as led by a worker.

=== Church name ===
The church represents itself as nondenominational and without a name. Those outside the church often use descriptive terms such as &quot;Two by Twos&quot; (from their method of sending out ministers in pairs), &quot;No-name Church&quot;, &quot;Cooneyites&quot;, &quot;Workers and Friends&quot;, &quot;disciples of Jesus&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Go-preachers&quot;, and &quot;Tramp Preachers,&quot; among other titles. The new movement was initially called &quot;Tramp Preachers&quot; or &quot;Tramp Pilgrims&quot; by observers. During the early years, they called themselves by the name &quot;Go-Preachers&quot;. By 1904, the terms &quot;Cooneyism&quot; and &quot;Cooneyite&quot; had been coined in those areas in which Edward Cooney established churches and where he was a vocal promoter. The term &quot;Two by Twos&quot; was in use in Canada by the early 1920s and in the United States by the 1930s. In Germany, bynames for the church have included &quot;Die Namenlosen&quot; (the Nameless), &quot;Wahre Christen&quot; (True Christians), &quot;Jünger Jesu&quot; (Disciples of Jesus), and &quot;Freunde&quot; (Friends). In France, they have been known as &quot;Les Anonymes&quot; (the Anonymous, or No-names).

Though overseers and head workers use registered names when necessary to conduct official business, most members do not associate a formal name with the church. Instead, they refer to the church as &quot;The Truth,&quot; &quot;The Way,&quot; &quot;The Jesus Way,&quot; or &quot;The Lowly Way.&quot; Few members are aware that the church has taken official names used for church business, including seeking military exemptions. Registered names vary from nation to nation. In the United States, the name used is &quot;Christian Conventions&quot;, but in Canada, &quot;Assemblies of Christians&quot; is used. In Britain, it is &quot;the Testimony of Jesus&quot;, and in Sweden the registered name is &quot;Kristna I Sverige&quot;. &quot;United Christian Conventions&quot; has been used in Australia and other nations (Australian members previously adopted the name &quot;Testimony of Jesus&quot; during World War I, and registered as &quot;Christian Assemblies&quot; during World War II). The church was also incorporated in Victoria, Australia, as a charity from 1929 until 2019 and held property in trust. In 1995, controversy arose in Alberta, Canada, when part of the church incorporated as the &quot;Alberta Society of Christian Assemblies&quot;. That entity was dissolved in 1996 after its existence became generally known.

=== Restorationism ===
Many church members hold to a long-standing view that the church has no earthly founder, and that only they represent the &quot;true Christian Church&quot; originating directly with Christ during the 1st century AD. Some members have more recently made statements which diverge from that view and hint either at a beginning during the closing years of the 19th century or at a notable resurgence or restoration around that time.

=== Terminology ===
The following are terms used by the church with the definitions giving the sense commonly intended and understood by members.
: Generally refers to a small local group that meets in a home; can refer to a larger group of believers. This term is never used to refer to a building except for church buildings of other denominations. Used colloquially when talking to strangers to refer to Sunday/Wednesday activity, e.g., &quot;I&#x27;ll be at church until midday&quot;. Some regions choose not to use this word at all, emphasizing the church&#x27;s separation from other mainstream beliefs.
: A gathering of members held in members&#x27; homes or rented buildings.
: A geographical region to which workers have been assigned (similar to &quot;parishes&quot;)
: A series of larger meetings known as gospel meetings, the function of which is proselytizing.
: Adherent or member of the laity. Collectively &quot;the friends&quot; or &quot;the saints&quot;.
: To make a public declaration of one&#x27;s willingness to become a member is generally a sign that a person may participate in the prayer and testimony sections of Wednesday night and Sunday morning meetings or at designated testimony times in larger gatherings. Professing constitutes an intermediate stage. Following baptism, the partaking of bread and grape juice (or wine) is also permitted, which occurs between the elder&#x27;s testimony and the final hymn in some fields.
: A chairman of a local meeting. Usually, the male head of the house in which meetings are held. The bishop/elder is typically the person in charge of calling the start of the meeting. The deacon is considered an alternative to the elder in some areas.
: Terms used to denote the church&#x27;s semi-itinerant, homeless ministers. These are unmarried (several exceptions were made during the first half of the 20th century to allow married couples to enter the ministry) and do not have any formal training. Workers go out in same-sex pairs (hence the term &quot;Two by Two&quot;), consisting of a more experienced worker with a junior companion.
: The senior worker in charge of a geographic area roughly corresponds to the position of a bishop in Catholicism. No hierarchical position is higher than overseer—such as a pope—which might guarantee doctrinal and practical unanimity.
: Any person who has not &#x27;professed&#x27; per the church&#x27;s processes and is therefore deemed to be &#x27;outside&#x27; of God&#x27;s fold
: A broad term used to describe all people not involved in the church, including those in other religions

== Practice and structure ==

=== Ministry ===
The church holds that faith and salvation may only be obtained by hearing the preaching of its ministers (typically called &quot;workers&quot;), and by observing their sacrificial lives. During the early years, this requirement was referred to as the &quot;Living Witness Doctrine&quot;, though that term is no longer used. The minister must be heard and observed in person, rather than by broadcasts, recordings, books or tracts, or other indirect communication. The church&#x27;s ministerial structure is based on Jesus&#x27; instructions to his apostles found in Matthew (with similar passages in and in ). The church&#x27;s view is that, following these Biblical examples, its ministers have no permanent dwelling places, minister in pairs, sell all and go out with only minimal worldly possessions, and rely only upon hospitality and generosity. Most ministers receive their support and income directly from lay members, and have no fixed address except for mail collection.

The option of entering the ministry is theoretically open to every baptized member, although it has been many decades since married people were accepted into the ministry. Female workers operate in the same manner as male workers. However, they cannot rise to the position of overseer, do not lead meetings when a male worker is present, and occupy a lower rank than male workers.

Workers do not engage in any formal religious training. Overseers pair new workers with senior companions until they are deemed ready to move beyond a junior position. The workers are assigned new companions annually. Workers organize and assign members to the home meetings, appoint elders, and decide controversies among members. Workers are not registered marriage celebrants, so members are married by secular functionaries (such as a justice of the peace). However, workers will give sermons and prayers at members&#x27; weddings if requested, and they officiate at the funerals of members.

=== Gatherings ===
The church holds several types of gatherings throughout the year in various locations.
: A Gospel meeting is the gathering that is most likely to be open to those considered to be &quot;outsiders&quot;. At one time, Gospel meetings were typically held in tents, set up by workers as they traveled; they are now most commonly held in a rented space. Gospel meetings are held to attract new members, though professing members typically make up the majority of attendees. The Gospel meeting consists of a period of quiet, followed by congregational singing (often accompanied by piano) of selected hymns, and then sermons delivered by the church&#x27;s workers. Gospel meetings are regularly scheduled for portions of the year in areas where the group is well-established. They may also be held when a worker believes there may be people in the region who would be receptive to the church&#x27;s message.
: Participation in this closed meeting is generally restricted to members. It is usually held in the home of an elder, and consists of a cappella singing from the regular hymnal, partaking of communion emblems (a piece of leavened bread and a cup of wine or grape juice), prayer and sharing of testimonies by members in good standing. Members are expected to be silent and arrive fifteen minutes early.
: Participation in this closed meeting is generally restricted to members, and is usually held in the home of an elder each Wednesday evening. Members are assigned a list of Bible verses or a topic of study for consideration during the week, for discussion at the next meeting. As the meeting progresses, each member shares thoughts regarding the scripture or topic. Thoughts are shared by individual members in turn, and members do not engage in discussions during the meeting. The Bible study meeting includes hymns and prayers.
: This is a monthly gathering of several congregations, and follows the format of the Sunday morning meetings. Union meetings are not open to the public.
: Special meetings are annual gatherings of members from a large area. Each is held as a private gathering, often in a rented hall. Special meetings last a single day, and include sermons by local and visiting workers. The sermons are interspersed with prayers, hymns, and testimonies.
: These annual events are attended by members from within a larger geographical area than for the special meetings. These services generally follow the format used for special meetings. Conventions are held over several days, usually in rural areas on properties with facilities to handle housing, feeding, and other necessities for those who attend. There are typically crude male and female dormitories, a dormitory for the Workers, and male and female communal bathrooms with simple showers. Conventions are not open to the public, although outsiders often attend by invitation. Although not now usual, members were at one time segregated by sex during services.
: These gatherings are not open to either the public or general membership. Attendance and participation are restricted to workers and certain invited members. The meeting may be a regular Bible study, or it may be used to disseminate any instructions from senior workers or to issue decisions about controversial matters. They are held during conventions, or as necessary. These meetings include prayer, a period for testimonies from any workers wishing to share, and may include statements by senior workers in attendance.

=== Organization ===
Members state that the church does not have a formal organization. Members do not participate in, and many are unaware of, the church&#x27;s governance. Although in the early years of the church a headquarters was maintained in Belfast, no official headquarters currently exist and the church remains largely unincorporated. Both expenditures and funds collected remain secret from the membership and no accounting is made public. Funds are handled through stewardships, trusts, and cash transactions.

No materials are published by the church for outside circulation other than invitations to open Gospel meetings. Printed materials are published for circulation among the members and include sermon notes, convention notes, Bible study lists, convention lists, and worker lists. In recent years, contact details of members, including phone numbers and home addresses, have been compiled into booklets. These booklets are treated as highly confidential and available for workers&#x27; use only. Some members of the group refuse to provide their details for these booklets, in the name of privacy. Some members of the group see the internal dissemination of worker letters as continuing the practice of the early Church and the epistolary work of the original apostles.

=== Hierarchy ===
The church is controlled by a small group of senior male overseers with each having oversight of a specific geographic region. Under each senior overseer are male head workers who have oversight of a single state, province or similar area, depending on the country. These head workers handle the two-by-two pairing and field assignments of workers for that area. Each pair of workers has charge over several local meetings with the senior worker of the two having authority over his junior. Local meetings are hosted in the homes of elders who report to the workers. Correspondence such as reporting, finances, and instructions are often communicated according to the set hierarchy. The administration of the church and its annual process of assigning of workers to fields are rarely discussed among the membership. Workers are believed to be holy conduits of God and are regarded highly by the congregation.

=== Hymnals ===
The church&#x27;s first hymnal, &quot;The Go-Preacher&#x27;s Hymn Book&quot;, was compiled by 1909 and contained 125 hymns. The English-language hymn book currently used is &quot;Hymns Old and New&quot; and was first published in 1913 with several subsequent editions and translations. It contains 412 hymns, many of which were written or adapted by workers and other members of the church, and is organized into &quot;gospel&quot; and &quot;fellowship&quot; hymns. A smaller, second hymnal, also titled &quot;Hymns Old and New&quot;, consists of the first 170 songs found in the full hymnal. Another version of the hymnal contains words without musical notation and is used primarily by children and those who cannot read music. Hymnals in other languages, such as &quot;Himnos&quot; in Spanish, contain many hymns translated from the English and sung to the same tunes, as well as original non-English compositions.

<doc id="1268236" wikidata="Q271877" url="?curid=1268236" title="Martha Hyer">
<text>Martha Hyer (August 10, 1924 – May 31, 2014) was an American actress who played Gwen French in &quot;Some Came Running&quot; (1958), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her autobiography, &quot;Finding My Way: A Hollywood Memoir&quot;, was published in 1990.

==Early and personal life==
Martha Hyer was born in Fort Worth, Texas, into a wealthy family, the daughter of Julien Capers Hyer, an attorney and judge, and Agnes Rebecca (née Barnhart). She was the middle of three sisters, with Agnes Ann and Jeanne. The Hyers were active in the Methodist church, where her father was a highly respected Sunday school teacher. Hyer graduated from Arlington Heights High School and then from Northwestern University with a degree in drama. She was in the sorority Pi Beta Phi with actress Patricia Neal. She then moved to California to study at the Pasadena Playhouse, and soon after was signed to a film contract with RKO. 

Hyer was married twice, first to producer C. Ray Stahl and later to producer Hal B. Wallis. She converted to Judaism, Wallis&#x27; religion, after their marriage. Wallis and Hyer remained together until his death in 1986. They contributed funds towards the construction of The Hal and Martha Hyer Wallis Theatre, a black box theater, at Northwestern University. She did not have any children.

==Film and television==
Hyer&#x27;s first film appearance was an uncredited speaking part in &quot;The Locket&quot; (1946). She appeared in uncredited and bit roles in B-movies for the next few years, occasionally working on television, as well. Eventually, she moved up the ranks, and starting in 1954, began receiving better roles, becoming a popular actress in Hollywood for the next decade.

Hyer had a supporting role in the drama &quot;So Big&quot; (1953), which stars Jane Wyman, and was directed by Robert Wise. She appeared as Janie in &quot;Abbott and Costello Go To Mars&quot; (also 1953). Hyer followed this with Westerns, &quot;Wyoming Renegades&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Battle of Rogue River&quot; (1954), and a musical comedy, &quot;Lucky Me&quot; (1954), which stars Doris Day. She then played Elizabeth Tyson, a socialite who almost loses her fiancé (William Holden) to Audrey Hepburn, in the Oscar-winning film &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954). She next starred opposite Donald O&#x27;Connor in the comedy &quot;Francis in the Navy&quot; (1955) and in a 1956 televised version of &quot;Jezebel&quot; for &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; in which she played the lead role of Julie.

She had supporting roles in the war story &quot;Battle Hymn&quot; (1957) with Rock Hudson and in the drama &quot;Mister Cory&quot; (1957) with Tony Curtis, directed by Blake Edwards. She was featured in &quot;Kelly and Me&quot;, a comedy with Van Johnson, and as Cornelia Bullock in the 1957 remake of &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; with David Niven. In 1958, Hyer appeared in a &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; televised version of &quot;Reunion&quot; by Merle Miller, along with Frances Farmer. She next appeared in &quot;Paris Holiday&quot; (1958) with Bob Hope and &quot;Houseboat&quot; (1958) with Cary Grant. Hyer was the foil for soon-to-be TV icons Dan Rowan and Dick Martin of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; fame in their &quot;Once Upon a Horse...&quot; (1958) Western film by Hal Kanter. For the 1958 drama &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, directed by Vincente Minnelli, Hyer was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Soon after, she had supporting roles in &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959) with Joan Crawford. Also in 1959 Martha played the role of Hannah Haley in &quot;Rawhide (TV series)&quot; S1 Ep 8 Incident West Of Lano.

Hyer started the 1960s with a supporting role in &quot;Ice Palace&quot; (1960), a drama with Richard Burton, and &quot;The Last Time I Saw Archie&quot; (1961), a comedy with Robert Mitchum. Next she was in &quot;A Girl Named Tamiko&quot; (1962), &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964).

By 1964, Hyer had turned 40 and after a decade of success, began having trouble finding good roles, and worked mainly in television and in European and American B-films. She did appear in two episodes of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, (&#x27;&quot;A Piece Of Action&quot; in 1962 and &quot;Crimson Witness&quot; in 1965). Also in 1965, she was in &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot;, a Western with John Wayne and Dean Martin. She guest-starred on the television series &quot;Bewitched&quot; as Margaret Marshall, a wealthy, seductive woman.

In 1966, she was in &quot;The Chase&quot;, directed by Arthur Penn and starring Marlon Brando and Robert Redford. On television, she guest-starred on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; in the episode &quot;The Richest Woman&quot;, in which she plays Tracy Richards, the world&#x27;s richest woman. In the late 1960s, she starred in the film drama &quot;Some May Live&quot;, the crime comedy &quot;The Happening&quot;, and the suspense film &quot;Crossplot&quot;. In 1967, she guest-starred on &quot;Family Affair&quot; in the episode &quot;Star Dust&quot;, in which she plays Carol Haven, a movie star.

Her final film role was in &quot;The Day of the Wolves&quot; (1971) and her final television role was in a 1974 episode of &quot;McCloud&quot;. At age 50, she retired from acting, although she later wrote the screenplay to the 1975 Western &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot;, starring John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn.

==Retirement and death==
Hyer enjoyed a quiet retirement through the 1980s and 1990s. She died on May 31, 2014, at the age of 89 from natural causes in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she had lived for many years.

<text>The 1999 Honolulu shootings or the Xerox murders were an incident of mass murder that occurred on November 2, 1999, in a Xerox Corporation building in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. Service technician Byran Koji Uyesugi shot at eight people, wounding seven fatally (six co-workers and his supervisor). This was the worst workplace shooting in the history of Hawaii.

==Shooting==
At 8:00 in the morning, Byran Koji Uyesugi, a service technician working at Xerox, opened fire inside the building with a semi-automatic pistol, killing his supervisor and six co-workers, and fired in the direction of another co-worker who fled the building. The eighth person escaped without injury. He fired 28 shots in total, 25 of which hit a person.

After the shooting, Uyesugi fled in a company van, and by mid-morning, he was found sitting in the van near the Hawaii Nature Center in Makiki, above downtown Honolulu. He held a standoff with police that lasted for five hours, during which he brandished a pistol, read magazines and smoked cigarettes. Adding to the tension of the standoff, the Hawaii Nature Center was hosting thirty-five local school children, who were trapped inside without food or water. Uyesugi surrendered to police at approximately 3:00 p.m. HST.

===Victims===
* Jason Balatico, 33
* Ford Kanehira, 41
* Ronald Kataoka, 50
* Ronald Kawamae, 54
* Melvin Lee, 58
* Peter Mark, 46
* John Sakamoto, 36

==Perpetrator==
Born in Honolulu in 1959, Byran Koji Uyesugi grew up in the Nuuanu neighborhood. While attending Roosevelt High School, Uyesugi was a member of the school&#x27;s Army JROTC chapter and the school&#x27;s rifle team. Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble. According to his brother Dennis, Uyesugi crashed their father&#x27;s car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in 1977; he was never the same afterwards.

Uyesugi had been employed by Xerox as a technician since 1984. Among his hobbies was raising and breeding goldfish and &quot;koi&quot;, which he would sell to local pet stores. He had an extensive collection of firearms. At the time of the murders he had as many as 25 guns registered in his name, dating to 1982. Police also took eleven handguns, five rifles and two shotguns from Uyesugi&#x27;s father.

According to testimony from Uyesugi&#x27;s father, Hiroyuki, Uyesugi was normal until he started working for Xerox in 1984. In 1988, Byran started to complain that he had a poking sensation in his head.

After being transferred to another workgroup, Uyesugi began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen. They had difficulty dealing with him. Former co-workers who knew him reported the other members of his team allegedly ostracized him, making him feel isolated and withdrawn. Uyesugi reportedly made threats against other co-workers&#x27; lives. In 1993, he was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation and anger management courses after he kicked in and damaged an elevator door. Uyesugi was arrested for third-degree criminal property damage. Co-workers told Dr. Michael Welner, chairman of the Forensic Panel and the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly talking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he to be fired. He complained that his co-workers were engaged in patterns of harassment, backstabbing behavior, and spreading of rumors.

In the period leading up to the shootings, Xerox management had become increasingly committed to phasing out the type of photocopier that Uyesugi serviced. He resisted learning the replacement machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi&#x27;s manager insisted on November 1, 1999, that he would begin training the next day. In his interview with Dr. Michael Welner, who examined Uyesugi when the defendant brought an insanity defense, Uyesugi said he had believed that if he refused to take the training, management would fire him. He told Dr. Welner, &quot;I decided to give them a reason to fire me.&quot;

==Trial==
Forty-year-old Byran Uyesugi&#x27;s month-long trial began on May 15, 2000. He was charged with one count of murder in the first degree (count 1), seven counts of murder in the second degree (counts 2–8), and one count of attempted murder in the second degree (count 9). Prior to the close of the trial, counts 2-8 were merged into count 1.

The Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu Peter Carlisle and Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys Christopher Van Marter and Kevin Takata represented the State of Hawaii. Criminal Defense Attorneys Jerel Fonseca and Rodney Ching of the law firm Fonseca &amp; Ching represented Uyesugi.

Uyesugi pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Uyesugi was, in his opinion, legitimately suffering the effects of schizophrenia, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination and his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that his actions were premeditated.

On June 13, 2000, the jury rejected the insanity defense, finding Uyesugi guilty on count 1 for the seven murders and count 9 for the attempted murder. On August 8, 2000, Judge Marie N. Milks sentenced Uyesugi to life without the possibility of parole for count 1 and life with the possibility of parole on count 9, with the sentences to run consecutively. The court also ordered Uyesugi to pay $500 in restitution and $70,000 to the crime victim compensation fund. Hawaii does not have the death penalty. The parole board later ordered Uyesugi to serve a minimum term of 235 years in prison, the longest ever ordered for a Hawaii inmate.
Uyesugi appealed his convictions. In 2002, the State of Hawaii Supreme Court upheld Uyesugi&#x27;s conviction. In 2004, Uyesugi was considering fighting his conviction based on Rule 40, inadequate representation by his lawyers in his first trial.

In 2005, Xerox and the hospital that examined Uyesugi settled a civil lawsuit brought by the families of the shooting victims. They believed that both parties had failed to take preventive action based on what they said were clear signs of Uyesugi&#x27;s mental instability.

 Uyesugi was incarcerated at the Saguaro Correctional Center in Eloy, Arizona.

==Aftermath==
Xerox vacated the premises at 1200 N. Nimitz Highway after the shooting. This facility was vacant until 2004, when the producers of the TV show &quot;Lost&quot; built a sound stage there to film indoor scenes. Dal-Tile currently leases the property from the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation for its tile and natural stone showroom.

The state legislature passed a law that requires doctors to reveal information about the mental state of persons applying to buy guns.

<text>Brazil is geopolitically divided into five regions (also called macroregions), by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, which are formed by the federative units of Brazil. Although officially recognized, the division is merely academic, considering geographic, social and economic factors, among others, and has no political effects other than orientating Federal-level government programs. Under the state level, they are further divided into intermediate regions and even further into immediate regions.

==The five regions==
===Central-West Region===


*Area: 1,612,007.2 km2 (18.86%)
*Population: 16,289,538 (7.2 people/km2; 6.4%)
*GDP: R$279 billion / US$174,3 billion (2008; 8.3%) 
*Climate: Savanna climate (hot, with little precipitation during winter in the northeast and the east; Tropical in the east and in the west; Equatorial in the north; Some temperate climate places in the south).
*States: Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal (Federal District).
*Largest Cities: Brasília (national capital) (2,562,963); Goiânia (1,318,148); Campo Grande (796,252); Cuiabá (556,298); Aparecida de Goiânia (442,978); Anápolis (334,613).
*Economy: Livestock, Soybeans, Maize, Sugarcane, Cotton, Tomato, Nickel, Copper, Gold, tourism.
*Transport: Highways where they are present (mostly in the center and east regions); transport by rivers is common in the north and in the east; airplanes are used in remote and smaller communities.
*Vegetation: Mainly savanna-like vegetation, including the Pantanal (Chaco, in Paraguay), flooded areas in the west, equatorial rainforests in the north.
*Notable characteristics: With a low population density, most of the land in the region is used for grazing instead of agriculture. The region is also the least industrialized in the country, based mainly in food &amp; meat processing.

===Southeast Region===


* Area: 927,286 km2 (10.85%)
* Population: 84,840,113 (77.96 people/km2, 38%)
* GDP: R$1,629 trillion / US$803 billion (2008; ~49%) 
* Climate: Tropical in the northwest (warm, relatively dry in the winter and wet in the summer); Semi-arid in the north; temperate in the south
* States: Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo
* Largest cities: São Paulo (11,037,593); Rio de Janeiro (6,186,710); Belo Horizonte (2,452,617); Guarulhos (1,299,283); Campinas (1,064,669); São Gonçalo (991,382); Duque de Caxias (872,762); Nova Iguaçu (865,089); São Bernardo do Campo (810,979); Osasco (718,646); Santo André (673,396); Uberlândia (634,345); Contagem (625,393); São José dos Campos (615,871); Sorocaba (584,313); Ribeirão Preto (563,107); Juiz de Fora (526,706); Belford Roxo (501,544); Niterói (479,384); São João de Meriti (469,827); Betim (441,748); Campos dos Goytacazes (434,008).
* Economy: Manufacturing (machinery, electronics, automobiles and aviation, steel, chemicals, shoes, textiles), coffee, sugar cane, orange juice, livestock, tourism, petroleum, iron, gold, energy production (not sufficient, however, to fulfill its demand). The Southeast is the economic center of Brazil, and most large companies present in Brazil have their headquarters in this region. The economic success of this region is a combination of its 4 states. São Paulo state is the most developed in the country, it has a population density as high as western Europe, and a HDI comparable to eastern Europe. Rio de Janeiro is the leader in petroleum production (with almost 3/4 of national production) . Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo are located in the richest mining region in Brazil.
* Transport: The region is heavily covered by highways, and, to some extent, railways. Railways and rivers are used mainly for freight, and used where they are present. The region also contains several airport hubs which provide many domestic and international air routes.
* Vegetation: Mainly tropical-like semi-deciduous forests (Mata Atlântica); semi-arid in the north, with almost no vegetation; savannah-like vegetation in the west and in the northwest (&quot;Cerrado&quot;). Very little of the native vegetation still remains (~2%, mostly in parks.)
* Notable characteristics: The southeast region is the major powerhouse of the Brazilian economy, responsible for 49% of the Brazilian GDP (approximately US$1024 billion in 2010). It is also the most populous region in the country, with more than 80 million people, and contains the three most important metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte), as well as many other large cities (such as, Vitória (the capital of Espírito Santo state), Campinas, Uberlândia and several others.)

===South Region===


*Area: 577,214 km2 (6.75%)
*Population: 29.937.706 (43.46 people/km2, 12.5%)
*GDP: R$503 billion / US$313,8 billion (2008; ~15%) 
*Climate: Subtropical by the coast, hot to moderately hot in the summer, mild and very humid winters and temperate by the mountain range, the valleys and the plateaus in the interior, with moderate temperatures in the summer and cold in the winter, with well distributed rainfalls. Snow is relatively common, mainly in the highlands (for example in Santa Catarina state&#x27;s São Joaquim).
*States: Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina
*Largest Cities: Curitiba (1,764,540); Porto Alegre (1,413,094); Joinville (520,905); Londrina (511,278); Caxias do Sul (441,332); Florianópolis (427,298); Maringá (362,329); Pelotas (328,864); Canoas (325,188); Ponta Grossa (314,527); Blumenau (312,634); Cascavel (289,339); Foz do Iguaçu (255,900); and Santa Maria (262,368).
*Economy: Machinery and automobile industries, textiles, shoes, information technologytourism, soy, maize, wheat, tobacco, rice, apple, wine,livestock, coal, energy production.
*Transport: There are many developed highways and railways throughout the region, although the latter is mainly used for freight. Rivers are used when possible.
*Vegetation: Rainforests along the coast (Mata Atlântica), subtropical semiciduous in the north and west (Araucárias) and prairie-like vegetation in the south (Pampas). Little native vegetation still remains due to deforestation.
*Notable characteristics: The South Region of Brazil is historically characterized by its high standard of living, with considerably better social indicators, which include some of the cities with the highest HDI levels in the country, including their capitals. Cities also feature an advanced level of urbanism in comparison with other parts of Brazil. The region is almost the newest in terms of urbanization, it was recently populated by European immigrants (almost 19th century immigration and refugees of World War I and World War IIs). They have added to the local culture, especially in architecture, cuisine and forms of agriculture. Southern region, however, is not immune from poverty, violence and other social issues, especially in the larger cities, even though in a lower level than poorer areas in the country. The state of Santa Catarina is proportionally the Whitest state in Brazil with over 87% of its population being European. The other southern states also have the highest percentage rates of European population.

===Northeast Region===


*Area: 1,561,177 km2 (18.3%)
*Population: 54,658,515 (30.55 people/km2; 29%; 2009)
*GDP: R$437 billion / US$273,1 billion (2009; ~12%) 
*Climate: Hot all year long. Tropical near the coast and semi-arid in the interior; semi-equatorial in the far west of the region.
*States: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Sergipe
*Largest cities: Salvador (2,676,606); Fortaleza (2,447,409); Recife (1,536,934); São Luís (1,011,943); Maceió (932,608); Natal (789,836); Teresina (714,583); João Pessoa (595,429); Jaboatão dos Guararapes; (580,795); Feira de Santana (481,137); Aracaju (461,083); Olinda (368,666); Campina Grande (354,546).
*Economy: Tourism, tropical fruits (coconut, papaya, melon, banana, mango, pineapple), cocoa, cashew nuts, soybeans, cotton, sugarcane, machinery manufacturing, textiles,wind energy production, salt extraction.
*Transport: Mainly highways, which are more abundant along the coast, although transport by sea is also important.
*Vegetation: Mainly desert-like vegetation, with tropical forests along the coast and in the west and savanna-like vegetation in the southwest.
*Notable characteristics: This region was the first part of Brazil discovered by the Portuguese, and the first Brazilian capital, Salvador, was founded here. It has the lowest levels in the country in almost all of the social indicators, being considered the most impoverished region in Brazil. However, it has been growing above national average since the start of the 21st century, gradually reducing the socio-economic distance to the other regions.

===North Region===

*Area: 3,689,637.9 km2 (45.27%)
*Population: 17,354,884 (4,5 people/km2; 6.2%; 2016)
*GDP: R$ 308 billion / US$94,8 billion (2016; 4.7%) 
*Climate: Equatorial
*States: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins
*Largest Cities: Manaus (2,063,689); Belém (1,303,403); Ananindeua (478,778); Porto Velho (460,434); Macapá (442,933); Boa Vista (413,486); Rio Branco (364,756); Santarém (331,937); Palmas (302,692).
*Economy: Iron, Copper, Gold, Bauxite, Manganese, Açaí, Pineapple, Energy production, electronic manufacturing, tourism.
*Transport: Mainly rivers (which are abundant in the region). Highways are scarce and present mainly in the east. Airplanes are commonly used in small remote communities and sometimes in the larger cities.
*Vegetation: Almost the entire region is covered by Amazon Rainforest, except the state of Tocantins, which has savanna-like vegetation (&quot;cerrado&quot;). Most of the native vegetation still remains.
*Notable characteristics: Presence of the Amazon Rainforest, which is the vegetation dominant in every state but Tocantins. Cities are spread far apart in the region, and it has the lowest population density of the country. There are very few paved highways in the region, as it is almost isolated from the rest of the country. It is also the biggest region of Brazil, being responsible for almost half of the Brazilian territorial extension. Economic growth is above national average (especially in Amazonas and in Tocantins).

== Ethnic composition of regions ==
The composition of regions of Brazil according to autosomal genetic studies focused on the Brazilian population (which has been found to be a complex melting pot of European, African and Native Americans components):

A 2011 autosomal DNA study, with nearly 1000 samples from all over the country (&quot;whites&quot;, &quot;pardos&quot; and &quot;blacks&quot;), found a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component. The study showed that Brazilians from different regions are more homogeneous than previously thought by some based on the census alone. &quot;Brazilian homogeneity is, therefore, a lot greater between Brazilian regions than within Brazilian regions.&quot;

According to an autosomal DNA study from 2010, a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific &quot;American Journal of Human Biology&quot; by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as colour of skin, eyes and hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies (regardless of census classification). Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.&quot;

An autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile &quot;all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico.&quot;

According to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%); the European ancestry being the dominant ancestry in all regions including the Northeast of Brazil.

A study from 1965, &quot;Methods of Analysis of a Hybrid Population&quot; (&quot;Human Biology&quot;, vol 37, number 1), led by geneticists D. F. Roberts and R. W. Hiorns, found out the average Northeastern Brazilian to be predominantly European in ancestry (65%), with minor but important African and Native American contributions (25% and 9%).

<doc id="1268252" wikidata="Q4956032" url="?curid=1268252" title="Brake run">
<text>A brake run on a roller coaster is any section of track that utilizes some form of brakes to slow or stop a roller coaster train. There are various types of braking methods employed on roller coasters, including friction brakes, skid brakes, and magnetic brakes. The most common is a fin brake, an alternative name for a friction brake, which involves a series of hydraulic-powered clamps that close and squeeze metal fins that are attached to the underside of a coaster train. Roller coasters may incorporate multiple brake runs throughout the coaster&#x27;s track layout to adjust the train&#x27;s speed at any given time.

The different types of brake runs are classified under two main categories: trim brakes and block brakes. A trim brake refers to a braking section that slows a train, while a block brake has the ability to stop a train completely in addition to slowing it down. Block brakes are important to roller coasters that operate more than one train simultaneously, in the event that one train stalls on a portion of the track. While modern roller coasters have at least one computer-controlled brake run embedded in the track, older coasters such as The Great Scenic Railway at Luna Park Melbourne may have brakes onboard the train and rely on a brakeman operator to apply them as needed.

==Brake classifications==
=== Trim brakes ===

Trim brakes are brake run sections that reduce the speed of the train but are not intended to stop the train completely. They may be engineered into a ride during design in anticipation of certain trouble spots, or later retrofitted in areas where trains are traveling at higher-than-expected speeds. Trim brakes can also be added for safety reasons, lowering the g-force riders experience at various points throughout the track layout, or for preventative maintenance reasons, reducing wear-and-tear on the trains or track. A proximity sensor often precedes the trim brake in order to identify the current speed of the passing train and determining how much the brake will need to slow the train, if at all.

=== Block brakes ===
Block brakes also have the ability to slow the train but serve the additional purpose of being able to stop the train completely. This is required on roller coasters that operate more than one train simultaneously on the track. They act as virtual barriers between the trains running on the roller coaster, preventing collisions should one train stop along the course for any reason. Block brake sections must also be engineered so that the train can begin moving again upon release, either by using a slight downward slope to let gravity take its course or by using drive tires to push the train out of the block. These are commonly called mid-course brake runs.

==Brake methods and types==

Roller coasters utilize a variety of braking methods that have evolved over time.

=== Skid brakes ===
Skid brakes involve a long piece of material, often ceramic-covered, that is situated in the middle of the track parallel to the rails. When the brake is engaged, the skid raises and causes friction against the underside of the train, reducing its speed. They can be used to slow or stop the train. Skid brakes were one of the first advancements in roller coaster braking and are typically found on older wooden coasters, such as Leap the Dips, the world&#x27;s oldest roller coaster still in operation.


=== Friction brakes ===
Friction brakes, commonly called fin brakes, involve a computer-controlled clamping system that squeeze metal fins attached underneath the train. Friction brakes can be used to slow or stop the train and are the most common form of brakes found on modern roller coasters. They can involve thick metal box beams or thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads.

Friction brakes are designed to be fail-safe, allowing them to engage even when there is a loss of power. They are also constructed with a certain measure of redundancy, incorporating extra sets of brakes in the event that one set fails. Opening is done by a bellows type of air-operated actuator, with each set of brakes fitted with its own air supply system that is controlled by supply valves that open and release the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring usually made of steel is used to hold the brake closed when engaged.

=== Magnetic brakes ===

Instead of relying on friction, which can often be affected by weather conditions such as rain, magnetic brakes apply resistance through magnetism without making direct contact with the train. They are made up of one or two rows of neodymium magnets. When a metal fin made of copper or a copper-aluminum alloy passes between the rows of magnets, eddy currents are generated in the fin, creating a magnetic force that opposes the fin&#x27;s motion. The resultant braking force is directly proportional to the speed at which the fin is moving through the brake element.

Magnetic brakes can be found in two configurations:
* The brake elements are mounted to the track or alongside the track and the fins are mounted to the underside or sides of the train. This configuration looks similar to friction brakes.
* The fins are mounted to the track and the brake elements are mounted to the underside of the train. This configuration can be found on Intamin Accelerator Coasters.

Magnetic brakes are silent and provide a smoother riding experience than friction brakes, gradually increasing the braking power so that the people on the ride do not experience rapid changes in deceleration. Intamin began incorporating them with their Accelerator Coaster models, as well as Bolliger &amp; Mabillard beginning in 2004 with their installation of Silver Bullet, the first inverted coaster to feature magnetic brakes. There are also third-party companies, such as Magnetar Technologies Corp., which provide a service to retrofit existing coasters with magnetic braking technology to increase safety, improve rider comfort, and lower maintenance costs and labor.
A disadvantage of magnetic braking is that the eddy force is not usually stable enough to hold a train completely still, and as such cannot be used as block brakes. Magnetic brakes are often complemented by an additional set of friction brakes or &quot;kicker wheels&quot;, rubber tires that make contact with the train and effectively park it. Another disadvantage is that they cannot be conventionally disengaged like other types of brakes. Instead, the fins or magnets must be retracted so that the fins no longer pass between the magnets. Accelerator Coasters, for example, have a series of magnetic brake fins located on the launch track. Prior to the train&#x27;s launch, the brakes are retracted out of the way to allow the train to reach its maximum speed. After launch, the brake fins are raised back in position to stop the train in the event of a rollback. An example of this can be found on Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure.

=== Brake Men ===
While skid brakes already existed by the time Scenic Railway had been conceived, LaMarcus Adna Thompson decided against using these brakes for his Scenic Railway roller coasters, and instead opted for using a brakeman system in a similar to manner to those used on gravity trains. The brakeman would sit in the center of the train and pull a lever to apply a brake and slow down the train. Over thirty Scenic Railways were constructed, but only a small number remain in operation.

<text>Cirilo Saucedo Nájera (born 5 January 1982 in Acámbaro, Guanajuato), known as Cirilo Saucedo, is a Mexican former professional goalkeeper who last played for Juárez.

==Club career==
Saucedo came to prominence playing for Club León of the Primera A in Mexico. After leading the team to a championship in the 2003 Clausura, Saucedo&#x27;s team lost to Dorados de Sinaloa in the playoff to determine which team was promoted to the Primera División. Nevertheless, Saucedo moved up, being contracted by the Dorados to reinforce their team.

In his first season in the first division, Saucedo started all 17 games for Sinaloa, allowing 32 goals. Following the 2006 Clausura season, Saucedo&#x27;s team Dorados was relegated to the Mexican First Division &quot;A&quot;. Rather than playing in the lower divisions of the lower leagues, Saucedo was snatched up by CD Veracruz prior to the Apertura 2006 season. A shoulder injury limited him to play in only 2 games for the &quot;Red Sharks&quot;.
In 2007, he was traded to UANL Tigres for Sebastián González. He spent 3 &quot;short&quot; tournaments there before the 2008 Apertura when the arrival of Oscar Pérez prompted Saucedo&#x27;s exit from the club.

Tigres loaned the goalkeeper to newly promoted Indios de Ciudad Juárez where he consolidated himself as a starter; he contributed to Indios&#x27; semi-final run of the Mexican championship, and more importantly staying at top flight of Mexican football.

With the conclusion of his loan, Saucedo returned to Tigres for the 2009 Apertura. Later he went to win the Superliga with UANL Tigres. After a tied game with Chicago Fire (1–1) and penalty kicks (4–3).

==Personal life==
His mother is a United States citizen and therefore, he had the option of playing for the United States.

<text>The eustatic sea level (from Greek εὖ &quot;eû&quot;, &quot;good&quot; and στάσις &quot;stásis&quot;, &quot;standing&quot;) is the distance from the center of the Earth to the sea surface. An increase of the eustatic sea level can be generated by decreasing glaciation, increasing spreading rates of the mid-ocean ridges or increasing the number of mid-oceanic ridges. Conversely, increasing glaciation, decreasing spreading rates or fewer mid-ocean ridges can lead to a fall in the eustatic sea level.

Changes in the eustatic sea level lead to changes in accommodation and therefore affect the deposition of sediments in marine environments.

==Overview==
The eustatic (global) sea level is the volume of Earth&#x27;s oceans. This is not a physical level but instead represents the sea level if all of the water in the oceans were contained in a single basin. Eustatic sea level is not relative to local surfaces, because relative sea level depends on many factors – including tectonics, continental rise and subsidence. Eustatic sea level follows the &quot;bathtub approach&quot; which describes the ocean as a single bathtub. One can add or remove water and Earth&#x27;s oceans will gain or lose water globally. Differences in eustatic sea level over time stem from three main factors: 

* Changes in total ocean water mass, for instance, by ice-sheet runoff. When an ice sheet (such as Greenland) begins to lose some of its ice mass due to melt, the liquid water is transported to the ocean. According to the &quot;bathtub approach&quot;, ice-sheet runoff from Greenland will affect eustatic sea level in all areas of the world, whether nearby or distant. Ocean water mass may shrink in size if the continental ice sheets grow in size, thereby removing liquid water from oceans and converting them to grow ice sheets 
* Changes in the size of the ocean basin, for instance, by tectonic seafloor spreading or by sedimentation. These slow processes can cause the total volume of the oceanic basin to change.
* Density changes of the water, for instance, by thermal expansion. Warming will cause water to experience greater molecular motion, thus increasing the volume a molecule will occupy. Expansion of water may also be caused by changes in ocean salinity. As continental ice accumulates, the ocean water freezes onto land but the salt it carried will mostly remain in the ocean. Thus, as ice sheets increase, ocean salinity also increases (and vice versa). An increase in salinity will increase the density of the ocean basin. Melting of ice sheets and a decrease of ocean salinity will effectively decrease the density of the water. These two effects together result in the sea level. The thermal part is called the thermosteric sea level, whereas the salinity part is called the halosteric sea level.

<doc id="1268268" wikidata="Q3233430" url="?curid=1268268" title="The Joys of Yiddish">
<text>The Joys of Yiddish is a book containing a lexicon of common words and phrases of Yinglish—i.e., words originating in the Yiddish language that had become known to speakers of American English due to the influence of American Ashkenazi Jews. It was originally published in 1968 and written by Leo Rosten.

The book distinguished itself by how it explained the meaning of the Yiddish words and phrases: almost every entry was illustrated by a joke. This made the book not only a useful reference, but also a treasured collection of Jewish humor.

As is inevitable with any book that references popular culture, it quickly became dated due to the dramatic changes that American culture (and Jewish-American culture) underwent over the next 30 years. Rosten published revised versions of the book with different titles: &quot;Hooray for Yiddish!&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Joys of Yinglish&quot; (1989). In 2003, a new edition of the original book was published. Titled &quot;The New Joys of Yiddish&quot;, it was revised by Lawrence Bush, with copious footnotes added to clarify passages that had become outdated. Some material was also rearranged.

==References in popular culture==

In 1998, Charles Schumer and Al D&#x27;Amato were running for the position of United States Senator representing New York. During the race, D&#x27;Amato referred to Schumer as a &quot;putzhead&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; referenced the entry for &quot;putz&quot; in &quot;The Joy of Yiddish&quot; and maintained that the phrase did not merely mean &quot;fool&quot;, as D&#x27;Amato insisted, but was significantly more pejorative: based on that entry, a better translation might be &quot;dickhead&quot;. D&#x27;Amato ended up losing the race; some observers credit this incident with costing him the election.

Harlan Ellison&#x27;s 1974 science fiction story &quot;I&#x27;m Looking for Kadak&quot; (collected in Ellison&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;Approaching Oblivion&quot; and in &quot;Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;) is narrated by an eleven-armed Jewish alien from the planet Zsouchmuhn with an extensive Yiddish vocabulary.

Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2005 fantasy film &quot;MirrorMask&quot; includes Rosten&#x27;s classic riddle, discussed in &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot; as follows:

The first riddle I ever heard, one familiar to almost every Jewish child, was propounded to me by my father:

&quot;What is it that hangs on the wall, is green, wet -- and whistles?&quot;
I knit my brow and thought and thought, and in final perplexity gave up.
&quot;A herring,&quot; said my father.
&quot;A herring,&quot; I echoed. &quot;A herring doesn&#x27;t hang on the wall!&quot;
&quot;So hang it there.&quot;
&quot;But a herring isn&#x27;t green!&quot; I protested.
&quot;Paint it.&quot;
&quot;But a herring isn&#x27;t wet.&quot;
&quot;If it&#x27;s just painted it&#x27;s still wet.&quot;
&quot;But -- &quot; I sputtered, summoning all my outrage, &quot;-- a herring doesn&#x27;t whistle!!&quot;
&quot;Right, &quot; smiled my father. &quot;I just put that in to make it hard.&quot;

John Updike&#x27;s final novel in the Rabbit series, &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot;, copies Rosten&#x27;s joke from the entry on &quot;tsuris&quot;.

== Translations ==
This book has a German translation published by Deutsche Taschenbuch Verlag, 11. 2002 and 4. 2003 : &quot;Jiddisch. Eine kleine Enzyklopädie&quot;, a French one published by Éditions Calmann-Lévy , &quot;Les Joies du Yiddish&quot; and a Czech one published by Academia in 1998, &quot;Jidiš pro radost&quot;, , republished by Leda in 2013, .

<doc id="1268283" wikidata="Q880774" url="?curid=1268283" title="Richard Riley">
<text>Richard Wilson Riley (born January 2, 1933) is an American politician, the United States Secretary of Education under President Bill Clinton and the 111th governor of South Carolina. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Riley is the only Democrat to serve two consecutive terms as governor in the time since the state constitution was amended to allow governors to serve consecutive terms.

==Early life and career==
Richard Riley was born on January 2, 1933, in Greenville, South Carolina, to Edward P. &quot;Ted&quot; Riley and the former Martha (née Dixon) Riley. He graduated cum laude from Furman University, where he was a member of the South Carolina Phi chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, in 1954 and received his law degree from the University of South Carolina.

Riley served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966. He served in the South Carolina Senate from 1967 to 1977.

== Governor of South Carolina, 1979–1987 ==

Riley was elected governor of South Carolina in 1978. During his first term, the state constitution was amended to allow governors to serve two terms. Riley was re-elected in 1982, 70%-30%, over the Republican former journalist W. D. Workman, Jr., of Greenville, and served until 1987.

As governor, Riley presided over the resumption of executions, despite his personal opposition to the death penalty.

Riley spearheaded the South Carolina Education Improvement Act of 1984, a consequential statewide education reform effort that led him to being dubbed as South Carolina’s “Education Governor.” He also initiated landmark legislation such as the Medically Indigent Assistance Act, the first statewide program of its kind in the nation; the Employment Revitalization Act aimed at coordinating occupational training statewide; and the Omnibus Crime Bill.

== Post-gubernatorial career ==

In 1993, President Bill Clinton approached Riley about an appointment to the United States Supreme Court, which Riley turned down. Clinton ultimately appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That same year, President Clinton appointed Riley to his Cabinet as Secretary of Education. From 1997 to 2000, Riley worked with senior adviser Carol Rasco, the director of Clinton&#x27;s childhood literacy initiative, the America Reads Challenge, to design and implement the program. Riley served as Secretary of Education until Clinton left office in 2001. Since then, he has served as a partner in the law firm of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, LLP, and served as a board member of the Albert Shanker Institute. On June 27, 2007, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and served as a campaign co-chair.

===World Justice Project===
Riley serves as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

== Recognition ==
In 1999, Furman University, Riley&#x27;s alma mater, created the Richard W. Riley Institute of Government, Politics and Public Leadership in his honor. In 2000, Riley received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in recognition of his support for education and especially for his repeated recommendations that all students learn a second language. In 2008, Walden University renamed its college of education the Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership, in honor of Riley&#x27;s &quot;commitment to students, his legacy of improving access to higher education, and his focus on diversity in education.&quot; Winthrop University also renamed its college of education after Riley in 2000.

&quot;TIME&quot; magazine in 2008 named him among the Top Ten Best Cabinet Members in USA history. The Christian Science Monitor once said that many Americans regard Dick Riley as &quot;one of the great statesmen of education in this (20th) century.&quot; The late David Broder, columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called him one of the &quot;most decent and honorable people in public life.&quot;

In 2018, his hometown of Greenville announced plans to memorialize him with a sculpture representing his extraordinary public leadership and commitment to quality education for all children.

The Richard W. Riley Collection opened in 2018 at the University of South Carolina’s South Carolina Political Collections and contains more than 3,000 photographs; thousands of speeches with Riley’s handwritten edits; extensive research notes on policy development; considerable correspondence and news clippings; interviews with Riley and his late wife, Tunky, their son, Ted, and Dick Riley&#x27;s father, Edward P. “Ted” Riley. The collection also includes printed campaign materials from Riley&#x27;s political campaigns and his efforts for others, including Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and Al Gore.

==Personal life==
Riley and his wife, the late Ann O. Yarborough, have three sons and one daughter.

<text>The Northrop Tacit Blue is a technology demonstrator aircraft created to demonstrate that a low-observable stealth surveillance aircraft with a low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR) and other sensors could operate close to the forward line of battle with a high degree of survivability.

==Development==
Unveiled by the U.S. Air Force on 30 April 1996, the &quot;Tacit Blue Technology Demonstration Program&quot; was designed to prove that such an aircraft could continuously monitor the ground situation deep behind the battlefield and provide targeting information in real time to a ground command center.

In December 1976, DARPA and the U.S. Air Force initiated the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX) program, which was part of a larger Air Force program called Pave Mover. The BSAX program&#x27;s goal was to develop an efficient stealth reconnaissance aircraft with a low probability of intercept radar and other sensors that could operate close to the forward line of battle with a high degree of survivability.

Tacit Blue represented the &quot;black&quot; component in the larger &quot;Assault Breaker&quot; program, which intended to validate the concept of massed standoff attacks on advancing armored formations using smart munitions. The Pave Mover radar demonstrators provided the non-stealth portion of the program&#x27;s targeting system, whereas Tacit Blue was intended to demonstrate a similar but stealth capability, while validating a number of innovative stealth technology advances.

The radar sensor technology developed for Tacit Blue evolved into the radar now being used by the E-8 Joint STARS aircraft.

Tacit Blue was given the cover designation of &quot;YF-117D&quot; by the Air Force.

==Design==
Tacit Blue, nicknamed &quot;the whale&quot; (and sometimes also called an &quot;alien school bus&quot; for its only slightly rounded-off rectangular shape), featured a straight tapered wing with a V-tail mounted on an oversized fuselage with a curved shape. It was the first stealth aircraft to feature curved surfaces for radar cross-section reduction. Northrop would use this stealth technology on the B-2 bomber. A single flush inlet on the top of the fuselage provided air to two medium-bypass turbofan engines. Tacit Blue employed a quadruply redundant digital fly-by-wire flight control system to help stabilize the aircraft about its longitudinal and directional axes.

==Operational history==
The aircraft made its first successful flight on February 5, 1982, in Area 51, at Groom Lake, Nevada, flown by Northrop test pilot Richard G. Thomas. The aircraft subsequently logged 135 flights over a three-year period. The aircraft often flew three to four flights weekly and several times flew more than once a day. 

Another Tacit Blue test pilot, Ken Dyson, told CNN in 2014 that Northrop had manufactured additional major components for the jet, which amounted to half of a second plane. &quot;If we lost one, we could have a second one up and flying in short order,&quot; Dyson said. 

After reaching about 250 flight hours, the aircraft was placed in storage in 1985. In 1996, after Tacit Blue was declassified, it was placed on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio and has been on display in the fourth hangar at the museum since June 2016.

<doc id="1268318" wikidata="Q982366" url="?curid=1268318" title="Renato Russo">
<text>Renato Russo (born Renato Manfredini, Jr., March 27, 1960 – October 11, 1996) was a Brazilian rock musician. He was the lead singer of the Brazilian pop rock band Legião Urbana. A Brazilian film depicting his life and career was released in 2013, called &quot;Somos Tão Jovens (We Are So Young)&quot;.

== Childhood ==
Renato Manfredini Jr. was born in Governador Island, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro. He started his studies at an early age, at Colégio Olavo Billac. During this period he wrote an essay titled &quot;Old house, in ruins&quot;. His father was an executive at Banco do Brasil, and the family moved to New York City in 1967, when he was assigned a job in the city. Renato and his family returned later to Rio de Janeiro and moved in with his uncle Sávio. At 18 years old, he came out as bisexual to his mother, and in 1988 he made it public by writing the song &quot;Meninos e Meninas&quot; (&quot;Boys n&#x27; Girls&quot;) with the chorus stating, in English, &quot;I like St. Paul, I like St. John, I like St. Francis and St. Sebastian, and I like boys and girls.&quot;

== Adolescence ==
In 1973, his family moved from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília, Distrito Federal, moving to the &quot;Asa Sul&quot; sector. In 1975, aged 15, Renato went through one of the hardest phases of his life when he was diagnosed as suffering from epiphysiolysis, a bone disease. He underwent surgery and had three platinum pins implanted in his pelvis. He suffered greatly throughout his convalescence, being confined to bed for 6 months, almost immobile. While he was under treatment, he did little more than listening to music, collecting an extensive and varied album collection. In an interview, Renato stated that this period was crucial in shaping his musical ear.

== Musical career ==
During the years of 1978 and 1979, he was the bass player of punk rock band Aborto Elétrico (&quot;Electric Abortion&quot;) which lasted 4 years, from 1978 to 1982, but broke up due to constant arguing between Fê Lemos, the drummer, and Renato. Although the band did not last long, during this period Renato Russo wrote many songs that would later become hits of Capital Inicial (founded by the remaining members of Aborto Elétrico) and Legião Urbana (founded by Renato Russo).

After the end of Aborto Elétrico, Renato began a solo career as the &quot;Trovador Solitário&quot; (Lonely Minstrel). This period only lasted a few months, as in 1982, he joined Marcelo Bonfá (the drummer of the band Dado e o Reino Animal), Eduardo Paraná (guitar player, known as Kadu Lambach) and Paulo Guimarães (keyboard player, known as Paulo Paulista) to form Legião Urbana. Renato was the lead vocal and bass player. Their main influences were the post punk bands of the time, especially Robert Smith from The Cure and Morrissey from The Smiths.

After the first few concerts, Eduardo Paraná and Paulo Paulista left the band. Dado Villa-Lobos then took over the guitars, creating the classic line-up of the band. The band also had Renato Rocha as a bass player from 1984 to 1989.

Leading Legião Urbana, Renato Russo reached the peak of his career as a musician, being recognized as the most important songwriter of Brazilian rock, securing a cult status within his fanbase.

He used to write long songs. The Dylan-esque &quot;Faroeste Caboclo&quot;, for instance, lasts 9:05, &quot;Clarisse&quot; is 10:33 long and &quot;Metal Contra as Nuvens&quot; is 11:29 minutes. The song &quot;Fátima&quot; was written in ten minutes. He recorded two solo albums, with both English and Italian songs, in the 1990s.

== Personal life ==
During his career he had four books published and, after his death, another four books were released about him, one of them being &quot;Conversações com Renato Russo&quot;, which contains excerpts from interviews showing his point of view on rock, bisexuality (including his own), the world, drugs and politics. He later told &quot;Folha de S. Paulo&quot;, in a 1980s interview, that he was pansexual, saying, &quot;I am part of a minority...in this country. I consider myself pansexual&quot;.

==Illness and death==
Renato Russo was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1989, although he did not talk about it publicly. He suffered greatly with the side effects of the antiviral medicines he had to take: &quot;When I take the cocktail, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m eating a dog alive. And the dog eats me from the inside&quot;&quot;.&quot; During a recording session in February 1996, he confided to friend and fellow singer Paulo Ricardo that he had stopped taking the medicines.

He died on October 11, 1996, at 1:15 a.m., weighing only 45 kilograms (99.2 pounds), due to complications caused by AIDS. He left a son, Giuliano Manfredini, at the time 7 years old. His body was cremated and the ashes were spread at the Parque Burle Marx in São Paulo – coincidentally, Legião Urbana&#x27;s ex-bassist Renato Rocha was hanging out with his girlfriend at the moment of the ashes&#x27; spreading and he got a flat tire right in front of the park.

On October 22, 1996, eleven days after his death, Dado and Bonfá announced the end of Legião Urbana. The band&#x27;s estimated sales in Brazil during Renato&#x27;s life amounted to roughly 25 million albums. More than a decade after his death, sales of his albums are still considerable.

<doc id="1268319" wikidata="Q1397740" url="?curid=1268319" title="Fireball Roberts">
<text>Edward Glenn &quot;Fireball&quot; Roberts Jr. (January 20, 1929July 2, 1964) was an American stock car racer.

==Background==
Roberts was born in Tavares, Florida, and raised in Apopka, Florida, where he was interested in both auto racing and baseball. He was a pitcher for the Zellwood Mud Hens, an American Legion baseball team, where he earned the nickname, &quot;Fireball&quot; because of his fastball. He enlisted with the United States Army Air Corps in 1945, but was discharged after basic training because of his asthma.

==Racing career==

He attended the University of Florida and raced on dirt tracks on weekends. In 1947, at the age of 18, he raced on the Daytona Beach Road Course at Daytona, for the first time. He won a 150-mile race at Daytona Beach the following year. Roberts also competed in local stock and modified races at Florida tracks such as Seminole Speedway.

&quot;Fireball&quot; Roberts continued to amass victories on the circuit, despite the changes in NASCAR, as it moved away from shorter dirt tracks to superspeedways in the 1950s and 1960s. In his 206 career NASCAR Grand National races, he won 33 times and had 32 poles. He finished in the top-five 45 percent of the time, and in the top-ten 59 percent of the time. He won both the Daytona 500 and Firecracker 250 events in 1962, driving a black and gold 1962 Pontiac built by car builder legend, Smokey Yunick. He also designed Augusta International Raceway, where he would last win.

Between 1962 and 1964, Roberts competed in multiple major sports car races, including a class win at the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans driving a Ferrari 250 GTO entered by North American Racing Team.

==Labor union==
In 1961, Roberts, temporary president of the Federation of Professional Athletes, was in dispute with NASCAR president, Bill France, over the Teamsters&#x27; Union affiliate – the FPA – which he and Curtis Turner had helped organize and which France was trying to disband. Unlike the banned Curtis Turner and Tim Flock, Roberts soon returned to the NASCAR fold.

==Death==
On May 24, 1964, at the World 600 in Charlotte, Roberts had qualified in 11th position and started in the middle of the pack. On lap seven, Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson collided and spun out and Roberts crashed trying to avoid them. Roberts&#x27; Ford slammed backward into the inside retaining wall, flipped over, and burst into flames. Witnesses at the track claimed they heard Roberts screaming, &quot;Ned, help me&quot;, from inside his burning car after the wreck. Jarrett rushed to save Roberts as his car was engulfed by the flames. Roberts suffered second-and third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body and was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition. Although it was thought that Roberts had an allergic reaction to flame-retardant chemicals, he was secretly an asthmatic, and the chemicals affected his breathing.

Roberts was able to survive for several weeks, and it appeared he might pull through, but he took a turn for the worse on June 30. He contracted pneumonia and sepsis and had slipped into a coma by the next day. Roberts died from his burns on July 2.

Roberts&#x27; death, as well as the deaths of Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald at the Indianapolis 500, six days after Roberts&#x27; crash, led to an increase in research on fire-retardant uniforms. It also led to the development of the Firestone RaceSafe fuel cell. Modern race cars use a foam-filled fuel cell to prevent fuel spillage of the magnitude of Roberts car. Also, fully fire-retardant coveralls would be phased in, leading to mandatory Nomex racing suits. Roberts had lost his close friend, Joe Weatherly, in January 1964 at the MotorTrend 500, at Riverside, California.

Many sources reported that Roberts was planning to retire since he had taken a public relations position at the Falstaff Brewing Company and that the race in which he was killed was to be one of the final races of his career.

==Legacy==
Despite having his career cut short and having never won a Grand National title, Roberts was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers. Other career accolades he won include induction into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1995. In 2000, the city of Concord, North Carolina, named a street near Charlotte Motor Speedway in his honor. 

After Roberts&#x27; death, NASCAR mandated that all drivers wear flame retardant coveralls while on track. They also instituted the five-point safety harness, and the special, contoured driver&#x27;s seat, as requirements for all NASCAR vehicles.

The &quot;Fireball Run&quot;, named for Roberts, was started in 2007. This streaming TV &quot;adventurally&quot; series, headquartered at Universal Studios in Florida, covers 40 teams as they compete in an 8-day, 2000 mile race and life-sized trivia game to raise money for missing and exploited children organizations. The Fireball Run is credited with assisting in the recovery of 38 missing children.

In 2013 Roberts was nominated for induction in the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he was included in the 2014 induction ceremony.

<doc id="1268326" wikidata="Q491937" url="?curid=1268326" title="Gungahlin">
<text>Gungahlin () is a district in the Australian Capital Territory, one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. The district is subdivided into suburbs, sections and blocks. &quot;Gungahlin&quot; is an Aboriginal word meaning either &quot;white man&#x27;s house&quot; or &quot;little rocky hill&quot;.

 Gungahlin comprised sixteen suburbs, including several under construction and a further suburb planned. The town of Gungahlin was part of the original 1957 plan for development in the ACT and in 1991 was officially launched as the fourth &#x27;town&#x27; by the ACT Chief Minister. At the time, the population of Gungahlin was just 389 residents. At the , the population of the district was 87,682.

Within the district is the northernmost town centre of the ACT, situated north of Canberra City (&quot;Civic&quot; in the local parlance); one of five satellite cities of the ACT, with Woden, Tuggeranong, Weston Creek and Belconnen.

==Establishment and governance==
The traditional custodians of the district are the indigenous people of the Ngunnawal tribe.

Following the transfer of land from the Government of New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government in 1911, the district was established in 1966 by the Commonwealth via the gazettal of the &quot;Districts Ordinance 1966&quot; (Cth) which, after the enactment of the &quot;Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act&quot; 1988, became the &quot;Districts Act&quot; 1966. This Act was subsequently repealed by the ACT Government and the district is now administered subject to the &quot;Districts Act&quot; 2002.

During colonial times and up until the late 1960s, present-day Gungahlin was part of the former farmlands of Ginninderra. Ginninderra Village and later still the village of serviced the needs of the local farming community. Free settlers included farming families such as the Rolfe, Shumack, Gillespie and Gribble families. These settlers established wheat and sheep properties such as &#x27;Weetangara&#x27;, &#x27;Gold Creek&#x27;, &#x27;The Valley&#x27;, &#x27;Horse Park&#x27; and &#x27;Tea Gardens&#x27;. Much of the local produce supplied the large workforce at goldfields at Braidwood and Major&#x27;s Creek in New South Wales.

==Location and urban structure==
Gungahlin is the first district encountered when travelling to Canberra from Melbourne or Sydney via the Barton Highway.

The district is a set of contiguous residential and industrial suburbs that surround a town centre, together with undeveloped pastoral leases that border with the state of New South Wales to the north, north-east and east. The main industrial suburb of the district is .

The district is separated by open country from the adjacent districts of Belconnen to the west and south-west, Canberra Central to the south, Majura to the south-east, and the town of Hall to the north-west.

==Demographics==
At the , there were 87,682 people in the Gungahlin district, of these 49.8 percent were male and 50.2 percent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.6 percent of the population, which was lower than the national and territory averages. The median age of people in the Gungahlin district was 32 years, which was significantly lower than the national median of 38 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 23.0 percent of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 7.2 percent of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 54.0 percent were married and 8.9 percent were either divorced or separated.

Population growth in the Gungahlin district was 35.6 percent between the 2001 census and the 2006 census, another 50.0 percent to 2011, 50.4 percent to 2016 and another 23.2 percent to 2021. Population growth in Gungahlin district was significantly higher than the national population growth for the same periods, which amounted to 5.8%, 8.3%, 8.8% and 8.6% respectively. The median weekly income for residents within the Gungahlin district in 2021 was 48.6 percent above the national average, but slightly lower than the territory average.

In 2021, compared to the national average, households in the Gungahlin district had a significantly higher than average proportion (41.3 percent) where a non-English language was used (national average was 24.8 percent); and a significantly lower proportion (58.0 per cent) where English only was spoken at home (national average was 72.0 percent).

==Transport==

The primary mode of transport within the district is the private car. Despite continued discussion about the need for sustainable public transport, especially light rail, Gungahlin&#x27;s development is still based on a reliance on private personal transport and an extensive road network.

===Public transport===
====Bus====
The ACTION bus service provides public transport throughout Canberra. Services from the suburbs and other town centres connect with the interchange at Gungahlin Place in the town centre. Nearby is the terminus for the light rail service which runs direct to Civic.

====Light rail====

A light rail network linking the Gungahlin Town Centre to Civic opened in April 2019. It was intended to lessen peak-hour congestion on Northbourne Avenue by encouraging public transport use. The terminus is located on Hibberson Street near the bus interchange.

===Private transport===
Private transport is the dominant mode of transport for Gungahlin residents. The major arterial roads to North Canberra and the city centre are Northbourne Avenue via the Barton Highway, Horse Park Drive and Flemington Road. Gundaroo Drive is the main connection to the district of Belconnen. With the completion of the Gungahlin Drive Extension in 2008, Gungahlin motorists can bypass the city centre to reach city&#x27;s southern suburbs via Gungahlin Drive and onto William Hovell Drive and the Tuggeranong Parkway.

A number of projects have improved road access to the Gungahlin district, including:
* Duplication of the remaining single lane sections of the Gungahlin Drive Extension (completed 2011).
* Clarrie Hermes Drive extension to the Barton Highway (completed May 2012).
* Flemington Road was upgraded to a dual carriage way between Gungahlin Town Centre and Well Station Drive in 2010. As part of the light rail construction project, the remaining section from Well Station Drive to the Federal Highway was also duplicated, completed in 2019.

==Public facilities==
While the Gungahlin district is serviced by Calvary Hospital and The Canberra Hospital for emergency treatment, a number of private medical practices have established in the town centre and surrounding suburbs. The ACT Government Health Directorate also operates a Community Health Centre, providing access to allied health and outpatient services including mental health services, children&#x27;s dental and nutrition, diabetes clinic, pathology collection and drug and alcohol counseling services. The clinic opened on 3 September 2012.

The Australian Capital Territory Emergency Services Agency operates the Gungahlin Joint Emergency Services Centre which provides the Gungahlin district with a local operations centre for Ambulance and Police as well as ACT Fire and Rescue and the Rural Fire Service.

==Community and sports organisations==
The Gungahlin Community Council is the peak community representative organisation for the district.

Gungahlin local sport teams include the Gungahlin Eagles (rugby union), the Gungahlin Bulls (rugby league), Gungahlin United (association football) and the Gungahlin Jets (Australian rules football). All four clubs play matches at Gungahlin Enclosed Oval. Gungahlin is also represented in the ACT Cricket Association by the North Canberra Gungahlin Cricket Club.

<doc id="1268328" wikidata="Q281339" url="?curid=1268328" title="Henninger Turm">
<text>Henninger Turm (Henninger Tower) was a grain storage silo located in the Sachsenhausen-Süd district of Frankfurt, Germany. It was built by Henninger Brewery (now part of the Binding Brewery/Radeberger Group) and had a storage capacity of 16,000 tons of barley. The , 33-storey, reinforced concrete tower was designed by Karl Lieser and was built from 1959 to 1961. It was inaugurated on 18 May 1961. It was demolished in 2013. Until 1974 it was the tallest building in Frankfurt, and it remained the tallest storage silo in the world until its demolition.

On top of the building was a barrel-like pod which contained a viewing platform and a revolving restaurant (originally two). In October 2002, the tower was closed to the public. From 1961 to 2008, the annual professional cycling race &quot;Rund um den Henninger-Turm&quot; was held on 1 May, the course circling the tower multiple times.

== Neuer Henninger Turm ==
In November 2012, it was announced that Henninger Turm would be demolished because it was too costly and uneconomic for renovation. Demolition began in January 2013 and was completed by the end of the year. On its site a new residential tower was built. Being inspired by the former Henninger Turm, the design was conceived by the architects Meixner Schlüter Wendt. Whereas both the contours and the side facing the city are strongly reminiscent of the original appearance of the old silo, the three other sides clearly indicate the new building&#x27;s function as a residential tower. It contains 209 luxury apartments. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and the tower was completed in summer 2017.

<doc id="1268346" wikidata="Q608704" url="?curid=1268346" title="Supertramp (album)">
<text>Supertramp is the debut album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in August 1970. The first UK press was released under the title &quot;And I&#x27;m Not Like Other&quot;, but this title was printed on the labels only. In some countries it was released under the titles Surely (Singapore), and Now and Then (Spain).

It was not released in the United States until late 1977, but available through importers and was usually carried in record stores that specialised in British imports. The 1977 issue reached No. 158 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background and recording==
All the album&#x27;s lyrics were written by Richard Palmer, since none of the other members of Supertramp were willing to write any. Palmer himself later said that he considered writing lyrics &quot;like having to do school work&quot; at the time. The music to the songs were all composed jointly by Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson.

The album was recorded entirely at Morgan Studios in night sessions running from 12 am to 6 am, due to a superstition on the part of the band members (fuelled by their having heard that Traffic and Spooky Tooth recorded at late hours) that there was some &quot;magic&quot; to recording at night. Hodgson later recalled &quot;Invariably our engineer, Robin Black, would fall asleep on us in the middle of the sessions, which were pretty intense as it was, because we fought a lot with Richard Palmer.&quot; He was fond of the resulting album, however, and commented over a decade later that &quot;It was very naïve, but it has a good mood to it.&quot;

To promote the album, the band played at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, held a few weeks after release.

As the songs for Supertramp&#x27;s third album, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (1974), were introduced into the band&#x27;s live set, the songs from &quot;Supertramp&quot; were mostly dropped, never to return. The two exceptions are &quot;Home Again&quot; and &quot;Surely&quot;, which were occasionally played during encores for several years after. &quot;Surely&quot; has also been included on some of the band&#x27;s compilation CDs.

Songs from this album, including &quot;Words Unspoken&quot; and &quot;I Am Not Like Other Birds of Prey&quot;, were used as part of the soundtrack for the UK film &quot;Extremes&quot; (1971), along with music from other groups.

==Reception==
The critical response to the album was generally positive, with a review by Judith Simons in &quot;Daily Express&quot; commenting: &quot;This debut record album by a group of promising musician-poets is rather more melodic than most discs which pass under the label &#x27;progressive pop.&#x27;&quot; Despite this, the album was a commercial flop.

Retrospective reviews are more negative. In their review, AllMusic said the album was &quot;inundated with pretentious instrumental meandering, with greater emphasis and attention granted to the keyboards and guitars than to the writing and to the overall effluence of the music.&quot; However, they admitted that the album&#x27;s &quot;mixture of ardour and subtlety&quot; is appealing.

<text>The Fernmeldeturm Mannheim is a concrete telecommunication tower with an observation deck in Mannheim, Germany. It was designed by the architects Heinle, Wischer und Partner and built from 1973 and 1975. It contains transmission facilities for VHF radio services, microwave communications, and omnidirectional radio services. A glassed observation deck and a revolving restaurant at a height of 120 metres allow a nice view over Mannheim and the surrounding area. The tower is a modern landmark of the city of Mannheim.

In December 1994 a German SAR Army helicopter returning from a medical patient transfer mission collided with the top of the tower and fell to the ground. The crew of four people died instantly. Parts of the top of the tower were disconnected and also fell to the ground.

<doc id="1268362" wikidata="Q241670" url="?curid=1268362" title="Bangladesh national football team">
<text>The Bangladesh national football team () is the national recognised football team of Bangladesh and is controlled by the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF). It is a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) since 1973 and of FIFA since 1976, even though the Bangladesh Football Federation was first founded in 1972. Bangladesh was elected as a member of the AFC Executive Committee in 1982–1986 and 1998–2002. The current Executive Committee was elected democratically, under an AFC approved constitution and direct supervision of FIFA &amp; AFC, in October 2024.

Bangladesh&#x27;s national team debuted in 1973 and has yet to qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals. They were dismissed in the first round of their only Asian Cup appearance to date in 1980; by qualifying for it, Bangladesh is one of only two South Asian nations to achieve the feat. The nation&#x27;s best results came at South Asian level where it won the 2003 SAFF Gold Cup and were gold medalists at the 1999 South Asian Games. Bangladesh was one of Asia&#x27;s emerging teams in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, since the turn of the century, top-level football in Bangladesh is played somewhere in the shadow of the country&#x27;s national cricket team. This is mostly due to inadequate budget allocation and lack of technical skills adaptation. To date, football remains a popular sport in Bangladesh but cricket remains the most popular sport in the nation.

==History==
===Origins (1895–1972)===

In 1895, the Dacca Sporting Association, or the DSA, was formed in a small tin house at Paltan Maidan in Dhaka. Eventually, during the early 1930s, numerous tournaments were being held in East Bengal, and it was observed that Bengalis there were improving in football. In those days, Islington Corinthians from England toured all around the world and introduced their football to every country they visited. On 21 November 1937, the team visited Dhaka, where they took on the DSA XI. The Bengalis of Dhaka handed Corinthians their tour&#x27;s first defeat, recording a 1–0 victory during their maiden encounter. The majority of the DSA XI players were students of Dhaka University. Thousands of people were overjoyed to see the English lose on the field that day. While leaving, the opposition admitted to their defeat by stating, &quot;I heard a lot about the Bengal tiger! This time I saw it!&quot;

The first instance of a Bangladesh national football team was the emergence of the Shadhin Bangla football team during the 1971 Liberation War. They toured throughout India and helped fund the provisional Bangladesh government, by handing over all the prize money they earned from playing exhibition games during their tour. After gaining independence from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, a &quot;de facto&quot; national team called Dhaka XI was active the following year. The team won a highly anticipated friendly against Mohun Bagan on home soil and also finished runners-up at India&#x27;s Bordoloi Trophy.

===Emergence (1973–1984)===
The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) was founded on 15 July 1972 by Md.Yousuf Ali, the country&#x27;s former Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs. BFF became affiliated with AFC in 1973 and FIFA in 1976. Former Dhaka XI head coach Sheikh Shaheb Ali was put incharge of the first national team and Zakaria Pintoo who lead the Shadhin Bangla Team before liberation, was made its captain. In July 1973, Malaysia invited Bangladesh to take part in the Merdeka Cup, along with Pintoo the first national team consisted of: Shahidur Rahman Shantoo, Abdul Motaleb, Monwar Hossain Nannu, Dilip Barua, Nazir Ahmed, Firoj Kabir, Farukuzzaman, Abdul Hakim, Sharifuzzaman, Md Kaikobad, Enayetur Rahman, Kazi Salahuddin, Pratap Shankar Hazra, Sheikh Ashraf Ali, Sunil Krishna and Nowsher.

On 27 July 1973, the Bangladesh football team played its first official game, a 2–2 draw against Thailand in the Merdeka Cup. Enayetur Rahman scored the country&#x27;s first ever international goal and the second goal was scored by fellow striker Kazi Salahuddin. After the stalemate, the game went to penalties, where Bangladesh lost 5–6. On 13 August 1973, after concluding their journey in Malaysia the team played a friendly in Singapore, and earned their first ever win by defeating the hosts 1–0, thanks to a goal from Nowsher. In August 1975, Bangladesh were again invited to partake in the Merdeka Cup held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. During their underwhelming tournament, the players were informed about the &quot;Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&quot;, and decided to abandon the tournament to return home amidst the political unrest. However, fearing a FIFA ban the team was obliged to play their game with South Korea, making a symbolic protest by keeping the Bangladesh flag at half-mast and wearing a black badge, as they lost 0–4.

Aside from competing in the 1976 King&#x27;s Cup, Bangladesh remained inactive until 1978, when Werner Bickelhaupt was appointed as the country&#x27;s first foreign coach. The team experienced internal conflict going into the 1978 Asian games in Bangkok, as the captaincy was stripped off the senior most player Monwar Hossain Nannu of Abahani and handed over to Shahidur Rahman Shantoo from Mohammedan SC, seven players from Abahani including Nannu quit the team in protest. The much depleted Bangladesh team struggled in the tournament losing to both Malaysia and India. Following this incident, the federation attempted to pick captains outside the two &quot;Dhaka giants&quot; for the next few years. In March 1979, the 1980 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers began on home soil and surprisingly considering that this was their first time taking part in a qualifying tournament, Bangladesh guided by local trainer Anwar Hossain, opened their campaign with draws against Afghanistan and Qatar. The team then went on to claim only their second ever victory by defeating the Afghans 3–2, which was eventually enough for them to qualify for the main event.

The 1980 AFC Asian Cup was held in September in Kuwait, and Bangladesh were grouped with defending champions Iran as well as North Korea, Syria and China. The team now coached by Abdur Rahim, opened the tournament respectably with a narrow 3–2 defeat against North Korea. Their goals came from Kazi Salahuddin and Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu. They also held on well against Syria, losing 0–1. However, the next couple of games saw Bangladesh being embarrassed 7–0 and 6–0 respectively, by Iran and China, finishing the tournament bottom of their table. Bangladesh continued their continental exploits, as a goal from Badal Roy against Malaysia at the 1982 Asian Games, gave the team their first ever win in Asia&#x27;s biggest stage at the time. Despite all their early success, the team would see a slump in form, failing to qualify for the 1984 AFC Asian Cup and also endured a painful defeat to Nepal in the 1984 South Asian Games final.

===Rise and Fall (1985–2002)===

In 1985, Bangladesh took part in the 1986 World Cup qualifiers, and were grouped along with India, Indonesia and Thailand. The country&#x27;s first ever win at the qualifiers came against Indonesia. The game was held at the Bangladesh Army Stadium, and the under-pressure home team had overturned a single goal deficit through Kaiser Hamid and Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu. They followed up the Indonesia result by edging past Thailand 1–0 in the next game. Nonetheless, the team finished bottom of the group, behind Thailand on goal difference. In the wake of their first World Cup qualifying campaign, Bangladesh took part in the 1985 South Asian Games as one of the favorites. The team cruised through the group-stages, claiming their biggest ever win in an 8–0 thrashing of Maldives along the way, but luck was not on their side, losing to India on penalties in the final. During the 1990 World Cup qualifiers, the team only registered a single victory, which came in a 3–1 thrashing of Thailand. Despite the solitary victory, Bangladesh fought toe-to-toe with Asian giants Iran and China during both legs.


Iranian legend Nasser Hejazi took charge of Bangladesh at the 1989 South Asian Games, and dropped experienced players (Sheikh Aslam, Wasim Iqbal and Md Mohsin) from the squad. After an error-prone team lost the final to Pakistan, the Mohammedan coach Hejazi was accused of having a bias against selecting players from rival club, Abahani. In 1995, following a series of managerial changes, Otto Pfister was appointed as coach. On 4 November 1995, with Pfister handing the team&#x27;s captaincy to Monem Munna, Bangladesh won the 4-nation Tiger Trophy in Myanmar, which was the nation&#x27;s very first major trophy. The year 1996 saw Bangladesh being ranked 110 by FIFA, however, they failed to add to their success, finishing runner-up at the 1995 South Asian Games and 1999 SAFF Gold Cup. It was at the 1999 South Asian Games where the Bangladesh team coached by Samir Shaker ended their 19-year wait for a gold medal, defeating hosts Nepal in the final.

On 12 January 2001, a historic moment occurred for the Bangladesh team, as they played their first match against a European nation, when they took on Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina during the Sahara Cup and lost 2–0. On 18 March 2001, Firoj Mahmud Titu became the first Bangladeshi player to score against European opposition, as Bangladesh suffered a 4–1 defeat at the hands of FR Yugoslavia during the same competition. The team proceeded to grow more and more despondent, suffering elimination from the first Round of 2002 World Cup qualifiers with only 1 win from 4 games. On 11 January 2002, FIFA imposed a ban on Bangladesh, due to the government violating the FIFA and AFC law that only recognizes a democratically elected committee to run a country&#x27;s football federation. Nonetheless, the ban was short lived, after the government reinstated the elected committee of Bangladesh Football Federation, FIFA lifted the ban, on 11 February.

=== SAFF Gold Cup triumph (2003) ===
After failing to produce satisfactory results in the previous two years, coach György Kottán remained incharge of Bangladesh during the 2003 SAFF Championship which took place in Dhaka, between 10 January 2003 and 20 January 2003. Hosts Bangladesh started off the tournament by winning their opening game against Nepal (1–0), with Alfaz Ahmed scoring the only goal, 30 minutes into the match. In the following game, the team again won by a solitary goal, thanks to a late strike from Arif Khan Joy against Maldives. Bangladesh topped their group after winning the last game 3–0 against Bhutan, with goals coming from Farhad and Kanchan. In the semifinals they faced India, who were the defending champions after defeating Bangladesh in the final in 1999. Bangladesh avenged their defeat from four years earlier by overcoming India 2–1, owing to a Golden goal by Motiur Munna and thus progressing to their second consecutive SAFF Championship final. However, before the final the Bangladesh team dealt a huge blow, as their captain Rajani Kanta Barman who played in every game during the tournament until then, picked up a suspension, denying him a chance to play in the next match. In the final Bangladesh again faced Maldives, Hassan Al-Mamun replaced Rajani in defense and took up the captain&#x27;s armband before the game. Rokonuzzaman Kanchan gave the hosts the early lead and Bangladesh spent the rest of the first half dominating possession. During the second half a defensive blunder by Bangladesh lead to Ali Umar scoring the equalizer. The game remained tied at 1–1 after 90 minutes and even after another 30 minutes of extra time the two sides could not be separated. In the penalty shootout, goalkeeper Aminul Haque saved the second penalty from Maldives and at last Mohammed Sujan held his nerves and scored the winning penalty, as Bangladesh secured their first SAFF Championship in front of 46,000 supporters present at the National Stadium.

===Inconsistency (2003–2010)===

The 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, began from March 2003. It was another devastating qualifying campaign for Bangladesh, a defeat at the hands of Laos and a draw against Hong Kong, concluded their Asian Cup qualification hopes. The team did show signs of improvement by reaching the final of the 2005 Saff Championship, only to be defeated by India in the final again. From December 2005, Bangladesh began their 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification campaign, winning only a single game in the process, before once again failing to reach the main phase of the competition. The 2008 SAFF Championship also ended in huge disappointment, as Bangladesh were knocked out during the group-stages, even after the BFF launched the country&#x27;s first professional league, the Bangladesh Premier League, the previous year. Their underwhelming SAFF campaign resulted in the dismissal of coach of Abu Yusuf. He was replaced by another former national team player, Shafiqul Islam Manik, who only lasted at the job for three months.

On 24 January 2009, Bangladesh appointed Brazilian coach Dido. Under his guidance the team saw an upturn in results, winning two of the three 2010 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers and advanced into the main tournament. However, he was sacked within 11 months as he refused to select established national team players. During his last interview before leaving Bangladesh, Dido criticized the country&#x27;s footballing structure and stated that it was corrupt. This again raised questions about BFF president Kazi Salahuddin&#x27;s management of the country&#x27;s football. The 2009 SAFF Championship saw Bangladesh once again hosting the tournament. Former national team keeper Shahidur Rahman Shantoo was appointed as the interim coach just a few days before the tournament. His time at the job was also short lived, as the hosts were knocked out in the semi-final by eventual champions India. The deterioration in results over the following decade and more saw a massive decline in popularity of the country&#x27;s football among fans, in both domestic and international stage.

===Decline (2011–present)===

On 29 June 2011, after a goalless away leg, Bangladesh beat Pakistan 3–0 on aggregate in Dhaka during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers–first round. The game took place only four days after Nikola Ilievski was appointed as the team&#x27;s head coach. This allowed Bangladesh to advance to the second round to face Lebanon. The first game was played in Beirut on 23 July 2011, where the hosts won 4–0. The return game in Dhaka saw Bangladesh being eliminated, even though they managed to salvage a 2–0 victory against the Middle Eastern giants. However, the dearth of quality players was evident as the nation failed to win a single game during the entirety of the 2011 SAFF Championship.

In January 2013, Lodewijk de Kruif took charge of the team, and under his leadership, they even failed to advance from the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers, a tournament held to assist lower-ranked teams. Bangladesh played their first four games of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Australia and Jordan, losing all of the matches apart from their home game against Tajikistan, where they drew 1–1. These results led to De Kruif being sacked in September 2015. In March 2016, Bangladesh ended their 2018 World Cup Qualifying run with an 8–0 defeat at the hands of a Jordan team managed by Harry Redknapp.

On 29 June 2016, the BFF appointed Belgian coach Tom Saintfiet, initially on a short-term contract, to guide the national team during the AFC Asian Cup 2019 qualification playoff round 2 matches against Bhutan. Saintfiet called up the veteran striking pair of Jahid Hasan Ameli and Enamul Haque for the encounter, but to no avail. Following a 0–0 draw in the first leg in Dhaka, Bhutan inflicted a 3–1 defeat on Bangladesh at the Changlimithang Stadium in Thimphu during the second leg. The results meant Bangladesh would not be a part of any AFC and FIFA tournaments for the following two years, until the launching of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2023 Asian Cup qualifiers. By February 2018, Bangladesh had plummeted to 197 in the FIFA World Rankings, marking the country&#x27;s lowest ranking to date.

In May 2018, Jamie Day took charge of the team. Although the team disappointed during the 2018 SAFF Championship, Bangladesh advanced to the 2022 World Cup qualifiers – AFC second round by defeating Laos 1–0 on aggregate. They were grouped together with neighbors India and Afghanistan, alongside Asian powerhouses Qatar and Oman. The team managed to earn well-deserved draws against India and Afghanistan, and although they suffered some heavy defeats in the following games, Bangladesh reached the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers as one of the three best fifth-positioned teams. In September 2021, after five consecutive defeats, Day was put on a two-month leave just before the 2021 SAFF Championship got underway. However, interim coach Óscar Bruzón was not able to change the country&#x27;s fate, as Bangladesh yet again underwhelmed at the tournament.

On 8 January 2022, the BFF appointed Javier Cabrera as the permanent head coach of Bangladesh on an 11-month contract. Under Cabrera Bangladesh crashed out of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification – third round, failing to secure a single victory.

===Media coverage===
Bangladesh&#x27;s home and away qualifiers and friendlies are broadcast live on Bangladesh Television, Bangla TV &amp; T Sports (Bangladesh).

===Kits===

The Bangladesh national football team plays in bottle green shirts and dark red shorts embedded. Also with red and green stripes. Green and red are the historic national colors of Bangladesh, originating from its the national flag. The red represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the country&#x27;s independence, while the green represents the lushness of its land. The usual Bangladesh away jersey is completely diametric to the regular one, and similar to most national teams Bangladesh uses the country&#x27;s footballing federation as a logo on the kit.

In 2010, BFF announced Grameenphone as their new sponsor and kit provider on a three-year contract (2010–2013). After half a decade without a sponsor, India&#x27;s TVS Motor Company tied up with the Bangladesh national team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC second round, in a deal which lasted for two years (2019–2021). In 2021, as the Bangladesh team was using the same kit for almost 5 years, the federation decided to hold a jersey designing contest for the 2021 SAFF Championship.
===Supporters===

In the 70s and 80s, football in Bangladesh flourished with a well-renowned Dhaka First Division League, attracting fans nationwide. However, since the 2000s, domestic football&#x27;s popularity has declined due to success in other sports and the national team&#x27;s lack of achievements. As a consequence, the National Stadium in Dhaka remains largely unoccupied during both domestic and international fixtures, with average attendance, even falling short of 10,000.

Outside the capital, both domestic and international football&#x27;s popularity remains unwavering, with games in Sylhet and Jessore, drawing tons of fans. In August 2014, 50,000 spectators were present during a friendly between Bangladesh U23 and Nepal U23 at the Sylhet District Stadium. It was reported that the fans entered the stadium by breaking the main entrance, due to shortage in tickets. The same year at the Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore, which has a capacity of 12,000 was filled with more than 30,000 viewers during a friendly match against Sri Lanka, which finished 1–1.

The first ever supporters group of the national team, the Bangladeshi Football Ultras, was formed in 2019.

===Bangladesh Red and Green===
The President&#x27;s Gold Cup which was predominantly held every year from 1981 to 1993, saw the Bangladesh Football Federation enter two teams for Bangladesh; Bangladesh Red and Green (1981–1986; 1993) and Bangladesh White and Blue (1987). This was due to the fact, that during the 80s many players were not able to get into the national team even after performing well in the country&#x27;s domestic league. Alongside the senior national team, the other national team mainly consisted of &quot;second string&quot; or youth international players. Having a two separate teams was very common during the 80s and 90s for developing South Asian countries, both Nepal (Nepal B) and Pakistan (Pakistan B) had second string team&#x27;s. Most international countries taking part in the President&#x27;s Gold Cup would not send their main national team, instead the tournament would be used as a platform to play their B teams.

The 1989 President&#x27;s Gold Cup saw Bangladesh Red win the tournament. The hosts, defeated South Korea University football team on penalties to lift the trophy, after knocking out the Green team in the semi-finals. However, this is not considered to be Bangladesh&#x27;s first international trophy, as the tournament mainly consisted of club teams. The green team was the youth national team, while the red team was made out of senior international&#x27;s, and was known to be the main national team. In the 1987 edition, Bangladesh White and Blue took part in the tournament. The white team mainly consisted of players from Mohammedan SC, while the blue team was made of players from their rival club, Abahani Limited Dhaka.

==Home stadium==
Bangladesh plays majority of their home matches at the National Stadium, Dhaka, where they won the 2003 SAFF Championship. Previously known as the Dhaka Stadium and Bangabandhu National Stadium, it was initially constructed in 1954, the Bangladesh Football Federation was given full authority to operate the stadium in 2004, and before that the Mirpur Stadium would regularly host home matches.

Before renovation in 2011, the National Stadium had a capacity close to 55,000, but with a new capacity of 36,000 it is still the largest stadium in Bangladesh. Ever since the inception of the Bangladesh Premier League in 2007, the stadium has been used to host majority of the league games. It has hosted the SAFF Championship on three occasions, in 2003, 2009 and most recently in 2018.

In 2021, the National Stadium again underwent renovation, and has been scheduled to resume operations from 2025. The refurbishments will see addition of chairs in galleries and installation of LED giant screens. The renovation is part of Bangladesh Football Federation&#x27;s plan of giving the nation a modernized stadium more suited for football. Occasionally home matches are also played at Sheikh Kamal Stadium in Nilphamari, Sylhet District Stadium in Sylhet, Rajshahi District Stadium in Rajshahi and Bashundhara Kings Arena in Dhaka.

<text>During the Pacific War the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force and Imperial Japanese Army Air Force conducted air raids on the Australian mainland, domestic airspace, offshore islands, and coastal shipping, attacking at least 111 times between February 1942 and November 1943. These attacks came in various forms; from large-scale raids by medium bombers, to torpedo attacks on ships, and to strafing runs by fighters.

In the first and deadliest set of attacks, 262 aircraft hit Darwin on the morning of 19 February 1942. Killing at least 235 people and causing immense damage, the attacks made hundreds of people homeless and resulted in the abandonment of Darwin as a major naval base.

These attacks were opposed by, and often aimed at, units and personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy, United States Army Air Forces, United States Navy, British Royal Air Force and Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force. Japanese aircrews also targeted civil infrastructure, including harbours, civil airfields, railways, and fuel tanks. Some civilians were also killed.

Although the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters, a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries in northern Australia also defended against Japanese air raids.

==Early Japanese air raids==
The Japanese conducted a series of air raids on Australia during February and March 1942. These raids sought to prevent the Allies from using bases in northern Australia to contest the conquest of the Netherlands East Indies.

===The first air raid on Darwin===

The bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942 was both the first and the largest attack mounted by Japan against mainland Australia, when four Japanese aircraft carriers (, , and ) launched a total of 188 aircraft from a position in the Timor Sea. These 188 naval aircraft inflicted heavy damage on Darwin and sank eight ships. A raid conducted by 54 land-based army bombers later the same day inflicted further damage on the town and RAAF Base Darwin and resulted in the destruction of 20 military aircraft. Allied casualties were 235 killed and between 300 and 400 wounded, the majority of whom were non-Australian Allied sailors. Only four Japanese aircraft (all navy carrier-borne) were confirmed to have been destroyed by Darwin&#x27;s defenders.

===The attack on Broome===

On 3 March 1942, nine Japanese A6M2 Zero fighters attacked the town of Broome, in northern Western Australia. Although Broome was a small town, it had become a significant air base and route of escape for refugees and retreating military personnel, following the Japanese invasion of Java. During the attack, which consisted of strafing runs only by the Zeros, at least 88 Allied civilians and military personnel were killed and 24 aircraft were lost. As Broome was almost undefended, Japanese losses were light, with only a single Zero being shot down over Broome and another one failing to reach its base.

==Attacks on North Queensland, July 1942==
Japanese naval flying boats conducted four small air raids on the north Queensland city of Townsville and the town of Mossman in late July 1942. Townsville, which was an important military base, was raided by Japanese Kawanishi H8K1 &quot;Emily&quot; flying boats operating from Rabaul on three nights in late July 1942. On the night of 25/26 July, the city was attacked by two flying boats but did not suffer any damage as the six bombs dropped by these aircraft fell into the sea. Townsville was attacked for the second time in the early hours of 28 July when a single flying boat dropped eight bombs which landed in bushland outside the city. Six P-39 Airacobras unsuccessfully attempted to intercept the Japanese aircraft. The third raid on Townsville occurred in the early hours of 29 July when a single flying boat again attacked the city, dropping seven bombs into the sea and an eighth which fell on an agricultural research station at Oonoonba, damaging a coconut plantation. This aircraft was intercepted by four Airacobras and was damaged. The fourth raid on north Queensland occurred on the night of 31 July when a single flying boat dropped a bomb which exploded near a house outside of Mossman, injuring a child.

<text>The East Pacific Rise (EPR) is a mid-ocean rise (usually termed an oceanic rise and not a mid-ocean ridge due to its higher rate of spreading that results in less elevation increase and more regular terrain), at a divergent tectonic plate boundary, located along the floor of the Pacific Ocean. It separates the Pacific plate to the west from (north to south) the North American plate, the Rivera plate, the Cocos plate, the Nazca plate, and the Antarctic plate. It runs south from the Gulf of California in the Salton Sea basin in Southern California to a point near , where it joins the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR) trending west-south-west towards Antarctica, near New Zealand (though in some uses the PAR is regarded as the southern section of the EPR). Much of the rise lies about off the South American coast and reaches a height about above the surrounding seafloor.

== Overview ==
The oceanic crust is moving away from the East Pacific Rise to either side. Near Easter Island the rate is over per year which is the fastest in the world. However, on the northern end, it is much slower at only roughly per year. On the eastern side of the rise, the eastward-moving Cocos and Nazca plates meet the westward moving South American plate and the North American plate and are being subducted under them. The belt of volcanos along the Andes and the arc of volcanoes through Central America and Mexico are the direct results of this collision. Due east of the Baja California peninsula, the Rise is sometimes referred to as the Gulf of California Rift Zone. In this area, newly formed oceanic crust is intermingled with rifted continental crust originating from the North American plate.

Near Easter Island, the East Pacific Rise meets the Chile Rise at the Easter Island and Juan Fernandez microplates, trending off to the east where it subducts under the South American plate at the Peru–Chile Trench along the coast of southern Chile. This portion of the Rise has been referred to as the Cape Adare-Easter Island Ridge, Albatross Cordillera, Easter Island Cordillera, Easter Island Rise, and Easter Island Swell.

Parts of the East Pacific Rise have oblique spreading, such as the Nazca–Pacific plate boundary between 29°S and 32°S. This is seafloor spreading that is not orthogonal to the nearest ridge segment.

The southern extension of the East Pacific Rise (the PAR) merges with the Southeast Indian Ridge at the Macquarie triple junction south of New Zealand. The southern stretch of the East Pacific Rise is also one of the fastest-spreading divergent boundaries on Earth, peaking at /year.

Along the East Pacific Rise the hydrothermal vents called black smokers were first discovered by the RISE project in 1979, and have since been extensively studied. These vents are forming volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits on the ocean floor. Many unique deep-water creatures have been found with vents, that subsist in a chemosynthetic ecosystem rather than one using photosynthesis.

<doc id="1268368" wikidata="Q880053" url="?curid=1268368" title="Black Artists Group">
<text>The Black Artists Group (BAG) was a multidisciplinary arts collective that existed in St. Louis, Missouri, from 1968 to 1972. BAG is known for the convergence of free jazz and experimental theater.

== Members ==
Members included saxophonists Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, J. D. Parran, Hamiet Bluiett, and Luther Thomas; trumpeters Baikida Carroll and Floyd LeFlore; trombonist Joseph Bowie; drummers Bensid Thigpen and Charles &quot;Bobo&quot; Shaw; bassist Bobby Reed, Arzinia Richardson; stage directors Malinke Robert Elliott, Vincent Terrell, and Muthal Naidoo; actors LeRoi S. Shelton; poets Ajule (Bruce) Rutlin and Shirley LeFlore; dancers Georgia Collins and Luisah Teish; and painters Emilio Cruz and Oliver Lee Jackson. While Jackson was not officially a member, he was deeply involved with BAG and is usually listed as a member. In addition, Ronnie Burrage was considered one of the youngest members (11 and 12 years old) of BAG as he began to perform with various members in 1971 and 1972.

== History ==
Members Oliver Lake, Lester Bowie, and Floyd LeFlore studied music in the jazz program at Sumner High School. They continued music education at Lincoln University alongside Julius Hemphill. Several members were drafted into military service, and all played music in St. Louis through the 1960s. Frustration with discrimination and limited opportunities brought the musical artists together with black actors marginalized from the theater scene, and they began collaborating on artistic productions around LaClede Town, the Circle Coffee Shop, and Berea Church.

While strongly influenced by Chicago&#x27;s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the Black Artists Group was unique in including artists from dance, theater, visual arts, and creative writing. They incorporated as a not-for-profit organization under the name &quot;The Black Artists&#x27; Group, Inc&quot; in 1968. BAG received major grant funding from the Danforth Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. In July 1969, the group paid $1 annual rent for a building at 2665 Washington Blvd.

Many of the BAG members relocated to Paris and then New York in the 1970s. A recording of a 1973 performance in Paris was released on an LP titled &quot;In Paris, Aries 1973&quot;; it was the only album ever issued under the BAG name until the 2024 release of &quot;For Peace And Liberty, In Paris Dec 1972&quot;.

== Legacy ==
BAG inspired other groups and artistic collectives to form around the United States and influenced Chicago&#x27;s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.

Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill and Hamiet Bluiett formed the African Continuum and organized the 1971 multimedia concert &quot;Images: Sons/Ancestors&quot; at Powell Symphony Hall, which was delayed by a bomb threat. They went on to form the World Saxophone Quartet and were notable in the &quot;loft-jazz&quot; scene of New York&#x27;s underground in the 1980s.

<doc id="1268370" wikidata="Q7606694" url="?curid=1268370" title="Stegner Fellowship">
<text>The Stegner Fellowship program is a two-year creative writing fellowship at Stanford University. The award is named after American Wallace Stegner (1909–1993), a historian, novelist, short story writer, environmentalist, and Stanford faculty member who founded the university&#x27;s creative writing program.

Ten fellowships are awarded every year, five in fiction and five in poetry. The recipients do not need a degree to receive the fellowships, though many fellows already hold the terminal M.F.A. degree in creative writing. A workshop-based program, no degree is awarded after the two-year fellowship. Prior to 1990, many fellows also enrolled in Stanford&#x27;s now-defunct M.A. program in creative writing.

Fellows receive a stipend of $50,000 per year, as well as health insurance and their tuition fee for Stanford. Fellows are required to live close enough to Stanford to be able to attend all workshops, as well as other department-related readings and events.

==History==
Stegner founded the Stanford creative writing department and fellowship program in 1946. Initial funding was supplied by Dr. E. H. Jones, brother of the chair of the Stanford English Department, Richard Foster Jones. Initially the fellowship was for three writing fellows per year, many of whom were World War II veterans returning home from overseas. In 1973, then-director John L&#x27;Heureux expanded the program to include eight fiction writers and eight poets per year. In 1992, the program expanded again to ten fiction writers and ten poets each year.

==Faculty==
The current poetry faculty for the program consists of A. Van Jordan, Amaud Jamaul Johnson, and Patrick Phillips. The current fiction faculty for the program consists of Elizabeth Tallent, Adam Johnson, Kirstin Valdez Quade, Chang-Rae Lee, and Molly Antopol. Louise Glück taught five workshops in poetry between 2015 and 2022 before her death in 2023.

Other notable writers often serve as guest instructors for a quarter as part of other endowed lectureships. Recent visiting writers include Heather McHugh, Nobel Laureate J. M. Coetzee, Bharati Mukherjee, Robert Pinsky, Colm Toibin, Li-Young Lee and, just before his death in 2004, Thom Gunn. Notable previous long-term faculty include W. S. Di Piero and Denise Levertov in poetry; and John L&#x27;Heureux and Nancy Packer in fiction.

<doc id="1268372" wikidata="Q3965155" url="?curid=1268372" title="Suspension of judgment">
<text>Suspended judgment is a cognitive process and a rational state of mind in which one withholds judgments, particularly on the drawing of moral or ethical conclusions. The opposite of suspension of judgment is &quot;premature judgement&quot;, usually shortened to &quot;prejudice&quot;. While prejudgment involves drawing a conclusion or making a judgment before having the information relevant to such a judgment, suspension of judgment involves waiting for all the facts before making a decision.

== Law ==
Suspension of judgment is used in civil law to indicate a court&#x27;s decision to nullify a civil judgment. Motions to set aside judgments entered in civil cases in the United States district courts are governed by Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which opens with the statement, &quot;On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LII / Legal Information Institute 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is quite straightforward and court room application is mostly as stated. In the New York Law Journal David Bliven argues that suspended judgement ought to be an alternative disposition in family offenses (a type of civil case), particularly in cases where a family judgement is being used as behavior modification rather than a reason to arrest.

More generally in jurisprudence, the ideal juror is expected to presume innocence of the person tried in court. And in the case of conviction, a suspended sentence is one of the possible sentences available to the court.

== Science ==

Suspension of judgment is a cornerstone of standard research methodology. Much of the scientific method is designed to encourage the suspension of judgments until observations can be made, tested, and verified through peer review. In 1877, Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth &quot;per se&quot; but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. He believed that the scientific method excels the other methods of reasoning by being designed to eventually arrive at the most secure beliefs. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth &quot;per se&quot; but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief&#x27;s integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

The advance of social science often depends on excluding cognitive bias, of which many forms are known.

== Philosophy ==
Within philosophy, suspension of judgment is typically associated with positivism and skepticism, most especially Pyrrhonism where it is referred to as epoché, but it is not limited to these areas. The 17th century rationalist René Descartes, for example, used it as the cornerstone of his epistemology. In a process that he called methodological skepticism (now also known as Cartesian doubt), he asserted that in order to gain a solid foundation when building one&#x27;s system of knowledge and belief, one must first doubt everything. Only by eliminating preconceptions and prejudgments can one come to know what is true.

Descartes&#x27; methodology is called hyperbolic doubt called so because it&#x27;s an extreme form of doubt, casting even slightly suspect into the light of further scrutiny. Hyperbolic doubt is posited in four general points:

#Only information that you know to be true should be accepted.
#Take known truths and break them down into their basic components.
#Solve the simplest problems first.
#Take the remaining problems and make complete lists of them.

Descartes goal in the 1641 &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; was to systematically doubt all beliefs and do a ground-up rebuild of only definitely true things as an undoubted basis for the sciences. As an example take a look at the opening line of the volume:

Through this work Descartes showed that unless one is very careful there are grounds to doubt the reasoning behind any knowledge. He states that this is mostly due to the unreliable nature of sensory knowledge and makes that case with the examples of the dream and the demon.

===The dream argument===
Descartes hypothesized that due to the possibility of very realistic dreams humans can only believe that we&#x27;re awake. Through the systematic procedure of &#x27;phenomenological reduction&#x27;, one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness. However, by the end of &quot;The Meditations&quot;, he concludes that in retrospect we can certainly distinguish dreaming and reality:

&quot;But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things I am not asleep but awake.&quot; — Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings

Dreaming is also a starting position for the speculation that we may be living in a simulation. Proponents of this viewpoint will sometimes argue that a particular type of simulated reality occurs nightly. The basic claim is that opponents of the simulation hypothesis that a sleeping mind is an unreliable mechanism for differentiated reality from illusion.

=== The Evil Demon ===
The idea of the &quot;evil demon&quot; (also known as the &quot;malicious demon&quot; or &quot;evil genius&quot;) is one of several methods of systematic doubt employed in the &quot;Meditations.&quot; Descartes reasoned that it could be possible for what he referred to as an evil demon to be controlling our experiences. There are some Cartesian scholars whom opine that the demon is omnipotent though omnipotence of the evil demon would be contrary to Descartes&#x27; hypothesis, as he rebuked accusations of the demon having omnipotence.

<doc id="1268373" wikidata="Q2248863" url="?curid=1268373" title="Sonic Drift">
<text>is a 1994 racing game based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; developed and published by Sega for the Game Gear. Players control one of four characters as they race to the finish line, with 18 tracks themed after levels in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

Although it was designed with inspiration from Nintendo&#x27;s 1992 game &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; shares gameplay similarities to &quot;Super Scaler&quot; games previously released by Sega. &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; was released exclusively in Japan; a western release was planned but later canceled due to concerns about its quality. &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; was later released worldwide as part of &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; in 2003 and the compilation game &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; in 2004. It was released again in 2023 as part of &quot;Sonic Origins Plus&quot;.

Reception to &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; was negative, with criticism for its gameplay and lack of difficulty. A sequel, &quot;Sonic Drift 2&quot;, was released in 1995.

==Gameplay and release==
&quot;Sonic Drift&quot; is the first racing game in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise. Players control one of four characters―Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Amy Rose, and Dr. Robotnik―and race around a series of tracks, with the objective being to cross the finish line in first place. 18 tracks are featured, based on the various zones of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, including the Green Hill Zone. &quot;Drift&quot; is the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game to feature Amy as a playable character.

There are three game modes: Chaos GP, a grand prix mode; Free Run, a practice mode; and Versus Mode, where players can compete with one another. Chaos GP contains three separate cups of six tracks each and a points system where the goal is to earn more points than the competition. Each cup is identified with a color: green, yellow, or red.

The gameplay of &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; shares similarities with Sega&#x27;s &quot;Super Scaler&quot;-type arcade games such as &quot;Out Run&quot; and &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot;, although with inspiration from Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Kart.&quot; Each character has strengths and weaknesses; for instance, Sonic has fast acceleration but poor control, while Robotnik has poor acceleration but moves at high speed. The top half of the player&#x27;s screen shows the course map, while the bottom displays the player&#x27;s car racing around the track. The game&#x27;s driving mechanics focus on drifting to steer around corners at speed. Driving into television monitors scattered around the track awards the player a power-up, such as invincibility. Tracks also contain gold rings that can be collected to use a special move, which is unique for each character; for example, Sonic gets a speed boost, while Tails gets a jump.

Developed in-house at Sega, &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; was released in Japan for the Game Gear on March 18, 1994. The western release was canceled due to concerns regarding the game&#x27;s quality. Sega instead released a Game Gear port of &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;. &quot;Sonic Drift 2&quot;, a sequel, was released worldwide for the Game Gear in 1995. In 2003, &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; was released as an unlockable extra in &quot;Sonic Adventure DX: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, and was later compiled into &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; in 2004&quot;,&quot; as well as &quot;Sonic Origins Plus&quot; on June 23, 2023.

==Reception==

&quot;Sonic Drift&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; was positive towards it in a preview, saying that the game was fast-paced and enjoyable but the flashing, choppy scrolling hampered the gameplay somewhat. Three reviewers for &quot;Sega Pro&quot; gave a negative review of the game, criticizing the track designs as too similar, poor cornering controls, and low difficulty. Reviewer Mark Hill concluded his part of the review with &quot;only a complete idiot would purchase a copy.&quot; The three reviewers were more positive about the game&#x27;s graphics and sound. According to Ulf Schneider of German magazine , &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; does not have the same quality of gameplay as &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; and he criticized the lack of vision of a corner until being just before one, but he also said the game was fun and easy to master even on Hard difficulty. He also commented that the controls could be figured out within a few laps of gameplay.

Retrospective feedback has been negative. The game&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; was negatively received; Chris Baker of &quot;GameSpy&quot; labeled it as &quot;almost unplayable&quot;, while Tom Bramwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it &quot;a terrible, terrible racing game whose flickering madness actually made me physically sick.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; in 2012 compared &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, disliking &quot;Drift&quot; for being too simplistic and very easy to finish, alongside the general lack of content and poor presentation. The reviewer stated, &quot;Too simple and too fast to finish, &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; is unfortunately not a title that will fascinate the crowds.&quot; The staff of &quot;USgamer&quot; identified &quot;Sonic Drift&quot;&#x27;s use of half the Game Gear&#x27;s screen for the course map as an issue, and called the game &quot;a poor man&#x27;s &quot;Out Run&quot;&quot;. Apollo Chungus of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; said that the gameplay itself was decent and solid, but felt that it was greatly lacking in content and variety. He criticized the track design in particular for being generally boring, lacking in presentation, and for the stage themes being purely cosmetic instead of affecting the track designs themselves. Chungus concluded his review by stating &quot;the small amount of content mean that it&#x27;s a racer only a small number of people will dedicate themselves to.&quot; &quot;GamesTM&quot; described the title as a &quot;lazy and cynical cash-in&quot;, saying that it did not understand what made &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; so successful.

<doc id="1268374" wikidata="Q17142062" url="?curid=1268374" title="Organ tablature">
<text>Organ tablature is a form of musical notation used by the north German Baroque organ school, although there are also forms of organ tablature from other countries such as Italy, Spain, Poland, and England. Portions of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Orgelbüchlein are written in tablature, as are a great deal of the surviving manuscripts of the organ works of Dieterich Buxtehude and other north German organ composers of the Baroque era.

The first extant example of keyboard tablature, which was almost certainly for organ, was in the &quot;Robertsbridge Codex&quot;, from about 1360. Although it is English, it is closely related to the later German tablatures. An early and perhaps seminal example of these organ tablatures is found in the &quot;Buxheimer Orgelbuch&quot; (Buxheim Organ Book), compiled in Münich in the 1460s. It reflects the work of Conrad Paumann, a blind organist, lutenist, and composer. The biggest organ tablature, as well as one of the oldest in the world, is Organ Tablature by Jan of Lublin (1537–48), one of ca. 20 Polish organ tablatures created from 1520 to 1700. An emblematic organ tablature of the early baroque era is the Linzer Orgeltabulatur, compiled between 1611 and 1613 and containing 108 pieces of mostly non-liturgical character.

The feature of organ tablature that distinguishes it from modern musical notation is the absence of staves, noteheads, and key signatures. Pitches are denoted by letter names written in script, durations by flags (much like modern notation), although in early notations durations were shown using mensural indications, and octave displacement by octave lines drawn above a letter. There was some variation in the notation of accidentals, but sometimes sharps were specified by the addition of a loop to the end of the letter. B natural and B flat were represented by &quot;h&quot; and &quot;b&quot; respectively. Naturals are not indicated, as accidentals do not carry through the entire measure as in modern notation. Key signatures are not specified; they are implied by the indicated sharps. In Renaissance works the uppermost melodic line is given in normal mensural notation on a staff, and the tablature given below each note.

Since the end of the Baroque era, organ tablature has not been used to an appreciable extent. Repertoire originally written in tablature has been translated into modern notation. However, this translation carries a risk of error. In German script an A and an E can become confused, as can an F and a G. Likewise, an octave line over a series of notes can begin or end ambiguously. Different solutions are given by different editors, and this is one manifestation of the improvisatory tradition of organ performance of the period.

<text>The Fernsehturm Heidelberg is a transmission tower for FM and DVB-T on the Königstuhl hill of Heidelberg at . It was the property of the City of Heidelberg and sold to the SWR. Because of its exposed location on the crest of the hill the tower itself is only 82 meters high.

The Heidelberg TV tower has an open-air observation deck 30 metres up its height, which can be reached by an elevator. The observation deck is now permanently closed for visitors due to safety concerns. The sale of the tower sealed the fate of the observation deck which used to enable tourist a spectacular 360 degrees view of the region.

In the first years of its existence the tower was also used as a water tower. The water tank is located within the main body behind the observation deck.

Public and private channels across 6 multiplexes are broadcast from the TV tower. In 2016, the tower was one of the first to introduce DVB-T2 in Germany.

4 analog FM radio channels are broadcast from this tower. SWR1 Baden-Württemberg (97.8 MHz), SWR Kultur (88.8 MHz), SWR3 (99.9 MHz) and SWR4 Baden-Württemberg (104.1 MHz). Also digital radio multiplexes (DAB+) are broadcast from this tower on DAB channels 5C, 9B, 9D, and 11B.

The Telecom Telecommunication Tower Heidelberg and former Telecommunication Tower of US-Forces Heidelberg (returned to the state of Baden-Württemberg) are located close by. Both are off limits to the public.

<doc id="1268388" wikidata="Q1533482" url="?curid=1268388" title="Jenny Haniver">
<text>A Jenny Haniver is the carcass of a ray or a skate that has been modified by hand then dried, resulting in a mummified specimen intended to resemble a fanciful fictional creature, such as a demon or dragon.
This practice dates back to the 16th century when these specimens were often sold as curiosities to sailors and collectors.

==Name==
One suggestion for the origin of the term was the French phrase (&quot;youth of Antwerp&quot;). British sailors &quot;cockneyed&quot; this description into the personal name &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot;.

==History==

Jenny Hanivers have been created to look like various mythical creatures, including devils, angels and dragons. Some writers have suggested the sea monk may have been a Jenny Haniver.

The earliest known picture of Jenny Haniver appeared in Konrad Gesner&#x27;s &quot;Historia Animalium vol. IV&quot; in 1558. Gesner warned that these were merely disfigured rays and should not be believed to be miniature dragons or monsters, which was a popular misconception at the time.

The most common misconception was that Jenny Hanivers were basilisks. As basilisks were creatures that killed with merely a glance, no one could claim to know what one looks like. For this reason it was easy to pass off Jenny Hanivers as these creatures, which were still widely feared in the 16th century.

In Veracruz, Jenny Hanivers are considered to have magical powers and are employed by curanderos in their rituals. This tradition is similar to one in Japan, where fake taxidermy ningyo (similar to Fiji mermaids) were produced and kept in temples.

== In popular culture ==
* The &quot;Jenny Haniver&quot; and &quot;Jenny Haniver II&quot; are airships in the &quot;Mortal Engines Quartet&quot; (2001–2006) series of novels by Philip Reeve, and a boat in one of its prequels, &quot;A Web of Air&quot; (2010).
* &quot;The Bermuda Depths,&quot; a 1978 fantasy film starring Leigh McCloskey and Connie Sellecca, featured the latter as a mysterious character named &quot;Jennie Haniver&quot;.
* In the 2022 video game &quot;Splatoon 3&quot;, a Jenny Haniver is available as a purchasable locker decoration under the name “mysterious dried thing”.
* In the table-top role-playing game &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, a haniver is a type of malevolent gremlin similar to a manta ray.

<doc id="1268389" wikidata="Q1519934" url="?curid=1268389" title="Indelibly Stamped">
<text>Indelibly Stamped is the second album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in 1971. It marked a dramatic change in direction to a more straightforward rock sound, and by admission of the band&#x27;s own liner notes, &quot;Travelled&quot; is the only song with any resemblance to their debut album. Like their debut, this album was a commercial failure upon release, but in later decades it went gold in France and Canada. Original editions have a colour gate-fold cover and different text for the band name and album title. The cover photograph features the tattooed torso and arms of a topless woman. This is the first Supertramp album issued in the U.S. The album was banned from a number of record stores in Australia, while others sold each copy inside a brown paper sleeve.

==Cover art==
The cover depicts the tattooed torso and arms of a topless woman. According to Paul Sayce, writing in &quot;Tattoo News&quot;, the model was Marion Hollier, who was extensively tattooed at the Les Skuse Tattoo Studio in the 1960s. An article published in &quot;The People&quot; shortly after the album&#x27;s release also identifies Hollier as the model, noting that she was paid £45 for the job ().

==Background==
Roger Hodgson later said &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot; was &quot;the survival album to put ourselves back in the good books of our manager. There was no theme worked out for the album and we were floundering.&quot; New members Kevin Currie and Frank Farrell were recruited shortly before the recording sessions.

The song &quot;Times Have Changed&quot; evolved out of a song called &quot;Times of Rain&quot;, which was written with Richard Palmer-James while he was still a member of the group. Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson wrote new lyrics to the song, renaming it &quot;Times Have Changed&quot;.

Supporting tours for the album began with a series of shows at the P.N. Club in Munich, which had been the site for Supertramp&#x27;s first public performances. Rick Davies described their stage show at the time as &quot;all Rock and Roll really. We used to get people up on the bloody stage and it was just chaos, hopping away doing about three encores, but there was meat and potatoes behind it. No more or less people would come to the next gig.&quot; This was the last album Roger Hodgson played bass during his tenure with Supertramp.

==Reception==
In his brief retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album was an improvement over their debut, but still indulged too much in lengthy instrumental sections.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, except where noted.

<doc id="1268391" wikidata="Q627421" url="?curid=1268391" title="Launched roller coaster">
<text>The launched roller coaster is a type of roller coaster that initiates a ride with high amounts of acceleration via one or a series of linear induction motors (LIM), linear synchronous motors (LSM), catapults, tires, chains, or other mechanisms employing hydraulic or pneumatic power, along a launch track. This mode of acceleration powers many of the fastest roller coasters in the world. 

==Electromagnetic==

===LIM / LSM===
Linear induction motor (LIM) and linear synchronous motor (LSM) coasters use propulsion via electromagnets, which utilize large amounts of electricity to propel the coaster train along its track into the ride elements (e.g. inversions, twists, turns and short drops). Ten design companies managing these types of rides are Vekoma, Intamin, Gerstlauer, Premier Rides, Maurer, Zierer, Mack Rides, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard, Rocky Mountain Construction and S&amp;S Worldwide. Both Rocky Mountain Construction and Bolliger &amp; Mabillard established their first LSM launched coasters recently with the RMC Topper Track Coaster, Lightning Rod, at Dollywood, and B&amp;M&#x27;s wingrider, Thunderbird, at HolidayWorld.

An example of an LSM launched roller coaster is Maverick at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.

These launch systems transfer electricity through a motor on the roller coaster&#x27;s track so that it controls the speed at which it will urge the cars and train either forward or backward on a segment. LIMs are mainly used in Premier Rides roller coasters and Intamin impulse and blitz coasters. However, LIMs can also be used for general transport, such as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover in Magic Kingdom or monorail and maglev trains.

==Fluid pressure==
===Hydraulic fluid===

Hydraulic-launched roller coasters, pioneered by Swiss manufacturer Intamin, give the riders greater acceleration with improved smoothness over the electromagnetic and catapult launch mechanisms. The acceleration from a hydraulic launch is greatest at the beginning and dies off rapidly, but the acceleration from a LIM/LSM launch remains fairly constant throughout the duration of the launch.

The core of the system involves powerful hydraulic pumps, usually eight, that are each capable of producing approximately 500 horsepower (373 kW). In Kingda Ka&#x27;s configuration, the system can produce a peak power of up to 20,800 hp (15.5 MW) for each launch. Hydraulic fluid is pumped into several different hydraulic accumulators – energy storing devices – containing two compartments that are separated by a piston. As the incompressible hydraulic fluid is pumped into one compartment, nitrogen in the other compartment is compressed. At launch, the fluid under pressure from the accumulators is used to drive a number of hydraulic motors (commonly 16 or 32), which spin a large winch drum that rewinds a cable attached to the lead car of the train, called the catch-car, in a matter of seconds. The cable runs under the launch track, and the catch-car moves along a groove in the track&#x27;s center.

The motor is positioned at the opposite end of the catch-car on the launch track. While the train inches forward into a ready position, the pusher mechanism moves back from the motor toward the train. Once the pusher connects, the anti-rollback braking system drops beneath the track, giving the train the green light to be launched.

The first hydraulic launch coaster was Xcelerator reaching in 2.3 seconds. The world&#x27;s tallest roller coaster, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure, was capable of reaching in 3.5 seconds. The fastest roller coaster in the world, Formula Rossa, reaches in 4 seconds using the hydraulic method.

Accelerator Coasters manufactured by Intamin commonly place a top hat element after the launch, which is a hill in the shape of a tower with a 90-degree ascent and 90-degree drop. Trains enter and exit this element in opposite directions. Top Thrill Dragster, built in 2003, includes this element followed by a brake run, while Kingda Ka, built in 2005, adds a airtime hill before the final brake run. Some hydraulic coaster layouts omit the top hat element altogether. Another manufacturer, Vekoma, began producing hydraulic-launched coasters in 2004 with the opening of Booster Bike at Toverland in the Netherlands, reaching speeds up to .

===Pneumatic (compressed air)===
Using the same type of system as a hydraulic launch, a pneumatic launch uses compressed air to launch the vehicle. The technology was developed by S&amp;S as the &quot;Thrust Air 2000&quot; model. The first coaster of this type was the &quot;Hypersonic XLC&quot;, opened at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia, USA in 2001. This coaster closed in 2007. Another incarnation, the Ring Racer, was open for only 4 days. Compressed air launches are able to provide more acceleration than traditional pneumatic launches, with Do-Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan having held the acceleration record from when it opened as Dodonpa in 2001 until its closure in 2024, launching passengers from 0 to 112 mph (180 km/h) in 1.56 seconds (this record is now held by Stealth at Thorpe Park, UK). S&amp;S has brought back pneumatic launches in China with OCT Thrust SSC1000 and Bullet Coaster at Happy Valley Wuhan and Happy Valley Shenzhen respectively. Maxx Force at Six Flags Great America marked the return of pneumatic launches in the United States.

==Other styles==
===Eddy current launcher (LEM)===
Magnets are placed under the cars and a series of flywheels coupled to aluminum discs is in the launch zone: there is no contact between the two. The system can be used also for speed up intermediate launchers, and for braking, with static aluminum blades, at the end of the ride. Thanks to the energy stored in the flywheels, the power demand for launching is flat. Two operating examples of this technique are the &quot;Drifter&quot; at Sochi Park in the Sochi Olimpic Park and at FunWorks, Abu Dhabi (manufacturer I.E.Park)

===Catapult===
In the catapult launch, a dropped weight winds a cable to pull the train until it accelerates to its full speed. Dropped weights were used in early installations of Shuttle Loop.

These rides are often not very tall, and usually achieve speeds of 60 mph (96 km/h).

===Flywheel===
Flywheel launches are used on some Anton Schwarzkopf designed shuttle loop coasters and Zamperla Motocoasters. A large flywheel is spun at high speeds and is attached to a cable that propels the train forward.

===Electric motor and spring tension===
Arrow Dynamics&#x27; Launched Loop coasters, which were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, use a powerful electric motor and tensioned springs to propel a launch car forward. The launch car pushes the train outward to a drop, and then returns to its position. After the train reaches the opposite platform, another catch car works the same way. An example of this is Irn Bru Revolution.

===Friction wheels===
Another type of launch is by friction wheels. The launch track consists of a series of horizontal tires that pinch the brake fins on the underside of the train. One example of this is the &quot;Incredible Hulk Coaster&quot; at Universal&#x27;s Islands of Adventure.

<doc id="1268406" wikidata="Q272577" url="?curid=1268406" title="Gibson Desert">
<text>The Gibson Desert is a large desert in Western Australia, largely in an almost pristine state. It is about in size, making it the fifth largest desert in Australia, after the Great Victoria, Great Sandy, Tanami and Simpson deserts. The Gibson Desert is both an interim Australian bioregion and desert ecoregion.

==Location and description==
The Gibson Desert is located between the saline Kumpupintil Lake and Lake Macdonald along the Tropic of Capricorn, south of the Great Sandy Desert, east of the Little Sandy Desert, and north of the Great Victoria Desert. The altitude rises to just above in places. As noted by early Australian explorers such as Ernest Giles large portions of the desert are characterized by gravel-covered terrains covered in thin desert grasses and it also contains extensive areas of undulating red sand plains and dunefields, low rocky/gravelly ridges and substantial upland portions with a high degree of laterite formation. The sandy soil of the lateritic &quot;buckshot&quot; plains is rich in iron. Several isolated salt-water lakes occur in the centre of the region and to the southwest a system of small lakes follow paleo-drainage features. Groundwater sources include portions of the Officer Basin and Canning Basin.

==Climate==
Rainfall in the Gibson Desert ranges from annually, while evaporation rates are in the range of per year. The climate is generally hot; summer maximum temperatures rise above whilst in winter the maximum may fall to and minimum winter temperatures dip to .

==Name==
The Gibson Desert was named by explorer Ernest Giles after a member of his party, Alfred Gibson, who became lost and presumably died in this desert during an expedition in 1874.

==Indigenous habitation==
In much of the region, especially the drier western portion, the majority of people living in the area are Indigenous Australians. In 1984, due to a severe drought which had dried up all of the springs and depleted the bush foods, a group of the Pintupi people who were living a traditional semi-nomadic desert-dwelling life, walked out of a remote wilderness in the central-eastern portion of the Gibson Desert (northeast of Warburton) and made contact for the first time with mainstream Australian society. They are believed to have been perhaps the last uncontacted tribe in Australia. On the eastern margin of the region, population centres (which include people of European descent) include Warburton, Mantamaru and Warakurna. Young Indigenous adults from the Gibson Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture.

<doc id="1268411" wikidata="Q5910404" url="?curid=1268411" title="Hot Snakes">
<text>Hot Snakes were an American rock band led by Rick Froberg and John Reis, formed in 1999 in San Diego, California. Reis and Froberg had previously performed together in Pitchfork and Drive Like Jehu, after which Reis found international success with Rocket from the Crypt. Hot Snakes disbanded in 2005 but reunited in 2011, remaining active until Froberg&#x27;s death in 2023.

Although they shared musical similarities with members&#x27; previous outfits, Hot Snakes forged a sound that was much more primal than that of Pitchfork, Drive Like Jehu or Rocket from the Crypt. Reis and Froberg were also heavily influenced by bands such as The Wipers, Suicide, and the Michael Yonkers Band, with these influences giving Hot Snakes a distinctive sound that has been described by &quot;PunkNews&quot; as &quot;hardcore garage punk.&quot; The band&#x27;s recordings and merchandise were produced using principles of DIY, with Froberg providing all of the artwork and Reis releasing the material via his Swami Records label.

==History==
===1999–2001: Formation and &quot;Automatic Midnight&quot;===
As youths growing up in San Diego, Reis and Froberg had played together in the post-hardcore band Pitchfork from 1986 to 1990. Following that they formed Drive Like Jehu, which gained the attention of major labels and resulted in a record contract with Interscope Records. By this time, however, Reis had become seriously involved with his other band, Rocket from the Crypt, and in 1995 Drive Like Jehu stopped playing together. Reis would continue to work with Rocket From the Crypt until 2005, while Froberg moved to New York to start a career as visual artist and illustrator.

Hot Snakes essentially began as a &quot;side project&quot; in 1999 while Reis was taking time off from Rocket from the Crypt, who were in between record labels and had lost their longtime drummer Atom Willard. While searching for a new record label and drummer, Reis started his own label Swami Records and experimented with other musicians, resulting in the formation of both Hot Snakes and the Sultans. Hot Snakes originated when Reis recorded a batch of songs with The Delta 72 drummer Jason Kourkounis, then contacted former bandmate Froberg to contribute vocals to the tracks. Most of this recording session was released in 2000 as Hot Snakes&#x27; first album &quot;Automatic Midnight&quot;, which was the first release by the Swami label.

Although Reis and Froberg had previously collaborated in bands, Hot Snakes represented a new challenge logistically: Reis lived in San Diego, Froberg in New York, and Kourkounis in Philadelphia. This resulted in sporadic and intense touring and recording schedules. When a full touring band was needed, Gar Wood (Beehive and the Baracudas, Tanner, Fishwife) was called in to play the bass guitar. After some touring Reis returned to work full-time with Rocket from the Crypt.

===2002–2004: &quot;Suicide Invoice&quot; and &quot;Audit in Progress&quot;===
In 2002 Hot Snakes reconvened to record the album &quot;Suicide Invoice&quot; and tour the United States. The following year Kourkounis left the band to play full-time with Burning Brides, and Reis once again returned to work with Rocket from the Crypt. When Hot Snakes again returned to the recording studio in 2004, Rocket from the Crypt drummer Mario Rubalcaba (also of The Black Heart Procession, Clikatat Ikatowi, Earthless, 411, and Chicanochrist) was brought in to play the drums. The album &quot;Audit in Progress&quot; was released and the band extensively toured the United States, as well as Europe and Australia. 

While on tour in the United Kingdom that fall, the band recorded several songs for BBC radio at British DJ John Peel&#x27;s recording studio. Their performance would be one of the last for Peel&#x27;s program, as he died shortly afterwards. This session was released as the &quot;Peel Sessions&quot; EP, which replaced a planned single for the song &quot;Braintrust&quot; in the UK market.

===2005–2006: Breakup and &quot;Thunder Down Under&quot;===

In May 2005, while on tour in Australia, Hot Snakes recorded a live in-studio performance at ABC studios for Australian radio station triple j. On their return to the US, Reis announced that the band was breaking up. &quot;Audit in Progress&quot; was named &quot;best punk album&quot; at the 2005 San Diego Music Awards, and shortly after Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would also be breaking up. That fall, Hot Snakes contributed a cover of the Government Issue song &quot;Time to Escape&quot; to the soundtrack to the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot; video game. This was the last song recorded by the band. Their live Australian radio session was released posthumously in 2006 as &quot;Thunder Down Under&quot;.

Following the breakup of both Hot Snakes and Rocket from the Crypt, Reis focused his energy on running the Swami Records label. He continued to perform occasionally with Rubalcaba in the Sultans until that band&#x27;s breakup in January 2007. Rubalcaba also plays in the San Diego band Earthless and is part owner of an independent record store called Thirsty Moon Records. Wood continues to record music and play in Beehive and the Barracudas, while Froberg resides in New York and works as a visual artist and illustrator. In early 2008 Froberg debuted a new musical act called Obits, while Reis, Wood, and Kourkounis reunited in The Night Marchers.

===2010–2023: Reunion and Froberg&#x27;s death===
On July 29, 2010 The Night Marchers and Obits performed together at The Casbah in San Diego; for the encore, the original Hot Snakes lineup of Reis, Froberg, Wood, and Kourkounis reunited to perform &quot;If Credit&#x27;s What Matters I&#x27;ll Take Credit&quot;, &quot;Automatic Midnight&quot;, and &quot;No Hands&quot;. The following year Hot Snakes reunited, with Kourkounis and Rubalcaba taking turns on drums, for a series of gigs including All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties and Fun Fun Fun Fest. The band toured the West Coast of the United States from March to April 2012, and performed at the Metallica-curated Orion Music + More festival in New Jersey in June.

On August 14, 2017, Hot Snakes announced a fall tour starting in November as well as new album tentatively scheduled for release in spring 2018 via Sub Pop. Hot Snakes&#x27; discography was also subsequently reissued by Sub Pop. As promised, &quot;Jericho Sirens&quot; was released in 2018 to positive reviews.

In June 2023, Froberg revealed on Instagram that a fifth Hot Snakes record was &quot;very near done&quot;. Froberg died two weeks later on June 30, 2023, at the age of 55.

<doc id="1268413" wikidata="Q318925" url="?curid=1268413" title="Cambodia national football team">
<text>The Cambodia national football team (Khmer: ក្រុមបាល់ទាត់ជម្រើសជាតិកម្ពុជា, &quot;Krŏm Băltoăt Chômreus Chéatĕ Kâmpŭchéa&quot;) is the men&#x27;s national football team that represents Cambodia in association football. It is affiliated with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and the regional ASEAN Football Federation (AFF). The team was founded in 1954 and is administered by the Football Federation of Cambodia (FFC).

==History==
===Beginning of an era===
Cambodia formed its first national team following the end of French colonization in 1954. Immediately following the end of French colonialism, Cambodia played its first home game against Malaya in 1956. The game ended with a 9–2 win for the Malayans.Like most Asian countries at the time, Cambodia did not seek to participate in the FIFA World Cup qualification nor even AFC Asian Cup qualification, as the country was still trying to consolidate its early football development. However, when Lon Nol decided to topple the Cambodian Kingdom and replaced by a Republic, Cambodia finally decided to participate in the 1972 AFC Asian Cup qualification. The Cambodians managed to qualify for the 1972 AFC Asian Cup in its first qualification attempt, a major success up to date. Cambodia managed to win over Hong Kong, which sent the country to Thailand.

In the tournament as Khmer Republic, the Cambodians lost to Iran and had to play in group B along with South Korea and Kuwait. Despite early loss to the South Koreans, they had qualified to the semi-finals thanked for a resounding 4–0 win over Kuwait, only got beaten later by Iran, again, and Thailand, and won the 4th place overall. It remains as Cambodia&#x27;s greatest achievement in an international tournament.

Following the success, Cambodia could not participate in further tournaments, due to the eventual rise of the Khmer Rouge.

===1990s to 2010s===
After decades of war, in which witnessed both Khmer Rouge&#x27;s genocide and the later Vietnamese invasion which toppled the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia returned to international football in 1993. Cambodia&#x27;s first tournament as a new team was the 1996 AFF Championship, in which Cambodia was defeated in all four matches. In this tournament, although Cambodia was the weakest among all teams participating in the tournament, Cambodia demonstrated high spirit of football. However, in successive tournaments, Cambodia was not successful and they could not manage to play with high spirits as it used to be. Despite this, Cambodia still gave birth to what would one of Cambodia&#x27;s football talents in its young history, Hok Sochetra.

Also during this time, Cambodia sent its national team to the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification, the first time Cambodia had ever done so. However, Cambodia had been unsuccessful by large, and often got eliminated in the bottom of their group. The country also withdrew from participating in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. Likewise, Cambodia also only participated in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification, before withdrew from 2004 and 2007 qualification attempts. The country later suffered AFF Championship drought, failing to qualify for three consecutive tournaments.

===2010s and 2020s===


Cambodia&#x27;s football has witnessed resurgence after decades being under shadows. The resurgence of Cambodia had begun with the arrival of South Korean Lee Tae-hoon, who had introduced a significant development of football in the country, with the change of its tactics, as well as youth development and promotion of Cambodian youngsters to the national team, has given hopes of change. At this team, the team has a lot of young talents, notably Chan Vathanaka, the first ever Cambodian to play professional football outside Cambodia, and the fanbase increased as for the achievement. Cambodia once again demonstrated a full spirit of football, despite during the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage, they didn&#x27;t win and also missed out the 2012 and 2014 AFC Challenge Cups, thus missing out in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

During 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Cambodia finished bottom in a group where they suffered losses to Jordan and neighbour Vietnam. Despite this, Cambodia has managed what could be the country&#x27;s greatest achievement in their qualification history, when they defeated Afghanistan, ranked 158 in that time, above Cambodia which was ranked 174, and had already defeated Cambodia twice in the World Cup qualification, 1–0 at home. It was the country&#x27;s only win in the qualification and is still regarded to be Cambodia&#x27;s best performance in its modern football history.

Following its failure to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Cambodia participated in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification first round where it beat Pakistan 4–1 on aggregate over two legs to reach the second round being drawn with Hong Kong, Bahrain, Iraq and Iran. On 5 September 2019 in the first fixture, Cambodia obtained a 1–1 draw at home to Hong Kong, 5 days later, it lost against Bahrain 1–0. 
In August 2020, Félix Dalmás left their post after completing their contract while on 7 April 2021, fellow countrymen, Ryu Hirose was unveiled as the new head coach of the Cambodia taking the team whenever manager Keisuke Honda is unavailable. Hirose task is to guide Cambodia for the remaining matches of the second round qualifiers of the FIFA 2022 World Cup qualification. Cambodia went on to undergo 2 defeats to Iran, their worst ever defeat, 14–0 on 10 October 2019 and then 10–0 on 11 June 2021 seeing Cambodia picking up a solitary point in its group.

Honda and Hirose would left the national team following 2022 AFF Championship exit. Dalmás would be re-appointed again as the head coach. On the first round of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Cambodia were drawn against Pakistan again like in the previous qualification. However Cambodia failed to qualify to the second round this time, as they were defeated 1–0 on aggregate.

In 2024, FIFA invited Cambodia to the 2024 FIFA Series tournament held in Jeddah where they faced CAF continent Equatorial Guinea and CONCACAF continent Guyana but lost 2–0 and 4–1 respectively.

Cambodia was then placed in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification play-off round where they would face Sri Lanka in September 2024.

==Team image==
From 2010 to 2022, the home kit was a blue and black shirt with black shorts and blue socks; while the original away kit was all white with a series of horizontal red stripes on the shirt. FBT sponsored this version of the kit.

On May 27, 2022, the team announced its new kit collection. The Khmer sportswear company, Varaman established in February 2022 sponsored them with designs by HCD football agency Clan United. The designs are based upon the flag of Cambodia, with the blue and red tones from the flag featured along with a pattern made from pixelated images of Angkor Wat. The 2022 home shirt uses a 3 toned blue digital camouflage design. The away shirt is all white fabric, with a zoomed in section of the pattern decorated in faint blue and red tones whilst being separated by patterns and shapes. To match each set, the goalkeeper kits are red and blue for home and away respectively. The repeated element is &quot;slightly off-coloured&quot; from the base fabric. The training kits are blue, red, and white with a graffiti styled pattern on each.

==Stadiums==
Cambodia&#x27;s home stadium is the Morodok Techo National Stadium with a capacity of 75,000, and associated facilities, was anticipated to be used to facilitate international friendly matches and regional qualifiers which was opened in August 2021 while their former home ground, the National Olympic Stadium will be second in line to host international matches.

<text>Crime of the Century is the third studio album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in October 1974 on A&amp;M Records. &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; was Supertramp&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in many countries, most notably in the UK, Canada and Germany where it peaked in the Top 5 while also making the Top 20 in Australia and France. It was an improvement over their previous sales in the US, but still only peaked at No. 38, with the US hit being &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;. &quot;School&quot; was another popular track, particularly on album rock-oriented radio stations. The album was eventually certified Gold in the US in 1977 after the release of &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot;. In Canada, it was eventually certified Diamond (sales of one million copies). The album was Supertramp&#x27;s first to feature drummer Bob Siebenberg (at the time credited as Bob C. Benberg), saxophone and clarinet player and vocalist John Helliwell, bassist Dougie Thomson, and co-producer Ken Scott. The album has received critical acclaim, including its inclusion in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;.

The album&#x27;s dedication reads &quot;To Sam&quot;, which is a nickname for Stanley August Miesegaes, the Dutch millionaire who supported the band financially from 1969 to 1972.

==Background and recording==
After the commercial failure of their first two albums and an equally unsuccessful tour, it looked like the end of Supertramp, but Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson revitalized the band, recruiting drummer Bob C. Benberg, woodwinds player and backing vocalist John Helliwell, and bassist Dougie Thomson. Their record label, A&amp;M, in particular A&amp;R man Dave Margereson (who would become their manager for the next ten years), sent this new line-up to a seventeenth-century farm in west Dorset to rehearse their next album together.

The album was recorded at several studios, including Trident Studios and Ramport Studios (owned by the Who), with co-producer Ken Scott. While recording the album, Davies and Hodgson recorded approximately 42 demo songs, from which only 8 were chosen to appear on the album. 

Six tracks were first recorded, for the soundtrack of Tony Klinger″s 1971 film &quot;Extremes&quot; &quot;about British youth, lifestyles and drug addiction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestrangebrew/tony-klinger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Several other tracks appeared on later albums such as (&quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; and &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot;).

Due to a contractual agreement, all the songs are credited jointly to the two writers, but some of the songs were written individually. Scott commented that Davies and Hodgson &quot;were very, very different personalities. Those differing personalities made the music sound the way it did.&quot; &quot;Asylum&quot;, &quot;Rudy&quot; and &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot; were written by Davies, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;If Everyone Was Listening&quot;, and &quot;Hide in Your Shell&quot; were written by Hodgson, and both &quot;School&quot; and &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; are Davies/Hodgson collaborations.

Hodgson remarked of &quot;Hide in Your Shell&quot;: &quot;I was 23 when I wrote that song, confused about life and like a lot of people are at that age, trying to hide my insecurities. I’ve always been able to express my innermost feelings more openly in song and &#x27;Hide in Your Shell&#x27; came to me at a time when I was feeling very lonely – lonely both in life and within the band – with no one who shared my spiritual quest.&quot;

&quot;Dreamer&quot; was composed by Hodgson on his Wurlitzer piano at his mother&#x27;s house when he was 19 years old. At that time he recorded a demo of the song using vocals, Wurlitzer, and banging cardboard boxes for percussion. Hodgson recalled: &quot;I was excited – it was the first time I laid hands on a Wurlitzer.&quot; Supertramp cut their own recording of the song in imitation of this early demo. Hodgson also stated on &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; while talking about the making of the album that the band had difficulty recreating the song when recording it.

Another of Hodgson&#x27;s philosophical musings, &quot;If Everyone Was Listening&quot;, was inspired by the &quot;As You Like It&quot; adage &quot;All the world’s a stage, and all the men are merely players&quot;. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the message of the song is, &quot;Not knowing what’s going on in everyone’s mind is just another form of not being in control. The fear comes not from the absence of knowledge of another person’s thought process, but rather from confronting the fact that we have no control over anything.&quot; The song would later provide the title track for Michael Ball&#x27;s 2014 album of the same name.

The album was named after the final song, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, which the band members felt was the strongest song on the album. The phrase “Crime of the Century” is a sensationalist trope which has been applied to various notorious crimes in history. Its application to more than one crime per century speaks to its hyperbolic nature.

Shortly after his departure from Supertramp, Hodgson commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve had more people come up to me and say that that song touched them more deeply than any other. That song really came together when we were living together at Southcombe Farm, Thorncombe, and just eating, sleeping, and breathing the ideas for the album. The song just bounced between Rick and I for so many weeks before it finally took form.&quot; For unknown reasons, in several interviews both before and since, Hodgson has attributed the song as being written solely by Davies.

Hodgson describes &quot;School&quot; as &quot;my song basically&quot; but admits that Davies wrote both the piano solo and a good deal of the lyrics. Interviewed by Jeff Parets of Acoustic Storm in 2010, Hodgson confirmed that the song was based on his experience at boarding school and said of the girl&#x27;s scream: &quot;Everything, especially that scream that you&#x27;re talking about just before the band comes in, does represent a lot... I mean, you know, school is a wonderful place. Obviously, it&#x27;s a school playground but that scream does represent a lot more.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Nick DeRiso rated &quot;School&quot; as Supertramp&#x27;s 3rd greatest song, calling it a &quot;jazz fusion-informed gem&quot; and praising its &quot;free-form creativity,&quot; &quot;plaintive lyric&quot; and &quot;stirring musical specificity.&quot;

On the &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; episode devoted to the album, Hodgson stated that &quot;Rudy&quot; was the character on the album and was seen as somewhat autobiographical of Davies&#x27; life at the time. The sound of the train in &quot;Rudy&quot; was recorded at London Paddington station, while the crowd noises in the song were taken from Leicester Square.

Hodgson and Davies both stated that communication within the group was at a peak during the recording of this album, while drummer Siebenberg stated that he thought it was this album on which the band hit its &quot;artistic peak&quot;.

&quot;Crime of the Century&quot; deals loosely with themes of loneliness and mental stability. Davies consciously linked the opening track &quot;School&quot; to &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot; with the line &quot;So you think your schooling is phoney&quot;, and according to Hodgson, any unifying thread beyond that was left to the listener&#x27;s imagination.

==Artwork==
The photograph for the cover was Paul Wakefield&#x27;s first album work. A&amp;M Records&#x27; art director Fabio Nicoli invited Wakefield to the studio where the band were recording and had him read the lyrics. With the album title already chosen, Wakefield started asking himself &quot;what an appropriate sentence could be for &#x27;the crime of the century&#x27;&quot; and combined it with a line from the song &quot;Asylum&quot;: &quot;when they haunt me and taunt me in my cage.&quot; One of his ideas, a prison cell window floating in space with a person silently screaming through the bars, was approved by the band, and when Wakefield started to develop the idea, he reduced the prisoner to just hands clutching the bars, &quot;a resignation to fate that the other didn’t have. It felt like there would be no reprieve.&quot; A friend made the set of polished aluminum bars and welded it to a stand, and underneath it Wakefield&#x27;s twin brother grabbed the bars, with his hands whitened with stage make-up. Through multiple exposure, Wakefield shot 12 pictures on transparency film, which he then combined with a back-lit starscape, that was actually a black card sheet filled with holes in a darkened studio. Half of the resulting pictures had the expected result. The back cover photograph, featuring band members in their underwear holding dress suits and top hats, was originally made when the album cover was meant to be a gatefold.

&quot;Crime of the Century&quot; was Supertramp&#x27;s first U.S. Top 40 album and was eventually certified Gold in the U.S. in 1977, after the release of &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot;. The album also marked the commercial breakthrough for the band in the United Kingdom; &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; peaked at number four in the album chart in March 1975, and &quot;Dreamer&quot; reached number thirteen on the singles chart in the same month. The album was particularly successful in Canada, staying on the album chart for over two years, peaking at number four, and being certified Diamond (10 x platinum) signifying sales of over one million copies.

In 1978, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; was ranked 108th in &quot;The World Critic Lists&quot;, which recognised the 200 greatest albums of all time as voted for by notable rock critics and DJs. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was ambivalent towards the album&#x27;s &quot;straight-ahead art-rock&quot;, which he called &quot;Queen without preening. Yes without pianistics and meter shifts.&quot; Adam Thomas&#x27;s retrospective review in &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; described it as one of the better albums of the 1970s for its powerful expression of young adult confusion and alienation, and for its consistent contrast between prog and pop elements.

In the 1987 edition of &quot;The World Critic Lists&quot;, CBC&#x27;s Geoff Edwards ranked &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; the 10th greatest album of all time. A 1998 public poll, aggregating the votes of more than 200,000 music fans, saw &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; voted among the all-time top 1000 albums, and it was listed in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2015, it was chosen as the 27th greatest progressive rock album by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Paul Elliott of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine called it a progressive rock masterpiece.

Many of the songs on the album remained staples of the band&#x27;s shows well into the 21st century (&quot;School&quot;, &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, &quot;Rudy&quot;, and the title song). Almost all of the album appears on the band&#x27;s 1980 live album &quot;Paris&quot; although the tracks that feature orchestrations on the studio versions (&quot;Asylum&quot;, &quot;Rudy&quot;, and &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;) were replaced by string synthesisers or Oberheim synthesisers, which were played mainly by Helliwell with some help from Hodgson. Hodgson has also included songs from the album (&quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Hide in Your Shell&quot;, &quot;School&quot; and &quot;If Everyone Was Listening&quot;) in his concerts.

==Releases==
The first release was on vinyl by A&amp;M Records in 1974. In 1977, it became the first pop music LP title re-issued by the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. A&amp;M released it as one of the first CDs in its &quot;Audio Master Plus&quot; series in 1984, which it then reissued in 1990. Mobile Fidelity also released its own remastered CD version on a gold disc as part of its &quot;Ultradisc&quot; series, in November 1984.

A new remastered CD version of the album was released by A&amp;M in 1997, followed by a different remaster on 11 June 2002. The newer A&amp;M remasters feature all of the album art restored plus credits and full lyrics, which were missing from some earlier editions. Both 1997 and 2002 A&amp;M remasters were from the original tapes by Greg Calbi and Jay Messina at Sterling Sound in New York.

The 1997 remaster has all tracks peaking at 100 per cent, significantly altering the original dynamic range of the recording and effectively adding new distortion to the sound. The 2002 edition is not quite as loud but still has much of the same effect.

The album was re-issued by German audiophile label Speaker&#x27;s Corner in 1999, as a 180 gram vinyl LP. It has none of the dynamic range compression applied to the A&amp;M remastered CD versions.

It was announced in October 2014 that the album, remastered by Ray Staff, would be reissued in CD, digital download, and 180g vinyl formats on 9 December 2014. In addition to the original album, the release would include a complete recording of a 1975 Hammersmith Odeon concert, a 24-page booklet of photographs, and an essay written by Phil Alexander with new interviews with Ken Scott, Dave Margereson, and most of the band members. Two 10×8 prints and a longer version of the essay were announced as exclusives of the vinyl version.

<doc id="1268429" wikidata="Q4921171" url="?curid=1268429" title="Black Liberators">
<text>The Black Liberators was a militant civil-rights organization formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in the spring of 1968. The Liberators were led through most of their short existence by Charles Koen, who went on to organize a nationally noted civil-rights campaign in Cairo, Illinois.

The organization was strongly inspired by the Black Panther Party, which had established a firm base in the neighboring city of Chicago, adopting the party military-style uniforms, radical rhetoric, and black self-determination. The Black Liberators group was formally established in the summer of 1968 by veteran St. Louis civil rights activist Charles Koen opening a formal headquarters at 2810 Easton in downtown St. Louis. Just as the Black Panthers had adopted a Ten-Point Program, the Black Liberators adopted a five-point programme:

#That we be given a chance to prove ourselves as other men have done. 
#That we gain enough living space to find ourselves and prove ourselves as full-fledged citizens. 
#That we plan to do for ourselves in all areas of human living. 
#That we move out and up into human dignity. 
#That we have sufficient funds to carry our creativity to fruition.

On August 17, 1969, the Black Liberators served as protection for African-American Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. who represented New York City&#x27;s historically black Harlem district. The following month the 9th Precinct of the Saint Louis Police Department was shot at by an unknown assailant and an African-American member of the police board had his real estate office firebombed, the metropolitan police suspected the Liberators.

Following these events, the Black Liberators&#x27; headquarters were substantially damaged, according to witnesses, by plainclothes police officers. Matters escalated when, eight days later, police arrested Charles Koen and Leon Dent for carrying a concealed weapon during a traffic stop, which was later determined to be a comb.

Following the arrest, Koen and Dent received strong public support from groups such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 688, NAACP, and &quot;St. Louis Argus&quot;.

In response to the arrest, the Liberators voted in favor of Yusuf Shabazz to succeed Koen as prime minister of the group, resulting in the decline and eventual end of the group. Nine months following his inauguration, Shabazz was arrested for mail fraud, and during court proceedings it was revealed that Shabazz had been operating as an informant for the metropolitan police.

Sonic Drift 2 was later released worldwide as part of &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; in 2003 and the compilation game &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; in 2005. It was released again in 2023 as part of &quot;Sonic Origins Plus&quot;.

==Gameplay==

Similar to &quot;Sonic Drift&quot;, &quot;Sonic Drift 2&quot; is a kart racing game. Players drive into the direction of the screen and around corners, including by drifting. They can also drive into video monitors on the track to pick up various power-ups, such as mines that can be used as a weapon, and a star that freezes all opponents. Rings on the track can be collected to use special abilities unique to each character. Alongside Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Dr. Eggman returning from the first game, there are three additional playable characters: Metal Sonic, Fang, and Knuckles.

Tracks in the game are based on locations from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, as well as original to the game. Some tracks are circuits, while others are linear point-to-point courses. Various road hazards are present and create further obstacles for players to avoid.

There are three gameplay modes. In the Chaos GP mode, players are awarded with Chaos Emeralds should they come in first place in a race. Free Run mode allows for players to test drive on the game&#x27;s tracks alone, and Versus mode allows for competitive multiplayer, which requires two consoles and a link cable.

==Reception==
Like its predecessor, Sonic Drift 2 was met with mixed to negative reviews from critics. On release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the game a 19 out of 40. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Sir Garnabus commented that, &quot;Hairpin turns, bombs in the road, and competitors who never give up make &quot;Sonic Drift 2&quot; Game Gear racing at its best.&quot; He also praised the detailed graphics, controls, and the use of a different musical piece for each track.

<text>The Brazil socio-geographic division is a slightly different division than the Brazilian division by regions. It separates the country into three different and distinctive regions:

*Amazônia Legal
*Centro-Sul
*Nordeste

Historically, the different regions of Brazil had their own migratory movements, which resulted in racial differences between these areas. The Southern region had a greater impact of the European immigration and has a large White majority, which contrasts with the Northern and Northeastern regions, which have a large Pardo (mixed-race) majority.

In Northern Brazil, the main racial contribution was of the native Amerindians, with a smaller European and African influence. In Northeastern Brazil, the main contribution was of Africans, with a smaller European and Amerindian influence. In Southeastern Brazil, the main contribution was of Europeans, with a smaller African and Amerindian influence.

== Socio-geographic distinction ==
This does not separate the country by borders of states. The north of Minas Gerais, for example, is in the socio-geographic division of Nordeste, but its southern part is in Centro-Sul.

 However, it is not very used, mainly because it is unofficial; all official information by IBGE is listed by the criteria of regions. The division by Socio-Geographic similarities is used mainly in universities and private companies, and it is little mentioned at regular school (grades 6–10).

== Regions ==

===South===
The South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Whites. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 79.6% of the population. In colonial times, this region had a very small population.

The region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs. Only a few settlers from São Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast.

To stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal. They established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florianópolis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina&#x27;s population in the late 18th century. The state of Paraná was settled by colonists from São Paulo due to their proximity (Paraná was part of São Paulo until the mid-19th century).

With the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, enslaved Africans began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Blacks were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul&#x27;s population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.

After independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established São Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland-Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers.

To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (&quot;New Hamburg&quot;).

From São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region.
In the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside. Until 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state.

Another immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Gaúcha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gonçalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities.

They created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native &quot;gaúchos&quot;. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Criciúma, and later also spread further north, to Paraná.

A significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil, 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paraná received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, São Matheus do Sul, Irati, and União da Vitória. Russians and Ukrainians are present as well.

===Southeast===

The Southeastern region of Brazil is the ethnically most diverse part of the country. Whites make up 58.8% of its population, and those of mixed-race and African descent make up, together, 40.2%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and small Amerindian community (0.2%).

Southeast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, São Vicente, São Paulo, established in 1532. The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Whites, Indians and Blacks. The Amerindians of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese. The race mixing between the Indian females and their White masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of São Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was Língua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words.

In the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil, and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas&#x27; War. The Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the richness, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines. They were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an &quot;African city&quot;: most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had so many slaves, since the end of the Roman Empire. In 1808 the Portuguese royal family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15 thousand Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European.

After independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was &quot;inundated&quot; by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within São Paulo. The vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. A large numbers of Italians are apparent in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. Northeast São Paulo is 65% Italian, for example.

The arrival of immigrants from several places of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.
===Northeast===
The population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as &quot;brown&quot; make up 62.5% of the population. Those reported as Black account for 7.8%.

This region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants.

The ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of Black slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of Black and White ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest Black city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and White mixture.

===North===
Northern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region.

Many people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Ceará, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority.

===Central-West===

The Central-West Region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.

A new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.

<text>The Coalition Against the Marcos Dictatorship was a North America-based antiimperialist organization that was at the center of the international movement opposing the dictatorship of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos from the 1970s. 

CAMD changed its name to Committee to Advance the Movement for Democracy and Independence (CAMDI) in February 1986, after the People Power Revolution toppled the corrupt and brutal Marcos regime.

==History==
Following the proclamation of martial law in the Philippines, the &quot;Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino&quot; (KDP) was established in July 1973 by young activists and students in Santa Cruz, California. It had a dual program of supporting the national democratic revolution in the Philippines and fighting for social justice in the United States. Its founders wrote: “[In] the struggle for national democracy in the Philippines,” the KDP must address the “exploitation and racist oppression of U.S. monopoly-capitalism” in America and in the Philippines.

In 1974, the KDP was among various anti-martial law groups to petition the U.S. Congress to stop support for Marcos. The campaign was followed by the first national anti-martial law conference in Chicago. The conference established the National Coordinating Committee of the Anti-Martial Movement, which later became the Anti-Martial Law Coalition (AMLC) in New York.

The AMLC set up its task force in Washington, D.C. to act as a watchdog on congressional action and to help coordinate mass pressure campaigns. It also developed policy positions and conducted patient work with congressional personnel to help sway options.

===Expansion===
Local formations of AMLC and anti-martial law alliances were developed in various cities to allow the participation of individuals who were not members of existing anti-martial law groups, such as the Movement for a Free Philippines (MFP) and the Friends of the Filipino People (FFP).

KDP leader and AMLC organizer Rene Ciria-Cruz wrote: AMLC launched well-coordinated campaigns, educating the community and non-Pilipino sectors on the plight of political prisoners, the U.S. motivation in supporting the regime, Marcos&#x27; maneuvers for legitimacy and more... These campaigns took the form of petition drives, demonstrators, Christmas caroling, speaking tours of exiled or deported oppositionists, and fund-raisers for the workers movement. The AMLC also sent human rights delegations to the Philippines, and during the rigged 1978 election, staged occupations of Philippine consulated in five cities.

==After Martial Law and Renaming==
In 1981, after the formal proclamation of martial law was lifted, AMLC became the Coalition Against the Marcos Dictatorship (CAMD), and had identifiably become an anti-imperialist organization. 

In 1983, CAMD merged with the Philippine Support Network to form CAMD/PSN, following a rift between former members of the Friends of the Filipino People (FFP). 

Regularized activities like annual protests on the anniversary of martial law, Christmas caroling, community forums, annual conferences, and mass distribution of the &quot;Taliba&quot; newsletter kept the controversy over martial law alive in the Filipino community and general public during periods of low political activity (“ebbs”) around the Philippines. All KDP activists, regardless of their principal area of work (e.g., anti-racist, cultural, national staff, etc.), participated in some aspect of the martial law work. The consistency of the activities paid off when developments began to heighten in the Philippines during the early 1980s, accelerated by the assassination of Senator Benign0 (Ninoy) Aquino in August 1983, and erupting into the “people’s revolution” three years later.

Known leaders included Maxi Villones, Odette Taverna, Christine Araneta, Greg Santillan, Ia Rodriguez, Armin Alforque, Dean Alegado, Fely Villasin, Liz Fenkell, Becky Villones, Lulu Ross, Pierre Thiry.

==Post-Marcos Era==
In 1986, the CAMD and the KDP joined with the MFP and the organizationally looser Ninoy Aquino Movement, as well as spontaneous local formations such as the Friends of Cory Aquino in a campaign to mobilize political and financial support for the presidential candidacy of Corazon Aquino, following her husband&#x27;s assassination.

CAMD/PSN was again re-named as the Committee to Advance the Movement for Democracy and Independence (CAMDI).

In 2016, former members of CAMD/PSN joined international gathering and protest rallies against the planned burial of Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani (Heroes’ Cemetery) in Fort Bonifacio, Metro Manila, Philippines.

<text>The Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts is one of the nine original dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.

==History==
Massachusetts was founded by Puritans who did not accept such aspects of the Church of England as bishops and the Book of Common Prayer. The first Anglican parish in the Massachusetts Bay Colony was King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston, founded in 1688, 58 years after the city. After the American Revolution, King&#x27;s Chapel became the first Unitarian congregation in North America. The oldest remaining parishes in the diocese are Christ Church in Quincy, founded in 1704, St. Paul&#x27;s in Newburyport, founded as Queen Anne&#x27;s Chapel in 1711, St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Marblehead, founded in 1714, Christ Church in Boston (Old North Church), founded in 1723, and St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in South Scituate (now Hanover), founded in 1727.

The diocese was organized in 1784, five years before the Episcopal Church itself. The first bishop (for New England and New York) was Samuel Seabury who was consecrated by the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784.

Today, it is one of the largest dioceses in the ECUSA in terms of membership. It encompasses the eastern part of Massachusetts, specifically, the nine counties east and southeast of Worcester County.

The diocese was the first in the Anglican Communion to consecrate a woman as a bishop. Barbara Harris became bishop suffragan of the diocese in 1989. It became the first diocese in the Episcopal Church to install an African American as diocesan bishop when John Melville Burgess was consecrated as the 12th bishop in 1970.

The current diocesan bishop is Alan M. Gates. He was consecrated bishop in 2014 and succeeded M. Thomas Shaw upon the latter&#x27;s retirement in September 2014. The current bishop suffragan is Carol Gallagher, consecrated in January 2003.

Historically, the diocese has been considered Low Church; however, there are a number of Anglo-Catholic parishes, the most notable of which is the Church of the Advent in Boston. Its best-known Low Church parish is Trinity Church in Boston&#x27;s Copley Square. However, Trinity and most other parishes in the diocese have become &#x27;higher&#x27; in the last 25 years with the introduction of Mass vestments such as the chasuble. Earlier distinctions between Low and High Church have largely disappeared across every diocese.

* The see city is Boston.
* Episcopal Divinity School was located in the diocese from its formation in 1974 until moving to New York City in 2017. Many of the diocese&#x27;s clergy are alumni of EDS.

The diocesan offices are located at 138 Tremont Street, adjacent to the Cathedral Church of St. Paul.

The diocese had 87,000 members in 2013 and had fallen to 82,450 by 2014.

<doc id="1268473" wikidata="Q7553789" url="?curid=1268473" title="Sofmap">
<text>is one of the largest personal computer and consumer electronics retailers in Japan. In 2000, it was the second largest e-commerce company in the country. Bic Camera acquired a majority stake in Sofmap in 2006, and turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary in January 2010. Formerly listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the code 2690, Sofmap was delisted on 26 January 2010 after the transaction was completed.

As of 2018, Sofmap has 29 stores in 21 districts, mainly in Tokyo and Akihabara.

==History==
Sofmap was established by in 1982 as a membership-based software rental business in Shinjuku, followed by branches in Kanda, Akihabara, and Shibuya, as well as franchise stores in Hiyoshi and Kawasaki in the Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1984, Sofmap expanded its business to new and used PC hardware, as well as Nintendo Family Computer and PC software sales. A year later, the software rental business was discontinued after it was declared illegal by the Japanese government.

At the beginning of their hardware sales, Sofmap specialized in &quot;box sales&quot;, where it set up shops at small-sized commercial buildings in Akihabara and Osaka/Nipponbashi and sold computers at low prices. In 1986, the company published a free publication titled , which listed computer products and prices. To differentiate themselves from other PC stores, Sofmap introduced their warranty system: five years for new computers and three years for used computers.

In anticipation of the PC boom that started with the release of Windows 95, Sofmap increased its floor space and focused on display sales for new PC users. However, during the mid-1990s, sales declined due to a combination of factors such as falling prices of personal computers, reduced distribution and profitability due to shortened product cycles of used products, and sluggish sales of home video games. In 1997, amidst rumors of the company filing for bankruptcy, Sofmap was purchased by Marubeni.

In 2000, Suzuki retired and was replaced by . The sofmap.com website was also established that year.

In 2005, Marubeni partially transferred its shares of Sofmap to Bic Camera, with Bic owning 61.56% of Sofmap by 2006. On January 29, 2010, Sofmap became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bic Camera. On March 1, 2012, the retail division was split and Sofmap Co., Ltd. was established, and the remaining store real estate management division was merged into Bic Camera. On June 5, 2017, Sofmap&#x27;s main Akihabara branch was converted into a Bic Camera branch while the rest of the Akihabara branches were rebranded as .

On October 31, 2019, Sofmap acquired anime shop from Bunkyodo Group Holdings.

<text>The British Empire Medal (BEM; formerly British Empire Medal for Meritorious Service) is a British and Commonwealth award for meritorious civil or military service worthy of recognition by the Crown. The current honour was created in 1922 to replace the original medal, which had been established in 1917 as part of the Order of the British Empire.

==Award==
The British Empire Medal is granted by the monarch of the United Kingdom in recognition of meritorious civil or military service. Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;BEM&quot; with special privileges to use St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral for funerals, baptisms and weddings. BEM holders can also apply for a family crest designed by the Monarch’s artist.

Since December 1918, the honour has been divided into civil and military divisions in a similar way to the Order of the British Empire itself. While recipients are not members of the Order, the medal is affiliated to it.

Between 1993 and 2012, the British Empire Medal was not awarded to citizens of the United Kingdom, although it continued to be awarded in some Commonwealth realms during that time. The practice of awarding the Medal to British citizens was resumed in June 2012, to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

Since March 1941 a clasp attached to the ribbon can be bestowed to denote a further award.

A holder of the BEM subsequently appointed to membership of the Order of the British Empire is permitted to wear the insignia for both.

==History==

===1917–1922===
The Medal of the Order of the British Empire was established in June 1917, along with the Order of the British Empire of which it was a part, and could be awarded for either meritorious service or for gallantry. It was awarded to 2,014 people, 800 of whom were from foreign countries.

===1922–1940===
In 1922, the original medal was discontinued, and was replaced by two separate honours, both of which still formed part of the Order of the British Empire. These two honours were known as the &quot;Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Meritorious Service&quot; (usually referred to as British Empire Medal, BEM) and the &quot;Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry&quot; (usually referred to as Empire Gallantry Medal, EGM). Of these medals, the EGM was awarded for acts of bravery, until it was replaced by the George Cross in 1940. The BEM was awarded in similar circumstances as the other Order of the British Empire medals. In the uniformed services, it was awarded to non-commissioned officers of the armed forces, officers below superintendent rank in the police,

===1940–1992===

On 24 September 1940, the George Cross was established, and the EGM was revoked by Royal Warrant the same day. All living recipients, other than honorary recipients, and the next-of-kin of those posthumously awarded the EGM after 3 September 1939, the start of the Second World War, were to exchange their insignia for the George Cross. Recipients of the BEM were not affected by these changes.

From 1940, the war led to an increasing number of BEMs awarded to service personnel and civilians, including the merchant marine, police and civil defence, for acts of gallantry that did not reach the standard of the George Medal (GM). Such awards often had citations, while awards for meritorious service usually did not.

From 14 January 1958, awards of the BEM for acts of gallantry were formally designated the British Empire Medal for Gallantry and consisted of the BEM with a silver oak leaf emblem worn on the ribbon. The first recipients of this newly designated award were two Board of Customs officers, George Elrick Thomson and John Rees Thomas, who ventured into a burning steamship hold in an attempt to rescue a colleague. Like the GM, the BEM for Gallantry could not be awarded posthumously and was eventually replaced in 1974 with the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal (QGM). Again, recipients of the BEM for services other than acts of bravery were not affected by these changes.

===1992–2012===
The BEM continued to be awarded to subjects of the United Kingdom until 1992. After a 1993 review of the British honours system, the government decided that the distinction between the BEM and MBE had &quot;become increasingly tenuous&quot; and the Prime Minister, John Major, ended the award of the BEM to British subjects, although the medal continued to be awarded in some Commonwealth realms, such as the Bahamas and the Cook Islands.

===From 2012===
Following the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the BEM would once again be awarded in the United Kingdom; this would start beginning in 2012, to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. In the 2012 Birthday Honours, released on 16 June 2012, the BEM was awarded to 293 people.

Although those awarded the honour do not receive it from the monarch in person, but from the Lord Lieutenant of their county, recipients are invited to a Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate their achievement.

===Appearance===
The Medal of the Order of the British Empire awarded from 1917 to 1922 was a circular silver medal, in diameter, showing a seated Britannia and the inscription on the obverse and the Royal cypher on the reverse. The medal had a ring suspender for the wide ribbon of plain purple, the military division having a red central stripe. The medal was awarded unnamed.

The medals introduced in 1922 broadly follow the same design but, with a diameter of , are larger than the previous medal, and have either or in the obverse exergue. The medal has a straight bar suspender for the wide ribbon. This was plain purple, with a red central stripe for the military division, until 1937 when, like the Order, the ribbon changed to the current design of rose-pink with pearl-grey edges, with an additional pearl-grey central stripe for the military division. The medal was presented with the recipient&#x27;s name on the rim.

<doc id="1268477" wikidata="Q1140163" url="?curid=1268477" title="Crisis? What Crisis?">
<text>Crisis? What Crisis? is the fourth album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in 1975. It was recorded in Los Angeles and London – Supertramp&#x27;s first album to have recording done in the US.

A remastered CD version of the album was released on 11 June 2002 on A&amp;M Records. The remaster features the original artwork and credits plus lyrics to all of the songs, which the original release lacked.

&quot;Record Mirror&quot; included &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; on its end-of-year list for 1975, recognising the best albums of the year.

==Background and recording==
Having achieved commercial success with &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (1974), the pressure was on for Supertramp to deliver a follow up, and the record company pushed them to begin work as soon as the touring for &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; was finished. While touring the west coast of North America, Supertramp unintentionally gained extra time: Hodgson injured his hand, forcing the band to cancel the rest of the tour and leaving them with nothing better to do than work on the album. Despite this, the band still had no time to rehearse for the album, and much like &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot; (1971), songwriters Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson had no vision for a completed album worked out. Furthermore, the band&#x27;s busy touring schedule had left no time for writing songs, and so they entered A&amp;M&#x27;s Los Angeles recording studios with only leftover songs from &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (or even earlier) for material. Due to shortage of material, production had to be halted at one point so that Davies and Hodgson could write two new songs, one of which was &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody But Me&quot;.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Nick DeRiso suggested that the melody of &quot;Sister Moonshine&quot; planted the seeds for Supertramp&#x27;s later song &quot;Give a Little Bit,&quot; which became one of their biggest hits.

Four of the songs (&quot;Sister Moonshine&quot;, &quot;Another Man&#x27;s Woman&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, and &quot;Just a Normal Day&quot;) were performed live before the tracks were recorded and released, as documented on the BBC recorded performance of the band playing at The Hammersmith Odeon in London in March 1975 and were included on the 2001 live release &quot;Is Everybody Listening?&quot;.

Hodgson was unhappy with the album, describing it as a rushed job with none of the cohesion of &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. Bassist Dougie Thomson concurred: &quot;We thought that the &quot;Crisis&quot; album was a little bit disjointed and the band as a whole at that time didn&#x27;t really like the album.&quot;

In the mid-1980s, however, Roger Hodgson called it his favourite Supertramp album.

==Artwork==
Both the title and the concept of the cover were conceived by Davies, as John Helliwell recounted: &quot;It was Rick that came up with the name &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; and one day, when we were sitting around Scorpio Studio, he came in with this sketch of a guy in a deck chair under an umbrella with all this chaos going on around him.&quot; It appears he was inspired by Yves Robert&#x27;s &quot;Alexandre le bienheureux&quot;. &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; is a line in the film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973). The phrase was used as a headline in The Sun newspaper during the Winter of Discontent in 1979 to convey a popular impression of the UK government at the time, attributed to then Prime Minister James Callaghan but denied by him. Hodgson stated that the title &quot;came to mean more to us as a title than it did to other people because it was really a crisis album. We learnt how not to make an album, coming right off the road and going into the studio. We really didn’t enjoy making it and in the end it was kind of a patch up job.&quot; Artist Paul Wakefield returned after his work in &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, photographing the backgrounds at the Welsh mining valleys, which were later composited with a model shot in the studio afterwards.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; panned the album in their brief review, ridiculing the lyrics in particular.

AllMusic commended the album in its retrospective review, praising Rick Davies&#x27;s keyboard work, Roger Hodgson&#x27;s vocals, and John Helliwell&#x27;s saxophone. They especially noted the emotionally powerful songwriting, which they felt gave the album a &quot;warm personality and charmingly subtle mood.&quot;

===Early life===

Zembic was born 1961 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

===The Breast bet===
In the summer of 1996, Zembic was gambling in a high-stakes game when the conversation turned to women&#x27;s breast implants. One of his friends, another gambler named Jobo, had the opinion that having implants in order to attract men was a crazy thing to do. Zembic disagreed and said that it was not a serious event and that the consequences were small. An argument ensued and the two agreed that they would enter into a wager where Zembic would receive breast implants and if he kept them in for a year he would win US$100,000 (US$ in 2025).

The two established a contract to work out the details. Zembic would pay for the operation to have 38C implants placed under his pec muscles. Jobo placed the money with a third party to guarantee payment if Zembic won the bet. For a few months in 1996 he didn&#x27;t follow through with the wager but in the fall of 1996 Zembic lost a large amount of money playing the stock market and sought out a surgeon to go through with the procedure in order to win the $100,000 prize to cover his losses.

Through his gambling contacts he found a cosmetic surgeon who was also a gambler and after a few games of backgammon Zembic was able to get the $4,500 surgery in exchange for forgiving the doctor&#x27;s debt. In October 1996, Zembic underwent the breast augmentation surgery in New York City. Jobo upon hearing that Zembic had undergone surgery offered to buy out the bet by paying $50,000 to cancel the wager but Zembic refused and said he would see the wager through for the full year and full $100,000. In October 1997, he fulfilled the arrangements of the bet and Jobo deposited the full $100,000 into a Swiss bank account.

After the one-year mark passed, he became a celebrity of sorts because of the wager. In 1999, his tale was the title feature in a book of short stories called &quot;The man with the $100,000 breasts and other gambling stories&quot;. Decades later, he still has the implants inside his chest, saying &quot;They&#x27;ll fall apart, sooner or later, or they might last. At my age, I don&#x27;t care.&quot;

===Other wagers===

Although Zembic is a notorious gambler, he claims the &#x27;breast bet&#x27; remains the most stupid he has ever accepted. He has taken part in other wagers, including one for $14,000 when he lived in a bathroom for a week before the people he took the bet with bought him out for $7,000. He once played famous poker player Doyle Brunson in a ping pong game where the winner, Zembic, took $14,000. On another bet he slept the night in New York&#x27;s Central Park with $20,000 on his person. He also lived in a box for a week to win another $25,000.

===Other work===

On March 25, 2005, Zembic played in the Season 2 of World Series of Blackjack where he lost to Jason Geraci, Michelle Richards, &quot;MIT Mike&quot; Aponte, and Eric Kiel (winner of a million dollar tournament) in round 9. Zembic is also a professional magician.

==Public appearances==

;The Man Show
He was seen by millions as the guy with the band-aids on his nipples on &quot;The Man Show&quot;. For this feat, the hosts paid Brian $100. On that show, he also recounted his experience living in a bathroom for a month in exchange for $15,000.

;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!
Zembic appeared on the popular Ripley&#x27;s TV show in 2001.

;Botched (TV series)
Zembic appeared on Season 3, Episode 2, &quot;Man Boobs,&quot; aired 2016-05-17, describing his personal history involving his breast implants and consulting with Drs. Dubrow and Nassif on the health concerns involving retaining or removing them.

==In popular media==

===Book===

===Untitled movie===
In a 2005 interview, Zembic stated that starting in 1999, there was a movie in the works about his story. Fox Searchlight Pictures bought the rights to his story. The script has been completed and various stars have been attached like Drew Carey and David Duchovny. Zembic says part of the reason he hasn&#x27;t had the implants removed is that &quot;... every year when they renewed the rights, they kept saying, &#x27;Keep the tits so you can appear at the end of the movie. It&#x27;ll be really cool.&#x27;&quot; But David Higgins the producer attached to the film says, &quot;I&#x27;m not insisting that he keep his implants in; it&#x27;s completely up to him,&quot; he says. &quot;It would be great for marketing, of course, but we can always find another way.&quot;

==Family==

In 2000, Zembic fathered a daughter, Mika with his then-wife. When asked about her father&#x27;s mammaries Mika said, &quot;I know why you have boobs: Uncle Mike paid you money to put them in.&quot; In a 2006 interview, he said that Mika was one of the few reasons he would have the implants taken out: if they caused her to be bullied in school, he would have them removed.

<text>The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology is a unit of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign dedicated to interdisciplinary research. A gift from scientist, businessman, and philanthropist Arnold O. Beckman (1900–2004) and his wife Mabel (1900–1989) led to the building of the Institute which opened in 1989. It is one of five institutions which receive support from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation on an ongoing basis. Current research at Beckman involves the areas of molecular engineering, intelligent systems, and imaging science. Researchers in these areas work across traditional academic boundaries in scientific projects that can lead to the development of real-world applications in medicine, industry, electronics, and human health across the lifespan.

== History ==
The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology has its origins in a 1983 meeting in which chancellor John E. Cribbet, Theodore L. Brown, Mort Weir, Lewis Barron and Ned Goldwasser strategized about approaching private sources to fund new large-scale science projects and centers on the University of Illinois campus. Two committees were formed, chaired by William T. Greenough (psychology) and Greg Stillman (electrical and computer engineering) (later Karl Hess) to develop ideas for a broadly multidisciplinary research facility. Thomas Eugene Everhart, who succeeded Cribbet as chancellor in 1984, and Sarah Wasserman, assistant vice-chancellor for research, helped Brown and Weir to review and develop the final proposal. The committee reports were combined to propose an institute with two main divisions, a center for biology, behavior, and cognition, and another center for materials science, computers and computation. The institution&#x27;s research program would explore intelligence in the broadest possible sense, extending &quot;from artificial systems invented by man to natural systems found in the biological world&quot;.

Arnold Beckman was approached with the proposal by university president Stanley lkenberry, Lew Barron, and Mort Weir. Beckman estimated that the proposal would require the unprecedented sum of $50 million. On October 5, 1985, the university officially announced that Arnold and Mabel Beckman had made the largest donation ever given to a public university at that time – $40M, with a $10M supplement from the state of Illinois – to build a research center at Illinois that would encourage scientists and engineers from different disciplines to work together. By December 10, 1985, the university had chosen the architectural firm of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls (SH&amp;G) (now SmithGroup) and architectural designer Ralph Youngren for the project. A symbolic ground-breaking ceremony took place October 10, 1986. Theodore L. Brown, who had been actively involved in the project as vice chancellor for research and graduate dean, became the first director of the institute as of March 12, 1987. William T. Greenough and Karl Hess became associate directors, with half-time appointments, in the fall of 1987.

By December 1988, the building was sufficiently advanced that faculty groups could begin to move in. Administrative offices were temporarily located in the basement. An official inauguration ceremony was held on April 7, 1989, to open the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology as one of the first research centers in the world dedicated to interdisciplinary research. Theodore L. Brown was succeeded as director in the summer of 1993 by chemist Jiri Jonas. Jiri Jonas was the Beckman Institute Director from 1993 to 2001; he was succeeded by Pierre Wiltzius, Beckman Institute Director from 2001 to 2008; Tamer Başar, Interim Director from 2008 to 2009; Arthur F. Kramer, Director from 2010 to 2016; Jeffrey S. Moore, Director from 2016 to 2022; and Nadya Mason, Director from 2022-2023. Catherine J. Murphy was interim Director from 2023-2024, and Stephen Maren was named Director in July 2024.

According to the 2022–2023 Annual Report of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, about 200 faculty members, 500 graduate students, 325 undergraduate students, 80 postdocs and 150 staff members conduct research or work at the Beckman Institute.

== Research ==
Scientific exploration at the Beckman Institute is centered around three broad research themes: Intelligent Systems, Integrative Imaging, and Molecular Science and Engineering.

The Intelligent Systems research theme (IntelSys) is a merging of two older themes (Biological Intelligence and Human-Computer Intelligent Interaction). The theme is comprehensive in scope, as researchers seek to understand the brain, cognition, and behavior from the molecular and cellular levels to higher cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision making. It also includes technology research such as computer vision, event-related optical signal and speech recognition.

The Integrative Imaging (IntIm) research theme is geared toward the interdisciplinary discovery of fundamental principles in imaging science, and developing new technologies for the next generation of imaging instruments and novel techniques for basic and translational research. Many researchers in the IntIm theme are working on biomedical applications, using ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, biophotonics, or medical optical imaging.

The Molecular Science and Engineering (MSE) research theme brings together scientists from biology, engineering, physics and chemistry, to study molecular structures and processes. The MSE research portfolio includes molecular engineering, self-healing materials, and computational biophysics (such as NAMD).

== Beckman Fellowships ==

The Beckman Institute offers a variety of fellowship programs, which enable researchers to work for short periods of time at the Institute. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellowships are awarded to Beckman scholars who receive 3-year appointments, including both a stipend and a research budget. The first Beckman postdoctoral scholars were Efrat Shimshoni (condensed matter physics) and Andrew Nobel (information theory and statistics). Beckman Graduate Fellowships are awarded to students who are working at the master&#x27;s or doctorate level. Beckman Senior Fellowships are awarded to senior faculty from other institutions.

Beckman Fellowships administered through the Beckman Institute should not be confused with those administered through the Center for Advanced Study (CAS) at the University of Urbana-Champaign. The CAS awards a series of Beckman Fellowships and Beckman Research Awards which support faculty at Urbana-Champaign in their research activities. These awards were funded through an endowment from Arnold and Mabel Beckman, given in the late 1970s, prior to the establishment of the Beckman Institute. They are administered separately and are awarded throughout the university, not just within the sciences.

== Research services ==
The Beckman Institute hosts two major core research facilities. The Biomedical Imaging Center (BIC) includes the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory, the Molecular Imaging Laboratory, and the Ultrasound Imaging Laboratory. The Imaging Technology Group includes the Microscopy Suite and the Visualization Laboratory.

== Beckman Institute Open House ==
The Beckman Institute Open House is an annual event held in conjunction with UIUC Engineering Open House.

<text>The Florianturm (Florian Tower, &quot;Florian&quot; for short) is a telecommunications tower and landmark of Dortmund (Germany). It is named after St. Florian, the patron saint of gardeners.

The Florianturm is the TV tower of Dortmund and was built in 1959 as an attraction for a federal horticultural show with a height of . At the time it was briefly the highest freestanding structure in Germany.

The tower was constructed similarly to a high concrete chimney. It consists of a reinforced concrete tube, which tapers off as it rises, reaching a height of . At there is a building part with two floors. On the lower floor there are operation rooms and on the upper floor at there is a revolving restaurant. At and there are two observation decks.

On the upper observation deck there are installations and aerials of &quot;Deutsche Telekom&quot;. Since 1959 it has been used for transmitting television signals. 

On 7 September 2004, a Russian helicopter was used to replace the aerial. Since then, a 50-kilowatt transmitter has transmitted digital terrestrial television programmes for the Dortmund area.

Since 7 September 2004, the Florianturm has a height of , making it the fourteenth highest structure in Germany.

From 1996 to 1998, the tower was renovated and safety standards were brought up to date.

In 2000, a catwalk for bungee jumping was opened on the upper platform. It was closed in 2003 after a fatal accident and was removed in July 2008.

<doc id="1268487" wikidata="Q2197488" url="?curid=1268487" title="Sonic Labyrinth">
<text>is an action-puzzle video game developed by Minato Giken and published by Sega for the Game Gear in 1995. The game features Sonic the Hedgehog exploring maze-like stages from an isometric perspective. Dr. Robotnik has robbed Sonic of his trademark speed, so Sonic walks slowly but can roll into a ball and dash across the stages.

Upon release, critical reception to the game was mixed: many critics found the game a unique addition to the &quot;Sonic&quot; library but flawed by convoluted controls and repetitive gameplay. In retrospect, however, it has received generally negative reviews and is considered among the worst &quot;Sonic&quot; games ever released. Despite this, the game has been re-released multiple times in the following years.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; is an action and puzzle game with pinball elements. It is presented in an isometric perspective, and has been compared to &quot;Marble Madness&quot;. Series villain Dr. Robotnik has tricked Sonic the Hedgehog into wearing special shoes designed to rob him of his speed, so Sonic must collect the Chaos Emeralds to release the shoes from his feet.

The player controls Sonic, navigating him through maze-like stages filled with enemies and obstacles that hinder his path. Sonic walks uncharacteristically slowly, but can roll into a ball and dash across the levels to take out enemies and avoid danger. This spin dash move can be charged for extra speed and damage. Sonic must collect three keys in each stage and bring them to the goal to advance to the next level. Sometimes the keys may be hidden within enemies. The game has four zones, each containing three stages. After each set of three stages, there is a bonus round of collecting rings and a boss battle. Collecting 100 rings in the bonus round will net the player an extra life. A time attack mode is also available.

==Development and release==
&quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; was developed by Minato Giken, and published by Sega. It was released in Japan on 17 November 1995, in North America that November, and in Europe around October or November. The game was included in &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; (2003) as an unlockable bonus, and in the compilation &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; (2004). It was rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS on the Japanese eShop digital distribution platform on 16 May 2012. It was later released in Europe on 10 May 2012, and in North America on 17 June 2013. The North American release came as part of a campaign by Nintendo to release 8-bit games on the 3DS eShop following a drought of releases on the distribution service. The game does not take advantage of the system&#x27;s 3D stereoscopic functionality.

==Reception==

Critical reception to &quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; was mixed. Multiple reviewers wrote about difficulties controlling Sonic as he bounced wildly around the levels. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; wrote that &quot;you can get through each level with a bit of practise but you&#x27;re left wondering how you did it.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) did not like the game&#x27;s isometric perspective, thinking it contributed to problems directing Sonic around. &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote that small screen made it occasionally difficult to see what was occurring. They did like the graphics however, as did &quot;EGM&quot; and &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot;, the latter which thought they echoed the graphics of &quot;SegaSonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1993).

Reflecting their positive thoughts, &quot;Mega Fun&quot; thought &quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; featured innovative gameplay. &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Famitsu&quot; both compared the game to &quot;Marble Madness&quot;. &quot;Sega Magazin&quot; thought the game was challenging with sophisticated level design. &quot;GamePro&quot; believed it was the most interesting of the recent &quot;Sonic&quot; additions to the Game Gear library. One reviewer at &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; thought it was a good puzzle game to play in short segments, and may be worth the time for fans of &quot;Sonic&quot; games, pinball, or puzzles. However another critic from the same magazine thought the game was frustrating and repetitive. &quot;EGM&quot; also thought the game became repetitious after a few levels and would be boring for more experienced players, although &quot;Sonic&quot; fans may enjoy it. They concluded their thoughts writing: &quot;This title overall tried to mix the standard side-scrolling &quot;Sonic&quot; game with a worthless pinball title and failed. In turn, this one just comes up short in both playability and enjoyment, causing boredom after the first few stages.&quot;

Retrospectively, reception has been negative and is frequently described as one of the worst &quot;Sonic&quot; games. In a retrospective review, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the game a &quot;poor&quot; 4 out of 10 score. They criticized the controls and illogical level design, and the start-stop nature of the gameplay. They also wrote about Sonic&#x27;s lack of speed when walking on foot, which they thought was baffling for a &quot;Sonic&quot; game. &quot;USgamer&quot; called it &quot;a poor man&#x27;s version of &quot;Marble Madness&quot;, taking the worst of that game and the worst of &quot;Sonic&quot; and cramming it into one title. Absolutely dire.&quot; &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; called it &quot;a demented version of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;&quot;, drawing similarities through its isometric style. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called it &quot;a dreadful game with an identity crisis&quot; and &quot;one of the worst &quot;Sonic&quot; games ever&quot;.

<text>Arroz a la cubana () (&quot;Cuban-style rice&quot;) or arroz cubano is a rice dish popular in Spain, the Philippines, and parts of Latin America. Its defining ingredients are rice and a fried egg. A fried banana (plantain or other cooking bananas) and tomato sauce (&quot;sofrito&quot;) are so frequently used that they are often considered defining ingredients too. 

Despite the name, the dish does not exist in Cuban cuisine and its origins are not definitively known. It may possibly originate from a Spanish misinterpretation of common Cuban meals of eating rice with stews and a fried egg when Cuba was still a Spanish colony. 

==By region==
===Spain===
In Spain, a typical dish of &quot;arroz a la cubana&quot; consists of a serving of white rice (which is sometimes shaped into small mounds using a glass), tomato sauce (&quot;sofrito&quot;) and a fried egg. While the most traditional recipe includes a fried plantain (&quot;plátano)&quot;, it is also common to find the recipe using sausages and bacon. It is typical to cut and mix all the ingredients before eating, allowing the yolk of the egg to melt and combine everything well.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, &quot;arroz a la cubana&quot; has been eaten in the Philippines since Spanish colonial times. Like in other versions, it comes with white rice, fried egg, and some ripe fried cardava or saba banana, sliced length-wise.

It differs significantly from the Spanish and Latin American versions in that instead of a &quot;sofrito&quot;, it always includes ground meat (&quot;giniling&quot;, usually beef) in tomato sauce. This component is typically cooked &quot;picadillo&quot;-style, with minced potatoes, carrots, raisins, peas, onions, garlic, and other ingredients in a tomato-based sauce seasoned with &quot;patis&quot; (fish sauce), soy sauce, and sometimes chilis.

A regional variant of &quot;arroz a la cubana&quot; is &quot;arroz de Calamba&quot; from Calamba, Laguna. It differs in that it is served with strips of smoked fish (&quot;tinapa&quot;).

===Peru===
In Peru, it is common for the dish to consist of white rice, fried plantain, a fried hot-dog wiener, and a fried egg over the white rice.

<doc id="1268495" wikidata="Q13197" url="?curid=1268495" title="Ratagnon language">
<text>Ratagnon (also translated as Latagnon or Datagnon, and Aradigi) is a regional language spoken by the Ratagnon people, an indigenous group from Occidental Mindoro. It is a part of the Bisayan language family and is closely related to other Philippine languages. Its speakers are shifting to Tagalog. In 2000, there were only two to five speakers of the language. However, in 2010 &quot;Ethnologue&quot; had reported there were 310 new speakers.

==Classification==
Ratagnon is closely related to the Cuyonon language, a Bisayan language spoken in the Cuyo Archipelago just to the south of Mindoro.

This may be brought about by migrations of Cuyonons to the southern tip of Mindoro, akin to their migrations to mainland Palawan, a very much gradual process. It could be inferred that these migrations happened at an earlier date before the migrations to mainland Palawan started (around the mid- to late 19th century) due to its diversion from the Cuyonon language (Given that Ratagnon descended from an older language spoken in the general area West of Panay, Ratagnon and Cuyonon are classified under Kuyan), whereas the Cuyonon of mainland Palawan, Calamian and that of the Cuyo itself remain the same language with relatively little dialectal difference.

==Distribution==
According to the &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, Ratagnon is spoken in the southernmost extreme tip of Mindoro islands, including the municipalities of Magsaysay and Bulalacao.
*Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro
*Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro

 lists the following locations.
*lower Caguray River near Santa Teresa, Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro
*San Nicolas, Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro
*Bamban, Magsaysay, Occidental Mindoro

==Vocabulary==
Barbian (1977) provides lexical and phonological data for Ratagnon.

In contrast to Cuyonon, Ratagnon dropped the schwa sound, instead opting for a &quot;u/o&quot; sound. It too borrowed lexical terms from the languages of its Mangyan neighbors and to a lesser extent Spanish It is notable in Barbian&#x27;s &quot;Mangyan – English Vocabulary&quot;, Ratagnon might have already experienced heavy Tagalization, present in words such as &#x27;heart&#x27;, in Cuyonon, albeit in Ratagnon, same with Tagalog&#x27;s . The word &#x27;why&#x27;, in Cuyonon, is noted as and in Ratagnon, ( + ) being a loan from Tagalog, and , a Hanunuo Ambahan term ( being non-Ambahan), perhaps inferring that is a loan from Ratagnon, as Ambahans have been known to use archaic Hanunuo terms and loans from various languages, one being Ratagnon. This phenomenon is also observed in the Hanunuo traditions of Urukay, perhaps closely related to the Erekay of the Cuyonons, both being a form of Balagtasan. Ratagnon also has terms specific to the lowland river surroundings which are not present in modern Cuyonon, most of which are borrowings from Hanunuo and Buhid, whereas a few are either archaic Cuyonon terms or innovations made within the Ratagnon language. Aside from the aforementioned differences from the Cuyonon language, the two languages are still very much mutually intelligible.

Differences from Cuyonon include:

The usage of the &quot;t&quot; sound over the &quot;d&quot; sound, present in:
Usage of the &quot;k&quot; sound over the &quot;g&quot; sound:

The aforementioned dropping of the schwa for the &quot;u&quot; sound present in:

The preference for the &quot;l&quot; over the &quot;r&quot; sound:

There are some words that differ in meaning between Cuyonon and Ratagnon; this is most notable in terms specific to their respective surroundings, which has created false friends with almost the same, yet different, meanings.

<text>Neurophenomenology refers to a scientific research program aimed to address the hard problem of consciousness in a pragmatic way. It combines neuroscience with phenomenology in order to study experience, mind, and consciousness with an emphasis on the embodied condition of the human mind. The field is very much linked to fields such as neuropsychology, neuroanthropology and behavioral neuroscience (also known as biopsychology) and the study of phenomenology in psychology.

==Overview==
The label was coined by C. Laughlin, J. McManus and E. d&#x27;Aquili in 1990. However, the term was appropriated and given a distinctive understanding by the cognitive neuroscientist Francisco Varela in the mid-1990s, whose work has inspired many philosophers and neuroscientists to continue with this new direction of research.

Phenomenology is a philosophical method of inquiry of everyday experience. The focus in phenomenology is on the examination of different phenomena (from Greek, &quot;phainomenon&quot;, &quot;that which shows itself&quot;) &quot;as they appear to consciousness&quot;, i.e. in a first-person perspective. Thus, phenomenology is a discipline particularly useful for understanding how it is that appearances present themselves to us and how it is that we attribute meaning to them.

Neuroscience is the scientific study of the brain, and deals with the third-person aspects of consciousness. Some scientists studying consciousness believe that the exclusive utilization of either first- or third-person methods will not provide answers to the difficult questions of consciousness.

Historically, Edmund Husserl is regarded as the philosopher whose work made phenomenology a coherent philosophical discipline with a concrete methodology in the study of consciousness, namely the epoche. Husserl, who was a former student of Franz Brentano, thought that in the study of mind it was extremely important to acknowledge that consciousness is characterized by intentionality, a concept often explained as &quot;aboutness&quot;; consciousness is always consciousness &quot;of&quot; something. A particular emphasis on the phenomenology of embodiment was developed by philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty in the mid-20th century.

Naturally, phenomenology and neuroscience find a convergence of common interests. However, primarily because of ontological disagreements between phenomenology and philosophy of mind, the dialogue between these two disciplines is still a very controversial subject. Husserl himself was very critical towards any attempt to &quot;naturalizing&quot; philosophy, and his phenomenology was founded upon a criticism of empiricism, &quot;psychologism&quot;, and &quot;anthropologism&quot; as contradictory standpoints in philosophy and logic. The influential critique of the ontological assumptions of computationalist and representationalist cognitive science, as well as artificial intelligence, made by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus has marked new directions for integration of neurosciences with an embodied ontology. The work of Dreyfus has influenced cognitive scientists and neuroscientists to study phenomenology and embodied cognitive science and/or enactivism. One such case is neuroscientist Walter Freeman, whose neurodynamical analysis has a marked Merleau-Pontyian approach.

<doc id="1268502" wikidata="Q7539196" url="?curid=1268502" title="Slave patrol">
<text>Slave patrols—also known as patrollers, patterrollers, pattyrollers, or paddy rollers—were organized groups of armed men who monitored and enforced discipline upon slaves in the antebellum U.S. southern states. The slave patrols&#x27; function was to police slaves, especially those who escaped or were viewed as defiant. They also formed river patrols to prevent escape by boat.

Slave patrols were first established in South Carolina in 1704 and the idea spread throughout the colonies before their use ended following the Civil War.

==Formation of slave patrols==
Slave patrols first began in South Carolina in 1704 and spread throughout the thirteen colonies, lasting well beyond the American Revolution. As colonists enslaved more Africans and the population of enslaved people in South Carolina grew, especially with the invention of the cotton gin, so did the fear of slave uprisings. They developed slave patrols when other means of slave control failed to quell enslaved people&#x27;s resistance. Their biggest concern was how to keep enslaved people on the plantations being held against their will, since that is where enslaved populations were highest. Initially, slave owners offered incentives to the non slave owning whites, such as tobacco and money, to urge them to be more vigilant in the capture of runaway slaves. When this approach failed, slave patrols were formally established. Legislators introduced laws that enlisted white people in the regulation of enslaved people&#x27;s activities and movement. Black people were subjected to questioning, searches, and other harassment. Slaves who were encountered without passes from their white &quot;master&quot; were expected to be returned to their owners, as stated in the slave code. If caught by patrols and returned to their masters, punishments included whippings and other physical violence, and the threat of being placed on the auction block and sold away from their families, an option for masters who no longer wanted to deal with &quot;non-compliant&quot; slaves.

==State militias as patrollers==
Slave owners feared gatherings held by enslaved people would allow them to trade or steal goods, and had the potential for organizing a revolt or rebellion. South Carolina and Virginia selected patrols from state militias. State militia groups were also organized from among the cadets of the Southern military academies, of The Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute, which were founded to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols and to detect, encounter, and crush any organized slave meetings that might lead to revolt or rebellion.

==Slave codes and fugitive slave laws==
The Fugitive Slave Laws helped enforce the necessity for slave patrols to abide by the law. Although these laws were initially created to keep tensions low between the north and the south, it caused the physical formation of slave patrols. During the Civil War, the theory of Contraband prevented the return of Southern slaves who reached Union-held territory. This helped limit the role of slave patrols/catchers and changed the war. Another form of help for slaves was the Underground Railroad, which aided slaves in their escape to Northern states. Outside of the Underground Railroad, enslaved Black people went further south to ensure their freedom. Black people also formed their own organized networks and means of escape from slavery to Florida, where Black people negotiated with Native Americans and the Spanish government, and were able to live self-determined and free lives. Formerly enslaved people formed their own towns, military, and merged with the Florida population as Seminoles. Formerly imprisoned Europeans, Irish immigrants, and other former institutionalized Europeans were immigrated through race-based policies to found the state of Georgia. They were partially recruited to form a buffer state to stop enslaved Black people from escaping from the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia to Florida. Slave patrols in Georgia were formed for this purpose. Free Black cities and armed and trained Black militaries in Florida were a direct challenge to White dominance and profits in slave-owning states. The concept of self-determined freedom was also a direct challenge to the concept that Whites should rule and to the institution of slavery. Slave patrols and plantation police were organized by Whites as legal and extra-legal means to stop this from occurring.

The use and physical formation of slave patrols came to its end in 1865 when the Civil War ended. This end, however, is linked to post-Civil War groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, which continued to terrorize and threaten the black community.
In South Carolina, colonists began to write laws that constricted slaves long before slave patrols were alive and well. Laws implemented set in motion curfews for slaves, strengthening their militia, preventing slaves from bartering goods, and establishing the Charleston town watch. These are examples of some of the laws and ideas that molded what we know as slave codes.

==Patrollers&#x27; duties==
Slave patrollers had their own characteristics, duties, and benefits, apart from slave owners and overseers. Patrollers were often equipped with guns and whips and would exert force in order to bring slaves back to their owners.

At times, black people developed many methods of challenging slave patrolling, occasionally fighting back violently. The American Civil War developed more opportunities for resistance against slave patrols and made it easier for enslaved people to escape. Slave patrol duties started as breaking up slave meetings.

Slave meetings included religious ones. Laws were passed, particularly around the 1820&#x27;s and 1830&#x27;s, that made religious gatherings of slaves and free blacks &quot;unlawful assemblies.&quot; For example, Virginia passed a law in 1819 that banned any nighttime meetings of free blacks and slaves. South Carolina&#x27;s law, by 1840, banned meetings at night for &quot;mental instruction or religious worship,&quot; whether whites were present or not. In 1831, Mississippi made it unlawful for free blacks or slaves to &quot;preach the gospel.&quot;

These slave meetings occurred on holidays, in which they would plan revolts and uprisings. Eventually, slave patrols expanded to be year-round, not just on holidays. Slowly, new duties and rights of patrollers became permitted, including: &quot;apprehending runaways, monitoring the rigid pass requirements for Blacks traversing the countryside, breaking up large gatherings and assemblies of blacks, visiting and searching slave quarters randomly, inflicting impromptu punishments, and as occasion arose, suppressing insurrections.&quot;

Slave patrols consisted mostly of white citizens. Most people in slave patrols came from working and middle-class conditions. In some southern states, the militia and army served as slave patrols. In other southern states, slave patrols came about from colonial or state government legislation. Slave patrols typically rode on horseback in groups of four or five, sometimes even in family groups. They often worked sun-up to sun-down and varied their times and locations of patrol, to lower the chances of slaves escaping. They used no special equipment. Their chief tools, instead, were whips and intimidation..

Some states required every white man to arrest and chastise any slave found away from his home without proper authorization. In colonial South Carolina, failure to do so incurred a fine of forty shillings. Recaptured slaves were returned to their masters. In some instances, white men encouraged slaves to escape in order to collect rewards for catching them. In some areas, killing a slave was not considered a crime by the courts or community.

Slave patrollers were compensated in several ways, including exemption from public, county, and parish taxes and fees during their terms of service. In addition, some patrollers were paid additional sums with surplus money.

Also, regardless of the power patrollers held, they had limitations. For example, although whippings and beatings were permitted, a deterrent also existed. This was that, if whipped or beaten too severely, the slave was then of no use to their masters as laborers the next day. As a consequence, overly-brutal patrollers could expect retaliation from slave owners.

==Diminishing use of slave patrols==

===American Civil War===
The Civil War, which lasted four years, directly threatened the very existence of slavery and, in turn, slave patrols. The first year after the Civil War began, slave patrols increased. Confederates were expecting slave revolts, which inspired them to appoint more patrols. As the war dragged on, more and more White men were being called upon to serve in the Confederate army. White men who would have served in slave patrols had they remained in their communities, went to serve in the Confederate army. Some young men who were turned away by the army, mostly for medical reasons, ended up taking places within the slave patrols. As slave owners entered the Confederate army, some slaves lost the shield they once had to protect them from the harsh and brutal beatings.

After the Emancipation Proclamation, the increasing number of White men being called to the militias of the South in 1862 and 1863 resulted in many slave patrols simply not having enough men to be as active as they once were. As the Union army moved into local areas and communities, the likelihood that enslaved people that could flee to the areas controlled by the Union increased. Slaves who were considered obedient started to disappear in the night, running toward the Union army to emancipate themselves.

===Reconstruction===
With the war lost, Southern Whites&#x27; fears of African Americans increased in 1865 due to Reconstruction governments that were perceived as oppressive to the South. Even though slavery and patrols were legally ended, the patrol system still survived. Almost immediately in the aftermath of the war, informal patrols sprang into action. Later, city and rural police squads, along with the help of Union army officers, revived patrolling practices among free men. During the post-Civil War Reconstruction period of 1865–1877, old-style patrol methods resurfaced and were enforced by postwar Southern police officers and also by organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.

<doc id="1268506" wikidata="Q844172" url="?curid=1268506" title="Japanese Paleolithic">
<text>The is the period of human inhabitation in Japan predating the development of pottery, generally before 10,000 BC. The starting dates commonly given to this period are from around 40,000 BC, with recent authors suggesting that there is good evidence for habitation from c. 36,000 BC onwards. The period extended to the beginning of the Mesolithic Jōmon period, or around 14,000 BC.

==Archaeology of the Paleolithic period==
The study of the Paleolithic period in Japan did not begin until quite recently: the first Paleolithic site was not discovered until 1946, right after the end of World War II. Due to the previous assumption that humans did not live in Japan before the Jōmon period, excavations usually stopped at the beginning of the Jōmon stratum (14,000 BC), and were not carried on further. However, since that first Paleolithic find by Tadahiro Aizawa, around 5,000 Paleolithic sites have been discovered, some of them at existing Jōmon archaeological sites, and some dating to the Pleistocene era. Sites have been discovered from southern Kyushu to northern Hokkaido, but most are small and only stone tools have been preserved due to the high acidity of the Japanese soil. As the Paleolithic peoples probably occupied the wide coastal shelves exposed by lower sea levels during the Pleistocene, the majority of sites are most likely inundated.

The study of the Japanese Paleolithic period is characterized by a high level of stratigraphic information due to the volcanic nature of the archipelago: large eruptions tend to cover the islands with levels of Volcanic ash, which are easily datable and can be found throughout the country as a reference. A very important such layer is the AT (Aira-Tanzawa) pumice, which covered all Japan around 21,000–22,000 years ago.

In 2000, the reputation of Japanese archaeology of the Paleolithic was heavily damaged by a scandal, which has become known as the Japanese Paleolithic hoax. The Mainichi Shimbun reported the photos in which Shinichi Fujimura, an amateur archaeologist in Miyagi Prefecture, had been planting artifacts at the &quot;Kamitakamori site&quot;, where he &quot;found&quot; the artifacts the next day. He admitted the fabrication in an interview with the newspaper. The Japanese Archaeological Association disaffiliated Fujimura from its members. A special investigation team of the Association revealed that almost all the artifacts which he had found were his fabrication.

Since the discovery of the hoax, only a few sites can tentatively date human activity in Japan to 40,000–50,000 BC, and the first widely accepted date of human presence on the archipelago can be reliably dated . One of the most important sites dating to these times is Lake Nojiri, which dates to 37,900 years Before Present (~36,000 BC), which shows evidence of butchery of two of the largest extinct megafauna species native to Japan, the elephant &quot;Palaeoloxodon naumanni&quot;, and the giant deer &quot;Sinomegaceros yabei&quot;.

==Ground stone and polished tools==
The Japanese Paleolithic is unique in that it incorporates one of the earliest known sets of ground stone and polished stone tools in the world, although older ground stone tools have been discovered in Australia. The tools, which have been dated to around 30,000 BC, are a technology associated in the rest of the world with the beginning of the Neolithic around 10,000 BC. It is not known why such tools were created so early in Japan.

Because of this originality, the Japanese Paleolithic period in Japan does not exactly match the traditional definition of Paleolithic based on stone technology (chipped stone tools). Japanese Paleolithic tool implements thus display Mesolithic and Neolithic traits as early as 30,000 BC.

==Paleoanthropology==
The Paleolithic populations of Japan, as well as the later Jōmon populations, appear to relate to an ancient Paleo-Asian group which occupied large parts of Asia before the expansion of the populations characteristic of today&#x27;s people of China, Korea, and Japan.

During much of this period, Japan was connected to the Asian continent by land bridges due to lower sea levels. Skeletal characteristics point to many similarities with other aboriginal people of the Asian continent. Dental structures are distinct but generally closer to the Sundadont than to the Sinodont group, which points to an origin among groups in Southeast Asia or the islands south of the mainland. Skull features tend to be stronger, with comparatively recessed eyes. According to “&quot;Jōmon culture and the peopling of the Japanese archipelago&quot;” by Schmidt and Seguchi, the prehistoric Jōmon people descended from a paleolithic populations of Siberia (in the area of the Altai Mountains). Other cited scholars point out similarities between the Jōmon and various paleolithic and Bronze Age Siberians. There were likely multiple migrations into ancient Japan.

According to Mitsuru Sakitani, the Jōmon people were an admixture of two distinct ethnic groups: A more ancient group (carriers of Y chromosome D1a) that were present in Japan since more than 30,000 years ago and a more recent group (carriers of Y chromosome C1a) that migrated to Japan about 13,000 years ago (Jomon).

Genetic analysis on today&#x27;s populations is not clear-cut and tends to indicate a fair amount of genetic intermixing between the earliest populations of Japan and later arrivals (Cavalli-Sforza). It is estimated that modern Japanese have about 10% Jōmon ancestry.

Jōmon people were found to have been very heterogeneous. Jōmon samples from the Ōdai Yamamoto I Site differ from Jōmon samples of Hokkaido and geographically close eastern Honshu. Ōdai Yamamoto Jōmon were found to have C1a1 and are genetically close to ancient and modern Northeast Asian groups but noteworthy different to other Jōmon samples such as Ikawazu or Urawa Jōmon. Similarly, the Nagano Jōmon from the Yugora cave site are closely related to contemporary East Asians but genetically different from the Ainu people, who are direct descendants of the Hokkaido Jōmon.

One study, published in the Cambridge University Press in 2020, suggests that the Jōmon people were rather heterogeneous, and that many Jōmon groups were descended from an ancient &quot;Altaic-like&quot; population (close to modern Tungusic-speakers, represented by Oroqen), which established itself over the local hunter gatherers. This “Altaic-like” population migrated from Northeast Asia in about 6,000 BC, and coexisted with other unrelated tribes and or intermixed with them, before being replaced by the later Yayoi people. C1a1 and C2 are linked to the &quot;Tungusic-like people&quot;, which arrived in the Jōmon period archipelago from Northeast Asia in about 6,000 BC and introduced the Incipient Jōmon culture, typified by early ceramic cultures such as the Ōdai Yamamoto I Site.

<text>Ratagnon (also transliterated Datagnon or Latagnon) is one of the eight indigenous groups of Mangyan in the southernmost tip of Occidental Mindoro and the Mindoro Islands along the Sulu Sea, in the Philippines. The Ratagnon live in the southernmost part of the municipality of Magsaysay in Occidental Mindoro. Their language is similar to the Visayan Cuyunon language, spoken by the inhabitants of Cuyo Island in Northern Palawan.

The Ratagnon women wear a wrap-around cotton cloth from the waistline to the knees and some of the males still wear the traditional loincloth. The women&#x27;s breast covering is made of woven nito (vine). They also wear accessories made of beads and copper wire. The males wear a jacket with simple embroidery during gala festivities and carry flint, tinder, and other paraphernalia for making fire. Both sexes wear coils of red-dyed rattan at the waistline. Like many of their native Mangyan neighbors, they also carry betel chew and its ingredients in bamboo containers. Today only around 310 people speak the Ratagnon language, which is nearly extinct, out of an ethnic population of 2,000 people.

<text>The Episcopal Diocese of Texas is one of the dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. The diocese consists of all Episcopal congregations in the southeastern quartile of Texas, including the cities of Austin, Beaumont, Galveston, Houston (the see city), Waco and, as of July 2022, Fort Worth and other cities within the former diocese in North Texas.

The 174 congregations in the Diocese of Texas have ministries, locally and abroad. They include: homeless and feeding ministries, clinics, after school programs for at risk youth, ministry to seniors, ESL and citizenship classes and much more. 24 new churches have been planted in the diocese since 2012.

Institutions of the diocese include St. Vincent&#x27;s House, a social service agency, in Galveston; St. David&#x27;s Hospital, a healthcare system, in Austin; El Buen Samaritano, an agency to help working poor in Austin; COTS/LOTS, Community of the Streets, outreach to homeless men and women in midtown Houston; Episcopal High School, Houston; St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal School, Austin; and the Seminary of the Southwest in Austin.

The diocese traces its foundation to Christ Church in Matagorda in 1838, when it became the first foreign missionary field of the Episcopal Church (as part of the Republic of Texas). Together with Christ Church, Houston (1839) and Trinity Church, Galveston (1841) it formed the Episcopal Church of Texas, the Episcopal presence in the Republic of Texas. It formally became a diocese of the Episcopal Church in 1849. The diocese expanded to include the territory of the Episcopal Church in North Texas in 2022.

Christ Church became the cathedral of the diocese in 1949. The current bishop is C. Andrew Doyle (born 1966). He succeeded Don Wimberly as diocesan on June 7, 2009, upon Wimberly&#x27;s retirement.

==Previous bishops==
Missionary Bishops of Texas include Leonidas Polk and George Washington Freeman (until Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845). The diocese organized in 1849 and elected Alexander Gregg its first bishop in 1859. He served until 1893 when his coadjutor (elected to succeed), George Herbert Kinsolving, became Bishop of Texas. Kinsolving&#x27;s coadjutor, Clinton Simon Quin, succeeded him 35 years later in 1928.

John Hines served as bishop coadjutor under Quin for ten years and became diocesan in 1955. Nine years later, in 1964, Hines was elected Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church where he served for a decade. James Milton Richardson was consecrated the fifth Bishop of Texas on February 10, 1965, and served as diocesan until his death in 1980. The sixth Bishop of Texas, Maurice M. Benitez, was elected in 1980. In June 1993 Claude E. Payne was elected the fourth bishop coadjutor of the Diocese of Texas and became the seventh Bishop of Texas February 10, 1995. Don Wimberly became the eighth bishop of Texas in June, 2003, retiring at the mandatory age of 72 on June 6, 2009. Doyle, elected in May, 2008, was consecrated at St. Martins, Houston, on November 22, 2008, and invested and seated on June 7, 2009.

Additionally, Texas has had nine bishops suffragan and eight assistant bishops since becoming a diocese: F. Percy Goddard, James P. Clements, and Roger Howard Cilley; Scott Field Bailey; Gordon T. Charlton; William E. Sterling Sr., Leopoldo J. Alard, and Rayford B. High Jr. served as bishops suffragan. Dena Harrison served as bishop suffragan for the central region of the diocese; she was the thirteenth woman consecrated to the episcopate in the Episcopal Church and the first in a diocese in the South. She was succeeded by Kathryn &quot;Kai&quot; Ryan in 2019. Jeff W. Fisher was elected bishop suffragan for the east Texas region of the diocese on June 2, 2012, following the retirement of Rayford High in 2011. Anselmo Carral, William J. Cox, Don Wimberly, James B. Brown, Ted Daniels, John Buchanan, Hector Monterroso, and Brian R. Seage have served as assistant bishops.

<doc id="1268511" wikidata="Q133488" url="?curid=1268511" title="Kwaidan (film)">
<text>is a 1964 Japanese anthology horror film directed by Masaki Kobayashi. It is based on stories from Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s collections of Japanese folk tales, mainly &quot;&quot; (1904), for which it is named. The film consists of four separate and unrelated stories. &quot;Kwaidan&quot; is an archaic transliteration of the term , meaning &quot;ghost story&quot;. Receiving critical acclaim, the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Plot==
===&quot;The Black Hair&quot;===
 is adapted from &quot;The Reconciliation&quot; and &quot;The Corpse Rider&quot;, which appeared in Hearn&#x27;s collection &quot;Shadowings&quot; (1900).

An impoverished swordsman in Kyoto divorces his wife, a weaver, and leaves her for a woman of a wealthy family to attain greater social status. However, despite his new wealthy status, the swordsman&#x27;s second marriage proves to be unhappy. His new wife is shown to be callous and selfish. The swordsman regrets leaving his more devoted and patient ex-wife.

The second wife is furious when she realizes that the swordsman not only married her to obtain her family&#x27;s wealth, but also still longs for his old life in Kyoto with his ex-wife. When he is told to go into the chambers to reconcile with her, the swordsman refuses, stating his intent to return home and reconcile with his ex-wife. He points out his foolish behavior and poverty as the reasons why he reacted the way he did. The swordsman informs his lady-in-waiting to tell his second wife that their marriage is over and she can return to her parents in shame.

After a few years, the swordsman returns to find his home, and his wife, largely unchanged. He reconciles with his ex-wife, who refuses to let him punish himself. She mentions that Kyoto has &quot;changed&quot; and that they only have &quot;a moment&quot; together, but does not elaborate further. She assures him that she understood that he only left her in order to bring income to their home. The two happily exchange wonderful stories about the past and the future until the swordsman falls asleep. He wakes up the following day only to discover that he had been sleeping next to his ex-wife&#x27;s rotted corpse. Rapidly aging, he stumbles through the house, finding that it actually is in ruins and overgrown with weeds. He manages to escape, only to be attacked by his ex-wife&#x27;s black hair.

===&quot;The Woman of the Snow&quot;===
 is an adaptation from Hearn&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1903).

Two woodcutters named Minokichi and Mosaku take refuge in a boatman&#x27;s hut during a snowstorm. Mosaku is killed by a . When the yuki-onna turns to Minokichi, she sympathetically remarks that he is a handsome boy and spares him because of his youth, warning him to never mention what happened or she will kill him. Minokichi returns home and never mentions that night.

One day while cutting wood, Minokichi meets Yuki, a beautiful young woman travelling at sunset. She tells him that she lost her family and has relatives in Edo who can secure her a job as a lady-in-waiting. Minokichi offers to let her spend the night at his house with his mother. The mother takes a liking to Yuki and asks her to stay. She never leaves for Edo and Minokichi falls in love with her. The two marry and have children, living happily. The older women in the town are in awe over Yuki maintaining her youth even after having three children.

One night, Minokichi gives Yuki a set of sandals he has made. When she asks why he always gives her red ribbons on her sandals, he tells her of her youthful appearance. Yuki accepts the sandals and tries them on. She is stitching a kimono in the candlelight. In the light, Minokichi recalls the yuki-onna and sees a resemblance between them. He tells her about the strange encounter. It is then that Yuki reveals herself to be the yuki-onna, and a snowstorm comes over the home. Despite the fact he broke his word, she cannot bring herself to kill him because of her love for him and their children. Yuki then spares Minokichi and leaves on the condition that he treats their children well. As Yuki disappears into the snowstorm, a heartbroken Minokichi places her sandals outside in the snow, and after he goes back inside, Yuki takes the sandals with her.

===&quot;Hoichi the Earless&quot;===
 is also adapted from Hearn&#x27;s &quot;Kwaidan&quot; (though it incorporates aspects of &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; that are mentioned, but never translated, in Hearn&#x27;s book).

Hoichi is a young blind musician who plays the . His specialty is singing the chant of &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; about the Battle of Dan-no-ura fought between the Taira and Minamoto clans during the last phase of the Genpei War. Hoichi is an attendant at a temple and is looked after by the others there. One night he hears a sound and decides to play his instrument in the garden courtyard. A spectral samurai appears and tells him that his lord wishes to have a performance at his house. The samurai leads Hoichi to a mysterious and ancient court. Another attendant notices that he went missing for the night as his dinner was not touched. The samurai re-appears on the next night to take Hoichi and affirms that he has not told anyone. Afterwards, the priest asks Hoichi why he goes out at night but Hoichi will not tell him. One night, Hoichi leaves in a storm and his friends follow him and discover he has been going to a graveyard and reciting the Tale of Heike to the court of the dead Emperor. Hoichi informs the court that it takes many nights to chant the entire epic. They direct him to chant the final battle - the battle of Dan-no-ura. His friends drag him home as he refuses to leave before his performance is completed.

The priest tells Hoichi he is in great danger and that this was a vast illusion from the spirits of the dead, who plan to kill Hoichi if he obeys them again. Concerned for Hoichi&#x27;s safety, a priest and his acolyte write the text of the Heart Sutra on his entire body including his face to make him invisible to the ghosts and instruct him to meditate. The samurai re-appears and calls out for Hoichi, who does not answer. Hoichi&#x27;s ears are visible to the samurai as they forgot to write the text on his ears. The samurai, wanting to bring back as much of Hoichi as possible, rips his ears off to show his lord his commands have been obeyed.

The next morning, the priest and the attendants see a trail of blood leading from the temple. The priest and the acolyte realize their error and believe the ears were a trade for Hoichi&#x27;s life. They believe the spirits will now leave him alone. A local lord arrives at the temple with a full retinue. They have heard the story of Hoichi the earless and wish to hear him play his biwa. Hoichi is brought before the lord and says he will play to console the sorrowful spirits. The narrator states that many wealthy nobles came to the temple with large gifts of money, making Hoichi wealthy.

===&quot;In a Cup of Tea&quot;===
 is adapted from Hearn&#x27;s &quot;Kottō: Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs&quot; (1902).

Anticipating a visit from his publisher, a writer relates an old tale of an attendant of Lord Nakagawa Sadono named Sekinai. While Lord Nakagawa is on his way to make a New Year&#x27;s visit, he halts with his train at a teahouse in Hakusan. While the party is resting there, Sekinai sees the face of a strange man in a cup of tea. Despite being perturbed, he drinks the cup.

Later, while Sekinai is guarding his Lord, the man whose face appeared in the tea reappears, calling himself Heinai Shikibu. Sekinai runs to tell the other attendants, but they laugh and tell him he is seeing things. Later that night at his own residence, Sekinai is visited by three ghostly attendants of Heinai Shikibu. He duels them and is nearly defeated, but the author notes the tale ends before things are resolved and suggests that he could write a complete ending, but prefers to leave the ending to the reader&#x27;s imagination.

The publisher soon arrives and asks the Madame for the author, who is nowhere to be found. They both flee the scene in terror when they discover the author trapped inside a large jar of water.

==Production==
While he was a student, producer Shigeru Wakatsuki, founder, and CEO of Ninjin Club, converted the idea of a film adaptation of &quot;&quot;. In 1964, Toho began a three-film deal with director Masaki Kobayashi that concluded with the production of &quot;Kwaidan&quot;. Kobayashi worked with composer Takemitsu Toru for six months to produce the film&#x27;s score. The film exhausted its budget three quarters into production, which led Kobayashi to sell his house.

==Release==
&quot;Kwaidan&quot; premiered at the Yūrakuza Theater, the most prestigious theater in central Tokyo on December 29, 1964. The roadshow version of &quot;Kwaidan&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on January 6, 1965, where it was distributed by Toho. The Japanese general release for &quot;Kwaidan&quot; began on February 27, 1965. &quot;Kwaidan&quot; was reedited to 125 minutes in the United States for its theatrical release which eliminated the segment &quot;The Woman of the Snow&quot; after the film&#x27;s Los Angeles premiere. It was released in the United States on July 15, 1965, where it was distributed by Continental Distributing. &quot;Kwaidan&quot; was re-released theatrically in Japan on November 29, 1982, in Japan as part of Toho&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

==Reception==

In Japan, Yoko Mizuki won the &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; award for Best Screenplay. It also won awards for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction at the Mainichi Film Concours. The film won international awards including Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards.

In a 1967 review, the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; commented on the colour in the film, stating that &quot;it is not so much that the colour in &quot;Kwaidan&quot; is ravishing...as the way Kobayashi uses it to give these stories something of the quality of a legend.&quot; The review concluded that the &quot;Kwaidan&quot; was a film &quot;whose details stay on in the mind long after one has seen it.&quot; Bosley Crowther, in a 1965 &quot;New York Times&quot; review, stated that director Kobayashi &quot;merits excited acclaim for his distinctly oriental cinematic artistry. So do the many designers and cameramen who worked with him. &quot;Kwaidan&quot; is a symphony of color and sound that is truly past compare.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;done in measured cadence and intense feeling&quot; and that it was &quot;a visually impressive tour-de-force.&quot;
In his review of &quot;Harakiri&quot;, Roger Ebert described &quot;Kwaidan&quot; as &quot;an assembly of ghost stories that is among the most beautiful films I&#x27;ve seen&quot;. Philip Kemp wrote in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; that &quot;Kwaidan&quot; was &quot;almost too beautiful to be scary&quot; and that &quot;each tale sustains its own individual mood; but all are unforgettably, hauntingly beautiful.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Kwaidan&quot; holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 46 reviews, and an average rating of 7.9/10. Its consensus reads: &quot;Exquisitely designed and fastidiously ornate, Masaki Kobayashi&#x27;s ambitious anthology operates less as a frightening example of horror and more as a meditative tribute to Japanese folklore.&quot;

<doc id="1268514" wikidata="Q2500209" url="?curid=1268514" title="Mangyan">
<text>Mangyan is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found in Mindoro each with its own tribal name, language, and customs. The total population may be around 280,001, but official statistics are difficult to determine under the conditions of remote areas, reclusive tribal groups and some having little if any outside world contact.

The ethnic groups of the island, from north to south, are: Iraya, Alangan, Tadyawan, Tawbuid (called Batangan by lowlanders on the west of the island), Buhid, and Hanunoo. An additional group on the southernmost tip is the Ratagnon, who appear to be intermarried with neighboring Bisaya (Cuyonon) lowlanders. The group known on the east of Mindoro as Bangon may be a subgroup of Tawbuid, as they speak the &#x27;western&#x27; dialect of that language. They also have a kind of poetry called the &quot;ambahan&quot;.

==Origins==

The Mangyans were once the only inhabitants of Mindoro. Being coastal dwellers at first, they have moved inland and into the mountains to avoid the influx and influence of foreign settlers such as the Tagalogs, the Spanish and their conquests and religious conversion, and raids by the Moro. Today, the Mangyans live in relative seclusion along rivers in the highlands but periodically descend lowland to trade. Their sustenance are farming, fruit gathering, and hunting. A certain group of Mangyans living in Southern Mindoro call themselves Hanunó&#x27;o, meaning &quot;true&quot;, &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;genuine&quot;, a term that they use to stress the fact that they are strict in the sense of ancestral preservation of tradition and practices.

Before the Spaniards arrived in Mindoro, the people traded with the Chinese extensively, with thousands of pieces of supporting archaeological evidence found in Puerto Galera and in written Chinese references. A division was created among the people of Mindoro when the Spaniards came. There were the Iraya Mangyans, who isolated themselves from the culture of the Spaniards, and the lowland Tagalogs who submitted themselves to Christianity. These two groups only interacted for economic matters through trading forest goods from the Mangyan and consumer goods for the lowlanders.

Despite being grouped as one tribe, Mangyans differ in many ways. In comparison to the technological advance between the two geographical divisions, the southern Mangyan are considered more advanced as seen in their use of weaving, pottery and system of writing. In contrast, the northern Mangyan are simpler in their way of living. Their language, as in the rest of the Philippines, came from the Austronesian language family. However, even if they are defined as one ethnic group, the tribes used different languages. On the average, they only share 40% of their vocabulary.

Another difference between tribes is the date of their arrival in the Philippines. A theory suggests that the southern Mangyan were already present by 900 AD while the northern Mangyan are believed to have arrived hundreds of years later. The Spanish authorities had documented their existence since their arrival in the 16th century. However, historians suggest that the Mangyans may have been the first Filipinos to trade with the Chinese. Examples of this relationship are seen in the burial caves, as porcelains and other potteries abound. However, not much ethnographic research has been made except for the tribal and linguistic differences that may lead to the indication that the tribes can be treated separately.

==Ancestral lands==
Mangyan communities inhabit the island of Mindoro, laying claim to 40,000 hectares of forest lands. Hanunuo, Gubatnon, and Ratagnon (Hagura) Mangyan of Occidental Mindoro received a certificate of ancestral domain title (CADT) in December 2010 from President Benigno Aquino III. In July 2022, Tadyawan and Tau-buid Mangyan were the first Indigenous communities in Oriental Mindoro to receive their CADT from the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. The title covers 3,270.78 hectares of ancestral lands in Sabang in Pinamalayan town and Buong Lupa in Gloria town.

==Culture and practices==

Mangyan are mainly subsistence agriculturalists, planting a variety of sweet potato, upland (dry cultivation) rice, and taro. They also trap small animals and wild pig. Many who live in close contact with lowland Filipinos sell cash crops such as bananas and ginger.

Their languages are mutually unintelligible, though they share some vocabulary and use Hanunó&#x27;o script to write: Tawbuid and Buhid are closely related, and are unusual among Philippine languages in having an phoneme; Tawbuid is divided into eastern and western dialects; Western Tawbuid may be the only Philippine language to have no glottal phonemes, having neither or . They call the lowlanders or the people who live in local suburbs and plains &quot;damuong&quot;.

Their traditional religious world view is primarily animistic; around 10% have embraced Christianity, both Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism (The New Testaments have been published in six of the Mangyan languages).

=== Storytelling ===
Historically, Mangyan stories were orally transmitted. A select group of stories were preserved in poems and written in syllabic writing. These poems were carved into materials such as bamboo with a sharp object. Practicing oral tradition came with its own set of rules for the Mangyans. For example, folk tales called &quot;suyot&quot; were only to be told after the sun had set. The Mangyans believed telling stories during daylight would lead to rotting of the teeth.

There were several distinct types of oral works that the Mangyans practiced. There are no English equivalents for the names of Mangyan story categories. English speakers have given descriptive names for these categories.

* Song poems – Contain the taboos, beliefs, and customs of the Mangyan people. These stories were used to describe the origin of customs and the importance of practicing those customs.
* Folk beliefs and customs – These stories contain the taboos, beliefs, and customs of the Mangyan people. These stories were used to describe the origin of customs and the importance of practicing those customs.
* Riddles – These stories were used for entertainment. They were mind games and comical stories told in the evening to pass the time.
* Folk tales – There were three different types of folk tales told among the Mangyan people. Suyot is the oldest of the oral traditions. They were tales of legend, folklore, and fables. Sugklanon was another type of story, acquired through Bisayan influences. Tultulanon were stories of historical events.

The Mangyans also told stories about their day-to-day life to describe the world around them. There were stories about different medicines they used, and stories used to describe the varieties and characteristics of rice they cultivated. Most of our understanding of Mangyan culture and practices is derived from these oral and written accounts.

==Indigenous Mangyan religion==
The Mangyan have a complex spiritual belief system which includes the following deities:
*Mahal na Makaako – The Supreme Being who gave life to all human beings merely by gazing at them.
*Binayi – Owner of a garden where all spirits rest.
*Binayo – Is a sacred female spirit, caretaker of the rice spirits (&quot;kalag paray&quot;). She is married to Bulungabon. The kalag paray must be appeased to ensure a bountiful harvest. It is for this reason that specific rituals are conducted in every phase of rice cultivation. Some of these rituals include the &quot;panudlak&quot;, the rite of the first planting; the rite of rice planting itself; and the rites of harvesting which consist of the &quot;magbugkos&quot; or binding rice stalks, and the &quot;pamag-uhan&quot;, which follows the harvest.
*Bulungabon – The spirit aided by 12 fierce dogs. Erring souls are chased by these dogs and eventually drowned in a cauldron of boiling water. He is married to Binayo.

==Artifacts==
The Indigenous Mangyans offer a myriad of culturally rich artifacts that give insight into their culture and trade. The people living in Southern Mindoro during the pre-Hispanic era are exceptional in their weaving, pottery, and system of writing. Their clothing differs between genders. The male generally wears bahag loincloths as covering for the lower body, whereas the female would wear a skirt and a shirt for the top. The terms and materials would differ from tribe to tribe, but more exceptional designs would come from the Hanunó&#x27;os. Their textiles are dyed in indigo blue, with an embroidery design called &quot;pakudos&quot; at the back, and can also be found on their woven bags.

Their system of writing, called &quot;surat Mangyan&quot;, is a pre-Hispanic syllabic system and is believed to be of Indic origin. It is still practiced today and is still being taught in different Mangyan schools of Oriental Mindoro. The Hanunó&#x27;os also practice their own traditional poetry called the &quot;ambahan&quot;, a rhythmic poetic expression with a meter of seven syllables presented through recitation and chanting or inscribed on bamboo.

<text>Ann Lee Doran (July 28, 1911 – September 19, 2000) was an American character actress, possibly best known as Carol Stark, the mother of James &quot;Jim&quot; Stark (James Dean) in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). She was an early member of the Screen Actors Guild and served on the board of the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund for 30 years.

==Early years==
The daughter of Rose Allen (born Carrie A. Barnett) and John R. Doran, her mother was a silent-film actress. Ann Doran was born in Amarillo, Texas, and attended high school in San Bernardino, California.

==Film career==

Doran began acting at the age of four. According to a 1979 newspaper article, the actress made her debut at 11 years old. Rarely in a featured role, Doran appeared in more than 500 motion pictures and 1,000 episodes of television series, such as the American Civil War drama &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;.

Doran worked as a stand-in, then bit player, then incidental supporting player. By 1938, she was under contract to Columbia Pictures, where the company policy was to use the members of its stock company as often as possible. Thus, Doran appears in Columbia&#x27;s serials (such as &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; and &quot;Flying G-Men&quot;), short subjects (including those of The Three Stooges, Charley Chase, Andy Clyde, Harry Langdon and Vera Vague), B features (including the &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;Five Little Peppers&quot; and &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; series), and major feature films. She became a favorite of Columbia director Frank Capra and appeared in many of his productions. Most of these appearances were supporting roles. In &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941), she plays the wife of sodajerk-turned-John Doe Club activist Bert Hansen. Though her character speaks some of the film&#x27;s most pivotal lines of dialog, including an impassioned suicide-preventing plea in the final scene, her appearance in the film is uncredited. Some of Doran&#x27;s lead roles include Columbia&#x27;s Charley Chase comedies from 1938 to 1940 and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; (1938) directed by Sam Nelson and featuring Charles Starrett.

Columbia filmed two boy-and-his-dog stories with juvenile star Ted Donaldson in 1945–46. When the Donaldson films became a full-fledged series (featuring the dog Rusty) in 1947, Doran was cast as Donaldson&#x27;s mother in the next six films. Her steady, sensible maternal roles led to her being cast as James Dean&#x27;s mother in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955).
==Television==
Doran played Charlotte McHenry, the housekeeper on &quot;Shirley&quot;, Agnes Haskell, Eddie Haskell&#x27;s mother and in a separate appearance Mrs. Bellamy, in &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; and Mrs. Kingston, the housekeeper, on &quot;Longstreet&quot;.

Doran guest-starred on many television programs, including three appearances in the role of Bonnie Landis in &quot;Public Defender&quot;, starring with fellow Texan Reed Hadley. She appeared in the anthology series &quot;Crossroads&quot; in the 1956 episode &quot;The White Carnation&quot;, along with Elinor Donahue, James Best and J. Carrol Naish. In 1952, she appeared in an episode of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; titled &quot;Hidden Fortune&quot;.

Doran was cast in the children&#x27;s Western series &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, the story of a boy and his horse on a ranch in Wyoming. She also appeared in episodes of Ray Milland&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Meet Mr. McNutley&quot; and Kenneth Tobey&#x27;s aviation adventure series &quot;Whirlybirds&quot;. Doran guest-starred on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in &quot;The Case of the Prodigal Parent&quot; (1958), &quot;The Case of the Lurid Letter&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Case of the Drowsy Mosquito&quot; (1963) as well as in &quot;Rawhide&quot; in the episode &quot;Incident of the Challenge&quot;.

Doran was cast twice in 1959–1960 in episodes of the series &quot;Colt .45&quot;, starring Wayde Preston. In 1960, she was cast as Martha Brown, the mother of horse rider Velvet Brown (Lori Martin) in the family drama &quot;National Velvet&quot;. She made one appearance on &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; as Mrs. Martha &quot;Pumpkin&quot; Binghamton, wife of Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn). In 1963 Doran appeared as Minerva Lewis on &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode &quot;Run Away Home.&quot; Ann Doran was cast twice as Mrs. Elliott and Hugh Beaumont as Mr. Elliott, parents of Steve Elliott (Mike Minor), in &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;.

Three years later, she appeared in the first episode of &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot; as Zerelda James Samuel, the mother of Jesse and Frank James. She also appeared on the program &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; as Nurse Meg Cratty, who runs an orphanage in Korea. In the episode &quot;The Kids&quot;, Cratty and her charges bunked with the M*A*S*H unit after having to evacuate when the orphanage was shelled.

==Death==
Doran died at age 89 on September 19, 2000, in Carmichael, California. Following her death, her remains were cremated and scattered at sea. She bequeathed $400,000 to the Motion Picture Country House, the retirement home for the movie industry.

<text>The Dresden Suspension Railway () is a suspended funicular located in Dresden, Germany, and connects the districts of Loschwitz and Oberloschwitz (Rochwitz side). It is one of the oldest suspension railways, having entered service on 6 May 1901, the same year the Wuppertal Schwebebahn entered service. Like the Wuppertal railway, the system was designed by Eugen Langen. The line is long and is supported on 33 pillars.

==Overview==
Despite its unusual suspended format, the Dresden Suspension Railway is operated as a conventional funicular railway. The two cars are attached to each other by a cable, which runs around a drum at the top of the incline. The ascending car is pulled up the hill by the weight of the descending car, assisted if necessary by an electric drive to the drum.

The line has the following technical parameters:

* Length: &quot;
* Height: &quot;
* Maximum Steepness: &quot;39.2%&quot;
* Cars: &quot;2&quot;
* Capacity: &quot;40 passengers per car&quot;
* Configuration: &quot;Double suspension track (Monorail)&quot;
* Maximum speed: &quot;&quot;
* Traction: &quot;Electricity&quot;

The &quot;Schwebebahn&quot; was not damaged in World War II, but it was out of service from 1984 to 1992 due to reconstruction. In 1990 and 2002, extensive repair works took place and there is now a new lookout point on the roof of the upper station.

The &quot;Schwebebahn&quot; is one of two funicular railways in Dresden, the other being the much more conventional Dresden Cable Car. Both lines are operated by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe AG, who also operate the city&#x27;s tram, bus and ferry networks.

<doc id="1268530" wikidata="Q1381860" url="?curid=1268530" title="Even in the Quietest Moments...">
<text>Even in the Quietest Moments... is the fifth album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in April 1977. It was recorded mainly at Caribou Ranch in Colorado with overdubs, vocals, and mixing completed at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. This was Supertramp&#x27;s first album to use engineer Peter Henderson, who would work with the band for their next three albums as well.

&quot;Even in the Quietest Moments…&quot; reached number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums Chart in 1977 and within a few months of release became Supertramp&#x27;s first Gold (500,000 copies or more)–selling album in the US. In addition, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; became a US Top 20 single and reached number 29 on the UK Singles Chart. While &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; was the big hit, both &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot; and the title track also received a fair amount of FM album-rock play.

In 1978, &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments…&quot; was ranked 63rd in &quot;The World Critic Lists&quot;, which recognised the 200 greatest albums of all time as voted for by notable rock critics and DJs.

==Background and recording==
I think it was Roger who wanted to get out of Los Angeles to do a record. At the time, the sky was the limit, so we decided to record at the Caribou Ranch, on a mountaintop outside of Denver. What we didn&#x27;t realize was that the thin air in the mountains makes your voice go weird. It also made it hard for John [Helliwell] to play the sax. So we ended up finishing it back in L.A. at the Record Plant. – Rick Davies, &quot;Retrospectacle – The Supertramp Anthology&quot; CD booklet (2005)

Though all the songs are credited as being written jointly by Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, Davies wrote &quot;Lover Boy&quot;, &quot;Downstream&quot;, and &quot;From Now On&quot; by himself, and Hodgson in turn wrote &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot;, &quot;Babaji&quot;, and &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot; unaided.

Davies said of &quot;Lover Boy&quot; that &quot;I was inspired by advertisements in men&#x27;s magazines telling you how to pick up women. You know, you send away for it and it&#x27;s guaranteed not to fail. If you haven&#x27;t slept with at least five women in two weeks, you can get your money back.&quot; Bob Siebenberg recounted that &quot;Rick had been working on &#x27;Lover Boy&#x27; for quite a while and finally came up with the long middle section. I just heard that as a really slow, really solid sort of beat, just to give the song dynamics underneath it all, because the song itself is really powerful and it needed something really solid underneath it.&quot;

Most of &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot; was written during the soundcheck for a show at the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. Davies and Hodgson worked out the various parts of the song with Hodgson using an Oberheim and a Solina string synthesiser and Davies at the drum kit. Davies commented on the music: &quot;It starts off in a very standard melody thing and then it notches onto a sort of one chord progression or perhaps we should call it a digression. It&#x27;s a thing where there&#x27;s hundreds of sounds coming in and going out, a whole collage thing.&quot; Hodgson said of the lyrics: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a dual love song – it could be to a girl or it could be to God.&quot; Gary Graff of &quot;Billboard&quot; rated &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot; as Supertramp&#x27;s fourth-best song.

&quot;Downstream&quot; is performed solely by Davies on vocal and piano, which were recorded together in one take. Siebenberg has described the song as his favourite on the album &quot;because it&#x27;s so personal and so pure&quot;.

Graff rated &quot;From Now On&quot; as Supertramp&#x27;s eighth-best song, highlighting John Helliwell&#x27;s saxophone solo and the call-and-response singalong at the end.

&quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot; had the working title of &quot;The String Machine Epic&quot;, and according to John Helliwell: &quot;It came primarily from a few melodies Roger worked out on the string machine thing we use on stage.&quot; Written and sung by guitarist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson – who took five years to compose it – the song is a collage of progressive instrumentation and sound samples. Hodgson stated that the song&#x27;s lyrics are essentially meaningless, explaining: &quot;I like being vague and yet saying enough to set people&#x27;s imaginations running riot.&quot; He also said: First are excerpts of Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous 4 June 1940 House of Commons speech regarding Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Second World War (&quot;Never Surrender&quot;), followed by sounds of police cars and bells from London&#x27;s Big Ben clock tower. The flageolet-sounding instrument plays an excerpt from Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot;, from his orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot;. There is also a reading of the first verse of William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;Jerusalem&quot;), ended by a short sample of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Dreamer&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Nick DeRiso rated it as Supertramp&#x27;s seventh-best song. Hodgson rated it as one of the 10 best songs he has written.

==Artwork==
The front cover is a photo of an actual snow-covered piano and bench with a scenic mountain peak backdrop—an actual, but gutted, grand piano was brought to the Eldora Mountain Resort (a ski area near Caribou Ranch Studios)—which was left overnight and photographed after a fresh snowfall. The sheet music on the piano, though titled &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot;, is actually &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

A remastered CD version of the album with full original artwork, lyrics, and credits restored (including the inner sleeve picture of the band absent from the original CD) was released on 11 June 2002 on A&amp;M Records in the US.

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau remarked that, unlike most progressive rock, which is &quot;pretentious background schlock that&#x27;s all too hard to ignore&quot;, the album is &quot;modest background schlock that sounds good when it slips into the ear.&quot;

AllMusic gave a mixed retrospective review of the album, calling it &quot;elegant yet mildly absurd, witty but kind of obscure&quot;, but adding that it &quot;places a greater emphasis on melody and gentle textures than any previous Supertramp release&quot;. It criticised the album as not being &quot;full formed&quot;, but marked &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, &quot;Lover Boy&quot;, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot;, and &quot;From Now On&quot; as worthy of praise.

As of 2020, Laos has not qualified for the FIFA World Cup, AFC Asian Cup or Asian Games. Since making its appearance at the 1995 Southeast Asian Games, it has competed in the inaugural 1996 AFF Championship, drawing against Vietnam 1–1 and winning against Cambodia 1–0. In 1995, it beat Brunei and Philippines and 2 years later in the 1997 Southeast Asian Games held in Jakarta, it beat Malaysia 1–0 and Philippines 4–1. In the qualifying preliminary rounds for the 2004 Asian Cup, it beat Bangladesh 2–1. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, it qualified for the second round as a “lucky loser” after Guam and Nepal withdrew from the tournament, and proceeded to lose all its games (against Qatar, Iran and Jordan). It advanced to the second round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, after defeating Cambodia 8–6 on aggregate. In the second round, it lost to China 13–3 on aggregate. Its first appearance in a continental tournament was in 2014 when it played at the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup.

<doc id="1268543" wikidata="Q4722729" url="?curid=1268543" title="Alfred Gibson">
<text>Alfred Gibson (1874) was an Australian explorer who is believed to have died in an 1874 expedition organised by Ernest Giles, which sought to cross the deserts of Western Australia from east to west. Gibson departed from his companions on 22 April 1874 and was never seen again. The Gibson Desert into which he disappeared, was named after him by his fellow explorer.

Giles wrote:

&quot;Here a short young man accosted me, and asked me if I did not remember him, saying at the same time that he was &#x27;Alf&#x27;. I fancied I knew his face, but thought it was at the Peake that I had seen him, but he said &quot;Oh no, don&#x27;t you remember Alf with Bagot&#x27;s sheep at the north-west bend of the Murray? My name&#x27;s Alf Gibson, and I want to go out with you.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, can you shoe? Can you ride? Can you starve? Can you go without water? And how would you like to be speared by the blacks outside?&quot; He said he could do everything I had mentioned, and he wasn&#x27;t afraid of the blacks. He was not a man I would have picked out of a mob, but men were scarce, and as he seemed so anxious to come, and as I wanted somebody, I agreed to take him.&quot;

Gibson disappeared when he left Ernest Giles with a compass and his horse, going back to fetch some water for himself, the mare and Giles, leaving Giles walking. Gibson is thought to have lost his way, and was considered dead as he did not return.

<doc id="1268545" wikidata="Q256964" url="?curid=1268545" title="Wuppertal Schwebebahn">
<text>The Wuppertaler Schwebebahn () is a suspension railway in Wuppertal, Germany. The line was originally called in () named after its inventor, Eugen Langen. It is the oldest electric elevated railway with hanging cars in the world. Being grade-separated, it is considered rapid transit.

Langen first offered the technology to the cities of Berlin, Munich, and Breslau which all turned it down. However, the towns of Barmen, Elberfeld, and Vohwinkel along the banks of the river Wupper were intrigued by the technology’s ability to connect their communities. The elevated tracks and stations were built between 1897 and 1903; the first track opened in 1901. The railway line is credited with growth of the original cities and their eventual merger into Wuppertal. The &quot;&quot; is still in use as a local public transport line, moving 25 million passengers annually, per the 2008 annual report. New rail cars were ordered in 2015, called Generation 15, and the first new car went into service in December 2016.

The Schwebebahn runs along a route of , at a height of about above the river Wupper between and () and about above the valley road between and (). At one point the railway crosses the A46 motorway. The entire trip takes about 30 minutes. The Schwebebahn operates within the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) and accepts tickets issued by the VRR companies including the Deutschlandticket.

==History==
The Wuppertaler Schwebebahn had a forerunner: in 1824, Henry Robinson Palmer of Britain presented a railway system which differed from all previous constructions. It was a low single-rail suspension railway on which the carriages were drawn by horses. Friedrich Harkort, a Prussian industrial entrepreneur and politician, loved the idea. He saw big advantages for the transport of coal to the early industrialised region in and around the Wupper valley. Harkort had his own steel mill in Elberfeld; he built a demonstration segment of the Palmer system and set it up in 1826 on the grounds of what is today the Wuppertal tax office. He tried to attract public attention to his railway plans.

On 9 September 1826, the town councillors of Elberfeld met to discuss the use of a &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Railway&quot; from the Ruhr region, Hinsbeck, or Langenberg, to the Wupper valley, Elberfeld, connecting Harkort&#x27;s factories. Friedrich Harkort inspected the projected route with a surveyor and a member of the town council. The plans never went ahead because of protests from the transport branch and owners of mills that were not on the routes.

In 1887 the cities of Elberfeld and Barmen formed a commission for the construction of an elevated railway or &#x27;. In 1894 they chose the system of the engineer Eugen Langen of Cologne, and in 1896 the order was licensed by the City of Düsseldorf. In 2003, the Rhine Heritage Office (&#x27; or LVR) announced the discovery of an original section of the test route of the Schwebebahn.

Construction on the Schwebebahn began in 1898, overseen by the government&#x27;s master builder, Wilhelm Feldmann. On 24 October 1900, Emperor Wilhelm II participated in a monorail trial run.

In 1901 the railway came into operation. It opened in sections: the line from Kluse to Zoo/Stadion opened on 1 March, the line to the western terminus at Vohwinkel opened on 24 May; the line to the eastern terminus at Oberbarmen opened on 27 June 1903.
 Around of steel were used to produce the supporting frame and the stations. The construction cost 16 million gold marks. The railway was closed owing to severe damage during World War II, but reopened in 1946.

===Modernization===
The Schwebebahn carries approximately 80,000 passengers through the city per weekday. Since 1997, the supporting frame has been largely modernized, and many stations have been reconstructed and brought up to date technically. Kluse station, at the theatre in Elberfeld, was destroyed during the Second World War and was reconstructed during the modernization phase. Work was planned to be completed in 2001, but a serious accident took place in 1999 which left five people dead and 47 injured. That, along with delivery problems, delayed completion. By 2004, the cost of the reconstruction work had increased from €380 million to €480 million.

On 15 December 2009, the Schwebebahn suspended its operations due to safety concerns. Several of the older support structures needed to be renewed, a process that was completed on 19 April 2010.

In 2012, the Schwebebahn was closed for significant periods to allow upgrades to the system: from 7 to 21 July and 6 August to 22 October, and on weekends in September (15/16) and November (10/11). The modernization was completed and the line fully reopened on 19 August 2013.

In November 2018 a bus bar detached and fell to the ground but nobody was injured. Following this accident, the Schwebebahn was closed down for nearly nine months. It re-opened on 1 August 2019.

===Generation 15 trains===

On 10 November 2011, &quot;&quot; signed a contract with Vossloh Kiepe to supply a new fleet of Generation 15 or GTW 15 trains to gradually replace the ageing GTW 72 fleet. The 31 new articulated cars were assembled by Vossloh España in Valencia, Spain, featuring a light blue livery and having cushioned seating, air conditioning, information displays, LED lights, improved disabled access, and induction motors with energy recovery during braking. The first new train was commissioned by WSW in 2015 and entered regular passenger service on 18 December 2016, at which point the line&#x27;s power supply voltage was raised from 600 to 750 V.

The GTW 72 stock was gradually withdrawn from service as the new trains were introduced, the last of which operated immediately prior to the line&#x27;s shutdown in November 2018. WSW announced it would not scrap any of the GTW 72 stock, but instead offer 21 of the vehicles for sale and three for free, as long as they remained in the city of Wuppertal.
===Sister suspension railway===
Wuppertal Schwebebahn has a sister suspension railway relationships with Shonan Monorail since 2018. Shonan Monorail is a suspension railway located in Kanagawa, Japan and connects the cities between Kamakura and Fujisawa. Starting in 2018, both suspension railways made a campaign of their twinning.

==Technology==

The cars are suspended from a single rail built underneath a supporting steel frame. The cars hang on wheels which are driven by multiple electric motors operating at 600 or , fed from a live rail below the running rail.

Until August 2019, the Schwebebahn used block signalling like other light- and heavy-rail systems. Signals with red, green, and yellow lights, present at every station, signalled the driver if the next block, usually continuing until the next station, was free or not. The yellow aspect was mostly used to warn about construction work ahead, while a blinking red light warned about more severe problems. Today, the Schwebebahn uses the European Train Control System, allowing for shorter distances between trains.

The supporting frame and tracks are made out of 486 pillars and bridgework sections. When the line was originally built, Anton Rieppel, head of MAN-Werk Gustavsburg, designed the structural system, which he patented. At each end of the line is a servicing depot, including a loop of track to allow the trains to be turned around.

The current fleet consists of 31 articulated cars. The cars are 24 metres long and have 4 doors. One carriage can seat 48 with approximately 130 standing passengers. The top speed is and the average speed is .

The &quot;&quot; (Emperor&#x27;s car), the original train used by Emperor Wilhelm II during a test ride on 24 October 1900, is still operated on scheduled excursion services, special occasions and for charter events.

==Incidents==
;15 January 1917
:A train rear-ended another train that had stopped unexpectedly in front of it between Oberbarmen and Wupperfeld, causing the trailing car of the stopped train to fall off the track. There were two minor injuries. Subsequently, a safety device was developed to make derailments nearly impossible.
;21 July 1950
:The Althoff Circus organised a publicity stunt by putting a baby elephant on a train at Alter Markt station. As the elephant started to bump around during the ride, she fell out of the car and into the river Wupper. The elephant, two journalists, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. After that jump, the elephant got the name , meaning &#x27;waterdive&#x27; in Italian. The official of the railway and the circus director were fined after the incident.
;11 September 1968
:A truck crashed into a pillar and caused a section of track to fall. There were no trains in the area at the time. This incident led to the use of concrete barriers around the pillar anchors.
;25 March 1997
:A technical malfunction caused a rear-end collision in Oberbarmen station between a structure train and the . There were 14 injuries, but no derailment.
;12 April 1999
:
:The line&#x27;s first and only fatal accident occurred close to station during maintenance work in the early morning hours of 12 April 1999. Workers had forgotten to remove a metal claw from the track on completion of scheduled night work. The first train of the day hit the claw at a speed of around , derailed, and fell about into the river Wupper, killing five passengers and injuring 47, some seriously. The salvage operation took three days and nights to complete. Eight weeks after the incident, the Schwebebahn returned to operation. The cost of the damage was approximately 8 million marks.
:The judicial inquiry into the incident highlighted that the disaster was not caused by technical defects or mechanical system failure, but by the negligence of workers who had fallen behind in their schedule during the preceding night, and abandoned the work site hastily ten minutes before the train departed from the depot. Contributing to the accident was a lack of control of their activities by site supervisors.
:The works manager in charge of safety, and the workers dealing with the steel claw, were acquitted of all charges by the District Court of Wuppertal. The site supervision personnel, having neglected their duties of control, were sentenced for involuntary manslaughter in five cases and bodily injury caused by negligence in 47 cases, but given probation under verdict 4 StR 289/01, dated 31 January 2002.
:Since then, it has become a custom to follow every repair work to the line by a test run at slow speed, even though this is not prescribed by law.

;5 August 2008
:A train collided with a crane truck making deliveries under the track, causing a tear in the floor of one of the cars. The truck driver was seriously injured, and the train driver and some passengers were treated for shock.
;17 October 2013
:A section of power rail long fell from the track onto Federal Route 7, damaging several cars parked underneath and forcing closure of the road. The city&#x27;s fire service had to rescue 76 passengers from a stranded train. No one was injured.
;November 2018
:A long section of the power rail fell to the ground, extensively damaging a parked car. After the replacement of 18,000 support clamps, the line reopened in August 2019.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
The Schwebebahn is alluded to in Theodor Herzl&#x27;s 1902 utopian novel &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Old New Land&quot;). For Herzl, the Schwebebahn was the ideal form of urban transport, and he imagined a large monorail built in its style in Haifa.

===Film===
A sequence in Peter Delpeut&#x27;s 1992 collage film &quot;Lyrical Nitrate&quot;, using film from between 1905 and 1915, features the Schwebebahn. Rüdiger Vogler and Yella Rottländer&#x27;s characters ride the Schwebebahn in Wim Wenders&#x27;s 1974 movie &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot; (&#x27;). It also appears in the 1992 Dutch movie &quot;The Sunday Child&quot; (&#x27;) by Pieter Verhoeff, in Tom Tykwer&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;The Princess and the Warrior&quot; (&quot;&quot;), and as a background to a number of outdoor dance choreographies in another Wim Wenders film – 2011&#x27;s &quot;Pina&quot;, where some dances are also set inside the cars.

The Schwebebahn is both subject and title of video work by the Turner Prize-nominated artist Darren Almond. Produced in 1995, Schwebebahn is the first of three videos that constitute his Train Trilogy.

The Museum of Modern Art has a two-minute film from 1902 featuring the Schwebebahn.
A colourized and upscaled version of the 1902 film is now available
 and has been matched with a recent video.

===Other fiction===
Some of the events in , a Belgian in the &quot;Yoko Tsuno&quot; series, take place in the &quot;&quot;.

The denouement of the episode of the 1972 ITC TV series &quot;The Adventurer&quot; called &quot;I&#x27;ll Get There Sometime&quot; takes place on the railway.

===Video games===
In 2013 the &quot;Schwebebahn Simulator 2013&quot; was launched for Windows, Mac OS X and Wii U. In this simulator, the player controls the GTW 72.

In the &quot;Add-on Wuppertal&quot; DLC of the OMSI 2 bus simulator, there is the option for the player to control the Schwebebahn of the newest model (GTW 15), with all stations faithfully recreated.

<doc id="1268560" wikidata="Q5648528" url="?curid=1268560" title="Hankel contour">
<text>In mathematics, a Hankel contour is a path in the complex plane which extends from 
(+∞,δ), around the origin counter clockwise and back to
(+∞,−δ), where δ is an arbitrarily small positive number. The contour thus remains arbitrarily close to the real axis but without crossing the real axis except for negative values of &quot;x&quot;. The Hankel contour can also be represented by a path that has mirror images just above and below the real axis, connected to a circle of radius ε, centered at the origin, where ε is an arbitrarily small number. The two linear portions of the contour are said to be a distance of δ from the real axis. Thus, the total distance between the linear portions of the contour is 2δ. The contour is traversed in the positively-oriented sense, meaning that the circle around the origin is traversed counter-clockwise.

Use of Hankel contours is one of the methods of contour integration. This type of path for contour integrals was first used by Hermann Hankel in his investigations of the Gamma function.

The Hankel contour is used to evaluate integrals such as the Gamma function, the Riemann zeta function, and other Hankel functions (which are Bessel functions of the third kind).

== Applications ==

=== The Hankel contour and the Gamma function ===
The Hankel contour is helpful in expressing and solving the Gamma function in the complex &quot;t&quot;-plane. The Gamma function can be defined for any complex value in the plane if we evaluate the integral along the Hankel contour. The Hankel contour is especially useful for expressing the Gamma function for any complex value because the end points of the contour vanish, and thus allows the fundamental property of the Gamma function to be satisfied, which states formula_1.

==== Derivation of the contour integral expression of the Gamma function ====
The Hankel contour can be used to help derive an expression for the Gamma function,
based on the fundamental property formula_2.
Assume an ansatz of the form formula_3, where formula_4 is the Hankel contour.

Inserting this ansatz into the fundamental property and integrating by parts on the right-hand side, one obtains
formula_5

Thus, assuming formula_6 decays sufficiently quickly such that formula_7 vanishes at the endpoints of the Hankel contour,
formula_8

The solution to this differential equation is
formula_9
While formula_10 is a constant with respect to formula_11, formula_10 may nonetheless be a function of formula_13. 
Substituting formula_6 into the original integral then gives
formula_15
where the minus sign in formula_16 is accounted for by absorbing a factor formula_17 into the definition of formula_18.

By integrating along the Hankel contour, the contour integral expression of the Gamma function becomes formula_19.

<doc id="1268561" wikidata="Q7992510" url="?curid=1268561" title="When Hell Was in Session">
<text>When Hell Was in Session is a 1975 memoir by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Jeremiah Denton, recounting his experiences as an American prisoner of war (POW) during the Vietnam War.

==Synopsis==
A Navy pilot, Denton&#x27;s jet was shot down over North Vietnam in July 1965. Denton and his navigator, Bill Tschudy, parachuted down and were soon taken prisoner. Both men spent seven years and seven months in North Vietnam as often-tortured POWs. In May 1966, the North Vietnamese allowed a Japanese TV reporter to interview him, where he blinked out the word &quot;torture&quot; in Morse code, confirming the United States suspicions that prisoners were being mistreated during the Vietnam War.

==Film adaption, documentary and updated version==
In 1979, the book was made into a television movie starring Hal Holbrook. It was adapted by screenwriter Jake Justiz, also known as Lee Pogostin.

Denton, James Stockdale, Larry Guarino, and James Robinson Risner, distinguished themselves as members of the American POW resistance movement from 1965 to 1973, helping POWs accomplish their sworn goal to &quot;return with honor&quot;. &quot;Return with Honor&quot; was later used as the title of a documentary film released in 2000 about American POWs during the Vietnam War, narrated and produced by actor Tom Hanks. In November 2009, an updated version of the book was released with the following epilogue from Denton:
==Reception==
The &quot;Library Journal&quot; said that &quot;while the nature of the material is well calculated to hold the reader&#x27;s interest, the narrative skips and jumps in a disruptive manner&quot;. They also noted that &quot;the author at time becomes overbearingly righteous in his presentation, and the overall impression is one of haste&quot;.

<text>Purified water is water that has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove impurities and make it suitable for use. Distilled water was, formerly, the most common form of purified water, but, in recent years, water is more frequently purified by other processes including capacitive deionization, reverse osmosis, carbon filtering, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, ultraviolet oxidation, or electrodeionization. Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce ultrapure water of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). 

Purified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It is also used in the commercial beverage industry as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain product consistency. It can be produced on-site for immediate use or purchased in containers. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water that has been treated (&quot;rendered potable&quot;) to neutralize, but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.

==Parameters of water purity==

Purified water is usually produced by the purification of drinking water or ground water. The impurities that may need to be removed are:
*inorganic ions (typically monitored as electrical conductivity or resistivity or specific tests)
*organic compounds (typically monitored as TOC or by specific tests)
*bacteria (monitored by total viable counts or epifluorescence)
*endotoxins and nucleases (monitored by LAL or specific enzyme tests)
*particulates (typically controlled by filtration)
*gases (typically managed by degassing when required)

==Purification methods==

===Distillation===
Distilled water is produced by a process of distillation. Distillation involves boiling the water and then condensing the vapor into a clean container, leaving solid contaminants behind. Distillation produces very pure water. A white or yellowish mineral scale is left in the distillation apparatus, which requires regular cleaning. Distilled water, like all purified water, must be stored in a sterilized container to guarantee the absence of bacteria. For many procedures, more economical alternatives are available, such as deionized water, and are used in place of distilled water.

===Double distillation===
Double-distilled water (abbreviated &quot;ddH2O&quot;, &quot;Bidest. water&quot; or &quot;DDW&quot;) is prepared by slow boiling the uncontaminated condensed water vapor from a prior slow boiling. Historically, it was the de facto standard for highly purified laboratory water for biochemistry and used in laboratory trace analysis until combination purification methods of water purification became widespread.

===Deionization===

Deionized water (&quot;DI water&quot;, &quot;DIW&quot; or &quot;de-ionized water&quot;), often synonymous with &quot;demineralized water / DM water&quot;, is water that has had almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as cations like sodium, calcium, iron, and copper, and anions such as chloride and sulfate. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured ion-exchange resins, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. 

However, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses, or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove Gram-negative bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using electrodeionization.

Three types of deionization exist: co-current, counter-current, and mixed bed.

====Co-current deionization====
Co-current deionization refers to the original downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter at the top of an ion-exchange column and exit at the bottom. Co-current operating costs are comparatively higher than counter-current deionization because of the additional usage of regenerants. Because regenerant chemicals are dilute when they encounter the bottom or finishing resins in an ion-exchange column, the product quality is lower than a similarly sized counter-flow column.

The process is still used, and can be maximized with the fine-tuning of the flow of regenerants within the ion exchange column.

====Counter-current deionization====
Counter-current deionization comes in two forms, each requiring engineered internals:
#Upflow columns where input water enters from the bottom and regenerants enter from the top of the ion exchange column.
#Upflow regeneration where water enters from the top and regenerants enter from the bottom.

In both cases, separate distribution headers (input water, input regenerant, exit water, and exit regenerant) must be tuned to: the input water quality and flow, the time of operation between regenerations, and the desired product water analysis.

Counter-current deionization is the more attractive method of ion exchange. Chemicals (regenerants) flow in the opposite direction to the service flow. Less time for regeneration is required when compared to cocurrent columns. The quality of the finished product can be as low as .5 parts per million. The main advantage of counter-current deionization is the low operating cost, due to the low usage of regenerants during the regeneration process.

====Mixed bed deionization====
Mixed bed deionization is a 40/60 mixture of cation and anion resin combined in a single ion-exchange column. With proper pretreatment, product water purified from a single pass through a mixed bed ion exchange column is the purest that can be made. Most commonly, mixed bed demineralizers are used for final water polishing to clean the last few ions within water prior to use. Small mixed bed deionization units have no regeneration capability. Commercial mixed bed deionization units have elaborate internal water and regenerant distribution systems for regeneration. A control system operates pumps and valves for the regenerants of spent anions and cations resins within the ion exchange column. Each is regenerated separately, then remixed during the regeneration process. Because of the high quality of product water achieved, and because of the expense and difficulty of regeneration, mixed bed demineralizers are used only when the highest purity water is required.

===Softening===

Softening consists in preventing the possible precipitation of poorly soluble minerals from natural water due to changes occurring in the physico-chemical conditions (such as pCO2, pH, and Eh). It is applied when poorly soluble ions present in water might precipitate as insoluble salts (e.g., , ...), or interact with a chemical process. The water is &quot;softened&quot; by exchanging poorly soluble divalent cations (mainly , and ) with the soluble cation. Softened water has therefore a higher electrical conductivity than deionized water. Softened water cannot be considered as truly demineralized water, but does no longer contain cations responsible for the hardness of water and causing the formation of limescale, a hard chalky deposit essentially consisting of CaCO3, building up inside kettles, hot water boilers, and pipework.

===Demineralization===
In the strict sense, the term demineralization should imply removing all dissolved mineral species from water. Thus not only removing dissolved salt as obtained by simple deionization, but also neutral dissolved species such as dissolved iron hydroxides () or dissolved silica (), two solutes often present in water. In this way, demineralized water has the same electrical conductivity as deionized water, but is purer because it does not contain non-ionized substances, &quot;i.e.&quot; neutral solutes. However, demineralized water is often used interchangeably with deionized water and can be also confused with softened water, depending on the exact definition used: removing only the cations susceptible to precipitate as insoluble minerals (from there, &quot;demineralization&quot;), or removing all the &quot;mineral species&quot; present in water, and thus not only dissolved ions but also neutral solute species. So, the term demineralized water is vague and deionized water or softened water should often be preferred in its place for more clarity.

===Other processes===

Other processes are also used to purify water, including reverse osmosis, carbon filtration, microporous filtration, ultrafiltration, ultraviolet oxidation, or electrodialysis. These are used in place of, or in addition to, the processes listed above. Processes rendering water potable but not necessarily closer to being pure H2O / hydroxide + hydronium ions include the use of dilute sodium hypochlorite, ozone, mixed-oxidants (electro-catalyzed H2O + NaCl), and iodine; See discussion regarding potable water treatments under &quot;Health effects&quot; below.

==Uses==
Purified water is suitable for many applications, including autoclaves, hand-pieces, laboratory testing, laser cutting, and automotive use. Purification removes contaminants that may interfere with processes, or leave residues on evaporation. Although water is generally considered to be a good electrical conductor—for example, domestic electrical systems are considered particularly hazardous to people if they may be in contact with wet surfaces—&quot;pure&quot; water is a poor conductor. The conductivity of water is measured in Siemens per meter (S/m). Sea-water is typically 5 S/m, drinking water is typically in the range of 5-50 mS/m, while highly purified water can be as low as 5.5 μS/m (0.055 μS/cm), a ratio of about 1,000,000:1,000:1.

Purified water is used in the pharmaceutical industry. Water of this grade is widely used as a raw material, ingredient, and solvent in the processing, formulation, and manufacture of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates, compendial articles, and analytical reagents. The microbiological content of the water is of importance and the water must be regularly monitored and tested to show that it remains within microbiological control.

Purified water is also used in the commercial beverage industry as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain critical consistency of taste, clarity, and color. This guarantees the consumer reliably safe and satisfying drinking. In the process prior to filling and sealing, individual bottles are always rinsed with deionised water to remove any particles that could cause a change in taste.

Deionised and distilled water are used in lead–acid batteries to prevent erosion of the cells, although deionised water is the better choice as more impurities are removed from the water in the creation process.

===Laboratory use===
Technical standards on water quality have been established by a number of professional organizations, including the American Chemical Society (ACS), ASTM International, the U.S. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) which is now CLSI, and the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). The ASTM, NCCLS, and ISO 3696 or the International Organization for Standardization classify purified water into Grade 1–3 or Types I–IV depending on the level of purity. These organizations have similar, although not identical, parameters for highly purified water.

Note that the European Pharmacopeia uses Highly Purified Water (HPW) as a definition for water meeting the quality of Water For Injection, without however having undergone distillation. In the laboratory context, highly purified water is used to denominate various qualities of water having been &quot;highly&quot; purified.

Regardless of which organization&#x27;s water quality norm is used, even Type I water may require further purification depending on the specific laboratory application. For example, water that is being used for molecular-biology experiments needs to be DNase or RNase-free, which requires special additional treatment or functional testing. Water for microbiology experiments needs to be completely sterile, which is usually accomplished by autoclaving. Water used to analyze trace metals may require the elimination of trace metals to a standard beyond that of the Type I water norm.

====Criticism====
A member of the ASTM D19 (Water) Committee, Erich L. Gibbs, criticized ASTM Standard D1193, by saying &quot;Type I water could be almost anything – water that meets some or all of the limits, part or all of the time, at the same or different points in the production process.&quot;

====Electrical conductivity====
Completely de-gassed ultrapure water has a conductivity of 1.2 × 10−4 S/m, whereas on equilibration to the atmosphere it is 7.5 × 10−5 S/m due to dissolved CO2 in it. The highest grades of ultrapure water should not be stored in glass or plastic containers because these container materials leach (release) contaminants at very low concentrations. Storage vessels made of silica are used for less-demanding applications and vessels of ultrapure tin are used for the highest-purity applications. It is worth noting that, although electrical conductivity only indicates the presence of ions, the majority of common contaminants found naturally in water ionize to some degree. This ionization is a good measure of the efficacy of a filtration system, and more expensive systems incorporate conductivity-based alarms to indicate when filters should be refreshed or replaced. For comparison, seawater has a conductivity of perhaps 5 S/m (53 mS/cm is quoted), while normal un-purified tap water may have conductivity of 5 × 10−3 S/m (50 μS/cm) (to within an order of magnitude), which is still about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than the output from a well-functioning demineralizing or distillation mechanism, so low levels of contamination or declining performance are easily detected.

===Industrial uses===
Some industrial processes, notably in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, need large amounts of very pure water. In these situations, feedwater is first processed into purified water and then further processed to produce ultrapure water.

Another class of ultrapure water used for pharmaceutical industries is called Water-For-Inject (WFI), typically generated by multiple distillation or compressed-vaporation process of DI water or RO-DI water. It has a tighter bacteria requirement as 10 CFU per 100 mL, instead of the 100 CFU per mL per USP.

===Other uses===
Distilled or deionized water is commonly used to top up the lead–acid batteries used in cars and trucks and for other applications. The presence of foreign ions commonly found in tap water will drastically shorten the lifespan of a lead–acid battery.

Distilled or deionized water is preferable to tap water for use in automotive cooling systems.

Using deionised or distilled water in appliances that evaporate water, such as steam irons and humidifiers, can reduce the build-up of mineral scale, which shortens appliance life. Some appliance manufacturers say that deionised water is no longer necessary.

Purified water is used in freshwater and marine aquariums. Since it does not contain impurities such as copper and chlorine, it helps to keep fish free from diseases and avoids the build-up of algae on aquarium plants due to its lack of phosphate and silicate. Deionized water should be re-mineralized before use in aquaria since it lacks many macro- and micro-nutrients needed by plants and fish.

Water (sometimes mixed with methanol) has been used to extend the performance of aircraft engines. In piston engines, it acts to delay the onset of engine knocking. In turbine engines, it allows more fuel flow for a given turbine temperature limit and increases mass flow. As an example, it was used on early Boeing 707 models. Advanced materials and engineering have since rendered such systems obsolete for new designs; however, spray-cooling of incoming air-charge is still used to a limited extent with off-road turbo-charged engines (road-race track cars).

Deionized water is very often used as an ingredient in many cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. &quot;Aqua&quot; is the standard name for water in the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients standard, which is mandatory on product labels in some countries.

Because of its high relative dielectric constant (~80), deionized water is also used (for short durations, when the resistive losses are acceptable) as a high voltage dielectric in many pulsed power applications, such as the Sandia National Laboratories Z Machine.

Distilled water can be used in PC water-cooling systems and Laser Marking Systems. The lack of impurity in the water means that the system stays clean and prevents a buildup of bacteria and algae. Also, the low conductance reduces the risk of electrical damage in the event of a leak. However, deionized water has been known to cause cracks in brass and copper fittings.

When used as a rinse after washing cars, windows, and similar applications, purified water dries without leaving spots caused by dissolved solutes.

Deionized water is used in water-fog fire-extinguishing systems used in sensitive environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The &#x27;sprinkler&#x27; nozzles use much finer spray jets than other systems and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The extremely fine mist produced takes the heat out of fire rapidly, and the fine droplets of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and are less likely to damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic, and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.

Distilled or purified water is used in humidors to prevent cigars from collecting bacteria, mold, and contaminants, as well as to prevent residue from forming on the humidifier material.

Window cleaners using water-fed pole systems also use purified water because it enables the windows to dry by themselves leaving no stains or smears. The use of purified water from water-fed poles also prevents the need for using ladders and therefore ensure compliance with Work at Height Legislation in the UK.

==Mineral consumption==
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water, which has not been proven to be healthier than drinking water. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and found that demineralized water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water may help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10 mg/L with 20–30 mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20 mg/L minimum and a 40–80 mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2–4 mmol/L. For fluoride, the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5–1.0 mg/L, with a maximum guideline value of 1.5 mg/L to avoid dental fluorosis.

Municipal water supplies often add or have trace impurities at levels that are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as volatile organic compounds, fluoride, and an estimated 75,000+ other chemical compounds are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.

<text>Norman L. Blake (born March 10, 1938) is a traditional American stringed instrument artist and songwriter. He is half of the eponymous Norman &amp; Nancy Blake band with his wife, Nancy Blake.

==Music career==

===Early performing===
Blake was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and grew up in Sulphur Springs, Alabama. He listened to old-time and country music on the radio by the Carter Family, the Skillet Lickers, Roy Acuff, and the Monroe Brothers (Charlie and Bill Monroe). He learned guitar at age 11 or 12, then mandolin, dobro, and fiddle in his teens. When he was 16, he dropped out of school to play music professionally.

In the 1950s, Blake joined the Dixieland Drifters and performed on radio broadcasts, then joined the Lonesome Travelers. When he was drafted in 1961, he served as an Army radio operator in the Panama Canal Zone. He started a popular band known as the Kobbe Mountaineers. A year later, while he was on leave, he recorded the album &quot;Twelve Shades of Bluegrass&quot; with the Lonesome Travelers.

===Nashville and Johnny Cash===
After being discharged from the Army, Blake moved to Nashville and became a studio musician. For 10 years, he toured and recorded with country singer Johnny Cash and continued to play with Cash intermittently over the next 30. He met Nancy Short, a cellist with a classical music background who was playing in a folk group. He was asked by Bob Dylan to play on the country-folk album &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, then became a member of the house band on Johnny Cash&#x27;s TV show. Kris Kristofferson, one of the guests, hired Blake to tour with him. Blake recorded with folk singer Joan Baez and appeared on her hit song &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;. In 1971, he became a member of the bluegrass group Aero-plain, led by multi-instrumentalist John Hartford with fiddler Vassar Clements, a short-lived project.

Blake also played dobro on the 1972 album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

In 1972, Blake recorded his first solo album, &quot;Home in Sulphur Springs&quot; (Rounder, 1972). Soon after his debut, he and Nancy recorded their first album, &quot;The Fields of November&quot; (Flying Fish, 1974), with Nancy on hillbilly cello. They married in 1975 and performed together for twenty years.

===Style===
Most of the music that Norman Blake plays could be described as neo-traditionalist Americana folk and roots music (folk, bluegrass, country, blues), and many of the songs he plays are traditional, but he plays this acoustic type of music with a style, speed, and quality that has evolved and progressed in the modern age. Though probably best known for his fluid renditions of classic fiddle tunes transcribed for the guitar (&quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Dram/Whiskey Before Breakfast&quot;), Blake has also written songs that have become bluegrass and folk standards, such as &quot;Ginseng Sullivan&quot;, &quot;Slow Train through Georgia&quot;, &quot;Billy Gray&quot;, and &quot;Church Street Blues&quot;.

Blake has also written and published songs of a political nature, such as &quot;Don’t Be Afraid of the Neo-Cons.&quot;

Blake is known for his tastefully simple-sounding style, saying, &quot;I’m more interested in the music and the tone than I am the licks.&quot;

Although known as one of the most prominent steel-string guitar flatpickers, Blake is a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist. Other instruments he plays include the mandolin, 6-string banjo, fiddle, dobro, banjo and viola. He is known for his loose, right-hand guitar technique, which arose out of his mandolin technique. Also well known is his devotion to 12-fret guitars, including Martin 00s, 000s, D18s, D28s, and Gibsons, like his 1929 12-fret Nick Lucas special.

=== Collaborations ===
Blake has collaborated with Tony Rice on the albums, &quot;Blake and Rice,&quot; and &quot;Blake and Rice 2,&quot; which include many tunes, including some of Blake&#x27;s originals. Blake also released an album with Mike Compton called, &quot;Gallop to Georgia,&quot; which showcases many Old-Time tunes.

===Awards and honors===
Blake played on the album &quot;Raising Sand&quot; by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, which won five Grammy Awards, and on the soundtrack &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, which won a Grammy for Album of the Year.

Norman &amp; Nancy Blake received Grammy nominations in the Best Traditional Folk Recording category for &quot;Blind Dog&quot;, &quot;Just Gimme Somethin&#x27; I&#x27;m Used To&quot;, &quot;While Passing Along This Way&quot;, and &quot;The Hobo&#x27;s Last Ride&quot;. In 1986 Norman Blake was chosen Best Multi-Instrumentalist by the readers of &quot;Frets&quot; magazine.

<text>Escape From Reason is a philosophical work written by American theologian and Christian apologist Francis A. Schaeffer, London: InterVarsity Press, first published in 1968. It is Book Two in Volume One of &quot;The Complete Works of Francis A. Schaeffer A Christian Worldview.&quot; Westchester, IL:Crossway Books, 1982. This is the second book of Francis Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy.&quot; It was written and published after &quot;The God Who Is There&quot; was written but released before that first book.

==Overview==
Unlike the first (&quot;The God Who Is There&quot;), and third (&quot;He Is There and He Is Not Silent&quot;) works in Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Escape from Reason&quot; is only loosely divided into seven chapters. Instead, each chapter contains a number of small sections, which offer a much clearer division of the prose. There are 39 such sections in all.

<text>The Federal Assembly is the bicameral national legislature of Russia. The upper house is the Federation Council, and the lower house is the State Duma. The assembly was established by the Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993, replacing the former Supreme Soviet of Russia. It is located in Moscow.

The Chairman of the Federation Council is the third most important position after the President and the Prime Minister. In the case that both the President and the Prime Minister are incapacitated, the Speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament becomes Acting President of Russia.

The jurisdiction of the Federation Council includes: approval of changes in borders between federal subjects of Russia, approval of the presidential decree on the introduction of a martial law or on the introduction of a state of emergency, deciding on the possibility of using the Armed Forces of Russia outside the territory of Russia, appointment of elections of the President, impeachment of the President, appointment of judges of higher courts of Russia, appointment and dismissal of the Prosecutor General of Russia, appointment and dismissal of Deputy Chairman and half of the auditors of the all Accounts Chamber and others.

The jurisdiction of the State Duma includes: consent to the appointment of the Prime Minister (Chairman of the Government), deciding the issue of confidence in the Government, appointment and dismissal of the Governor of the Central Bank, appointment and dismissal of the Chairman and half of the auditors of the Accounts Chamber, appointment and dismissal of the Commissioner for Human Rights, proclamation of amnesty, advancing of charges against the President for his impeachment and others.

Since the 2003 elections, the Federal Assembly has been referred to by analysts and observers as being a rubber stamp institution.

==Powers==
As the Russian legislature, all laws must be voted in the Federal Assembly before they are signed into law. All bills, even those proposed by the Federation Council, must first be considered by the State Duma. Upon adoption by a majority of the full State Duma membership, a draft law is considered by the Federation Council, which has fourteen days to place the bill on its calendar. The Federation Council cannot make changes in bills passed by the Duma and can either approve or reject them. If the Federation Council rejects a bill passed by the State Duma, the two chambers must form a conciliation commission to work out a compromise version of the legislation. If two chambers cannot reach a compromise, or the Duma insists on passing the bill &quot;as is&quot;, the veto of the Federation Council can be overridden, if two thirds of the Duma&#x27;s constitutional composition vote in favor of the bill.

The State Duma and the Federation Council usually meet separately. Joint sessions are organized when:

*President of Russia delivers his annual address to the Federal Assembly;
*For hearing of addresses of the Constitutional Court of Russia;
*To hear the speeches of leaders of foreign States.

==Parliamentary centre==
In the mid 2000s it was suggested that the Parliamentary centre of the State Duma and Federation Council be combined into one building. In 2012, the idea was supported by President Dmitry Medvedev. Reasons cited for the construction of a new building included the cramped nature of the parliament members&#x27; current offices, the remote locations of these offices split across ten locations in Moscow, and the desire of the government to move the bodies away from the city centre to reduce traffic congestion.

Various areas of Moscow were examined to serve as the new parliamentary center: Kutuzovsky Avenue, Frunzenskaya Embankment, &quot;Moscow City&quot;, Tushino airfield, Krasnaya Presnya Street, Moskvoretskaya Embankment, Muzeon Park of Arts and the Sofia Embankment. In September 2014, the Mnyovniki floodplain was selected, a decision which was protested by ecologists.

The design of the new building was to be decided on the basis of an architectural competition. The parliamentarians, however, disagreed on aesthetic decisions between candidates in the competition, which were not resolved when the contest was conducted a second time.

Financing issues caused complications. Originally, the Parliamentary center was to be funded by private investors, who would in turn receive ownership of a building currently belonging to the State Duma and the Federation Council, as well as permits to tear it down and replace the building with their own development projects (such as hotels). An objection to this plan was lodged by architectural critic Grigory Revzin, arguing that the State Duma is located in the building of the Council of Labor and Defense which was designed by Arkady Langman and built in 1935, rendering the existing State Duma building an architectural monument, which would be protected by the state and cannot be demolished.

Work on the parliamentary center was to begin in 2020. However, in 2016 it was postponed to an unknown date due to the economic situation and disagreements on what the center should look like.

<doc id="1268572" wikidata="Q355392" url="?curid=1268572" title="Angus Macfadyen">
<text>Angus Macfadyen (born 1963) is a Scottish actor. His roles include Robert the Bruce, both in &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Robert the Bruce&quot;, Komodo in &quot;Warriors of Virtue&quot;, Vice-Counsel Dupont in &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, Jeff Denlon in the &quot;Saw&quot; franchise, Robert Rogers in the AMC historical drama &quot;&quot;, McCreedy in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;We Bought a Zoo,&quot; and biologist James Murray in &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot;. He has made appearances on several television series such as &quot;Californication&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;Chuck&quot;, and &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;.

==Early life==
Macfadyen was brought up in the Philippines, Africa, Singapore and France. His father was a doctor in the World Health Organization. Macfadyen attended the University of Edinburgh and the Central School of Speech and Drama in London.

==Career==
===1990s===
Macfadyen&#x27;s first role was Philip in the film made for television &quot;The Lost Language of Cranes&quot; (1991). He portrayed a young man who must tell his parents that he is gay. Playing the role of his father was fellow Scottish actor Brian Cox. Macfadyen then acted in five episodes of &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot; before appearing in the television film &quot;15: The Life and Death of Philip Knight&quot; (1993) and also on the television series &quot;Takin&#x27; Over the Asylum&quot; (1994) about a salesman who runs a radio station in a mental institution. That role led to his role as Robert the Bruce in Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995). In 1995 he also portrayed Richard Burton in the TV miniseries &quot;&quot;.

After &quot;Braveheart&quot; won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, Macfadyen acted in the independent film &quot;Nevada&quot; (1997), before giving the most over-the-top performance of his career in the action/fantasy &quot;Warriors of Virtue&quot; (1997). He also co-starred alongside Don Cheadle and Ray Liotta when he played Peter Lawford in the HBO film &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; (1998).

Macfadyen played Orson Welles in Tim Robbins&#x27;s third directorial film &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999). Although the film received a nomination for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes, it was a financial flop. Macfadyen next made the Shakespearan film &quot;Titus&quot; (1999), alongside Anthony Hopkins, where he played Lucius, eldest son of Titus Andronicus. Directed by Julie Taymor, the film was a critical triumph but with mediocre box office results.

===2000s===
After the noir film &quot;Second Skin&quot; (2000), Macfadyen acted in a number of poorly received films. One such film was the action film &quot;Styx&quot; (2001) which starred Peter Weller. A year later, he acted in the comedy film &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; (2002) alongside a number of famous names: Sandra Bullock, Ellen Burstyn, Maggie Smith and Ashley Judd. That same year, Macfadyen took the role of Vice-Counsel Dupont in &quot;Equilibrium&quot; (also 2002). The film, also starring Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs and Emily Watson, is set in the future, where a fascist regime forbids all emotions.

Macfadyen acted as Marcus Crassus in a TV mini-series of &quot;Spartacus&quot; (2004), and the character of Bill in &quot;The Pleasure Drivers&quot; (2005).

In 2006, he was the lead in the dramatic film &quot;The Virgin of Juarez&quot; (2006). He then starred in Kevin Connor&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, it co-stars Richard Chamberlain, Jessica Chastain, Mark Umbers, Stacy Keach, David Winters, and Rachel Ward. It&#x27;s about pirate Blackbeard (Macfadyen), who wreaks havoc on the high-seas looking for Captain Kidd&#x27;s treasure. His dark presence causes controversy in the local port town of New Providence, especially among Gov. Charles Eden (Chamberlain) and his adopted daughter Charlotte (Chastain), who is being wooed by Lt. Robert Maynard (Umbers).

His next big role was that of Jeff Denlon in &quot;Saw III&quot; (also 2006). Jeff is a man obsessed with revenge, and he is led into a series of traps that test his ability to forgive. The film was a smash hit for its $10 million budget, earning almost $200 million worldwide. Macfadyen then co-starred in the box office bomb &quot;Redline&quot; and &quot;Saw IV&quot; (both 2007), which was also a box office success.

Macfadyen continued making films, starring as the outlaw Will Tunney in his western film &quot;Shadowheart&quot; (2009). He has appeared on television on the series &quot;Killer Wave&quot; (2007) and &quot;Californication&quot; (2008) He has also acted in the mystery film &quot;San Saba&quot; (2008) and the thriller film &quot;Clean Break&quot; (aka, &quot;Unnatural Causes&quot;, 2008).

===2010s===
Macfadyen has appeared in two thrillers: &quot;Pound of Flesh&quot; (2010) alongside Malcolm McDowell, which revolves around a corrupt college professor, and the crime thriller &quot;Shadows of the White Nights&quot; (aka, &quot;Assassins Run&quot;, 2013) alongside Christian Slater. He starred as Lucas Blackstone in the Christian film &quot;Taken by Grace&quot; (also 2013). Additionally, Macfadyen was part of the cast of the USA Network&#x27;s television series &quot;Psych&quot;, the Cameron Crowe feature film &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot; (2011) starring Matt Damon, and the final season of &quot;Chuck&quot; as villain Nicholas Quinn.

Macfadyen also starred as Robert Rogers in AMC&#x27;s historical drama series &quot;&quot; (2014–17), and Allan Pinkerton on the first-run syndicated series &quot;The Pinkertons&quot; (2014–15). &quot;Macbeth: Unhinged&quot; (2016) is a modernised feature-length film adapted from the Shakespearean play in which he stars and directs. He appeared opposite Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson as biologist James Murray in the 2016 biographical drama &quot;The Lost City of Z.&quot;

In 2021, Macfadyen was cast as Jor-El in &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;.

<doc id="1268574" wikidata="Q4908086" url="?curid=1268574" title="Bill Beeny">
<text>Bill Beeny (July 1, 1926 – January 19, 2022) was a Baptist minister and self-declared segregationist who led organizations in St. Louis, Missouri, during the 1960s. More recently he had worked to popularize his theory that the American singer Elvis Presley was still living.

==Early years==
Beeny, whose father died when he was nine years old, was one of five children. During his late teens and early twenties, he worked as a tavern porter and manager in Eldorado, Illinois, the hometown of the woman he married at age eighteen. Beeny battled recurrent tuberculosis as a young man; during one painful recuperation, as he later explained, he &quot;got disgusted with my life and was converted to the Christian faith.&quot; He was ordained by the Southern Baptist Convention in 1947, and during the 1950s he attended Shurtleff College in Alton, Illinois and the American Divinity School in Chicago, Illinois.

==Political and ministerial career==
Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s, Beeny based himself in St. Louis, where he was active in domestic anti-communist campaigns and led local and national efforts directed against civil-rights and student-movement leaders. In 1961, Beeny picketed Washington University in St. Louis, urging the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities to investigate his allegations of communist &quot;infiltration&quot; among university faculty – especially those who had signed a nuclear-test-ban petition organized by California chemist and Nobel laureate Linus Pauling. He also participated in national petition drives urging the Committee to investigate the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Black Panthers.

Beeny&#x27;s political and religious radio broadcasts, which began with one station in Alton, Illinois, were eventually heard on dozens of stations across the country. At the same time, the minister operated an &quot;anti-communist&quot; youth ranch in Wright City, Missouri; the ranch, according to Beeny&#x27;s claim, drew upwards of 1,500 campers per summer during the early 1960s. Beeny faced constant legal problems over questionable financial practices at his Missouri Youth Ranch and his Denver-area radio station &quot;The Voice of Reason.&quot; In 1960, accusations of marital infidelity forced Beeny from his position as pastor of the New Testament Baptist Church, which he had founded in a St. Louis storefront five years earlier. Lawsuits over an allegedly fraudulent bond issue to finance his ranch and broadcasting operations soon followed. After his resignation, Beeny took up the pastorship of the St. Louis Baptist Temple, a position he would hold until 1969.

Beeny organized Missouri rallies in support of the Vietnam War through the 1960s. In 1966, the minister formed the Counter-Revolutionary Organization on Salvation and Service (CROSS), with chapters in Miami, Florida and St. Louis. Working out of Beeny&#x27;s Baptist church at 4249 Gibson Avenue, CROSS&#x27;s St. Louis chapter organized several controversial &quot;home-defense&quot; seminars. The meetings were intended to instruct members in fire-arms and survivalist tactics in order to fend off what Beeny called &quot;those so-called civil-rights groups now reported to be stocking weapons&quot; in preparation for a revolutionary uprising.

Running for Missouri Lieutenant-Governor as a Democrat in 1968 – one of his many unsuccessful bids for state and local office – Beeny endorsed the presidential campaign of the then-segregationist Alabama Governor George C. Wallace. Beeny&#x27;s own campaign platform, as outlined in his newsletter &quot;The Herald of Missouri&quot;, urged &quot;states&#x27; rights,&quot; opposed open-housing legislation and busing for school integration, and advocated a &quot;tough-on-crime&quot; policy that would include ordering police to &quot;shoot to kill&quot; in response to civil disorders.

Beeny also recorded gospel music and played it with a father/daughter duo, Ora and Gwen Gaulden of St. Louis, Missouri.

==Elvis Presley-related work==
The minister relocated to Wright City, Missouri, in 1969 after a fire at his St. Louis church. There, he operated a general store and more recently sought to popularize his theory that the American singer Elvis Presley, who died in 1977, was still living. Beeny was owner of The 50s Cafe, which was packed with 1950s memorabilia focusing mainly on Presley and Marilyn Monroe. Beeny also founded the Elvis is Alive Museum in his Wright City store space in 1992, and, in 2005, he published his book &quot;Elvis&#x27; DNA Proves He&#x27;s Alive&quot;. Beeny maintained a website dedicated to Presley and to his own museum. Beeny also resumed broadcasts of pre-recorded religious, political and Elvis Presley-related content, this time via the internet.

In October 2007, Bill Beeny placed the entire contents of his museum and his two websites on sale on eBay, as one lot. The sale attracted attention from national news outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and National Public Radio. The sale ended November 8, with a winning bid of $8,300 placed by Andy Key of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Key reopened the museum in Hattiesburg, but in September 2008 Key was called up for National Guard duty and, unable to continue running the museum, he attempted to sell the collection on eBay. Failing to find a buyer, Key put it into storage. Meanwhile, according to the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, Beeny turned the museum&#x27;s former home into a mission center and food bank helping poor and hungry people. In April 2009, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; reported that Beeny&#x27;s mission center had been burgled, with the perpetrator stealing the computer used to run Beeny&#x27;s streaming online Christian radio station.

<text>The Federation Council, unofficially Senate, is the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, the lower house being the State Duma. It was established by the Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993.

Each of the 89 federal subjects of Russia (including two annexed in 2014 and four more in 2022, which are not recognized by the international community), consisting of 24 republics, 48 oblasts, nine krais, three federal cities, four autonomous okrugs, and one autonomous oblast, sends two senators to the Council, for a total membership of 178 Senators. In addition, the Constitution also provides for senators from the Russian Federation, which can be no more than 30 (up to seven of them for life), as well as (optionally) former presidents as life senators ( there are no such life senators).

The council holds its sessions within the Main Building on Bolshaya Dmitrovka Street in Moscow, the former home of the Soviet State Building Agency (Gosstroy), with further offices and committee rooms located on New Arbat Avenue. The two houses of the Federal Assembly are physically separated, with the State Duma residing in another part of Moscow on Okhotny Ryad Street. Sessions of the Federation Council take place in Moscow from 25 January to 15 July and from 16 September to 31 December. Sessions are open to the public, although the location of sessions can change if the Federation Council so desires, and secure closed sessions may be convoked.

For purposes of succession, the speaker (chairman) of the Federation Council is the third-highest position in the Russian Federation, after the president and the prime minister. In the case of incapacity of the president and prime minister, the chairman of the Federation Council becomes the Acting President of the Russian Federation.

==History==
The modern history of the Federation Council begins during the 1993 Constitutional Crisis that pitted President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s unpopular neoliberal and governmental structure reforms against the increasingly radical Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies, the nation&#x27;s legislature. Throughout the year, the congress had grown increasingly dissatisfied with Yeltsin and his cabinet&#x27;s management of the floundering Russian economy, as well as with its plans for a new constitution for the Russian Federation to replace the Soviet-era 1978 Russian SFSR Constitution still in effect. Amidst the increasingly tense crisis, on 21 September, Yeltsin issued Presidential Decree No.1400. The decree effectively scrapped constitutional reform then in discussion, as well as legally dissolving the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies, ordering its replacement with an entirely new federal legislative structure, and granting the president increased executive powers. Following a war of words and acts of defiance from both sides, President Yeltsin abruptly ended the governmental power struggle by ordering the Russian army to bombard and storm the White House of Russia, the legislative building, between 2–4 October 1993.

Following the crushing of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and other members of the federal and territorial governments who had initially supported what he viewed as a rebellious legislature, Yeltsin presented a new constitution. With the events of 1993 very much in mind, Yeltsin drafted a constitution that called for increased executive branch powers in prime ministerial appointments, veto overrides, and a stronger executive security council. The constitution also called for the creation of a bicameral Federal Assembly, consisting of a State Duma and a Federation Council. Although Yeltsin had created a Federation Council in July 1993 to gather regional representatives (except Chechnya) to support an earlier draft of a replacement constitution to the 1978 document, this Federation Council was to become a permanent part of the legislature.

The procedure of the formation of the Federation Council through elections held according to a majority system was defined by Presidential Decrees No. 1626, to take effect from 11 October 1993, &quot;On Elections to the Council of Federation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation&quot; and No. 1846, from 6 November 1993, &quot;On Specification to the Resolution on Elections of Deputies to the State Duma and Resolution on Elections of Deputies to the Council of Federation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation in 1993&quot;.

Similar to the United States Senate, the Federation Council would consist of two representatives from each of Russia&#x27;s federal subjects. Unlike the State Duma, which consisted of representatives from hundreds of districts nationwide, the Federation Council was to act as more or less the voice of Russia&#x27;s federated subdivisions. Early debate on its creation centered on whether or not the Federation Council should be elected at all. To solve some problems on the Council&#x27;s first scheduled election in December, Yeltsin issued Presidential Decree No. 1628, on 11 October, stipulating that candidates for the first elections needed at least two percent, or 25,000 signatures—whichever was highest—of their oblast, republic, krai, autonomous okrug, or federal city population. This helped previous territorial elites remain within national politics. The decree also stipulated a single term of two years before new elections in 1995.

The Council&#x27;s first elections were held on 12 December 1993, simultaneously with State Duma elections and a referendum on the new Constitution of the Russian Federation. With the constitution now in effect after its successful passage, elections for the Council were to be franchised solely to territorial authorities, with one senator elected from the subject&#x27;s legislature, and the other by the subject&#x27;s executive branch. This was later codified in 1995 when the Council&#x27;s first term expired.

The constitution, however, did not specify senators were to be elected. By 1995, using this constitutional anomaly, regional executives could sit &quot;ex officio&quot; in both their regional executive posts within the Federation Council. While the State Duma held many of the serious debates on Russian policy during this time, the Council became a lobby for regional interests, competing for federal attention.

The ascension of President Vladimir Putin following Yeltsin&#x27;s resignation on 31 December 1999 brought many new changes to the Federation Council. As part of his top political goals in his first months of office in 2000, Putin proposed a reform law to change the makeup of the Council, which would allow regional governors to designate councillors but not sit on the Council themselves, freeing it from what Putin saw as blatant personal cronyism on the part of regional leaders. The Council furiously resisted Putin&#x27;s plan, conscious that their role in federal politics, their very ability to enjoy the fruits of living within Moscow, and their parliamentary immunity would end. With the State Duma threatening to override a Council veto, and Putin&#x27;s threats to open federal criminal investigations against regional governors, the Council backed down and grudgingly supported the law in July 2000. Consequently, a wave of new Kremlin-friendly senators took the vacated seats, with the full backing of Putin. The last of the dual senator-governors were rotated out of office in early 2002.

Following the Beslan school hostage crisis in September 2004, President Putin initiated a radical shakeup of the federal system, proposing that the direct elections of regional governors be replaced by appointments by the president himself. These appointments could later be confirmed or rejected by the regional legislatures. The move further placed more control over the Council by the executive branch, due to laws that stipulate that regional executives have a say in choosing delegates to the Federation Council.

Since 2000, the Federation Council has largely remained a stable body. However, critics have charged that Putin&#x27;s tactics in reforming the Council were blatantly undemocratic and anti-federal, arguing that the reforms created a rubber stamp body for the executive branch and the ruling United Russia party, similar to what the Soviet of Nationalities was during the Soviet period.

==Officers and members==
As set in Article 101 of the Russian Constitution, the Federation Council &quot;shall elect among its deputies the chairman of the Council.&quot; Some of the Chairman&#x27;s official duties include presiding over sessions, formulating and introducing draft agendas, issuing orders and consulting with the Council&#x27;s various committees, acting as the Council&#x27;s official representative in the Federal Assembly, and signing resolutions to be forwarded to the president or the State Duma.

The current chairwoman is Valentina Matviyenko.

Senators can retain membership in their respective parties. However, they are asked not to bring party factionalism to the floor itself. Since the reforms of 2000, the Council has enjoyed a significantly close relationship with the Kremlin, helping to pass key legislation the Kremlin desires.

According to Article 98, all the members of the Council enjoy immunity from arrest, detainment, and searches. In 2007 the law regarding the Federation Council was amended, and now a senator must have resided for at least ten years in the territory being represented.

The Federal Law defines the status of members of the Federation Council: &quot;On Status of Members of the Council of Federation and Status of Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation&quot;.

=== Presidium ===
The presidium consists of a chairman, four deputy chairmen, and a general secretary.

===Political affiliation===
Unlike the State Duma, with its division of parties and leaders, in 2002 parliamentary groups were forbidden, following Mironov&#x27;s election to the chairmanship and the parliamentary procedures to disband all political factions, though the senators are affiliated with some major Russian political parties.

==Elections==
Unlike the State Duma and the provincial legislatures throughout Russia, the Council is not directly elected but instead is chosen by territorial politicians, resembling in some respects the structure of the U.S. Senate before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. The only exclusion to this was the first Federation council (1994–1996), which was elected on 12 December 1993.

According to Article 95, the Council comprises representatives of each Russian federal subject—two from each. The provincial legislature elects one senator, and the other is nominated by the provincial governor and confirmed by the legislature. Before 2000, all provincial governors and heads of provincial legislatures were also members of the Council. Upon President Putin&#x27;s ascension to the Russian presidency, this practice was discontinued under pressure from the Kremlin, forbidding governors to hold dual posts.

Terms of membership in the Council are also not nationally fixed, due to the continuing territorial nature of the chamber. Terms are determined according to the regional bodies they represent.

In 2001–2004 regional bodies were able to recall their senator by the same procedure by which they appointed them. Such recalls once occurred quite often. But a new law passed in December 2004 required that the chairman of the Federation Council must first initiate a recall procedure. The procedure has not been used since.

On 1 January 2013, the latest Law on the Procedure to Form the Federation Council entered into force: according to the Law, the Federation Council consists of two delegates from each Russian constituent component, one representing the given region&#x27;s legislative assembly and the other representing the provincial executive authorities. There will be two different election procedures, one for each member type. (Federal Law No. 229, art. 1.1.) A candidate for the Senator from a constituent component&#x27;s legislature must be a member of the component region&#x27;s legislative assembly. Candidates are nominated by the chairman of the regional legislative assembly, by one party faction represented in the assembly, or by at least one-fifth of the assembly members. Then, the regional legislative assembly will vote to elect one of the nominated candidates.

An amendment to the law was approved in July 2014, which added 17 more senators who are nominated by the president.

The regional executive authority representative, the second type of delegate to the Federation Council, is appointed by the governor of that constituent component (or the head of that autonomous republic). The delegate is selected from among three people named by the candidates for the office of governor/head of the concerned region. The winner of the gubernatorial/republican leadership election then appoints one of the three delegates previously named for appointment to the Council as a senator from said region.

==Powers==
The Federation Council is viewed as the more formal chamber of the Federal Assembly. Because of its federalist design and its voting franchise being strictly limited to provincial elites, the Council is viewed as less susceptible to radical changes.

The Council is charged with cooperating with the State Duma in completing and voting on draft laws. Federal laws concerning budgets, customs regulations, credit monitoring, and the ratification of international treaties are to be considered by the Council after they have been adopted by the State Duma, where most legislation is introduced.

Special powers that are accorded only to senators of the Federation Council are:

* Approval of changes in borders between the federal subjects of the Russian Federation;
* Approval of a decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of martial law;
* Approval of a decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of a state of emergency;
* Deciding on the possibility of using the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation outside the territory of the Russian Federation;
* Declaring of elections of the President of the Russian Federation;
* Impeachment of the President of the Russian Federation;
* Approving the president&#x27;s nomination of judges of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and of the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federal government;
* Approving the president&#x27;s nomination of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation;
* Appointment of Deputy Chairman and half of the auditors of the Accounting Chamber.

For laws to pass the Federation Council, a vote of more than half of its 178 senators is required. When considering federal constitutional laws, three-fourths of the Council&#x27;s votes are required for passage. If the Council vetoes a law passed by the State Duma, the two chambers are mandated to form a Conciliation Committee in order to form a compromise bill, on which both houses would have to vote again. A two-thirds majority of Duma deputies can override the Federation Council&#x27;s veto.

==Committees==

Committees form a key component of the structure of the Council. Sixteen committees and seven commissions exist for senators to consider legislation and policy on several issues ranging from foreign affairs, federal affairs, and youth and sports. Leadership in these committees are determined by the Council Chairman, who remains in correspondence with their findings. These committees include:

* Committee on Constitutional Legislation
* Committee on Judicial and Legal Affairs
* Committee on Defence and Security
* Budgetary Committee
* Committee on Financial Markets and Currency Circulation
* Foreign Affairs Committee
* Committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States
* Committee on Federal Affairs and Regional Policies
* Committee on Local Government
* Social Policy Committee
* Committee on Economic Policy, Business and Ownership
* Industrial Policy Committee
* Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Protection
* Committee on Food and Agricultural Policies
* Committee for Science, Culture, Education, Public Health and Ecology
* Committee on Northern Territories and Indigenous Minorities
* Commission on Standing Orders and Parliamentary Performance Organisation
* Commission for the Council of Federation&#x27;s Performance Maintenance Monitoring
* Commission on Ways and Means of the Council of Federation&#x27;s Constitutional Powers Implementation
* Commission for Interaction with the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation
* Commission on Youth and Sports
* Commission on Information Policy
* Commission on Natural Monopolies

==Chairpeople of the Federation Council==

* Vladimir Shumeyko (13 January 1994 – 23 January 1996)
* Yegor Stroyev (23 January 1996 – 5 December 2001)
* Sergey Mironov (5 December 2001 – 18 May 2011)
** Aleksander Torshin (19 May – 21 September 2011) (acting)

<text>Ponevezh Yeshiva (), often pronounced as Ponevitch Yeshiva (), is a yeshiva founded in 1919 in Panevėžys (Ponevezh), Lithuania, and located in Bnei Brak, Israel since 1944. The yeshiva has over three thousand students, including those of affiliated institutions.

It is considered one of the leading Litvish (non-hassidic ultra-orthodox) yeshivas in Israel.

==History==
Founded in 1919, the yeshiva was originally located in city of Panevėžys (Ponevezh), Lithuania before the Holocaust. After the death of its founder, Yitzhak Yaakov Rabinovich, the yeshiva was re-established in Bnei Brak in 1944 by Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, who appointed Shmuel Rozovsky as dean, and some years later appointed Dovid Povarsky as &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot;.

The main study hall has an original 16th-century Italian wooden &quot;aron kodesh&quot; (Torah scroll ark), brought to the yeshiva in the early 1980s, and restored and re-gilded with 22 carat gild leaf.

== Split into two factions ==
During the 1990s, leadership of the yeshiva was the subject of a public disagreement between two of its leaders. Since then, the yeshiva has split and resulted in two yeshivas in the same building, with the students occupying different dormitories, though studying in the same learning hall and eating in the same dining room.

The Kahaneman faction of the yeshiva was led by rabbi Gershon Eidelstein and is led by rabbis Berel Povarsky (son of Dovid Povarsky), Reb Dovid Levy (son-in-law of Rabbi Eidelstein and Reb Chaim Peretz Berman (a grandson of The Steipler, and a son-in-law of Reb Berel Povarsky). The Markovitz faction of the yeshiva is led by Reb Shmuel Markovitz and The Mashgiach Reb Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, who led together with Reb Asher Deutch until his death in 2024.

<text>The Macau national football team (; ) represents the Chinese special administrative region of Macau in international association football. The team is supervised by the Macau Football Association (; Portuguese: &quot;Associação de Futebol de Macau&quot;). The Macau football team has a ranking that is one of the lowest among the FIFA members.

The national team has never qualified for the AFC Asian Cup or EAFF East Asian Championship. The team qualified for the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup, where they got one draw and two losses.

The team had been representing Macau in international football events before 1999 when Macau was a dependent territory of Portugal. It continues to represent Macau even after Macau was handed over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China by Portugal and became a special administrative region of China in 1999. This team is separate from the China national football team, as the Basic Law and the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; allows Macau to maintain its own representative teams in international sports competitions. In Macau, the Macau football team is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Macau team&quot; (), while the Chinese national team is referred to as the &quot;national team&quot; ().

== History ==
Macau participated in the inaugural 2006 AFC Challenge Cup held in Bangladesh being grouped with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan but lost all of their match against their opponent.

Macau then participated in the inaugural 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup held in Kuching, Malaysia being grouped with Laos, Mongolia and Sri Lanka. In the first match, Macau won Mongolia 2–1 with captain, Niki Torrão scoring a brace. The following match, Macau won Laos 4–1 before eventually drawing to Sri Lanka 1–1 which see Macau advanced to the semi-finals as group leaders. Macau faced Brunei which Leong Ka Hang rescued Macau from a one goal deficit to level the match at 1–1 seeing both sides off to extra time however the match goes on to penalties shoot out with Macau advancing to their first even international cup final. On 15 November 2016, Macau faced Nepal however in the 29&#x27; minute of the match, Nepalese Sujal Shrestha break the deadlock and Nepal ended up winning the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup at the Sarawak Stadium. Leong Ka Hang is given the tournament &#x27;Most Valuable Player&#x27; and Niki Torrão as the top joint goal scorer with 4 goals.

During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification against Sri Lanka in which they won the first tie 1–0, they forfeited the second tie which awarded Sri Lanka was awarded as a 3–0 victory to Sri Lanka after Macau did not send their team for the match due to safety reasons following the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings. After a 4 years hiatus from the COVID-19 pandemic, On 26 March 2023, Macau play their first ever international matches at their own ground,Estádio Campo Desportivo against Singapore in a 1–0 defeat. On 19 June 2023, Macau travelled to Dalian, China to face Myanmar in a friendly match. Since their returned to international football, Macau mostly played against Southeast Asian country like Cambodia and Brunei.
In August 2024, all non-Chinese nationals listed to play for the Macau Football Association became ineligible for the team under FIFA Congress&#x27;s adoption to a rule amendment made in 18 September 2020. The players affected include Vitor Almeida, Iuri Capelo, captain Nicholas Torrão, and Filipe Duarte, as well as a fifth player who was about to join up.

<doc id="1268599" wikidata="Q378767" url="?curid=1268599" title="Adtranz">
<text>Adtranz was a multi-national rail transportation equipment manufacturer with facilities concentrated in Europe and the US. The company, legally known as ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation, was created in 1996 as a joint venture between ABB and Daimler-Benz to combine their rail equipment manufacturing operations. In 1999, DaimlerChrysler (successor to Daimler-Benz) bought ABB&#x27;s shares and changed the company&#x27;s official name to DaimlerChrysler Rail Systems. The company was acquired by Bombardier in 2001, which merged it into its Bombardier Transportation division, which became the largest rail equipment manufacturer in the world at the time, and was ultimately acquired by Alstom in 2021.

Adtranz manufactured locomotives, high-speed, regional, metro and underground passenger trains, trams and people movers as well as freight wagons. Non-rolling stock businesses included railway electrification and signalling infrastructure.

== History ==
On 8 May 1995, ABB and Daimler-Benz proposed a merger of their rail industry-related activities into a single autonomous 50:50 joint venture; the combined group would be the largest rail-technology company in the world. In Germany the combined company, along with Siemens would have a duopoly or near-duopoly in the market areas of electric locomotives, mainline and regional electric and diesel multiple units, trams and metros, and catenary systems. In the EU, outside Germany, the merger would have meant no significant market share increase, including Scandinavia, where ABB had a dominant market share. The proposed merger was approved by government regulators on 18 October 1995, on the condition that both companies divest themselves of any shares in Kiepe, a traction components company. The merger came into force on 1 January 1996.

The company&#x27;s manufacturing facilities and product lines were rationalised, including a standard form of car body; after 18 months manufacturing costs had been reduced by 30%, revenues and orders also rose from 1996 to 1997. However the company continued to lose money, $111 million in 1997. Polish manufacturer Pafawag was acquired in 1997 and the facility modernised, controlling interests in &quot;MÁV Dunakeszi&quot;, Hungary and &quot;Schindler Waggon&quot; Switzerland were also acquired by the end of 1997.In March 1998 Adtranz presented a set of new product brands for modular product platforms, with designs that can be adapted for the specific requirements of different customers: the &quot;Innovia&quot; guided transport vehicle, the &quot;Incentro&quot; low floor tram, the &quot;Itino&quot; diesel multiple unit, the &quot;Crusaris&quot; medium-high speed train (based on the GMB Class 71 &quot;flytoget&quot; trains), and the &quot;Octeon&quot; electric locomotive. A new diesel locomotive design with engine and electrical traction system provided by General Electric was introduced, named &quot;Blue Tiger&quot;. Adtranz intended to consolidate its product range around these families once on-going deliveries are finished.

Adtranz continued to make an operating loss in 1998, attributed to earlier contracts with underestimated costs, as well as technical problems with products. The same year brought an order for 400 locomotives for Deutsche Bahn, as well as the acquisition of Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works.

ABB sold its 50% stake in Adtranz to DaimlerChrysler in January 1999 for $472 million, taking up a previous agreement made on the formation of the joint venture whereby DaimlerChrysler was required to purchase ABB&#x27;s stake.

Adtranz finally achieved profitability in 2000, as DaimlerChrysler prepared to sell off Adtranz. The Greenbrier Companies acquired the freight wagon manufacturing business in January 2000. The overhead electrification systems installations business was sold to Balfour Beatty in late 2000 for €153 million. No buyer was found for the railway signalling division.

The remaining assets of Adtranz were sold to Bombardier, in a $711 million deal announced in August 2000, a price considered to be low by industry analysts. The sale was cleared by the European Union in April 2001 on the condition that Bombardier would license or sell the Adtranz regional train and tram products to Stadler Rail in the German market, due to the large market share of Bombardier and Adtranz in the country. The deal would make Stadler a viable independent company providing competition to Bombardier. The takeover came into legal effect on 1 May 2001 with a final price of $725 million and ADtranz was folded into the Bombardier Transportation division.

Within months of the sale, Bombardier said that it was misled about the financial situation of Adtranz. Bombardier sued DaimlerChrysler for providing misleading financial information. The companies settled in September 2004 with DaimlerChrysler agreeing to refund $209 million, making the final sale price for Adtranz just $516 million.

=== Brand ===

The brand &quot;Adtranz&quot; was created by Landor Associates as part of the corporate identity of &quot;ABB Daimler Benz Transportation&quot;. It is an acronym derived from selected letters of the complete name of the first company using it: &quot;A&quot;BB &quot;D&quot;aimler-Benz &quot;Trans&quot;portation, with a &quot;z&quot; in place of an &quot;s&quot; at the end for the name to imply a complete product platform from A to Z. It was capitalised by the companies with a capital &quot;D&quot; as &quot;ADtranz&quot;, following the standard English text formatting and capitalisation rules it is spelled with a small &quot;d&quot; as &quot;Adtranz&quot;. Above the text &quot;ADtranz&quot;, the company logo included a green dot, symbolising a signal set on green, as well as the environmental friendliness of railways. The company also registered the slogan &quot;ADtranz – we speak railways&quot;. Rights on the brand and slogan were deleted in 2008 and 2007 respectively.

<doc id="1268600" wikidata="Q1818121" url="?curid=1268600" title="Paris (Supertramp album)">
<text>Paris is a live album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in 1980. It was recorded on Supertramp&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; tour in Paris, France, with most of the tracks taken from a 29 November 1979 show at the Pavillon de Paris, a venue which was once a slaughterhouse. The album was originally going to be called &quot;Roadworks&quot;. &quot;Paris&quot; reached number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in late 1980 and went Gold immediately, while the live version of &quot;Dreamer&quot; hit the US Top 20.

==Background and recording==
According to Roger Hodgson, Supertramp had several reasons to record a live album at the time, including a desire to introduce their pre-&quot;Breakfast in America&quot; works to US listeners and a mutual sentiment that some of their songs were pulled off better live than in the studio. However, he admits that the chief purpose of the album was to buy time; the band was under pressure to produce a suitable follow-up to the immense success of &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, and needed to get off the treadmill of touring and recording for a while in order to consider their direction for such an album. Taking such a breather meant the next studio album wouldn&#x27;t be finished until 1981 at the earliest, and so something was needed &quot;to fill the gap.&quot;

Using the band&#x27;s mobile studio, a number of shows in Canada and throughout Europe were recorded. However, when Pete Henderson and Russel Pope presented the band with unlabeled cassettes containing rough mixes of these recordings, and the members voted on their favourite tracks, the majority of votes coincidentally fell on recordings from the 29 November show at the Pavilion. A few tracks were taken from other concerts during the band&#x27;s stay in Paris, and studio overdubs were also added, chiefly for the vocals and John Helliwell&#x27;s organ. However, Helliwell contended that the amount of overdubbing was minimal compared to most live albums of the time: &quot;A lot of people, when they make a live album, just keep the drums and bass and redo everything else.&quot; Filmmaker Derek Burbidge shot the concerts in 16 mm film, missing only five songs (&quot;A Soapbox Opera&quot;, &quot;You Started Laughing&quot;, &quot;From Now On&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody But Me&quot; and &quot;Downstream&quot;) to lower expenses and give the camera crew some rest. A&amp;M Records requested music videos out of three songs, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;The Logical Song&quot; and &quot;Asylum&quot;. Peter Clifton edited them along with Sarah Legon, and even extended his work to ten songs. However, the studio never sent an approval, so Clifton retreated back to his Sydney home and brought the negatives along to Australia.

The album&#x27;s set list contains almost all of the 1974 &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (except for &quot;If Everyone Was Listening&quot;), three songs from &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; (1975), two from &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot; (1977), three from &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; (1979) plus &quot;You Started Laughing&quot;, the B-side to the track &quot;Lady&quot; from &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot;. The hit &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; was played on the tour but not included because, according to Hodgson, &quot;we were shocked when we listened back to the live tapes to find how bad all the versions were. There just wasn&#x27;t one version that we felt that we wanted to put on the album.&quot; Other songs that were on the tour&#x27;s set list but not on the album are &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments&quot;, &quot;Downstream&quot;, &quot;Child of Vision&quot; and &quot;Another Man&#x27;s Woman&quot;. All of these tracks, including &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, later showed up on the second live disc included in the deluxe anniversary edition of &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; and on the 2-CD/DVD set &quot;Live in Paris &#x27;79&quot;.

==Remastering and DVD release==


In July 2006, the original master tapes of the album were rediscovered in the Northern California barn of the band&#x27;s drummer Bob Siebenberg, along with video footage. The tapes were sent to Cups &#x27;N Strings Studios in Woodland Hills, California, for digital remastering. The tapes were initially in bad technical shape, but were successfully transferred to a digital format.

In 2010, Clifton was contacted to finish editing the initial three videos, aiming to later release a concert film out of the Paris concert. The footage was delivered to Roger Hodgson before a concert in Sydney. Once Supertramp manager Dave Margereson and Eagle Rock Entertainment offered to cover the post-production costs, Clifton worked on finishing the film, doing his initial work in Australia. By the time he moved to London to conclude the project, Clifton found out his original idea to feature heavily footage of Paris, adding a story akin to his work in &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, was nixed by the band, who edited most of what he had done without consent to instead showcase more of the group. The sound was remixed by Peter Henderson and Supertramp&#x27;s original sound engineer Russel Pope from the original multi-tracks.

The concert film was released on 27 August 2012 under the title &quot;Live in Paris &#x27;79&quot;, with editions in both DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Hodgson would later express his disapproval with the finished project, saying the rest of the band made most decisions regarding the DVD without asking his input and avoiding giving correct songwriting credit to himself or Davies. The DVD was repackaged in 2015 with the full show on two CDs and correct songwriting credit on the rear packaging.

<text>Kovno Kollel also known as Kollel Perushim of Kovno or Kollel Knesses Beis Yitzchok, was a &quot;kollel&quot; located in Kaunas, Lithuania. It was founded in 1877 by Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter when he was 67.

Kovno Kollel&#x27;s purpose was the furtherance of &quot;hora&#x27;ah&quot; (expertise in deciding matters of Jewish law) and &quot;musar&quot; - by supporting and guiding exceptional Torah scholars in their development as authorities. 

==History==
In 1877, Rabbi Yisroel ben Ze’ev Wolf Lipkin – also known as Yisroel Salanter – founded a Kollel (a yeshiva for young, mostly married, men) in the city of Kaunes (Kovno), Lithuania.

The Kollel taught the non-Hasidic Orthodox Musar movement (of which Lipkin was the founder) that sought to emphasize ethical conduct and spiritual devotion.

The project was approved by, and eventually named for, Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, the rabbi of Kovno.

When the Nazis invaded and occupied Kovno the Kollel were murdered like most of the city’s Jewish residents.

==Innovations==
Until 1877, yeshivas only subsidized students until they got married (at an early age). Rabbi Salanter instituted the practice of paying a small salary to married students to continue their advanced Talmudical studies. He defended this innovation because he said that he was training leaders. His argument was that the need for well-trained communal leaders mandated this drastic action. The justification was that these individuals would eventually serve the community, and it was not that because they sat and learned that they should be supported.

By 1877-1878, ten scholars had begun their full-time studies, following a curriculum which included the study of musar literature. In 1879, Rabbi Spektor became its head. Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel served as the &quot;mashgiach&quot; of the &quot;kollel&quot;. Rabbi Spektor&#x27;s son, Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Rabinowitz accepted the administrative responsibilities and was one of the &quot;roshei kollel&quot; (heads of the &quot;kollel&quot;), while Rabbi Avrohom Shenker and Rabbi Finkel conducted the internal affairs. Under the latter&#x27;s guidance, the book &quot;Eitz Pri&quot; was published, featuring essays by Rabbis Salanter and Spektor - including a foreword by the then lesser-known Rabbi Yisroel Meir HaKohen (the &quot;Chafetz Chaim&quot;).

In 1880, Finkel left the &quot;kollel&quot; so he could devote himself to establishing more &quot;kollelim&quot; throughout Eastern Europe. In 1880, Spektor also left the &quot;Kollel&quot;, and Salanter&#x27;s student Yitzchak Blazer became its new head. Under Blazer&#x27;s direction, the &quot;kollel&quot; came to be &quot;considered by its contemporaries as a bastion of the Mussar movement,&quot; and was attacked by the Mussar movement&#x27;s opponents.

The Kovno Kollel was later transferred to Slabodka, a suburb of Kovno, where Rabbi Shimon Zvi Dubiansky was appointed &quot;rosh kollel&quot; and served there until the outbreak of World War II.
